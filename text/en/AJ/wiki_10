<text>Cuthbert of Lindisfarne ( – 20 March 687) was a saint of the early Northumbrian church in the Celtic tradition. He was a monk, bishop and hermit, associated with the monasteries of Melrose and Lindisfarne in the Kingdom of Northumbria, today in northern England and southern Scotland. Both during his life and after his death, he became a popular medieval saint of Northern England, with a cult centred on his tomb at Durham Cathedral. Cuthbert is regarded as the patron saint of Northumbria. His feast days are 20 March (Catholic Church, Church of England, Eastern Orthodox Church, Episcopal Church) and 4 September (Church in Wales, Catholic Church).

Cuthbert grew up in or around Lauderdale, near Old Melrose Abbey, a daughter-house of Lindisfarne, today in Scotland. He decided to become a monk after seeing a vision on the night in 651 that Aidan, the founder of Lindisfarne, died, but he seems to have experienced some period of military service beforehand. He was made guest-master at the new monastery at Ripon, soon after 655, but had to return with Eata of Hexham to Melrose when Wilfrid was given the monastery instead. About 662 he was made prior at Melrose, and around 665 went as prior to Lindisfarne. In 684 he was made bishop of Lindisfarne, but by late 686 he resigned and returned to his hermitage as he felt he was about to die. He was probably in his early 50s.

==Life==

===Origins and background===
Cuthbert was born (perhaps into a noble family) in Dunbar, then in Northumbria, and now in East Lothian, Scotland, in the mid-630s, some ten years after the conversion of King Edwin of Northumbria to Christianity in 627, which was slowly followed by that of the rest of his people. The politics of the kingdom were violent, and there were later episodes of pagan rule, while spreading understanding of Christianity through the kingdom was a task that lasted throughout Cuthbert&#x27;s lifetime. Edwin had been baptised by Paulinus of York, a Roman who had come with the Gregorian mission from Rome, but his successor Oswald also invited Irish monks from Iona to found the monastery at Lindisfarne where Cuthbert was to spend much of his life. This was around 635, about the time Cuthbert was born.

The tension between the Roman and Celtic Christianity, often exacerbated by Cuthbert&#x27;s near-contemporary Wilfrid, an intransigent and quarrelsome supporter of Roman ways, was to be a major feature of Cuthbert&#x27;s lifetime. Cuthbert himself, though educated in the Celtic tradition, followed his mentor Eata in accepting the Roman forms, apparently without difficulty, after the Synod of Whitby in 664. The earliest biographies concentrate on the many miracles that accompanied even his early life, but he was evidently indefatigable as a travelling priest spreading the Christian message to remote villages, and also well able to impress royalty and nobility. Unlike Wilfrid, his style of life was austere, and when he could, he lived the life of a hermit, though still receiving many visitors.

In Cuthbert&#x27;s time the Kingdom of Northumbria included, in modern terms, northern England and southern Scotland on an intermittent and fluid basis as far north as the Firth of Forth. Cuthbert may have been from the neighbourhood of Dunbar at the mouth of the Firth of Forth in modern-day Scotland, though &quot;The Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs and Other Principal Saints&quot; (&quot;Butler&#x27;s Lives&quot;), by Alban Butler records that he was fostered as a child near Melrose. Fostering is possibly a sign of noble birth, as are references to his riding a horse when young. One night while still a boy, employed as a shepherd, he had a vision of the soul of Aidan being carried to heaven by angels, and later found out that Aidan had died that night. Edwin Burton finds it a suggestion of lowly parentage that as a boy he used to tend sheep on the hills near that monastery. He appears to have undergone military service, but at some point he joined the very new monastery at Melrose, under the prior Boisil. Upon Boisil&#x27;s death in 661, Cuthbert succeeded him as prior. Cuthbert was possibly a second cousin of King Aldfrith of Northumbria (according to Irish genealogies), which may explain his later proposal that Aldfrith should be crowned as monarch.

===Career===

Cuthbert&#x27;s fame for piety, diligence, and obedience grew. When Alchfrith, king of Deira, founded a new monastery at Ripon, Cuthbert became its &quot;praepositus hospitum&quot; or guest master under Eata. When Wilfrid was made abbot of the monastery, Eata and Cuthbert returned to Melrose. Illness struck the monastery in 664 and while Cuthbert recovered, the prior died and Cuthbert was made prior in his place. He spent much time among the people, ministering to their spiritual needs, carrying out missionary journeys, and preaching.

After the Synod of Whitby, Cuthbert seems to have accepted the Roman customs, and his old abbot Eata called on him to introduce them at Lindisfarne as prior there. His asceticism was complemented by his charm and generosity to the poor, and his reputation for gifts of healing and insight led many people to consult him, gaining him the name of &quot;Wonder Worker of Britain&quot;. He continued his missionary work, travelling the breadth of the country from Berwick to Galloway to carry out pastoral work and founding an oratory at Dull, Scotland, complete with a large stone cross, and a little cell for himself. He is also said to have founded St Cuthbert&#x27;s Church in Edinburgh.

===Hermit&#x27;s life===

Cuthbert retired in 676, moved by the desire for a more contemplative life. With his abbot&#x27;s leave, he moved to a spot which Archbishop Eyre identifies with St Cuthbert&#x27;s Island near Lindisfarne, but which Raine thinks was near Holburn, at a place now known as St Cuthbert&#x27;s Cave. Shortly afterwards, Cuthbert moved to Inner Farne island, two miles from Bamburgh, where he gave himself up to a life of great austerity. At first he received visitors, but later he confined himself to his cell and opened his window only to give his blessing. He could not refuse an interview with the holy abbess and royal virgin Elfleda, the daughter of Oswiu of Northumbria, who succeeded St Hilda as abbess of Whitby in 680. The meeting was held on Coquet Island, further south.

===Election as Bishop, Lindisfarne and death===
In 684, Cuthbert was elected Bishop of Hexham at a synod at Twyford (believed to be present-day Alnmouth), but was reluctant to leave his retirement and take up his charge; it was only after a visit from a large group, including King Ecgfrith, that he agreed to return and take up the duties of bishop, but instead as Bishop of Lindisfarne, swapping with Eata, who went to Hexham in Cuthbert&#x27;s place. Cuthbert was consecrated at York by Archbishop Theodore and six bishops, on 26 March 685. But after Christmas 686, he returned to his cell on Inner Farne Island, where he died on 20 March 687, after a painful illness. He was buried at Lindisfarne the same day, and after long journeys escaping the Danes his remains chose, as was thought, to settle at Durham, causing the foundation of the city and Durham Cathedral. The St Cuthbert Gospel is among the objects later recovered from St Cuthbert&#x27;s coffin, which is also an important artefact.

==Legacy==

After Cuthbert&#x27;s death, numerous miracles were attributed to his intercession and to intercessory prayer near his remains. The 8th-century historian Bede wrote both a verse and a prose life of St. Cuthbert around 720. He has been described as &quot;perhaps the most popular saint in Britain prior to the death of Thomas Becket in 1170.&quot; In 698, Cuthbert was reburied at Lindisfarne in the decorated oak coffin now usually meant by St Cuthbert&#x27;s coffin, though he was to have many more coffins. In 995, the &quot;community of Cuthbert&quot; founded and settled at Durham, guided by what they thought was the will of the saint, as the wagon carrying his coffin back to Chester-le-Street after a temporary flight from a Danish invasion became stuck hard on the road.

During the medieval period, Cuthbert became important in defining the identity of the people living in Northumbria north of Tees. Symeon noted that it was the &#x27;people of St Cuthbert&#x27;, that is, &#x27;the whole people between the river Tees and the river Tweed&#x27;, who waged an unsuccessful campaign against the Scots at the Battle of Carham in 1018. By the later 11th century the Bishops of Durham had established a semi-autonomous region known as the Liberty of Durham, later the Palatinate of Durham, between the Tyne and Tees. Within this area the Bishop of Durham had almost as much power as the king of England himself, and the saint became a powerful symbol of the autonomy the region enjoyed. The inhabitants of the Palatinate became known as the &quot;haliwerfolc&quot;, which roughly translates as &quot;people of the saint&quot;, and Cuthbert gained a reputation as fiercely protective of his domain. For example, there is a story that at the Battle of Neville&#x27;s Cross in 1346, the Prior of the Abbey at Durham received a vision of Cuthbert, ordering him to take the corporal cloth of the saint and raise it on a spear point near the battlefield as a banner. Doing this, the Prior and his monks found themselves protected &quot;by the mediation of holy St Cuthbert and the presence of the said holy Relic&quot;. Whether the story of the vision is true or not, the banner of St Cuthbert was regularly carried in battle against the Scots until the Reformation, and it serves as a good example of how St Cuthbert was regarded as a protector of his people. A modern interpretation of the Banner, designed by Northumbria University academic Fiona Raeside-Elliott and embroidered by local textile artist Ruth O&#x27;Leary, is now on display at the saint&#x27;s shrine in Durham Cathedral.

Cuthbert&#x27;s cult also appealed to the converted Danes, who now made up much of the population of Kingdom of York, and was also adopted by the Normans when they took over England. Cuthbert&#x27;s shrine at Durham Cathedral was a major pilgrimage site throughout the Middle Ages, until stripped by Henry VIII&#x27;s commissioners in the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

===Relics===
According to Bede&#x27;s life of the saint, when Cuthbert&#x27;s sarcophagus was opened eleven years after his death, his body was found to have been perfectly preserved or incorrupt. This apparent miracle led to the steady growth of Cuthbert&#x27;s posthumous cultus, to the point where he became the most popular saint of Northern England and Southern Scotland. Numerous miracles were attributed to his intercession and to intercessory prayer near his remains.

In 875 the Danes took the monastery of Lindisfarne and the monks fled, carrying St Cuthbert&#x27;s body with them around various places including Melrose. After seven years&#x27; wandering it found a resting place at the still existing St Cuthbert&#x27;s church in Chester-le-Street until 995, when another Danish invasion led to its removal to Ripon. Then the saint intimated, as it was believed, that he wished to remain in Durham. A new stone church—the so-called &quot;White Church&quot;—was built, the predecessor of the present grand Cathedral. In 999, his relics were enshrined in the new church on 4 September, which is kept as the feast of his translation at Durham Cathedral and as an optional memorial in the Catholic Church in England.
In 1069 Bishop Æthelwine attempted to transport Cuthbert&#x27;s body to Lindisfarne to escape from King William at the start of the Harrying of the North.

In 1104 Cuthbert&#x27;s tomb was opened again and his relics translated to a new shrine behind the altar of the recently completed Cathedral. When the casket was opened, a small book of the Gospel of John, measuring 138 by 92 millimetres (5.4 × 3.6 inches), now known as the Saint Cuthbert Gospel (now British Library Additional MS 89000, formerly known as the Stonyhurst Gospel), was found. This is the oldest Western book to have retained its original bookbinding, in finely decorated leather. Also recovered much later were a set of vestments of 909–916, made of Byzantine silk with a &quot;Nature Goddess&quot; pattern, with a stole and decoration in extremely rare Anglian embroidery or &quot;opus anglicanum&quot;, which had been deposited in his tomb by King Æthelstan (r. 927–939) on a pilgrimage while Cuthbert&#x27;s shrine was at Chester-le-Street.

Cuthbert&#x27;s shrine was destroyed in the Dissolution of the Monasteries, but, unusually, his relics survived and are still interred at the site, although they were also disinterred in the 19th century, when his wooden coffin and various relics were removed. St Cuthbert&#x27;s coffin (actually one of a series of several coffins), as reconstructed by Ernst Kitzinger and others, remains at the cathedral and is an important rare survival of Northumbrian carving on wood. When the coffin was last inspected on 17 May 1827, a &#x27;Saxon&#x27; square cross of gold, embellished with garnets, in the characteristic splayed shape, used later as the heraldic emblem of St Cuthbert in the arms of Durham and Newcastle universities, was found.

===Namesakes===
The flag of County Durham since 2013 features the Cross of St Cuthbert, counterchanged in the county colours of blue and gold. The flag of Kirkcudbrightshire in Scotland since 2016 likewise features the Cross of St Cuthbert, whose name is the origin of the county&#x27;s name. The Cross of St Cuthbert features as the principal charge on the coat of arms of the University of Durham, granted in 1843, blazoned &quot;Argent, a Cross of St Cuthbert Gules, on a canton Azure, a chevron Or, between three lions rampant of the first&quot; (&#x27;A red Cross of St Cuthbert on a silver shield, with three silver fighting lions around a gold chevron on a blue square in the top left-hand corner&#x27;). The Cross also features in the arms of many of its constituent colleges. The University of Newcastle upon Tyne, formerly King&#x27;s College in the University of Durham, also features St Cuthbert&#x27;s Cross on its arms, granted in 1937. The Newcastle University arms are blazoned &quot;Azure, a Cross of St Cuthbert Argent, and on a chief of the last a lion passant guardant Gules.&quot; (&#x27;A silver Cross of St Cuthbert on a blue shield, with a red lion walking and looking towards you on the silver top third portion of the shield.&#x27;) The cross of St Cuthbert also features on the badges of the two Anglican secondary schools in Tyne and Wear, namely Dame Allan&#x27;s Schools and Sunderland High School.

St Cuthbert&#x27;s Society, a college of Durham University established in 1888, is named after him and is located only a short walk from the coffin of the saint at Durham Cathedral. The Society celebrates St Cuthbert&#x27;s Day on or around each 20 March with a feast. &quot;Cuth&#x27;s Day&quot;, the annual college day, is celebrated in the Easter term with music, entertainment, festivities and drinking. Cuddy&#x27;s Corse is a waymarked walking route between Chester-le-Street and Durham Cathedral; it marks the journey between two of the last resting places of the coffin.

Worksop College, founded as St Cuthbert&#x27;s in 1895, was the last of the Woodard Schools to be opened.

St Cuthbert is also the namesake of St Cuthbert&#x27;s College in Epsom, New Zealand; St Cuthbert&#x27;s Day on 21 March is a day of school celebration. The school&#x27;s houses are named after important locations in the life of the saint: Dunblane (yellow), Elgin (green), Iona (purple), Kelso (blue), Lindisfarne (white), Melrose (red), York (orange) and Durham (pink).

St Cuthbert&#x27;s High School, a Roman Catholic school in Newcastle upon Tyne, is named after the saint. St Cuthbert&#x27;s Day is celebrated with Mass, and the school prayers include reference to their patron saint (always ending with the invocation &quot;St Cuthbert, pray for us&quot;). The school badge features a bishop&#x27;s crook in reference to St Cuthbert&#x27;s time as a bishop, as well as ducks, reflecting his love of the animals.

Another Roman Catholic secondary school to bear the name of St Cuthbert is St Cuthbert&#x27;s RC High School in Rochdale. Founded in 1968 as Bishop Henshaw School it was renamed to its current name in the late 1980s. The school&#x27;s badge includes the St Cuthbert Cross and the motto &quot;In Christ We Serve&quot;.

St. Cuthbert&#x27;s Co-operative Society (now Scotmid) opened its first shop in Edinburgh in 1859, and expanded to become one of the largest co-ops in Scotland. Its dairy used horse-drawn delivery floats until 1985, and between 1944 and 1959 employed as a milkman Sean Connery, who later played James Bond.

The Roman Catholic Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle holds St Cuthbert as its patron saint, with the consecration of bishops in the diocese always taking place on 20 March, Cuthbert&#x27;s feast day in the Catholic Church.

Many churches are named after Cuthbert. An Orthodox Community in Chesterfield, England, has taken St Cuthbert as their patron.

Fossilised crinoid columnals extracted from limestone quarried on Lindisfarne, or found washed up along the foreshore, which were threaded into necklaces or rosaries, became known as St. Cuthbert&#x27;s beads.

In Northumberland, the eider duck is known as the cuddy duck. While on the Farne Islands, Cuthbert instituted special laws to protect the ducks and other seabirds nesting on the islands. They still breed in their thousands off the present day Northumberland coast.

In Cumbria, the civil parish and hamlet of Holme St Cuthbert are named after him, as is the parish church. It is a rural area, with one larger village and numerous smaller hamlets.

St Cuthbert&#x27;s Way is a long-distance walking route, one of Scotland&#x27;s Great Trails.

Cuthbert is remembered in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival on 20 March. or alternatively 4 September and in the Roman Catholic Church in England on 4 September.

<doc id="45294" wikidata="Q531716" url="?curid=45294" title="Atmospheric entry">
<text>Atmospheric entry (sometimes listed as Vimpact or Ventry) is the movement of an object from outer space into and through the gases of an atmosphere of a planet, dwarf planet, or natural satellite. Atmospheric entry may be &quot;uncontrolled entry,&quot; as in the entry of astronomical objects, space debris, or bolides. It may be &quot;controlled entry&quot; (or &quot;reentry&quot;) of a spacecraft that can be navigated or follow a predetermined course. Methods for controlled atmospheric &quot;entry, descent, and landing&quot; of spacecraft are collectively termed as &quot;EDL&quot;.
Objects entering an atmosphere experience atmospheric drag, which puts mechanical stress on the object, and aerodynamic heating—caused mostly by compression of the air in front of the object, but also by drag. These forces can cause loss of mass (ablation) or even complete disintegration of smaller objects, and objects with lower compressive strength can explode.

Objects have reentered with speeds ranging from 7.8 km/s for low Earth orbit to around 12.5 km/s for the Stardust probe. They have high kinetic energies, and atmospheric dissipation is the only way of expending this, as it is highly impractical to use retrorockets for the entire reentry procedure. Crewed space vehicles must be slowed to subsonic speeds before parachutes or air brakes may be deployed. 

Ballistic warheads and expendable vehicles do not require slowing at reentry, and in fact, are made streamlined so as to maintain their speed. Furthermore, slow-speed returns to Earth from near-space such as high-altitude parachute jumps from balloons do not require heat shielding because the gravitational acceleration of an object starting at relative rest from within the atmosphere itself (or not far above it) cannot create enough velocity to cause significant atmospheric heating.

For Earth, atmospheric entry occurs by convention at the Kármán line at an altitude of above the surface, while at Venus atmospheric entry occurs at and at Mars atmospheric entry occurs at about . Uncontrolled objects reach high velocities while accelerating through space toward the Earth under the influence of Earth&#x27;s gravity, and are slowed by friction upon encountering Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Meteors are also often travelling quite fast relative to the Earth simply because their own orbital path is different from that of the Earth before they encounter Earth&#x27;s gravity well. Most objects enter at hypersonic speeds due to their sub-orbital (e.g., intercontinental ballistic missile reentry vehicles), orbital (e.g., the Soyuz), or unbounded (e.g., meteors) trajectories. Various advanced technologies have been developed to enable atmospheric reentry and flight at extreme velocities. An alternative method of controlled atmospheric entry is buoyancy which is suitable for planetary entry where thick atmospheres, strong gravity, or both factors complicate high-velocity hyperbolic entry, such as the atmospheres of Venus, Titan and the giant planets.

==History==

The concept of the ablative heat shield was described as early as 1920 by Robert Goddard: &quot;In the case of meteors, which enter the atmosphere with speeds as high as per second, the interior of the meteors remains cold, and the erosion is due, to a large extent, to chipping or cracking of the suddenly heated surface. For this reason, if the outer surface of the apparatus were to consist of layers of a very infusible hard substance with layers of a poor heat conductor between, the surface would not be eroded to any considerable extent, especially as the velocity of the apparatus would not be nearly so great as that of the average meteor.&quot;

Practical development of reentry systems began as the range, and reentry velocity of ballistic missiles increased. For early short-range missiles, like the V-2, stabilization and aerodynamic stress were important issues (many V-2s broke apart during reentry), but heating was not a serious problem. Medium-range missiles like the Soviet R-5, with a range, required ceramic composite heat shielding on separable reentry vehicles (it was no longer possible for the entire rocket structure to survive reentry). The first ICBMs, with ranges of , were only possible with the development of modern ablative heat shields and blunt-shaped vehicles.

In the United States, this technology was pioneered by H. Julian Allen and A. J. Eggers Jr. of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) at Ames Research Center. In 1951, they made the counterintuitive discovery that a blunt shape (high drag) made the most effective heat shield. From simple engineering principles, Allen and Eggers showed that the heat load experienced by an entry vehicle was inversely proportional to the drag coefficient; i.e., the greater the drag, the less the heat load. If the reentry vehicle is made blunt, air cannot &quot;get out of the way&quot; quickly enough, and acts as an air cushion to push the shock wave and heated shock layer forward (away from the vehicle). Since most of the hot gases are no longer in direct contact with the vehicle, the heat energy would stay in the shocked gas and simply move around the vehicle to later dissipate into the atmosphere.

The Allen and Eggers discovery, though initially treated as a military secret, was eventually published in 1958.

==Terminology, definitions and jargon==

When atmospheric entry is part of a spacecraft landing or recovery, particularly on a planetary body other than Earth, entry is part of a phase referred to as &quot;entry, descent, and landing&quot;, or EDL. When the atmospheric entry returns to the same body that the vehicle had launched from, the event is referred to as reentry (almost always referring to Earth entry).

The fundamental design objective in atmospheric entry of a spacecraft is to dissipate the energy of a spacecraft that is traveling at hypersonic speed as it enters an atmosphere such that equipment, cargo, and any passengers are slowed and land near a specific destination on the surface at zero velocity while keeping stresses on the spacecraft and any passengers within acceptable limits. This may be accomplished by propulsive or aerodynamic (vehicle characteristics or parachute) means, or by some combination.

==Entry vehicle shapes==
There are several basic shapes used in designing entry vehicles:

===Sphere or spherical section===

The simplest axisymmetric shape is the sphere or spherical section. This can either be a complete sphere or a spherical section forebody with a converging conical afterbody. The aerodynamics of a sphere or spherical section are easy to model analytically using Newtonian impact theory. Likewise, the spherical section&#x27;s heat flux can be accurately modeled with the Fay–Riddell equation. The static stability of a spherical section is assured if the vehicle&#x27;s center of mass is upstream from the center of curvature (dynamic stability is more problematic). Pure spheres have no lift. However, by flying at an angle of attack, a spherical section has modest aerodynamic lift thus providing some cross-range capability and widening its entry corridor. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, high-speed computers were not yet available and computational fluid dynamics was still embryonic. Because the spherical section was amenable to closed-form analysis, that geometry became the default for conservative design. Consequently, crewed capsules of that era were based upon the spherical section.

Pure spherical entry vehicles were used in the early Soviet Vostok and Voskhod capsules and in Soviet Mars and Venera descent vehicles. The Apollo command module used a spherical section forebody heat shield with a converging conical afterbody. It flew a lifting entry with a hypersonic trim angle of attack of −27° (0° is blunt-end first) to yield an average L/D (lift-to-drag ratio) of 0.368. The resultant lift achieved a measure of cross-range control by offsetting the vehicle&#x27;s center of mass from its axis of symmetry, allowing the lift force to be directed left or right by rolling the capsule on its longitudinal axis. Other examples of the spherical section geometry in crewed capsules are Soyuz/Zond, Gemini, and Mercury. Even these small amounts of lift allow trajectories that have very significant effects on peak g-force, reducing it from 8–9 g for a purely ballistic (slowed only by drag) trajectory to 4–5 g, as well as greatly reducing the peak reentry heat.

===Sphere-cone===
The sphere-cone is a spherical section with a frustum or blunted cone attached. The sphere-cone&#x27;s dynamic stability is typically better than that of a spherical section. The vehicle enters sphere-first. With a sufficiently small half-angle and properly placed center of mass, a sphere-cone can provide aerodynamic stability from Keplerian entry to surface impact. (The &quot;half-angle&quot; is the angle between the cone&#x27;s axis of rotational symmetry and its outer surface, and thus half the angle made by the cone&#x27;s surface edges.)
The original American sphere-cone aeroshell was the Mk-2 RV (reentry vehicle), which was developed in 1955 by the General Electric Corp. The Mk-2&#x27;s design was derived from blunt-body theory and used a radiatively cooled thermal protection system (TPS) based upon a metallic heat shield (the different TPS types are later described in this article). The Mk-2 had significant defects as a weapon delivery system, i.e., it loitered too long in the upper atmosphere due to its lower ballistic coefficient and also trailed a stream of vaporized metal making it very visible to radar. These defects made the Mk-2 overly susceptible to anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems. Consequently, an alternative sphere-cone RV to the Mk-2 was developed by General Electric.
This new RV was the Mk-6 which used a non-metallic ablative TPS, a nylon phenolic. This new TPS was so effective as a reentry heat shield that significantly reduced bluntness was possible. However, the Mk-6 was a huge RV with an entry mass of 3,360 kg, a length of 3.1 m and a half-angle of 12.5°. Subsequent advances in nuclear weapon and ablative TPS design allowed RVs to become significantly smaller with a further reduced bluntness ratio compared to the Mk-6. Since the 1960s, the sphere-cone has become the preferred geometry for modern ICBM RVs with typical half-angles being between 10° and 11°.

Reconnaissance satellite RVs (recovery vehicles) also used a sphere-cone shape and were the first American example of a non-munition entry vehicle (Discoverer-I, launched on 28 February 1959). The sphere-cone was later used for space exploration missions to other celestial bodies or for return from open space; e.g., &quot;Stardust&quot; probe. Unlike with military RVs, the advantage of the blunt body&#x27;s lower TPS mass remained with space exploration entry vehicles like the Galileo Probe with a half-angle of 45° or the Viking aeroshell with a half-angle of 70°. Space exploration sphere-cone entry vehicles have landed on the surface or entered the atmospheres of Mars, Venus, Jupiter, and Titan.
===Biconic===

The biconic is a sphere-cone with an additional frustum attached. The biconic offers a significantly improved L/D ratio. A biconic designed for Mars aerocapture typically has an L/D of approximately 1.0 compared to an L/D of 0.368 for the Apollo-CM. The higher L/D makes a biconic shape better suited for transporting people to Mars due to the lower peak deceleration. Arguably, the most significant biconic ever flown was the &quot;Advanced Maneuverable Reentry Vehicle&quot; (AMaRV). Four AMaRVs were made by the McDonnell Douglas Corp. and represented a significant leap in RV sophistication. Three AMaRVs were launched by Minuteman-1 ICBMs on 20 December 1979, 8 October 1980 and 4 October 1981. AMaRV had an entry mass of approximately 470 kg, a nose radius of 2.34 cm, a forward-frustum half-angle of 10.4°, an inter-frustum radius of 14.6 cm, aft-frustum half-angle of 6°, and an axial length of 2.079 meters. No accurate diagram or picture of AMaRV has ever appeared in the open literature. However, a schematic sketch of an AMaRV-like vehicle along with trajectory plots showing hairpin turns has been published.

AMaRV&#x27;s attitude was controlled through a split body flap (also called a &quot;split-windward flap&quot;) along with two yaw flaps mounted on the vehicle&#x27;s sides. Hydraulic actuation was used for controlling the flaps. AMaRV was guided by a fully autonomous navigation system designed for evading anti-ballistic missile (ABM) interception. The McDonnell Douglas DC-X (also a biconic) was essentially a scaled-up version of AMaRV. AMaRV and the DC-X also served as the basis for an unsuccessful proposal for what eventually became the Lockheed Martin X-33.

===Non-axisymmetric shapes===
Non-axisymmetric shapes have been used for crewed entry vehicles. One example is the winged orbit vehicle that uses a delta wing for maneuvering during descent much like a conventional glider. This approach has been used by the American Space Shuttle, the Soviet Buran and the in-development Starship. The lifting body is another entry vehicle geometry and was used with the X-23 PRIME (Precision Recovery Including Maneuvering Entry) vehicle.

==Entry heating==

Objects entering an atmosphere from space at high velocities relative to the atmosphere will cause very high levels of heating. Atmospheric entry heating comes principally from two sources:
* convection of hot gas flow past the surface of the body and catalytic chemical recombination reactions between the surface and atmospheric gases; and 
*radiation from the energetic shock layer that forms in the front and sides of the body

As velocity increases, both convective and radiative heating increase, but at different rates. At very high speeds, radiative heating will dominate the convective heat fluxes, as radiative heating is proportional to the eighth power of velocity, while convective heating is proportional to the third power of velocity. Radiative heating thus predominates early in atmospheric entry, while convection predominates in the later phases.

During certain intensity of ionization, a &quot;radio-blackout&quot; with the spacecraft is produced.

While NASA&#x27;s Earth entry interface is at , the main heating during controlled entry takes place at altitudes of , peaking at .

===Shock layer gas physics ===
At typical reentry temperatures, the air in the shock layer is both ionized and dissociated. This chemical dissociation necessitates various physical models to describe the shock layer&#x27;s thermal and chemical properties. There are four basic physical models of a gas that are important to aeronautical engineers who design heat shields:

====Perfect gas model====
Almost all aeronautical engineers are taught the perfect (ideal) gas model during their undergraduate education. Most of the important perfect gas equations along with their corresponding tables and graphs are shown in NACA Report 1135. Excerpts from NACA Report 1135 often appear in the appendices of thermodynamics textbooks and are familiar to most aeronautical engineers who design supersonic aircraft.

The perfect gas theory is elegant and extremely useful for designing aircraft but assumes that the gas is chemically inert. From the standpoint of aircraft design, air can be assumed to be inert for temperatures less than at one atmosphere pressure. The perfect gas theory begins to break down at 550 K and is not usable at temperatures greater than . For temperatures greater than 2,000 K, a heat shield designer must use a &quot;real gas model&quot;.

====Real (equilibrium) gas model====
An entry vehicle&#x27;s pitching moment can be significantly influenced by real-gas effects. Both the Apollo command module and the Space Shuttle were designed using incorrect pitching moments determined through inaccurate real-gas modelling. The Apollo-CM&#x27;s trim-angle angle of attack was higher than originally estimated, resulting in a narrower lunar return entry corridor. The actual aerodynamic center of the &quot;Columbia&quot; was upstream from the calculated value due to real-gas effects. On &quot;Columbia&quot;″s maiden flight (STS-1), astronauts John Young and Robert Crippen had some anxious moments during reentry when there was concern about losing control of the vehicle.

An equilibrium real-gas model assumes that a gas is chemically reactive, but also assumes all chemical reactions have had time to complete and all components of the gas have the same temperature (this is called &quot;thermodynamic equilibrium&quot;). When air is processed by a shock wave, it is superheated by compression and chemically dissociates through many different reactions. Direct friction upon the reentry object is not the main cause of shock-layer heating. It is caused mainly from isentropic heating of the air molecules within the compression wave. Friction based entropy increases of the molecules within the wave also account for some heating. The distance from the shock wave to the stagnation point on the entry vehicle&#x27;s leading edge is called &quot;shock wave stand off&quot;. An approximate rule of thumb for shock wave standoff distance is 0.14 times the nose radius. One can estimate the time of travel for a gas molecule from the shock wave to the stagnation point by assuming a free stream velocity of 7.8 km/s and a nose radius of 1 meter, i.e., time of travel is about 18 microseconds. This is roughly the time required for shock-wave-initiated chemical dissociation to approach chemical equilibrium in a shock layer for a 7.8 km/s entry into air during peak heat flux. Consequently, as air approaches the entry vehicle&#x27;s stagnation point, the air effectively reaches chemical equilibrium thus enabling an equilibrium model to be usable. For this case, most of the shock layer between the shock wave and leading edge of an entry vehicle is chemically reacting and &quot;not&quot; in a state of equilibrium. The , which is of extreme importance towards modeling heat flux, owes its validity to the stagnation point being in chemical equilibrium. The time required for the shock layer gas to reach equilibrium is strongly dependent upon the shock layer&#x27;s pressure. For example, in the case of the &quot;Galileo&quot; probe&#x27;s entry into Jupiter&#x27;s atmosphere, the shock layer was mostly in equilibrium during peak heat flux due to the very high pressures experienced (this is counterintuitive given the free stream velocity was 39 km/s during peak heat flux).

Determining the thermodynamic state of the stagnation point is more difficult under an equilibrium gas model than a perfect gas model. Under a perfect gas model, the &quot;ratio of specific heats&quot; (also called &quot;isentropic exponent&quot;, adiabatic index, &quot;gamma&quot;, or &quot;kappa&quot;) is assumed to be constant along with the gas constant. For a real gas, the ratio of specific heats can wildly oscillate as a function of temperature. Under a perfect gas model there is an elegant set of equations for determining thermodynamic state along a constant entropy stream line called the &quot;isentropic chain&quot;. For a real gas, the isentropic chain is unusable and a &quot;Mollier diagram&quot; would be used instead for manual calculation. However, graphical solution with a Mollier diagram is now considered obsolete with modern heat shield designers using computer programs based upon a digital lookup table (another form of Mollier diagram) or a chemistry based thermodynamics program. The chemical composition of a gas in equilibrium with fixed pressure and temperature can be determined through the &quot;Gibbs free energy method&quot;. Gibbs free energy is simply the total enthalpy of the gas minus its total entropy times temperature. A chemical equilibrium program normally does not require chemical formulas or reaction-rate equations. The program works by preserving the original elemental abundances specified for the gas and varying the different molecular combinations of the elements through numerical iteration until the lowest possible Gibbs free energy is calculated (a Newton–Raphson method is the usual numerical scheme). The data base for a Gibbs free energy program comes from spectroscopic data used in defining partition functions. Among the best equilibrium codes in existence is the program &quot;Chemical Equilibrium with Applications&quot; (CEA) which was written by Bonnie J. McBride and Sanford Gordon at NASA Lewis (now renamed &quot;NASA Glenn Research Center&quot;). Other names for CEA are the &quot;Gordon and McBride Code&quot; and the &quot;Lewis Code&quot;. CEA is quite accurate up to 10,000 K for planetary atmospheric gases, but unusable beyond 20,000 K (double ionization is not modelled). CEA can be downloaded from the Internet along with full documentation and will compile on Linux under the G77 Fortran compiler.

====Real (non-equilibrium) gas model====
A non-equilibrium real gas model is the most accurate model of a shock layer&#x27;s gas physics, but is more difficult to solve than an equilibrium model. The simplest non-equilibrium model is the &quot;Lighthill-Freeman model&quot; developed in 1958. The Lighthill-Freeman model initially assumes a gas made up of a single diatomic species susceptible to only one chemical formula and its reverse; e.g., N2 = N + N and N + N = N2 (dissociation and recombination). Because of its simplicity, the Lighthill-Freeman model is a useful pedagogical tool, but is too simple for modelling non-equilibrium air. Air is typically assumed to have a mole fraction composition of 0.7812 molecular nitrogen, 0.2095 molecular oxygen and 0.0093 argon. The simplest real gas model for air is the &quot;five species model&quot;, which is based upon N2, O2, NO, N, and O. The five species model assumes no ionization and ignores trace species like carbon dioxide.

When running a Gibbs free energy equilibrium program, the iterative process from the originally specified molecular composition to the final calculated equilibrium composition is essentially random and not time accurate. With a non-equilibrium program, the computation process is time accurate and follows a solution path dictated by chemical and reaction rate formulas. The five species model has 17 chemical formulas (34 when counting reverse formulas). The Lighthill-Freeman model is based upon a single ordinary differential equation and one algebraic equation. The five species model is based upon 5 ordinary differential equations and 17 algebraic equations. Because the 5 ordinary differential equations are tightly coupled, the system is numerically &quot;stiff&quot; and difficult to solve. The five species model is only usable for entry from low Earth orbit where entry velocity is approximately . For lunar return entry of 11 km/s, the shock layer contains a significant amount of ionized nitrogen and oxygen. The five-species model is no longer accurate and a twelve-species model must be used instead.
Atmospheric entry interface velocities on a Mars–Earth trajectory are on the order of .
Modeling high-speed Mars atmospheric entry—which involves a carbon dioxide, nitrogen and argon atmosphere—is even more complex requiring a 19-species model.

An important aspect of modelling non-equilibrium real gas effects is radiative heat flux. If a vehicle is entering an atmosphere at very high speed (hyperbolic trajectory, lunar return) and has a large nose radius then radiative heat flux can dominate TPS heating. Radiative heat flux during entry into an air or carbon dioxide atmosphere typically comes from asymmetric diatomic molecules; e.g., cyanogen (CN), carbon monoxide, nitric oxide (NO), single ionized molecular nitrogen etc. These molecules are formed by the shock wave dissociating ambient atmospheric gas followed by recombination within the shock layer into new molecular species. The newly formed diatomic molecules initially have a very high vibrational temperature that efficiently transforms the vibrational energy into radiant energy; i.e., radiative heat flux. The whole process takes place in less than a millisecond which makes modelling a challenge. The experimental measurement of radiative heat flux (typically done with shock tubes) along with theoretical calculation through the unsteady Schrödinger equation are among the more esoteric aspects of aerospace engineering. Most of the aerospace research work related to understanding radiative heat flux was done in the 1960s, but largely discontinued after conclusion of the Apollo Program. Radiative heat flux in air was just sufficiently understood to ensure Apollo&#x27;s success. However, radiative heat flux in carbon dioxide (Mars entry) is still barely understood and will require major research.

====Frozen gas model====
The frozen gas model describes a special case of a gas that is not in equilibrium. The name &quot;frozen gas&quot; can be misleading. A frozen gas is not &quot;frozen&quot; like ice is frozen water. Rather a frozen gas is &quot;frozen&quot; in time (all chemical reactions are assumed to have stopped). Chemical reactions are normally driven by collisions between molecules. If gas pressure is slowly reduced such that chemical reactions can continue then the gas can remain in equilibrium. However, it is possible for gas pressure to be so suddenly reduced that almost all chemical reactions stop. For that situation the gas is considered frozen.

The distinction between equilibrium and frozen is important because it is possible for a gas such as air to have significantly different properties (speed-of-sound, viscosity etc.) for the same thermodynamic state; e.g., pressure and temperature. Frozen gas can be a significant issue in the wake behind an entry vehicle. During reentry, free stream air is compressed to high temperature and pressure by the entry vehicle&#x27;s shock wave. Non-equilibrium air in the shock layer is then transported past the entry vehicle&#x27;s leading side into a region of rapidly expanding flow that causes freezing. The frozen air can then be entrained into a trailing vortex behind the entry vehicle. Correctly modelling the flow in the wake of an entry vehicle is very difficult. Thermal protection shield (TPS) heating in the vehicle&#x27;s afterbody is usually not very high, but the geometry and unsteadiness of the vehicle&#x27;s wake can significantly influence aerodynamics (pitching moment) and particularly dynamic stability.

==Thermal protection systems==

A thermal protection system, or TPS, is the barrier that protects a spacecraft during the searing heat of atmospheric reentry. Multiple approaches for the thermal protection of spacecraft are in use, among them ablative heat shields, passive cooling, and active cooling of spacecraft surfaces. In general they can be divided into two categories: ablative TPS and reusable TPS. 

Ablative TPS are required when space craft reach a relatively low altitude before slowing down. Spacecraft like the space shuttle are designed to slow down at high altitude so that they can use reuseable TPS. (see: Space Shuttle thermal protection system). 

Thermal protection systems are tested in high enthalpy ground testing or plasma wind tunnels that reproduce the combination of high enthalpy and high stagnation pressure using Induction plasma or DC plasma.

===Ablative===

The ablative heat shield functions by lifting the hot shock layer gas away from the heat shield&#x27;s outer wall (creating a cooler boundary layer). The boundary layer comes from &quot;blowing&quot; of gaseous reaction products from the heat shield material and provides protection against all forms of heat flux. The overall process of reducing the heat flux experienced by the heat shield&#x27;s outer wall by way of a boundary layer is called &quot;blockage&quot;. Ablation occurs at two levels in an ablative TPS: the outer surface of the TPS material chars, melts, and sublimes, while the bulk of the TPS material undergoes pyrolysis and expels product gases. The gas produced by pyrolysis is what drives blowing and causes blockage of convective and catalytic heat flux. Pyrolysis can be measured in real time using thermogravimetric analysis, so that the ablative performance can be evaluated. Ablation can also provide blockage against radiative heat flux by introducing carbon into the shock layer thus making it optically opaque. Radiative heat flux blockage was the primary thermal protection mechanism of the Galileo Probe TPS material (carbon phenolic). 

Early research on ablation technology in the USA was centered at NASA&#x27;s Ames Research Center located at Moffett Field, California. Ames Research Center was ideal, since it had numerous wind tunnels capable of generating varying wind velocities. Initial experiments typically mounted a mock-up of the ablative material to be analyzed within a hypersonic wind tunnel. Testing of ablative materials occurs at the Ames Arc Jet Complex. Many spacecraft thermal protection systems have been tested in this facility, including the Apollo, space shuttle, and Orion heat shield materials.

====Carbon phenolic====
Carbon phenolic was originally developed as a rocket nozzle throat material (used in the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster) and for reentry-vehicle nose tips.
The thermal conductivity of a particular TPS material is usually proportional to the material&#x27;s density. Carbon phenolic is a very effective ablative material, but also has high density which is undesirable.

The NASA Galileo Probe used carbon phenolic for its TPS material.

If the heat flux experienced by an entry vehicle is insufficient to cause pyrolysis then the TPS material&#x27;s conductivity could allow heat flux conduction into the TPS bondline material thus leading to TPS failure. Consequently, for entry trajectories causing lower heat flux, carbon phenolic is sometimes inappropriate and lower-density TPS materials such as the following examples can be better design choices:

====Super light-weight ablator====
&quot;SLA&quot; in &quot;SLA-561V&quot; stands for &quot;super light-weight ablator&quot;. SLA-561V is a proprietary ablative made by Lockheed Martin that has been used as the primary TPS material on all of the 70° sphere-cone entry vehicles sent by NASA to Mars other than the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL). SLA-561V begins significant ablation at a heat flux of approximately 110 W/cm2, but will fail for heat fluxes greater than 300 W/cm2. The MSL aeroshell TPS is currently designed to withstand a peak heat flux of 234 W/cm2. The peak heat flux experienced by the &quot;Viking 1&quot; aeroshell which landed on Mars was 21 W/cm2. For &quot;Viking 1&quot;, the TPS acted as a charred thermal insulator and never experienced significant ablation. &quot;Viking 1&quot; was the first Mars lander and based upon a very conservative design. The Viking aeroshell had a base diameter of 3.54 meters (the largest used on Mars until Mars Science Laboratory). SLA-561V is applied by packing the ablative material into a honeycomb core that is pre-bonded to the aeroshell&#x27;s structure thus enabling construction of a large heat shield.

====Phenolic-impregnated carbon ablator====

&quot;Phenolic-impregnated carbon ablator&quot; (PICA), a carbon fiber preform impregnated in phenolic resin, is a modern TPS material and has the advantages of low density (much lighter than carbon phenolic) coupled with efficient ablative ability at high heat flux. It is a good choice for ablative applications such as high-peak-heating conditions found on sample-return missions or lunar-return missions. PICA&#x27;s thermal conductivity is lower than other high-heat-flux-ablative materials, such as conventional carbon phenolics.

PICA was patented by NASA Ames Research Center in the 1990s and was the primary TPS material for the Stardust aeroshell. The Stardust sample-return capsule was the fastest man-made object ever to reenter Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, at 28,000 mph (ca. 12.5 km/s) at 135 km altitude. This was faster than the Apollo mission capsules and 70% faster than the Shuttle. PICA was critical for the viability of the Stardust mission, which returned to Earth in 2006. Stardust&#x27;s heat shield (0.81 m base diameter) was made of one monolithic piece sized to withstand a nominal peak heating rate of 1.2 kW/cm2. A PICA heat shield was also used for the Mars Science Laboratory entry into the Martian atmosphere.

=====PICA-X=====
An improved and easier to produce version called PICA-X was developed by SpaceX in 2006–2010 for the Dragon space capsule. The first reentry test of a PICA-X heat shield was on the Dragon C1 mission on 8 December 2010. The PICA-X heat shield was designed, developed and fully qualified by a small team of a dozen engineers and technicians in less than four years.
PICA-X is ten times less expensive to manufacture than the NASA PICA heat shield material.

=====PICA-3=====
A second enhanced version of PICA—called PICA-3—was developed by SpaceX during the mid-2010s. It was first flight tested on the Crew Dragon spacecraft in 2019 during the flight demonstration mission, in April 2019, and put into regular service on that spacecraft in 2020.

===== HARLEM =====
PICA and most other ablative TPS materials are either proprietary or classified, with formulations and manufacturing processes not disclosed in the open literature. This limits the ability of researchers to study these materials and hinders the development of thermal protection systems. Thus, the High Enthalpy Flow Diagnostics Group (HEFDiG) at the University of Stuttgart has developed an open carbon-phenolic ablative material, called the HEFDiG Ablation-Research Laboratory Experiment Material (HARLEM), from commercially available materials. HARLEM is prepared by impregnating a preform of a carbon fiber porous monolith (such as Calcarb rigid carbon insulation) with a solution of resole phenolic resin and polyvinylpyrrolidone in ethylene glycol, heating to polymerize the resin and then removing the solvent under vacuum. The resulting material is cured and machined to the desired shape.

====SIRCA====

Silicone-impregnated reusable ceramic ablator (SIRCA) was also developed at NASA Ames Research Center and was used on the Backshell Interface Plate (BIP) of the &quot;Mars Pathfinder&quot; and Mars Exploration Rover (MER) aeroshells. The BIP was at the attachment points between the aeroshell&#x27;s backshell (also called the afterbody or aft cover) and the cruise ring (also called the cruise stage). SIRCA was also the primary TPS material for the unsuccessful Deep Space 2 (DS/2) Mars impactor probes with their aeroshells. SIRCA is a monolithic, insulating material that can provide thermal protection through ablation. It is the only TPS material that can be machined to custom shapes and then applied directly to the spacecraft. There is no post-processing, heat treating, or additional coatings required (unlike Space Shuttle tiles). Since SIRCA can be machined to precise shapes, it can be applied as tiles, leading edge sections, full nose caps, or in any number of custom shapes or sizes. , SIRCA had been demonstrated in backshell interface applications, but not yet as a forebody TPS material.

====AVCOAT====
AVCOAT is a NASA-specified ablative heat shield, a glass-filled epoxy–novolac system.

NASA originally used it for the Apollo command module in the 1960s, and then utilized the material for its next-generation beyond low Earth orbit Orion crew module, which first flew in a December 2014 test and then operationally in November 2022. The Avcoat to be used on Orion has been reformulated to meet environmental legislation that has been passed since the end of Apollo.

===Thermal soak===
Thermal soak is a part of almost all TPS schemes. For example, an ablative heat shield loses most of its thermal protection effectiveness when the outer wall temperature drops below the minimum necessary for pyrolysis. From that time to the end of the heat pulse, heat from the shock layer convects into the heat shield&#x27;s outer wall and would eventually conduct to the payload. This outcome can be prevented by ejecting the heat shield (with its heat soak) prior to the heat conducting to the inner wall.

===Refractory insulation===

Refractory insulation keeps the heat in the outermost layer of the spacecraft surface, where it is conducted away by the air. The temperature of the surface rises to incandescent levels, so the material must have a very high melting point, and the material must also exhibit very low thermal conductivity. Materials with these properties tend to be brittle, delicate, and difficult to fabricate in large sizes, so they are generally fabricated as relatively small tiles that are then attached to the structural skin of the spacecraft. There is a tradeoff between toughness and thermal conductivity: less conductive materials are generally more brittle. The space shuttle used multiple types of tiles. Tiles are also used on the Boeing X-37, Dream Chaser, and Starship&#x27;s upper stage.

Because insulation cannot be perfect, some heat energy is stored in the insulation and in the underlying material (&quot;thermal soaking&quot;) and must be dissipated after the spacecraft exits the high-temperature flight regime. Some of this heat will re-radiate through the surface or will be carried off the surface by convection, but some will heat the spacecraft structure and interior, which may require active cooling after landing.

Typical Space Shuttle TPS tiles (LI-900) have remarkable thermal protection properties. An LI-900 tile exposed to a temperature of 1,000 K on one side will remain merely warm to the touch on the other side. However, they are relatively brittle and break easily, and cannot survive in-flight rain.

===Passively cooled===

In some early ballistic missile RVs (e.g., the Mk-2 and the sub-orbital Mercury spacecraft), &quot;radiatively cooled TPS&quot; were used to initially absorb heat flux during the heat pulse, and, then, after the heat pulse, radiate and convect the stored heat back into the atmosphere. However, the earlier version of this technique required a considerable quantity of metal TPS (e.g., titanium, beryllium, copper, etc.). Modern designers prefer to avoid this added mass by using ablative and thermal-soak TPS instead.

Thermal protection systems relying on emissivity use high emissivity coatings (HECs) to facilitate radiative cooling, while an underlying porous ceramic layer serves to protect the structure from high surface temperatures. High thermally stable emissivity values coupled with low thermal conductivity are key to the functionality of such systems.

Radiatively cooled TPS can be found on modern entry vehicles, but reinforced carbon–carbon (RCC) (also called &quot;carbon–carbon&quot;) is normally used instead of metal. RCC was the TPS material on the Space Shuttle&#x27;s nose cone and wing leading edges, and was also proposed as the leading-edge material for the X-33. Carbon is the most refractory material known, with a one-atmosphere sublimation temperature of for graphite. This high temperature made carbon an obvious choice as a radiatively cooled TPS material. Disadvantages of RCC are that it is currently expensive to manufacture, is heavy, and lacks robust impact resistance.

Some high-velocity aircraft, such as the SR-71 Blackbird and Concorde, deal with heating similar to that experienced by spacecraft, but at much lower intensity, and for hours at a time. Studies of the SR-71&#x27;s titanium skin revealed that the metal structure was restored to its original strength through annealing due to aerodynamic heating. In the case of the Concorde, the aluminium nose was permitted to reach a maximum operating temperature of (approximately warmer than the normally sub-zero, ambient air); the metallurgical implications (loss of temper) that would be associated with a higher peak temperature were the most significant factors determining the top speed of the aircraft.

A radiatively cooled TPS for an entry vehicle is often called a &quot;hot-metal TPS&quot;. Early TPS designs for the Space Shuttle called for a hot-metal TPS based upon a nickel superalloy (dubbed René 41) and titanium shingles. This Shuttle TPS concept was rejected, because it was believed a silica tile-based TPS would involve lower development and manufacturing costs. A nickel superalloy-shingle TPS was again proposed for the unsuccessful X-33 single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) prototype.

Recently, newer radiatively cooled TPS materials have been developed that could be superior to RCC. Known as Ultra-High Temperature Ceramics, they were developed for the prototype vehicle Slender Hypervelocity Aerothermodynamic Research Probe (SHARP). These TPS materials are based on zirconium diboride and hafnium diboride. SHARP TPS have suggested performance improvements allowing for sustained Mach 7 flight at sea level, Mach 11 flight at altitudes, and significant improvements for vehicles designed for continuous hypersonic flight. SHARP TPS materials enable sharp leading edges and nose cones to greatly reduce drag for airbreathing combined-cycle-propelled spaceplanes and lifting bodies. SHARP materials have exhibited effective TPS characteristics from zero to more than , with melting points over . They are structurally stronger than RCC, and, thus, do not require structural reinforcement with materials such as Inconel. SHARP materials are extremely efficient at reradiating absorbed heat, thus eliminating the need for additional TPS behind and between the SHARP materials and conventional vehicle structure. NASA initially funded (and discontinued) a multi-phase R&amp;D program through the University of Montana in 2001 to test SHARP materials on test vehicles.

===Actively cooled===
Various advanced reusable spacecraft and hypersonic aircraft designs have been proposed to employ heat shields made from temperature-resistant metal alloys that incorporate a refrigerant or cryogenic fuel circulating through them.

Such a TPS concept was proposed for the X-30 National Aerospace Plane (NASP) in the mid-80s. The NASP was supposed to have been a scramjet powered hypersonic aircraft, but failed in development.

In 2005 and 2012, two unmanned lifting body craft with actively cooled hulls were launched as a part of the German Sharp Edge Flight Experiment (SHEFEX).

In early 2019, SpaceX was developing an actively cooled heat shield for its Starship spacecraft where a part of the thermal protection system will be a transpirationally cooled outer-skin design for the reentering spaceship. However, SpaceX abandoned this approach in favor of a modern version of heat shield tiles later in 2019.

The Stoke Space Nova second stage, announced in October 2023 and not yet flying, uses a regeneratively cooled (by liquid hydrogen) heat shield.

In the early 1960s various TPS systems were proposed to use water or other cooling liquid sprayed into the shock layer, or passed through channels in the heat shield. Advantages included the possibility of more all-metal designs which would be cheaper to develop, be more rugged, and eliminate the need for classified and unknown technology. The disadvantages are increased weight and complexity, and lower reliability. The concept has never been flown, but a similar technology (the plug nozzle) did undergo extensive ground testing.

===Propulsive entry===

Fuel permitting, nothing prevents a vehicle from entering the atmosphere with a retrograde engine burn, which has the double effect of slowing the vehicle down much faster than atmospheric drag alone would, and forcing the compressed hot air away from the vehicle&#x27;s body. During reentry, the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 performs an entry burn to rapidly decelerate from its initial hypersonic speed.

==High-drag suborbital entry==
In 2004, aircraft designer Burt Rutan demonstrated the feasibility of a shape-changing airfoil for reentry with the sub-orbital SpaceShipOne. The wings on this craft rotate upward into the &quot;feathered configuration&quot; that provides a shuttlecock effect. Thus SpaceShipOne achieves much more aerodynamic drag on reentry while not experiencing significant thermal loads.

The configuration increases drag, as the craft is now less streamlined and results in more atmospheric gas particles hitting the spacecraft at higher altitudes than otherwise. The aircraft thus slows down more in higher atmospheric layers which is the key to efficient reentry. Secondly, the aircraft will &quot;automatically&quot; orient itself in this state to a high drag attitude.

However, the velocity attained by SpaceShipOne prior to reentry is much lower than that of an orbital spacecraft, and engineers, including Rutan, recognize that a feathered reentry technique is not suitable for return from orbit.

On 4 May 2011, the first test on the SpaceShipTwo of the feathering mechanism was made during a glideflight after release
from the White Knight Two. Premature deployment of the feathering system was responsible for the 2014 VSS &quot;Enterprise&quot; crash, in which the aircraft disintegrated, killing the co-pilot.

The feathered reentry was first described by Dean Chapman of NACA in 1958. In the section of his report on &quot;Composite Entry&quot;, Chapman described a solution to the problem using a high-drag device:

== Inflatable heat shield entry==

Deceleration for atmospheric reentry, especially for higher-speed Mars-return missions, benefits from maximizing &quot;the drag area of the entry system. The larger the diameter of the aeroshell, the bigger the payload can be.&quot; An inflatable aeroshell provides one alternative for enlarging the drag area with a low-mass design.

===Russia===

Such an inflatable shield/aerobrake was designed for the penetrators of Mars 96 mission. Since the mission failed due to the launcher malfunction, the NPO Lavochkin and DASA/ESA have designed a mission for Earth orbit. The Inflatable Reentry and Descent Technology (IRDT) demonstrator was launched on Soyuz-Fregat on 8 February 2000. The inflatable shield was designed as a cone with two stages of inflation. Although the second stage of the shield failed to inflate, the demonstrator survived the orbital reentry and was recovered. The subsequent missions flown on the Volna rocket failed due to launcher failure.

===NASA IRVE ===

NASA launched an inflatable heat shield experimental spacecraft on 17 August 2009 with the successful first test flight of the Inflatable Re-entry Vehicle Experiment (IRVE). The heat shield had been vacuum-packed into a payload shroud and launched on a Black Brant 9 sounding rocket from NASA&#x27;s Wallops Flight Facility on Wallops Island, Virginia. &quot;Nitrogen inflated the heat shield, made of several layers of silicone-coated [Kevlar] fabric, to a mushroom shape in space several minutes after liftoff.&quot; The rocket apogee was at an altitude of where it began its descent to supersonic speed. Less than a minute later the shield was released from its cover to inflate at an altitude of . The inflation of the shield took less than 90 seconds.

=== NASA HIAD ===
Following the success of the initial IRVE experiments, NASA developed the concept into the more ambitious Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (HIAD). The current design is shaped like a shallow cone, with the structure built up as a stack of circular inflated tubes of gradually increasing major diameter. The forward (convex) face of the cone is covered with a flexible thermal protection system robust enough to withstand the stresses of atmospheric entry (or reentry).

In 2012, a HIAD was tested as Inflatable Reentry Vehicle Experiment 3 (IRVE-3) using a sub-orbital sounding rocket, and worked.

See also Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator, a NASA project with tests in 2014 and 2015 of a 6 m diameter SIAD-R.

=== LOFTID ===

A inflatable reentry vehicle, &quot;Low-Earth Orbit Flight Test of an Inflatable Decelerator&quot; (LOFTID), was launched in November 2022, inflated in orbit, reentered faster than Mach 25, and was successfully recovered on November 10.

==Entry vehicle design considerations==

There are four critical parameters considered when designing a vehicle for atmospheric entry:

# Peak heat flux
# Heat load
# Peak deceleration
# Peak dynamic pressure

Peak heat flux and dynamic pressure selects the TPS material. Heat load selects the thickness of the TPS material stack. Peak deceleration is of major importance for crewed missions. The upper limit for crewed return to Earth from low Earth orbit (LEO) or lunar return is 10&quot;g&quot;. For Martian atmospheric entry after long exposure to zero gravity, the upper limit is 4&quot;g&quot;. Peak dynamic pressure can also influence the selection of the outermost TPS material if spallation is an issue. The reentry vehicle&#x27;s design parameters may be assessed through numerical simulation, including simplifications of the vehicle&#x27;s dynamics, such as the planar reentry equations and heat flux correlations.

Starting from the principle of &quot;conservative design&quot;, the engineer typically considers two worst-case trajectories, the undershoot and overshoot trajectories. The overshoot trajectory is typically defined as the shallowest-allowable entry velocity angle prior to atmospheric skip-off. The overshoot trajectory has the highest heat load and sets the TPS thickness. The undershoot trajectory is defined by the steepest allowable trajectory. For crewed missions the steepest entry angle is limited by the peak deceleration. The undershoot trajectory also has the highest peak heat flux and dynamic pressure. Consequently, the undershoot trajectory is the basis for selecting the TPS material. There is no &quot;one size fits all&quot; TPS material. A TPS material that is ideal for high heat flux may be too conductive (too dense) for a long duration heat load. A low-density TPS material might lack the tensile strength to resist spallation if the dynamic pressure is too high. A TPS material can perform well for a specific peak heat flux, but fail catastrophically for the same peak heat flux if the wall pressure is significantly increased (this happened with NASA&#x27;s R-4 test spacecraft). Older TPS materials tend to be more labor-intensive and expensive to manufacture compared to modern materials. However, modern TPS materials often lack the flight history of the older materials (an important consideration for a risk-averse designer).

Based upon Allen and Eggers discovery, maximum aeroshell bluntness (maximum drag) yields minimum TPS mass. Maximum bluntness (minimum ballistic coefficient) also yields a minimal terminal velocity at maximum altitude (very important for Mars EDL, but detrimental for military RVs). However, there is an upper limit to bluntness imposed by aerodynamic stability considerations based upon &quot;shock wave detachment&quot;. A shock wave will remain attached to the tip of a sharp cone if the cone&#x27;s half-angle is below a critical value. This critical half-angle can be estimated using perfect gas theory (this specific aerodynamic instability occurs below hypersonic speeds). For a nitrogen atmosphere (Earth or Titan), the maximum allowed half-angle is approximately 60°. For a carbon dioxide atmosphere (Mars or Venus), the maximum-allowed half-angle is approximately 70°. After shock wave detachment, an entry vehicle must carry significantly more shocklayer gas around the leading edge stagnation point (the subsonic cap). Consequently, the aerodynamic center moves upstream thus causing aerodynamic instability. It is incorrect to reapply an aeroshell design intended for Titan entry (&quot;Huygens&quot; probe in a nitrogen atmosphere) for Mars entry (&quot;Beagle 2&quot; in a carbon dioxide atmosphere). Prior to being abandoned, the Soviet Mars lander program achieved one successful landing (Mars 3), on the second of three entry attempts (the others were Mars 2 and Mars 6). The Soviet Mars landers were based upon a 60° half-angle aeroshell design.

A 45° half-angle sphere-cone is typically used for atmospheric probes (surface landing not intended) even though TPS mass is not minimized. The rationale for a 45° half-angle is to have either aerodynamic stability from entry-to-impact (the heat shield is not jettisoned) or a short-and-sharp heat pulse followed by prompt heat shield jettison. A 45° sphere-cone design was used with the DS/2 Mars impactor and Pioneer Venus probes.

==Atmospheric entry accidents==
Not all atmospheric reentries have been completely successful:

*Voskhod 2 – The service module failed to detach for some time, but the crew survived.
*Soyuz 5 – The service module failed to detach, but the crew survived.
*Apollo 15 - One of the three ringsail parachutes failed during the ocean landing, likely damaged as the spacecraft vented excess control fuel. The spacecraft was designed to land safely with only two parachutes, and the crew were uninjured.
*Mars Polar Lander – Failed during EDL. The failure was believed to be the consequence of a software error. The precise cause is unknown for lack of real-time telemetry.
*Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; STS-1 – a combination of launch damage, protruding gap filler, and tile installation error resulted in serious damage to the orbiter, only some of which the crew was aware. Had the crew known the extent of the damage before attempting reentry, they would have flown the shuttle to a safe altitude and then bailed out. Nevertheless, reentry was successful, and the orbiter proceeded to a normal landing.
*Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; STS-27 – Insulation from the starboard solid rocket booster nose cap struck the orbiter during launch, causing significant tile damage. This dislodged one tile completely, over an aluminum mounting plate for a TACAN antenna. The antenna sustained extreme heat damage, but prevented the hot gas from penetrating the vehicle body.

*&quot;Genesis&quot; – The parachute failed to deploy due to a G-switch having been installed backwards (a similar error delayed parachute deployment for the &quot;Galileo&quot; Probe). Consequently, the Genesis entry vehicle crashed into the desert floor. The payload was damaged, but most scientific data were recoverable.
*Soyuz TMA-11 – The Soyuz propulsion module failed to separate properly; fallback ballistic reentry was executed that subjected the crew to accelerations of about . The crew survived.
*Starship IFT-3: The SpaceX Starship&#x27;s third integrated test flight was supposed to end with a hard splashdown in the Indian Ocean. However, approximately 48.5 minutes after launch, at an altitude of 65km, contact with the spacecraft was lost, indicating that it burned up on reentry. This was caused by excessive vehicle rolling due to clogged vents on the vehicle.

Some reentries have resulted in significant disasters:

*Soyuz 1 – The attitude control system failed while still in orbit and later parachutes got entangled during the emergency landing sequence (entry, descent, and landing (EDL) failure). Lone cosmonaut Vladimir Mikhailovich Komarov died.
*Soyuz 11 – During tri-module separation, a valve seal was opened by the shock, depressurizing the descent module; the crew of three asphyxiated in space minutes before reentry.
*Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; STS-107 – The failure of a reinforced carbon–carbon panel on a wing leading edge caused by debris impact at launch led to breakup of the orbiter on reentry resulting in the deaths of all seven crew members.

==Uncontrolled and unprotected entries==

Of satellites that reenter, approximately 10–40% of the mass of the object may reach the surface of the Earth. On average, about one catalogued object reentered per day .

Because the Earth&#x27;s surface is predominantly water, most objects that survive reentry land in one of the world&#x27;s oceans. The estimated chance that a given person would get hit and injured during their lifetime is around 1 in a trillion.

On January 24, 1978, the Soviet Kosmos 954 () reentered and crashed near Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories of Canada. The satellite was nuclear-powered and left radioactive debris near its impact site.

On July 11, 1979, the US Skylab space station () reentered and spread debris across the Australian Outback. The reentry was a major media event largely due to the Cosmos 954 incident, but not viewed as much as a potential disaster since it did not carry toxic nuclear or hydrazine fuel. NASA had originally hoped to use a Space Shuttle mission to either extend its life or enable a controlled reentry, but delays in the Shuttle program, plus unexpectedly high solar activity, made this impossible.

On February 7, 1991, the Soviet Salyut 7 space station (), with the Kosmos 1686 module () attached, reentered and scattered debris over the town of Capitán Bermúdez, Argentina. The station had been boosted to a higher orbit in August 1986 in an attempt to keep it up until 1994, but in a scenario similar to Skylab, the planned Buran shuttle was cancelled and high solar activity caused it to come down sooner than expected.

On September 7, 2011, NASA announced the impending uncontrolled reentry of the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite () and noted that there was a small risk to the public. The decommissioned satellite reentered the atmosphere on September 24, 2011, and some pieces are presumed to have crashed into the South Pacific Ocean over a debris field long.

On April 1, 2018, the Chinese Tiangong-1 space station () reentered over the Pacific Ocean, halfway between Australia and South America. The China Manned Space Engineering Office had intended to control the reentry, but lost telemetry and control in March 2017.

On May 11, 2020, the core stage of Chinese Long March 5B (COSPAR ID 2020-027C) weighing roughly ) made an uncontrolled reentry over the Atlantic Ocean, near West African coast. Few pieces of rocket debris reportedly survived reentry and fell over at least two villages in Ivory Coast.

On May 8, 2021, the core stage of Chinese Long March 5B (COSPAR ID 2021-0035B) weighing ) made an uncontrolled reentry, just west of the Maldives in the Indian Ocean (approximately 72.47°E longitude and 2.65°N latitude). Witnesses reported rocket debris as far away as the Arabian peninsula.

===Deorbit disposal===
Salyut 1, the world&#x27;s first space station, was deliberately de-orbited into the Pacific Ocean in 1971 following the Soyuz 11 accident. Its successor, Salyut 6, was de-orbited in a controlled manner as well.

On June 4, 2000, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory was deliberately de-orbited after one of its gyroscopes failed. The debris that did not burn up fell harmlessly into the Pacific Ocean. The observatory was still operational, but the failure of another gyroscope would have made de-orbiting much more difficult and dangerous. With some controversy, NASA decided in the interest of public safety that a controlled crash was preferable to letting the craft come down at random.

In 2001, the Russian &quot;Mir&quot; space station was deliberately de-orbited, and broke apart in the fashion expected by the command center during atmospheric reentry. Mir entered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere on March 23, 2001, near Nadi, Fiji, and fell into the South Pacific Ocean.

On February 21, 2008, a disabled U.S. spy satellite, USA-193, was hit at an altitude of approximately with an SM-3 missile fired from the U.S. Navy cruiser off the coast of Hawaii. The satellite was inoperative, having failed to reach its intended orbit when it was launched in 2006. Due to its rapidly deteriorating orbit it was destined for uncontrolled reentry within a month. U.S. Department of Defense expressed concern that the fuel tank containing highly toxic hydrazine might survive reentry to reach the Earth&#x27;s surface intact. Several governments including those of Russia, China, and Belarus protested the action as a thinly-veiled demonstration of US anti-satellite capabilities. China had previously caused an international incident when it tested an anti-satellite missile in 2007.

==Environmental impact==

Atmospheric entry has a measurable impact on Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, particularly the stratosphere.

Atmospheric entry by spacecrafts accounted for 3% of all atmospheric entries by 2021, but in a scenario in which the number of satellites since 2019 are doubled, artificial entries would make 40% of all entries, which would cause atmospheric aerosols to be 94% artificial. The impact of spacecrafts burning up in the atmosphere during artificial atmospheric entry is different to meteors due to the spacecrafts&#x27; generally larger size and different composition. The atmospheric pollutants produced by artificial atmospheric burning-up have been traced in the atmosphere and identified as reacting and possibly negatively impacting the composition of the atmosphere and particularly the ozone layer.

Considering space sustainability in regard to atmospheric impact of re-entry is by 2022 just developing and has been identified in 2024 as suffering from &quot;atmosphere-blindness&quot;, causing global environmental injustice. This is identified as a result of the current end-of life spacecraft management, which favors the station keeping practice of controlled re-entry. This is mainly done to prevent the dangers from uncontrolled atmospheric entries and space debris.

Suggested alternatives are the use of less polluting materials and by in-orbit servicing and potentially in-space recycling.

<doc id="45302" wikidata="Q254402" url="?curid=45302" title="Saint Rosalia">
<text>Rosalia (; ; 1130–1166), nicknamed (&quot;the Little Saint&quot;), is the patron saint of Palermo in Italy, Camargo in Chihuahua, and three towns in Venezuela: El Hatillo, , and El Playón. She is especially important internationally as a saint invoked in times of plague. From 2020 onwards she has been invoked by some citizens of Palermo to protect the city from COVID-19.

== Life ==
Rosalia was born of a Norman noble family that claimed descent from Charlemagne. Devoutly religious, she retired to live as a hermit in a cave on Mount Pellegrino, where she died alone in 1166. Tradition says that she was led to the cave by two angels. On the cave wall she wrote &quot;I, Rosalia, daughter of Sinibald, Lord of [Monte] delle Rose, and Quisquina, have taken the resolution to live in this cave for the love of my Lord, Jesus Christ.&quot;

== 1624 plague ==
In 1624, a plague beset Palermo. During this hardship Rosalia reportedly appeared first to a sick woman, then to a hunter, to whom she indicated where her remains were to be found. She ordered him to bring her bones to Palermo and have them carried in procession through the city.

The hunter climbed the mountain and found her bones in the cave as described. He did what she had asked in the apparition. After her remains were carried around the city three times, the plague ceased. After this Rosalia was venerated as the patron saint of Palermo, and a sanctuary was built in the cave where her remains were discovered.

Her post-1624 iconography is dominated by the work of the Flemish painter Anthony van Dyck, who was trapped in the city during the 1624–1625 quarantine, during which time he produced five paintings of Rosalia, now in Madrid, Houston, London, New York and Palermo itself. In 1629 he also produced &quot;Saint Rosalia Interceding for the City of Palermo&quot; and &quot;Coronation of Saint Rosalia&quot; to assist Jesuit efforts to spread devotion to her beyond Sicily.

== Veneration ==
In Palermo, the Festino di Santa Rosalia is held each year on 14 July, and continues into the next day. It is a major social and religious event in the city.

on feast of St. Rosalia on 4 September.

The devotion to Santa Rosalia is widespread among the large and mainly Hindu Tamil community of Sri Lankan origin settled in Palermo.

On 4 September, a tradition of walking barefoot from Palermo up to the Sanctuary of Santa Rosalia high up on Mount Pellegrino is observed in honor of Rosalia. In Italian-American communities in the United States, the July feast is generally dedicated to Our Lady of Mount Carmel while the September feast, beginning in August, brings large numbers of visitors annually to the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn in New York City.

== In biology ==
Rosalia was proposed as the patron saint of evolutionary studies in a paper by G.E. Hutchinson. This was due to a visit he paid to a pool of water downstream from the cave where St. Rosalia&#x27;s remains were found, where he developed ideas based on observations of water boatmen.

== In art ==
Saint Rosalia was an important subject in Italian Renaissance and Baroque painting, particularly in sacre conversazioni (group pictures of saints flanking the Virgin Mary) by artists such as Riccardo Quartararo, Mario di Laurito, Vincenzo La Barbara, and possibly Antonello da Messina.

It was the Flemish master Anthony van Dyck (1599–1637), who was caught up in Palermo during the 1624 plague, who produced the most paintings of her. His depictions a young woman with flowing blonde hair, wearing a Franciscan cowl and reaching down toward the city of Palermo in its peril became the standard iconography of Rosalia from that time onward. Van Dyck&#x27;s series of St. Rosalia paintings have been studied by Gauvin Alexander Bailey and Xavier F. Salomon, both of whom curated or co-curated exhibitions devoted to the theme of Italian art and the plague. In March 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an article about the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x27;s painting of Saint Rosalia by Van Dyck in the context of COVID-19.

Van Dyck also made designs for prints which were engraved by Philips van Mallery for the publication &quot;Vita S. Rosaliae Virginis Panormitanae Pestis Patronæ iconibus expressa&quot;, which was published by Cornelis Galle the Elder in Antwerp in 1629. Only a few copies of the work, which recounts the life of Saint Rosalia, survive.

<text>In computer science, a thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is typically a part of the operating system. In many cases, a thread is a component of a process. 

The multiple threads of a given process may be executed concurrently (via multithreading capabilities), sharing resources such as memory, while different processes do not share these resources. In particular, the threads of a process share its executable code and the values of its dynamically allocated variables and non-thread-local global variables at any given time. 

The implementation of threads and processes differs between operating systems. 

== History ==

Threads made an early appearance under the name of &quot;tasks&quot; in IBM&#x27;s batch processing operating system, OS/360, in 1967. It provided users with three available configurations of the OS/360 control system, of which Multiprogramming with a Variable Number of Tasks (MVT) was one. Saltzer (1966) credits Victor A. Vyssotsky with the term &quot;thread&quot;.

The use of threads in software applications became more common in the early 2000s as CPUs began to utilize multiple cores. Applications wishing to take advantage of multiple cores for performance advantages were required to employ concurrency to utilize the multiple cores.

== Related concepts ==

Scheduling can be done at the kernel level or user level, and multitasking can be done preemptively or cooperatively. This yields a variety of related concepts.

===Processes===

At the kernel level, a &quot;process&quot; contains one or more &quot;kernel threads&quot;, which share the process&#x27;s resources, such as memory and file handles – a process is a unit of resources, while a thread is a unit of scheduling and execution. Kernel scheduling is typically uniformly done preemptively or, less commonly, cooperatively. At the user level a process such as a runtime system can itself schedule multiple threads of execution. If these do not share data, as in Erlang, they are usually analogously called processes, while if they share data they are usually called &quot;(user) threads&quot;, particularly if preemptively scheduled. Cooperatively scheduled user threads are known as &quot;fibers&quot;; different processes may schedule user threads differently. User threads may be executed by kernel threads in various ways (one-to-one, many-to-one, many-to-many). The term &quot;light-weight process&quot; variously refers to user threads or to kernel mechanisms for scheduling user threads onto kernel threads.

A &quot;process&quot; is a &quot;heavyweight&quot; unit of kernel scheduling, as creating, destroying, and switching processes is relatively expensive. Processes own resources allocated by the operating system. Resources include memory (for both code and data), file handles, sockets, device handles, windows, and a process control block. Processes are &quot;isolated&quot; by process isolation, and do not share address spaces or file resources except through explicit methods such as inheriting file handles or shared memory segments, or mapping the same file in a shared way – see interprocess communication. Creating or destroying a process is relatively expensive, as resources must be acquired or released. Processes are typically preemptively multitasked, and process switching is relatively expensive, beyond basic cost of context switching, due to issues such as cache flushing (in particular, process switching changes virtual memory addressing, causing invalidation and thus flushing of an untagged translation lookaside buffer (TLB), notably on x86).

===Kernel threads===

A &quot;kernel thread&quot; is a &quot;lightweight&quot; unit of kernel scheduling. At least one kernel thread exists within each process. If multiple kernel threads exist within a process, then they share the same memory and file resources. Kernel threads are preemptively multitasked if the operating system&#x27;s process scheduler is preemptive. Kernel threads do not own resources except for a stack, a copy of the registers including the program counter, and thread-local storage (if any), and are thus relatively cheap to create and destroy. Thread switching is also relatively cheap: it requires a context switch (saving and restoring registers and stack pointer), but does not change virtual memory and is thus cache-friendly (leaving TLB valid). The kernel can assign one or more software threads to each core in a CPU (it being able to assign itself multiple software threads depending on its support for multithreading), and can swap out threads that get blocked. However, kernel threads take much longer than user threads to be swapped.

===User threads===

Threads are sometimes implemented in userspace libraries, thus called &quot;user threads&quot;. The kernel is unaware of them, so they are managed and scheduled in userspace. Some implementations base their user threads on top of several kernel threads, to benefit from multi-processor machines (M:N model). User threads as implemented by virtual machines are also called green threads.

As user thread implementations are typically entirely in userspace, context switching between user threads within the same process is extremely efficient because it does not require any interaction with the kernel at all: a context switch can be performed by locally saving the CPU registers used by the currently executing user thread or fiber and then loading the registers required by the user thread or fiber to be executed. Since scheduling occurs in userspace, the scheduling policy can be more easily tailored to the requirements of the program&#x27;s workload.

However, the use of blocking system calls in user threads (as opposed to kernel threads) can be problematic. If a user thread or a fiber performs a system call that blocks, the other user threads and fibers in the process are unable to run until the system call returns. A typical example of this problem is when performing I/O: most programs are written to perform I/O synchronously. When an I/O operation is initiated, a system call is made, and does not return until the I/O operation has been completed. In the intervening period, the entire process is &quot;blocked&quot; by the kernel and cannot run, which starves other user threads and fibers in the same process from executing.

A common solution to this problem (used, in particular, by many green threads implementations) is providing an I/O API that implements an interface that blocks the calling thread, rather than the entire process, by using non-blocking I/O internally, and scheduling another user thread or fiber while the I/O operation is in progress. Similar solutions can be provided for other blocking system calls. Alternatively, the program can be written to avoid the use of synchronous I/O or other blocking system calls (in particular, using non-blocking I/O, including lambda continuations and/or async/await primitives).

===Fibers===

Fibers are an even lighter unit of scheduling which are cooperatively scheduled: a running fiber must explicitly &quot;yield&quot; to allow another fiber to run, which makes their implementation much easier than kernel or user threads. A fiber can be scheduled to run in any thread in the same process. This permits applications to gain performance improvements by managing scheduling themselves, instead of relying on the kernel scheduler (which may not be tuned for the application). Some research implementations of the OpenMP parallel programming model implement their tasks through fibers. Closely related to fibers are coroutines, with the distinction being that coroutines are a language-level construct, while fibers are a system-level construct.

===Threads vs processes===
Threads differ from traditional multitasking operating-system processes in several ways:
* processes are typically independent, while threads exist as subsets of a process
* processes carry considerably more state information than threads, whereas multiple threads within a process share process state as well as memory and other resources
* processes have separate address spaces, whereas threads share their address space
* processes interact only through system-provided inter-process communication mechanisms
* context switching between threads in the same process typically occurs faster than context switching between processes

Systems such as Windows NT and OS/2 are said to have &quot;cheap&quot; threads and &quot;expensive&quot; processes; in other operating systems there is not so great a difference except in the cost of an address-space switch, which on some architectures (notably x86) results in a translation lookaside buffer (TLB) flush.

Advantages and disadvantages of threads vs processes include:
* &quot;Lower resource consumption&quot; of threads: using threads, an application can operate using fewer resources than it would need when using multiple processes. 
* &quot;Simplified sharing and communication&quot; of threads: unlike processes, which require a message passing or shared memory mechanism to perform inter-process communication (IPC), threads can communicate through data, code and files they already share.
* &quot;Thread crashes a process&quot;: due to threads sharing the same address space, an illegal operation performed by a thread can crash the entire process; therefore, one misbehaving thread can disrupt the processing of all the other threads in the application.

==Scheduling==
===Preemptive vs cooperative scheduling===
Operating systems schedule threads either preemptively or cooperatively. Multi-user operating systems generally favor preemptive multithreading for its finer-grained control over execution time via context switching. However, preemptive scheduling may context-switch threads at moments unanticipated by programmers, thus causing lock convoy, priority inversion, or other side-effects. In contrast, cooperative multithreading relies on threads to relinquish control of execution, thus ensuring that threads run to completion. This can cause problems if a cooperatively multitasked thread blocks by waiting on a resource or if it starves other threads by not yielding control of execution during intensive computation.

=== Single- vs multi-processor systems ===
Until the early 2000s, most desktop computers had only one single-core CPU, with no support for hardware threads, although threads were still used on such computers because switching between threads was generally still quicker than full-process context switches. In 2002, Intel added support for simultaneous multithreading to the Pentium 4 processor, under the name &quot;hyper-threading&quot;; in 2005, they introduced the dual-core Pentium D processor and AMD introduced the dual-core Athlon 64 X2 processor.

Systems with a single processor generally implement multithreading by time slicing: the central processing unit (CPU) switches between different &quot;software threads&quot;. This context switching usually occurs frequently enough that users perceive the threads or tasks as running in parallel (for popular server/desktop operating systems, maximum time slice of a thread, when other threads are waiting, is often limited to 100–200ms). On a multiprocessor or multi-core system, multiple threads can execute in parallel, with every processor or core executing a separate thread simultaneously; on a processor or core with &quot;hardware threads&quot;, separate software threads can also be executed concurrently by separate hardware threads.

===Threading models===

====1:1 (kernel-level threading)====
Threads created by the user in a 1:1 correspondence with schedulable entities in the kernel are the simplest possible threading implementation. OS/2 and Win32 used this approach from the start, while on Linux the GNU C Library implements this approach (via the NPTL or older LinuxThreads). This approach is also used by Solaris, NetBSD, FreeBSD, macOS, and iOS.

====&quot;M&quot;:1 (user-level threading)====
An &quot;M&quot;:1 model implies that all application-level threads map to one kernel-level scheduled entity; the kernel has no knowledge of the application threads. With this approach, context switching can be done very quickly and, in addition, it can be implemented even on simple kernels which do not support threading. One of the major drawbacks, however, is that it cannot benefit from the hardware acceleration on multithreaded processors or multi-processor computers: there is never more than one thread being scheduled at the same time. For example: If one of the threads needs to execute an I/O request, the whole process is blocked and the threading advantage cannot be used. The GNU Portable Threads uses User-level threading, as does State Threads.

====&quot;M&quot;:&quot;N&quot; (hybrid threading)====
&quot;M&quot;:&quot;N&quot; maps some number of application threads onto some number of kernel entities, or &quot;virtual processors.&quot; This is a compromise between kernel-level (&quot;1:1&quot;) and user-level (&quot;&quot;N&quot;:1&quot;) threading. In general, &quot;&quot;M&quot;:&quot;N&quot;&quot; threading systems are more complex to implement than either kernel or user threads, because changes to both kernel and user-space code are required. In the M:N implementation, the threading library is responsible for scheduling user threads on the available schedulable entities; this makes context switching of threads very fast, as it avoids system calls. However, this increases complexity and the likelihood of priority inversion, as well as suboptimal scheduling without extensive (and expensive) coordination between the userland scheduler and the kernel scheduler.

====Hybrid implementation examples====
* Scheduler activations used by older versions of the NetBSD native POSIX threads library implementation (an &quot;M&quot;:&quot;N&quot; model as opposed to a 1:1 kernel or userspace implementation model)
* Light-weight processes used by older versions of the Solaris operating system
* Marcel from the PM2 project.
* The OS for the Tera-Cray MTA-2
* The Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) for the language Haskell uses lightweight threads which are scheduled on operating system threads.

====History of threading models in Unix systems====
SunOS 4.x implemented &quot;light-weight processes&quot; or LWPs. NetBSD 2.x+, and DragonFly BSD implement LWPs as kernel threads (1:1 model). SunOS 5.2 through SunOS 5.8 as well as NetBSD 2 to NetBSD 4 implemented a two level model, multiplexing one or more user level threads on each kernel thread (M:N model). SunOS 5.9 and later, as well as NetBSD 5 eliminated user threads support, returning to a 1:1 model. FreeBSD 5 implemented M:N model. FreeBSD 6 supported both 1:1 and M:N, users could choose which one should be used with a given program using /etc/libmap.conf. Starting with FreeBSD 7, the 1:1 became the default. FreeBSD 8 no longer supports the M:N model.

==Single-threaded vs multithreaded programs==
In computer programming, &quot;single-threading&quot; is the processing of one instruction at a time. In the formal analysis of the variables&#x27; semantics and process state, the term &quot;single threading&quot; can be used differently to mean &quot;backtracking within a single thread&quot;, which is common in the functional programming community.

Multithreading is mainly found in multitasking operating systems. Multithreading is a widespread programming and execution model that allows multiple threads to exist within the context of one process. These threads share the process&#x27;s resources, but are able to execute independently. The threaded programming model provides developers with a useful abstraction of concurrent execution. Multithreading can also be applied to one process to enable parallel execution on a multiprocessing system.

Multithreading libraries tend to provide a function call to create a new thread, which takes a function as a parameter. A concurrent thread is then created which starts running the passed function and ends when the function returns. The thread libraries also offer data synchronization functions.

===Threads and data synchronization===
Threads in the same process share the same address space. This allows concurrently running code to couple tightly and conveniently exchange data without the overhead or complexity of an IPC. When shared between threads, however, even simple data structures become prone to race conditions if they require more than one CPU instruction to update: two threads may end up attempting to update the data structure at the same time and find it unexpectedly changing underfoot. Bugs caused by race conditions can be very difficult to reproduce and isolate.

To prevent this, threading application programming interfaces (APIs) offer synchronization primitives such as mutexes to lock data structures against concurrent access. On uniprocessor systems, a thread running into a locked mutex must sleep and hence trigger a context switch. On multi-processor systems, the thread may instead poll the mutex in a spinlock. Both of these may sap performance and force processors in symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) systems to contend for the memory bus, especially if the granularity of the locking is too fine.

Other synchronization APIs include condition variables, critical sections, semaphores, and monitors.

===Thread pools===

A popular programming pattern involving threads is that of thread pools where a set number of threads are created at startup that then wait for a task to be assigned. When a new task arrives, it wakes up, completes the task and goes back to waiting. This avoids the relatively expensive thread creation and destruction functions for every task performed and takes thread management out of the application developer&#x27;s hand and leaves it to a library or the operating system that is better suited to optimize thread management.

===Multithreaded programs vs single-threaded programs pros and cons===

Multithreaded applications have the following advantages vs single-threaded ones:
* &quot;Responsiveness&quot;: multithreading can allow an application to remain responsive to input. In a one-thread program, if the main execution thread blocks on a long-running task, the entire application can appear to freeze. By moving such long-running tasks to a &quot;worker thread&quot; that runs concurrently with the main execution thread, it is possible for the application to remain responsive to user input while executing tasks in the background. On the other hand, in most cases multithreading is not the only way to keep a program responsive, with non-blocking I/O and/or Unix signals being available for obtaining similar results.
* &quot;Parallelization&quot;: applications looking to use multicore or multi-CPU systems can use multithreading to split data and tasks into parallel subtasks and let the underlying architecture manage how the threads run, either concurrently on one core or in parallel on multiple cores. GPU computing environments like CUDA and OpenCL use the multithreading model where dozens to hundreds of threads run in parallel across data on a large number of cores. This, in turn, enables better system utilization, and (provided that synchronization costs don&#x27;t eat the benefits up), can provide faster program execution.

Multithreaded applications have the following drawbacks:
* &quot;Synchronization&quot; complexity and related bugs: when using shared resources typical for threaded programs, the programmer must be careful to avoid race conditions and other non-intuitive behaviors. In order for data to be correctly manipulated, threads will often need to rendezvous in time in order to process the data in the correct order. Threads may also require mutually exclusive operations (often implemented using mutexes) to prevent common data from being read or overwritten in one thread while being modified by another. Careless use of such primitives can lead to deadlocks, livelocks or races over resources. As Edward A. Lee has written: &quot;Although threads seem to be a small step from sequential computation, in fact, they represent a huge step. They discard the most essential and appealing properties of sequential computation: understandability, predictability, and determinism. Threads, as a model of computation, are wildly non-deterministic, and the job of the programmer becomes one of pruning that nondeterminism.&quot;
* &quot;Being untestable&quot;. In general, multithreaded programs are non-deterministic, and as a result, are untestable. In other words, a multithreaded program can easily have bugs which never manifest on a test system, manifesting only in production. This can be alleviated by restricting inter-thread communications to certain well-defined patterns (such as message-passing).
* &quot;Synchronization costs&quot;. As thread context switch on modern CPUs can cost up to 1 million CPU cycles, it makes writing efficient multithreading programs difficult. In particular, special attention has to be paid to avoid inter-thread synchronization from being too frequent.

==Programming language support==
Many programming languages support threading in some capacity.

* IBM PL/I(F) included support for multithreading (called &quot;multitasking&quot;) as early as in the late 1960s, and this was continued in the Optimizing Compiler and later versions. The IBM Enterprise PL/I compiler introduced a new model &quot;thread&quot; API. Neither version was part of the PL/I standard.
* Many implementations of C and C++ support threading, and provide access to the native threading APIs of the operating system. A standardized interface for thread implementation is POSIX Threads (Pthreads), which is a set of C-function library calls. OS vendors are free to implement the interface as desired, but the application developer should be able to use the same interface across multiple platforms. Most Unix platforms, including Linux, support Pthreads. Microsoft Windows has its own set of thread functions in the process.h interface for multithreading, like beginthread.
* Some higher level (and usually cross-platform) programming languages, such as Java, Python, and .NET Framework languages, expose threading to developers while abstracting the platform specific differences in threading implementations in the runtime. Several other programming languages and language extensions also try to abstract the concept of concurrency and threading from the developer fully (Cilk, OpenMP, Message Passing Interface (MPI)). Some languages are designed for sequential parallelism instead (especially using GPUs), without requiring concurrency or threads (Ateji PX, CUDA).
* A few interpreted programming languages have implementations (e.g., Ruby MRI for Ruby, CPython for Python) which support threading and concurrency but not parallel execution of threads, due to a global interpreter lock (GIL). The GIL is a mutual exclusion lock held by the interpreter that can prevent the interpreter from simultaneously interpreting the application&#x27;s code on two or more threads at once. This effectively limits the parallelism on multiple core systems. It also limits performance for processor-bound threads (which require the processor), but doesn&#x27;t effect I/O-bound or network-bound ones as much. Other implementations of interpreted programming languages, such as Tcl using the Thread extension, avoid the GIL limit by using an Apartment model where data and code must be explicitly &quot;shared&quot; between threads. In Tcl each thread has one or more interpreters.
* In programming models such as CUDA designed for data parallel computation, an array of threads run the same code in parallel using only its ID to find its data in memory. In essence, the application must be designed so that each thread performs the same operation on different segments of memory so that they can operate in parallel and use the GPU architecture.
* Hardware description languages such as Verilog have a different threading model that supports extremely large numbers of threads (for modeling hardware).

<text>In mathematics, a Clifford algebra is an algebra generated by a vector space with a quadratic form, and is a unital associative algebra with the additional structure of a distinguished subspace. As -algebras, they generalize the real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions and several other hypercomplex number systems. The theory of Clifford algebras is intimately connected with the theory of quadratic forms and orthogonal transformations. Clifford algebras have important applications in a variety of fields including geometry, theoretical physics and digital image processing. They are named after the English mathematician William Kingdon Clifford (1845–1879). 

The most familiar Clifford algebras, the orthogonal Clifford algebras, are also referred to as (&quot;pseudo-&quot;)&quot;Riemannian Clifford algebras&quot;, as distinct from &quot;symplectic Clifford algebras&quot;.

== Introduction and basic properties ==
A Clifford algebra is a unital associative algebra that contains and is generated by a vector space over a field , where is equipped with a quadratic form . The Clifford algebra is the &quot;freest&quot; unital associative algebra generated by subject to the condition
formula_1
where the product on the left is that of the algebra, and the on the right is the algebra&#x27;s multiplicative identity (not to be confused with the multiplicative identity of ). The idea of being the &quot;freest&quot; or &quot;most general&quot; algebra subject to this identity can be formally expressed through the notion of a universal property, as done below.

When is a finite-dimensional real vector space and is nondegenerate, may be identified by the label , indicating that has an orthogonal basis with elements with , with , and where indicates that this is a Clifford algebra over the reals; i.e. coefficients of elements of the algebra are real numbers. This basis may be found by orthogonal diagonalization.

The free algebra generated by may be written as the tensor algebra , that is, the direct sum of the tensor product of copies of over all . Therefore one obtains a Clifford algebra as the quotient of this tensor algebra by the two-sided ideal generated by elements of the form for all elements . The product induced by the tensor product in the quotient algebra is written using juxtaposition (e.g. ). Its associativity follows from the associativity of the tensor product.

The Clifford algebra has a distinguished subspace , being the image of the embedding map. Such a subspace cannot in general be uniquely determined given only a -algebra that is isomorphic to the Clifford algebra.

If is invertible in the ground field , then one can rewrite the fundamental identity above in the form
formula_2
where
formula_3
is the symmetric bilinear form associated with , via the polarization identity.

Quadratic forms and Clifford algebras in characteristic form an exceptional case in this respect. In particular, if it is not true that a quadratic form necessarily or uniquely determines a symmetric bilinear form that satisfies , Many of the statements in this article include the condition that the characteristic is not , and are false if this condition is removed.

=== As a quantization of the exterior algebra ===
Clifford algebras are closely related to exterior algebras. Indeed, if then the Clifford algebra is just the exterior algebra . Whenever is invertible in the ground field , there exists a canonical &quot;linear&quot; isomorphism between and . That is, they are naturally isomorphic as vector spaces, but with different multiplications (in the case of characteristic two, they are still isomorphic as vector spaces, just not naturally). Clifford multiplication together with the distinguished subspace is strictly richer than the exterior product since it makes use of the extra information provided by .

The Clifford algebra is a filtered algebra; the associated graded algebra is the exterior algebra.

More precisely, Clifford algebras may be thought of as &quot;quantizations&quot; (cf. quantum group) of the exterior algebra, in the same way that the Weyl algebra is a quantization of the symmetric algebra.

Weyl algebras and Clifford algebras admit a further structure of a *-algebra, and can be unified as even and odd terms of a superalgebra, as discussed in CCR and CAR algebras.

== Universal property and construction ==
Let be a vector space over a field , and let be a quadratic form on . In most cases of interest the field is either the field of real numbers , or the field of complex numbers , or a finite field.

A Clifford algebra is a pair , where is a unital associative algebra over and is a linear map that satisfies for all in , defined by the following universal property: given any unital associative algebra over and any linear map such that
formula_4
(where denotes the multiplicative identity of ), there is a unique algebra homomorphism such that the following diagram commutes (i.e. such that ):

The quadratic form may be replaced by a (not necessarily symmetric) bilinear form that has the property , in which case an equivalent requirement on is
formula_5

When the characteristic of the field is not , this may be replaced by what is then an equivalent requirement,
formula_6
where the bilinear form may additionally be restricted to being symmetric without loss of generality.

A Clifford algebra as described above always exists and can be constructed as follows: start with the most general algebra that contains , namely the tensor algebra , and then enforce the fundamental identity by taking a suitable quotient. In our case we want to take the two-sided ideal in generated by all elements of the form
formula_7 for all formula_8
and define as the quotient algebra
formula_9

The ring product inherited by this quotient is sometimes referred to as the Clifford product to distinguish it from the exterior product and the scalar product.

It is then straightforward to show that contains and satisfies the above universal property, so that is unique up to a unique isomorphism; thus one speaks of &quot;the&quot; Clifford algebra . It also follows from this construction that is injective. One usually drops the  and considers as a linear subspace of .

The universal characterization of the Clifford algebra shows that the construction of is in nature. Namely, can be considered as a functor from the category of vector spaces with quadratic forms (whose morphisms are linear maps that preserve the quadratic form) to the category of associative algebras. The universal property guarantees that linear maps between vector spaces (that preserve the quadratic form) extend uniquely to algebra homomorphisms between the associated Clifford algebras.

== Basis and dimension ==

Since comes equipped with a quadratic form , in characteristic not equal to there exist bases for that are orthogonal. An orthogonal basis is one such that for a symmetric bilinear form
formula_10 for formula_11, and formula_12

The fundamental Clifford identity implies that for an orthogonal basis
formula_13 for formula_14, and formula_15

This makes manipulation of orthogonal basis vectors quite simple. Given a product formula_16 of &quot;distinct&quot; orthogonal basis vectors of , one can put them into a standard order while including an overall sign determined by the number of pairwise swaps needed to do so (i.e. the signature of the ordering permutation).

If the dimension of over is and is an orthogonal basis of , then is free over with a basis
formula_17

The empty product () is defined as being the multiplicative identity element. For each value of there are  basis elements, so the total dimension of the Clifford algebra is
formula_18

== Examples: real and complex Clifford algebras ==
The most important Clifford algebras are those over real and complex vector spaces equipped with nondegenerate quadratic forms.

Each of the algebras and is isomorphic to or , where is a full matrix ring with entries from , , or . For a complete classification of these algebras see &quot;Classification of Clifford algebras&quot;.

=== Real numbers ===
Clifford algebras are also sometimes referred to as geometric algebras, most often over the real numbers.

Every nondegenerate quadratic form on a finite-dimensional real vector space is equivalent to the standard diagonal form:
formula_19
where is the dimension of the vector space. The pair of integers is called the signature of the quadratic form. The real vector space with this quadratic form is often denoted The Clifford algebra on is denoted The symbol means either or , depending on whether the author prefers positive-definite or negative-definite spaces.

A standard basis for consists of mutually orthogonal vectors, of which square to and of which square to . Of such a basis, the algebra will therefore have vectors that square to and vectors that square to .

A few low-dimensional cases are:
* is naturally isomorphic to since there are no nonzero vectors.
* is a two-dimensional algebra generated by that squares to , and is algebra-isomorphic to , the field of complex numbers.
* is a four-dimensional algebra spanned by . The latter three elements all square to and anticommute, and so the algebra is isomorphic to the quaternions .
* is an 8-dimensional algebra isomorphic to the direct sum , the split-biquaternions.

=== Complex numbers ===
One can also study Clifford algebras on complex vector spaces. Every nondegenerate quadratic form on a complex vector space of dimension is equivalent to the standard diagonal form
formula_20
Thus, for each dimension , up to isomorphism there is only one Clifford algebra of a complex vector space with a nondegenerate quadratic form. We will denote the Clifford algebra on with the standard quadratic form by .

For the first few cases one finds that
* , the complex numbers
* , the bicomplex numbers
* , the biquaternions
where denotes the algebra of matrices over .

== Examples: constructing quaternions and dual quaternions ==
=== Quaternions ===
In this section, Hamilton&#x27;s quaternions are constructed as the even subalgebra of the Clifford algebra .

Let the vector space be real three-dimensional space , and the quadratic form be the usual quadratic form. Then, for in we have the bilinear form (or scalar product)
formula_21
Now introduce the Clifford product of vectors and given by
formula_22

Denote a set of orthogonal unit vectors of as , then the Clifford product yields the relations
formula_23
and
formula_24
The general element of the Clifford algebra is given by
formula_25

The linear combination of the even degree elements of defines the even subalgebra with the general element
formula_26
The basis elements can be identified with the quaternion basis elements as
formula_27
which shows that the even subalgebra is Hamilton&#x27;s real quaternion algebra.

To see this, compute
formula_28
and
formula_29
Finally,
formula_30

=== Dual quaternions ===
In this section, dual quaternions are constructed as the even subalgebra of a Clifford algebra of real four-dimensional space with a degenerate quadratic form.

Let the vector space be real four-dimensional space and let the quadratic form be a degenerate form derived from the Euclidean metric on For in introduce the degenerate bilinear form
formula_31
This degenerate scalar product projects distance measurements in onto the hyperplane.

The Clifford product of vectors and is given by
formula_32
Note the negative sign is introduced to simplify the correspondence with quaternions.

Denote a set of mutually orthogonal unit vectors of as , then the Clifford product yields the relations
formula_33
and
formula_34

The general element of the Clifford algebra has 16 components. The linear combination of the even degree elements defines the even subalgebra with the general element
formula_35

The basis elements can be identified with the quaternion basis elements and the dual unit as
formula_36
This provides the correspondence of with dual quaternion algebra.

To see this, compute
formula_37
and
formula_38
The exchanges of and alternate signs an even number of times, and show the dual unit commutes with the quaternion basis elements .

== Examples: in small dimension ==
Let be any field of characteristic not .

=== Dimension 1 ===
For , if has diagonalization , that is there is a non-zero vector such that , then is algebra-isomorphic to a -algebra generated by an element that satisfies , the quadratic algebra .

In particular, if (that is, is the zero quadratic form) then is algebra-isomorphic to the dual numbers algebra over .

If is a non-zero square in , then .

Otherwise, is isomorphic to the quadratic field extension of .

=== Dimension 2 ===
For , if has diagonalization with non-zero and (which always exists if is non-degenerate), then is isomorphic to a -algebra generated by elements and that satisfies , and .

Thus is isomorphic to the (generalized) quaternion algebra . We retrieve Hamilton&#x27;s quaternions when , since .

As a special case, if some in satisfies , then .

== Properties ==
=== Relation to the exterior algebra ===
Given a vector space , one can construct the exterior algebra , whose definition is independent of any quadratic form on . It turns out that if does not have characteristic then there is a natural isomorphism between and considered as vector spaces (and there exists an isomorphism in characteristic two, which may not be natural). This is an algebra isomorphism if and only if . One can thus consider the Clifford algebra as an enrichment (or more precisely, a quantization, cf. the Introduction) of the exterior algebra on with a multiplication that depends on  (one can still define the exterior product independently of ).

The easiest way to establish the isomorphism is to choose an &quot;orthogonal&quot; basis for and extend it to a basis for as described above. The map is determined by
formula_39
Note that this works only if the basis is orthogonal. One can show that this map is independent of the choice of orthogonal basis and so gives a natural isomorphism.

If the characteristic of is , one can also establish the isomorphism by antisymmetrizing. Define functions by
formula_40
where the sum is taken over the symmetric group on elements, . Since is alternating, it induces a unique linear map . The direct sum of these maps gives a linear map between and . This map can be shown to be a linear isomorphism, and it is natural.

A more sophisticated way to view the relationship is to construct a filtration on . Recall that the tensor algebra has a natural filtration: , where contains sums of tensors with order . Projecting this down to the Clifford algebra gives a filtration on . The associated graded algebra
formula_41
is naturally isomorphic to the exterior algebra . Since the associated graded algebra of a filtered algebra is always isomorphic to the filtered algebra as filtered vector spaces (by choosing complements of in for all ), this provides an isomorphism (although not a natural one) in any characteristic, even two.

=== Grading ===
In the following, assume that the characteristic is not .

Clifford algebras are -graded algebras (also known as superalgebras). Indeed, the linear map on defined by (reflection through the origin) preserves the quadratic form and so by the universal property of Clifford algebras extends to an algebra automorphism
formula_42

Since is an involution (i.e. it squares to the identity) one can decompose into positive and negative eigenspaces of 
formula_43
where 
formula_44

Since is an automorphism it follows that:
formula_45
where the bracketed superscripts are read modulo 2. This gives the structure of a -graded algebra. The subspace forms a subalgebra of , called the &quot;even subalgebra&quot;. The subspace is called the &quot;odd part&quot; of (it is not a subalgebra). -grading plays an important role in the analysis and application of Clifford algebras. The automorphism is called the &quot;main involution&quot; or &quot;grade involution&quot;. Elements that are pure in this -grading are simply said to be even or odd.

&quot;Remark&quot;. The Clifford algebra is not a -graded algebra, but is -filtered, where is the subspace spanned by all products of at most elements of .
formula_46

The &quot;degree&quot; of a Clifford number usually refers to the degree in the -grading.

The even subalgebra of a Clifford algebra is itself isomorphic to a Clifford algebra. If is the orthogonal direct sum of a vector of nonzero norm and a subspace , then is isomorphic to , where is the form restricted to . In particular over the reals this implies that:
formula_47

In the negative-definite case this gives an inclusion , which extends the sequence
Likewise, in the complex case, one can show that the even subalgebra of is isomorphic to .

=== Antiautomorphisms ===
In addition to the automorphism , there are two antiautomorphisms that play an important role in the analysis of Clifford algebras. Recall that the tensor algebra comes with an antiautomorphism that reverses the order in all products of vectors:
formula_48
Since the ideal is invariant under this reversal, this operation descends to an antiautomorphism of called the &quot;transpose&quot; or &quot;reversal&quot; operation, denoted by . The transpose is an antiautomorphism: . The transpose operation makes no use of the -grading so we define a second antiautomorphism by composing and the transpose. We call this operation &quot;Clifford conjugation&quot; denoted formula_49
formula_50
Of the two antiautomorphisms, the transpose is the more fundamental.

Note that all of these operations are involutions. One can show that they act as on elements that are pure in the -grading. In fact, all three operations depend on only the degree modulo . That is, if is pure with degree then
formula_51
where the signs are given by the following table:

=== Clifford scalar product ===
When the characteristic is not , the quadratic form on can be extended to a quadratic form on all of (which we also denoted by ). A basis-independent definition of one such extension is
formula_52
where denotes the scalar part of (the degree- part in the -grading). One can show that
formula_53
where the are elements of – this identity is &quot;not&quot; true for arbitrary elements of .

The associated symmetric bilinear form on is given by
formula_54
One can check that this reduces to the original bilinear form when restricted to . The bilinear form on all of is nondegenerate if and only if it is nondegenerate on .

The operator of left (respectively right) Clifford multiplication by the transpose of an element is the adjoint of left (respectively right) Clifford multiplication by with respect to this inner product. That is,
formula_55
and
formula_56

== Structure of Clifford algebras ==
&quot;In this section we assume that characteristic is not , the vector space is finite-dimensional and that the associated symmetric bilinear form of is nondegenerate.&quot; 

A central simple algebra over is a matrix algebra over a (finite-dimensional) division algebra with center . For example, the central simple algebras over the reals are matrix algebras over either the reals or the quaternions.
* If has even dimension then is a central simple algebra over .
* If has even dimension then the even subalgebra is a central simple algebra over a quadratic extension of or a sum of two isomorphic central simple algebras over .
* If has odd dimension then is a central simple algebra over a quadratic extension of or a sum of two isomorphic central simple algebras over .
* If has odd dimension then the even subalgebra is a central simple algebra over .

The structure of Clifford algebras can be worked out explicitly using the following result. Suppose that has even dimension and a non-singular bilinear form with discriminant , and suppose that is another vector space with a quadratic form. The Clifford algebra of is isomorphic to the tensor product of the Clifford algebras of and , which is the space with its quadratic form multiplied by . Over the reals, this implies in particular that
formula_57
formula_58
formula_59
These formulas can be used to find the structure of all real Clifford algebras and all complex Clifford algebras; see the classification of Clifford algebras.

Notably, the Morita equivalence class of a Clifford algebra (its representation theory: the equivalence class of the category of modules over it) depends on only the signature . This is an algebraic form of Bott periodicity.

== Lipschitz group ==
The class of Lipschitz groups ( Clifford groups or Clifford–Lipschitz groups) was discovered by Rudolf Lipschitz.

In this section we assume that is finite-dimensional and the quadratic form is nondegenerate.

An action on the elements of a Clifford algebra by its group of units may be defined in terms of a twisted conjugation: twisted conjugation by maps , where is the &quot;main involution&quot; defined above.

The Lipschitz group is defined to be the set of invertible elements that &quot;stabilize the set of vectors&quot; under this action, meaning that for all in we have:
formula_60

This formula also defines an action of the Lipschitz group on the vector space that preserves the quadratic form , and so gives a homomorphism from the Lipschitz group to the orthogonal group. The Lipschitz group contains all elements of for which is invertible in , and these act on by the corresponding reflections that take to . (In characteristic these are called orthogonal transvections rather than reflections.)

If is a finite-dimensional real vector space with a non-degenerate quadratic form then the Lipschitz group maps onto the orthogonal group of with respect to the form (by the Cartan–Dieudonné theorem) and the kernel consists of the nonzero elements of the field . This leads to exact sequences
formula_61
formula_62

Over other fields or with indefinite forms, the map is not in general onto, and the failure is captured by the spinor norm.

=== Spinor norm ===
In arbitrary characteristic, the spinor norm is defined on the Lipschitz group by
formula_63
It is a homomorphism from the Lipschitz group to the group of non-zero elements of . It coincides with the quadratic form of when is identified with a subspace of the Clifford algebra. Several authors define the spinor norm slightly differently, so that it differs from the one here by a factor of , , or on . The difference is not very important in characteristic other than 2.

The nonzero elements of have spinor norm in the group ( of squares of nonzero elements of the field . So when is finite-dimensional and non-singular we get an induced map from the orthogonal group of to the group , also called the spinor norm. The spinor norm of the reflection about , for any vector , has image in , and this property uniquely defines it on the orthogonal group. This gives exact sequences:
formula_64

Note that in characteristic the group has just one element.

From the point of view of Galois cohomology of algebraic groups, the spinor norm is a connecting homomorphism on cohomology. Writing for the algebraic group of square roots of 1 (over a field of characteristic not it is roughly the same as a two-element group with trivial Galois action), the short exact sequence
formula_65
yields a long exact sequence on cohomology, which begins
formula_66

The 0th Galois cohomology group of an algebraic group with coefficients in is just the group of -valued points: , and , which recovers the previous sequence
formula_67
where the spinor norm is the connecting homomorphism .

== Spin and pin groups ==
In this section we assume that is finite-dimensional and its bilinear form is non-singular.

The pin group is the subgroup of the Lipschitz group of elements of spinor norm , and similarly the spin group is the subgroup of elements of Dickson invariant in . When the characteristic is not , these are the elements of determinant . The spin group usually has index in the pin group.

Recall from the previous section that there is a homomorphism from the Lipschitz group onto the orthogonal group. We define the special orthogonal group to be the image of . If does not have characteristic this is just the group of elements of the orthogonal group of determinant . If does have characteristic , then all elements of the orthogonal group have determinant , and the special orthogonal group is the set of elements of Dickson invariant .

There is a homomorphism from the pin group to the orthogonal group. The image consists of the elements of spinor norm . The kernel consists of the elements and , and has order unless has characteristic . Similarly there is a homomorphism from the Spin group to the special orthogonal group of .

In the common case when is a positive or negative definite space over the reals, the spin group maps onto the special orthogonal group, and is simply connected when has dimension at least . Further the kernel of this homomorphism consists of and . So in this case the spin group, , is a double cover of . Note, however, that the simple connectedness of the spin group is not true in general: if is for and both at least then the spin group is not simply connected. In this case the algebraic group is simply connected as an algebraic group, even though its group of real valued points is not simply connected. This is a rather subtle point, which completely confused the authors of at least one standard book about spin groups.

== Spinors ==

Clifford algebras , with even, are matrix algebras that have a complex representation of dimension . By restricting to the group we get a complex representation of the Pin group of the same dimension, called the spin representation. If we restrict this to the spin group then it splits as the sum of two &quot;half spin representations&quot; (or &quot;Weyl representations&quot;) of dimension .

If is odd then the Clifford algebra is a sum of two matrix algebras, each of which has a representation of dimension , and these are also both representations of the pin group . On restriction to the spin group these become isomorphic, so the spin group has a complex spinor representation of dimension .

More generally, spinor groups and pin groups over any field have similar representations whose exact structure depends on the structure of the corresponding Clifford algebras: whenever a Clifford algebra has a factor that is a matrix algebra over some division algebra, we get a corresponding representation of the pin and spin groups over that division algebra.
For examples over the reals see the article on spinors.

=== Real spinors ===

To describe the real spin representations, one must know how the spin group sits inside its Clifford algebra. The pin group, is the set of invertible elements in that can be written as a product of unit vectors:
formula_68
Comparing with the above concrete realizations of the Clifford algebras, the pin group corresponds to the products of arbitrarily many reflections: it is a cover of the full orthogonal group . The spin group consists of those elements of that are products of an even number of unit vectors. Thus by the Cartan–Dieudonné theorem Spin is a cover of the group of proper rotations .

Let be the automorphism that is given by the mapping acting on pure vectors. Then in particular, is the subgroup of whose elements are fixed by . Let
formula_69
(These are precisely the elements of even degree in .) Then the spin group lies within .

The irreducible representations of restrict to give representations of the pin group. Conversely, since the pin group is generated by unit vectors, all of its irreducible representation are induced in this manner. Thus the two representations coincide. For the same reasons, the irreducible representations of the spin coincide with the irreducible representations of .

To classify the pin representations, one need only appeal to the classification of Clifford algebras. To find the spin representations (which are representations of the even subalgebra), one can first make use of either of the isomorphisms (see above)
formula_70
formula_71
and realize a spin representation in signature as a pin representation in either signature or .

== Applications ==
=== Differential geometry ===
One of the principal applications of the exterior algebra is in differential geometry where it is used to define the bundle of differential forms on a smooth manifold. In the case of a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold, the tangent spaces come equipped with a natural quadratic form induced by the metric. Thus, one can define a Clifford bundle in analogy with the exterior bundle. This has a number of important applications in Riemannian geometry. Perhaps more important is the link to a spin manifold, its associated spinor bundle and manifolds.

=== Physics ===
Clifford algebras have numerous important applications in physics. Physicists usually consider a Clifford algebra to be an algebra that has a basis that is generated by the matrices , called Dirac matrices, which have the property that
formula_72
where is the matrix of a quadratic form of signature (or corresponding to the two equivalent choices of metric signature). These are exactly the defining relations for the Clifford algebra , whose complexification is , which, by the classification of Clifford algebras, is isomorphic to the algebra of complex matrices . However, it is best to retain the notation , since any transformation that takes the bilinear form to the canonical form is &quot;not&quot; a Lorentz transformation of the underlying spacetime.

The Clifford algebra of spacetime used in physics thus has more structure than . It has in addition a set of preferred transformations – Lorentz transformations. Whether complexification is necessary to begin with depends in part on conventions used and in part on how much one wants to incorporate straightforwardly, but complexification is most often necessary in quantum mechanics where the spin representation of the Lie algebra sitting inside the Clifford algebra conventionally requires a complex Clifford algebra. For reference, the spin Lie algebra is given by
formula_73

This is in the convention, hence fits in .

The Dirac matrices were first written down by Paul Dirac when he was trying to write a relativistic first-order wave equation for the electron, and give an explicit isomorphism from the Clifford algebra to the algebra of complex matrices. The result was used to define the Dirac equation and introduce the Dirac operator. The entire Clifford algebra shows up in quantum field theory in the form of Dirac field bilinears.

The use of Clifford algebras to describe quantum theory has been advanced among others by Mario Schönberg, by David Hestenes in terms of geometric calculus, by David Bohm and Basil Hiley and co-workers in form of a hierarchy of Clifford algebras, and by Elio Conte et al.

=== Computer vision ===
Clifford algebras have been applied in the problem of action recognition and classification in computer vision. Rodriguez et al propose a Clifford embedding to generalize traditional MACH filters to video (3D spatiotemporal volume), and vector-valued data such as optical flow. Vector-valued data is analyzed using the Clifford Fourier Transform. Based on these vectors action filters are synthesized in the Clifford Fourier domain and recognition of actions is performed using Clifford correlation. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the Clifford embedding by recognizing actions typically performed in classic feature films and sports broadcast television.

== Generalizations ==
* While this article focuses on a Clifford algebra of a vector space over a field, the definition extends without change to a module over any unital, associative, commutative ring.
* Clifford algebras may be generalized to a form of degree higher than quadratic over a vector space.

<text>The Kyzylkum Desert (, قِیزِیل‌قُوم; , قىزىلقۇم) is the 15th largest desert in the world. Its name means &quot;Red Sand&quot; in Turkic languages. It is located in Central Asia, in the land between the confluent rivers Amu Darya and Syr Darya, a region historically known as Transoxania. Today it is divided among Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. It covers about .

==Geography==

Kyzylkum is mainly located in Uzbekistan. Its territory consists mainly of an extensive plain at an altitude up to above sea level, with a number of depressions and highlands (Sultanuizdag, Bukantau). Most of the area is covered with dunes (barchans); in the northwest large areas are covered with takirs (clay coatings); there are also some oases. There are agricultural settlements along the rivers and in the oases. Temperatures can be very high during the summer months, from mid-May to mid-September. Kerki, one extreme inland city located on the banks of the Amu Darya River, recorded in July 1983.

==Fauna==

Desert fauna include the Russian tortoise (&quot;Testudo horsfieldii&quot;) and a large lizard known as the Transcaspian or desert monitor (&quot;Varanus griseus&quot;), which can reach lengths of . The saiga antelope (&quot;Saiga tatarica&quot;) also occasionally migrates through the northern part of the desert.

Kyzylkum Nature Reserve in Bukhara Region was established in 1971. The area of the reserve amounts to and it is located on flood-land (tugai) drained by the Amudarya close to the settlement Dargan Ata. Fauna include: Bactrian deer (&quot;Cervus elaphus bactrianus&quot;), wild boar (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;), common pheasant (&quot;Phasianus colchicus&quot;), golden eagle (&quot;Aquila chrysaetus&quot;).

Djeyran Reserve is located south of Bukhara. The total area of this reserve is . It is a breeding centre for rare species such as goitered gazelle (&quot;Gazella subgutturosa&quot;), Przewalski&#x27;s horse (&quot;Equus ferus przewalskii&quot;), Turkmenian kulan (&quot;Equus hemionus kulan&quot;) and MacQueen&#x27;s bustard (&quot;Chlamydotis macqueenii&quot;). The reserve was founded in 1977 on the enclosed area in .

==Paleontology==
The Kyzylkum Desert has exposed rock formations that have yielded a number of fossils. Of particular interest is the Bissekty Formation of Uzbekistan, from the early Late Cretaceous, which has produced several species of early birds: &quot;Incolornis martini&quot;, &quot;Explorornis walkeri&quot;, &quot;Kizylkumavis cretacea&quot;, &quot;Kuszholia mengi&quot;, &quot;Lenesornis kaskarovi&quot;, &quot;Sazavis prisca&quot;, &quot;Zhyraornis kaskarovi&quot; and &quot;Z. logunovi&quot; are recognized as valid species. Tyrannosaurid, therizinosaurid, ornithomimosaur, oviraptorosaurian, troodontid, ankylosaur, hadrosaur, and ceratopsian dinosaurs are also known from this rock unit. Other fossils from the Cretaceous rocks of the Kyzylkum include tree trunks, pelecypods, beetles, sharks, rays, bony fish, frogs, salamanders, turtles, crocodylomorphs, pterosaurs, and a varied fauna of small early mammals. Paleontologists that have worked in this area include J. David Archibald, Alexander Averianov, Sergei Kurzanov, Lev Nesov, Anatoly Riabinin, Anatoly Rozhdestvensky, and Hans-Dieter Sues.

==Economy==

The local population uses the large spaces of the Kyzylkum Desert as a pasture for livestock (mostly sheep, Bactrian camels and dromedaries).

The desert is well known for its deposits of gold, uranium, copper, aluminium and silver, natural gas and oil. The development of the most famous gold-field at Muruntau began in the early 1970s. The centres for the mining and smelting industry at the region are Navoi, Zarafshan, Uchkuduk. The major industrial enterprises are: НГМК (Navoi Mining and Smelting Complex) and the Uzbek U.S.A. Joint Venture &quot;Zarafshan-Newmont&quot;. The centres of the gas-production industry are Gazli and Mubarek.

<doc id="45307" wikidata="Q3537671" url="?curid=45307" title="Atomic electron transition">
<text>In atomic physics and chemistry, an atomic electron transition (also called an atomic transition, quantum jump, or quantum leap) is an electron changing from one energy level to another within an atom or artificial atom. The time scale of a quantum jump has not been measured experimentally. However, the Franck–Condon principle binds the upper limit of this parameter to the order of attoseconds.

Electrons can &quot;relax&quot; into states of lower energy by emitting electromagnetic radiation in the form of a photon. Electrons can also absorb passing photons, which &quot;excites&quot; the electron into a state of higher energy. The larger the energy separation between the electron&#x27;s initial and final state, the shorter the photons&#x27; wavelength.

== History ==
Danish physicist Niels Bohr first theorized that electrons can perform quantum jumps in 1913. Soon after, James Franck and Gustav Ludwig Hertz proved experimentally that atoms have quantized energy states.

The observability of quantum jumps was predicted by Hans Dehmelt in 1975, and they were first observed using trapped ions of barium at University of Hamburg and mercury at NIST in 1986.

== Theory ==
An atom interacts with the oscillating electric field:
_\mathrm{rad} )&lt;/math&gt;|}}
with amplitude formula_1, angular frequency formula_2, and polarization vector formula_3. Note that the actual phase is formula_4. However, in many cases, the variation of formula_5 is small over the atom (or equivalently, the radiation wavelength is much greater than the size of an atom) and this term can be ignored. This is called the dipole approximation. The atom can also interact with the oscillating magnetic field produced by the radiation, although much more weakly.

The Hamiltonian for this interaction, analogous to the energy of a classical dipole in an electric field, is formula_6. The stimulated transition rate can be calculated using time-dependent perturbation theory; however, the result can be summarized using Fermi&#x27;s golden rule:
formula_7
The dipole matrix element can be decomposed into the product of the radial integral and the angular integral. The angular integral is zero unless the selection rules for the atomic transition are satisfied.

== Recent discoveries ==
In 2019, it was demonstrated in an experiment with a superconducting artificial atom consisting of two strongly-hybridized transmon qubits placed inside a readout resonator cavity at 15 mK, that the evolution of some jumps is continuous, coherent, deterministic, and reversible. On the other hand, other quantum jumps are inherently unpredictable.

<text>The Qattara Depression () is a depression in northwestern Egypt, specifically in the Matruh Governorate. The depression is part of the Western Desert of Egypt. 
The Qattara Depression lies below sea level, and its bottom is covered with salt pans, sand dunes, and salt marshes. The depression extends between the latitudes of 28°35&#x27; and 30°25&#x27; north and the longitudes of 26°20&#x27; and 29°02&#x27; east.

The Qattara Depression was created by the interplay of salt weathering and wind erosion. Some west of the depression lie the oases of Siwa in Egypt and Jaghbub in Libya in smaller but similar depressions.

The Qattara Depression contains the second lowest point in Africa at an elevation of below sea level, the lowest point being Lake Assal in Djibouti. The depression covers about , a size comparable with Lake Ontario or twice as large as Lebanon. Due to its size and proximity to the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, studies have been made proposing to flood the area for various usages, such as the potential to generate hydroelectricity there.

==Geography==
The Qattara Depression has the shape of a teardrop, with its point facing east and the broad deep area facing southwest. The northern side of the depression is characterised by steep escarpments up to high, marking the edge of the adjacent El Diffa plateau. To the south the depression slopes gently up to the Great Sand Sea.

Within the Depression are salt marshes, under the northwestern and northern escarpment edges, and extensive dry lake beds that flood occasionally. The marshes occupy approximately , although wind-blown sands are encroaching in some areas. About a quarter of the region is occupied by dry lakes composed of hard crust and sticky mud, and occasionally filled with water.

The depression was initiated by either wind or fluvial erosion in the late Neogene, but during the Quaternary Period the dominant mechanism was a combination of salt weathering and wind erosion working together. First, the salts break up the depression floor, then the wind blows away the resulting sands. This process is less effective in the eastern part of the depression, due to lower salinity groundwater.

==Ecology==


Groves of umbrella thorn acacia (&quot;Vachellia tortilis&quot;), growing in shallow sandy depressions, and &quot;Phragmites&quot; swamps represent the only permanent vegetation. The acacia groves vary widely in biodiversity and rely on runoff from rainfall and groundwater to survive. The Moghra Oasis in the northeastern part of the Depression has a brackish lake and a &quot;Phragmites&quot; swamp.

The southwestern corner of the depression is part of the Siwa Protected Area which protects the wild oasis in and around the Siwa Oasis.

The Depression is an important habitat for the cheetah, with the largest number of recent sightings being in areas in the northern, western and northwestern part of the Qattara Depression, including the highly isolated, wild oases of Ain EI Qattara and Ein EI Ghazzalat and numerous acacia groves both inside and outside the depression.

Gazelles (&quot;Gazella dorcas&quot; and &quot;Gazella leptoceros&quot;) also inhabit the Qattara Depression, being an important food source for the cheetah. The largest gazelle population exists in the southwestern part of the Qattara Depression within a vast area of wetlands and soft sand. The area of , includes the wild oases of Hatiyat Tabaghbagh and Hatiyat Umm Kitabain, and is a mosaic of lakes, salt marshes, scrubland, wild palm groves and &quot;Desmostachya bipinnata&quot; grassland.

Other common fauna include the Cape hare (&quot;Lepus capensis&quot;), Egyptian jackal (&quot;Canis aureus hupstar&quot;), sand fox (&quot;Vulpes rueppelli&quot;) and more rarely the fennec fox (&quot;Vulpes zerda&quot;). Barbary sheep (&quot;Ammotragus lervia&quot;) were once common here but now they are few in number.

Extinct species from the area include the scimitar oryx (&quot;Oryx dammah&quot;), addax (&quot;Addax nasomaculatus&quot;) and bubal hartebeest (&quot;Alcelaphus buselaphus&quot;). Also the &quot;Droseridites baculatus&quot;, an extinct plant known only from fossils of its pollen, was found at the Ghazalat-1 Well.

==Climate==

The climate of the Qattara Depression is highly with annual precipitation between on the northern rim to less than in the south of the depression. The average daily temperature varies between during summer and winter months. The prevailing wind forms a largely bimodal regime with most wind coming from north easterly and westerly directions. This causes the linear dune formations in the Western desert between the Qattara Depression and the Nile valley. Wind speeds peak in March at and minimal in December at .
The average wind speed is about . Several days each year in the months March to May khamsin winds blow in from the south and bring extremely high temperatures as well as sand and dust with them.

==Land use==
There is one permanent settlement in the Qattara Depression, the Qara Oasis. The oasis is located in the westernmost part of the depression and is inhabited by about 300 people. The Depression is also inhabited by the nomadic Bedouin people and their flocks, with the uninhabited Moghra Oasis being important in times of water scarcity during the dry seasons.

The Qattara Depression contains many oil concessions, and several operational oil fields. The drilling companies include Royal Dutch Shell and the Apache Corporation.

==History==

=== Measurement ===
The elevation of the depression was first measured in 1917 by an officer of the British Army leading a light car patrol into the region. The officer took readings of the height of the terrain with an aneroid barometer on behalf of John Ball, who later would also publish on the region. He discovered that the spring Ain EI Qattara lay about below sea level. Because the barometer got lost and the readings were so unexpected, this find had to be verified. During 1924–25, Ball again organised a survey party, this time with the sole purpose to triangulate the elevation on a westerly line from Wadi El Natrun. The survey was led by G.F. Walpole who had already distinguished himself by triangulating the terrain across from the Nile to Siwa via Bahariya. He confirmed the earlier readings and proved the presence of a huge area below sea level, with places as deep as below sea level.

Knowledge about the geology of the Qattara Depression was greatly extended by Ralph Alger Bagnold, a British military commander and explorer, through numerous journeys in the 1920s and 1930s. Most notable was his 1927 journey during which he crossed the depression east to west and visited the oases of Qara and Siwa. Many of these trips used motor vehicles (Ford Model-Ts) which used special techniques for driving in desert conditions. These techniques were an important asset of the Long Range Desert Group which Bagnold founded in 1940.

After the discovery of the depression, Ball published the triangulation findings about the region in October 1927 in &quot;The Geographical Journal&quot;. He also gave the region its name &quot;Qattara&quot; after the spring Ain EI Qattara where the first readings were taken. The name literally means &quot;dripping&quot; in Arabic. Six years later in 1933, Ball was the first to publish a proposal for flooding the region to generate hydroelectric power in his article &quot;The Qattara Depression of the Libyan Desert and the possibility of its utilisation for power-production&quot;.

===World War II===
During World War II, the depression&#x27;s presence shaped the First and Second Battles of El Alamein. It was considered impassable by tanks and most other military vehicles because of features such as salt lakes, high cliffs and/or escarpments, and fech fech (very fine powdered sand). The cliffs in particular acted as an edge of the El Alamein battlefield, which meant the British Empire&#x27;s forces could not be outflanked to the south. Both Axis and Allied forces built their defences in a line from the Mediterranean Sea to the Qattara Depression. These defences became known as the Devil&#x27;s gardens, and they are for the most part still there, especially the extensive minefields.

No large army units entered the Depression, although German Afrika Korps patrols and the British Long Range Desert Group did operate in the area, since these small units had considerable experience in desert travel. The RAF&#x27;s repair and salvage units (e.g. 58 RSU) used a route through the depression to salvage or recover aircraft that had landed or crashed in the Western desert away from the coastal plain.

The RSUs included six-wheel-drive trucks, Coles cranes, and large trailers, and were particularly active from mid-1941 when Air Vice-Marshal G.G. Dawson arrived in Egypt to address the lack of serviceable aircraft.

A German communications officer stationed in the depression was cited by Gordon Welchman as being unintentionally helpful in the breaking of the Enigma machine code, due to his regular transmissions stating there was &quot;nothing to report&quot;.

==Qattara Depression Project==
The large size of the Qattara Depression and the fact that it falls to a depth of below mean sea level has led to several proposals to create a massive hydroelectric power project in northern Egypt rivalling that of the Aswan High Dam. This project is known as the Qattara Depression Project. The proposals call for a large canal or tunnel being excavated from the Qattara due north of depending on the route chosen to the Mediterranean Sea to bring seawater into the area.

An alternative plan involved running a pipeline northeast to the freshwater Nile River at Rosetta. Water would flow into a series of water penstocks which would generate electricity by releasing the water at below sea level. Because the Qattara Depression is in a very hot dry region with very little cloud cover, the water released at the level would spread out from the release point across the basin and evaporate from solar influx. Because of evaporation, more water can flow into the depression, thus forming a continual source of power. Eventually this would result in a hypersaline lake or a salt pan as the water would evaporate and leave behind the salt that it contained.

Plans to use the Qattara Depression for the generation of electricity date back to 1912 from Berlin geographer Albrecht Penck. The subject was discussed in more detail by Dr. John Ball in 1927, who estimated a hydroelectric potential of 125 to 200 megawatts. In 1957, the American Central Intelligence Agency proposed to President Dwight Eisenhower that peace in the Middle East could be achieved by flooding the Qattara Depression. The resulting lagoon, according to the CIA, would have four benefits:

*It would be spectacular and peaceful.
*It would materially alter the climate in adjacent areas.
*It would provide work during construction and living areas after completion.
*It would get Egyptian president Gamel Abdel Nasser&#x27;s &quot;mind on other matters&quot; because &quot;he need[ed] some way to get off the Soviet hook&quot;

In the 1970s and early 1980s, several proposals to flood the area were made by Friedrich Bassler and the &quot;Joint Venture Qattara&quot;, a group of mainly German companies. They wanted to make use of peaceful nuclear explosions to construct a tunnel, drastically reducing construction costs compared to conventional methods. This project proposed to use 213 H-bombs, with yields of one to 1.5 megatons, detonated at depths of . That fit within the Atoms for Peace program proposed by US President Dwight Eisenhower in 1953. The Egyptian government turned down the idea.

Planning experts and scientists intermittently put forward potentially viable options, whether of a tunnel or canal, as an economic, ecological, and energy solution in Egypt, often coupled with the idea of new settlements.

<text>The Cultural Revolution, formally known as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, was a sociopolitical movement in the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). It was launched by Mao Zedong in 1966 and lasted until 1976. Its stated goal was to preserve Chinese socialism by purging remnants of capitalist and traditional elements from Chinese society.

In May 1966, with the help of the Cultural Revolution Group, Mao launched the Revolution and said that bourgeois elements had infiltrated the government and society with the aim of restoring capitalism. Mao called on young people to bombard the headquarters, and proclaimed that &quot;to rebel is justified&quot;. Mass upheaval began in Beijing with Red August in 1966. Many young people, mainly students, responded by forming cadres of Red Guards throughout the country. &quot;Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung&quot; became revered within his cult of personality. In 1967, emboldened radicals began seizing power from local governments and party branches, establishing new revolutionary committees in their place while smashing public security, procuratorate and judicial systems. These committees often split into rival factions, precipitating armed clashes among the radicals. After the fall of Lin Biao in 1971, the Gang of Four became influential in 1972, and the Revolution continued until Mao&#x27;s death in 1976, soon followed by the arrest of the Gang of Four.

The Cultural Revolution was characterized by violence and chaos across Chinese society. Estimates of the death toll vary widely, typically ranging from 1–2 million, including a massacre in Guangxi that included acts of cannibalism, as well as massacres in Beijing, Inner Mongolia, Guangdong, Yunnan, Hunan. Red Guards sought to destroy the Four Olds (old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits), which often took the form of destroying historical artifacts, cultural and religious sites. Tens of millions were persecuted, including senior officials such as Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping and Peng Dehuai; millions were persecuted for being members of the Five Black Categories, with intellectuals and scientists labelled as the Stinking Old Ninth. The country&#x27;s schools and universities were closed, and the National College Entrance Examinations were cancelled. Over 10 million youth from urban areas were relocated under the Down to the Countryside Movement.

In December 1978, Deng Xiaoping became the new paramount leader of China, replacing Mao&#x27;s successor Hua Guofeng. Deng and his allies introduced the &quot;Boluan Fanzheng&quot; program and initiated economic reforms, which, together with the New Enlightenment movement, gradually dismantled the ideology of Cultural Revolution. In 1981, the Communist Party publicly acknowledged numerous failures of the Cultural Revolution, declaring it &quot;responsible for the most severe setback and the heaviest losses suffered by the people, the country, and the party since the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic.&quot; Given its broad scope and social impact, memories and perspectives of the Cultural Revolution are varied and complex in contemporary China. It is often referred to as the &quot;ten years of chaos&quot; () or &quot;ten years of havoc&quot; ().

== Etymology ==
The terminology of cultural revolution appeared in communist party discourses and newspapers prior to the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. During this period, the term was used interchangeably with &quot;cultural construction&quot; and referred to eliminating illiteracy in order to widen public participation in civic matters. This usage of &quot;cultural revolution&quot; continued through the 1950s and into the 1960s, and often involved drawing parallels to the May Fourth Movement or the Soviet cultural revolution of 1928–1931.

==Background==

===Creation of the People&#x27;s Republic===
On 1 October 1949, Mao Zedong declared the People&#x27;s Republic of China, symbolically bringing the decades-long Chinese Civil War to a close. Remaining Republican forces fled to Taiwan and continued to resist the People&#x27;s Republic in various ways. Many soldiers of the Chinese Republicans were left in mainland China, and Mao Zedong launched the Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries to eliminate these soldiers left behind, as well as elements of Chinese society viewed as potentially dangerous to Mao&#x27;s new government.

===Great Leap Forward===

The Great Leap Forward, similar to the Five-year plans of the Soviet Union, was Mao Zedong&#x27;s proposal to make the newly created People&#x27;s Republic of China an industrial superpower. Beginning in 1958, the Great Leap Forward did produce, at least on the surface, incredible industrialization, but also caused the Great Chinese Famine, while still falling short of projected goals. In early 1962, at CCP&#x27;s Seven Thousand Cadres Conference, Mao made self-criticism, after which he took a semi-retired role, leaving future responsibilities to Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping.

===Impact of international tensions and anti-revisionism===

In the early 1950s, the PRC and the Soviet Union (USSR) were the world&#x27;s two largest communist states. Although initially they were mutually supportive, disagreements arose after Nikita Khrushchev took power in the USSR. In 1956, Khrushchev denounced his predecessor Josef Stalin and his policies, and began implementing economic reforms. Mao and many other CCP members opposed these changes, believing that they would damage the worldwide communist movement.

Mao believed that Khrushchev was a revisionist, altering Marxist–Leninist concepts, which Mao claimed would give capitalists control of the USSR. Relations soured. The USSR refused to support China&#x27;s case for joining the United Nations and reneged on its pledge to supply China with a nuclear weapon.

Mao denounced revisionism in April 1960. Without pointing at the USSR, Mao criticized its Balkan ally, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. In turn, the USSR criticized China&#x27;s Balkan ally, the Party of Labour of Albania. In 1963, CCP began to denounce the USSR, publishing nine polemics.

Other Soviet actions increased concerns about potential fifth columnists. As a result of the tensions following the Sino-Soviet split, Soviet leaders authorized radio broadcasts into China stating that the Soviet Union would assist &quot;genuine communists&quot; who overthrew Mao and his &quot;erroneous course&quot;. Chinese leadership also feared the increasing military conflict between the United States and North Vietnam, concerned that China&#x27;s support would lead to the United States to seek out potential Chinese assets.

=== Socialist Education Movement and &quot;Hai Rui Dismissed from Office&quot; ===


In 1963, Mao launched the Socialist Education Movement. Mao set the scene by &quot;cleansing&quot; powerful Beijing officials of questionable loyalty. His approach was executed via newspaper articles, internal meetings, and by his network of political allies.

In late 1959, historian and deputy mayor of Beijing Wu Han published a historical drama entitled &quot;Hai Rui Dismissed from Office&quot;. In the play, an honest civil servant, Hai Rui, is dismissed by a corrupt emperor. While Mao initially praised the play, in February 1965, he secretly commissioned Jiang Qing and Yao Wenyuan to publish an article criticizing it. Yao described the play as an allegory attacking Mao; flagging Mao as the emperor, and Peng Dehuai, who had previously questioned Mao during the Lushan Conference, as the honest civil servant.

Yao&#x27;s article put Beijing mayor Peng Zhen on the defensive. Peng, Wu Han&#x27;s direct superior, was the head of the Five Man Group, a committee commissioned by Mao to study the potential for a cultural revolution. Peng Zhen, aware that he would be implicated if Wu indeed wrote an &quot;anti-Mao&quot; play, wished to contain Yao&#x27;s influence. Yao&#x27;s article was initially published only in select local newspapers. Peng forbade its publication in the nationally distributed &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; and other major newspapers under his control, and not pay heed to Yao&#x27;s petty politics. While the &quot;literary battle&quot; against Peng raged, Mao fired Yang Shangkun—director of the party&#x27;s General Office, an organ that controlled internal communications—making unsubstantiated charges. He installed loyalist Wang Dongxing, head of Mao&#x27;s security detail. Yang&#x27;s dismissal likely emboldened Mao&#x27;s allies to move against their factional rivals.

On 12 February 1966, the &quot;Five Man Group&quot; issued a report known as the &quot;February Outline&quot;. The &quot;Outline&quot; as sanctioned by the party center defined &quot;Hai Rui&quot; as a constructive &quot;academic&quot; discussion and aimed to distance Peng Zhen formally from any &quot;political&quot; implications. However, Jiang Qing and Yao Wenyuan continued their denunciations. Meanwhile, Mao sacked Propaganda Department director Lu Dingyi, a Peng ally.

Lu&#x27;s removal gave Maoists unrestricted access to the press. Mao delivered his final blow to Peng at a high-profile Politburo meeting through loyalists Kang Sheng and Chen Boda. They accused Peng of opposing Mao, labeled the &quot;February Outline&quot; &quot;evidence of Peng Zhen&#x27;s revisionism&quot;, and grouped him with three other disgraced officials as part of the &quot;Peng-Luo-Lu-Yang Anti-Party Clique&quot;. On 16 May, the Politburo formalized the decisions by releasing an official document condemning Peng and his &quot;anti-party allies&quot; in the strongest terms, disbanding his &quot;Five Man Group&quot;, and replacing it with the Maoist Cultural Revolution Group (CRG).

== 1966: Outbreak ==

The Cultural Revolution can be divided into two main periods:

* spring 1966 to summer 1968 (when most of the key events took place)
* a tailing period that lasted until fall 1976

The early phase was characterized by mass movement and political pluralization. Virtually anyone could create a political organization, even without party approval. Known as Red Guards, these organizations originally arose in schools and universities and later in factories and other institutions. After 1968, most of these organizations ceased to exist, although their legacies were a topic of controversy later.

=== Notification ===
In May 1966, an expanded session of the Politburo was called in Beijing. The conference was laden with Maoist political rhetoric on class struggle and filled with meticulously prepared &#x27;indictments&#x27; of recently ousted leaders such as Peng Zhen and Luo Ruiqing. One of these documents, distributed on 16 May, was prepared with Mao&#x27;s personal supervision and was particularly damning:

Those representatives of the bourgeoisie who have sneaked into the Party, the government, the army, and various spheres of culture are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once conditions are ripe, they will seize political power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Some of them we have already seen through; others we have not. Some are still trusted by us and are being trained as our successors, persons like Khrushchev for example, who are still nestling beside us.

Later known as the &quot;16 May Notification&quot;, this document summarized Mao&#x27;s ideological justification for CR. Initially kept secret, distributed only among high-ranking party members, it was later declassified and published in &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; on 17 May 1967. Effectively it implied that enemies of the Communist cause could be found within the Party: class enemies who &quot;wave the red flag to oppose the red flag.&quot; The only way to identify these people was through &quot;the telescope and microscope of Mao Zedong Thought.&quot; While the party leadership was relatively united in approving Mao&#x27;s agenda, many Politburo members were not enthusiastic, or simply confused about the direction. The charges against party leaders such as Peng disturbed China&#x27;s intellectual community and the eight non-Communist parties.

=== Mass rallies (May–June) ===

After the purge of Peng Zhen, the Beijing Party Committee effectively ceased to function, paving the way for disorder in the capital. On 25 May, under the guidance of —wife of Mao loyalist Kang Sheng—Nie Yuanzi, a philosophy lecturer at Peking University, authored a big-character poster along with other leftists and posted it to a public bulletin. Nie attacked the university&#x27;s party administration and its leader Lu Ping. Nie insinuated that the university leadership, much like Peng, were trying to contain revolutionary fervor in a &quot;sinister&quot; attempt to oppose the party and advance revisionism.

Mao promptly endorsed Nie&#x27;s poster as &quot;the first Marxist big-character poster in China&quot;. Approved by Mao, the poster rippled across educational institutions. Students began to revolt against their school&#x27;s party establishments. Classes were cancelled in Beijing primary and secondary schools, followed by a decision on 13 June to expand the class suspension nationwide. By early June, throngs of young demonstrators lined the capital&#x27;s major thoroughfares holding giant portraits of Mao, beating drums, and shouting slogans.

When the dismissal of Peng and the municipal party leadership became public in early June, confusion was widespread. The public and foreign missions were kept in the dark on the reason for Peng&#x27;s ousting. Top Party leadership was caught off guard by the sudden protest wave and struggled with how to respond. After seeking Mao&#x27;s guidance in Hangzhou, Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping decided to send in &#x27;work teams&#x27;—effectively &#x27;ideological guidance&#x27; squads of cadres—to the city&#x27;s schools and &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; to restore some semblance of order and re-establish party control.

The work teams had a poor understanding of student sentiment. Unlike the political movement of the 1950s that squarely targeted intellectuals, the new movement was focused on established party cadres, many of whom were part of the work teams. As a result, the work teams came under increasing suspicion as thwarting revolutionary fervor. Party leadership subsequently became divided over whether or not work teams should continue. Liu Shaoqi insisted on continuing work-team involvement and suppressing the movement&#x27;s most radical elements, fearing that the movement would spin out of control.

===&quot;Bombard the Headquarters&quot; (July)===
In July, Mao, in Wuhan, crossed the Yangtze River, showing his vigor. He then returned from Wuhan to Beijing and criticized party leadership for its handling of the work-teams issue. Mao accused the work teams of undermining the student movement, calling for their full withdrawal on 24 July. Several days later a rally was held at the Great Hall of the People to announce the decision and reveal the tone of the movement to teachers and students. At the rally, Party leaders encouraged the masses to &#x27;not be afraid&#x27; and take charge of the movement, free of Party interference.

The work-teams issue marked a decisive defeat for Liu; it also signaled that disagreement over how to handle the CR&#x27;s unfolding events would irreversibly split Mao from the party leadership. On 1 August, the Eleventh Plenum of the 8th Central Committee was convened to advance Mao&#x27;s radical agenda. At the plenum, Mao showed disdain for Liu, repeatedly interrupting him as he delivered his opening day speech.

On 28 July, Red Guard representatives wrote to Mao, calling for rebellion and upheaval to safeguard the revolution. Mao then responded to the letters by writing his own big-character poster entitled &quot;Bombard the Headquarters&quot;, rallying people to target the &quot;command centre (i.e., Headquarters) of counterrevolution.&quot; Mao wrote that despite having undergone a communist revolution, a &quot;bourgeois&quot; elite was still thriving in &quot;positions of authority&quot; in the government and Party.

This statement has been interpreted as a direct indictment of the party establishment under Liu and Deng—the purported &quot;bourgeois headquarters&quot; of China. The personnel changes at the Plenum reflected a radical re-design of the party hierarchy. Liu and Deng kept their seats on the Politburo Standing Committee, but were sidelined from day-to-day party affairs. Lin Biao was elevated to become the CCP&#x27;s number-two; Liu&#x27;s rank went from second to eighth and was no longer Mao&#x27;s heir apparent.
Along with the top leadership losing power the entire national Party bureaucracy was purged. The extensive Organization Department, in charge of party personnel, virtually ceased to exist. The top officials in the Propaganda Department were sacked, with many of its functions folded into the CRG.

=== Red August and the Sixteen Points ===

&quot;Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung&quot; led the Red Guards to commit to their objective as China&#x27;s future. By December 1967, 350 million copies had been printed.

During the Red August of Beijing, on 8 August 1966, the party&#x27;s General Committee passed its &quot;Decision Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution,&quot; later to be known as the &quot;Sixteen Points&quot;. This decision defined the Cultural Revolution as &quot;a great revolution that touches people to their very souls and constitutes a new stage in the development of the socialist revolution in our country:&quot;

Although the bourgeoisie has been overthrown, it is still trying to use the old ideas, culture, customs and habits of the exploiting classes to corrupt the masses, capture their minds and endeavour to stage a comeback. The proletariat must do the exact opposite: it must meet head-on every challenge of the bourgeoisie ... to change the mental outlook of the whole of society. At present, our objective is to struggle against and overthrow those persons in authority who are taking the capitalist road, to criticize and repudiate the reactionary bourgeois academic &quot;authorities&quot; and the ideology of the bourgeoisie and all other exploiting classes and to transform education, literature and art and all other parts of the superstructure not in correspondence with the socialist economic base, so as to facilitate the consolidation and development of the socialist system.
The implications of the Sixteen Points were far-reaching. It elevated what was previously a student movement to a nationwide mass campaign that would galvanize workers, farmers, soldiers and lower-level party functionaries to rise, challenge authority, and re-shape the superstructure of society.
On 18 August in Beijing, over a million Red Guards from across the country gathered in and around Tiananmen Square for an audience with the chairman. Mao mingled with Red Guards and encouraged them, donning a Red Guard armband. Lin also took centre stage, denouncing perceived enemies in society that were impeding the &quot;progress of the revolution&quot;. Subsequently, violence escalated in Beijing and quickly spread. The 18 August rally was filmed and shown to approximately 100 million people in its first month of release.

On 22 August, a central directive was issued to prevent police intervention in Red Guard activities, and those in the police force who defied this notice were labeled counter-revolutionaries. Central officials lifted restraints on violent behavior. Xie Fuzhi, the national police chief, often pardoned Red Guards for their &quot;crimes&quot;.

The campaign included incidents of torture, murder, and public humiliation. Many people who were indicted as counter-revolutionaries died by suicide. During Red August, 1,772 people were murdered in Beijing; many of the victims were teachers who were attacked or killed by their own students. In September, Shanghai experienced 704 suicides and 534 deaths; in Wuhan, 62 suicides and 32 murders occurred during the same period. Peng Dehuai was brought to Beijing to be publicly ridiculed.

=== Destruction of the Four Olds (August–November) ===

Between August and November 1966, eight mass rallies were held, drawing in 12 million people, most of whom were Red Guards. The government bore the travel expenses of Red Guards.

At the rallies, Lin called for the destruction of the Four Olds; namely, old customs, culture, habits, and ideas. Some changes associated with the Four Olds campaign were mainly benign, such as assigning new names to city streets, places, and even people; millions of babies were born with &quot;revolutionary&quot; names.

Other aspects were more destructive, particularly in the realms of culture and religion. Historical sites throughout the country were destroyed. The damage was particularly pronounced in the capital, Beijing. Red Guards laid siege to the Temple of Confucius in Qufu, and other historically significant tombs and artifacts.

Libraries of historical and foreign texts were destroyed; books were burned. Temples, churches, mosques, monasteries, and cemeteries were closed and sometimes converted to other uses, or looted and destroyed. Marxist propaganda depicted Buddhism as superstition, and religion was looked upon as a means of hostile foreign infiltration, as well as an instrument of the ruling class. Clergy were arrested and sent to camps; many Tibetan Buddhists were forced to participate in the destruction of their monasteries at gunpoint.

In September 1966, central Party authorities under Zhou Enlai issued the &quot;Instructions on Grasping Revolution, Promoting Production&quot;, which directed that &quot;one must grasp revolution on one hand and promote production on the other hand.

=== Central Work Conference (October) ===
In October 1966, Mao convened a Central Work Conference, mostly to enlist party leaders who had not yet adopted the latest ideology. Liu and Deng were prosecuted and begrudgingly offered self-criticism. After the conference, Liu, once a powerful moderate pundit, was placed under house arrest, then sent to a detention camp, where he was denied medical treatment and died in 1969. Deng was sent away for a period of re-education three times and was eventually sent to work in an engine factory in Jiangxi. Rebellion by party cadres accelerated after the conference.

=== End of the year ===
On 5 October, the Central Military Commission and the PLA&#x27;s Department of General Political Tasks directed military academies to dismiss their classes to allow cadets to become more involved in the Cultural Revolution. In doing so, they were acting on Lin Biao&#x27;s 23 August 1966 for &quot;three month turmoil&quot; in the PLA.

In Macau, rioting broke out during the 12-3 incident. The event was prompted by the colonial government&#x27;s delays in approving a new wing for a CCP elementary school in Taipa. The school board illegally began construction, but the colonial government sent police to stop the workers. Several people were injured in the resulting melee. On December 3, 1966, two days of rioting occurred in which hundreds were injured and six to eight were killed, leading to a total clampdown by the Portuguese government. The event set in motion Portugal&#x27;s de facto abdication of control over Macau, putting Macau on the path to eventual absorption by China.

By the beginning of 1967, a wide variety of grassroots political organizations had formed. Beyond Red Guard and student rebel groups, these included poor peasant associations, workers&#x27; pickets, and Mao Zedong Thought study societies, among others. Communist Party leaders encouraged these groups to &quot;join up&quot;, and these groups joined various coalitions and held various cross-group congresses and assemblies.

==1967: Seizure of power==
Mass organizations coalesced into two factions, the radicals who backed Mao&#x27;s purge of the Communist party, and the conservatives who backed the moderate party establishment. The &quot;support the left&quot; policy was established in January 1967. Mao&#x27;s policy was to support the rebels in seizing power; it required the PLA to support &quot;the broad masses of the revolutionary leftists in their struggle to seize power.&quot;

In March 1967, the policy was adapted into the &quot;Three Supports and Two Militaries&quot; initiative, in which PLA troops were sent to schools and work units across the country to stabilize political tumult and end factional warfare. The three &quot;Supports&quot; were to &quot;support the left&quot;, &quot;support the interior&quot;, &quot;support industry&quot;. The &quot;two Militaries&quot; referred to &quot;military management&quot; and &quot;military training&quot;. The policy of supporting the left failed to define &quot;leftists&quot; at a time when almost all mass organizations claimed to be &quot;leftist&quot; or &quot;revolutionary&quot;. PLA commanders had developed close working relations with the party establishment, leading many military units to repress radicals.

Spurred by the events in Beijing, power seizure groups formed across the country and began expanding into factories and the countryside. In Shanghai, a young factory worker named Wang Hongwen organized a far-reaching revolutionary coalition, one that displaced existing Red Guard groups. On 3 January 1967, with support from CRG heavyweights Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan, the group of firebrand activists overthrew the Shanghai municipal government under Chen Pixian in what became known as the January Storm, and formed in its place the Shanghai People&#x27;s Commune. Mao then expressed his approval.
Shanghai&#x27;s was the first provincial level government overthrown. Provincial governments and many parts of the state and party bureaucracy were affected, with power seizures taking place. In the next three weeks, 24 more province-level governments were overthrown. &quot;Revolutionary committees&quot; were subsequently established, in place of local governments and branches of the Communist Party. For example, in Beijing, three separate revolutionary groups declared power seizures on the same day. In Heilongjiang, local party secretary Pan Fusheng seized power from the party organization under his own leadership. Some leaders even wrote to the CRG asking to be overthrown.

In Beijing, Jiang Qing and Zhang Chunqiao targeted Vice-Premier Tao Zhu. The power-seizure movement was appearing in the military as well. In February, prominent generals Ye Jianying and Chen Yi, as well as Vice-Premier Tan Zhenlin, vocally asserted their opposition to the more extreme aspects of the movement, with some party elders insinuating that the CRG&#x27;s real motives were to remove the revolutionary old guard. Mao, initially ambivalent, took to the Politburo floor on 18 February to denounce the opposition directly, endorsing the radicals&#x27; activities. This resistance was branded the &quot;February Countercurrent&quot;—effectively silencing critics within the party.
Although in early 1967 popular insurgencies were limited outside of the biggest cities, local governments began collapsing all across China. Revolutionaries dismantled ruling government and party organizations, because power seizures lacked centralized leadership, it was no longer clear who believed in Mao&#x27;s revolutionary vision and who was exploiting the chaos for their own gain. The formation of rival revolutionary groups and manifestations of long-established local feuds, led to violent struggles between factions.

Tension grew between mass organizations and the military. In response, Lin Biao issued a directive for the army to aid the radicals. At the same time, the army took control of some provinces and locales that were deemed incapable of handling the power transition.

In Wuhan, as in many other cities, two major revolutionary organizations emerged, one supporting and one attacking the conservative establishment. Chen Zaidao, the Army general in charge of the area, forcibly repressed the anti-establishment demonstrators. Mao flew to Wuhan with a large entourage of central officials in an attempt to secure military loyalty in the area. On 20 July 1967, local agitators in response kidnapped Mao&#x27;s emissary Wang Li, in what became known as the Wuhan Incident. Subsequently, Chen was sent to Beijing and tried by Jiang Qing and the rest of the CRG. Chen&#x27;s resistance was the last major open display of opposition within the PLA.

The Gang of Four&#x27;s Zhang Chunqiao admitted that the most crucial factor in the Cultural Revolution was not the Red Guards or the CRG or the &quot;rebel worker&quot; organisations, but the PLA. When the PLA local garrison supported Mao&#x27;s radicals, they were able to take over the local government successfully, but if they were not cooperative, the takeovers were unsuccessful. Violent clashes occurred in virtually all major cities.

In response to the Wuhan Incident, Mao and Jiang began establishing a &quot;workers&#x27; armed self-defense force&quot;, a &quot;revolutionary armed force of mass character&quot; to counter what he saw as rightism in &quot;75% of the PLA officer corps&quot;. Meanwhile, a massive movement to &quot;smash gong-jian-fa&quot;, or to smash the Police, the Procuratorate and the Court, was carried out in mainland China. The few remaining going-jian-fa organizations were later placed under military control.
In Chongqing, an arms manufacturing center, during August 1967, battles involved close to 10,000 combatants, killed or wounded close to 1,000, and created 180,000 refugees in Chengdu alone. Chaotianmen harbor district was destroyed in a battle involving tanks, mobile artillery, and anti-aircraft guns. In Wuzhong, Ningxia, on 28 August 1967, Kang Sheng gave orders allowing the PLA to fire on opposing Hui Muslim factions, killing approximately 100 people and wounding 133. In Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, factory clashes killed 37, wounded 290, and led to 300 &quot;prisoners of war&quot;, two of whom were buried alive. At Shanghai Diesel Engine Plant, a battle in which Wang Hongwen led the victorious faction, killed 18 and wounded 983. In Lianyuan, fighting during July and August 1967 killed six and wounded 68. In Wenzhou, on 13 August 1967, two PLA units mistook each other for rebels and opened fire, killing seven people. At Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, on 10 August 1967, a firefight caused a panicked commercial pilot to depart early, stranding 54 Japanese passengers. 

Unconventional weapons, including weapon of mass destruction, were seized during conflicts, but not directly used. Citizens wrote letters to the Zhongnanhai residence of government leaders, warning of attacks on facilities that stored pathogenic bacteria, poisonous plant samples, radioactive substances, poison gas, toxicants, and other dangerous substances. In Changchun, rebels working in geological institutes developed and tested the first ever dirty bomb, testing two &quot;radioactive self-defense bombs&quot; and two &quot;radioactive self-defense mines&quot; on 6 and 11 August. 

Violence in 1967 disrupted economic activity and touring Red Guards overburdened China&#x27;s transportation system. By year end, national industrial output had decreased by 13.8% from the previous year.

Military control was imposed over the Daqing Oil Field in March 1967 and over the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant in August.

Nationwide, a total of 18.77 million firearms, 14,828 artillery pieces, 2,719,545 grenades ended up in civilian hands. They were used in the course of violent struggles, which mostly took place from 1967 to 1968. In Chongqing, Xiamen, and Changchun, tanks, armored vehicles and even warships were deployed in combat.

In late 1967, the PLA became the most powerful political force in the country. In 1967 and 1968, rebel groups supported by the PLA established Revolutionary Committees that replaced government and existing Party organizations at the local and provincial levels.

During the Cultural Revolution, Mao emphasized the need to improve medical care in rural China. The Rural Cooperative Medical System (RCMS) developed in the late 1960s. In this system, each large production brigade established a medical cooperative station staffed by barefoot doctors. The medical cooperative stations provided primary health care. Barefoot doctors brought healthcare to rural areas where urban-trained doctors would not settle. They promoted basic hygiene, preventive healthcare, and family planning and treated common illnesses. Immunizations were provided free of charge. Public healthcare was highly effective in curbing infectious diseases in rural China. For treatment of major diseases, rural people traveled to state-owned hospitals.

== 1968: Purges ==

In May 1968, Mao launched a massive political purge. Many people were sent to the countryside to work in reeducation camps. Generally, the campaign targeted rebels from the CR&#x27;s earlier, more populist, phase. On 27 July, the Red Guards&#x27; power over the PLA was officially ended, and the establishment sent in units to besiege areas that remained untouched by the Guards. A year later, the Red Guard factions were dismantled entirely; Mao predicted that the chaos might begin running its own agenda and be tempted to turn against revolutionary ideology. Their purpose had been largely fulfilled; Mao and his radical colleagues had largely overturned established power.

Liu was expelled from the CCP at the 12th Plenum of the 8th Central Committee in September, and labelled the &quot;headquarters of the bourgeoisie&quot;.

=== Mao meets with Red Guard leaders (July) ===
As the Red Guard movement had waned over the preceding year, violence by the remaining Red Guards increased on some Beijing campuses. Violence was particularly pronounced at Tsinghua University, where a few thousand hardliners of two factions continued to fight. At Mao&#x27;s initiative, on 27 July 1968, tens of thousands of workers entered the Tsinghua campus shouting slogans in opposition to the violence. Red Guards attacked the workers, who remained peaceful. Ultimately, the workers disarmed the students and occupied the campus.

On 28 July, Mao and the Central Group met with the five most important remaining Beijing Red Guard leaders to address the movement&#x27;s excessive violence and political exhaustion. It was the only time during the Cultural Revolution that Mao met and addressed the student leaders directly. In response to a Red Guard leader&#x27;s telegram sent prior to the meeting, which claimed that some &quot;Black Hand&quot; had maneuvered the workers against the Red Guards, Mao told the student leaders, &quot;The Black Hand is nobody else but me! ... I asked [the workers] how to solve the armed fighting in the universities, and told them to go there to have a look.&quot;

During the meeting, Mao and the Central Group for the Cultural Revolution stated, &quot;[W]e want cultural struggle, we do not want armed struggle&quot; and &quot;The masses do not want civil war.&quot;
===Mao&#x27;s cult of personality and &quot;mango fever&quot; (August) ===

In the spring of 1968, a massive campaign aimed at enhancing Mao&#x27;s reputation began. On 4 August, Mao was presented with mangoes by the Pakistani foreign minister Syed Sharifuddin Pirzada, in an apparent diplomatic gesture. Mao had his aide send the box of mangoes to his propaganda team at Tsinghua University on 5 August, who were stationed there to quiet strife among Red Guard factions.

Several months of &quot;mango fever&quot; followed as the fruit became a focus of a &quot;boundless loyalty&quot; campaign for Mao. More replica mangoes were created, and the replicas were sent on tour around Beijing and elsewhere. Many revolutionary committees visited the mangoes in Beijing from outlying provinces. Approximately half a million people greeted the replicas when they arrived in Chengdu. Badges and wall posters featuring the mangoes and Mao were produced in the millions.

The fruit was shared among all institutions that had been a part of the propaganda team, and large processions were organized in support of the &quot;precious gift&quot;, as the mangoes were known. A dentist in a small town, Dr. Han, saw the mango and said it was nothing special and looked just like a sweet potato. He was put on trial for &quot;malicious slander&quot;, found guilty, paraded publicly throughout the town, and then shot in the head.

It has been claimed that Mao used the mangoes to express support for the workers who would go to whatever lengths necessary to end the factional fighting among students, and a &quot;prime example of Mao&#x27;s strategy of symbolic support.&quot; Through early 1969, participants of Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Beijing returned with mass-produced mango facsimiles, gaining media attention in the provinces.

=== Down to the Countryside Movement (December) ===

In December 1968, Mao began the Down to the Countryside Movement. During this movement, which lasted for the following decade, young bourgeoisie living in cities were ordered to go to the countryside to experience working life. The term &quot;young intellectuals&quot; was used to refer to recent college graduates. In the late 1970s, these students returned to their home cities. Many students who were previously Red Guard supported the movement and Mao&#x27;s vision. This movement was thus in part a means of moving Red Guards from the cities to the countryside, where they would cause less social disruption. It also served to spread revolutionary ideology geographically.

== 1969–1971: Lin Biao ==
The 9th National Congress was held in April 1969. It served as a means to &quot;revitalize&quot; the party with fresh thinking—as well as new cadres, after much of the old guard had been destroyed in the struggles of the preceding years. The party framework established two decades earlier broke down almost entirely: rather than through an election by party members, delegates for this Congress were effectively selected by Revolutionary Committees. Representation of the military increased by a large margin from the previous Congress, reflected in the election of more PLA members to the new Central Committee—over 28%. Many officers now elevated to senior positions were loyal to PLA Marshal Lin Biao, which would open a new rift between the military and civilian leadership.
Reflecting this, Lin was officially elevated to become the Party&#x27;s preeminent figure outside of Mao, with his name written into the party constitution as his &quot;closest comrade-in-arms&quot; and &quot;universally recognized successor&quot;. At the time, no other Communist parties or governments anywhere in the world had adopted the practice of enshrining a successor to the current leader into their constitutions. Lin delivered the keynote address at the Congress: a document drafted by hardliner leftists Yao Wenyuan and Zhang Chunqiao under Mao&#x27;s guidance.

The report was heavily critical of Liu Shaoqi and other &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot; and drew extensively from quotations in the &quot;Little Red Book&quot;. The Congress solidified the central role of Maoism within the party, re-introducing Maoism as the official guiding ideology in the party constitution. The Congress elected a new Politburo with Mao, Lin, Chen, Zhou Enlai and Kang as the members of the new Politburo Standing Committee.

Lin, Chen, and Kang were all beneficiaries of the Cultural Revolution. Zhou, who was demoted in rank, voiced his unequivocal support for Lin at the Congress. Mao restored the function of some formal party institutions, such as the operations of the Politburo, which ceased functioning between 1966 and 1968 because the CCRG held de facto control.

In early 1970, the nationwide &quot;One Strike-Three Anti Campaign&quot; was launched by Mao and the Communist Party Central, aiming to consolidate the new organs of power by targeting counterrevolutionary thoughts and actions. A large number of &quot;minor criminals&quot; were executed or forced to commit suicide between 1970 and 1972. According to government statistics released after the Cultural Revolution, during the campaign 1.87 million people were persecuted as traitors, spies, and counterrevolutionaries, and over 284,800 were arrested or killed from February to November 1970 alone.

===PLA encroachment===
Mao&#x27;s efforts at re-organizing party and state institutions generated mixed results. The situation in some of the provinces remained volatile, even as the political situation in Beijing stabilized. Factional struggles, many violent, continued at a local level despite the declaration that the 9th National Congress marked a temporary victory for the CR. Furthermore, despite Mao&#x27;s efforts to put on a show of unity at the Congress, the factional divide between Lin&#x27;s PLA camp and the Jiang-led radical camp was intensifying. Indeed, a personal dislike of Jiang drew many civilian leaders, including Chen, closer to Lin.

Between 1966 and 1968, China was isolated internationally, having declared its enmity towards both the USSR and the US. The friction with the USSR intensified after border clashes on the Ussuri River in March 1969 as Chinese leaders prepared for all-out war. In June 1969, the PLA&#x27;s enforcement of political discipline and suppression of the factions that had emerged during the Cultural Revolution became intertwined with the central Party&#x27;s efforts to accelerate Third Front. Those who did not return to work would be viewed as engaging in &#x27;schismatic activity&#x27; which risked undermining preparations to defend China from potential invasion.

In October 1969, the Party attempted to focus more on war preparedness and less on suppressing factions. That month, senior leaders were evacuated from Beijing. Amid the tension, Lin issued the &quot;Order Number One&quot;, which appeared to be an executive order to prepare for war to the PLA&#x27;s eleven military regions on October 18 without going through Mao. This drew the ire of the chairman, who saw it as evidence that his declared successor was usurping his authority.

The prospect of war elevated the PLA to greater prominence in domestic politics, increasing Lin&#x27;s stature at Mao&#x27;s expense. Some evidence suggests that Mao was pushed to seek closer relations with the US as a means to avoid PLA dominance that would result from a military confrontation with the Soviet Union. During his later meeting with Richard Nixon in 1972, Mao hinted that Lin had opposed better relations with the U.S.

==== Restoration of State Chairman position ====

After Lin was confirmed as Mao&#x27;s successor, his supporters focused on the restoration of the position of State Chairman, which had been abolished by Mao after Liu&#x27;s purge. They hoped that by allowing Lin to ease into a constitutionally sanctioned role, whether Chairman or vice-chairman, Lin&#x27;s succession would be institutionalized. The consensus within the Politburo was that Mao should assume the office with Lin as vice-chairman; but perhaps wary of Lin&#x27;s ambitions or for other unknown reasons, Mao voiced his explicit opposition.

Factional rivalries intensified at the Second Plenum of the Ninth Congress in Lushan held in late August 1970. Chen, now aligned with the PLA faction loyal to Lin, galvanized support for the restoration of the office of President of China, despite Mao&#x27;s wishes. Moreover, Chen launched an assault on Zhang, a staunch Maoist who embodied the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, over the evaluation of Mao&#x27;s legacy.

The attacks on Zhang found favour with many Plenum attendees and may have been construed by Mao as an indirect attack on the CR. Mao confronted Chen openly, denouncing him as a &quot;false Marxist&quot;, and removed him from the Politburo Standing Committee. In addition to the purge of Chen, Mao asked Lin&#x27;s principal generals to write self-criticisms on their political positions as a warning to Lin. Mao also inducted several of his supporters to the Central Military Commission and placed loyalists in leadership roles of the Beijing Military Region.

===Project 571===
By 1971, the diverging interests of the civilian and military leaders was apparent. Mao was troubled by the PLA&#x27;s newfound prominence, and the purge of Chen marked the beginning of a gradual scaling-down of the PLA&#x27;s political involvement. According to official sources, sensing the reduction of Lin&#x27;s power base and his declining health, Lin&#x27;s supporters plotted to use the military power still at their disposal to oust Mao in a coup.

Lin&#x27;s son Lin Liguo, along with other high-ranking military conspirators, formed a coup apparatus in Shanghai and dubbed the plan to oust Mao &quot;Outline for Project 571&quot;in the original Mandarin, the phrase sounds similar to the term for &#x27;military uprising&#x27;. It is disputed whether Lin Biao was directly involved in this process. While official sources maintain that Lin did plan and execute the coup attempt, scholars such as Jin Qiu portray Lin as passive, cajoled by elements among his family and supporters. Qiu contests that Lin Biao was ever personally involved in drafting the &quot;Outline&quot;, with evidence suggesting that Lin Liguo was directly responsible for the draft.
==== Lin&#x27;s flight and plane crash ====
According to the official narrative, on 13 September Lin Biao, his wife Ye Qun, Lin Liguo, and members of his staff attempted to flee to the USSR ostensibly to seek political asylum. En route, Lin&#x27;s plane crashed in Mongolia, killing all on board. The plane apparently ran out of fuel. A Soviet investigative team was not able to determine the cause of the crash but hypothesized that the pilot was flying low to evade radar and misjudged the plane&#x27;s altitude.

The account was questioned by those who raised doubts over Lin&#x27;s choice of the USSR as a destination, the plane&#x27;s route, the identity of the passengers, and whether or not a coup was actually taking place.

On 13 September, the Politburo met in an emergency session to discuss Lin. His death was confirmed in Beijing only on 30 September, which led to the cancellation of the National Day celebration events the following day. The Central Committee did not release news of Lin&#x27;s death to the public until two months later. Many Lin supporters sought refuge in Hong Kong. Those who remained on the mainland were purged.

The event caught the party leadership off guard: the concept that Lin could betray Mao de-legitimized a vast body of Cultural Revolution political rhetoric and by extension, Mao&#x27;s absolute authority. For several months following the incident, the party information apparatus struggled to find a &quot;correct way&quot; to frame the incident for public consumption, but as the details came to light, the majority of the Chinese public felt disillusioned and realised they had been manipulated for political purposes.

== 1972–1976: The Gang of Four ==
Mao became depressed and reclusive after the Lin incident. Sensing a sudden loss of direction, Mao reached out to old comrades whom he had denounced in the past. Meanwhile, in September 1972, Mao transferred a 38-year-old cadre from Shanghai, Wang Hongwen, to Beijing and made him Party vice-chairman. Wang, a former factory worker from a peasant background, was seemingly getting groomed for succession.

Jiang&#x27;s position strengthened after Lin&#x27;s flight. She held tremendous influence with the radical camp. With Mao&#x27;s health on the decline, Jiang&#x27;s political ambitions began to emerge. She allied herself with Wang and propaganda specialists Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan, forming a political clique later pejoratively dubbed as the Gang of Four.
By 1973, round after round of political struggles had left many lower-level institutions, including local government, factories, and railways, short of competent staff to carry out basic functions. China&#x27;s economy had fallen into disarray, which led to the rehabilitation of purged lower-level officials. The party&#x27;s core became heavily dominated by Cultural Revolution beneficiaries and radicals, whose focus remained ideological purity over economic productivity. The economy remained mostly Zhou&#x27;s domain, one of the few remaining moderates. Zhou attempted to restore the economy, but was resented by the Gang of Four, who identified him as their primary political succession threat.

In late 1973, to weaken Zhou&#x27;s political position and to distance themselves from Lin&#x27;s apparent betrayal, the Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius campaign began under Jiang&#x27;s leadership. Its stated goals were to purge China of New Confucianist thinking and denounce Lin&#x27;s actions as traitorous and regressive.

=== Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s rehabilitation (1975) ===
Deng Xiaoping returned to the political scene, assuming the post of Vice-Premier in March 1973, in the first of a series of Mao-approved promotions. After Zhou withdrew from active politics in January 1975, Deng was effectively put in charge of the government, party, and military, then adding the additional titles of PLA General Chief of Staff, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, and vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission.

Mao wanted to use Deng as a counterweight to the military faction in government to suppress former Lin loyalists. In addition, Mao had also lost confidence in the Gang of Four and saw Deng as the alternative. Leaving the country in grinding poverty would damage the positive legacy of the CR, which Mao worked hard to protect. Deng&#x27;s return set the scene for a protracted factional struggle between the radical Gang of Four and moderates led by Zhou and Deng.

At the time, Jiang and associates held effective control of mass media and the party&#x27;s propaganda network, while Zhou and Deng held control of most government organs. On some decisions, Mao sought to mitigate the Gang&#x27;s influence, but on others, he acquiesced to their demands. The Gang of Four&#x27;s political and media control did not prevent Deng from enacting his economic policies. Deng emphatically opposed Party factionalism, and his policies aimed to promote unity to restore economic productivity. Much like the post-Great Leap restructuring led by Liu Shaoqi, Deng streamlined the railway system, steel production, etc. By late 1975, however, Mao saw that Deng&#x27;s economic restructuring might negate the CR&#x27;s legacy and launched the Counterattack the Right-Deviationist Reversal-of-Verdicts Trend, a campaign to oppose &quot;rehabilitating the case for the rightists&quot;, alluding to Deng as the country&#x27;s foremost &quot;rightist&quot;. Mao directed Deng to write self-criticisms in November 1975, a move lauded by the Gang of Four.

===Death of Zhou Enlai===
On 8 January 1976, Zhou Enlai died of bladder cancer. On 15 January, Deng delivered Zhou&#x27;s eulogy in a funeral attended by all of China&#x27;s most senior leaders with the notable absence of Mao, who had grown increasingly critical of Zhou. After Zhou&#x27;s death, Mao selected the relatively unknown Hua Guofeng instead of a member of the Gang of Four or Deng to become Premier.

The Gang of Four grew apprehensive that spontaneous, large-scale popular support for Zhou could turn the political tide against them. They acted through the media to impose restrictions on public displays of mourning for Zhou. Years of resentment over the CR, the public persecution of Deng—seen as Zhou&#x27;s ally—and the prohibition against public mourning led to a rise in popular discontent against Mao and the Gang of Four. Official attempts to enforce the mourning restrictions included removing public memorials and tearing down posters commemorating Zhou&#x27;s achievements. On 25 March 1976, Shanghai&#x27;s &quot;Wen Hui Bao&quot; published an article calling Zhou &quot;the capitalist roader inside the Party [who] wanted to help the unrepentant capitalist roader [Deng] regain his power.&quot; These propaganda efforts at smearing Zhou&#x27;s image, however, only strengthened public attachment to Zhou&#x27;s memory.

===Tiananmen incident===
On 4 April 1976, on the eve of China&#x27;s annual Qingming Festival, a traditional day of mourning, thousands of people gathered around the Monument to the People&#x27;s Heroes in Tiananmen Square to commemorate Zhou. They honored Zhou by laying wreaths, banners, poems, placards, and flowers at the foot of the Monument. The most apparent purpose of this memorial was to eulogize Zhou, but the Gang of Four were also attacked for their actions against the Premier. A small number of slogans left at Tiananmen even attacked Mao and his Cultural Revolution.

Up to two million people may have visited Tiananmen Square on 4 April. All levels of society, from the most impoverished peasants to high-ranking PLA officers and the children of high-ranking cadres, were represented in the activities. Those who participated were motivated by a mixture of anger over Zhou&#x27;s treatment, revolt against the Cultural Revolution and apprehension for China&#x27;s future. The event did not appear to have coordinated leadership.

The Central Committee, under the leadership of Jiang Qing, labelled the event &#x27;counter-revolutionary&#x27; and cleared the square of memorial items shortly after midnight on April 6. Attempts to suppress the mourners led to a riot. Police cars were set on fire, and a crowd of over 100,000 people forced its way into several government buildings surrounding the square. Many of those arrested were later sentenced to prison. Similar incidents occurred in other major cities. Jiang and her allies attacked Deng as the incident&#x27;s &#x27;mastermind&#x27;, and issued reports on official media to that effect. Deng was formally stripped of all positions inside and outside the Party on 7 April. This marked Deng&#x27;s second purge.

===Death of Mao Zedong and the Gang of Four&#x27;s downfall===

On 9 September 1976, Mao Zedong died. To Mao&#x27;s supporters, his death symbolized the loss of China&#x27;s revolutionary foundation. His death was announced on 9 September. The nation descended into grief and mourning, with people weeping in the streets and public institutions closing for over a week. Hua Guofeng chaired the Funeral Committee and delivered the memorial speech.

Shortly before dying, Mao had allegedly written the message &quot;With you in charge, I&#x27;m at ease,&quot; to Hua. Hua used this message to substantiate his position as successor. Hua had been widely considered to be lacking in political skill and ambitions, and seemingly posed no serious threat to the Gang of Four in the race for succession. However, the Gang&#x27;s radical ideas also clashed with influential elders and many Party reformers. With army backing and the support of Marshal Ye Jianying, Director of Central Office Wang Dongxing, Vice Premier Li Xiannian and party elder Chen Yun, on 6 October, the Central Security Bureau&#x27;s Special Unit 8341 had all members of the Gang of Four arrested in a bloodless coup.

After Mao&#x27;s death, people characterized as &#x27;beating-smashing-looting elements&#x27;, who were seen as having disturbed the social order during the CR, were purged or punished. &quot;Beating-smashing-looting elements&quot; had typically been aligned with rebel factions.

==Aftermath==

=== Transitional period ===
Although Hua denounced the Gang of Four in 1976, he continued to invoke Mao&#x27;s name to justify Mao-era policies. Hua spearheaded what became known as the Two Whatevers. Like Deng, Hua wanted to reverse the CR&#x27;s damage; but unlike Deng, who wanted new economic models for China, Hua intended to move the Chinese economic and political system towards Soviet-style planning.

It became increasingly clear to Hua, that without Deng, it was difficult to continue daily affairs of state. On 10 October, Deng wrote a letter to Hua asking to be transferred back to state and party affairs; party elders also called for Deng&#x27;s return. With increasing pressure from all sides, Premier Hua named Deng Vice-Premier in July 1977, and later promoted him to various other positions, effectively elevating Deng to be China&#x27;s second-most powerful figure. In August, the 11th National Congress was held in Beijing, officially naming (in ranking order) Hua Guofeng, Ye Jianying, Deng Xiaoping, Li Xiannian and Wang Dongxing as new members of the Politburo Standing Committee.

===Repudiation and reform under Deng===

Deng Xiaoping first proposed what he called &quot;Boluan Fanzheng&quot; in September 1977 in order to correct the mistakes of the Cultural Revolution. In May 1978, Deng seized the opportunity to elevate his protégé Hu Yaobang to power. Hu published an article in the &quot;Guangming Daily&quot;, making clever use of Mao&#x27;s quotations, while lauding Deng&#x27;s ideas. Following this article, Hua began to shift his tone in support of Deng. On 1 July, Deng publicized Mao&#x27;s self-criticism report of 1962 regarding the failure of the Great Leap Forward. As his power base expanded, in September Deng began openly attacking Hua Guofeng&#x27;s &quot;Two Whatevers&quot;. The &quot;1978 Truth Criterion Discussion&quot;, launched by Deng and Hu and their allies, also triggered a decade-long New Enlightenment movement in mainland China, promoting democracy, humanism and universal values, while opposing the ideology of Cultural Revolution.

On 18 December 1978, Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee was held. Deng called for &quot;a liberation of thoughts&quot; and urged the party to &quot;seek truth from facts&quot; and abandon ideological dogma. The Plenum officially marked the beginning of the economic reform era. Hua Guofeng engaged in self-criticism and called his &quot;Two Whatevers&quot; a mistake. At the Plenum, the Party reversed its verdict on the Tiananmen Incident. Former Chinese president Liu Shaoqi was given a belated state funeral. Peng Dehuai, who was persecuted to death during the Cultural Revolution was rehabilitated in 1978.

At the Fifth Plenum held in 1980, Peng Zhen, He Long and other leaders who had been purged during the Cultural Revolution were rehabilitated. Hu Yaobang became head of the party secretariat as its secretary-general. In September, Hua Guofeng resigned, and Zhao Ziyang, another Deng ally, was named premier. Hua remained on the Central Military Commission, but formal power was transferred to a new generation of pragmatic reformers, who reversed Cultural Revolution policies to a large extent. Within a few years, Deng and Hu helped rehabilitate over 3 million &quot;unjust, false, erroneous&quot; cases. In particular, the trial of the Gang of Four took place in Beijing from 1980 to 1981, and the court stated that 729,511 people had been persecuted by the Gang, of whom 34,800 were said to have died.

In 1981, the Chinese Communist Party passed a resolution and declared that the Cultural Revolution was &quot;responsible for the most severe setback and the heaviest losses suffered by the Party, the country, and the people since the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic.&quot;

== Atrocities ==
===Death toll===
Fatality estimates vary across different sources, ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions, or even tens of millions. In addition to various regimes of secrecy and obfuscation concerning the Revolution, both top-down as perpetuated by authorities, as well as laterally among the Chinese public in the decades since, the discrepancies are due in large part to the totalistic nature of the Revolution itself: it is a significant challenge for historians to discern whether and in what ways discrete events that took place during the Cultural Revolution should be ascribed to it.

Most deaths occurred after the mass movements ended, when organized campaigns attempted to consolidate order in workplaces and communities. As Walder summarizes, &quot;The cure for factional warfare was far worse than the disease.&quot; Serious man-made disasters such as the 1975 Banqiao Dam failure, also caused many deaths.

Literature reviews of the overall death toll due to the Cultural Revolution usually include the following:
=== Massacres ===
Massacres took place across China, including in Guangxi, Inner Mongolia, Guangdong, Yunnan, Hunan, Ruijin, and Qinghai, as well as Red August in Beijing.

These massacres were mainly led and organized by local revolutionary committees, Communist Party branches, militia, and the military. Most victims were members of the Five Black Categories as well as their children, or members of &quot;rebel groups&quot;. Chinese scholars have estimated that at least 300,000 people died in these massacres. Collective killings in Guangxi and Guangdong were among the most serious. In Guangxi, the official annals of at least 43 counties have records of massacres, with 15 of them reporting a death toll of over 1,000, while in Guangdong at least 28 county annals record massacres, with 6 of them reporting a death toll of over 1,000.

Official sources in 1980 revealed that, during the Red August, at least 1,772 people were killed by Red Guards, including teachers and principals of many schools, meanwhile 33,695 homes were ransacked and 85,196 families were forced to flee. The Daxing Massacre in rural Beijing caused the deaths of 325 people from 27 August to 1 September 1966; those killed ranged from 80 years old to a 38-day old baby, with 22 families being completely wiped out.

In Dao County, Hunan, a total of 7,696 people were killed from 13 August to 17 October 1967, in addition to 1,397 forced to commit suicide, and 2,146 becoming permanently disabled. 

In the Guangxi Massacre, the official record shows an estimated death toll from 100,000 to 150,000 as well as cannibalism primarily between 1967 and 1968 in Guangxi, where one of the worst violent struggles of the Revolution took place, before Zhou sent the PLA to intervene.

In 1975, the PLA led a massacre in Yunnan around the town of Shadian, targeting Hui people, resulting in the deaths of more than 1,600 civilians, including 300 children, and the destruction of 4,400 homes.

=== Violent struggles, struggle sessions, and purges ===

&quot;Violent struggles&quot; were factional conflicts (mostly among Red Guards and &quot;rebel groups&quot;) that began in Shanghai and then spread to other areas in 1967. They brought the country to a state of civil war. Weapons used included some 18.77 million guns, 2.72 million grenades, 14,828 cannons, millions of other ammunition and even armored cars and tanks. Notable violent struggles include the battles in Chongqing, in Sichuan, and in Xuzhou. Researchers claimed that the nationwide death toll in violent struggles ranged from 300,000 to 500,000.

The recorded rate of violence rose in 1967, reaching a peak that summer before dropping suddenly. During 1967, casualties were relatively low as the weapons used were primarily clubs, spears, and rocks until late July. Although firearms and heavier weapons began to spread during summer, most were neither trained nor committed fighters and therefore casualties remained relatively low. The peak of collective violence in summer 1967 dropped sharply after August, when Mao became concerned about rebel attacks on local army units and thereafter made clear that his prior calls to &quot;drag out&quot; army commanders was a mistake and he would instead support besieged army commands.

The greatest number of casualties occurred during the process of restoring order in 1968, although the overall number of violent conflicts was lower. Walder stated that while &quot;rising casualties from a smaller number of insurgent conflicts surely reflected the increasing scale and organizational coherence of rebel factions, and their growing access to military weaponry[,]&quot; another important factor was that &quot;[t]he longer that local factional warfare continued without the prospect of an equitable political settlement, the greater the stakes for the participants and the more intense the collective violence as factions fought to avoid the consequence of losing.&quot;

In addition to violent struggles, millions of Chinese were violently persecuted, especially via struggle sessions. Those identified as spies, &quot;running dogs&quot;, &quot;revisionists&quot;, or coming from a suspect class (including those related to former landlords or rich peasants) were subject to beating, imprisonment, rape, torture, sustained and systematic harassment and abuse, seizure of property, denial of medical attention, and erasure of social identity. Some people were not able to stand the torture and committed suicide. Researchers claimed that at least 100,000 to 200,000 people committed suicide during the early CR. 

At the same time, many &quot;unjust, false, and mistaken&quot; cases appeared due to political purges. In addition to those who died in massacres, a large number of people died or became permanently disabled due to lynching or other forms of persecution. From 1968 to 1969, the Cleansing the Class Ranks purge caused the deaths of at least 500,000 people. Purges of similar nature such as the One Strike-Three Anti Campaign and the campaign towards the May Sixteenth elements were launched in the 1970s. For example, a political purge in Yunnan province, the Zhao Jianmin spy case, resulted in 17,000 deaths and wrongfully persecuted a total of 1.38 million people. 

=== Repression of ethnic minorities ===


The Cultural Revolution wrought havoc on minority cultures and ethnicities. Languages and customs of ethnic minorities in China were labeled as part of the Four Olds, texts in ethnic languages were burned, and bilingual education was suppressed. In Inner Mongolia, some 790,000 people were persecuted during the Inner Mongolia incident. Of these, 22,900 were beaten to death, and 120,000 were maimed, during a witch hunt to find members of the alleged separatist New Inner Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party. In Xinjiang, copies of the Qur&#x27;an and other books of the Uyghur people were apparently burned. Muslim imams reportedly were paraded around with paint splashed on their bodies. In the ethnic Korean areas of northeast China, clashes took place.

In Yunnan Province, the palace of the Dai people&#x27;s king was torched, and a massacre of Muslim Hui people at the hands of the PLA in Yunnan, known as the Shadian incident, reportedly claimed over 1,600 lives in 1975. After the Cultural Revolution, the government gave reparations for the Shadian Incident, including the erection of a Martyr&#x27;s Memorial in Shadian.

Concessions to minorities were abolished during the Cultural Revolution as part of the Red Guards&#x27; attack on the &quot;Four Olds&quot;. People&#x27;s communes, previously only established in parts of Tibet, were established throughout Tibetan Autonomous Region in 1966, removing Tibet&#x27;s exemption from China&#x27;s land reform, and reimposed in other minority areas. The effect on Tibet was particularly severe as it came following the repression after the 1959 Tibetan uprising. The destruction of nearly all of its over 6,000 monasteries, which began before the Cultural Revolution, were often conducted with the complicity of local ethnic Tibetan Red Guards. Only eight were intact by the end of the 1970s.

Many monks and nuns were killed, and the general population was subjected to physical and psychological torture. An estimated 600,000 monks and nuns lived in Tibet in 1950, but by 1979, most were dead, imprisoned or had disappeared. The Tibetan government in exile claimed that many Tibetans died from famines in 1961–1964 and 1968–1973 as a result of forced collectivization, however, the number of Tibetan deaths or whether famines, in fact, took place in these periods is disputed. Despite persecution, some local leaders and minority ethnic practices survived in remote regions.

It was felt that pushing minority groups too hard would compromise China&#x27;s border defenses. This was especially important as minorities make up a large percentage of the population that live in border regions. In the late 1960s, China experienced a period of strained relations with some of its neighbors, notably with the Soviet Union and India.

=== Rape and sexual abuse ===

Pan Suiming, Emily Honig, and others documented that rape and sexual abuse of sent-down women were common during the Cultural Revolution&#x27;s height. Tania Branigan documented that women raped tended to be from educated urban backgrounds while their rapists were poor peasants or local officials.

== Cultural impact and influence ==

=== Red Guards riot ===
The revolution aimed to destroy the Four Olds and establish the corresponding Four News, which ranged from changing of names and cutting of hair to ransacking homes, vandalizing cultural treasures, and desecrating temples.

The revolution aimed to eliminate cow demons and snake spirits - the class enemies who promoted bourgeois ideas, as well as those from an exploitative family background or who belonged to one of the Five Black Categories. Large numbers of people perceived to be &quot;monsters and demons&quot; regardless of guilt or innocence were publicly denounced, humiliated, and beaten. In their revolutionary fervor, students, especially the Red Guards, denounced their teachers, and children denounced their parents. Many died from ill-treatment or committed suicide. In 1968, youths were mobilized to go to the countryside in the Down to the Countryside Movement so they may learn from the peasantry, and the departure of millions from the cities helped end the most violent phase of the Cultural Revolution.

=== Academics and intellectuals ===
Academics and intellectuals were regarded as the &quot;Stinking Old Ninth&quot; and were widely persecuted. Many were sent to rural labor camps such as the May Seventh Cadre School. The prosecution of the Gang of Four revealed that 142,000 cadres and teachers in the education circles were persecuted. Academics, scientists, and educators who died included Xiong Qinglai, Jian Bozan, Wu Han, Rao Yutai, Wu Dingliang, Yao Tongbin and Zhao Jiuzhang. As of 1968, among the 171 senior members who worked at the headquarters of Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, 131 were persecuted. Among the members of the academy, 229 died. As of September 1971, more than 4,000 staff members of China&#x27;s nuclear center in Qinghai had been persecuted, while more than 310 were disabled, over 40 committed suicide, and 5 were executed. 

Despite the hardships, some significant achievements came in science and technology: scientists tested the first missile, created China&#x27;s first hydrogen bomb and launched China&#x27;s first satellite in the &quot;Two Bombs, One Satellite&quot; program. 

Many health personnel were deployed to the countryside as barefoot doctors. Some farmers were given informal medical training, and health-care centers were established in rural communities. This process led to a marked improvement in health and life expectancy.

=== Education system ===
In the early months of Cultural Revolution, schools and universities were closed. Secondary school classes of 1966, 1967, and 1968 were unable to graduate on time later and became known as the &quot;Old Three Cohort (老三届)&quot;. Colleges and universities were closed until 1970, and most universities did not reopen until 1972. University entrance exams were cancelled after 1966 (until the beginning of &quot;Boluan Fanzheng&quot; period in 1977), replaced by a system whereby students were recommended by factories, villages and military units. Traditional values were abandoned. On the other hand, industrial Universities were established in factories to supply technical and engineering programs for industrial workers, inspired by Mao&#x27;s July 1968 remarks advocating vocational education. Factories around the country therefore established their own educational programs for technicians and engineers, and by 1976, there were 15,000 such 21 July Universities.

Meanwhile, in the initial stage of the Down to the Countryside Movement, most of the youth who took part volunteered. Later on, the government forced them to move. Between 1968 and 1979, 17 million urban youth left for the countryside. Living in the rural areas deprived them of higher education. This generation is sometimes referred to as the &quot;lost generation&quot;. In the post-Mao period, many of those forcibly moved attacked the policy as a violation of their human rights. Formal literacy measurements did not resume until the 1980s. Some counties in Zhanjiang had literacy rates as low as 59% 20 years after the revolution. This was amplified by the elimination of qualified teachers—many districts were forced to rely on students to teach. 

Primary and middle schools gradually reopened during the Cultural Revolution. Schooling years were reduced and education standards fell, but the proportion of Chinese children who completed primary education increased from less than half to almost all, and the fraction who completed junior middle school rose from 15% to over two-thirds. Educational opportunities for rural children expanded, while education of the urban elite were restricted by anti-elitist policies. Radical policies provided many in rural communities with middle school education for the first time. Rural infrastructure developed during this period, facilitated by the political changes that empowered ordinary rurals.

===Slogans and rhetoric===

Huang claimed that the Cultural Revolution had massive effects on Chinese society because of the extensive use of political slogans. He claimed that slogans played a central role in rallying Party leadership and citizens. For example, the slogan &quot;to rebel is justified&quot; () affected many views.
Huang asserted that slogans were ubiquitous in people&#x27;s lives, printed onto everyday items such as bus tickets, cigarette packets, and mirror tables. Workers were supposed to &quot;grasp revolution and promote productions&quot;, while peasants were supposed to raise more pigs because &quot;more pigs means more manure, and more manure means more grain.&quot; Even a casual remark by Mao, &quot;Sweet potato tastes good; I like it&quot; became a slogan.

Political slogans had three sources: Mao, Party media such as &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot;, and the Red Guards. Mao often offered vague, yet powerful directives that divided the Red Guards. These directives could be interpreted to suit personal interests, in turn aiding factions&#x27; goals in claiming loyalty to Mao. Red Guard slogans were violent, advancing themes such as &quot;Strike the enemy down on the floor and step on him with a foot&quot;, &quot;Long live the red terror!&quot; and &quot;Those who are against Chairman Mao will have their dog skulls smashed into pieces.&quot;

Dittmer and Ruoxi claim that the Chinese language had historically been defined by subtlety, delicacy, moderation, and honesty, as well as the cultivation of a &quot;refined and elegant literary style&quot;. This changed during the CR. These slogans were an effective method of &quot;thought reform&quot;, mobilizing millions in a concerted attack upon the subjective world, &quot;while at the same time reforming their objective world.&quot;

Dittmer and Chen argued that the emphasis on politics made language into effective propaganda, but &quot;also transformed it into a jargon of stereotypes—pompous, repetitive, and boring&quot;. To distance itself from the era, Deng&#x27;s government cut back on political slogans. During a eulogy for Deng&#x27;s death, Jiang Zemin called the Cultural Revolution a &quot;grave mistake&quot;.

===Arts and literature===
In 1966, Jiang Qing advanced the &quot;Theory of the Dictatorship of the Black Line&quot;. Those perceived to be bourgeois, anti-socialist or anti-Mao (black line) should be cast aside, and called for the creation of new literature and arts. Disseminators of the &quot;old culture&quot; would be eradicated. The majority of writers and artists were seen as &quot;black line figures&quot; and &quot;reactionary literati&quot;, and were persecuted, and subjected to &quot;criticism and denunciation&quot; where they could be humiliated and ravaged, and be imprisoned or sent to hard labour. For instance, Mei Zhi and her husband were sent to a tea farm in Lushan County, Sichuan. She did not resume writing until the 1980s. 

In 1970, the CCP came to view the Ministry of Culture as so disruptive that it decided to dissolve the Ministry and establish a Culture Group within the State Council in an effort to rein in cultural politics. The principles for cultural production laid out by Mao in the 1942 &quot;Talks at the Yan&#x27;an Forum on Art and Literature&quot; became dogmatized. The literary situation eased after 1972, as more were allowed to write, and many provincial literary periodicals resumed publication, but the majority of writers still could not work. Documents released in 1980 regarding the prosecution of the Gang of Four show that more than 2,600 people in the field of arts and literature were persecuted by the Ministry of Culture. Many died: the names of 200 writers and artists who were persecuted to death were commemorated in 1979. These include writers such as Lao She, Fu Lei, Deng Tuo, Baren, Li Guangtian, Yang Shuo and Zhao Shuli.
==== Opera and music ====
Jiang took control of the stage and introduced revolutionary operas under her direct supervision. Traditional operas were banned as they were considered feudalistic and bourgeois, but revolutionary opera, which modified Peking opera in both content and form, was promoted. Six operas and two ballets were produced in the first three years, most notably the opera &quot;The Legend of the Red Lantern&quot;. These operas were the only approved opera form. Other opera troupes were required to adopt or change their repertoire. Loyalty dances became common and were performed throughout the country by both professional cultural workers and ordinary people. The model operas were broadcast on the radio, made into films, blared from public loudspeakers, taught to students in schools and workers in factories, and became ubiquitous as a form of popular entertainment and were the only theatrical entertainment for millions. Most model dramas featured women as their leads and promoted Chinese state feminism. Their narratives begin with them oppressed by misogyny, class position, and imperialism before liberating themselves through the discovery of internal strength and the CCP.

During the Cultural Revolution, composers of &quot;Yellow Music&quot;, which had already been banned following the communist revolution, were persecuted, including Li Jinhui who was killed in 1967. Revolution-themed songs instead were promoted, and songs such as &quot;Ode to the Motherland&quot;, &quot;Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman&quot;, &quot;The East Is Red&quot; and &quot;Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China&quot; were either written or became popular during this period. &quot;The East Is Red&quot;, especially, became popular; it &quot;de facto&quot; supplanted &quot;March of the Volunteers&quot; (lyrics author Tian Han persecuted to death) as the national anthem of China, though the latter was later restored to its previous place. Moreover, &quot;quotation songs&quot;, in which Mao&#x27;s quotations were set to music, were particularly popular during the early years of the Cultural Revolution. Records of quotation songs were played over loudspeakers, their primary distribution, as the use of transistor radios lagged until 1976. &quot;Rusticated youths&quot; with an interest in broadcast technology frequently operated rural radio stations after 1968.

====Visual arts====
Traditional themes were sidelined and artists such as Feng Zikai, Shi Lu, and Pan Tianshou were persecuted. Many of the artists were assigned to manual labour, and artists were expected to depict subjects that glorified the Cultural Revolution related to their labour. In 1971, in part to alleviate their suffering, several leading artists were recalled from manual labour or freed from captivity under a Zhou initiative to decorate hotels and railway stations defaced by Red Guard slogans. Zhou said that the artworks were meant for foreigners, therefore were &quot;outer&quot; art and not under the obligations and restrictions placed on &quot;inner&quot; art meant for Chinese citizens. He claimed that landscape paintings should not be considered one of the &quot;Four Olds&quot;. However, Zhou was weakened by cancer, and in 1974, the Jiang faction seized these and other paintings and mounted exhibitions in Beijing, Shanghai and other cities denouncing the artworks as &quot;Black Paintings&quot;.

Propaganda in posters was used as a mass communication device and often served as the people&#x27;s leading source of information. They were produced in large numbers and widely disseminated, and were used by the government and Red Guards to push ideology defined by the Party. The two main posters genres were the big-character poster or &quot;dazibao&quot; and commercial propaganda poster.

* The &quot;dazibao&quot; presented slogans, poems, commentary and graphics often posted on walls in public spaces, factories and communes. Mao wrote his own &quot;dazibao&quot; at Beijing University on 5 August 1966, calling on the people to &quot;Bombard the Headquarters&quot;.
* &quot;Xuanchuanhua,&quot; or propaganda paintings, were artworks produced by the government and sold cheaply in stores to be displayed in homes or workplaces. The artists for these posters might be amateurs or uncredited professionals, and the posters were largely in a Socialist Realist visual style with specific conventions—for example, images of Mao were to be depicted as &quot;red, smooth, and luminescent&quot;.

Some scholar also argued that, before this period, relatively few cultural productions reflected the lives of peasants and workers, and during the revolution, the struggles of workers, peasants, and revolutionary soldiers became frequent artistic subjects, often created by peasants and workers themselves. The spread of peasant paintings in rural China, for example, became one of the &quot;newborn things&quot; celebrated in a socialist society.

==== Film ====
The &quot;Four Hundred Films to be Criticized&quot; booklet was distributed, and film directors and actors/actresses were criticized with some tortured and imprisoned. These included many of Jiang Qing&#x27;s rivals and former friends. Those who died in the period included Cai Chusheng, Zheng Junli, Shangguan Yunzhu, Wang Ying, and Xu Lai. No feature films were produced in mainland China for seven years apart from a few approved &quot;Model dramas&quot; and highly ideological films. A notable example is &quot;Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy&quot;. China rejected Hollywood films and most foreign films. Albanian films and North Korean films developed mass audiences in China. In 1972, Chinese officials invited Michelangelo Antonioni to China to film the achievements of the Cultural Revolution. Antonioni made the documentary &quot;Chung Kuo, Cina&quot;. When it was released in 1974, CCP leadership in China interpreted the film as reactionary and anti-Chinese. Viewing art through the principles of the Yan&#x27;an Talks, particularly the concept that there is no such thing as art-for-art&#x27;s-sake, party leadership construed Antonioni&#x27;s aesthetic choices as politically motivated and banned the film.

Mobile film units brought Chinese cinema to the countryside and were crucial to the standardization and popularization of culture during this period, particularly including revolutionary model operas. During the Cultural Revolution&#x27;s early years, mobile film teams traveled to rural areas with news reels of Mao meeting with Red Guards and Tiananmen Square parades, which became known as &quot;red treasure films&quot;. The release of the filmed versions of the revolutionary model operas resulted in a re-organization and expansion of China&#x27;s film exhibition network. From 1965 to 1976, the number of film projection units in China quadrupled, total film audiences nearly tripled, and the national film attendance rate doubled. The Cultural Revolution Group drastically reduced ticket prices which, in its view, would allow film to better serve the needs of workers and of socialism.

===Historical sites===
China&#x27;s historical sites, artifacts and archives suffered devastating damage, as they were thought to be at the root of &quot;old ways of thinking&quot;. Artifacts were seized, museums and private homes ransacked, and any item found that was thought to represent bourgeois or feudal ideas was destroyed. Few records relate how much was destroyed—Western observers suggest that much of China&#x27;s thousands of years of history was in effect destroyed, or, later, smuggled abroad for sale. Chinese historians compare the suppression to Qin Shi Huang&#x27;s great Confucian purge. Religious persecution intensified during this period, as religion was viewed in opposition to Marxist–Leninist and Maoist thinking.

The destruction of historical relics was never formally sanctioned by the Party, whose official policy was instead to protect such items. On 14 May 1967, the Central Committee issued &quot;Several suggestions for the protection of cultural relics and books during the Cultural Revolution&quot;. Despite this, enormous damage was inflicted on China&#x27;s cultural heritage. For example, a survey in 1972 in Beijing of 18 cultural heritage sites, including the Temple of Heaven and Ming Tombs, showed extensive damage. Of the 80 cultural heritage sites in Beijing under municipal protection, 30 were destroyed, and of the 6,843 cultural sites under protection by Beijing government decision in 1958, 4,922 were damaged or destroyed. Numerous valuable old books, paintings, and other cultural relics were burnt.

Later archaeological excavation and preservation after the destructive period were protected, and several significant discoveries, such as the Terracotta Army and the Mawangdui, occurred after the peak of the Revolution. Nevertheless, the most prominent medium of academic research in archaeology, the journal &quot;Kaogu&quot;, did not publish. After the most violent phase, the attack on traditional culture continued in 1973 with the &quot;Anti-Lin Biao, Anti-Confucius Campaign&quot; as part of the struggle against moderate Party elements.

=== Media ===

During the early period of the Cultural Revolution, freedom of the press in China was at its peak. While the number of newspapers declined in this period, the number of independent publications by mass political organizations grew. According to China&#x27;s National Bureau of Statistics, the number of newspapers dropped from 343 in 1965, to 49 in 1966, and then to a 20th-century low of 43 in 1967. At the same time, the number of publications by mass organizations such as Red Guards grew to an estimated number as high as 10,000.

Independent political groups could publish broadsheets and handbills, as well as leaders&#x27; speeches and meeting transcripts which would normally have been considered highly classified. From 1966 to 1969, at least 5,000 new broadsheets by independent political groups were published. Several Red Guard organizations also operated independent printing presses to publish newspapers, articles, speeches, and big-character posters. For example, the largest student organization in Shanghai, the Red Revolutionaries, established a newspaper that had a print run of 800,000 copies by the end of 1966.

== Foreign relations ==

The functions of China&#x27;s embassies abroad were disrupted during the early part of the Cultural Revolution. In a 22 March 1969 meeting on the Sino-Soviet border clashes, Mao stated that in foreign relations, China was &quot;now isolated&quot; and &quot;we need to relax a little&quot;. Later that year, China began to restore its embassies to normal functioning. 

However, the Sino-Soviet conflict culminated in 1969, and according to declassified documents from both China and the United States, the Soviet Union planned to launch a large-scale nuclear strike on China after the Zhenbao Island incident in 1969. The planned targets include Beijing, Changchun, Anshan and China&#x27;s missile-launch centers of Jiuquan, Xichang and Lop Nur. This crisis almost led to a major nuclear war, seven years after the Cuban missile crisis. Eventually, the Soviet called off the attack due to the intervention from the United States.

China exported communist revolutions as well as communist ideologies to multiple countries in Southeast Asia, supporting parties in Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and in particular, the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia (responsible for the Cambodian genocide). It is estimated that at least 90% of the Khmer Rouge&#x27;s foreign aid came from China. In 1975 alone at least US$1 billion in interest-free economic and military aid and US$20 million came from China. China&#x27;s economic malaise impacted China&#x27;s ability to assist North Vietnam in its war against South Vietnam by the 1970s, which cooled relations between the once allied nations.

== Evaluations ==
On 27 June 1981, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party adopted the &quot;Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot;, an official assessment of major historical events since 1949. The Resolution declared that the Cultural Revolution was &quot;responsible for the most severe setback and the heaviest losses suffered by the people, the country, and the party since the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic.&quot; 

After the Cultural Revolution, a massive social and cultural movement known as the &quot;New Enlightenment&quot; took place in mainland China since the late 1970s. The movement lasted throughout the 1980s, and opposed the ideology of Cultural Revolution and feudalism. The New Enlightenment movement ended due to the Tiananmen Square protests and massacre in June 1989. After Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s southern tour in early 1992, however, intellectuals in mainland China became divided and formed two major schools of thought, the &quot;Liberalism&quot; and the &quot;New Left&quot;, which held different views on the Cultural Revolution. Meanwhile Maoist scholars hold another view. 

To this day, public discussion of the Cultural Revolution is still limited within mainland China. The Chinese government continues to prohibit news organizations from mentioning details, and online discussions and books about the topic are subject to official scrutiny. Textbooks abide by the &quot;official view&quot; of the events. Many government documents from the 1960s onward remain classified. Despite inroads by prominent sinologists, independent scholarly research is discouraged.

Mao Zedong&#x27;s legacy remains in some dispute. During the anniversary of his birth, many people viewed Mao as a godlike figure and referred to him as &quot;the people&#x27;s great savior&quot;. Contemporary discussions in the CCP-owned tabloid &quot;Global Times&quot; continue to glorify Mao. Rather than focus on consequences, state media newspapers claim that revolutions typically have a brutal side and are unable to be viewed from the &quot;humanitarian perspective&quot;. Critics of Mao Zedong look at the actions that occurred under his leadership from the point of view that &quot;he was better at conquering power than at ruling the country and developing a socialist economy&quot;. Mao went to extreme measures on his path to power, costing millions of lives then and during his rule.

<text>Qarshi ( ; ) is a city in southern Uzbekistan. It is the capital of Qashqadaryo Region. Administratively, Qarshi is a district-level city, that includes the urban-type settlement Qashqadaryo. It has a population of 278,300 (2021 estimate). It is about 520 km south-southwest of Tashkent, and about 335 km north of Uzbekistan&#x27;s border with Afghanistan. It is located at latitude 38° 51&#x27; 48N; longitude 65° 47&#x27; 52E at an altitude of 374 meters. The city is important in natural gas production, but Qarshi is also famous for its production of woven flat carpets.

==History==
Originally the Sogdian city of Nakhshab (which could be possibly named Eucratideia during the rule of Greco-Bactrian Kingdom), and the Islamic Uzbek (Turkic) city of Nasaf, and the Chagatay city of Qarshi (pronounced &quot;Kharsh&quot;), Qarshi was the second city of the Emirate of Bukhara. It is in the center of a fertile oasis that produces wheat, cotton, and silk and was a stop on the 11-day caravan route between Balkh and Bukhara. The Mongol Chagataid khans Kebek and Qazan built palaces here on the site of Chinggis Khaan&#x27;s summer pasture. In 1364, Timur also built a fortified palace with moats in what is now the southern part of the city. The modern name &quot;Qarshi&quot; means fort.

Qarshi developed steadily from the 14th century. During the Sheyban dynasty the town grew violently (16th century). It was the second largest town of Bukhara Khanate in the 18th century. During these centuries much of the city&#x27;s magnificent architectural monuments were built. With the decline of Shahrisabz in the 18th century, Qarshi grew in importance, and was the seat of the Crown Prince to the Emirate of Bukhara. The city had a double set of walls, 10 caravanserais and 4 madrassahs during this time. By 1868, the Russians had annexed the Zarafshan Valley, and in 1873, the treaty turning Bukhara into a Russian protectorate was signed in Qarshi, much to the dismay of the Emir&#x27;s son, Abdul Malik, who took to the hills in rebellion.

In the early 1970s, the first section of a major irrigation project was completed to divert water from the Amu Darya River in Turkmenistan eastward into Uzbekistan in order to irrigate the land surrounding Qarshi. Almost all of these irrigated lands around Qarshi are planted with cotton.

== Main sites ==

=== Odina Mosque ===

* Odina Mosque was built in the 16th century and is on the southeast side of Qarshi&#x27;s Eski Bazaar. The mosque was built on the site of an older Mongol palace, which had also been used as a prison. The mosque has an attractive domed exterior, and also a sardoba, a domed reservoir which stopped the water supply becoming contaminated or evaporating. It is no longer used for worship but instead houses Qarshi&#x27;s Regional Museum.

=== Madrassas ===

* There are three madrassas in Qarshi, all on the same square. These are the Kalizbek, Bakmir, and Khodjaev Abdul Aziz Madrasas, which were all built between 1904 and 1915. The madrassas no longer have a religious function and are in need of reservation, but tourists can enter inside if they ask the guardian.
* Rabiya Madrassah – a late 19th-century female madrassah

=== Kok Gumbaz Mosque ===

* Kok Gumbaz (which means &quot;blue dome&quot;) is Qarshi&#x27;s Friday Mosque. It is the largest such mosque in the region, and was constructed by Emperor Ulugbek on behalf of his father, Shah Rukh, in the late 16th century. Kok Gumbaz is architecturally quite similar to other Timurid mosques, including in Shakhrisabz, but it has been less heavily restored, so more of the original features remain intact.

=== Qarshi Bridge ===
* Qarshi Bridge is an ancient brick bridge built over the Qashqadaryo River, constructed in the second half of the 16th century.

=== World War II Memorial ===

* Qarshi&#x27;s war memorial to casualties of the Great Patriotic War is one of the largest Soviet era memorials in Central Asia. It is a mix of walkways, plaques, an eternal flame, and a red star-topped tower with a series of stained-glass windows. It is possible to access the upper levels of the memorial on request.

==Climate==
Köppen climate classification system classifies its climate as cold semi-arid (BSk).

==Industry==
A gas-to-liquids (GTL) plant, located 40 km south of Qarshi, is under construction. This plant will be based on Sasol’s GTL technology and will have a capacity of 1.4 million metric tons per year, with following product slate: GTL diesel, kerosene, naphtha and liquid petroleum gas. The total cost of the project is around $4 billion and it is the first such a high-tech plant on the Eurasian continent. The joint project GTL Uzbekistan, where Sasol and Uzbekistan&#x27;s state oil company Uzbekneftgas each hold 44.5% interest, and the rest 11% belonging to Malaysian Petronas, was founded in 2009. The plant will be built on the basis of the Shurtan gas and chemical complex.

==Culture==
===Sports===
Qarshi is home to FC Nasaf which was founded in 1986. Nasaf plays its home matches at the Markaziy Stadium, built in 2006.

==Education==

<text>The history of Jordan refers to the history of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the background period of the Emirate of Transjordan under British protectorate as well as the general history of the region of Transjordan.

There is evidence of human activity in Transjordan as early as the Paleolithic period. The area was settled by nomadic tribes in the Bronze Age, which consolidated in small kingdoms during the Iron Age – such as the Ammonites, Moabites and Edomites, with partial areas controlled by the Israelites. In the classic period, Transjordan came under Greek and later Roman influence. Under the Romans and the Byzantines, Transjordan was home to the Decapolis in the north, with much of the region being designated as Byzantine Arabia. Classical kingdoms located in the region of Transjordan, such as the Roman-era Nabatean kingdom, which had its capital at Petra, left particularly dramatic ruins popular today with tourists and filmmakers. The history of Transjordan continued with the Muslim empires starting in the 7th century, partial crusader control in the mid-Middle Ages (country of Oultrejordain) and finally, Mamluk rule from the 13th century and Ottoman rule between the 16th century and the First World War.

With the Great Arab Revolt in 1916 and the consequent British invasion, the area came under the Anglo-Arab ruled Occupied Enemy Territory Administration East in 1917, which was declared as the Arab Kingdom of Syria in 1920. Following the French occupation of only the northern part of the Syrian Kingdom, Transjordan was left in a period of interregnum. A few months later, Abdullah, the second son of Sharif Hussein, arrived in Transjordan. With the Transjordan memorandum to the Mandate for Palestine in the early 1920s, it became the Emirate of Transjordan under the Hashemite Emir. In 1946, independent Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan was formed and shortly admitted to the United Nations and the Arab League. In 1948, Jordan fought with the newly born state of Israel over lands of former Mandatory Palestine, effectively gaining control of the West Bank and annexing it with its Palestinian population. Jordan lost the West Bank in the 1967 War with Israel, and since became the central base of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in its struggle against Israel. The alliance between the PLO and the Jordanians, active during the War of Attrition, came to an end in the bloody Black September in Jordan in 1970, when a civil war between Jordanians and Palestinians (with Syrian Ba&#x27;athist support) took thousands of lives. In the aftermath, the defeated PLO was forced out of Jordan together with tens of thousands of its fighters and their Palestinian families, relocating to South Lebanon.

==Stone Age==

Evidence of human activity in Jordan dates back to the Paleolithic period. While there is no architectural evidence from this era, archaeologists have found tools, such as flint and basalt hand-axes, knives and scraping implements.

In the Neolithic period (8500–4500 BC) three major shifts occurred. First, people became sedentary, living in small villages, and discovering and domesticating new food sources such as cereal grains, peas and lentils, as well as goats. The human population increased to tens of thousands.

Second, this shift in settlement pattern appears to have been catalyzed by a marked change in climate. The eastern desert, in particular, grew warmer and drier, eventually to the point where it became uninhabitable for most of the year. This watershed climate change is believed to have occurred between 6500 and 5500 BC.

Third, beginning sometime between 5500 and 4500 BC, the inhabitants began to make pottery from clay rather than plaster. Pottery-making technologies were probably introduced to the area by craftsmen from Mesopotamia.

The largest Neolithic site in Jordan is at Ein Ghazal in Amman. The many buildings were divided into three distinct districts. Houses were rectangular and had several rooms, some with plastered floors. Archaeologists have unearthed skulls covered with plaster and with bitumen in the eye sockets at sites throughout Jordan, Israel, the Palestinian Territories and Syria. A statue discovered at Ein Ghazal is thought to be 8,000 years old. Just over one meter high, it depicts a woman with huge eyes, skinny arms, knobby knees and a detailed rendering of her toes.

==Chalcolithic==

During the Chalcolithic period (4500–3200 BC), copper began to be smelted and used to make axes, arrowheads and hooks. The cultivation of barley, dates, olives and lentils, and the domestication of sheep and goats, rather than hunting, predominated. The lifestyle in the desert was probably very similar to that of modern Bedouins.

Tuleitat Ghassul is a large Chalcolithic era village located in the Jordan Valley. The walls of its houses were made of sun-dried mud bricks; its roofs of wood, reeds and mud. Some had stone foundations, and many had large central courtyards. The walls are often painted with bright images of masked men, stars, and geometric motifs, which may have been connected to religious beliefs.

==Bronze Age==

Many of the villages built during the Early Bronze Age (3200–1950 BC) included simple water infrastructures, as well as defensive fortifications probably designed to protect against raids by neighboring nomadic tribes.

At Bab al-Dhra in Wadi `Araba, archaeologists discovered more than 20,000 shaft tombs with multiple chambers as well as houses of mud-brick containing human bones, pots, jewelry and weapons. Hundreds of dolmens scattered throughout the mountains have been dated to the late Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Ages.

Although writing was developed before 3000 BC in Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was generally not used in Jordan, Canaan and Syria until some thousand years later, even though archaeological evidence indicates that the inhabitants of Transjordan were trading with Egypt and Mesopotamia.

Between 2300 and 1950 BC, many of the large, fortified hilltop towns were abandoned in favor of either small, unfortified villages or a pastoral lifestyle. There is no consensus on what caused this shift, though it is thought to have been a combination of climatic and political changes that brought an end to the city-state network.

During the Middle Bronze Age (1950–1550 BC), migration across the Middle East increased. Trading continued to develop between Egypt, Syria, Arabia, and Canaan including Transjordan, resulting in the spread of technology and other hallmarks of civilization. Bronze, forged from copper and tin, enabled the production of more durable axes, knives, and other tools and weapons. Large, distinct communities seem to have arisen in northern and central Jordan, while the south was populated by a nomadic, Bedouin-type of people known as the Shasu.

New fortifications appeared at sites like Amman&#x27;s Citadel, Irbid, and Tabaqat Fahl (or Pella). Towns were surrounded by ramparts made of earth embankments, and the slopes were covered in hard plaster, making the climb slippery and difficult. Pella was enclosed by massive walls and watch towers.

Archaeologists usually date the end of the Middle Bronze Age to about 1550 BC, when the Hyksos were driven out of Egypt during the 17th and 18th Dynasties. A number of Middle Bronze Age towns in Canaan including Transjordan were destroyed during this time.

==Iron Age==
During the Iron Age (1200–332 BC), Transjordan was home to the Kingdoms of Ammon, Edom and Moab. The peoples of these kingdoms spoke Semitic languages of the Canaanite group; their polities are considered to be tribal kingdoms rather than states. Ammon was located in the Amman plateau, and its capital was Rabbath Ammon; Moab was located in the highlands east of the Dead Sea with the capital at Kir of Moab (Kerak); and Edom in the area around Wadi Araba in the south, with the capital at Bozrah. The northwestern region of the Transjordan, known then as Gilead, was inhabited by the Israelites. According to the Bible, the Transjordan was home to the Israelite tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.

The Transjordanian kingdoms of Ammon, Edom and Moab continually clashed with the neighboring Hebrew kingdoms of Israel and Judah, centered west of the Jordan River. One record of this is the Mesha Stele, erected by the Moabite king Mesha in 840 BC; on it he lauds himself for the building projects that he initiated in Moab and commemorates his glory and victory against the Israelites. The stele, found in Dhiban in 1868, constitutes one of the most important archeological parallels of accounts recorded in the Bible; the biblical narrative of the war is recorded in 2 Kings .

At the same time, Israel and the Kingdom of Aram-Damascus competed for control of the Gilead. Around 720 BC Israel and Aram Damascus were conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Meanwhile, the kingdoms of Ammon, Edom and Moab benefited from trade between Syria and Arabia. In 701 BC, they submitted to the Assyrians to avoid retribution. Babylonians took over the Assyrians&#x27; empire after its disintegration in 627 BC. Although the kingdoms supported the Babylonians against Judah in the 597 BC sack of Jerusalem, they rebelled against Babylon a decade later. The kingdoms were reduced to vassals, a status they retained under the Persian and Hellenic Empires. 

==Classical period==
Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquest of the Persian Empire in 332 BC introduced Hellenistic culture to the Middle East. After Alexander&#x27;s death in 323 BC, the empire split among his generals, and in the end much of Transjordan was disputed between the Ptolemies based in Egypt and the Seleucids based in Syria. By the late Hellenistic period, the area had a mixed population of Jews, Greeks, Nabataeans, other Arabs, and descendants of Ammonites. One of the best surviving structures from that period is Qasr al-Abd, a Hellenistic palace built by the Jewish Tobiad family, close to the village of Iraq al-Amir.The Nabataeans, nomadic Arabs based south of Edom, managed to establish an independent kingdom in the southern parts of Jordan in 169 BC by exploiting the struggle between the two Greek powers. The Jewish Hasmonean Kingdom also took advantage of the growing geopolitical vacuum, seizing the area east of the Jordan River valley. The Nabataean Kingdom gradually expanded to control much of the trade routes of the region, and it stretched south along the Red Sea coast into the Hejaz desert, up to as far north as Damascus, which it controlled for a short period (85–71) BC. The Nabataeans massed a fortune from their control of the trade routes, often drawing the envy of their neighbours. They also had monopolistic control over the Dead Sea. Petra, Nabataea&#x27;s barren capital, flourished in the 1st century AD, driven by its extensive water irrigation systems and agriculture. The Nabataeans were also talented stone carvers, building their most elaborate structure, Al-Khazneh, in the first century AD. It is believed to be the mausoleum of the Arab Nabataean King Aretas IV.

Roman legions under Pompey conquered much of the Levant in 63 BC, inaugurating a period of Roman rule that lasted four centuries.name=&quot;roman2&quot;&gt; The eastern side of the Jordan River valley, known then as Perea, was part of the Herodian Kingdom of Judea, a vassal state of the Roman Empire. By this time, the kingdoms of Ammon, Edom and Moab lost their distinct identities, and were assimilated into the Roman culture. Some Edomites survived longer - driven by the Nabataeans due to sedition, they had migrated to southern Judea, which became known as Idumaea; They were later converted to Judaism by the Hasmoneans. However, it is likely that Edomite migration to southern Judea has an older history, dating back to Nebuchadnezzar II&#x27;s reign.

The area also became the setting for some important events in Christianity, including the Baptism of Jesus. In 106 AD, Emperor Trajan annexed the Nabataean Kingdom unopposed, and rebuilt the King&#x27;s Highway which became known as the Via Traiana Nova road. The Romans gave the Greek cities of Transjordan–Philadelphia (Amman), Gerasa (Jerash), Gedara (Umm Quays), Pella (Tabaqat Fahl) and Arbila (Irbid)–and other Hellenistic cities in Palestine and southern Syria, a level of autonomy by forming the &quot;Decapolis&quot;, a ten-city league. Jerash is one of the best preserved Roman cities in the East; it was even visited by Emperor Hadrian during his journey to Syria Palaestina.

In 324 AD, the Roman Empire split, and the Eastern Roman Empire–later known as the Byzantine Empire–continued to control or influence the region until 636 AD. Christianity had become legal within the empire in 313 AD after Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity. The Edict of Thessalonka made Christianity the official state religion in 380 AD. Transjordan prospered during the Byzantine era, and Christian churches were built everywhere. The Aqaba Church in Ayla was built during this era, it is considered to be the world&#x27;s first purpose built Christian church. Umm ar-Rasas in southern Amman contains at least 16 Byzantine churches. Meanwhile, Petra&#x27;s importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, and after a 363 earthquake destroyed many structures, it declined further, eventually being abandoned. The Sassanian Empire in the east became the Byzantines&#x27; rivals, and frequent confrontations sometimes led to the Sassanids controlling some parts of the region, including Transjordan.

==Middle Ages==

In the early 7th century, the area of modern Jordan became integrated into the new Arab-Islamic Umayyad Empire (the first Muslim dynasty), which ruled much of the Middle East from 661 until 750 AD. At the time, Amman, today the capital of the Kingdom of Jordan, became a major town in &quot;Jund Dimashq&quot; (the military district of Damascus, itself a subsection of the Bilad al-Sham province), and became the seat of the provincial governor. Incidentally, there was also a &quot;Jund al-Urdunn&quot; (&quot;Realm of Jordan&quot;) district, but that encompassed a more northerly area than modern Jordan.

Under the Umayyad&#x27;s successors, the Abbasids (750–1258), Jordan was neglected and began to languish due to the geopolitical shift that occurred when the Abassids moved their capital from Damascus to Kufa and later to Baghdad.

After the decline of the Abbasids, parts of Jordan were ruled by various powers and empires including the Crusaders, the Ayyubids, the Mamluks as well as the Ottomans, who captured most of the Arab world around 1517.

==Ottoman rule==
=== Early Ottoman Period ===
The levant, which has been in Mamluk control since 1250 and specifically the Burji dynasty since 1382 was lost to the Ottomans after their victory in the Battle of Marj Dabiq that ended with the killing of the ruling Qansuh al-Ghuri in August 1516. Initially, the Ottomans didn&#x27;t interfere much east of the Jordan river, but the increased trade activity passing through Jordan and their new responsibilities towards the Hajj soon caused the establishment of a Government in Al-Karak and a Garrison in Al Shobak. Agricultural villages in Jordan witnessed a period of relative prosperity in the 16th century, benefiting from the stability and administrative structures the Ottomans brought. The region saw tribes vie for regional hegemony, as in contrast to other regions such as Palestine or Damascus, the Jordanian territory would have less Ottoman oversight, and at times virtually absent and reduced to annual tax collection visits. This allowed the tribes in the area to have much more autonomy. The Ottoman period would see the power players inside Jordan which were the Bani Amr-Banu Oqbah, the Mihaydat, and Al-Fadl, be replaced roughly by Al-Majali, Al-Fayez-Bani Sakher, and the Adwan respectively.

=== Arrival of the Bani Sakher and the Adwan ===
Around the end of the 16th century, a portion of the ancient tribes of Bani Sakher and of the Suwiet clan of the Bani Dhafir, both descendants of Tayy, were heading northwards, with the Sakherites migrating from their ancestral home of Al Ula and the Dhafirites leaving also from an area close to Medina. The Bani Sakher have up until then been roaming the areas from south of Al Ula to as far north as the Golan Heights, and as far East as Fayum in Egypt since at least the Early Mamluk age, but the migration that was about to occur was more permanent and significant in nature. Enmity between the two migrating tribes would soon begin as they collided in battle in Southern Jordan which resulted in a decisive victory for the Bani Sakher. The Dhafir&#x27;s would flee to Al Azraq where the Bani Sakher tracked them and battle with them again, decimating their forces and killing their Sheikh, Sultan Al-Suwiet. After this defeat, the tribe would split into two, one continued eastwards into Iraq, and the other remained in Jordan, going westwards and become the ancestors of the Adwan tribe. The Bani Sakher also collided with the Wuld Ali Anazzah on the way who migrated northwards at the same time, the battle ended with a Bani Sakher victory and would set the stage for further enmities between the two tribes later in the 18th century.

=== Al-Majali of Al-Karak ===
Around the year 1565, the Tamimi tribe, well established in Al-Karak at the time, raised a rebellion which proved too costly to send a regular force to quench. Lala Mustafa Pasha, Wali of Damascus at the time, asked for Yusuf Al-Nimer of Nablus&#x27;s aide. Al-Nimer marched on Al-Karak with his forces and captured Al-Karak, fleeing the Tamimi to their relatives in Hebron, the Al-Tamimi who left Al-Karak were now nicknamed Al-Majali and it became their family name. He left behind some of the forces with one of his brothers, who held the area until a Turkish Ottoman governor arrived. The following period would see Al-Karak have a balanced power balance between the Turks, the Aghawat (the descendants of Yusuf&#x27;s brother who remained), and the Emiri Banu Oqbah tribe of Banu Harb that held power in Al-Karak since the Mamluk age. 60 years later, after the death of Omar Agha Al-Nimr, Jalal Ibn Shadid Al-Majali went back to Al-Karak.

=== Struggle for the Hauran and Ahl Al-Shamal confederacy ===
The Hauran, a region extending from northern Suwayda to Northeast Al Mafraq in Jordan, alongside the Wadi Al-Azraq, commonly named as Wadi Al-Sirhan after the tribe, were some of the most coveted fertile grazing lands for Arab tribes up until the modern era. The Sirhan tribe, was the paramount tribe in both regions and lead a confederacy called Ahl Al-Shamal (people of the north) which included other tribes like the Al Issa and the Al Fheili. The neighboring tribe of Al Sardiya, led by Muhammed Al-Mheidi, attacked the Sirhan tribe near Damascus and killing their sheikh Shafi Al Sirhan circa 1650. The Sardiya would claim the Hauran and the Wadi as their own and would rule the region very strictly. The Al Issa and the Al Fheili deserted and would ally with the new lords, leading the Sirhan to migrate to the Al-Jawf region and not counterattack.

=== Anazah Invasion and Bani Sakher wars ===

The end of the 17th century saw the Wuld Ali tribe of the Anazah confederation, led by their paramount sheikhs Al-Tayyar and Ibn Smeir, began migrating deeper northwards out of Khaybar and into the Jawf region, which the Sirhan now inhabited. The Anazeh intended on violent conquest and would siege the Sirhan in the Jawf, reportedly causing a mass starvation for the tribe. At the time the Bani Sakher the two halves of the Bani Sakher, headed by the Al-Fayez and the Khreisha, would regularly camp in the Beersheba and Gaza districts respectively. A Bani Sakher tribesmen left the sieged area and informed the Sheikh Sulayman Al-Khreisha of the Bani Sakher who was camped in the Gaza, as I&#x27;dbeys Al-Fayez was involved with a conflict with the Emir of Beersheba at the time that led to the Emir&#x27;s death. Al-Khreisha rode from Gaza to the Jawf, gathering the Bani Sakher forces on the way, and broke the Anazah siege on the Sirhan. However the Anazah kept pursuing the two tribes and led the tribes to flee to the northwards. This pushed the Bani Sakher, with their new allies the Sirhan, further north into Jordan and into Sardiya territory. The Bani Sakher and the Anazzah would however maintain political ties, especially in raiding such as the Hajj Caravan raids of 1700 and 1703.

Around the year 1720, a ploy set up by Sheikh I&#x27;dbeys Al-Fayez and Sheikh Sulayman Al Khreisha of the Bani Sakher succeeded against the Mahfuz (chief) of the Sardiya. This event would see the Bani Sakher&#x27;s number of horsemen rise greatly, and would permanently damage the prestige of the Sardiya. The Al-Fayez were soon bestowed as commanders of the Hajj Caravans as the most capable tribe in defending them. In one of the following years, the Anazah battled the Sardiya in Muyzarib, a village northeast of Irbid, and would kill their Sheikh and end the Ahl Al Shamal Confederacy. After which the Bani Sakher, Sirhan, Sardiya, Al Issa, Al Fheili, and some minor tribes would take refuge in Palestine, while the tribes that remained agreed to a Khawa or a tax to be paid to their new Anazah overlords. Al Fheili would permanently settle in Palestinian cities as land tillers and gave up their Bedouin status. For the majority of the rest of the century, the Anazah would rule large swathes of modern-day eastern Jordan, from the Hauran to the Jawf, and occasionally the Balqa region and its surrounding regions.

The Bani Sakher, having lost many of its lands in the east, would set their attention to their western lands in the Balqa and Al-Karak and would even get involved in Palestinian power struggles and politics for the rest of the 18th century. In 1730 they challenged Adwan dominance in the Balqa and were established enough in the Balqa to not pay to graze on Adwani lands. In the 1750s they extended their influence deeper into Al-Karak and imposed Khawa on many tribes of Al-Karak including the Tarawna, Dhmur, Atawna, Sarayra, Nawaysa, Maayta, Habashna, and the Christians of Al-Karak. Both of these expansions were under I&#x27;dbeys Al-Fayez&#x27;s, which began a rivalry between the Bani Sakher and the Majali to their south and the Bani Sakher and the Adwan to their north.

In 1757, owing to a missed payment by the Ottomans to the Bani Sakher for their help in the siege of Tiberias and a drought in the previous year, Qa&#x27;dan, I&#x27;dbeys&#x27;s brother and successor, attacked the advance guard of the Hajj caravan under the Ottoman command Musa Pasha in Al-Qatranah. Husayn Pasha had also been alerted of the advance guard&#x27;s plunder and the relief guard&#x27;s dispersal, and attempted to reach out to Sheikh Qa&#x27;dan. The Wali of Damascus Husayn Pasha sent representatives who offered Sheikh Qa&#x27;dan to negotiate for safe passage to Damascus but were refused. This led to the Hajj Caravan Raid of 1757 which had reverberating effects across the entire Ottoman Empire and greatly affected the Empire&#x27;s prestige.

=== Adwan rise to power ===
Around 1640, the dynamics of power within the Belqa District began to shift dramatically with the arrival of two brothers, Fayez and Fauzan of the Al Dhafir tribe, who sought refuge with the Al Kinda tribe near Jebel Samik. The death of Fauzan shortly after their arrival left Fayez to integrate into the local tribal hierarchy through a pivotal marriage to the daughter of the Sheikh of Kinda. This union bore a son named Adwan, who would later forge an alliance through marriage with a daughter of the Mihdawiya sheikhs, thereby knitting together significant tribal relations that would lay the groundwork for future confrontations and territorial expansions.

Adwan&#x27;s son, Hamdan, became a notable figure in these tribal narratives, distinguishing himself through a successful raid on a caravan traveling from northern Iraq to Mecca. The raid, which occurred as the caravan crossed the stream at Al Zarqa, not only bolstered Hamdan&#x27;s reputation but also resulted in the acquisition of a she-camel named &quot;Al Zabta,&quot; a prize that would become a war cry for the Adwan. Over time, Hamdan&#x27;s ambition and growing discontent with his master, Jaudat, the Mihdawiya Emir, drove him to secretly amass a loyal group of followers known as the Al Qradha, or &quot;The Borrowed.&quot; This group proved pivotal in Hamdan&#x27;s strategies, remaining loyal throughout the ensuing turbulent periods.

The tension between Hamdan and Jaudat escalated to a breaking point when Jaudat&#x27;s oppressive demands led to a revolt, sparked by an incident where a tribesman was forced to substitute for an ox in plowing fields. This revolt, smoldering over two decades, eventually led to Hamdan&#x27;s death. His sons, however, continued the struggle, leveraging the Mihdawiya Amir&#x27;s controversial attempt to forcibly marry the daughter of a Christian priest from Al Fheis. This situation presented an opportunity for the Adwan to strategically intervene by allying with the Al Ajarmah tribe and setting a trap for Jaudat under the guise of a reconciliatory wedding feast in Al Fheis. The resulting ambush was deadly; Jaudat and several of his men were killed, a pivotal moment still commemorated by Al Mihdawi&#x27;s tree in the village.

In the aftermath, Jaudat&#x27;s son, Dhamman, unable to maintain control, retreated with his followers to the Ghors al-Kafrain, Al Rameh, and Al Shunnet Nimrin, effectively ceding significant upland territories to the Adwan. Adwan bin Hamdan who succeeded his father capitalized on this retreat by pursuing Dhaman&#x27;s son, Mashhur, to the modern Dharset Mashhur, where Mashhur was killed. The victory allowed Adwan to consolidate control over the Ghor, distributing the newly acquired lands among his sons and relatives, at the cost of Dhamman who took refuge at the Balawna tribe. His eldest son, Kayid, received the comparatively smaller Ghor al-Rameh and was encouraged to further expand territory by challenging Dhamman and the Balawna.

The battle that followed, taking place at the banks of the Zarqa stream, was costly; Kayid was mortally wounded, and significant losses were suffered. Despite these setbacks, the Adwan, reinforced by their allies, the Qradha, advanced again, decisively defeating the Balawna and driving the Mihdawiya further north, beyond Beisan and into the Ajlun District. This series of conflicts not only solidified Adwan control over the Belqa but also marked the decline of the Mihdawiya as a regional power by 1750, now under Kayid&#x27;s brother, Diyab.

Hostilities soon arose between the Al-Adwan and Zahir Al Omar, the latter sent a force under Qasim Al-Said to attack Al-Adwan and successfully captured Al-Salt in 1760, and leading the Diyab and his followers to flee to Al-Karak. Salih, Diyab&#x27;s brother, remained on his lands and would stage a successful raid on a caravan loaded with weapons sent from Nablus to Al-Said. Al-Said turned his attention to Salih but was defeated at Al Ghor, with Salih seizing the chieftainship of the Adwan and the Balqa from Diyab. A succession crisis followed, with Diyab&#x27;s failed attempt at battling his brother, he asked for Turkish help which led Salih to stay inside Al Salt. Salih failed to recognize the contempt that the urbanites of Al Salt had for the Adwan and was captured and executed, with his head sent to the Turks as a gift. Diyab regained his position momentarily until another revolt caused his death and the Adwan to flee to Jabal Al Druze for half a year, coming back under the leadership of the famous poet Nimr Al-Adwan.

=== Majali rise to power in Al-Karak ===
Upon Jalal&#x27;s arrival, Al-Karak was dominated by two influential factions: the Imamiya, descendants of Turkish officials, and the Amr, who traced their lineage back to Banu Oqbah of Harb, a participant in the historic defeat at Mu&#x27;tah in 629. The Majali remained relatively obscure until Salim, Jalal&#x27;s grandson, rose to prominence as the Chief of the tribe. Salim was instrumental in leveraging the internal strife between the Imamiya and the Amr. Around the year 1700, Salim, sensing an opportunity, allied with the Amr to confront the Imamiya during a large feast at the Bairam festival. An ambush was organized near the west gate of Al-Karak; the signal for attack—a white flag—was raised if the feast included an ox, indicating the presence of numerous Imamiya leaders. When this signal was confirmed, Salim and his 25 men launched a decisive attack, annihilating the Imamiya&#x27;s presence in Al-Karak.

The leadership of Al-Karak then passed to Muhammed Ibn Salim, and then to Hamad, who engaged

the Amr over land disputes near Mezar. Using traditional boundary-setting techniques, Hamad managed to expand Majali territory significantly, a crucial step in securing the tribe&#x27;s future prosperity. Salim ibn Muhammed succeeded his brother Hamad and sought the support of neighboring tribes such as the Bani Hamida, the Hajaya, and the Bani Sakhr, with which Salim successfully expelled the Amr from Al-Karak. However, the victory was bittersweet as the allied tribes demanded their share of the spoils, leading to continued strife and tributes imposed on various groups within the region, with the Bani Sakher levying khawa on most of the tribes in Al-Karak.

Khalil Majali, succeeding Salim around 1760. The Majali&#x27;s dominance was challenged during a severe famine of 1779 when Khalil, who controlled the local grain supplies planned to leverage the famine to acquire land from desperate locals . However, his plans were disrupted when Salim&#x27;s grandson Yusef ibn Sulayman Majali, responding to the community&#x27;s urgent needs, led a grain caravan from Jerusalem back to Al-Karak. Despite attempts by Khalil to intercept and rob the caravan, Yusef&#x27;s diplomatic skills ensured its safe passage, which earned him great favor with the local Al-Karaki people.

Khalil&#x27;s death soon after marked another pivotal moment for the Majali. Yusef, who was very popular in Al-Karak was elected head of the tribe. He invited the Amr back to Al-Karak in 1804 to strategically incite conflict with the Bani Hamida, ultimately leading to the Amr&#x27;s expulsion once again. Yusef then incited the Al-Karaki&#x27;s to attack the Bani Hamida, blaming them for the misfortunes and wars of the region. After a successful attack, Yusef seized the fertile lands north of Al-Karak for himself, securing Majali power and riches in Al Al-Karak.

=== Al-Fayez Period ===
The Beni Sakher under Awad bin Thiab Al-Fayez reinstated the Ahl Al-Shamal confederacy at the beginning of the 19th century with Al Sirhan, Al Sardiya, and the Al Issa as junior tribes, and would raid the Wuld Ali Anazah from Palestine and the Balwa for many decades, until their gradual weakening, ending with the Bani Sakher regaining their lands to the east. The Wuld Ali Anazah were finally pushed out and northwards into Al Mafraq. Around that time, in 1803 the Wahhabi&#x27;s began occupying lands in Southern Jordan, until they reached Al-Karak in 1808. The Karakis, under Yusuf Al-Majali, refused to pay the Wahhabis, which might&#x27;ve been the reason for Ibn Sa&#x27;ud conferring on title of &quot;Emir of all the Bedouins to the south of Damascus, as far as the Red Sea.&quot; on Yusuf. This title would prove to be short-lived as by 1812 the Bani Sakher were so overwhelming that they defeated the joint-forces of the Adwan, the Wali of Damascus Sulayman Pasha, and the newly arrived but powerful Ruwalla tribe to occupy and seize the Balqa and flee the Adwan to Ajloun where Al Freihat and Al Schreideh were the paramount powers. A power struggle between Al Freihat and al Schreideh allowed the Bani Sakher to extend further into Jabal Ajloun. In the same year, Johann L. Burckhardt would become the first westerner to see the ancient city of Petra in over a thousand years. In 1820, a battle took place between the Bani Sakher, now led by a young Fendi Al-Fayez and the Adwan led by Diyab and their allies the Bani Hassan north of the Balqa where &quot;much blood was spilt&quot;.

In 1822, Syria was ceded to Ismail Pasha and the growing Muhammad Ali dynasty in Egypt, however rule of the tribes still remained lax and more powerful tribes would see the say autonomy during this period. In 1825, the Al-Freihat and their allies sided with the Adwan and their Balqa coalition which included a list of tribes in Al Qradha and the Bani Hassan, successfully pushed the Bani Sakher out of Jabal Ajloun. In 1833 Ibrahim Pasha turned on the Ottomans and established his rule, whose oppressive policies led to the unsuccessful Peasants&#x27; revolt in Palestine in 1834. Jordanian cities of Al-Salt and Al-Karak were destroyed by Ibrahim Pasha&#x27;s forces for harboring a fled Palestinian revolt leader. Egyptian rule was forcibly ended in 1841 with the help of western intervention, the Ottoman rule was restored. The middle of the 18th century so the rapid expansion

of the Bani Sakher, under now Emir Fendi Al-Fayez who has seemingly overshadowed his Khreisha counterpart and would gain effective control of the whole tribe. In 1848, an expedition by American Naval Officer William Lynch had him encounter the Bani Sakher during negotiations with Aqil Agha. Already by then, Lynch, noted that the tribe at this point was the most powerful force east of the Jordan, and that Fendi Al-Fayez was referred to as prince, and his son and successor Sattam as the young prince. Around this time Fendi would send Sattam as an emissary to Muhammad Ali Pasha of Egypt bearing horses for gifts.

During that period, the tribe succeeded in establishing vassalage over a significant number of tribes and villages across Jordan, including Al Sardiya, Al Sirhan, Bani Abbad, Bani Hamida, and notably, the influential Majali. The vassalizing of Al-Karak and the Majalis under the sway of Al-Fayez was notably documented in 1863 by Italian explorer Carlo Guarmani.

A pivotal event in these power dynamics involved the Majalli family, detailed in Carlo Guarmani&#x27;s account in his book, &quot;Northern Nejd&quot;. The villagers of Al Tafilah, traditionally under the jurisdiction of Mohammad Al-Majalli and accustomed to paying annual tributes, expressed dissatisfaction with the Majalis&#x27; dwindling protection. Led by Abdullah Al-Huara, chief of Al Tafilah, they collectively decided to renounce their vassal status, proposing instead to offer yearly gifts as a token of homage. This shift did not sit well with the Al-Majalli chief, who intended to reassert control. However, intervention by the Bani Sakher, under the leadership of Fendi, whose diplomatic efforts led to a compromise that averted immediate conflict.

The tension resurfaced in January 1864 when Al-Majalli sought to reclaim authority over Tafilah. This move triggered a formal declaration of war from Fendi. Shlash Al-Bakhit Al-Fayez led a successful tactical assault against Qoblan Al-Mkheisen, appointed by Al-Majalli to manage Tafilah. In response, Fendi deployed 200 warriors who faced a formidable opposition of 2000 riflemen mounted on dromedaries. As the standoff prolonged, the people of Al-Kerak found themselves in an effective state of siege, grappling with food shortages and growing discontent. In a strategic move, Al-Majalli covertly approached Fendi under the cover of night to formally concede defeat, agreeing to make amends to those affected by the hostilities, including reinstating Al-Huara&#x27;s son as the Chief of Al-Tafilah. This resolution solidified Al-Fayez&#x27;s influential role in mediating and resolving tribal conflicts, further instated their leadership and diplomatic prowess in the region.Around the late 1860s Fendi began sharing many of his responsibilities with his son Sattam, who would become the first tribal Sheikh in Jordan since the early Mamluk age to focus on administration, agriculture, and state-building in Jordan outside the urban centers of Al Salt and Al Karak. A formal alliance was struck between the Bani Sakher and the Adwan since the beginning of their hostilities in the 1620s, with the marriage of Alia, the sister of Ali ibn Diyab Al Adwan, to Sattam. Henry Tristram&#x27;s expedition to the area was right after this marriage, and he was guided by Sheikh Sattam Al-Fayez around much of the country in a 3-month journey, showing signs of much greater stability than what was the case in the previous centuries. Al-Fayez would introduce Henry to the Moabite stone which was in the vassal Bani Hamida lands. The stone was a great discovery, and after strained negotiations it was finally sent to Paris where it now resides in the Louvre.

The alliance between the Bani Sakher and the Adwan posed a threat to the Ottoman administration, preceding the Great Arab Revolt by half a century. The mid-1860s would see the Ottomans send multiple forces under Mehmet Rashid Pasha in 1867 into the Adwan lands. The Ottomans instated Mohammad Sa&#x27;id Agha as the governor of the Balqa which greatly affected Adwan prestige. Another force was sent against the Adwan who were supported by the Adwan, culminating in another defeat and forcing the Adwan to pay 225,000 piasters as a fine. Another force sent by Rashid Pasha into the Bani Sakher lands in 1869 but the area was too costly to maintain for the Ottomans due to the frequency of attacks.

Russian persecution of Sunni Muslim Circassians in Circassia, forced their immigration into the region in 1867, where they today form a small part of the country&#x27;s ethnic fabric. Oppression and neglect for the people of the region forced the population to decline, the only people left were nomadic Bedouins. Urban settlements with small populations included; Al-Salt, Irbid, Jerash and Al-Karak. What added to the under-development of the urban life in Jordan was the fact that the settlements were raided by the Bedouins as a source of living, the urbanites had to pay them to stay

safe.

The Circassians, supported by the Ottomans, were resettled in Amman, which was a huge loss to the prestige and riches of Adwan. In a balancing act the Ottomans then resettled the Christians of Al Karak which have been paying tribute to the Al-Fayez since 1750 in Madaba, the stronghold of Al-Fayez. This greatly angered Sheikh Sattam who was by now the effectively the paramount Sheikh of the Bani Sakher. Sattam first protested, and with the Ottoman&#x27;s firm resolution, resorted to violence in order to drive them out. Instead of a prolonged battle, the Ottomans appeased the young Emir by officially giving him the office of Emir Al Jizah, which included the titles Bey and Agha.

=== Late Ottoman Period ===
Ottoman oppression provoked a revolt, Most notably the Shoubak revolt and the Karak revolt, they were only suppressed with great difficulty.

==Emirate of Transjordan==


After four centuries of stagnant and many times nominal Ottoman rule (1516–1918), Turkish control over Transjordan came to an end during World War I when the Hashemite Army of the Great Arab Revolt, took over and secured present-day Jordan with the help and support of the region&#x27;s local Bedouin tribes, Circassians, and Christians. The revolt was launched by the Hashemites and led by Sharif Hussein of Mecca against the Ottoman Empire. The revolt was supported by the Allies of World War I, including Britain and France. Sharif Hussein&#x27;s sons, Faisal and Abdullah, were promised territorial rule in return.

With the break-up of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I, the League of Nations and the occupying powers, Britain and France, redrew the borders of the Middle East. Their decisions, most notably the Sykes–Picot Agreement, led to the establishment of the French Mandate for Syria and British Mandate for Palestine. The latter included the territory of Transjordan, which had been already allocated to Abdullah approximately a year prior to the finalization of the Mandate document (the Mandate officially introduced in 1923).

One reason was that the British government had at that point to find a role for Abdullah, after his brother Faisal had lost his control in Syria. Jordan had been a &quot;staging area&quot; for Faisal&#x27;s and the Arab nationalists&#x27; attempted takeover of Syria in 1918, which was ultimately defeated by the French. Following this, Transjordan was left in a period of interregnum. A few months later, Abdullah, the second son of Sharif Hussein, arrived into Transjordan. Faisal was subsequently given the role of the king of Iraq and the British made Abdullah emir of the newly created Transjordanian state. At first, Abdullah was displeased with the territory given to him, and hoped it was only a temporary allocation, to be replaced by Syria or Palestine. Historian Joseph Massad has described the founding of Jordan as a state in 1921 as &quot;a hesitant act by its architects, the British and the Hashemites.&quot;

The Permanent Court of International Justice and an International Court of Arbitration established by the Council of the League of Nations handed down rulings in 1925 which determined that Palestine and Transjordan were newly created successor states of the Ottoman Empire as defined by international law.

The most serious threats to Emir Abdullah&#x27;s position in Transjordan were repeated Wahhabi incursions from Najd into southern parts of his territory. The emir was powerless to repel those raids by himself, thus the British maintained a military base, with a small air force, at Marka, close to Amman.

In 1928, Britain officially provided King Abdullah with full autonomy, though the British RAF continued to provide security to the emirate.

The Emirate of Transjordan had a population of 200,000 in 1920, 225,000 in 1922 and 400,000 (as Kingdom) in 1948. Almost half of the population in 1922 (around 103,000) was nomadic.

==Kingdom of Transjordan/Jordan==
===Establishment===
On 17 January 1946 the British Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, announced in a speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations that the British Government intended to take steps in the near future to establish Transjordan as a fully independent and sovereign state. The Treaty of London was signed by the British Government and the Emir of Transjordan on 22 March 1946 as a mechanism to recognise the full independence of Transjordan upon ratification by both countries&#x27; parliaments. Transjordan&#x27;s impending independence was recognized on April 18, 1946, by the League of Nations during the last meeting of that organization. On 25 May 1946 the Transjordan became the &quot;Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan&quot; when the ruling &#x27;Amir&#x27; was re-designated as &#x27;King&#x27; by the parliament of Transjordan on the day it ratified the Treaty of London. 25 May is still celebrated as independence day in Jordan although legally the mandate for Transjordan ended on 17 June 1946 when, in accordance with the Treaty of London, the ratifications were exchanged in Amman and Transjordan gained full independence. When King Abdullah applied for membership in the newly formed United Nations, his request was vetoed by the Soviet Union, citing that the nation was not &quot;fully independent&quot; of British control. This resulted in another treaty in March 1948 with Britain in which all restrictions on sovereignty were removed. Despite this, Jordan was not a full member of the United Nations until December 14, 1955.

In April 1949, after the country gained control of the West Bank, the country&#x27;s official name became the &quot;Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan&quot;.

===1948 War and annexation of the West Bank===

Transjordan was one of the Arab states opposed to the partition of Palestine and creation of Israel in May 1948. It participated in the war between the Arab states and the newly founded State of Israel. Thousands of Palestinians fled the Arab-Israeli fighting to the West Bank and Jordan. The Armistice Agreements of 3 April 1949 left Jordan in control of the West Bank and provided that the armistice demarcation lines were without prejudice to future territorial settlements or boundary lines.

The United Nations General Assembly adopted a plan for the future government of Palestine which called for termination of the Mandate not later than 1 August 1948.

The works of Benny Morris, Avi Shlaim, Ilan Pappe, Mary Wilson, Eugene Rogan, and other historians outline a &quot;modus vivendi&quot; agreement between Abdullah and the Yishuv. Those works are taught in most Israeli university courses on the history, political science, and sociology of the region. Archival materials reveal that the parties had negotiated the non-belligerent partition of Palestine between themselves, and that initially they had agreed to abide by the terms of the UN resolution. John Baggot Glubb, the commander of the Arab Legion, wrote that British Foreign Secretary Bevin had given the green light for the Arab Legion to occupy the territory allocated to the Arab state. The Prime Minister of Transjordan explained that Abdullah had received hundreds of petitions from Palestinian notables requesting protection upon the withdrawal of the British forces. Eugene Rogan says that those petitions, from nearly every town and village in Palestine, are preserved in &quot;The Hashemite Documents: The Papers of Abdullah bin al-Husayn, volume V: Palestine 1948&quot; (Amman 1995).

After the mandate was terminated, the armed forces of Transjordan entered Palestine. The Security Council adopted a US-backed resolution that inquired about the number and disposition of Transjordan&#x27;s armed forces in Palestine. The Foreign Minister of Transjordan replied in a telegram &quot;that neither the UN nor US recognized Transjordan, although they both had been given the opportunity for more than two years. Yet the US had recognized the Jewish state immediately, although the factors for this recognition were lacking.&quot;

In explaining to the Security Council why Transjordan&#x27;s armed forces had entered Palestine, Abdullah said: &quot;we were compelled to enter Palestine to protect unarmed Arabs against massacres similar to those of Deir Yassin.&quot;

After capturing the West Bank during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Abdullah was proclaimed King of Palestine by the Jericho Conference. The following year, Jordan annexed the West Bank.

The United States extended &quot;de jure&quot; recognition to the government of Transjordan and the government of Israel on the same day, 31 January 1949. Clea Bunch said that &quot;President Truman crafted a balanced policy between Israel and its moderate Hashemite neighbours when he simultaneously extended formal recognition to the newly created state of Israel and the Kingdom of Transjordan. These two nations were inevitably linked in the President&#x27;s mind as twin emergent states: one serving the needs of the refugee Jew, the other absorbing recently displaced Palestinian Arabs. In addition, Truman was aware of the private agreements that existed between Jewish Agency leaders and King Abdullah I of Jordan. Thus, it made perfect sense to Truman to favour both states with de jure recognition.&quot;

In 1978, the U.S. State Department published a memorandum of conversation between Mr. Stuart W. Rockwell of the Office of African and Near Eastern Affairs and Abdel Monem Rifai, a Counselor of the Jordan Legation, on 5 June 1950. Mr. Rifai asked when the United States was going to recognize the union of Arab Palestine and Jordan. Mr. Rockwell explained the Department&#x27;s position, stating that it was not the custom of the United States to issue formal statements of recognition every time a foreign country changed its territorial area. The union of Arab Palestine and Jordan had been brought about as a result of the will of the people and the US accepted the fact that Jordanian sovereignty had been extended to the new area. Mr. Rifai said he had not realized this and that he was very pleased to learn that the US did in fact recognize the union.

Jordan was admitted as a member state of the United Nations on 14 December 1955.

On 24 April 1950, Jordan formally annexed the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) declaring &quot;complete unity between the two sides of the Jordan and their union in one state... at whose head reigns King Abdullah Ibn al Hussain&quot;. All West Bank residents were granted Jordanian citizenship. The December 1948 Jericho Conference, a meeting of prominent Palestinian leaders and King Abdullah, voted in favor of annexation into what was then Transjordan.

Jordan&#x27;s annexation was regarded as illegal and void by the Arab League and others. It was recognized by Britain, Iraq and Pakistan. The annexation of the West Bank more than doubled the population of Jordan. Both Irbid and Zarqa more than doubled their population from less than 10,000 each to more than, respectively, 23,000 and 28,000.

===Reign of King Hussein===
King Abdullah&#x27;s eldest son, Talal of Jordan, was proclaimed king in 1951, but he was declared mentally unfit to rule and deposed in 1952. His son, Hussein Ibn Talal, became king on his eighteenth birthday, in 1953.

The 1950s have been labelled as a time of &quot;Jordan&#x27;s Experiment with Liberalism&quot;. Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of association were guaranteed in the newly written constitution as with the already firmly established freedom of religion doctrine. Jordan had one of the freest and most liberal societies in the Middle East and in the greater Arab world during the 1950s and early 1960s.

Jordan ended its special defense treaty relationship with the United Kingdom and British troops completed their withdrawal in 1957. In February 1958, following announcement of the merger of Syria and Egypt into the United Arab Republic, Iraq and Jordan announced the Arab Federation of Iraq and Jordan, also known as the Arab Union. The Union was dissolved in August 1958.
In 1965 Jordan and Saudi Arabia concluded a bilateral agreement that realigned the border. The realignment resulted in some exchange of territory, and Jordan&#x27;s coastline on the Gulf of Aqaba was lengthened by about eighteen kilometers. The new boundary enabled Jordan to expand its port facilities and established a zone in which the two parties agreed to share petroleum revenues equally if oil were discovered. The agreement also protected the pasturage and watering rights of nomadic tribes inside the exchanged territories.
Jordan signed a mutual defense pact in May 1967 with Egypt, and it participated, along with Syria, Egypt, and Iraq in the Six-Day War of June 1967 against Israel. During the war, Israel took control of East Jerusalem and West Bank, leading to another major influx of Palestinian refugees into Jordan. Its Palestinian refugee population—700,000 in 1966—grew by another 300,000 from the West Bank. The result of the 29 August 1967 Arab League summit was the Khartoum Resolution, which according to Abd al Azim Ramadan, left only one option -a war with Israel.

The period following the 1967 war saw an upsurge in the power and importance of Palestinian militants (&quot;fedayeen&quot;) in Jordan. Other Arab governments attempted to work out a peaceful solution, but by September 1970, known as the Black September in Jordan, continuing &quot;fedayeen&quot; actions in Jordan — including the destruction of three international airliners hijacked and held in the desert east of Amman — prompted the Jordanian government to take action. In the ensuing heavy fighting, a Syrian tank force took up positions in northern Jordan to support the &quot;fedayeen&quot; but was forced to retreat. By September 22, Arab foreign ministers meeting at Cairo had arranged a cease-fire beginning the following day. Sporadic violence continued, however, until Jordanian forces won a decisive victory over the &quot;fedayeen&quot; in July 1971, expelling them from the country.

An attempted military coup was thwarted in 1972. No fighting occurred along the 1967 cease-fire line during the Yom Kippur War in 1973, but Jordan sent a brigade to Syria to fight Israeli units on Syrian territory.

In 1974, King Hussein recognised the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. However, in 1986, Hussein severed political links with the PLO and ordered its main offices to be closed. In 1988, Jordan renounced all claims to the West Bank but retained an administrative role pending a final settlement. Hussein also publicly backed the Palestinian uprising, or First Intifada, against Israeli rule.

Jordan witnessed some of the most severe protests and social upheavals in its history during the 1980s. Protests in Jordanian universities especially Yarmouk University and urban areas protested inflation and lack of political freedom. A massive upheaval occurred in the southern city of Ma&#x27;an. There was rioting in several cities over price increases in 1989. The same year saw the first general election since 1967. It was contested only by independent candidates because of the ban on political parties in 1963. Martial law was lifted and a period of rapid political liberalization began. Parliament was restored and some thirty political parties, including the Islamic Action Front, were created.

Jordan did not participate directly in the Gulf War of 1990–91, but it broke with the Arab majority and supported the Iraqi position of Saddam Hussein. This position led to the temporary repeal of U.S. aid to Jordan. As a result, Jordan came under severe economic and diplomatic strain. After the Iraqi defeat in 1991, Jordan, along with Syria, Lebanon, and Palestinian representatives, agreed to participate in direct peace negotiations with Israel sponsored by the U.S. and Russia. Eventually, Jordan negotiated an end to hostilities with Israel and signed a declaration to that effect on July 25, 1994; the Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty was concluded on October 26, 1994, ending 46-year official state of war.

Food price riots occurred in 1996, after subsidies were removed under an economic plan supervised by the International Monetary Fund. By the late 1990s, Jordan&#x27;s unemployment rate was almost 25%, while nearly 50% of those who were employed were on the government payroll. The 1997 parliamentary elections were boycotted by several parties, associations and leading figures.

In 1998, King Hussein was treated for lymphatic cancer in the United States. After six months of treatment he returned home to a rousing welcome in January 1999. Soon after, however, he had to fly back to the US for further treatment. King Hussein died in February 1999. More than 50 heads of state attended his funeral. His eldest son, Crown Prince Abdullah, succeeded to the throne.

===Reign of King Abdullah II===
====Economy====
Economic liberalization policies under King Abdullah II have helped to create one of the freest economies in the Middle East.

In March 2001, King Abdullah and presidents Bashar al-Assad of Syria and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt inaugurated a $300m (£207m) electricity line linking the grids of the three countries. In September 2002, Jordan and Israel agreed on a plan to pipe water from the Red Sea to the shrinking Dead Sea. The project, costing $800m, is the two nations&#x27; biggest joint venture to date. King Abdullah and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad launched the Wahdah Dam project at a ceremony on the Yarmuk River in February 2004.

====Foreign relations====
Jordan has sought to remain at peace with all of its neighbors. In September 2000, a military court sentenced six men to death for plotting attacks against Israeli and US targets. Following the outbreak of Israeli-Palestinian fighting in September 2000, Amman withdrew its ambassador to Israel for four years. In 2003, Jordan&#x27;s Central Bank retracted an earlier decision to freeze accounts belonging to leaders of Hamas. When senior US diplomat Laurence Foley was gunned down outside his home in Amman in October 2002, in the first assassination of a Western diplomat in Jordan, scores of political activists were rounded up. Eight militants were later found guilty and executed in 2004. King Abdullah did, however, criticise the United States and Israel over the conflict in Lebanon in 2006.

====Politics====
Jordan&#x27;s gradual institution of political and civil liberty has continued, but the slow pace of reform has led to increasing discontent. Following the death of a youth in custody, riots erupted in the southern town of Ma&#x27;an in January 2002, the worst public disturbances in more than three years.

The first parliamentary elections under King Abdullah II were held in June 2003. Independent candidates loyal to the king won two-thirds of the seats. A new cabinet was appointed in October 2003 following the resignation of Prime Minister Ali Abu al-Ragheb. Faisal al-Fayez was appointed prime minister. The king also appointed three female ministers. However, in April 2005, amid reports of the king&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the slow pace of reforms, the government resigned and a new cabinet was sworn in, led by Prime Minister Adnan Badran.

The first local elections since 1999 were held in July 2007. The main opposition party, the Islamist Action Front, withdrew after accusing the government of vote-rigging. The parliamentary elections of November 2007 strengthened the position of tribal leaders and other pro-government candidates. Support for the opposition Islamic Action Front declined. Political moderate Nader Dahabi was appointed prime minister.

In November 2009, the King once more dissolved parliament halfway through its four-year term. The following month, he appointed a new premier to push through economic reform. A new electoral law was introduced May 2010, but pro-reform campaigners said it did little to make the system more representational. The parliamentary elections of November 2010 were boycotted by the opposition Islamic Action Front. Riots broke out after it was announced that pro-government candidates had won a sweeping victory.

====Arab Spring====
On 14 January, the Jordanian protests began in Jordan&#x27;s capital Amman, and at Ma&#x27;an, Al Karak, Salt and Irbid, and other cities. The following month, King Abdullah appointed a new prime minister, former army general Marouf Bakhit, and charged him with quelling the protests whilst carrying out political reforms. The street protests continued through the summer, albeit on a smaller scale, prompting the King to replace Bakhit with Awn al-Khasawneh, a judge at the International Court of Justice (October 2011). However, Prime Minister Awn al-Khasawneh resigned abruptly after just six months having been unable to satisfy either the demands for reform or allay establishment fears of empowering the Islamist opposition. King Abdullah appointed former prime minister Fayez al-Tarawneh to succeed him.

In October 2012, King Abdullah called for early parliamentary elections, to be held at some time in 2013. The Islamic Action Front, continued in its calls for broader political representation and a more democratic parliament. The King appointed Abdullah Ensour, a former minister and vocal advocate of democratic reform, as prime minister.

Mass demonstrations took place in Amman (November 2012) against the lifting of fuel subsidies. Public calls for the end of the monarchy were heard. Clashes between protesters and supporters of the king followed. The government reversed the fuel price rise following the protest. &quot;Al Jazeera&quot; stated that protests are expected to continue for several weeks because of increasing food prices.

====Arab Winter====

With the rapid expansion of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant into northern and eastern Iraq in summer of 2014, Jordan became threatened by the radical Jihadist organization, and deployed more troops on the Iraqi and Syrian borders.

<text>A flange is a protruded ridge, lip or rim, either external or internal, that serves to increase strength (as the flange of a steel beam such as an I-beam or a T-beam); for easy attachment/transfer of contact force with another object (as the flange on the end of a pipe, steam cylinder, etc., or on the lens mount of a camera); or for stabilizing and guiding the movements of a machine or its parts (as the inside flange of a rail car or tram wheel, which keep the wheels from running off the rails). Flanges are often attached using bolts in the pattern of a bolt circle.

Flanges play a pivotal role in piping systems by allowing easy access for maintenance, inspection, and modification. They provide a means to connect or disconnect pipes and equipment without the need for welding, which simplifies installation and reduces downtime during repairs or upgrades. Additionally, flanges facilitate the alignment of pipes, ensuring a proper fit and minimizing stress on the system.

== Plumbing or piping ==

A flange can also be a plate or ring to form a rim at the end of a pipe when fastened to the pipe (for example, a closet flange). A blind flange is a plate for covering or closing the end of a pipe. A flange joint is a connection of pipes, where the connecting pieces have flanges by which the parts are bolted together.

Although the word &#x27;flange&#x27; generally refers to the actual raised rim or lip of a fitting, many flanged plumbing fittings are themselves known as flanges.

Common flanges used in plumbing are the Surrey flange or Danzey flange, York flange, Sussex flange and Essex flange.
Surrey and York flanges fit to the top of the hot water tank allowing all the water to be taken without disturbance to the tank. They are often used to ensure an even flow of water to showers. An Essex flange requires a hole to be drilled in the side of the tank.

There is also a Warix flange which is the same as a York flange but the shower output is on the top of the flange and the vent on the side. The York and Warix flange have female adapters so that they fit onto a male tank, whereas the Surrey flange connects to a female tank.

A closet flange provides the mount for a toilet.

== Pipe flanges ==
Piping components can be bolted together between flanges. Flanges are used to connect pipes with each other, to valves, to fittings, and to specialty items such as strainers and pressure vessels. A cover plate can be connected to create a &quot;blind flange&quot;. Flanges are joined by bolting, and sealing is often completed with the use of gaskets or other methods. Mechanical means to mitigate effects of leaks, like spray guards or specific spray flanges, may be included. Industries where flammable, volatile, toxic or corrosive substances are being processed have greater need of special protection at flanged connections.
Flange guards can provide that added level of protection to ensure safety.

There are many different flange standards to be found worldwide. To allow easy functionality and interchangeability, these are designed to have standardised dimensions. Common world standards include ASA/ASME (USA), PN/DIN (European), BS10 (British/Australian), and JIS/KS (Japanese/Korean). In the USA, the standard is ASME B16.5 (ANSI stopped publishing B16.5 in 1996). ASME B16.5 covers flanges up to 24 inches size and up to pressure rating of Class 2500. Flanges larger than 24 inches are covered in ASME B16.47.

In most cases, standards are interchangeable, as most local standards have been aligned to ISO standards; however, some local standards still differ. For example, an ASME flange will not mate against an ISO flange. Further, many of the flanges in each standard are divided into &quot;pressure classes&quot;, allowing flanges to be capable of taking different pressure ratings. Again these are not generally interchangeable (e.g. an ASME 150 will not mate with an ASME 300).

These pressure classes also have differing pressure and temperature ratings for different materials. Unique pressure classes for piping can also be developed for a process plant or power generating station; these may be specific to the corporation, engineering procurement and construction (EPC) contractor, or the process plant owner. The ASME pressure classes for flat-face flanges are Class 125 and Class 250. The classes for ring-joint, tongue and groove, and raised-face flanges are Class 150, Class 300, Class 400 (unusual), Class 600, Class 900, Class 1500, and Class 2500.

The flange faces are also made to standardized dimensions and are typically &quot;flat face&quot;, &quot;raised face&quot;, &quot;tongue and groove&quot;, or &quot;ring joint&quot; styles, although other obscure styles are possible.

Flange designs are available as &quot;weld neck&quot;, &quot;slip-on&quot;, &quot;lap joint&quot;, &quot;socket weld&quot;, &quot;threaded&quot;, and also &quot;blind&quot;.

== Types of flanges ==
Flanges come in various types, each designed to meet specific requirements based on factors such as pressure, temperature, and application. Some common types include:

# Weld Neck Flanges: Weld neck flanges feature a long tapered hub that provides reinforcement to the connection, making them suitable for high-pressure and high-temperature applications.
# Slip-On Flanges: Slip-on flanges have a slightly larger diameter than the pipe they connect to and are slipped over the pipe before welding. They are commonly used in low-pressure and non-critical applications.
# Socket Weld Flanges: Socket weld flanges have a recessed area (socket) into which the pipe end fits, allowing for fillet welding. They are suitable for small-bore piping systems and applications with moderate pressure and temperature requirements.
# Blind Flanges: Blind flanges are solid discs used to close the end of a piping system or vessel. They are often used for pressure testing or as a permanent seal when a pipe end needs to be closed off.

=== ASME standards (U.S.) ===
Pipe flanges that are made to standards called out by ASME B16.5 or ASME B16.47, and MSS SP-44. They are typically made from forged materials and have machined surfaces. ASME B16.5 refers to nominal pipe sizes (NPS) from &quot; to 24&quot;. B16.47 covers NPSs from 26&quot; to 60&quot;. Each specification further delineates flanges into pressure classes: 150, 300, 400, 600, 900, 1500 and 2500 for B16.5, and B16.47 delineates its flanges into pressure classes 75, 150, 300, 400, 600, 900. However these classes do not correspond to maximum pressures in psi. Instead, the maximum pressure depends on the material of the flange and the temperature. For example, the maximum pressure for a Class 150 flange is 285 psi, and for a Class 300 flange it is 740 psi (both are for ASTM a105 carbon steel and temperatures below 100 °F).

The gasket type and bolt type are generally specified by the standard(s); however, sometimes the standards refer to the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (B&amp;PVC) for details (see ASME Code Section VIII Division 1 – Appendix 2). These flanges are recognized by ASME Pipe Codes such as ASME B31.1 Power Piping, and ASME B31.3 Process Piping.

Materials for flanges are usually under ASME designation: SA-105 (Specification for Carbon Steel Forgings for Piping Applications), SA-266 (Specification for Carbon Steel Forgings for Pressure Vessel Components), or SA-182 (Specification for Forged or Rolled Alloy-Steel Pipe Flanges, Forged Fittings, and Valves and Parts for High-Temperature Service). In addition, there are many &quot;industry standard&quot; flanges that in some circumstance may be used on ASME work.

The product range includes SORF, SOFF, BLRF, BLFF, WNRF (XS, XXS, STD and Schedule 20, 40, 80), WNFF (XS, XXS, STD and Schedule 20, 40, 80), SWRF (XS and STD), SWFF (XS and STD), Threaded RF, Threaded FF and LJ, with sizes from 1/2&quot; to 16&quot;. The bolting material used for flange connection is stud bolts mated with two nut (washer when required). In petrochemical industries, ASTM A193 B7 STUD and ASTM A193 B16 stud bolts are used as these have high tensile strength.

=== European dimensions (EN / DIN) Hygienic Flange STC DIN11853-2 ===
Most countries in Europe mainly install flanges according to standard DIN EN 1092-1 (forged stainless or steel flanges). Similar to the ASME flange standard, the EN 1092-1 standard has the basic flange forms, such as weld neck flange, blind flange, lapped flange, threaded flange (thread ISO7-1 instead of NPT), weld on collar, pressed collars, and adapter flange such as flange coupling GD press fittings. The different forms of flanges within the EN 1092-1 (European Norm/Euronorm) is indicated within the flange name through the type. 

Similar to ASME flanges, EN1092-1 steel and stainless flanges, have several different versions of raised or none raised faces. According to the European form the seals are indicated by different form:

Furthermore, for sanitary applications such as in the food and beverage and pharmaceutical industries, sanitary flanges according to DIN 11853-2 STC are utilized. The primary distinction between sanitary flanges according to DIN 11853-2 and DIN/EN flanges lies in the restricted dead-room and the interior polishing according to hygienic levels of H1 to H4. Usually the flange traders that hold the Standard DIN EN 1092-1 such as Hage Fittings, do not hold Sanitary flanges as the storage requirements are different. Sanitary flanges are more delicate and need to stay clean. Usually the O-Rings, according to DIn 11853, are made out of FPM or EPDM.

=== Other countries ===
Flanges in the rest of the world are manufactured according to the ISO standards for materials, pressure ratings, etc. to which local standards including DIN, BS, and others, have been aligned.

== Compact flanges ==
As the size of a compact flange increases it becomes relatively increasingly heavy and complex resulting in high procurement, installation and maintenance costs.
Large flange diameters in particular are difficult to work with, and inevitably require more space and have a more challenging handling and installation procedure, particularly on remote installations such as oil rigs.

The design of the flange face includes two independent seals. The first seal is created by application of seal seating stress at the flange heel, but it is not straight forward to ensure the function of this seal.

Theoretically, the heel contact will be maintained for pressure values up to 1.8 times the flange rating at room temperature.

Theoretically, the flange also remains in contact along its outer circumference at the flange faces for all allowable load levels that it is designed for.

The main seal is the IX seal ring. The seal ring force is provided by the elastic stored energy in the stressed seal ring. Any heel leakage will give internal pressure acting on the seal ring inside intensifying the sealing action. This however requires the IX ring to be retained in the theoretical location in the ring groove which is difficult to ensure and verify during installation.

The design aims at preventing exposure to oxygen and other corrosive agents. Thus, this prevents corrosion of the flange faces, the stressed length of the bolts and the seal ring. This however depends on the outer dust rim to remain in satisfactory contact and that the inside fluid is not corrosive in case of leaking into the bolt circle void.

=== Applications of compact flanges ===
The initial cost of the theoretical higher performance compact flange is inevitably higher than a regular flange due to the closer tolerances and significantly more sophisticated design and installation requirements.
By way of example, compact flanges are often used across the following applications: subsea oil and gas or riser, cold work and cryogenics, gas injection, high temperature, and nuclear applications.

== Train wheels ==
Most trains and trams stay on their tracks primarily due to the conical geometry of their wheels. They also have a flange on one side to keep the wheels, and hence the train, running on the rails when the limits of the geometry-based alignment are reached, either due to some emergency or defect, or simply because the curve radius is so small that self-steering normally provided by the coned wheel tread is no longer effective.
== Vacuum flanges ==

A vacuum flange is a flange at the end of a tube used to connect vacuum chambers, tubing and vacuum pumps to each other.

== Microwave ==
In microwave telecommunications, a flange is a type of cable joint that allows different types of waveguide to connect.

Several different microwave RF flange types exist, such as CAR, CBR, OPC, PAR, PBJ, PBR, PDR, UAR, UBR, UDR, icp and UPX.
== Ski boots ==
Ski boots use flanges at the toe or heel to connect to the binding of the ski. The size and shape for flanges on alpine skiing boots is standardized in ISO 5355. Traditional telemark and cross country boots use the 75 mm Nordic Norm, but the toe flange is informally known as the &quot;duckbill&quot;. New cross country bindings eliminate the flange entirely and use a steel bar embedded within the sole instead.

<doc id="45321" wikidata="Q76956" url="?curid=45321" title="Rudolf I of Germany">
<text>Rudolf I (1 May 1218 – 15 July 1291) was the first King of Germany of the Habsburg dynasty from 1273 until his death.

Rudolf&#x27;s election marked the end of the Great Interregnum which had begun after the death of the Hohenstaufen Emperor Frederick II in 1250. Originally a Swabian count, he was the first Habsburg to acquire the duchies of Austria and Styria in opposition to his mighty rival, the Přemyslid king Ottokar II of Bohemia, whom he defeated in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld. The territories remained under Habsburg rule for more than 600 years, forming the core of the Habsburg monarchy and the present-day country of Austria. Rudolf played a vital role in raising the comital House of Habsburg to the rank of Imperial princes.

== Early life ==
Rudolf was born on 1 May 1218 at Limburgh Castle near Sasbach am Kaiserstuhl in the Breisgau region of present-day southwestern Germany. He was the son of Count Albert IV of Habsburg and Hedwig, daughter of Count Ulrich of Kyburg. Around 1232, he was given as a squire to his uncle, Rudolf I, Count of Laufenburg, to train in knightly pursuits.

== Count of Habsburg ==

At his father&#x27;s death in 1239, Rudolf inherited from him large estates around the ancestral seat of Habsburg Castle in the Aargau region of present-day Switzerland as well as in Alsace. Thus, in 1240, in order to quell the rising power of Rudolf and in an attempt to place the important &quot;Devil&#x27;s Bridge&quot; (&#x27;) across the &#x27; under his direct control, Emperor Frederick II granted Schwyz &quot;Reichsfreiheit&quot; in the &quot;Freibrief von Faenza&quot;.

In 1242, Hugh of Tuffenstein provoked Count Rudolf through contumelious expressions. In turn, the Count of Habsburg had invaded his domains, yet failed to take his seat of power. As the day passed on, Count Rudolf bribed the sentinels of the city and gained entry, killing Hugh in the process. Then in 1244, to help control Lake Lucerne and restrict the neighboring forest communities of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden, Rudolf built near its shores Neuhabsburg Castle. In 1245 Rudolf married Gertrude, daughter of Count Burkhard III of Hohenberg. He received as her dowry the castles of Oettingen, the valley of Weile, and other places in Alsace, and he became an important vassal in Swabia, the former Alemannic German stem duchy.

Rudolf paid frequent visits to the court of his godfather, the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick II, and his loyalty to Frederick and his son, King Conrad IV of Germany, was richly rewarded by grants of land. In 1254, he engaged with other nobles of the Staufen party against Bertold II, Bishop of Basle. When night fell, he penetrated the suburbs of Basle and burnt down the local nunnery, an act for which Pope Innocent IV excommunicated him and all parties involved. As a penance, he took up the cross and joined Ottokar II, King of Bohemia in the Prussian Crusade of 1254. Whilst there, he oversaw the founding of the city of Königsberg, which was named in memory of King Ottokar.

== Rise to power ==
The disorder in Germany during the interregnum after the fall of the Hohenstaufen dynasty afforded an opportunity for Count Rudolf to increase his possessions. His wife was a Hohenberg heiress; and on the death of his childless maternal uncle Count Hartmann IV of Kyburg in 1264, Rudolf seized Hartmann&#x27;s valuable estates. Successful feuds with the Bishops of Strasbourg and Basel further augmented his wealth and reputation, including rights over various tracts of land that he purchased from abbots and others.

These various sources of wealth and influence rendered Rudolf the most powerful prince and noble in southwestern Germany (where the tribal Duchy of Swabia had disintegrated, enabling its vassals to become completely independent). In the autumn of 1273, the prince-electors met to choose a king after Richard of Cornwall had died in England in April 1272. Rudolf&#x27;s election in Frankfurt on 1 October 1273, when he was 55 years old, was largely due to the efforts of his brother-in-law, the Hohenzollern burgrave Frederick III of Nuremberg. The support of Duke Albert II of Saxony and Elector Palatine Louis II had been purchased by betrothing them to two of Rudolf&#x27;s daughters.

As a result, within the electoral college, King Ottokar II of Bohemia (1230–1278), himself a candidate for the throne and related to the late Hohenstaufen king Philip of Swabia (being the son of the eldest surviving daughter), was almost alone in opposing Rudolf. Other candidates were Prince Siegfried I of Anhalt and Margrave Frederick I of Meissen (1257–1323), a young grandson of the excommunicated Emperor Frederick II, who did not yet even have a principality of his own as his father was still alive. By the admission of Duke Henry XIII of Lower Bavaria instead of the King of Bohemia as the seventh Elector, Rudolf gained all seven votes.

==King of the Germans==

On 1 October 1273, Rudolf was voted in unanimously as king by the electors who were present at Frankfurt. He was then crowned in Aachen Cathedral on 24 October 1273. To win the approbation of the Pope, Rudolf renounced all imperial rights in Rome, the papal territory, and Sicily, and promised to lead a new crusade by taking the crusader&#x27;s vow in 1275. Pope Gregory X, despite the protests of Ottokar II of Bohemia, not only recognised Rudolf himself, but persuaded King Alfonso X of Castile (another grandson of Philip of Swabia), who had been chosen German (anti-)king in 1257 as the successor to Count William II of Holland, to do the same. Thus, Rudolf surpassed the two heirs of the Hohenstaufen dynasty whom he had earlier served so loyally.

In November 1274, the Imperial Diet at Nuremberg decided that all Crown estates seized since the death of the Emperor Frederick II must be restored, and that King Ottokar II must answer to the Diet for not recognising the new king. Ottokar refused to appear or to restore the duchies of Austria, Styria and Carinthia together with the March of Carniola, which he had claimed through his first wife, a Babenberg heiress, and which he had seized while disputing them with another Babenberg heir, Margrave Hermann VI of Baden. Rudolf refused to accept Ottokar&#x27;s succession to the Babenberg patrimony, declaring that the provinces reverted to the Imperial crown due to the lack of male-line heirs. King Ottokar was placed under the imperial ban; and in June 1276 war was declared against him.

Having persuaded Ottokar&#x27;s former ally Duke Henry XIII of Lower Bavaria to switch sides, Rudolf compelled the Bohemian king to cede the four provinces to the control of the royal administration in November 1276. Rudolf then re-invested Ottokar with the Kingdom of Bohemia, betrothed one of his daughters to Ottokar&#x27;s son Wenceslaus II, and made a triumphal entry into Vienna. Ottokar, however, raised questions about the execution of the treaty, and procured the support of several German princes, again including Henry XIII of Lower Bavaria. To meet this coalition, Rudolf formed an alliance with King Ladislaus IV of Hungary and gave additional privileges to the Viennese citizens. On 26 August 1278, the rival armies met at the Battle on the Marchfeld, where Ottokar was defeated and killed. The Margraviate of Moravia was subdued and its government entrusted to Rudolf&#x27;s representatives, leaving Ottokar&#x27;s widow Kunigunda of Slavonia in control of only the province surrounding Prague, while the young Wenceslaus II was again betrothed to Rudolf&#x27;s youngest daughter Judith.

Rudolf&#x27;s attention next turned to the possessions in Austria and the adjacent provinces, which were taken into the royal domain. He spent several years establishing his authority there but found some difficulty in establishing his family as successors to the rule of those provinces. At length, the hostility of the princes was overcome. In December 1282, at the Hoftag (imperial diet) in Augsburg, Rudolf invested his sons, Albert and Rudolf II, with the duchies of Austria and Styria and so laid the foundation of the House of Habsburg. Additionally, he made the twelve-year-old Rudolf Duke of Swabia, a merely titular dignity, as the duchy had been without an actual ruler since Conradin&#x27;s execution. The 27-year-old Duke Albert, married since 1274 to a daughter of Count Meinhard II of Gorizia-Tyrol (1238–95), was capable enough to hold some sway in the new patrimony.
In 1286, King Rudolf fully invested Albert&#x27;s father-in-law Count Meinhard with the Duchy of Carinthia, one of the conquered provinces taken from Ottokar. The Princes of the Empire did not allow Rudolf to give everything that was recovered to the royal domain to his own sons, and his allies needed their rewards too. Turning to the west, in 1281 he compelled Count Philip I of Savoy to cede some territory to him, then forced the citizens of Bern to pay the tribute that they had been refusing. After his son Rudolf II defeated Bern at the Battle of Schosshalde, he strengthened his authority in Switzerland. He further expanded his Swiss possessions and granted some ecclesiastical posts to his family. In 1289 he marched against Count Philip&#x27;s successor, Otto IV, compelling him to do homage.

In 1281, Rudolf&#x27;s first wife died. On 5 February 1284, he married Isabella, daughter of Duke Hugh IV of Burgundy, the Empire&#x27;s western neighbor in the Kingdom of France.

Rudolf was not very successful in restoring internal peace. Orders were indeed issued for the establishment of territorial peaces in Bavaria, Franconia and Swabia, and at the Synod of Würzburg in March 1287 for the whole Empire. But the king lacked the power, resources, and determination to enforce them, although in December 1289 he led an expedition into Thuringia, where he destroyed a number of robber castles. In 1291, he attempted to secure the election of his son Albert as German king. The electors refused, however, claiming inability to support two kings, but in reality, perhaps, wary of the increasing power of the House of Habsburg. Upon Rudolf&#x27;s death they elected Count Adolf of Nassau.

== Persecution of the Jews ==
In 1286, Rudolf I instituted a new persecution of the Jews, declaring them &quot;servi camerae&quot; (&quot;serfs of the treasury&quot;), which had the effect of negating their political freedoms. Along with many others, Rabbi Meir of Rothenburg left Germany with family and followers, but was captured in Lombardy and imprisoned in a fortress in Alsace. Tradition has it that a large ransom of 23,000 marks silver was raised for him (by the Rosh), but Rabbi Meir refused it, for fear of encouraging the imprisonment of other rabbis. He died in prison after seven years. Fourteen years after his death a ransom was paid for his body by Alexander ben Shlomo (Susskind) Wimpfen, who was subsequently laid to rest beside the Maharam.

== Death ==

Rudolf died in Speyer on 15 July 1291 and was buried in Speyer Cathedral. Only one of his sons survived him: Albert I. Most of his daughters outlived him, apart from Catherine who had died in 1282 during childbirth and Hedwig who had died in 1285/6.

Rudolf&#x27;s reign is most memorable for his establishment of the House of Habsburg as a powerful dynasty in the southeastern part of the realm. In the other territories, the centuries-long decline of Imperial authority since the days of the Investiture Controversy continued, and the princes were largely left to their own devices.

In the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, Dante finds Rudolf sitting outside the gates of purgatory with his contemporaries, characterizing him as &quot;he who neglected that which he ought to have done&quot;.

== Family and children ==
Rudolf was married twice. First, in 1251, to Gertrude of Hohenberg and second, in 1284, to Isabelle of Burgundy. All children were from the first marriage.

<text>Professor Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore is a fictional character in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series of novels by J. K. Rowling. For most of the series, he is the headmaster of the wizarding school Hogwarts. He is also the founder and leader of the Order of the Phoenix, an organisation dedicated to fighting the Dark wizard Lord Voldemort.

Dumbledore is widely regarded as one of the most powerful and influential wizards of his time. Renowned for his wisdom, kindness, and formidable magical abilities, he plays a crucial role in shaping the events of the wizarding world. As a mentor to Harry Potter, he provides guidance and crucial knowledge in the fight against Voldemort. Despite his benevolent image, Dumbledore’s past is marked by tragedy and complexity, including his youthful association with Gellert Grindelwald, a dark wizard he later defeated. His philosophical views on power, love, and death are central themes in the series, solidifying his status as one of the most enigmatic and revered figures in wizarding history. 

Dumbledore is portrayed by Richard Harris in the film adaptations of &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (2001) and &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; (2002). Following Harris&#x27; death in October 2002, Michael Gambon was cast in the role. He plays Dumbledore in six &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films, which were released from 2004 to 2011. Jude Law portrays a middle-aged version of the character in the prequel films &quot;Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald&quot; (2018) and &quot;Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore&quot; (2022). John Lithgow is set to portray him in the upcoming HBO series for Max.

==Creation and development==
Rowling has described Dumbledore as &quot;the epitome of goodness.&quot; She said that he speaks for her, as he &quot;knows pretty much everything&quot; about the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; universe. Rowling mentioned that Dumbledore regrets &quot;that he has always had to be the one who knew, and who had the burden of knowing. And he would rather not know.&quot; As a mentor to the central character Harry Potter, &quot;Dumbledore is a very wise man who knows that Harry is going to have to learn a few hard lessons to prepare him for what may be coming in his life. He allows Harry to get into what he would not allow another pupil to do, and he also unwillingly permits Harry to confront things he&#x27;d rather protect him from.&quot; In a 1999 interview, Rowling stated that she imagined Dumbledore &quot;more as a John Gielgud type, you know, quite elderly and – and quite stately.&quot; During his time as a student, Dumbledore was in Gryffindor House. In a 2000 interview, Rowling said that Dumbledore &quot;is a hundred and fifty&quot; during the events of the novels, as said also by the character Ron Weasley in &quot;Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince&quot;. However, she has stated on her website that he was born in 1881, which makes him either 115 or 116 at the time of his death.

In 2007, Rowling was asked whether Dumbledore finds &quot;true love&quot;. Rowling said that she always thought of Dumbledore as being homosexual and that he had fallen in love with the corrupt wizard Gellert Grindelwald, which was Dumbledore&#x27;s &quot;great tragedy&quot;; Rowling did not explicitly state whether Grindelwald returned his affections. Rowling explains this further by elaborating on the motivations behind Dumbledore&#x27;s flirtation with the idea of wizard domination of Muggles: &quot;He lost his moral compass completely when he fell in love and I think subsequently became very mistrustful of his own judgement in those matters so became quite asexual. He led a celibate and a bookish life.&quot;

The name &quot;Dumbledore&quot; is an 18th-century word for &quot;bumblebee&quot;. Rowling chose the name because Dumbledore loves music, and she imagined him walking around and humming to himself frequently.

==Appearances in novels==

===&quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;===
Dumbledore is introduced in the opening chapter of the first novel in the series, &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (1997). Under cover of night, he brings the infant Harry Potter to the home of Harry&#x27;s uncle and aunt, Vernon and Petunia Dursley. Harry&#x27;s parents were killed by the Dark wizard Voldemort, and Dumbledore hopes he will be safe with the Dursleys. He leaves Harry on the doorstep with a letter explaining the situation. When Harry arrives at Hogwarts ten years later, Dumbledore tells him about the Mirror of Erised, a magical object that protects the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone. Dumbledore is summoned to the Ministry of Magic by a false message on the night when Harry, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Professor Quirinus Quirrell enter the dungeons to retrieve the Stone. He realises during the trip that he is needed at Hogwarts, and returns in time to rescue Harry from Quirrell and Voldemort.

===&quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;===
Dumbledore returns in the second novel, &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; (1998). Through a magical diary, Harry sees a younger Dumbledore in a series of flashbacks. The diary once belonged to Tom Riddle, who eventually became Voldemort. In one flashback, Harry sees Dumbledore questioning Riddle about a series of attacks on Muggle-born students. In the present, a basilisk emerges from the Chamber of Secrets and begins attacking people in Hogwarts. Following the attacks, Lucius Malfoy convinces the governors of Hogwarts to suspend Dumbledore from his position as Headmaster. Dumbledore is reinstated when it is revealed that Lucius coerced the governors into suspending him.

===&quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;===
At the beginning of &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; (1999), Dumbledore is forced to accept the presence of Dementors at Hogwarts. The Dementors have been sent to protect the students from Sirius Black, a supposed murderer who escaped from the wizard prison Azkaban. When Black breaches Hogwarts, Dumbledore closes every entrance to the school and grounds. After the Dementors cause Harry to fall off his broom during a Quidditch match, Dumbledore becomes angry and uses his wand to help Harry return safely to the ground. Later, Dumbledore suggests that Hermione use her Time-Turner to save Black and Buckbeak the hippogriff from execution.

===&quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;===
In &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; (2000), Dumbledore brings the Triwizard Tournament to Hogwarts. He also serves as a judge throughout the event. After the final task of the tournament, Harry returns from an encounter with Voldemort. Professor Mad-Eye Moody escorts Harry into the castle, and Dumbledore becomes suspicious. He discovers that Moody is actually Barty Crouch Jr., and that the real Moody is being held prisoner by Crouch. Later, Dumbledore listens to Harry&#x27;s account of Voldemort&#x27;s return.

===&quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;===
Dumbledore appears in the fifth novel in the series, &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; (2003). He is removed from his position as Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, voted out of the Chairmanship of the International Confederation of Wizards, and is almost stripped of his Order of Merlin First Class due to his speeches regarding the return of Voldemort. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Magic attempts to discredit him and Harry, often through the &quot;Daily Prophet&quot;. Dumbledore enrages Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge when he intercedes at a hearing to prevent Harry from being expelled from Hogwarts.

The Ministry passes Educational Decree Twenty-two, which allows Fudge to appoint Dolores Umbridge as the professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts. Through her, Fudge gradually gains power over Hogwarts and Dumbledore, whom he fears is amassing an underage wizard army to overthrow the Ministry. Umbridge forbids students from practicing defensive spells in her class, which prompts Harry, Ron, and Hermione to form a secret practice group called Dumbledore&#x27;s Army. When the Ministry discovers the group, Dumbledore shields his students from punishment by falsely claiming that it was his idea. He is removed from the position of headmaster for the second time.

When the Order of the Phoenix battles Voldemort&#x27;s Death Eaters in the Department of Mysteries, Dumbledore arrives to aid them. He subdues most of the Death Eaters and binds them with an Anti-Disapparition Jinx to prevent them from escaping. He then engages in a duel with Voldemort, who tries to possess Harry so Dumbledore will kill him. After this ruse fails, Voldemort is forced to flee with Bellatrix Lestrange. Several Ministry officials witness the end of the battle, which leads to Dumbledore being reinstated as headmaster. Dumbledore explains to Harry that Voldemort chose Harry as his equal, and that either he or Voldemort must eventually kill the other.

===&quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;===
In &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; (2005), Dumbledore brings Harry along as he attempts to persuade Horace Slughorn to rejoin the Hogwarts faculty. Harry notices that Dumbledore&#x27;s right hand is shrivelled and blackened. During the school year, Dumbledore uses the Pensieve to teach Harry about Voldemort&#x27;s life and his rise to power. In one of the Pensieve visions, Harry witnesses Dumbledore&#x27;s first encounter with the young Tom Riddle. Dumbledore had known from the beginning that Riddle was dangerous, but believed that Hogwarts would change him.

Dumbledore and Harry learn that Voldemort created six Horcruxes to gain immortality, and that they must be destroyed before Voldemort can be killed. Harry repeatedly warns Dumbledore that Draco Malfoy is an agent of Voldemort, but Dumbledore refuses to take action against Draco. He tells Harry that he already knows more about what is happening than Harry does. Near the end of the novel, Dumbledore and Harry enter a cave in search of a Horcrux. Dumbledore drinks a potion inside the Horcrux&#x27;s container and begins to scream in agony. When Harry attempts to retrieve some lake water for Dumbledore to drink, he is attacked by Inferi that reside in the lake. They try to drown Harry, but Dumbledore rescues him.

Dumbledore and Harry arrive in the Hogwarts Astronomy Tower with the Horcrux. Dumbledore asks Harry not to interfere in the events that are about to take place, and puts him in a body-binding curse. Immobilized, Harry is unable to intervene as Draco arrives and disarms Dumbledore. Several other Death Eaters then enter the tower and try to persuade Draco to kill Dumbledore. When Draco hesitates, Severus Snape appears and performs the killing curse on the headmaster. His funeral is attended by students, Hogwarts staff, members of the Ministry of Magic and others. He is entombed in a marble sarcophagus beside the Hogwarts lake.

===&quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;===
Details of Dumbledore&#x27;s earlier life are revealed in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; (2007). The novel introduces his parents, Percival and Kendra Dumbledore, and his younger sister, Ariana (his younger brother, Aberforth, is mentioned in previous books). At the age of six, Ariana was attacked by three Muggle boys who witnessed her performing magic. She was deeply traumatised and was never able to control her magic again. Enraged, Percival attacked the boys and was given a life sentence in Azkaban. Kendra subsequently moved the family to the village of Godric&#x27;s Hollow. Around the time that Albus completed his education, Ariana accidentally killed their mother. Albus became the head of the family and remained in their house with Ariana while Aberforth finished school.

Soon afterward, Dumbledore befriended the young wizard Gellert Grindelwald. They dreamed of uniting the three Deathly Hallows – the Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone and the Cloak of Invisibility – and creating a world in which wizards rule over Muggles. One day, an argument between Albus, Aberforth, and Grindelwald led to a duel that resulted in Ariana&#x27;s death. For the rest of his life, Albus felt guilty, never certain whether it was his own curse or another&#x27;s that killed his sister. He felt he could not be trusted with power and turned down the position of Minister for Magic multiple times, eventually returning to Hogwarts as a professor of Transfiguration. Decades later, Dumbledore faced and defeated Grindelwald, who had become a Dark wizard and had obtained the Elder Wand. Dumbledore now possessed not only the Elder Wand but also the Cloak of Invisibility, which he had borrowed from James Potter before his death. Dumbledore would eventually pass the cloak on to Harry.

The truth about Dumbledore&#x27;s death is revealed to Harry through Snape&#x27;s memories in the Pensieve. Harry learns that Dumbledore put on a cursed ring that held the Resurrection Stone, which he hoped would allow him to apologise to his sister and parents. The curse damaged his hand, and Snape told him he would die in about a year. Dumbledore then revealed to Snape that he knew about Draco&#x27;s attempts to kill him. Since Dumbledore was close to death, he asked Snape to use the killing curse on him. This act of self-sacrifice would prevent Draco&#x27;s soul from being damaged by committing murder, and would cause Voldemort to trust Snape completely.

Near the end of the novel, Harry is struck by Voldemort&#x27;s killing curse. He finds himself in an ethereal realm with Dumbledore, who confesses many regrets from earlier in his life. He informs Harry that he can return to his body and face the Dark Lord again. Harry returns, kills Voldemort, then places the Elder Wand in Dumbledore&#x27;s tomb. In the book&#x27;s epilogue, it is revealed that Harry named his second son Albus Severus Potter, after Dumbledore and Snape.

=== &quot;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&quot; ===
Dumbledore appears in the play &quot;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&quot; (2016). The play is written by Jack Thorne from a story by Thorne, J. K. Rowling and John Tiffany. The plot occurs nineteen years after the events of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, and features time-travel elements.

==Portrayal in films==

In the film adaptations of &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (2001) and &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; (2002), Dumbledore is portrayed by Richard Harris, who was expected to play the character throughout the series. Before Harris was cast, Patrick McGoohan reportedly had an interest in the role, but could not commit due to health issues. Sean Connery was approached, but declined due to the film&#x27;s subject matter. Harris turned down the role three times but eventually accepted it because his 11-year-old granddaughter threatened to never speak to him again if he did not take it. Harris was determined to portray Dumbledore again in &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; (2004), despite having been diagnosed with Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, and asked David Heyman not to recast the role. However, his death in October 2002 necessitated recasting.

Christopher Lee was the producer&#x27;s immediate choice for replacing Harris, but scheduling conflicts due to Lee&#x27;s commitments as Saruman in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy and Count Dooku in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequels forced him to decline. Ian McKellen was also offered the role, but he turned it down, having played the similar character Gandalf in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, as well as feeling it would have been inappropriate to take Harris&#x27; role, as Harris had called McKellen a &quot;dreadful&quot; actor. Harris&#x27; family had expressed an interest in seeing Peter O&#x27;Toole being chosen as his replacement. Harry Robinson, who doubled for Harris in the first two films, and who also lent his voice in the first &quot;Harry Potter&quot; video game, was also considered for the role of Dumbledore. Four months after Harris&#x27;s death, Michael Gambon was cast as his replacement. Gambon adopted a slight Irish accent for the role. He plays the character in all the remaining &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films.

In flashback scenes in &quot;Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot; and &quot;Part 2&quot;, a young Dumbledore is portrayed by Toby Regbo. In the prequel films &quot;Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald&quot; (2018) and &quot;Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore&quot; (2022), Dumbledore is played by Jude Law.

==Characterisation==
===Outward appearance===
In the novels, Dumbledore is described as tall, thin and elderly. His hair and beard are long and silver. He has a long and crooked nose, long fingers and bright blue eyes. He wears half-moon spectacles and a colourful array of robes. He once claimed to have a scar above his left knee in the shape of a map of the London Underground. At some point between the fifth and sixth novels, Dumbledore puts on a cursed ring, which causes his right hand to become blackened and disfigured.

===Personality===
Dumbledore is described as benevolent and wise. His demeanour is often described as serene, ethereal and composed, and he rarely displays strong emotions. He is eccentric, slightly effeminate and fond of knitting. He is known for his odd displays of whimsicality, and he often uses humour to put others at ease. His eyes are sometimes described as twinkling with kindness or mischief. Dumbledore is highly perceptive and emotionally intelligent, and has a deep capacity for love. He sees the good in every person, and insists on giving people second chances. Dumbledore&#x27;s personality also has a more steely aspect. When he apprehends Barty Crouch Jr in &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;, the look upon his face is described as &quot;more terrible than Harry could have ever imagined.&quot; As Harry observes the &quot;cold fury&quot; in Dumbledore&#x27;s visage, he understands why Voldemort fears him.

In spite of Dumbledore&#x27;s many extraordinary qualities, he is a flawed character. According to Rowling, &quot;Although Dumbledore seems to be so benign for six books, he&#x27;s quite a Machiavellian figure, really. He&#x27;s been pulling a lot of strings.&quot; In a 2005 interview, Rowling commented: &quot;Immense brainpower does not protect you from emotional mistakes, and I think Dumbledore really exemplifies that.&quot; Dumbledore&#x27;s greatest flaw, which he admits to Harry, is his desire for power. He eventually finds that those best suited for power are those who do not seek it. When he and Grindelwald first meet, they make plans to enslave Muggles and re-establish wizards as the natural rulers of the world. However, Dumbledore becomes disillusioned of this fantasy after his sister Ariana is killed during a duel between himself, his brother Aberforth, and Grindelwald.

Dumbledore is riddled with guilt over the circumstances surrounding the death of his sister. He feels enormous remorse for his selfishness in getting involved in the circumstances that led to her death, and is tortured for the rest of his life by the possibility that he might have been the one who cast the spell that killed her. When he looks into the Mirror of Erised, he sees himself redeemed in the eyes of his brother and his entire family alive and together.

===Magical abilities and skills===
Dumbledore is considered by many characters to be the most powerful wizard alive. Some say he is the only wizard Voldemort ever feared. During his education at Hogwarts, Dumbledore was known as the most brilliant student to have ever stepped into the school, winning &quot;every prize of note that the school offered&quot;, and doing &quot;things with a wand [the examiner had] never seen before&quot;. Rowling has said that Dumbledore is primarily self-taught, although he &quot;had access to superb teachers at Hogwarts&quot;. Dumbledore readily acknowledges that he is unusually intelligent and an exceptionally powerful wizard. He admits a number of times to Harry in that he makes mistakes, and since he is smarter than most people, his mistakes &quot;tend to be correspondingly huger.&quot; Dumbledore is also skilled in Occlumency, Legilimency and Transfiguration.

===Possessions===
Dumbledore is the owner and master of the Elder Wand, an extremely powerful object which is one of the Deathly Hallows. He also has a pet phoenix named Fawkes. It is revealed in &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; by Mr. Ollivander that Harry&#x27;s wand carries a phoenix feather as its magical core and that particular phoenix only gave one other feather, the one in Voldemort&#x27;s wand that gave Harry his scar. It is later revealed in &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; that Fawkes was the phoenix whose feathers provide the magical core in Harry&#x27;s and Voldemort&#x27;s wands.

== Reception ==
The character of Albus Dumbledore has been compared to other archetypal &quot;wise old man&quot; characters. Dumbledore acts much like Merlin from &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;, in the manner of an &quot;absent-minded professor&quot;; both Merlin and Dumbledore educate a story&#x27;s main character in a castle. As writer Evelyn Perry notes, &quot;Dumbledore resembles Merlin both personally and physically; he is an avid lover of books and wisdom who wears flowing robes and a long, white beard.&quot; Dumbledore has also been compared with Gandalf from J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Dave Kopel draws comparisons between Rowling&#x27;s writing and John Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; and states that, among the Christian symbols that Rowling has used in her books, Dumbledore acts like &quot;the bearded God the Father&quot; figure in which Harry puts his faith to be saved from Voldemort and his servants. IGN also listed Dumbledore as their fifth favourite &quot;Harry Potter&quot; character, saying that &quot;[f]or a character that was introduced into popular culture a mere twelve years ago, it speaks volumes that Professor Dumbledore has already taken his place among the great mentor figures in literature and film&quot;. IGN&#x27;s Joe Utichi called Dumbledore his third favourite &quot;Harry Potter&quot; character, calling the revelation that he wasn&#x27;t so &quot;infallible&quot; one of the most heartbreaking themes of the final book. Actor Michael Gambon received some criticism for his louder, more aggressive, portrayal of the character, who is depicted as exhibiting a more subdued, unflappable calm in the books. This has been attributed to Gambon&#x27;s policy of not reading the source material from which his films are adapted.

As a main character of the series, major facts relating to Dumbledore have generated a vast number of essays and discussions. The death of Dumbledore at the end of &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot; was discussed by fans and critics alike. A website named DumbledoreIsNotDead.com sought to understand the events of the sixth book in a different way and provided arguments to claim that the character did not really die. However, Rowling confirmed on 2 August 2006 that Dumbledore was, in fact, dead, humorously apologising to the website as she did so. Along with DumbledoreIsNotDead.com, a collection of essays, &quot;Who Killed Albus Dumbledore?: What Really Happened in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince? Six Expert Harry Potter Detectives Examine the Evidence&quot;, was published by Zossima Press in November 2006. In NextMovie.com&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot; Mega Poll, Dumbledore&#x27;s death was voted as the most unforgettable moment in the whole series.

In the &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; DVD interview, screenwriter Steve Kloves stated that he considers Dumbledore a fascinating character because of the wisdom he provides, but he feels that &quot;Dumbledore bears such a tremendous dark burden, and he knows secrets and I think in many ways he bears the weight of the future of the wizard world&quot; and the &quot;only way that he can keep that at bay, the darkness, is to be whimsical and humorous&quot;.

===Sexuality===
In October 2007, while answering reader questions during a book reading at Carnegie Hall, Rowling was asked if Dumbledore had ever been in love. She answered, &quot;I always thought Dumbledore is gay&quot;. She discussed for the first time his romantic relationship with his rival Gellert Grindelwald, describing it as a &quot;great tragedy&quot;. She said she had informed David Yates, the director of &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;, of Dumbledore&#x27;s sexuality by writing a note in the screenplay. She had crossed out a section where Dumbledore describes his attraction to a woman, and had written &quot;Dumbledore is gay.&quot; When Yates learned about Dumbledore&#x27;s sexuality, he recalled thinking it was &quot;pretty cool&quot;. Michael Gambon, who portrays Dumbledore in six of the eight &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films, was reportedly amused by the revelation. Daniel Radcliffe, who plays Harry in the film series, found the news &quot;hilarious&quot;.

The revelation of Dumbledore&#x27;s sexuality occurred after the publication of the final novel, and made international news. Some gay rights activists and organizations praised Rowling, while others wished she had gone further to promote acceptance of homosexuality. A spokesman for the advocacy group Stonewall applauded the revelation, saying &quot;It&#x27;s great that JK has said this. It shows that there&#x27;s no limit to what gay and lesbian people can do, even being a wizard headmaster.&quot; The gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell welcomed the news about Dumbledore, but was disappointed that Rowling did not mention his sexuality in the novels. In an editorial for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the journalist James Ball wrote that depicting &quot;the respected, heroic and beloved Albus Dumbledore as [a] fully realised gay character—whose sexuality was merely incidental to his achievements—would have provided a fictional role model like no other. With homophobic bullying still such a significant issue in schools, this is a missed opportunity with a real sting in the tail.&quot; Writing for &quot;Time&quot;, John Cloud argued that Dumbledore&#x27;s silence about his sexuality implies that he is ashamed of it. Cloud claimed this silence &quot;suggests a lack of personal integrity that is completely out of character.&quot;

Melissa Anelli, the webmaster of the fan site The Leaky Cauldron, praised the revelation, saying it promoted tolerance towards homosexuality. She added, &quot;By dubbing someone so respected, so talented and so kind, as someone who just happens to be also homosexual, [Rowling is] reinforcing the idea that a person&#x27;s gayness is not something of which they should be ashamed.&quot; Mark Harris of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said Rowling&#x27;s choice &quot;to make a beloved professor-mentor gay in a world where gay teachers are still routinely slandered as malign influences was, I am certain, no accident.&quot; Mike Thomas of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; claimed that Rowling displayed great skill by writing a gay character without labelling him as gay. 

In a 2016 article, Aja Romano of &quot;Vox&quot; observed a critical stance among many &quot;Harry Potter&quot; fans towards Rowling&#x27;s revelation. Romano asserted that because Dumbledore&#x27;s homosexuality was revealed after his death, certain fans felt that Rowling contributed to a &quot;longstanding, problematic &#x27;dead gays&#x27; trope&quot; instead of showing the headmaster &quot;living out his queer identity&quot;. After the release of the film &quot;Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald&quot; (2018), Delia Harrington of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; criticised the film&#x27;s failure to mention Dumbledore&#x27;s homosexuality. She claimed that Rowling, who wrote the screenplay, put Dumbledore back in &quot;the closet&quot;. In a 2019 opinion piece in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Richard Morgan also expressed frustration that the headmaster is not portrayed as gay in the film. He quoted Matt Collette, the producer of the Nancy podcast, who had discussed the topic in a 2017 episode. Collette called Rowling a &quot;queerbaiter&quot;, which Collette defined as &quot;a writer who puts in just enough of a queer story line to appease the fans who&#x27;d like one, but not so much as to offend anyone who doesn&#x27;t like gay people.&quot;

Some critics argued that Dumbledore&#x27;s sexuality should not be considered canon. Edward Rothstein of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that &quot;Rowling may think of Dumbledore as gay&quot; but &quot;there is no reason why anyone else should&quot;. The student newspaper of East Tennessee State University accused Rowling of lying, claiming her revelation was a publicity stunt. Other critics quoted the Death of the Author principle; they claimed that Rowling&#x27;s commentary about characters after the novels were published is irrelevant to an understanding of the books.

In the third film in the series, &quot;Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore&quot; (2022), Dumbledore mentions that he was in love with Grindelwald, and tells other characters about their romantic relationship. After these lines were cut from the film&#x27;s Chinese release, the filmmakers faced additional criticism from fans.

<doc id="45323" wikidata="Q29273" url="?curid=45323" title="British Shorthair">
<text>The British Shorthair is the pedigree version of the traditional British domestic cat, with a distinctively stocky body, thick coat, and broad face. The most familiar colour variant is the &quot;British Blue&quot;, with a solid grey-blue coat, pineapple eyes, and a medium-sized tail. The breed has also been bred in a wide range of other colours and patterns, including tabby and colourpoint.

It is one of the most ancient cat breeds known. It remains the most popular pedigreed breed in its native country, as registered by the UK&#x27;s Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF). A quarter of all kittens registered with the GCCF each year are British Shorthairs, making the British the most popular pedigree cat in the UK.

The breed&#x27;s relatively calm temperament make it a frequent media star, notably as the inspiration for John Tenniel&#x27;s famous illustration of the Cheshire Cat from &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. The Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association profile reads: &quot;When gracelessness is observed, the British Shorthair is duly embarrassed, quickly recovering with a &#x27;Cheshire cat smile&#x27;.&quot;

== History ==
Researchers are not sure how cats first reached the British Isles. In many other parts of Europe cats became common at the same time as the spread of the Roman Empire, however it appears that housecats reached the British Isles before the Romans did.

These cats then interbred with the local European wildcat population. Over the centuries, their naturally isolated descendants developed into distinctively large, robust cats with a short but very thick coat, to better withstand conditions on their native islands. Based on artists&#x27; representations, the modern British Shorthair is unchanged from this initial type.

Selective breeding of the best examples of the type began in the nineteenth century, with emphasis on developing the unusual blue-grey variant called the &quot;British Blue&quot; or &quot;English type&quot; (to distinguish it from the more fine-boned &quot;Russian type&quot;). Some sources directly credit UK artist and pioneering cat fancier Harrison Weir with the initial concept of standardising the breed. Others suggest a group of breeders may have been involved. The new British Shorthair was featured at the first-ever cat show, organised by Weir and held at the Crystal Palace in London in 1871, and enjoyed great initial popularity.

By the 1900s with the advent of the newly imported Persian and other long-haired breeds, the British Shorthair had fallen out of favour, and breeding stock had become critically rare by World War I. At least partially to alleviate this, British Shorthair breeders mixed Persians into their bloodlines. The genes thus introduced would eventually become the basis for the British Longhair. At the time, any long-haired cats produced were placed into the Persian breeding program. As all cats with the blue colouration were then judged together as variants on a &quot;de facto&quot; single breed, the Blue Shorthair, outcrossings of the British with the Russian Blue were also common.

After the war, in an attempt to maintain the breed standard, the GCCF decided to accept only third-generation Persian/British Shorthair crosses. This contributed to another shortage of pure breeding stock by World War II, at which point the Persian and Russian Blue were reintroduced into the mix. 

British Shorthair breeders also worked with the French Chartreux, another ancient breed, which although genetically unrelated to the British Blue, is very similar in appearance. Breeders worked to reestablish the true British type, and by the late 1970s the distinctive British Shorthair had achieved formal recognition from both the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association (CFA) and The International Cat Association (TICA). According to the GCCF&#x27;s 2013 registry data, it is once again the most popular pedigreed breed in its native country.

== Description ==

=== Appearance ===

The British Shorthair is a relatively powerful-looking, large cat having a broad chest, strong thick-set legs with rounded paws, and a medium-length, blunt-tipped tail. The head is relatively large and rounded, with a short muzzle, broad cheeks (most noticeable in mature males, who tend to develop prominent jowls) and large round eyes that are deep copper orange in the British Blue and otherwise vary in colour depending on the coat. Their large ears are broad and widely set.

They are slow to mature in comparison with most cat breeds, reaching full physical development at approximately three years of age. Unusually among domestic cats, they are a noticeably sexually dimorphic breed, with males averaging and females .

=== Coat, colour, and patterns ===

The British Shorthair&#x27;s coat is one of the breed&#x27;s defining features. It is very dense, the texture being plush rather than woolly or fluffy, with a firm, &quot;crisp&quot; pile that breaks noticeably over the cat&#x27;s body as it moves.

Although the British Blue remains the most familiar variant, British Shorthairs have been developed in many other colours and patterns. Black, blue, white, red, cream, silver, golden and—most recently—cinnamon and fawn are accepted by all official standards, either solid or in colourpoint, tabby, shaded and bicolour patterns; the GCCF, FIFe and TICA also accept chocolate and its dilute lilac, disallowed in the CFA standard. All colours and patterns also have tortoiseshell variants.

The Tabby patterns include Classic Tabby, Mackerel Tabby, Spotted &amp; Ticked Tabby. The non-tabby patterns include: Tortoiseshell, Bi-Colour, Van patterns Bi-Colour &amp; White, Smoke, Tipped &amp; Colourpointed.

British Shorthair&#x27;s nose colour: black, cherry red, brick red; a circle of black nasal line on the periphery.

== Cat shows ==
First introduced to Britain by the Romans, the British shorthair was one of the domestic cats originally bred for its hunting prowess. In the last 150 years, breeding has emphasized physical qualities. The British Shorthair breed debuted — along with a wide range of other selectively bred felines — in the first organized cat show arranged by Harrison Weir at London&#x27;s Crystal Palace in 1871. British shorthairs remained the premiere pedigree at cat shows up until 1895.

Shortly after the British Shorthair exhibit in the Crystal Palace show, the popularity of British Shorthair increased. The public began searching for breeders of British Shorthairs with various character and color traits, all in the pursuit of &quot;exoticness&quot;. From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, certain British Shorthairs would occasionally earn notoriety or decorated titles in Cat Competitions. The British Shorthair publicity from 19th and 20th century cat shows helped British Shorthairs become one of the most popular pet cat breeds today. For example, in the 1980s, the British Shorthair was featured in competition by the Cat Fancier&#x27;s Association (CFA), which led to an increased demand for British Shorthairs as household pets. As of 2023, the British Shorthair ranks as the 6th most popular cat breed in the United States.

 the TICA cat show competition standards for British Shorthairs judge the cats for their circular head shape, muzzle, and cheeks. Small to medium ears are desired, with large, round, leveled eyes. Eye shape is more important than colour. The muzzle and chin shape should complement the circular face; the profile and nose should be short, further complementing the circular face. The neck should give the illusion of the cat having no neck, blending in with the cheeks. The body of the cat should have a sturdy and muscular torso, complemented by medium to short legs, finished with round medium to large feet. The tail should be thick at the base and taper to a rounded tip, totaling about two thirds of the body length. The cat should have substantial bone and a firm, sturdy musculature. No preference on colour is stated for the cat&#x27;s coat, but the coat should be straight, dense, and even in length.

==British Longhair==
The British Longhair, also known as the Highlander or Highland Straight, is a longhaired variant of the British Shorthair. Some registries such as The International Cat Association recognise it as a distinct breed, others such as the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy treat it as a variant of the British Shorthair, which may be referred to as simply &#x27;British&#x27;.

The breed is identical to the British Shorthair aside from its longer and denser coat.

== Health ==
A UK study looking at veterinary records found a life expectancy of 9.58 years for the British Shorthair and British Longhair compared to 11.74 years overall. Swedish insurance data puts the median lifespan of the breed at &gt;12.5 years. Eighty-two percent of British Shorthairs lived to 10 years or more, and 54% lived to 12.5 years or more.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) can be a problem in the breed. A Danish prevalence study with more than 329 cats showed that 20.4% of males and 2.1% of the females had HCM, with an additional 6.4% of males and 3.5% of females judged to be equivocal.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1111/j.1939-1676.2011.0751.x&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; HCM testing of males used for breeding is now mandatory for breeders organised under the Danish Fife member, Felis Danica.

The breed is thought to be at high risk of polycystic kidney disease (PKD).

A study of over 190,000 patient records in England found the British Shorthair to be less than half as likely to acquire diabetes mellitus as either moggies or the overall cat population; 0.24% of British Shorthairs were diagnosed with the condition compared to 0.58% for both non-pedigree cats and the overall prevalence.

== Commemoration ==
In 2022, the British Shorthair was one of eight cats featured on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail.

<text>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry () is a fictional boarding school of magic for young wizards. It is the primary setting for the first six novels in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series by J. K. Rowling, and also serves as a major setting in the &quot;Wizarding World&quot; media franchise.

In the novels, Hogwarts is described as a coeducational, secondary boarding school that enrolls children from ages eleven to eighteen. According to Rowling, any child in Britain who shows magical ability is invited to attend the school. The Wizarding World website states that Hogwarts was founded in the Highlands of Scotland sometime between the 9th and 10th century by Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin. Rowling has offered varying accounts of how many students are enrolled at Hogwarts at any given time.

In a 1999 interview, Rowling said she envisioned Hogwarts as a place that offers security to the orphaned Harry Potter. She said that she made Hogwarts a boarding school because many important plot events occur at night. Several writers have suggested that Rowling took the name &quot;Hogwarts&quot; from the 1954 book &quot;How to Be Topp&quot; by Geoffrey Willans. The book describes a fictional play titled &quot;The Hogwarts&quot; and a fictional school headmaster named &quot;Hoggwart&quot;. Rowling, however, said she may have unknowingly derived the name &quot;Hogwarts&quot; from the name of the hogwort plant.

==Castle and grounds==
Students travel to and from Hogwarts through a steam powered train, known as &quot;Hogwarts Express&quot;.

Rowling has described Hogwarts as a &quot;huge, rambling, quite scary-looking castle, with a jumble of towers and battlements&quot;. She said the castle is supported by magic. The school grounds have sloping lawns, vegetable gardens and greenhouses. There is a pitch for playing the wizard sport Quidditch, and a large wooded area known as the Forbidden Forest. There is also a lake, which is home to merpeople, grindylows and a giant squid. Wizards cannot Apparate (teleport) on Hogwarts grounds, but there are several hidden passages that lead out of the school. In &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; (2000), it is explained that Muggles (non-magical people) cannot see Hogwarts because there are numerous enchantments on it.

A subterranean area of the castle known as the Chamber of Secrets is introduced in the second novel, &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; (1998). In the novel, the young student Ginny Weasley is forced to open the Chamber by the Dark wizard Voldemort. From the Chamber emerges a deadly Basilisk, which attacks students until Harry kills it. A magical room called the is also located in Hogwarts. It only appears when someone needs it, and contains whatever the person requires. In &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot; (2003), Harry holds meetings of his student group Dumbledore&#x27;s Army in the Room of Requirement. In &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot; (2005), Draco Malfoy uses the room to hide and repair a Vanishing Cabinet, which allows him to smuggle Voldemort&#x27;s Death Eaters into Hogwarts.

== Houses ==
When a first-year student arrives at Hogwarts, the magical Sorting Hat is placed on their head. It examines their mind and assigns them to a House based on their abilities, personality, and preferences. Hogwarts has four Houses, each named after one of the founders of the school. Throughout the school year, the Houses compete for the House Cup, gaining and losing points based on actions such as performance in class and rule violations. The House with the highest end-of-year total wins and has its colours displayed in the Great Hall during the following school year. Each House also has its own Quidditch team that competes for the Quidditch Cup. Each House is under the authority of one of the Hogwarts professors. The four Houses are described below.

* values courage, nerve, and chivalry. Gryffindor&#x27;s mascot is a lion, and the Head of House is Minerva McGonagall. The Gryffindor dormitories are in a high tower, and students must use a password to gain entry. According to Rowling, Gryffindor corresponds roughly to the element of fire.
* values hard work, patience, justice, and loyalty. Hufflepuff&#x27;s mascot is a badger, and the Head of House is Pomona Sprout. Rowling said that Hufflepuff corresponds roughly to the element of earth.
* values intelligence, learning, wisdom, and wit. The house mascot is an eagle in the novels and a raven in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and &quot;Fantastic Beasts&quot; films. In the novels, the Head of Ravenclaw House is Filius Flitwick. The dormitories are in Ravenclaw Tower, and students must solve a riddle to gain entry. Ravenclaw corresponds roughly to the element of air.
* values ambition, cunning, leadership, and resourcefulness. The mascot of Slytherin is a serpent. Severus Snape is the Head of Slytherin House until he becomes headmaster, at which point Horace Slughorn assumes the position. The Slytherin dormitories are accessed by speaking a password in front of a stone wall in the dungeons, which causes a hidden door to open. Slytherin corresponds roughly to the element of water.

Each year, two fifth-year students from each House are selected as prefects. The position grants them certain privileges and the authority to give detentions for infractions. The leaders of the student body, the head girl and head boy, are chosen from among the seventh-year students. Hogwarts students in their third year or higher are allowed to visit the nearby wizarding village of Hogsmeade.

== Subjects ==
The novels mention twelve subjects which are taught at Hogwarts. Astronomy, Charms, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Herbology, History of Magic, Potions, and Transfiguration are required subjects for the first five years. At the start of their third year, students must choose at least two additional subjects. The five elective subjects are Ancient Runes, Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Divination and Muggle Studies. Students must also take flying lessons during their first year, and may take Apparition lessons during their sixth year. 

* is a generally theoretical subject that studies ancient runic scripts. It is taught by Bathsheda Babbling.
* (also known as numerology) is a branch of magic concerned with the magical properties of numbers. It is a favourite subject of Hermione Granger. Arithmancy is taught by Septima Vector.
* classes are held in the Astronomy tower and are taught by Aurora Sinistra. Lessons involve observation of the night sky with telescopes.
* teaches students how to care for magical beasts. During Harry&#x27;s first two years at Hogwarts, the class is taught by Silvanus Kettleburn. Starting in Harry&#x27;s third year, Rubeus Hagrid is the professor. When Hagrid is absent, the class is taught by Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank.
* is the class that teaches incantations for bewitchment. Rowling has described Charms as a type of magic concerned with giving objects new properties. Charms lessons are described in the novels as frequently noisy and chaotic. The subject is taught by Filius Flitwick.
* teaches practical techniques to defend against the magical Dark Arts. Throughout the series, the class is taught at various points by Quirinus Quirrell, Gilderoy Lockhart, Remus Lupin, Barty Crouch Jr (impersonating Alastor &quot;Mad-eye&quot; Moody), Dolores Umbridge, Severus Snape, and Amycus Carrow. Due to the fact that no professor remains in the position for more than a year, the Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore suggests that Voldemort jinxed the subject because his application to teach it was rejected. The existence of this jinx was eventually confirmed by Rowling. She said in an interview that after Voldemort dies, the jinx is lifted and a new professor teaches the subject for many years. In &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, Defence Against the Dark Arts is renamed &quot;Dark Arts&quot; when the Death Eaters take control of Hogwarts.
* is the art of predicting the future. The various methods of divination described in the novels include astrology, cartomancy, crystal ball consultation, dream interpretation, fire omens, palmistry, and reading tea leaves. Divination is described by Minerva McGonagall as &quot;one of the most imprecise branches of magic&quot;. Some wizards claim that the practice is fraudulent. Divination is taught by Sybill Trelawney.
* is the study of magical plants and how to utilise, care for and combat them. The novels describe at least three Hogwarts greenhouses, which contain a variety of magical plants. The course is taught by Pomona Sprout.
* is the study of magical and wizarding history. The subject is taught by the ghost professor Cuthbert Binns, whose lessons are depicted as some of the most boring at Hogwarts. His lectures cover topics such as goblin rebellions, giant wars and the origins of wizarding secrecy.
* is a class that involves the study of Muggle culture from a wizarding point of view. Charity Burbage teaches Muggle Studies until she is murdered by Voldemort in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;. When the Death Eaters take control of Hogwarts, Alecto Carrow teaches the class. Her compulsory lessons describe Muggles and Muggle-borns as subhuman and worthy of persecution.
* is the art of creating mixtures with magical effects. It requires correct mixing and stirring of ingredients in the proper sequence and at the proper temperature. The subject is taught by Severus Snape during the first five novels and by Horace Slughorn in the final two books.
* is the art of changing the properties of an object or being. Transfiguration can alter an entire object or only part of the object. It can make objects vanish and it can conjure them out of thin air. Transfiguration can also change inanimate objects into animate ones and vice versa. The subject is taught by Minerva McGonagall.
* is the class that teaches students how to fly on broomsticks.
* is a form of teleportation which allows a wizard to disappear (&quot;Disapparate&quot;) from one location and reappear (&quot;Apparate&quot;) in another. A wizard must be at least 17 years old to Apparate. Students at Hogwarts may take Apparition lessons during their sixth year. &quot;For further information, see&quot; &quot;Magic in&quot; &quot;Harry Potter&quot;.

==In film==
Hogwarts is featured in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film adaptations. England&#x27;s Alnwick Castle was used for many scenes depicting exterior parts of the school. Shots of the entire school were created by adding a digital spire to images of Durham Cathedral, which also served as a set for the interior of Hogwarts. A detailed scale model of Hogwarts was also used during production of the films.

== Cultural impact ==
In 2008, the Independent Schools Network Rankings website featured Hogwarts on a list of the best schools in Scotland. Frank Tiarks, the managing director of the website, said Hogwarts was included on the list for fun. Rowling&#x27;s fictional school was ranked as the 36th-best school, surpassing Edinburgh&#x27;s Loretto School.

<doc id="45330" wikidata="Q5925" url="?curid=45330" title="Orange County, California">
<text>Orange County (officially the County of Orange; often known by its initials O.C.) is a county located in the Los Angeles metropolitan area in Southern California, United States. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 3,186,989, making it the third-most-populous county in California, the sixth-most-populous in the United States, and more populous than 19 American states and Washington, D.C. Although largely suburban, it is the second-most-densely-populated county in the state behind San Francisco County. The county&#x27;s three most-populous cities are Anaheim, Santa Ana, and Irvine, each of which has a population exceeding 300,000. Santa Ana is also the county seat. Six cities in Orange County are on the Pacific coast: Seal Beach, Huntington Beach, Newport Beach, Laguna Beach, Dana Point, and San Clemente.

Orange County is included in the Los Angeles–Long Beach–Anaheim Metropolitan Statistical Area. The county has 34 incorporated cities. Older cities like Tustin, Santa Ana, Anaheim, Orange, and Fullerton have traditional downtowns dating back to the 19th century, while newer commercial development or &quot;edge cities&quot; stretch along the Interstate 5 (Santa Ana) Freeway between Disneyland and Santa Ana and between South Coast Plaza and the Irvine Business Complex, and cluster at Irvine Spectrum. Although single-family homes make up the dominant landscape of most of the county, northern and central Orange County is relatively more urbanized and dense as compared to those areas south of Irvine, which are less dense, though still contiguous and primarily suburban rather than exurban.

The county is a tourist center, with attractions like Disneyland Resort, Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm, Mission San Juan Capistrano, Huntington Beach Pier, the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum, Modjeska House, Segerstrom Center for the Arts, Yost Theater, Bowers Museum, Balboa Island, Angel Stadium, Downtown Santa Ana, Crystal Cove Historic District, the Honda Center, the Old Orange County Courthouse, the Irvine Ranch Natural Landmarks, and several popular beaches along its more than of coastline. It is also home to a major research university, the University of California, Irvine (UCI), along with a number of other notable colleges and universities such as Chapman University and Cal State Fullerton.

==History==

=== Indigenous ===

Archeological evidence shows the area to have been inhabited beginning about 9,500 years ago. At the time of European contact, the northern area of what is now Orange County was primarily inhabited by the Tongva indigenous people, a part of Tovaangar, while the southern area of the county, below Aliso Creek, was primarily inhabited by the Acjachemen. Both groups lived in villages throughout the area. Large villages were sometimes multiethnic and multilingual, such as Genga, located in what is now Newport Beach. The village was shared by the Tongva and Acjachemen. The village of Puhú was located in what is now Black Star Canyon and was shared by multiple groups, including the Tongva, Acjachemen, Serrano and Payómkawichum.

The mother village of the Acjachemen was Putiidhem and is now located in San Juan Capistrano underneath Junipero Serra Catholic High School. For the Tongva, north Orange County was at the southern extent of their village sites. In coastal villages like Lupukngna, at least 3,000 years old located in what is now Huntington Beach, villagers likely used te&#x27;aats or plank boats to navigate the coastline, with fish and shellfish being more central to the diet. In inland villages such as Hutuknga, rabbit and mule deer were more central, in addition to acorns from oak trees and seeds from grasses and sage bushes common everywhere.

=== Spanish mission period ===
After the 1769 expedition of Gaspar de Portolà, a Spanish expedition led by Junipero Serra named the area Valle de Santa Ana (Valley of Saint Anne). On November 1, 1776, Mission San Juan Capistrano became the area&#x27;s first permanent European settlement. Among those who came with Portolá were José Manuel Nieto and José Antonio Yorba. Both these men were given land grants—Rancho Los Nietos and Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana, respectively.

The Nieto heirs were granted land in 1834. The Nieto ranches were known as Rancho Los Alamitos, Rancho Las Bolsas, and Rancho Los Coyotes. Yorba heirs Bernardo Yorba and Teodosio Yorba were also granted Rancho Cañón de Santa Ana (Santa Ana Canyon Ranch) and Rancho Lomas de Santiago, respectively. Other ranchos in Orange County were granted by the Mexican government during the Mexican period in Alta California.

Saint Junípero Serra y Ferrer and the early components of the Portolá Expedition arrived in modern-day San Diego, south of present-day Orange County, in mid-late 1769. During these early Mission years, however, the early immigrants continued to rely on imports of both Mexican-grown and Spanish-grown wines; Serra repeatedly complained of the process of repeated, labored import. The first grape crop production was produced in 1782 at San Juan Capistrano, with vines potentially brought through supply ships in 1778.

=== 19th century ===
Viticulture became an increasingly important crop in Los Angeles and Orange Counties through the subsequent decades. By the 1850s, the regions supported more than 100 vineyards. In 1857, Anaheim was founded by 50 German-Americans (with lineage extending back to Franconia) in search of a suitable grape-growing region. This group purchased a parcel from Juan Pacifico Ontiveros&#x27;s Rancho San Juan Cajon de Santa Ana for $2 per acre and later formed the Anaheim Vineyard Company. With surveyor George Hansen, two of the wine colony&#x27;s founders, John Frohling and Charles Kohler, planted 400,000 grapevines along the Santa Ana River; by 1875, &quot;there were as many as 50 wineries in Anaheim, and the city&#x27;s wine production topped 1 million gallons annually.&quot; Despite later afflictions of both Phylloxera and Pierce&#x27;s Disease, wine growing is still practiced.

A severe drought in the 1860s devastated the prevailing industry, cattle ranching, and much land came into the possession of Richard O&#x27;Neill Sr. James Irvine and other land barons. In 1887, silver was discovered in the Santa Ana Mountains, attracting settlers via the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific Railroads. High rates of Anglo migration gradually moved Mexicans into &quot;colonias&quot;, or segregated ethnic enclaves.

==== County establishment ====

After several failed attempts in previous sessions, the California State Legislature passed a bill authorizing the portion of Los Angeles County south of Coyote Creek to hold a referendum on whether to remain part of Los Angeles County or to secede and form a new county to be named &quot;Orange&quot; as directed by the legislature. The referendum required a 2/3 vote for secession to take place, and on June 4, 1889, the vote was 2,509 to 500 in favor of secession. After the referendum, Los Angeles County filed three lawsuits to prevent the secession, but their attempts were futile.

On July 17, 1889, a second referendum was held south of the Coyote Creek to determine if the county seat of the new county would be Anaheim or Santa Ana, along with an election for every county officer. Santa Ana defeated Anaheim in the referendum. With the referendum having passed, the County of Orange was officially incorporated on August 1, 1889. Since the incorporation of the county, the only geographical changes made to the boundary was when the County and Los Angeles County traded some parcels of land around Coyote Creek to conform to city blocks.

The county is said to have been named for the citrus fruit in an attempt to promote immigration by suggesting a semi-tropical paradise – a place where anything could grow.

In 1919, the California State Legislature redefined the county&#x27;s boundary with Los Angeles County to no longer follow Coyote Creek but instead along Public Land Survey System township lines instead.

=== 20th century ===

Other citrus crops, avocados, and oil extraction were also important to the early economy. Orange County benefited from the July 4, 1904, completion of the Pacific Electric Railway, a trolley connecting Los Angeles with Santa Ana and Newport Beach. The link made Orange County an accessible weekend retreat for celebrities of early Hollywood. It was deemed so significant that Pacific City changed its name to Huntington Beach in honor of Henry E. Huntington, president of the Pacific Electric and nephew of Collis Huntington. Transportation further improved with the completion of the State Route and U.S. Route 101 (now mostly Interstate 5) in the 1920s.
In the 1910s, agriculture in Orange County was largely centered on grains, hay, and potatoes by small farmers, accounting for 60% of the county&#x27;s exports. The Segerstroms and Irvines once produced so many lima beans that the county was called &quot;Beanville&quot;. By 1920, fruit and nut exports exploded, which led to the increase of industrialized farming and the decline of family farms. For example, by 1917, William Chapman came to own 350,000 acres in northeastern Orange County from the Valencia orange. Around the 1910s and 1920s, most of the &quot;barrios&quot; of Orange County, such as in Santa Ana, further developed as company towns of Mexican laborers, who worked in the industrial orange groves. Poor working conditions resulted in the Citrus Strike of 1936, in which more than half of the orange industry&#x27;s workforce, largely Mexican, demanded better working conditions. The strike was heavily repressed, with forced evictions and state-sanctioned violence being used as tactics of suppression. Carey McWilliams referred to the suppression as &quot;the toughest violation of civil rights in the nation.&quot;

The Los Angeles flood of 1938 devastated some areas of Orange County, with most of the effects being in Santa Ana and Anaheim, which were flooded with six feet of water. As an eight-foot-high rush of water further spilled out of the Santa Ana Canyon, forty-three people were killed in the predominately Mexican communities of Atwood and La Jolla in Placentia. The devastation from this event, as well as from the 1939 California tropical storm, meant that Orange County was in need of new infrastructure, which was supported by the New Deal. This included the construction of numerous schools, city halls, post offices, parks, libraries, and fire stations, as well as the improvement of road infrastructure throughout Orange County.

School segregation between Mexican and white students in Orange County was widespread in the mid-1940s, with 80% of Mexican students attending 14 segregated schools. These schools taught Mexican children manual education – or gardening, bootmaking, blacksmithing, and carpentry for Mexican boys and sewing and homemaking for girls – while white schools taught academic preparation. The landmark case Mendez vs. Westminster (1947) desegregated Orange County schools, after the Mendez family were denied enrollment into the 17th Street School in Westminster in 1944, despite their cousins with lighter skin being admitted, and were instead told to enroll at the Hoover Elementary School for Mexican children.

In the 1950s, agriculture, such as that involving the boysenberries made famous by Buena Park native Walter Knott, began to decline. However, the county&#x27;s prosperity soared during this time. The completion of Interstate 5 in 1954 helped make Orange County a bedroom community for many who moved to Southern California to work in aerospace and manufacturing. Orange County received a further economic boost in 1955 with the opening of Disneyland.

In 1969, Yorba Linda-born Orange County native Richard Nixon became the 37th President of the United States. He established a &quot;Western White House&quot; in San Clemente, in South Orange County, known as La Casa Pacifica, and visited throughout his presidency.

In the late 1970s, Vietnamese and Latino immigrants began to populate central Orange County.

In the 1980s, Orange County had become the second most populous county in California as the population topped two million for the first time.

In the 1990s, red foxes became common in Orange County as a non-native mesopredator, with increasing urban development pushing out coyote and mountain lion populations to the county&#x27;s shrinking natural areas.

In 1994, an investment fund meltdown led to the criminal prosecution of treasurer Robert Citron. The county lost at least $1.5 billion through high-risk investments in bonds. The loss was blamed on derivatives by some media reports. On December 6, 1994, the County of Orange declared Chapter 9 bankruptcy, from which it emerged on June 12, 1996. The Orange County bankruptcy was at the time the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.

Land use conflicts arose between established areas in the north and less developed areas in the south. These conflicts were over issues such as construction of new toll roads and the repurposing of a decommissioned air base. El Toro Marine Corps Air Station was designated by a voter measure in 1994 to be developed into an international airport to complement the existing John Wayne Airport. But subsequent voter initiatives and court actions caused the airport plan to be permanently shelved. It has developed into the Orange County Great Park and housing.

=== 21st century ===
In the 21st century, the social landscape of Orange County has continued to change. The opioid epidemic saw a rise in Orange County, with unintentional overdoses becoming the third highest contributor of deaths by 2014. As in other areas, the deaths disproportionately occurred in the homeless population. However, deaths were widespread among affluent and poorer areas in Orange County, with the highest at-risk group being Caucasian males between the ages of 45–55. A 2018 study found that supply reduction was not sufficient to preventing deaths.

In 2008, a report issued by the Orange County Superior Court found that the county was experiencing a pet &quot;overpopulation problem,&quot; with the growing number of pets leading to an increase in euthanasias at the Orange County Animal Shelter to 13,000 for the year alone.

Following the 2016 presidential election, Santa Ana become a sanctuary city for the protection of those immigrants who worked around the legally established process of becoming a legal resident in Orange and other California counties. This created an intense debate in Orange County surrounding politics toward unlawful immigration, with many cities opposing pro-immigration policies.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Orange County disproportionately affected lower income and Latino residents.

Implementation of renewable energy and climate change awareness in Orange County increased, with the city of Irvine pledging to be a zero-carbon economy by 2030 and Buena Park, Huntington Beach, and Fullerton pledging to move to 100% clean energy. Residential solar panel installation has rapidly increased, even among middle-income families, as a result of the state&#x27;s residential solar program which began in 2006.

In the 2010s, campaigns to conserve remaining natural areas gained awareness. By the early 2020s, some success was found, with the conservation of 24 acres in the West Coyote Hills of a total 510 acres and the Genga/Banning Ranch project moving forward, conserving some 385 acres, which was part of the Tongva village area of Genga. In 2021, the commemorative 1.5 acre Putuidem village opened after years of delays and campaigning by the Acjachemen.

==Geography==


According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (16.6%) is water. It is the smallest county by area in Southern California, being just over 40% the size of the region&#x27;s next smallest county, Ventura. The average annual temperature is about .

Orange County is bordered on the southwest by the Pacific Ocean, on the north by Los Angeles County, on the northeast by San Bernardino County, on the east by Riverside County, and on the southeast by San Diego County.

The northwestern part of the county lies on the coastal plain of the Los Angeles Basin, while the southeastern end rises into the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains. Most of Orange County&#x27;s population reside in one of two shallow coastal valleys that lie in the basin, the Santa Ana Valley and the Saddleback Valley. The Santa Ana Mountains lie within the eastern boundaries of the county and of the Cleveland National Forest. The high point is Santiago Peak (), about east of Santa Ana. Santiago Peak and nearby Modjeska Peak, just shorter, form a ridge known as Saddleback, visible from almost everywhere in the county. The Peralta Hills extend westward from the Santa Ana Mountains through the communities of Anaheim Hills, Orange, and ending in Olive. The Loma Ridge is another prominent feature, running parallel to the Santa Ana Mountains through the central part of the county, separated from the taller mountains to the east by Santiago Canyon.

The Santa Ana River is the county&#x27;s principal watercourse, flowing through the middle of the county from northeast to southwest. Its major tributary to the south and east is Santiago Creek. Other watercourses within the county include Aliso Creek, San Juan Creek, and Horsethief Creek. In the North, the San Gabriel River also briefly crosses into Orange County and exits into the Pacific on the Los Angeles-Orange County line between the cities of Long Beach and Seal Beach. Laguna Beach is home to the county&#x27;s only natural lakes, Laguna Lakes, which are formed by water rising up against an underground fault.

===Regions of Orange County===

Orange County is sometimes divided into northern and southern regions. There are significant political, demographic, economic and cultural distinctions between North and South Orange County. A popular dividing line between the two regions is the Costa Mesa Freeway.

Northern Orange County, including Anaheim, Fullerton, Garden Grove and Santa Ana, was the first part of the county to be developed and is culturally closer to neighboring Los Angeles County. This region is more Hispanic (mostly Mexican) and Asian (predominantly Vietnamese and Korean), more densely populated (Santa Ana is the one hundredth and one most densely-populated city in the United States with a population of over 300,000), younger, less wealthy and with higher unemployment. It has more renters and fewer homeowners and generally votes Democratic. There are notable exceptions to these general trends, such as strongly Republican Yorba Linda and affluent Anaheim Hills, North Tustin, and Villa Park. Northern Orange County is predominantly flat, giving way to the Santa Ana Mountains in the Northeast.

Southern Orange County is wealthier, more residential, more Republican, predominantly non-Hispanic white, and more recently developed. Irvine, the largest city in the region, is an exception to some of these trends, being not only a major employment center, but also a major tech hub and education center with UCI. Furthermore, the city is an Asian plurality (both South and East Asian), and votes reliably Democratic in recent years. Southern Orange County almost always includes Irvine, Newport Beach, and the cities to their southeast, including Lake Forest, Laguna Niguel, Laguna Beach, Mission Viejo, and San Clemente. Alternatively, Irvine and Newport Beach are sometimes seen as Central Orange County, acting as a transition zone between north and south; when this viewpoint is taken Tustin is also considered to be in Central Orange County. Costa Mesa is sometimes included in South County, although it is located predominantly to the west of the Costa Mesa Freeway and is part of the even street grid network of northern Orange County. Irvine is located in a valley defined by the Santa Ana Mountains and the San Joaquin Hills, while much of Southern Orange County is very hilly.

Another region of Orange County is the Orange Coast, which includes the six cities bordering the Pacific Ocean. These are, from northwest to southeast: Seal Beach, Huntington Beach, Newport Beach, Laguna Beach, Dana Point and San Clemente, although Seal Beach is sometimes viewed as an extension of neighboring Long Beach in Los Angeles County.

===Commercial districts and edge cities===

Older cities in North Orange County like Santa Ana, Anaheim, Orange and Fullerton have traditional downtowns dating to the late 19th century, with Downtown Santa Ana being the home of the county, state and federal institutions. However, far more commercial activity is concentrated in clusters of newer commercial development located further south in the county&#x27;s edge cities. The three largest edge cities, from north to south, are:
*Anaheim–Santa Ana, running along Interstate 5 between Disneyland and Downtown Santa Ana,
*The South Coast Metro, located along Interstate 405 and including South Coast Plaza, John Wayne Airport and the Irvine Business Complex; and
*Irvine Spectrum in eastern Irvine, at the interchange where I-5 and I-405 meet.

====Anaheim—Santa Ana edge city====
A contiguous strip of commercial development (an edge city) stretches from Disneyland through to MainPlace Mall along the I-5 Santa Ana Freeway, straddling the city limits of Anaheim, Garden Grove, Orange, and Santa Ana, and in fact stretching between the original downtowns of those four cities.

Entertainment and cultural facilities include Disneyland Resort, Angel Stadium, Christ Cathedral (formerly Crystal Cathedral), City National Grove of Anaheim – a live concert venue, Discovery Cube Orange County, the Honda Center – home to the Anaheim Ducks of the NHL (National Hockey League), and the Anaheim Convention Center. Health care facilities include CHOC (Children&#x27;s Hospital of Orange County), Kaiser Permanente Health Pavilion (Anaheim), St. Joseph Hospital (Orange), and the UCI Medical Center.

Retail complexes include Anaheim GardenWalk, Anaheim Marketplace (claiming to be the largest indoor swap meet in Orange County with more than 200 vendors), MainPlace Mall, Orange Town &amp; Country, and The Outlets at Orange, originally a mall named &quot;The City&quot; which was the centerpiece of a planned, 1970s mixed-use development by the same name. There is commercial strip-style development including big box retailers along West Chapman Avenue in Orange, along Harbor Boulevard in Garden Grove, and around Harbor Boulevard and Chapman Avenue in Anaheim.

Major hotels line Harbor Boulevard from Disneyland south to Garden Grove. The Orange County Transit Authority studied the corridor as the possible route for a streetcar, a proposal that was dropped in 2018 due to opposition from Anaheim and other city governments.

In addition to suburban-style apartment complexes, Anaheim&#x27;s Platinum Triangle is undergoing transformation from a low-density commercial and industrial zone into a more urban environment with high-density housing, commercial office towers, and retail space. Anaheim envisions it as a &quot;downtown for Orange County&quot;. The area undergoing this large-scale redevelopment includes the city&#x27;s two major sports venues, the Honda Center and Angel Stadium of Anaheim.

In 2005, new owner Arte Moreno wanted to change the name to &quot;Los Angeles Angels&quot; in order to better tap into the Los Angeles media market, the second largest in the country. However, the standing agreement with the city of Anaheim demanded that they have &quot;Anaheim&quot; in the name, so they became the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. This name change was hotly disputed by the city of Anaheim, but the change stood, which prompted a lawsuit by the city of Anaheim against Arte Moreno, won by the latter. Prior to the 2016 season Moreno and the club officially dropped the Anaheim moniker now simply going by the Los Angeles Angels.

===Pension scandal===
On July 12, 2010, it was revealed that former Sheriff Mike Carona received over $215,000 in pension checks in 2009, despite his felony conviction. A 2005 state law denied a public pension to public officials convicted of wrongdoing in office, however, that law only applied to benefits accrued after December 2005. Carona became eligible for his pension at age 50, and is also entitled, by law, to medical and dental benefits. It was noted that the county&#x27;s retirement system faces a massive shortfall totaling $3.7 billion unfunded liabilities, and Carona was one of approximately 400 retired Orange County public servants who received more than $100,000 in benefits in 2009. Also on the list of those receiving extra-large pension checks is former treasurer-tax collector Robert Citron, whose investments, which were made while consulting psychics and astrologers, led Orange County into bankruptcy in 1994.

Citron, a Democrat, funneled billions of public dollars into questionable investments, and at first the returns were high and cities, schools and special districts borrowed millions to join in the investments. But the strategy backfired, and Citron&#x27;s investment pool lost $1.64 billion. Nearly $200 million had to be slashed from the county budget and more than 1,000 jobs were cut. The county was forced to borrow $1 billion.

The California Foundation for Fiscal Responsibility filed a lawsuit against the pension system to get the list. The agency had claimed that pensioner privacy would be compromised by the release. A judge approved the release and the documents were released late June 2010. The release of the documents has reopened debate on the pension plan for retired public safety workers approved in 2001 when Carona was sheriff.

Called &quot;3 percent at 50,&quot; it lets deputies retire at age 50 with 3 percent of their highest year&#x27;s pay for every year of service. Before it was approved and applied retroactively, employees received 2 percent. &quot;It was right after Sept. 11,&quot; said Orange County Supervisor John Moorlach. &quot;All of a sudden, public safety people became elevated to god status. The Board of Supervisors were tripping over themselves to make the motion.&quot; He called it &quot;one of the biggest shifts of money from the private sector to the public sector.&quot; Moorlach, who was not on the board when the plan was approved, led the fight to repeal the benefit. A lawsuit, which said the benefit should go before voters, was rejected in Los Angeles County Superior Court in 2009 and is now under appeal. Carona opposed the lawsuit when it was filed, likening its filing to a &quot;nuclear bomb&quot; for deputies.

==Politics==
During most of the 20th century and up until 2016, Orange County was known for its political conservatism and for being a bastion for the Republican Party, with a 2005 academic study listing three Orange County cities as among America&#x27;s 25 most conservative. However, the county&#x27;s changing demographics have coincided with a shift in political alignments, making it far more competitive in recent years. In 2016, Hillary Clinton became the first Democrat since 1936 to carry Orange County in a presidential election and in the 2018 midterm elections the Democratic Party gained control of every Congressional seat in the county. Although Democrats controlled all congressional districts in Orange County at the time, Republicans maintained a lead in voter registration numbers (although it shrunk to less than a percentage point as of February 10, 2019, as compared with over 10% on February 10, 2013). The number of registered Democrats surpassed the number of registered Republicans in the county in August 2019. As the number of Democrats increased, the number of voters not aligned with a political party increased to comprise 27.4% of the county&#x27;s voters in 2019. Republicans held a majority on the county Board of Supervisors until 2022, when Democrats established a 3–2 control of the body. Seven out of the 12 state legislators from Orange County are also Republicans.

===Political history===
From the mid-20th century until the 2010s, Orange County was known as a Republican stronghold and consistently sent Republican representatives to the state and federal legislatures—so strongly so, that Ronald Reagan described it as the place that &quot;all the good Republicans go to die.&quot; Republican majorities in Orange County helped deliver California&#x27;s electoral votes to Republican nominees Richard Nixon in 1960, 1968, and 1972; Gerald Ford in 1976; Reagan in 1980 and 1984; and George H. W. Bush in 1988. It was one of five counties in the state that voted for Barry Goldwater in 1964.

In 1936, Orange County gave Franklin D. Roosevelt a majority of its presidential vote. The Republican nominee won Orange County by double digits in the next seventeen presidential elections. Orange County&#x27;s Republican registration reached its apex in 1991, 55.6% of registered voters. But with the 2008 election it began trending Democratic until Hillary Clinton won the county with an eight-point majority in 2016. In 2020, Joe Biden further improved slightly on Clinton&#x27;s 2016 margin of victory. In 2023, the Republican party&#x27;s registration was 33%, while the Democratic party&#x27;s registration was 37.5%. In 2024, Orange County again voted for the Democratic nominee and California native Kamala Harris, though Harris only won a plurality by a smaller margin than Biden or Hillary Clinton.














The Republican margin began to narrow in the 1990s and 2000s as the state trended Democratic until the mid- to late-2010s when it voted for the Democratic Party in 2016 and in 2018, when the Democratic party won every United States House District anchored in the county, including four that had previously been held by Republicans. This prompted media outlets to declare Orange County&#x27;s Republican leanings &quot;dead&quot;, with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; running an op-ed titled, &quot;An obituary to old Orange County, dead at age 129.&quot; While Republicans were able to recapture two of the seven U.S. House seats in Orange County in 2020, Democrats continued to hold the other five, Biden won the county by a slightly greater margin than Clinton had, and Democrats received a majority of the votes in each of the seven congressional districts. Republicans still carry more weight at the local level, and in 2020 for the State Assembly elections, they won 50.2% of the vote and four out of seven seats of the county. In the 2022 midterm elections, no congressional districts flipped, though Republicans performed strongly in Orange County, with every statewide GOP candidate carrying it.

For the 118th United States Congress in the United States House of Representatives, Orange County is split between six congressional districts:
*,

According to the California Secretary of State, as of February 10, 2019, Orange County has 1,591,543 registered voters. Of these, 34% (541,711) are registered Republicans, and 33.3% (529,651) are registered Democrats. An additional 28.5% (453,343) declined to state a political party.

Orange County has produced notable Republicans, such as President Richard Nixon (born in Yorba Linda and lived in Fullerton and San Clemente), U.S. Senator John F. Seymour (previously mayor of Anaheim), and U.S. Senator Thomas Kuchel (of Anaheim). Former Congressman Christopher Cox (of Newport Beach), a White House counsel for President Reagan, is also a former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Orange County was also home to former Republican Congressman John G. Schmitz, a presidential candidate in 1972 from the ultra-conservative American Independent Party, John Birch Society member, and the father of Mary Kay Letourneau. In 1996, Curt Pringle (later mayor of Anaheim) became the first Republican Speaker of the California State Assembly in decades.

While the growth of the county&#x27;s Hispanic and Asian populations in recent decades has significantly influenced Orange County&#x27;s culture, its conservative reputation has remained largely intact. Partisan voter registration patterns of Hispanics, Asians and other ethnic minorities in the county have tended to reflect the surrounding demographics, with resultant Republican majorities in all but the central portion of the county. When Loretta Sanchez, a Blue Dog Democrat, defeated veteran Republican Bob Dornan in 1996, she was continuing a trend of Democratic representation of that district that had been interrupted by Dornan&#x27;s 1984 upset of former Congressman Jerry Patterson. Until 1992, Sanchez herself was a moderate Republican, and she is viewed as somewhat more moderate than other Democrats from Southern California.

In 2004, George W. Bush captured 60% of the county&#x27;s vote, up from 56% in 2000 despite a higher Democratic popular vote statewide. Although Barbara Boxer won statewide in the simultaneously held senate election and fared better in Orange County than she did in 1998, Republican Bill Jones defeated her in the county, 51% to 43%. While the 39% that John Kerry received is higher than the percentage Bill Clinton won in 1992 or 1996, the percentage of the vote George W. Bush received in 2004 is the highest any presidential candidate has received since 1988, showing a still-dominant GOP presence in the county. In 2006, Senator Dianne Feinstein won 45% of the vote in the county, the best showing of a Democrat in a Senate race in over four decades, but Orange was nevertheless the only Coastal California county to vote for her Republican opponent, Dick Mountjoy.

The county is featured prominently in Lisa McGirr&#x27;s book &quot;Suburban Warriors: The Origins of the New American Right&quot;. She argues that its conservative political orientation in the 20th century owed much to its settlement by farmers from the Great Plains, who reacted strongly to communist sympathies, the civil rights movement, and the turmoil of the 1960s in nearby Los Angeles — across the &quot;Orange Curtain&quot;.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Orange County was one of California&#x27;s leading Republican voting blocs and a subculture of residents with &quot;Middle American&quot; values that emphasized capitalist religious morality in contrast to West coast liberalism.

Orange County has many Republican voters from culturally conservative Asian-American, Middle Eastern and Latino immigrant groups. The large Vietnamese-American communities in Garden Grove and Westminster are predominantly Republican; Vietnamese Americans registered Republicans outnumber those registered as Democrats, 55% to 22% as of 2007, while as of 2017 that figure is 42% to 36%. Republican Assemblyman Van Tran was the first Vietnamese-American elected to a state legislature and joined with Texan Hubert Vo as the highest-ranking elected Vietnamese-American in the United States until the 2008 election of Joseph Cao in Louisiana&#x27;s 2nd congressional district. In the 2007 special election for the vacant county supervisor seat following Democrat Lou Correa&#x27;s election to the state senate, two Vietnamese-American Republican candidates topped the list of 10 candidates, separated from each other by only seven votes, making the Orange County Board of Supervisors entirely Republican; Correa is first of only two Democrats to have served on the Board since 1987 and only the fifth since 1963.

Even with the Democratic sweep of Orange County&#x27;s congressional seats in 2018, as well as a steady trend of Democratic gains in voter registration, the county remains very Republican downballot. Generally, larger cities–those with a population over 100,000, such as Anaheim, Santa Ana, and Irvine – feature a registration advantage for Democrats, while the other municipalities still have a Republican voter registration advantage. This is especially true in Newport Beach, Yorba Linda, and Villa Park, the three cities where the Republican advantage is largest. As of February 10, 2019, the only exceptions to the former are Huntington Beach and Orange, while exceptions to the latter include Buena Park, Laguna Beach and Stanton.

Similarly, despite Orange county supporting Democratic candidates for president in 2016, and 2020, there are still several smaller municipalities in the county that have continued to vote Republican for president. In addition to the aforementioned Newport Beach, Yorba Linda, and Villa Park, the cities of Huntington Beach, Dana Point, San Juan Capistrano, and San Clemente also supported Republican nominee Donald Trump for president twice.

==Media==
Orange County is served by media in Los Angeles, including its TV and radio stations. Two television stations—KOCE-TV, the main PBS member station in the Southland and KDOC-TV, a Tri-State Christian Television (TCT) owned-and-operated station—are located in Orange County.

There are a few radio stations that are actually located in Orange County. KYLA 92.7 FM has a Christian format. KSBR 88.5 FM airs a jazz music format branded as &quot;Jazz-FM&quot; along with news programming. KUCI 88.9 FM is a free form college radio station that broadcasts from UC Irvine. KWIZ 96.7 FM, located in Santa Ana, airs a regional Mexican music format branded as &quot;La Rockola 96.7&quot;. KWVE-FM 107.9 is owned by the Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa. KWVE-FM is also the primary Emergency Alert System station for the county. The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim also own and operate a sports-only radio station from Orange, KLAA. KX 93.5 FM broadcasts out of Laguna Beach and features an eclectic mix of mostly alternative rock.

County-wide politics and government coverage is primarily provided by the &quot;Orange County Register&quot; and &quot;Voice of OC&quot;. &quot;OC Weekly&quot; was an alternative weekly publication, and &quot;Excélsior&quot; is a Spanish-language newspaper. A few communities are served by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″ publication of the &quot;Daily Pilot&quot;. &quot;Orange Coast&quot; was established in 1974 and is the oldest continuously published lifestyle magazine in the region. &quot;OC Music Magazine&quot; is also based out of Orange County, serving local musicians and artists.
The &quot;Orange County Plain Dealer&quot; (January 1898 to May 8, 1925), was a mostly Anaheim-based newspaper, and successor to &quot;The Independent&quot;, bought by James E. Valjean, a Republican and edited by him, a former editor of the Portsmouth Blade (Ohio).

Other newspapers were: &quot;Anaheim Daily Herald&quot;, &quot;Anaheim Gazette&quot;, &quot;Anaheim Bulletin&quot;.

==Transportation==
Transit in Orange County is offered primarily by the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA). OCTA manages the county&#x27;s bus network and funds the construction and maintenance of local streets, highways, and freeways; regulates taxicab services; maintains express toll lanes through the median of California State Route 91; and works with Southern California&#x27;s Metrolink to provide commuter rail service along three lines: the Orange County Line, the 91/Perris Valley Line, and the Inland Empire–Orange County Line, along with owning the land on which the Surf Line rests upon from the county line just north of Trestles Bridge until the wye adjacent to Fullerton Station.

===Major highways===

Ground transportation in Orange County relies heavily on three major interstate highways: the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5), the San Diego Freeway (I-405 and I-5 south of Irvine), and the San Gabriel River Freeway (I-605), which briefly passes through northwestern Orange County. The other freeways in the county are state highways, and include the Riverside and Artesia Freeway (SR 91) and the Garden Grove Freeway (SR 22) running east–west, and the Orange Freeway (SR 57), the Costa Mesa Freeway (SR 55), the Laguna Freeway (SR 133), the San Joaquin Transportation Corridor (SR 73), the Eastern Transportation Corridor (SR 261, SR 133, SR 241), and the Foothill Transportation Corridor (SR 241) running north–south. Minor stub freeways include the Richard M. Nixon Freeway (SR 90), also known as Imperial Highway, and the southern terminus of Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1). There are no U.S. Highways in Orange County, though two existed in the county until the mid-1960s: 91 and 101. US 91 went through what is now the state route of the same number, and US 101 was replaced by Interstate 5. SR 1 was once a bypass of US 101 (Route 101A).

===Bus===
The bus network comprises 6,542 stops on 77 lines, running along most major streets, and accounts for 210,000 boardings a day. The fleet of 817 buses is gradually being replaced by CNG (Compressed natural gas)-powered vehicles, which already represent over 40% of the total fleet. Service is operated by OCTA employees and First Transit under contract. OCTA operates one bus rapid transit service, Bravo, on Harbor Boulevard. In addition, OCTA offers paratransit service for the disabled (OC ACCESS), also operated by MV.

===Rail===
Since 1992, Metrolink has operated three commuter rail lines through Orange County, and has also maintained Rail-to-Rail service with parallel Amtrak service. On a typical weekday, over 40 trains run along the Orange County Line, the 91/Perris Valley Line and the Inland Empire–Orange County Line. Along with Metrolink riders on parallel Amtrak lines, these lines generate approximately 15,000 boardings per weekday. Metrolink also began offering weekend service on the Orange County Line and the Inland Empire-Orange County line in the summer of 2006. As ridership has steadily increased in the region, new stations have opened at Anaheim Canyon, Buena Park, Tustin, and Laguna Niguel/Mission Viejo. Plans for a future station in Placentia are underway and is expected to be completed by 2020.

Since 1938, the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad and later Amtrak, has operated the &quot;Pacific Surfliner&quot; regional passenger train route (previously named the &quot;San Diegan&quot; until 2000) through Orange County. The route includes stops at eight stations in Orange County including, in northbound order, San Clemente Pier (selected trips), San Juan Capistrano, Laguna Niguel/Mission Viejo (formerly), Irvine Transportation Center, Santa Ana Regional Transportation Center, Orange Transportation Center (formerly), Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center (ARTIC), and Fullerton Transportation Center.

OC Streetcar, formerly known as the Santa Ana/Garden Grove Fixed Guideway Project, is a streetcar line connecting Downtown Santa Ana to the Depot at Santa Ana which is currently under construction and expected to open in 2023. OCTA has also proposed connecting the two systems via Harbor Boulevard and the West Santa Ana Branch corridor. Plans for a streetcar for Harbor Boulevard in Fullerton, Anaheim, and Garden Grove — the Anaheim Rapid Connection — were shelved in 2018.

===Sea===
A car and passenger ferry service, the Balboa Island Ferry, comprising three ferries running every five minutes, operates within Newport Harbor between Balboa Peninsula and Balboa Island in Newport Beach. The Catalina Flyer connects the Balboa Peninsula to Avalon with daily round-trip passage through about nine months of the year. The Catalina Express connects Dana Point to Avalon (with departures from two greater Long Beach ports also connecting to Two Harbors).

===Air===
Orange County&#x27;s only major airport is John Wayne Airport; its abbreviation (SNA) refers to Santa Ana, the closest large town in the early 20th century. The airport is located in unincorporated territory surrounded by Newport Beach, Costa Mesa, and Irvine. On destination monitors with flights to SNA, the airport is usually described as &quot;Orange County, CA&quot; or &quot;Santa Ana/Orange County&quot;. In 2014, its Thomas F. Riley Terminal handled over 9 million passengers annually and as of 2019, seven airline brands provide scheduled service.

===Unincorporated communities===
These communities are outside city limits in unincorporated county territory.
===Planned communities===
Orange County has a history of large planned communities. Nearly 30 percent of the county was created as master planned communities, the most notable being the City of Irvine, Coto de Caza, Anaheim Hills, Tustin Ranch, Tustin Legacy, Ladera Ranch, Talega, Rancho Santa Margarita, and Mission Viejo. Irvine is often referred to as a model master-planned city because its original seven villages (College Park, The Colony, The Ranch, Culverdale, The Racket Club, University Park, and Turtle Rock) were laid out by the Irvine Company of the mid-1960s before it was bought by a group of investors including Donald Bren.

==In culture==
Orange County has been the setting for numerous written works and motion pictures, as well as a popular location for shooting motion pictures.

The city of San Juan Capistrano is where writer Johnston McCulley set the first novella about Zorro, &quot;The Curse of Capistrano&quot;. It was published in 1919 and later renamed &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot;. Science fiction novels set in Orange County include &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; (1977) by Philip K. Dick and the &quot;Three Californias&quot; trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson (1984–1990). Many novels by suspense thriller writer Dean Koontz are set in Orange County; Koontz is a resident of Newport Beach.

Orange County was featured by Huell Howser in &quot;Road Trip&quot; Episode 109.

Popular television series set in Orange County include the Fox drama &quot;The O.C.&quot; (2003–2007), the Fox sitcom &quot;Arrested Development&quot; (2003–2006), and the Bravo reality show &quot;The Real Housewives of Orange County&quot; (2006–present). The three programs share a common focus on the extravagant lifestyles of the county&#x27;s upper class.

<doc id="45332" wikidata="Q648404" url="?curid=45332" title="Gresham's law">
<text>In economics, Gresham&#x27;s law is a monetary principle stating that &quot;bad money drives out good&quot;. For example, if there are two forms of commodity money in circulation, which are accepted by law as having similar face value, the more valuable commodity will gradually disappear from circulation.

The law was named in 1857 by economist Henry Dunning Macleod after Sir Thomas Gresham (1519–1579), an English financier during the Tudor dynasty. Gresham had urged Queen Elizabeth to restore confidence in then-debased English currency.

The concept was thoroughly defined in Renaissance Europe by Nicolaus Copernicus and known centuries earlier in classical Antiquity, the Near East, and China.

== &quot;Good money&quot; and &quot;bad money&quot; ==
Under Gresham&#x27;s law, &quot;good money&quot; is money that shows little difference between its nominal value (the face value of the coin) and its commodity value (the value of the metal of which it is made, often precious metals, such as gold or silver).

The price spread between face value and commodity value when it is minted is called seigniorage. As some coins do not circulate, remaining in the possession of coin collectors, this can increase demand for coinage.

On the other hand, &quot;bad money&quot; is money that has a commodity value considerably lower than its face value and is in circulation along with good money, where both forms are required to be accepted at equal value as legal tender.

In Gresham&#x27;s day, bad money included any coin that had been debased. Debasement was often done by the issuing body, where less than the officially specified amount of precious metal was contained in an issue of coinage, usually by alloying it with a base metal. The public could also debase coins, usually by clipping or scraping off small portions of the precious metal, also known as &quot;stemming&quot; (reeded edges on coins were intended to make clipping evident). Other examples of bad money include counterfeit coins made from base metal. Today virtually all circulating coins are made from base metals, often the cheapest available, durable base metal; collectively these monies are known as fiat money. While virtually all contemporary coinage is composed solely of base metals, there have been periods during the 21st century in which the market value of some base metals, like copper, have been high enough that at least one common coin (the U.S. nickel) still maintained &quot;good money&quot; status.

In the case of clipped, scraped, or counterfeit coins, the commodity value was reduced by fraud. The face value remains at the previous higher level. On the other hand, with a coinage debased by a government issuer, the commodity value of the coinage was often reduced quite openly, while the face value of the debased coins was held at the higher level by legal tender laws.

The old saying, &quot;a bad penny always turns up&quot; is a colloquial recognition of Gresham&#x27;s law.

== Theory ==
The law states that any circulating currency consisting of both &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; money (both forms required to be accepted at equal value under legal tender law) quickly becomes dominated by the &quot;bad&quot; money. This is because people spending money will hand over the &quot;bad&quot; coins rather than the &quot;good&quot; ones, keeping the &quot;good&quot; ones for themselves. Legal tender laws act as a form of price control. In such a case, the intrinsically less valuable money is preferred in exchange, because people prefer to save the intrinsically more valuable money.

Imagine that a customer with several silver sixpence coins purchases an item which costs five pence. Some of the customer&#x27;s coins are more debased, while others are less so – but legally, they are all mandated to be of equal value. The customer would prefer to retain the better coins, and so offers the shopkeeper the most debased one. In turn, the shopkeeper must give one penny in change, and has every reason to give the most debased penny. Thus, the coins that circulate in the transaction will tend to be of the most debased sort available to the parties.

If &quot;good&quot; coins have a face value below that of their metallic content, individuals may be motivated to melt them down and sell the metal for its higher intrinsic value, even if such destruction is illegal. The 1965 United States half-dollar coins contained 40% silver; in previous years these coins were 90% silver (.900, or &quot;one nine fine&quot;). With the release of the 1965 half-dollar, which was legally required to be accepted at the same value as the earlier 90% halves, the older 90% silver coinage quickly disappeared from circulation, while the newer debased coins remained in use. As the value of the dollar (Federal Reserve notes) continued to decline, resulting in the value of the silver content exceeding the face value of the coins, many of the older half dollars were melted down or removed from circulation and into private collections and hoards. Beginning in 1971, the U.S. government abandoned including any silver in half dollars. The metal value of the 40% silver coins began to exceed their face value, which resulted in a repeat of the previous event. The 40% silver coins also began to vanish from circulation and into coin hoards.

A similar situation occurred in 2007 in the United States with the rising price of copper, zinc, and nickel, which led the U.S. government to ban the melting or mass exportation of one-cent and five-cent coins.

In addition to being melted down for its bullion value, money that is considered to be &quot;good&quot; tends to leave an economy through international trade. International traders are not bound by legal tender laws as citizens of the issuing country are, so they will offer higher value for good coins than bad ones. The good coins may leave their country of origin to become part of international trade, escaping that country&#x27;s legal tender laws and leaving the &quot;bad&quot; money behind. This occurred in Britain during the period of adoption of the gold standard: In 1717 Isaac Newton, then Master of the Mint, declared the gold guinea to be worth 21 silver shillings. This overvalued the gold guinea in Britain, making it &quot;bad&quot;, and encouraged people to send &quot;good&quot; silver shillings abroad, where it could buy more gold than at home. This gold was then minted as currency, which bought silver shillings, which were sent abroad for gold, and so on. For a century hardly any silver coins were minted in Britain, and Britain moved onto a &quot;de facto&quot; gold standard.

Austrian economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe said that &quot;so-called Gresham&#x27;s law&quot; only applies under certain conditions, largely a result of governmental interventionist policies. In his 2021 book, &quot;Economy, Society, and History&quot; Hoppe states:You might have heard about the so-called Gresham&#x27;s law, which states that bad money drives out good money, but this law only holds if there are price controls in effect, only if the exchange ratios of different monies are fixed and no longer reflect market forces. Is it the case that bad money drives out good money under normal circumstances without any interference? No, for money holds to exactly the same law that holds for every other good. Good goods drive out bad goods. Good money drives out bad money, so this bezant was for something like 800 years considered to be the best money available and was preferred by merchants from India to Rome to the Baltic Sea.

== History of the concept ==
Gresham was not the first to state the law which took his name. The phenomenon had been noted by Aristophanes in his play &quot;The Frogs&quot;, which dates from around the end of the 5th century BC. The referenced passage from &quot;The Frogs&quot; is as follows (usually dated at 405 BC):

According to Ben Tamari, the currency devaluation phenomenon was already recognized in ancient sources. He brings some examples which include the Machpela Cave transaction and the building of the Temple from the Bible and the Mishna in tractate Bava Metzia () from the Talmud.

In China, Yuan dynasty economic authors Yeh Shih and Yuan Hsieh (c. 1223) were aware of the same phenomenon.

Ibn Taimiyyah (1263–1328) described the phenomenon as follows:

Notably this passage mentions only the flight of good money abroad and says nothing of its disappearance due to hoarding or melting. Palestinian economist Adel Zagha also attributes a similar concept to medieval Islamic thinker Al-Maqrizi, who offered, claims Zagha, a close approximation to what would become known as Gresham&#x27;s law centuries later.

In the 14th century it was noted by Nicole Oresme , in his treatise &quot;On the Origin, Nature, Law, and Alterations of Money&quot;, and by jurist and historian Al-Maqrizi (1364–1442) in the Mamluk Empire.

Johannes de Strigys, an agent of Ludovico III Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua in Venice, wrote in a June 1472 report (&quot;that the bad money will chase out the good&quot;).

In the year that Gresham was born, 1519, it was described by Nicolaus Copernicus in a treatise called : &quot;bad (debased) coinage drives good (un-debased) coinage out of circulation&quot;. Copernicus was aware of the practice of exchanging bad coins for good ones and melting down the latter or sending them abroad, and he seems to have drawn up some notes on this subject while he was at Olsztyn in 1519. He made them the basis of a report which he presented to the Prussian Diet held in 1522, attending the session with his friend Tiedemann Giese to represent his chapter. Copernicus&#x27;s was an enlarged, Latin version of that report, setting forth a general theory of money for the 1528 diet. He also formulated a version of the quantity theory of money. For this reason, it is occasionally known as the Gresham–Copernicus law.

Sir Thomas Gresham, a 16th century financial agent of the English Crown in the city of Antwerp, was one in a long series of proponents of the law, which he did to explain to Queen Elizabeth I what was happening to the English shilling. Her father, Henry VIII, had replaced 40% of the silver in the coin with base metals, to increase the government&#x27;s income without raising taxes. Astute English merchants and ordinary subjects saved the good shillings from pure silver and circulated the bad ones. Hence, the bad money would be used whenever possible, and the good coinage would be saved and disappear from circulation.

According to the economist George Selgin in his paper &quot;Gresham&#x27;s Law&quot;:

Gresham made his observations of good and bad money while in the service of Queen Elizabeth, with respect only to the observed poor quality of British coinage. Earlier monarchs, Henry VIII and Edward VI, had forced the people to accept debased coinage by means of legal tender laws. Gresham also made his comparison of good and bad money where the precious metal in the money was the same metal, but of different weight. He did not compare silver to gold, or gold to paper.

In his &quot;Gresham&#x27;s Law&quot; article, Selgin also offers the following comments regarding the origin of the name:

==Reverse of Gresham&#x27;s law (Thiers&#x27; law)==

The experiences of dollarization in countries with weak economies and currencies (such as Israel in the 1980s, Eastern Europe and countries in the period immediately after the collapse of the Soviet bloc, or Ecuador throughout the late 20th and early 21st century) may be seen as Gresham&#x27;s law operating in its reverse form (Guidotti &amp; Rodriguez, 1992) because in general, the dollar has not been legal tender in such situations, and in some cases, its use has been illegal.

Adam Fergusson and Costantino Bresciani-Turroni (in his book , published in 1931) pointed out that, during the great inflation in the Weimar Republic in 1923, as the official money became so worthless that virtually nobody would take it, people simply stopped accepting the currency in exchange for goods. That was particularly serious because farmers began to hoard food. Accordingly, any currency backed by any sort of value became a circulating medium of exchange. In 2009, hyperinflation in Zimbabwe began to show similar characteristics.

Those examples show that in the absence of effective legal tender laws, Gresham&#x27;s law works in reverse. If given the choice of what money to accept, people will accept the money they believe to be of highest long-term value, and not accept what they believe to be of low long-term value. If not given the choice and required to accept all money, good and bad, they will tend to keep the money of greater perceived value in their own possession and pass the bad money to others.

In short, in the absence of legal tender laws, the seller will not accept anything but money of certain value (good money), but the existence of legal tender laws will cause the buyer to offer only money with the lowest commodity value (bad money), as the creditor must accept such money at face value.

Nobel Prize winner Robert Mundell believes that Gresham&#x27;s law could be more accurately rendered, taking care of the reverse, if it were expressed as: &quot;Bad money drives out good &quot;if they exchange for the same price&quot;.&quot;

The reverse of Gresham&#x27;s law, that good money drives out bad money whenever the bad money becomes nearly worthless, has been named &quot;Thiers&#x27; law&quot; by economist Peter Bernholz in honor of French politician and historian Adolphe Thiers. &quot;Thiers&#x27; Law will only operate later [in the inflation] when the increase of the new flexible exchange rate and of the rate of inflation lower the real demand for the inflating money.&quot;

==Analogs in other fields==
The principles of Gresham&#x27;s law can sometimes be applied to different fields of study. Gresham&#x27;s law may be generally applied to any circumstance in which the true value of something is markedly different from the value people are required to accept, due to factors such as lack of information or governmental decree.

Vice President Spiro Agnew used Gresham&#x27;s law in describing American news media, stating that &quot;Bad news drives out good news&quot;, although his argument was closer to that of a race to the bottom for higher ratings rather than over- and under-valuing certain kinds of news.

Gregory Bateson postulated an analogue to Gresham&#x27;s law operating in cultural evolution, in which &quot;the oversimplified ideas will always displace the sophisticated and the vulgar and hateful will always displace the beautiful. And yet the beautiful persists.&quot;

Cory Doctorow wrote that a similar effect to Gresham&#x27;s law occurred in carbon offset trading. The alleged information asymmetry is that people find it difficult to distinguish just how effective credits purchased are, but can easily tell the price. As a result, cheap credits that are ineffective can displace expensive but worthwhile carbon credits. The example given was The Nature Conservancy offering cheap, yet &quot;meaningless&quot;, carbon credits by purchasing cheap land unlikely to be logged anyway, rather than expensive and valuable land at risk of logging.

A corollary, Hughes&#x27; law, exists in moral philosophy, stating that, &quot;The evil acts of bad men elicit from better men acts which, under better circumstances, would also be called evil.&quot;

In the market for used cars, lemon automobiles (analogous to bad currency) will drive out the good cars. The problem is one of asymmetry of information. Sellers have a strong financial incentive to pass all used cars off as good cars, especially lemons. This makes it difficult to buy a good car at a fair price, as the buyer risks overpaying for a lemon. The result is that buyers will only pay the fair price of a lemon, so at least they reduce the risk of overpaying. High-quality cars tend to be pushed out of the market, because there is no good way to establish that they really are worth more. Certified pre-owned programs are an attempt to mitigate this problem by providing a warranty and other guarantees of quality. &quot;The Market for Lemons&quot; is a work that examines this problem in more detail.

<doc id="45333" wikidata="Q184313" url="?curid=45333" title="Magna Graecia">
<text>Magna Graecia is a term that was used for the Greek-speaking areas of Southern Italy, in the present-day Italian regions of Calabria, Apulia, Basilicata, Campania and Sicily; these regions were extensively populated by Greek settlers starting from the 8th century BC.

The settlements in this region, founded initially by their &quot;metropoleis&quot; (mother cities), eventually evolved into strong Greek city-states (&quot;poleis&quot;), functioning independently. The settlers brought with them their Hellenic civilization, and developed their own civilisation, due to the distance from the motherland and the influence of the indigenous peoples of southern Italy which left a lasting imprint on Italy (such as in the culture of ancient Rome). They also influenced the native peoples, such as the Sicels and the Oenotrians, who became hellenised after they adopted the Greek culture as their own. In some fields such as architecture and urban planning, they sometimes surpassed the mother country. The ancient inhabitants of Magna Graecia are called Italiotes and Siceliotes.

Remains of some of these Greek cities can be seen today, such as Neapolis (&quot;New City&quot;, now Naples), Syrakousai (Syracuse), Akragas (Agrigento), Taras (Taranto), Rhegion (Reggio Calabria), and Kroton (Crotone). The most populous city of Magna Graecia was Sybaris (now Sibari) with an estimated population, from 600 BC to 510 BC, between 300,000 and 500,000. 

The government of city-states was usually an aristocracy and the cities were often at war with each other. 

The Second Punic War put an end to the independence of the cities of Magna Graecia, which were annexed to the Roman Republic in 205BC.

From the motherland Greece, art, literature and philosophy decisively influenced the life of the colonies. In Magna Graecia much impetus was given to culture, especially in some cities such as Taras (now Taranto). Noteworthy was the South Italian ancient Greek pottery, fabricated in Magna Graecia largely during the 4th century BC. The settlers of Magna Graecia had great successes in the Ancient Olympic Games in their homeland. Crotone&#x27;s athletes won 18 titles in 25 Olympics. Although many of the Greek inhabitants of Magna Graecia were entirely Latinized during the Middle Ages, pockets of Greek culture and language remained and have survived to the present day. One example is the Griko people in Calabria (Bovesia) and Salento (Grecìa Salentina), some of whom still maintain their Greek language (Griko language) and customs. The Griko language is the last living trace of the Greek elements that once formed Magna Graecia.

==Terminology==

The original Greek expression &quot;Megálē Hellás&quot; (), later translated into Latin as , is attested for the first time in a passage from the 2nd century BC by the Greek historian Polybius (written around 150 BC), where he ascribed the term to Pythagoras and his philosophical school.

Ancient authors use &quot;Magna Graecia&quot; to mean different parts of southern Italy, including or excluding Sicily, Strabo and Livy being the most prominent advocates of the wider definitions. Strabo used the term to refer to the territory that had been conquered by the Greeks.

There are various hypotheses on the origin of the name &quot;Megálē Hellás&quot;. The term could be explained by the prosperity and cultural and economic splendour of the region (6th–5th century BC); notably by the Achaeans of the city of Kroton, to refer to the network of colonies they founded or controlled between the end of the 6th and mid-5th centuries at the time of the Pythagoreans.

==Context==
There were several reasons for the Greeks to establish overseas colonies; demographic crises (famine, overcrowding, etc.), &quot;stasis&quot;, a developing need for new commercial outlets and ports, and expulsion from their homeland after wars.

During the Archaic period, the Greek population grew beyond the capacity of the limited arable land of Greece proper, resulting in the large-scale establishment of colonies elsewhere: according to one estimate, the population of the widening area of Greek settlement increased roughly tenfold from 800 BC to 400 BC, from 800,000 to as many as -10 million. This was not simply for trade, but also to found settlements. These Greek colonies were not, as Roman colonies were, dependent on their mother-city, but were independent city-states in their own right.
Another reason was the strong economic growth with the consequent overpopulation of the motherland. The terrain that some of these Greek city-states were in could not support a large city. Politics was also the reason as refugees from Greek city-states tended to settle away from these cities in the colonies.

Greeks settled outside of Greece in two distinct ways. The first was in permanent settlements founded by the Greeks, which formed as independent poleis. The second form was in what historians refer to as &quot;emporia&quot;; trading posts which were occupied by both Greeks and non-Greeks and which were primarily concerned with the manufacture and sale of goods. Examples of this latter type of settlement are found at Al Mina in the east and Pithekoussai in the west.

From about 750 BC the Greeks began 250 years of expansion, settling colonies in all directions.

==History==


===Greek colonisation===

According to Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Geographica&quot;, the colonisation of Magna Graecia had already begun by the time of the Trojan War and lasted for several centuries.

Greeks began to settle in southern Italy in the 8th century BC. Their first great migratory wave was by the Euboeans aimed at the Gulf of Naples (Pithecusae, Cumae) and the Strait of Messina (Zancle, Rhegium). Pithecusae on the island of Ischia is considered the oldest Greek settlement in Italy, and Cumae their first colony on the mainland of Italy.

The second wave was of the Achaeans who concentrated initially on the Ionian coast (Metapontion, Poseidonia, Sybaris, Kroton), shortly before 720BC. At an unknown date between the 8th and 6th centuries BC the Athenians, of Ionian lineage, founded Scylletium (near today&#x27;s Catanzaro).

With colonisation, Greek culture was exported to Italy with its dialects of the Ancient Greek language, its religious rites, and its traditions of the independent &quot;polis&quot;. An original Hellenic civilization soon developed, and later interacted with the native Italic civilisations. The most important cultural transplant was the Chalcidean/Cumaean variety of the Greek alphabet, which was adopted by the Etruscans; the Old Italic alphabet subsequently evolved into the Latin alphabet, which became the most widely used alphabet in the world.

====Secondary colonisation====

Over time, due to overpopulation and other political and commercial reasons, the new cities expanded their presence in Italy by founding other Greek cities; effectively expanding the Greek civilisation to the whole territory known today as Magna Graecia.

Remains of some of these Greek colonies can be seen today such as those of Neapolis (&#x27;new city&#x27;, now Naples), Syracusae (Syracuse), Akragas (Agrigento), Taras (Taranto) and Rhegion (Reggio Calabria).

An intense colonisation program was undertaken by Syracuse, at the time of the tyranny of Dionysius I of Syracuse, around 387–385 BC. This phenomenon affected the entire Adriatic coast, and in particular led to the foundation in Italy of Ancon (now Ancona) and Adria; in the Dalmatian coast he saw the foundation of Issa (current Vis), Pharus (Stari Grad), Dimus (Hvar); Lissus (now Lezhë) was founded on the Albanian coast. Issa in turn then founded Tragurium (now Trogir), Corcyra Melaina (now Korčula) and Epetium (now Stobreč, a suburb of Split).

Rhegium (now Reggio Calabria) founded Pyxus (Policastro Bussentino) in Lucania; Locri founded Medma (Rosarno), Polyxena and Hipponium (Vibo Valentia) in present-day Calabria; Sybaris (now Sibari) revitalised the indigenous centres of Laüs and Scydrus in Calabria and founded Poseidonia (Paestum), in Campania; Kroton (now Crotone) founded Terina and participated in the foundation of Caulonia (near Monasterace marina) in Calabria; Messana (now Messina), in collaboration with Rhegium, founded Metaurus (Gioia Tauro); Taras together with Thurii founded Heracleia (Policoro) in Lucania in 434 BC, and also Callipolis (&#x27;beautiful city&#x27;).

===Expansion and conflict===
At the beginning of the 6th century BC, all the main cities of Magna Graecia on the Ionian Sea had achieved a high economic and cultural development, which shifted their interests towards expansion of their territory by waging war on neighbouring cities. The 6th century was therefore characterised by great clashes between the colonies. Some of the clashes that established the new balance and the new relationships of force were the Battle of the Sagra river (the clash between Locri Epizefiri and Kroton), the destruction of Siris (by Sybaris and Metapontum), and the clash between Kroton and Sybaris (which ended with the destruction of the latter).

As with all the events of this period precise dates are unknown, but the destruction of Sybaris may have occurred around 510 BC, while the two other clashes are placed around 580-560 BC, with the destruction of Siris before the Battle of the Sagra.

===Roman Era===


The first Greek city to be absorbed into the Roman Republic was Neàpolis in 327BC.

At the beginning of the 3rd century, Rome was a great power but had not yet entered into conflict with most of Magna Graecia, which had been allies of the Samnites. However, the needs of the Roman populace determined their need for territorial expansion towards the south. As the Greek cities of southern Italy came under threat from the Bruttii and Lucanians from the end of the 4th century BC, they asked for help from Rome, which exploited this opportunity by sending military garrisons in the 280s BC.

Following Rome&#x27;s victory over Taras after the Pyrrhic War in 272BC, most of the cities of southern Italy were linked to Rome with pacts and treaties (&quot;foedera&quot;) which sanctioned a sort of indirect control.

Sicily was conquered by Rome during the First Punic War. Only Syracuse remained independent until 212 because its king Hiero II was a devoted ally of the Romans. His grandson Hieronymus however allied with Hannibal, which prompted the Romans to besiege the city, which fell in 212BC.

After the second Punic War, Rome pursued an unprecedented program of reorganisation in the rest of Magna Graecia, where many of the cities were annexed to the Roman Republic in 205BC, as a consequence of their defection to Hannibal. Roman colonies (&quot;civium romanorum&quot;) were the main element of the new territorial control plan starting from the &quot;lex Atinia&quot; of 197BC. In 194BC, garrisons of 300 Roman veterans were implanted in Volturnum, Liternum, Puteoli, Salernum and Buxentum, and to Sipontum on the Adriatic. This model was replicated in the territory of the Brettii; 194BC saw the foundation of the Roman colonies of Kroton and Tempsa, followed by the Latin colonies of Copia (193BC) and Valentia (192BC).

The social, linguistic and administrative changes arising from the Roman conquest only took root in this region by the 1st century AD, while Greek culture remained strong and was actively cultivated as shown by epigraphic evidence.

===Middle Ages===
During the Early Middle Ages, following the disastrous Gothic War, new waves of Byzantine Christian Greeks fleeing the Slavic invasion of Peloponnese settled in Calabria, further strengthened the Hellenic element in the region. The iconoclast emperor Leo III appropriated lands that had been granted to the Papacy in southern Italy and the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire continued to govern the area in the form of the Catapanate of Italy (965 -1071) through the Middle Ages, well after northern Italy fell to the Lombards.

At the time of the Normans&#x27; late medieval conquest of southern Italy and Sicily (in the late 12th century), the Salento peninsula (the &quot;heel&quot; of Italy), up to one-third of Sicily (concentrated in the Val Demone), and much of Calabria and Lucania were still largely Greek-speaking. Some regions of southern Italy experienced demographic shifts as Greeks began to migrate northwards in significant numbers from regions further south; one such region was Cilento, which came to have a Greek-speaking majority. At this time the language had evolved into medieval Greek, also known as Byzantine Greek, and its speakers were known as Byzantine Greeks. The resultant fusion of local Byzantine Greek culture with Norman and Arab culture (from the Arab occupation of Sicily) gave rise to Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture in Sicily.

== List of Greek &quot;poleis&quot; ==
=== Mainland Italy===
This is a list of the 22 &quot;poleis&quot; (&quot;city-states&quot;) in Italy, according to Mogens Herman Hansen. It does not list all the Hellenic settlements, only those organised around a &quot;polis&quot; structure.
=== Sicily ===
This is a list of the 46 &quot;poleis&quot; (&quot;city-states&quot;) in Sicily, according to Mogens Herman Hansen. It does not list all the Hellenic settlements, only those organised around a &quot;polis&quot; structure.
=== Not part of Magna Graecia ===
==Administration==
The administrative organisation of Magna Graecia was inherited from the Hellenic poleis, taking up the concept of &quot;city-states&quot; administered by the aristocracy. The cities of Magna Graecia were independent like the Greek &quot;poleis&quot; of the motherland, and had an army and a military fleet. There were also cases of tyranny as in Syracuse, governed by the tyrant Dionysius, who fought the Carthaginians until his death.

==Economy==
In the cities of Magna Graecia, trade, agriculture and crafts developed. Initially oriented to the indigenous Italic populations, the trade was immediately an excellent channel of exchange with the Greeks of the motherland, even if today it is difficult to establish precisely the type of goods traded and the volume of these exchanges.

==Coinage==

Greek coinage of Italy and Sicily originated from local Italiotes and Siceliotes who formed numerous city-states. These Hellenistic communities descended from Greek migrants. Southern Italy was so thoroughly Hellenized that it was known as the Magna Graecia. Each of the polities struck their own coinage.

Taras (or Tarentum) was among the most prominent city-states.

By the second century BC, some of these Greek coinages evolved under Roman rule, and can be classified as the first Roman provincial currencies.

==Culture==
The Greek colonists of Magna Graecia elaborated a civilization, which had peculiar characteristics, due to the distance from the motherland and the influence of the indigenous peoples of southern Italy. From the motherland Greece, art, literature and philosophy decisively influenced the life of the colonies. In Magna Graecia much impetus was given to culture, especially in some cities, such as Taras (now Taranto). Pythagoras moved to Crotone where he founded his school in 530 BC. Among others, Aeschylus, Herodotus, Xenophanes and Plato visited Magna Graecia.

Among the illustrious characters born in Magna Graecia are the philosophers Parmenides of Elea, Zeno of Elea, Gorgias of Lentini and Empedocles of Agrigento; the Pythagoreans Philolaus of Crotone, Archytas of Taranto, Lysis of Taranto, Echecrates and Timaeus of Locri; the mathematician Archimedes of Syracuse; the poets Theocritus of Syracuse, Stesichorus, Ibycus of Reggio Calabria, Nossis of Locri, Alexis of Thuri and Leonidas of Taranto; the doctors Alcmeon of Crotone and Democedes of Crotone; the sculptor from Reggio Clearchus; the painter Zeuxis, the musicologist Aristoxenus of Taranto and the legislator Zaleucus of Locri.

===Language===

A remnant of Greek influence can be found in the survival of the Greek language in some villages of the above-mentioned Salento peninsula (the &quot;heel&quot; of Italy). This living dialect of Greek, known locally as Griko, is found in the Italian regions of Calabria and Apulia. &quot;Griko&quot; is considered by linguists to be a descendant of Byzantine Greek, which had been the majority language of Salento through the Middle Ages, combining also some ancient Doric and local romance elements. There is a rich oral tradition and Griko folklore, limited now but once numerous, to around 30,000 people, most of them having abandoned their language in favour of Italian. Some scholars, such as Gerhard Rohlfs, argue that the origins of Griko may ultimately be traced to the colonies of Magna Graecia.

===Art and architecture===


Magna Graecia, in some fields such as architecture and urban planning, sometimes surpassed the mother country and the other Greek colonies. In Magna Graecia, as well as in the other Greek colonies, the Doric style enriched with showy decorations was adopted as the dominant architectural style. In Magna Graecia, in particular, a Doric style influenced by the Ionic one was also used, especially in Sicily in the Achaean colonies. In Magna Graecia, limestone was used as a building material due to the difficulty in finding other materials. The Doric style in Magna Graecia reached its apogee, surpassing that of the motherland and the other Greek colonies.

Regarding urban planning, the cities of Magna Graecia, as well as many cities of Greek colonies in other regions, were more orderly and rational in the distribution of spaces than those of the mother country, making the urban fabric more practical. The first examples of urbanistically more rational Greek cities belonged to Magna Graecia, in this case Taranto, Metapontum and Megara Hyblaea. Characteristic of this new urban concept, which later spread also in the motherland to Rhodes and Miletus, was a checkerboard road network.

In Magna Graecia painting and sculpture also reached a notable level of quality. In Magna Graecia there were examples of excellence in sculpture, coroplastics and bronzes. As for vase painting, many famous Athenian potters moved to Magna Graecia creating works influenced by the culture of the place, making their paintings peculiar and different from those of the motherland, giving rise to the South Italian ancient Greek pottery. Also noteworthy are the mosaics, the goldsmith&#x27;s art and wall painting.

Noteworthy sculptures from Magna Graecia are the Apollo of Gaza, the Apollo of Piombino, the Dancing Satyr of Mazara del Vallo, the Head of a Philosopher and the &quot;Riace bronzes&quot;, while notable vases from Magna Graecia are the Darius Vase and the Nestor&#x27;s Cup. Noteworthy temples of Magna Graecia are the Temple of Concordia, Agrigento, the Temple of Hera Lacinia, the Temple of Heracles, Agrigento, The Temple of Juno in Agrigento, the Temple of Olympian Zeus, Agrigento, the Temple of Apollo (Syracuse), the Temple of Athena (Syracuse), the Temple of Athena (Paestum), the Temple C (Selinus), the Temple E (Selinus), the Temple F (Selinus), the Temple of Juno Lacinia (Crotone), the Second Temple of Hera (Paestum), the Heraion at Foce del Sele, the Temple of Poseidon (Taranto), the Tavole Palatine and the Temple of Victory (Himera).

===Theatre===

The Sicilian Greek colonists in Magna Graecia, but also from Campania and Apulia, also brought theatrical art from their motherland. The Greek Theatre of Syracuse, the , the , the , the , the , the and the most famous Greek Theater of Taormina, amply demonstrate this.

Only fragments of original dramaturgical works are left, but the tragedies of the three great giants Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides and the comedies of Aristophanes are known.

Some famous playwrights in the Greek language came directly from Magna Graecia. Others, such as Aeschylus and Epicharmus, worked for a long time in Sicily. Epicharmus can be considered Syracusan in all respects, having worked all his life with the tyrants of Syracuse. His comedy preceded that of the more famous Aristophanes by staging the gods for the first time in comedy. While Aeschylus, after a long stay in the Sicilian colonies, died in Sicily in the colony of Gela in 456 BC. Epicarmus and Phormis, both of 6th century BC, are the basis, for Aristotle, of the invention of the Greek comedy, as he says in his book on &quot;Poetics&quot;:

Other native dramatic authors of Magna Graecia, in addition to the Syracusan Phormis mentioned, are Achaeus of Syracuse, Apollodorus of Gela, Philemon of Syracuse and his son Philemon the younger. From Calabria, precisely from the colony of Thurii, came the playwright Alexis. While Rhinthon, although Sicilian from Syracuse, worked almost exclusively for the colony of Taranto.

==Sport==
The colonies sent athletes of all disciplines to the Ancient Olympic Games which were periodically held at Olympia and Delphi in Greece.

The colonists of Magna Graecia were very fond of the Hellenic games where they could prove to the Greeks that they belonged to the same place of origin, their physical strength and skills in the games were also played by their ancestors dozens of generations earlier. And for this reason the greatest sovereigns demanded that teams be trained to be sent to Greece.

Sport was therefore a channel of communication with the Hellenic peninsula, a means by which the colonies of Magna Graecia showed themselves to the rest of the Hellenic world. The settlers of Magna Graecia had great success in sporting competitions in their homeland. Crotone&#x27;s athletes won 18 titles in 25 Olympics.

==Essential timeline==

* 8th century BC: the first historical colony of Magna Graecia was that of Pithekoussai (current island of Ischia) founded in the 8th century BC by settlers from Chalcis and Eretria in Euboea. Probably, the island settlement of Pithekoussai was only a commercial establishment where the Greeks dealt with other peoples, especially with the Phoenician merchants, even if the issue is controversial. 
* 720 BC: the first Greek colony in mainland Italy, Kyme, is founded.
* 7th–6th century BC: maximum splendor of Sibari.
* 6th century BC: maximum splendor of Crotone.
* 6th–3rd century BC: minting of coins by the cities of Magna Graecia.
* 6th–5th century BC: maximum splendour of Magna Graecia due to the Pythagorean reforms and institutions.
* 510 BC: Sibari was defeated by Crotone whose troops were commanded by the famous athlete Milo of Croton. The city of Sibari was destroyed and its population was condemned to exile.
* 5th century BC: maximum splendor of Syracuse.
* 480 BC: Gelon, tyrant of Syracuse, defeated the troops of Carthage at Himera, in the north of Sicily.
* 474 BC: The fleet led by Hiero I, tyrant of Syracuse, assisted Kyme threatened by the Etruscans. This victory marked the end of the Etruscan extension in Campania.
* 459–454 BC: after an internal civil war in Crotone, the cities of Magna Graecia once linked to it, dissolve the bond of subjection.
* 444–443 BC: foundation of Thourioi. An Athenian expedition, officially Panhellenic because it was made up of Greeks from the islands of the Aegean Sea, founded the city of Thourioi. In reality, the cities of the Aegean Sea were part of the Delian League, a military league under the rule of Athens. The city of Thourioi hosted important people such as Herodotus, Protagoras, Hippodamus of Miletus and Lysias.
* 415–413 BC: The Sicilian Expedition occurred. It was an Athenian military expedition to Sicily, which took place from 415 to 413 BC, during the Peloponnesian War, between Athens on one side and Sparta, Syracuse and Corinth on the other. The expedition ended in a devastating defeat for the Athenian forces, severely impacting Athens. After the first Athenian victories, which put the Syracusan army in serious difficulty, the tide of the war was turned upside-down due to the Spartan reinforcements under the command of Gylippus. The defeat of the Athenian army led to the imprisonment of its soldiers in the Syracusan latomies, where they were forced to live in hardship and suffering until their death; few were the survivors who managed to return to their homeland. The failure of the expedition marked the beginning of the military and political decline of Athens, followed by the aristocratic coup d&#x27;état of 411 BC; it also marked Athens&#x27; definitive defeat in the Peloponnesian War (404 BC). Thucydides, an Athenian historian, dedicates two books of his work &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot; to the Athenian expedition, to underline the magnitude and exceptionality of the event. Thus he began &quot;a new work, a work on Sicily&quot; which became the background of the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC). The &quot;Parallel Lives&quot; of Plutarch (in particular the &quot;Life of Nicias&quot;) and the &quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot; of Diodorus Siculus are other important sources on the expedition to Sicily.
* 400 BC: the cities of Magna Graecia overlooking the Tyrrhenian Sea begin at the hands of the Italic peoples.
* 4th century BC: the cultural decline of the cities of Magna Graecia begins.
* 387 BC: Reggio is destroyed by Syracuse.
* 303 BC: peace between Taranto and Lucanians, who had attempted to conquer the city.
* 285 BC: Roman garrisons settle in Thourioi.
* 282–272 BC: Taranto was conquered by the Romans despite the intervention of Pyrrhus (Pyrrhic War in Italy).
* 264–241 BC: First Punic War, Rome takes control of Sicily, with the exception of Syracuse, which becomes Rome&#x27;s ally.
* 215–205 BC: during the Second Punic War Syracuse and then Taranto sided with Carthage. The two cities were conquered by the Romans in 211 after a three-year siege. These events put an end to the independence of all the cities of Magna Graecia, which were annexed to the Roman Republic in 205 BC.

==Modern and contemporary Italy==
Greek nobles started taking refuge in Italy following the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. Greeks immigrated once again to the region in the 16th and 17th centuries in reaction to the conquest of the Peloponnese by the Ottoman Empire. Especially after the end of the Siege of Coron (1534), large numbers of Greeks took refuge in the areas of Calabria, Salento and Sicily. Greeks from Coroni, the so-called Coronians, were nobles, who brought with them substantial movable property.

Other Greeks who moved to Italy came from the Mani Peninsula of the Peloponnese. The Maniots (their name originating from the Greek word &quot;mania&quot;) were known for their proud military traditions and for their bloody vendettas, many of which continue today. Another group of Maniot Greeks moved to Corsica in the 17th century under the protection of the Republic of Genoa.

Although many of the Greek inhabitants of Magna Graecia were entirely Latinized during the Middle Ages, pockets of Greek culture and language remained and have survived to the present day. One example is the Griko people in Calabria (Bovesia) and Salento (Grecìa Salentina), some of whom still maintain their Greek language (Griko language) and customs. The Griko language is the last living trace of the Greek elements that once formed Magna Graecia. Their working practices have been passed down through generations through storytelling and allowing the observation of work. The Italian parliament recognizes the Griko people as an ethnolinguistic minority under the official name of &quot;Minoranze linguistiche Grike dell&#x27;Etnia Griko-Calabrese e Salentina&quot;.

Messina in Sicily is home to a small Greek-speaking minority, which arrived from the Peloponnese between 1533 and 1534 when fleeing the expansion of the Ottoman Empire. They were officially recognised in 2012.

==UNESCO World Heritage Sites related to Magna Graecia==
===Valle dei Templi===


The Valle dei Templi, or Valley of the Temples, is an archaeological site in Agrigento (ancient Greek &quot;Akragas&quot;), Sicily. It is one of the most outstanding examples of ancient Greek art and architecture of Magna Graecia. The term &quot;valley&quot; is a misnomer, the site is located on a ridge outside the town of Agrigento.

Since 1997, the entire area has been included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. The archaeological and landscape park of the Valle dei Templi, with its 1,300 hectares, is the largest archaeological park in Europe and the Mediterranean basin.

The Valley includes remains of seven temples, all in Doric style. The ascription of the names, apart from that of the &quot;Olympeion&quot;, is a mere tradition established in Renaissance times. The temples are:

*Temple of Concordia, whose name comes from a Latin inscription found nearby, and which was built in the 5th century BC. Turned into a church in the 6th century AD, it is now one of the best preserved in the Valley.
*Temple of Juno, also built in the 5th century BC. It was burnt in 406 BC by the Carthaginians.
*Temple of Heracles, who was one of the most venerated deities in the ancient &quot;Akragas&quot;. It is the most ancient in the Valley: destroyed by an earthquake, it consists today of only eight columns.
*Temple of Olympian Zeus, built in 480 BC to celebrate the city-state&#x27;s victory over Carthage. It is characterized by the use of large-scale atlases.
*Temple of Castor and Pollux. Despite its remains including only four columns, it is now the symbol of modern Agrigento.
*Temple of Hephaestus (Vulcan), also dating from the 5th century BC. It is thought to have been one of the most imposing constructions in the valley; it is now however one of the most eroded.
*Temple of Asclepius, located far from the ancient town&#x27;s walls; it was the goal of pilgrims seeking cures for illness.

The Valley is also home to the so-called Tomb of Theron, a large tuff monument of pyramidal shape; scholars suppose it was built to commemorate the Romans killed in the Second Punic War.

===Poseidonia and Elea===

Cilento, Vallo di Diano and Alburni National Park (Italian &quot;Parco Nazionale del Cilento, Vallo di Diano e Alburni&quot;) is an Italian national park in the Province of Salerno, in Campania in southern Italy. It includes much of the Cilento, the Vallo di Diano and the Monti Alburni. It was founded in 1991, and was formerly known as the Parco Nazionale del Cilento e Vallo di Diano. In 1998 it became a World Heritage Site of UNESCO, along with the ancient Greek towns of Poseidonia, Elea and the Padula Charterhouse.

Much of the most celebrated features of the Poseidonia site today are the three large temples in the Archaic version of the Greek Doric order, dating from about 550 to 450 BC. All are typical of the period, with massive colonnades having a very pronounced entasis (widening as they go down), and very wide capitals resembling upturned mushrooms. Above the columns, only the second Temple of Hera retains most of its entablature, the other two having only the architrave in place. These were dedicated to Hera and Athena (Juno and Minerva to the Romans), although previously they often have been identified otherwise, following eighteenth-century arguments. The two temples of Hera are right next to each other, while the Temple of Athena is on the other side of the town centre. There were other temples, both Greek and Roman, which are far less well preserved.

Remains of Elea walls, with traces of one gate and several towers, of a total length of over three miles, still exist, and belong to three different periods, in all of which the crystalline limestone of the locality is used. Bricks were also employed in later times; their form is peculiar to this place, each having two rectangular channels on one side, and being about 1.5 inches square, with a thickness of nearly 4 inches They all bear Greek brick-stamps. There are some remains of cisterns on the site, and, various other traces of buildings.

===Syracuse===

Syracuse was founded in 733 BC by Greek settlers from Corinth and Tenea, led by the &quot;oecist&quot; (colonizer) Archias. There are many attested variants of the name of the city including &quot;Syrakousai&quot;, &quot;Syrakosai&quot; and &quot;Syrakō&quot;. In the modern day, the city is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site along with the Necropolis of Pantalica.

The buildings of Syracuse from the Greek period are:
* The city walls
* The Temple of Apollo, at Piazza Emanuele Pancali, adapted to a church in Byzantine times and to a mosque under Arab rule.
* The Fountain of Arethusa, on Ortygia island. According to a legend, the nymph Arethusa, hunted by Alpheus, was turned into a spring by Artemis and appeared here.
* The Greek Theatre of Syracuse, whose cavea is one of the largest ever built by the ancient Greeks: it has 67 rows, divided into nine sections with eight aisles. Only traces of the scene and the orchestra remain. The edifice (still used today) was modified by the Romans, who adapted it to their different style of spectacles, including circus games. Near the theatre are the &quot;latomìe&quot;, stone quarries, also used as prisons in ancient times. The most famous &quot;latomìa&quot; is the &quot;Orecchio di Dionisio&quot; (&quot;Ear of Dionysius&quot;).
* The Tomb of Archimede, in the Grotticelli Necropolis. Decorated with two Doric columns.
* The Temple of Olympian Zeus, about outside the city, built around the 6th century BC.

<doc id="45336" wikidata="Q103308" url="?curid=45336" title="Pope Paschal I">
<text>Pope Paschal I (; died 824) was the bishop of Rome and ruler of the Papal States from 25 January 817 to his death in 824.

Paschal was a member of an aristocratic Roman family. Before his election to the papacy, he was abbot of St. Stephen&#x27;s monastery, which served pilgrims. In Rome in 823 he crowned Lothair I as Holy Roman Emperor. He rebuilt a number of churches in Rome, including three basilicas.

==Early life==
According to the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, Paschal was a native of Lazio Rome born Pascale Massimi and son of Bonosus and Episcopa Theodora. The &quot;Liber Censuum&quot; says that Paschal was from the Massimi branch of the Massimo family, as was his predecessor, Stephen IV.

Pope Leo III placed Paschal in charge of the monastery of St Stephen of the Abyssinians, where his responsibilities included the care of pilgrims visiting Rome. According to early modern accounts, Leo III may have elevated Paschal as the cardinal priest of Santa Prassede. Goodson attributes this account to a &quot;desire to explain the attention that the pope so lavishly and prominently paid to that church later in his career.&quot;

==Accession==
Paschal became pope on 25 January 817, just one day after the sudden death of Stephen IV. This decision was made without the sanction of Emperor Louis the Pious. Paschal began his pontificate apologizing for this slight, stressing that the office had been thrust upon him. He claimed that the decision had been made to avoid factional strife in Rome. According to the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, Pope Paschal&#x27;s legate Theodore returned with a document titled &quot;Pactum cum Paschali pontifice&quot;, in which the emperor congratulated Paschal, recognized his sovereignty over the Papal States, and guaranteed the free election of future pontiffs. This document has since been challenged by historians as a forgery.

==Papacy==

At first, Emperor Louis confirmed the agreement reached in Rheims with Paschal&#x27;s predecessor, Stephen IV, and detailed in the document &quot;Pactum Ludovicanum&quot; about free papal elections and noninterference in Church affairs unless officially asked for help. The two worked together to send Archbishop Ebbo of Rheims to evangelize the Danes in 822.

On Easter Sunday of 823, Paschal crowned and anointed Louis&#x27;s son Lothair I. Lothair was less amenable to cooperating with the Papal Curia than his father. He held a court and declared Farfa Abbey, just north of Rome, exempt from papal taxation. Paschal&#x27;s aristocratic opponents in the papal palace, especially his former legate, Theodore, and his son-in-law, Leo, who turned to the young leader of the Franks for support in their opposition to Paschal. The decision outraged the Roman nobility and led to an uprising against the authority of the Roman Curia in northern Italy led by Theodore and Leo. The revolt was quickly suppressed, and two of its leaders were seized, blinded, and afterwards beheaded by members of the papal household. Paschal denied any involvement, but the Emperor remained suspicious and sent two commissioners to investigate. Paschal refused to submit to the authority of the imperial court, but he did take an oath of purgation before a synod of thirty-four bishops. The commissioners returned to Aachen, and Emperor Louis let the matter drop.

===Construction projects===
Paschal gave shelter to exiled monks from the Byzantine Empire who had fled persecution for their opposition to iconoclasm. He both offered the exiled Byzantine mosaic artists work decorating churches in Rome and wrote to Louis the Pious and the Byzantine emperor Leo the Armenian in support of those who opposed iconoclasm.

Paschal rebuilt three basilicas of Rome: Santa Prassede, Santa Maria in Domnica, and Santa Cecilia in Trastevere. These churches contain mosaics with lifelike portraits of Paschal. Paschal is credited with finding the body of Saint Cecilia in the Catacomb of Callixtus and translating it to the rebuild the basilica of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere. Paschal also undertook significant renovations on Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. In addition, Paschal added two oratories to Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, SS. Processus et Martinianus and SS. Xistus et Fabianus, which did not survive the 16th century renovation of St. Peter&#x27;s.

Paschal is also sometimes credited with the renovation of Santo Stefano del Cacco in early modern sources, but this renovation was actually undertaken by Pope Paschal II.

According to Goodson, Paschal &quot;used church-building to express the authority of the papacy as an independent state.&quot;

===Writings===

Only six known letters written by Paschal remain. The first (Jaffé 2546) confirms the possessions of the Territorial Abbey of Farfa. The second and third (Jaffé 2547 and Jaffé 2548) were written to a Frankish abbot prior to and after his elevation as archbishop of Vienne. The fourth (Jaffé 2550) was written to Louis the Pious. The fifth (Jaffé 2551, preserved in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana) confirms the privileges of the church of Ravenna. The last (Jaffé 2553) was written to Ebbo, the archbishop of Reims.

==Death==
Paschal died on 11 February 824. The Roman Curia refused him the honour of burial within St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica because of his harsh government of the Roman people. He was instead buried in the Basilica of Santa Prassede, which also contains the famous &quot;Episcopa Theodora&quot; mosaic of his mother.

Paschal was canonized in the late sixteenth century. His feast day in the Roman calendar prior to 1963 was 14 May. It is currently celebrated on 11 February.

Pope and Patriarch of Rome (817–824), confessor is honored in Orthodox Church on 14 May.

<text>In game theory, the Nash equilibrium is the most commonly used solution concept for non-cooperative games. A Nash equilibrium is a situation where no player could gain by changing their own strategy (holding all other players&#x27; strategies fixed). The idea of Nash equilibrium dates back to the time of Cournot, who in 1838 applied it to his model of competition in an oligopoly.

If each player has chosen a strategy an action plan based on what has happened so far in the game and no one can increase one&#x27;s own expected payoff by changing one&#x27;s strategy while the other players keep theirs unchanged, then the current set of strategy choices constitutes a Nash equilibrium.

If two players Alice and Bob choose strategies A and B, (A, B) is a Nash equilibrium if Alice has no other strategy available that does better than A at maximizing her payoff in response to Bob choosing B, and Bob has no other strategy available that does better than B at maximizing his payoff in response to Alice choosing A. In a game in which Carol and Dan are also players, (A, B, C, D) is a Nash equilibrium if A is Alice&#x27;s best response to (B, C, D), B is Bob&#x27;s best response to (A, C, D), and so forth.

Nash showed that there is a Nash equilibrium, possibly in mixed strategies, for every finite game.

==Applications==
Game theorists use Nash equilibrium to analyze the outcome of the strategic interaction of several decision makers. In a strategic interaction, the outcome for each decision-maker depends on the decisions of the others as well as their own. The simple insight underlying Nash&#x27;s idea is that one cannot predict the choices of multiple decision makers if one analyzes those decisions in isolation. Instead, one must ask what each player would do taking into account what the player expects the others to do. Nash equilibrium requires that one&#x27;s choices be consistent: no players wish to undo their decision given what the others are deciding.

The concept has been used to analyze hostile situations such as wars and arms races (see prisoner&#x27;s dilemma), and also how conflict may be mitigated by repeated interaction (see tit-for-tat). It has also been used to study to what extent people with different preferences can cooperate (see battle of the sexes), and whether they will take risks to achieve a cooperative outcome (see stag hunt). It has been used to study the adoption of technical standards, and also the occurrence of bank runs and currency crises (see coordination game). Other applications include traffic flow (see Wardrop&#x27;s principle), how to organize auctions (see auction theory), the outcome of efforts exerted by multiple parties in the education process, regulatory legislation such as environmental regulations (see tragedy of the commons), natural resource management, analysing strategies in marketing, penalty kicks in football (I.e. soccer; see matching pennies), robot navigation in crowds, energy systems, transportation systems, evacuation problems and wireless communications.

==History==
Nash equilibrium is named after American mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr. The same idea was used in a particular application in 1838 by Antoine Augustin Cournot in his theory of oligopoly. In Cournot&#x27;s theory, each of several firms choose how much output to produce to maximize its profit. The best output for one firm depends on the outputs of the others. A Cournot equilibrium occurs when each firm&#x27;s output maximizes its profits given the output of the other firms, which is a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. Cournot also introduced the concept of best response dynamics in his analysis of the stability of equilibrium. Cournot did not use the idea in any other applications, however, or define it generally.

The modern concept of Nash equilibrium is instead defined in terms of mixed strategies, where players choose a probability distribution over possible pure strategies (which might put 100% of the probability on one pure strategy; such pure strategies are a subset of mixed strategies). The concept of a mixed-strategy equilibrium was introduced by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern in their 1944 book &quot;The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior&quot;, but their analysis was restricted to the special case of zero-sum games. They showed that a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium will exist for any zero-sum game with a finite set of actions. The contribution of Nash in his 1951 article &quot;Non-Cooperative Games&quot; was to define a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium for any game with a finite set of actions and prove that at least one (mixed-strategy) Nash equilibrium must exist in such a game. The key to Nash&#x27;s ability to prove existence far more generally than von Neumann lay in his definition of equilibrium. According to Nash, &quot;an equilibrium point is an n-tuple such that each player&#x27;s mixed strategy maximizes [their] payoff if the strategies of the others are held fixed. Thus each player&#x27;s strategy is optimal against those of the others.&quot; Putting the problem in this framework allowed Nash to employ the Kakutani fixed-point theorem in his 1950 paper to prove existence of equilibria. His 1951 paper used the simpler Brouwer fixed-point theorem for the same purpose.

Game theorists have discovered that in some circumstances Nash equilibrium makes invalid predictions or fails to make a unique prediction. They have proposed many solution concepts (&#x27;refinements&#x27; of Nash equilibria) designed to rule out implausible Nash equilibria. One particularly important issue is that some Nash equilibria may be based on threats that are not &#x27;credible&#x27;. In 1965 Reinhard Selten proposed subgame perfect equilibrium as a refinement that eliminates equilibria which depend on non-credible threats. Other extensions of the Nash equilibrium concept have addressed what happens if a game is repeated, or what happens if a game is played in the absence of complete information. However, subsequent refinements and extensions of Nash equilibrium share the main insight on which Nash&#x27;s concept rests: the equilibrium is a set of strategies such that each player&#x27;s strategy is optimal given the choices of the others.

==Definitions==

===Nash equilibrium===
A strategy profile is a set of strategies, one for each player. Informally, a strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium if no player can do better by unilaterally changing their strategy. To see what this means, imagine that each player is told the strategies of the others. Suppose then that each player asks themselves: &quot;Knowing the strategies of the other players, and treating the strategies of the other players as set in stone, can I benefit by changing my strategy?&quot;

For instance if a player prefers &quot;Yes&quot;, then that set of strategies is not a Nash equilibrium. But if every player prefers not to switch (or is indifferent between switching and not) then the strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium. Thus, each strategy in a Nash equilibrium is a best response to the other players&#x27; strategies in that equilibrium.

Formally, let formula_1 be the set of all possible strategies for player formula_2, where formula_3. Let formula_4 be a strategy profile, a set consisting of one strategy for each player, where formula_5 denotes the formula_6 strategies of all the players except formula_2. Let formula_8 be player &quot;i&quot;″s payoff as a function of the strategies. The strategy profile formula_9 is a Nash equilibrium if 
: formula_10

A game can have more than one Nash equilibrium. Even if the equilibrium is unique, it might be &quot;weak&quot;: a player might be indifferent among several strategies given the other players&#x27; choices. It is unique and called a &quot;strict Nash equilibrium&quot; if the inequality is strict so one strategy is the unique best response: 
: formula_11
The strategy set formula_1 can be different for different players, and its elements can be a variety of mathematical objects. Most simply, a player might choose between two strategies, e.g. formula_13 Or the strategy set might be a finite set of conditional strategies responding to other players, e.g. formula_14 Or it might be an infinite set, a continuum or unbounded, e.g. formula_15 such that formula_16 is a non-negative real number. Nash&#x27;s existing proofs assume a finite strategy set, but the concept of Nash equilibrium does not require it.

== Variants ==

=== Pure/mixed equilibrium ===
A game can have a pure-strategy or a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. In the latter, not every player always plays the same strategy. Instead, there is a probability distribution over different strategies.

=== Strict/non-strict equilibrium ===
Suppose that in the Nash equilibrium, each player asks themselves: &quot;Knowing the strategies of the other players, and treating the strategies of the other players as set in stone, would I suffer a loss by changing my strategy?&quot;

If every player&#x27;s answer is &quot;Yes&quot;, then the equilibrium is classified as a &quot;strict Nash equilibrium&quot;.

If instead, for some player, there is exact equality between the strategy in Nash equilibrium and some other strategy that gives exactly the same payout (i.e. the player is indifferent between switching and not), then the equilibrium is classified as a &quot;weak&quot; or &quot;non-strict Nash equilibrium&quot;.

=== Equilibria for coalitions ===
The Nash equilibrium defines stability only in terms of individual player deviations. In cooperative games such a concept is not convincing enough. Strong Nash equilibrium allows for deviations by every conceivable coalition. Formally, a strong Nash equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium in which no coalition, taking the actions of its complements as given, can cooperatively deviate in a way that benefits all of its members. However, the strong Nash concept is sometimes perceived as too &quot;strong&quot; in that the environment allows for unlimited private communication. In fact, strong Nash equilibrium has to be Pareto efficient. As a result of these requirements, strong Nash is too rare to be useful in many branches of game theory. However, in games such as elections with many more players than possible outcomes, it can be more common than a stable equilibrium.

A refined Nash equilibrium known as coalition-proof Nash equilibrium (CPNE) occurs when players cannot do better even if they are allowed to communicate and make &quot;self-enforcing&quot; agreement to deviate. Every correlated strategy supported by iterated strict dominance and on the Pareto frontier is a CPNE. Further, it is possible for a game to have a Nash equilibrium that is resilient against coalitions less than a specified size, k. CPNE is related to the theory of the core.

== Existence ==

===Nash&#x27;s existence theorem===
Nash proved that if mixed strategies (where a player chooses probabilities of using various pure strategies) are allowed, then every game with a finite number of players in which each player can choose from finitely many pure strategies has at least one Nash equilibrium, which might be a pure strategy for each player or might be a probability distribution over strategies for each player.

Nash equilibria need not exist if the set of choices is infinite and non-compact. For example:

* A game where two players simultaneously name a number and the player naming the larger number wins does not have a NE, as the set of choices is not compact because it is unbounded.
* Each of two players chooses a real number strictly less than 5 and the winner is whoever has the biggest number; no biggest number strictly less than 5 exists (if the number could equal 5, the Nash equilibrium would have both players choosing 5 and tying the game). Here, the set of choices is not compact because it is not closed.

However, a Nash equilibrium exists if the set of choices is compact with each player&#x27;s payoff continuous in the strategies of all the players.

=== Rosen&#x27;s existence theorem ===
Rosen extended Nash&#x27;s existence theorem in several ways. He considers an n-player game, in which the strategy of each player &quot;i&quot; is a vector &quot;si&quot; in the Euclidean space R&quot;mi&quot;. Denote &quot;m&quot;:=&quot;m&quot;1+...+&quot;mn&quot;; so a strategy-tuple is a vector in Rm. Part of the definition of a game is a subset &quot;S&quot; of Rm such that the strategy-tuple must be in &quot;S&quot;. This means that the actions of players may potentially be constrained based on actions of other players. A common special case of the model is when &quot;S&quot; is a Cartesian product of convex sets &quot;S&quot;1...,&quot;Sn&quot;, such that the strategy of player &quot;i&quot; must be in &quot;Si&quot;. This represents the case that the actions of each player &quot;i&quot; are constrained independently of other players&#x27; actions. If the following conditions hold:

* T is convex, closed and bounded;
* Each payoff function &quot;ui&quot; is continuous in the strategies of all players, and concave in &quot;si&quot; for every fixed value of &quot;s&quot;−&quot;i&quot;.

Then a Nash equilibrium exists. The proof uses the Kakutani fixed-point theorem. Rosen also proves that, under certain technical conditions which include strict concavity, the equilibrium is unique.

Nash&#x27;s result refers to the special case in which each &quot;Si&quot; is a simplex (representing all possible mixtures of pure strategies), and the payoff functions of all players are bilinear functions of the strategies.

== Rationality ==
The Nash equilibrium may sometimes appear non-rational in a third-person perspective. This is because a Nash equilibrium is not necessarily Pareto optimal.

Nash equilibrium may also have non-rational consequences in sequential games because players may &quot;threaten&quot; each other with threats they would not actually carry out. For such games the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium may be more meaningful as a tool of analysis.

== Examples ==

=== Coordination game ===


The &quot;coordination game&quot; is a classic two-player, two-strategy game, as shown in the example payoff matrix to the right. There are two pure-strategy equilibria, (A,A) with payoff 4 for each player and (B,B) with payoff 2 for each. The combination (B,B) is a Nash equilibrium because if either player unilaterally changes their strategy from B to A, their payoff will fall from 2 to 1.

A famous example of a coordination game is the stag hunt. Two players may choose to hunt a stag or a rabbit, the stag providing more meat (4 utility units, 2 for each player) than the rabbit (1 utility unit). The caveat is that the stag must be cooperatively hunted, so if one player attempts to hunt the stag, while the other hunts the rabbit, the stag hunter will totally fail, for a payoff of 0, whereas the rabbit hunter will succeed, for a payoff of 1. The game has two equilibria, (stag, stag) and (rabbit, rabbit), because a player&#x27;s optimal strategy depends on their expectation on what the other player will do. If one hunter trusts that the other will hunt the stag, they should hunt the stag; however if they think the other will hunt the rabbit, they too will hunt the rabbit. This game is used as an analogy for social cooperation, since much of the benefit that people gain in society depends upon people cooperating and implicitly trusting one another to act in a manner corresponding with cooperation.

Driving on a road against an oncoming car, and having to choose either to swerve on the left or to swerve on the right of the road, is also a coordination game. For example, with payoffs 10 meaning no crash and 0 meaning a crash, the coordination game can be defined with the following payoff matrix:
In this case there are two pure-strategy Nash equilibria, when both choose to either drive on the left or on the right. If we admit mixed strategies (where a pure strategy is chosen at random, subject to some fixed probability), then there are three Nash equilibria for the same case: two we have seen from the pure-strategy form, where the probabilities are (0%, 100%) for player one, (0%, 100%) for player two; and (100%, 0%) for player one, (100%, 0%) for player two respectively. We add another where the probabilities for each player are (50%, 50%).

=== Network traffic ===
An application of Nash equilibria is in determining the expected flow of traffic in a network. Consider the graph on the right. If we assume that there are formula_17 &quot;cars&quot; traveling from to , what is the expected distribution of traffic in the network?

This situation can be modeled as a &quot;game&quot;, where every traveler has a choice of 3 strategies and where each strategy is a route from to (one of , , or ). The &quot;payoff&quot; of each strategy is the travel time of each route. In the graph on the right, a car travelling via experiences travel time of formula_18, where formula_17 is the number of cars traveling on edge . Thus, payoffs for any given strategy depend on the choices of the other players, as is usual. However, the goal, in this case, is to minimize travel time, not maximize it. Equilibrium will occur when the time on all paths is exactly the same. When that happens, no single driver has any incentive to switch routes, since it can only add to their travel time. For the graph on the right, if, for example, 100 cars are travelling from to , then equilibrium will occur when 25 drivers travel via , 50 via , and 25 via . Every driver now has a total travel time of 3.75 (to see this, a total of 75 cars take the edge, and likewise, 75 cars take the edge).

Notice that this distribution is not, actually, socially optimal. If the 100 cars agreed that 50 travel via and the other 50 through , then travel time for any single car would actually be 3.5, which is less than 3.75. This is also the Nash equilibrium if the path between and is removed, which means that adding another possible route can decrease the efficiency of the system, a phenomenon known as Braess&#x27;s paradox.

=== Competition game ===
This can be illustrated by a two-player game in which both players simultaneously choose an integer from 0 to 3 and they both win the smaller of the two numbers in points. In addition, if one player chooses a larger number than the other, then they have to give up two points to the other.

This game has a unique pure-strategy Nash equilibrium: both players choosing 0 (highlighted in light red). Any other strategy can be improved by a player switching their number to one less than that of the other player. In the adjacent table, if the game begins at the green square, it is in player 1&#x27;s interest to move to the purple square and it is in player 2&#x27;s interest to move to the blue square. Although it would not fit the definition of a competition game, if the game is modified so that the two players win the named amount if they both choose the same number, and otherwise win nothing, then there are 4 Nash equilibria: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3).

=== Nash equilibria in a payoff matrix ===
There is an easy numerical way to identify Nash equilibria on a payoff matrix. It is especially helpful in two-person games where players have more than two strategies. In this case formal analysis may become too long. This rule does not apply to the case where mixed (stochastic) strategies are of interest. The rule goes as follows: if the first payoff number, in the payoff pair of the cell, is the maximum of the column of the cell and if the second number is the maximum of the row of the cell then the cell represents a Nash equilibrium.

We can apply this rule to a 3×3 matrix:
Using the rule, we can very quickly (much faster than with formal analysis) see that the Nash equilibria cells are (B,A), (A,B), and (C,C). Indeed, for cell (B,A), 40 is the maximum of the first column and 25 is the maximum of the second row. For (A,B), 25 is the maximum of the second column and 40 is the maximum of the first row; the same applies for cell (C,C). For other cells, either one or both of the duplet members are not the maximum of the corresponding rows and columns.

This said, the actual mechanics of finding equilibrium cells is obvious: find the maximum of a column and check if the second member of the pair is the maximum of the row. If these conditions are met, the cell represents a Nash equilibrium. Check all columns this way to find all NE cells. An N×N matrix may have between 0 and N×N pure-strategy Nash equilibria.

== Stability ==
The concept of stability, useful in the analysis of many kinds of equilibria, can also be applied to Nash equilibria.

A Nash equilibrium for a mixed-strategy game is stable if a small change (specifically, an infinitesimal change) in probabilities for one player leads to a situation where two conditions hold:

# the player who did not change has no better strategy in the new circumstance
# the player who did change is now playing with a strictly worse strategy.

If these cases are both met, then a player with the small change in their mixed strategy will return immediately to the Nash equilibrium. The equilibrium is said to be stable. If condition one does not hold then the equilibrium is unstable. If only condition one holds then there are likely to be an infinite number of optimal strategies for the player who changed.

In the &quot;driving game&quot; example above there are both stable and unstable equilibria. The equilibria involving mixed strategies with 100% probabilities are stable. If either player changes their probabilities slightly, they will be both at a disadvantage, and their opponent will have no reason to change their strategy in turn. The (50%,50%) equilibrium is unstable. If either player changes their probabilities (which would neither benefit or damage the expectation of the player who did the change, if the other player&#x27;s mixed strategy is still (50%,50%)), then the other player immediately has a better strategy at either (0%, 100%) or (100%, 0%).

Stability is crucial in practical applications of Nash equilibria, since the mixed strategy of each player is not perfectly known, but has to be inferred from statistical distribution of their actions in the game. In this case unstable equilibria are very unlikely to arise in practice, since any minute change in the proportions of each strategy seen will lead to a change in strategy and the breakdown of the equilibrium.

Finally in the eighties, building with great depth on such ideas Mertens-stable equilibria were introduced as a solution concept. Mertens stable equilibria satisfy both forward induction and backward induction. In a game theory context stable equilibria now usually refer to Mertens stable equilibria.

== Occurrence ==
If a game has a unique Nash equilibrium and is played among players under certain conditions, then the NE strategy set will be adopted. Sufficient conditions to guarantee that the Nash equilibrium is played are:
# The players all will do their utmost to maximize their expected payoff as described by the game.
# The players are flawless in execution.
# The players have sufficient intelligence to deduce the solution.
# The players know the planned equilibrium strategy of all of the other players.
# The players believe that a deviation in their own strategy will not cause deviations by any other players.
# There is common knowledge that all players meet these conditions, including this one. So, not only must each player know the other players meet the conditions, but also they must know that they all know that they meet them, and know that they know that they know that they meet them, and so on.

=== Where the conditions are not met ===
Examples of game theory problems in which these conditions are not met:
# The first condition is not met if the game does not correctly describe the quantities a player wishes to maximize. In this case there is no particular reason for that player to adopt an equilibrium strategy. For instance, the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma is not a dilemma if either player is happy to be jailed indefinitely.
# Intentional or accidental imperfection in execution. For example, a computer capable of flawless logical play facing a second flawless computer will result in equilibrium. Introduction of imperfection will lead to its disruption either through loss to the player who makes the mistake, or through negation of the common knowledge criterion leading to possible victory for the player. (An example would be a player suddenly putting the car into reverse in the game of chicken, ensuring a no-loss no-win scenario).
# In many cases, the third condition is not met because, even though the equilibrium must exist, it is unknown due to the complexity of the game, for instance in Chinese chess. Or, if known, it may not be known to all players, as when playing tic-tac-toe with a small child who desperately wants to win (meeting the other criteria).
# The criterion of common knowledge may not be met even if all players do, in fact, meet all the other criteria. Players wrongly distrusting each other&#x27;s rationality may adopt counter-strategies to expected irrational play on their opponents’ behalf. This is a major consideration in &quot;chicken&quot; or an arms race, for example.

=== Where the conditions are met ===
In his Ph.D. dissertation, John Nash proposed two interpretations of his equilibrium concept, with the objective of showing how equilibrium points can be connected with observable phenomenon.

This idea was formalized by R. Aumann and A. Brandenburger, 1995, &quot;Epistemic Conditions for Nash Equilibrium&quot;, Econometrica, 63, 1161-1180 who interpreted each player&#x27;s mixed strategy as a conjecture about the behaviour of other players and have shown that if the game and the rationality of players is mutually known and these conjectures are commonly known, then the conjectures must be a Nash equilibrium (a common prior assumption is needed for this result in general, but not in the case of two players. In this case, the conjectures need only be mutually known).

A second interpretation, that Nash referred to by the mass action interpretation, is less demanding on players:

For a formal result along these lines, see Kuhn, H. and et al., 1996, &quot;The Work of John Nash in Game Theory&quot;, &quot;Journal of Economic Theory&quot;, 69, 153–185.

Due to the limited conditions in which NE can actually be observed, they are rarely treated as a guide to day-to-day behaviour, or observed in practice in human negotiations. However, as a theoretical concept in economics and evolutionary biology, the NE has explanatory power. The payoff in economics is utility (or sometimes money), and in evolutionary biology is gene transmission; both are the fundamental bottom line of survival. Researchers who apply games theory in these fields claim that strategies failing to maximize these for whatever reason will be competed out of the market or environment, which are ascribed the ability to test all strategies. This conclusion is drawn from the &quot;stability&quot; theory above. In these situations the assumption that the strategy observed is actually a NE has often been borne out by research.

== NE and non-credible threats ==

The Nash equilibrium is a superset of the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. The subgame perfect equilibrium in addition to the Nash equilibrium requires that the strategy also is a Nash equilibrium in every subgame of that game. This eliminates all non-credible threats, that is, strategies that contain non-rational moves in order to make the counter-player change their strategy.

The image to the right shows a simple sequential game that illustrates the issue with subgame imperfect Nash equilibria. In this game player one chooses left(L) or right(R), which is followed by player two being called upon to be kind (K) or unkind (U) to player one, However, player two only stands to gain from being unkind if player one goes left. If player one goes right the rational player two would de facto be kind to her/him in that subgame. However, The non-credible threat of being unkind at 2(2) is still part of the blue (L, (U,U)) Nash equilibrium. Therefore, if rational behavior can be expected by both parties the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium may be a more meaningful solution concept when such dynamic inconsistencies arise.

==Proof of existence==

=== Proof using the Kakutani fixed-point theorem ===
Nash&#x27;s original proof (in his thesis) used Brouwer&#x27;s fixed-point theorem (e.g., see below for a variant). This section presents a simpler proof via the Kakutani fixed-point theorem, following Nash&#x27;s 1950 paper (he credits David Gale with the observation that such a simplification is possible).

To prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium, let formula_20 be the best response of player i to the strategies of all other players.
:formula_21

Here, formula_22, where formula_23, is a mixed-strategy profile in the set of all mixed strategies and formula_24 is the payoff function for player i. Define a set-valued function formula_25 such that formula_26. The existence of a Nash equilibrium is equivalent to formula_27 having a fixed point.

Kakutani&#x27;s fixed point theorem guarantees the existence of a fixed point if the following four conditions are satisfied.
# formula_28 is compact, convex, and nonempty.
# formula_29 is nonempty.
# formula_29 is upper hemicontinuous
# formula_29 is convex.

Condition 1. is satisfied from the fact that formula_32 is a simplex and thus compact. Convexity follows from players&#x27; ability to mix strategies. formula_32 is nonempty as long as players have strategies.

Condition 2. and 3. are satisfied by way of Berge&#x27;s maximum theorem. Because formula_24 is continuous and compact, formula_35 is non-empty and upper hemicontinuous.

Condition 4. is satisfied as a result of mixed strategies. Suppose formula_36, then formula_37. i.e. if two strategies maximize payoffs, then a mix between the two strategies will yield the same payoff.

Therefore, there exists a fixed point in formula_38 and a Nash equilibrium.

When Nash made this point to John von Neumann in 1949, von Neumann famously dismissed it with the words, &quot;That&#x27;s trivial, you know. That&#x27;s just a fixed-point theorem.&quot; (See Nasar, 1998, p. 94.)

=== Alternate proof using the Brouwer fixed-point theorem ===

We have a game formula_39 where formula_40 is the number of players and formula_41 is the action set for the players. All of the action sets formula_42 are finite. Let formula_43 denote the set of mixed strategies for the players. The finiteness of the formula_42s ensures the compactness of formula_45.

We can now define the gain functions. For a mixed strategy formula_46, we let the gain for player formula_2 on action formula_48 be

:formula_49

The gain function represents the benefit a player gets by unilaterally changing their strategy. We now define formula_50 where

:formula_51

for formula_52. We see that

:formula_53

Next we define:

:formula_54

It is easy to see that each formula_55 is a valid mixed strategy in formula_56. It is also easy to check that each formula_55 is a continuous function of formula_58, and hence formula_59 is a continuous function. As the cross product of a finite number of compact convex sets, formula_45 is also compact and convex. Applying the Brouwer fixed point theorem to formula_59 and formula_45 we conclude that formula_59 has a fixed point in formula_45, call it formula_65. We claim that formula_65 is a Nash equilibrium in formula_67. For this purpose, it suffices to show that

:formula_68

This simply states that each player gains no benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy, which is exactly the necessary condition for a Nash equilibrium.

Now assume that the gains are not all zero. Therefore, formula_69 and formula_48 such that formula_71. Then

:formula_72

So let

:formula_73

Also we shall denote formula_74 as the gain vector indexed by actions in formula_42. Since formula_65 is the fixed point we have:

:formula_77

Since formula_78 we have that formula_79 is some positive scaling of the vector formula_80. Now we claim that

:formula_81

To see this, first if formula_71 then this is true by definition of the gain function. Now assume that formula_83. By our previous statements we have that

:formula_84

and so the left term is zero, giving us that the entire expression is formula_85 as needed.

So we finally have that

:formula_86

where the last inequality follows since formula_79 is a non-zero vector. But this is a clear contradiction, so all the gains must indeed be zero. Therefore, formula_65 is a Nash equilibrium for formula_67 as needed.

== Computing Nash equilibria ==
If a player A has a dominant strategy formula_90 then there exists a Nash equilibrium in which A plays formula_90. In the case of two players A and B, there exists a Nash equilibrium in which A plays formula_90 and B plays a best response to formula_90. If formula_90 is a strictly dominant strategy, A plays formula_90 in all Nash equilibria. If both A and B have strictly dominant strategies, there exists a unique Nash equilibrium in which each plays their strictly dominant strategy.

In games with mixed-strategy Nash equilibria, the probability of a player choosing any particular (so pure) strategy can be computed by assigning a variable to each strategy that represents a fixed probability for choosing that strategy. In order for a player to be willing to randomize, their expected payoff for each (pure) strategy should be the same. In addition, the sum of the probabilities for each strategy of a particular player should be 1. This creates a system of equations from which the probabilities of choosing each strategy can be derived.

=== Examples ===
In the matching pennies game, player A loses a point to B if A and B play the same strategy and wins a point from B if they play different strategies. To compute the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium, assign A the probability formula_96 of playing H and formula_97 of playing T, and assign B the probability formula_98 of playing H and formula_99 of playing T.

formula_100

Thus, a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium in this game is for each player to randomly choose H or T with formula_101 and formula_102.

== Oddness of equilibrium points ==
In 1971, Robert Wilson came up with the &quot;oddness theorem&quot;, which says that &quot;almost all&quot; finite games have a finite and odd number of Nash equilibria. In 1993, Harsanyi published an alternative proof of the result. &quot;Almost all&quot; here means that any game with an infinite or even number of equilibria is very special in the sense that if its payoffs were even slightly randomly perturbed, with probability one it would have an odd number of equilibria instead.

The prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, for example, has one equilibrium, while the battle of the sexes has three—two pure and one mixed, and this remains true even if the payoffs change slightly. The free money game is an example of a &quot;special&quot; game with an even number of equilibria. In it, two players have to both vote &quot;yes&quot; rather than &quot;no&quot; to get a reward and the votes are simultaneous. There are two pure-strategy Nash equilibria, (yes, yes) and (no, no), and no mixed strategy equilibria, because the strategy &quot;yes&quot; weakly dominates &quot;no&quot;. &quot;Yes&quot; is as good as &quot;no&quot; regardless of the other player&#x27;s action, but if there is any chance the other player chooses &quot;yes&quot; then &quot;yes&quot; is the best reply. Under a small random perturbation of the payoffs, however, the probability that any two payoffs would remain tied, whether at 0 or some other number, is vanishingly small, and the game would have either one or three equilibria instead.
