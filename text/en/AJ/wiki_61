<text>Joseph Paul DiMaggio (; born Giuseppe Paolo DiMaggio, ; November 25, 1914 – March 8, 1999), nicknamed &quot;Joltin&#x27; Joe&quot;, &quot;the Yankee Clipper&quot; and &quot;Joe D.&quot;, was an American professional baseball center fielder who played his entire 13-year career in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees. Born to Italian immigrants in California, he is considered to be one of the greatest baseball players of all time and set the record for the longest hitting streak (56 games from May 15 – July 16, 1941).

DiMaggio was a three-time American League (AL) Most Valuable Player Award winner and an All-Star in each of his 13 seasons. During his tenure with the Yankees, the club won ten American League pennants and nine World Series championships. His nine career World Series rings are second only to fellow Yankee Yogi Berra, who won 10.

At the time of his retirement after the 1951 season, he ranked fifth in career home runs (361) and sixth in career slugging percentage (.579). He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1955 and was voted the sport&#x27;s greatest living player in a poll taken during baseball&#x27;s centennial year of 1969. His brothers Vince (1912–1986) and Dom (1917–2009) also were major league center fielders. Outside of baseball, DiMaggio is also widely known for his marriage and life-long devotion to Marilyn Monroe.

== Early life ==
Giuseppe Paolo DiMaggio was born on November 25, 1914, in Martinez, California, the eighth of nine children born to Italian (Sicilian) immigrants Giuseppe and Rosalia DiMaggio, from Isola delle Femmine. His Italian birth name was Giuseppe Paolo DiMaggio. Rosalia named her son &quot;Giuseppe&quot; after his father in the hopes he would be her last child; &quot;Paolo&quot; was in honor of Giuseppe&#x27;s favorite saint, Paul of Tarsus.

Giuseppe was a fisherman, as were generations of DiMaggios before him. DiMaggio&#x27;s brother Tom told Maury Allen that Rosalia&#x27;s father wrote to her saying Giuseppe could earn a better living in California. Giuseppe and Rosalia decided that he would go to the United States for one year: if things were better, he would send for her; if not, he would return home. After being processed on Ellis Island, Giuseppe worked his way across the country, eventually settling near Rosalia&#x27;s father in Pittsburg, on the east side of the San Francisco Bay Area. After four years, he had earned enough money to send for Rosalia and their daughter, who was born after he left. When Joe was a toddler, Giuseppe moved his family to the North Beach section of San Francisco. Giuseppe hoped that his five sons would become fishermen.

DiMaggio recalled that he would do anything to get out of cleaning his father&#x27;s boat, as the smell of dead fish nauseated him. Giuseppe called him &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;good-for-nothing&quot;. At age ten, he took up baseball, playing third base at the North Beach playground near his home. After attending Hancock Elementary and Francisco Middle School, DiMaggio dropped out of Galileo High School and worked odd jobs.
By 1931, DiMaggio was playing semi-pro ball. Nearing the end of the 1932 season, his brother Vince, playing for the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League (PCL), talked his manager into letting DiMaggio fill in at shortstop. He made his professional debut on October 1, 1932, playing the last three games. In less than two years, DiMaggio made the jump from the playground to the PCL, one notch below the majors. In his full rookie year, from May 27 to July 25, 1933, he hit safely in 61 consecutive games, a PCL-record, and second-longest in Minor League Baseball history. &quot;Baseball didn&#x27;t really get into my blood until I knocked off that hitting streak,&quot; he said. &quot;Getting a daily hit became more important to me than eating, drinking, or sleeping.”

In 1934, DiMaggio suffered a potentially career-threatening knee injury when he tore ligaments of his right knee while stepping out of a jitney. Convinced the injury would heal, Yankees scout Bill Essick pestered his bosses to give DiMaggio another look. After he passed a physical, the team bought him for $50,000 and five players, with the Seals keeping him for the 1935 season. DiMaggio batted .398 with 154 runs batted in (RBIs) and 34 home runs. The Seals won the 1935 PCL title, and he was named the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player.

== Professional career ==
=== New York Yankees (1936–1942, 1946–1951) ===
DiMaggio made his Major League debut on May 3, 1936, batting ahead of Lou Gehrig in the lineup. The Yankees had not been to the World Series since 1932, but they won the next four World Series. Over the course of his 13-year Major League career, DiMaggio led the Yankees to nine World Series championships, where he trails only Yogi Berra (10) in that category.

DiMaggio set a franchise record for rookies in 1936 by hitting 29 home runs. DiMaggio accomplished the feat in 138 games. His record stood for over 80 years until it was shattered by Aaron Judge, who tallied 52 homers in 2017.

In 1937, DiMaggio built upon his rookie season by leading the majors with 46 home runs, 151 runs scored, and 418 total bases. He also hit safely in 43 of 44 games from June 27 to August 12. He finished second in American League MVP voting in a close race with Charlie Gehringer of the Detroit Tigers.

In 1939, DiMaggio was nicknamed &quot;the Yankee Clipper&quot; by Yankee&#x27;s play-by-play announcer Arch McDonald, when he likened DiMaggio&#x27;s speed and range in the outfield to the then-new Pan American airliner. That year in August, DiMaggio recorded 53 RBIs, tying Hack Wilson&#x27;s 1930 record for most in a single month. He also won his first career batting title and MVP award, as well as leading the Yankees to their fourth consecutive World Series championship.

DiMaggio was pictured with his son on the cover of the inaugural issue of &quot;SPORT&quot; magazine in September 1946.

In 1947, DiMaggio won his third MVP award and his sixth World Series with the Yankees. That year, Boston Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey and Yankees GM Larry MacPhail verbally agreed to trade DiMaggio for Ted Williams, but the trade was canceled when MacPhail refused to include Yogi Berra.

In the September 1949 issue of &quot;SPORT&quot;, Hank Greenberg said that DiMaggio covered so much ground in center field that the only way to get a hit against the Yankees was &quot;to hit &#x27;em where Joe wasn&#x27;t.&quot; DiMaggio also stole home five times in his career.

On February 7, 1949, DiMaggio signed a contract worth $100,000 ($ in current dollar terms) ($70,000 plus bonuses), and became the first baseball player to break $100,000 in earnings. By 1950, he was ranked the second-best center fielder by the &quot;Sporting News&quot;, after Larry Doby. After a poor 1951 season, various injuries, and a scouting report by the Brooklyn Dodgers that was turned over to the New York Giants and leaked to the press, DiMaggio announced his retirement at age 37 on December 11, 1951. When remarking on his retirement to the &quot;Sporting News&quot; on December 19, 1951, he said:
I feel like I have reached the stage where I can no longer produce for my club, my manager, and my teammates. I had a poor year, but even if I had hit .350, this would have been my last year. I was full of aches and pains and it had become a chore for me to play. When baseball is no longer fun, it&#x27;s no longer a game, and so, I&#x27;ve played my last game.

Through May 2009, DiMaggio was tied with Mark McGwire for third place all-time in home runs over the first two calendar years in the major leagues (77), behind Phillies Hall of Famer Chuck Klein (83), and Milwaukee Brewers&#x27; Ryan Braun (79). Through 2011, he was one of seven major leaguers to have had at least four 30-homer, 100-RBI seasons in their first five years, along with Chuck Klein, Ted Williams, Ralph Kiner, Mark Teixeira, Albert Pujols, and Ryan Braun. DiMaggio holds the record for most seasons with more home runs than strikeouts (minimum 20 home runs), a feat he accomplished seven times, and five times consecutively from 1937 to 1941. DiMaggio could have possibly exceeded 500 home runs and 2,000 RBIs had he not served in the military during World War II, causing him to miss the 1943, 1944, and 1945 seasons.

DiMaggio might have had better power-hitting statistics had his home park not been Yankee Stadium. In &quot;The House That Ruth Built&quot;, its nearby right field favored the Babe&#x27;s left-handed power. For right-handed hitters, its deep left and center fields made home runs almost impossible. Mickey Mantle recalled that he and Whitey Ford witnessed many DiMaggio blasts that would have been home runs anywhere other than Yankee Stadium (Ruth himself fell victim to that problem, as he also hit many long flyouts to center). Bill James calculated that DiMaggio lost more home runs due to his home park than any other player in history. Left-center field went as far back as 457 ft [139 m], whereas left-center rarely reaches 380 ft [116 m] in today&#x27;s ballparks. Al Gionfriddo&#x27;s famous catch in the 1947 World Series, which was close to the 415-foot mark [126 m] in left-center, just in front of the visitors bullpen, would have been a home run in the Yankees&#x27; current ballpark and most other ballparks at that time, except perhaps the Polo Grounds, home of the New York Giants. DiMaggio hit 148 home runs in 3,360 at-bats at home versus 213 home runs in 3,461 at-bats on the road. His slugging percentage at home was .546, and on the road, it was .610. Statistician Bill Jenkinson commented on these figures:

For example, Joe DiMaggio was acutely handicapped by playing at Yankee Stadium. Every time he batted in his home field during his entire career, he did so knowing that it was physically impossible for him to hit a home run to the half of the field directly in front of him. If you look at a baseball field from foul line to foul line, it has a 90-degree radius. From the power alley in the left-center field (430 in Joe&#x27;s time) to the fence in the deep right-center field (407 ft), it is 45 degrees. And Joe DiMaggio never hit a single home run over the fences at Yankee Stadium in that 45-degree graveyard. It was just too far. Joe was plenty strong; he routinely hit balls in the 425-foot range. But that just wasn&#x27;t good enough in the cavernous Yankee Stadium. Like Ruth, he benefited from a few easy homers each season due to the short foul line distances. But he lost many more than he gained by constantly hitting long flyouts toward center field. Whereas most sluggers perform better on their home fields, DiMaggio hit only 41 percent of his career home runs in the Bronx. He hit 148 homers at Yankee Stadium. If he had hit the same exact pattern of batted balls with a typical modern stadium as his home, he would have belted about 225 homers during his home-field career.
DiMaggio became eligible for the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1953 but he was not elected until 1955. The Hall of Fame rules on the post-retirement induction waiting period had been revised in the interim, extending the waiting period from one to five years, but DiMaggio and Ted Lyons were exempted from the rule. DiMaggio told &quot;Baseball Digest&quot; in 1963 that the Brooklyn Dodgers had offered him their managerial job in 1953, but he turned it down. After being out of baseball since his retirement as an active player, DiMaggio joined the newly relocated Oakland Athletics as a vice president in 1968 and 1969 and a coach in just the first of those two seasons. The appointment allowed him to qualify 
for MLB&#x27;s maximum pension allowance of which he had fallen two years short upon his retirement. During his only campaign as a coach, he helped improve the talents of players such as Reggie Jackson, Sal Bando, and Joe Rudi who became part of the team&#x27;s nucleus which won three consecutive World Series in 1972, 1973, and 1974.

After he resigned from the Athletics, DiMaggio was named the acting manager for the East team in the East-West Major League Baseball Classic which was held in honor of the late Martin Luther King Jr., raising charity money for King&#x27;s causes.

=== 1941 hitting streak ===


DiMaggio&#x27;s most famous achievement is his MLB record-breaking 56-game hitting streak in 1941. The streak began on May 15, a couple of weeks before the death of Lou Gehrig—who had been DiMaggio&#x27;s teammate from 1936 to 1939—when DiMaggio went one-for-four against Chicago White Sox pitcher Eddie Smith. Major newspapers began to write about DiMaggio&#x27;s streak early on, but as he approached George Sisler&#x27;s modern-era record of 41 games, it became a national phenomenon. Initially, DiMaggio showed little interest in breaking Sisler&#x27;s record, saying: &quot;I&#x27;m not thinking a whole lot about it... I&#x27;ll either break it or I won&#x27;t.&quot; As he approached Sisler&#x27;s record, DiMaggio showed more interest, saying, &quot;At the start, I didn&#x27;t think much about it... but naturally I&#x27;d like to get the record since I am this close.&quot; On June 29, 1941, DiMaggio doubled in the first game of a doubleheader against the Washington Senators at Griffith Stadium to tie Sisler&#x27;s record and then singled in the nightcap to extend his streak to 42.

A Yankee Stadium crowd of 52,832 fans watched DiMaggio tie the all-time hitting streak record (44 games, Wee Willie Keeler in 1897) on July 1. The next day against the Boston Red Sox, he homered into Yankee Stadium&#x27;s left-field stands to extend his streak to 45, setting a new record. DiMaggio recorded 67 hits in 179 at-bats during the first 45 games of his streak, while Keeler recorded 88 hits in 201 at-bats. DiMaggio continued hitting after breaking Keeler&#x27;s record, reaching 50 straight games on July 11 against the St. Louis Browns. On July 17 at Cleveland&#x27;s Municipal Stadium, DiMaggio&#x27;s streak was finally snapped at 56 games, thanks in part to two backhand stops by Indians third baseman Ken Keltner. DiMaggio batted .408 during the streak with 15 home runs and 55 RBI. The day after the streak ended DiMaggio started another streak that lasted 16 games, therefore hitting safely in 72 of 73 games. The closest anyone has come to equaling DiMaggio is Pete Rose, who hit safely in 44 straight games in 1978. During the streak, DiMaggio played in seven doubleheaders. The Yankees&#x27; record during the streak was 41–13–2.

Some consider DiMaggio&#x27;s streak a uniquely outstanding and unbreakable record and a statistical near-impossibility. Nobel Prize-winning physicist and sabermetrician Edward Mills Purcell calculated that, to have the likelihood of a hitting streak of 50 games occurring in the history of baseball up to the late 1980s be greater than 50%, fifty-two .350 lifetime hitters would have to have existed instead of the actual three (Ty Cobb, Rogers Hornsby, and Shoeless Joe Jackson). His Harvard colleague Stephen Jay Gould, citing Purcell&#x27;s work, called DiMaggio&#x27;s 56-game achievement &quot;the most extraordinary thing that ever happened in American sports&quot;. Samuel Arbesman and Steven Strogatz of Cornell University disagree. They conducted 10,000 computer simulations of Major League Baseball from 1871 to 2005, 42% of which produced streaks as long or longer, with record streaks ranging from 39 to 109 games and typical record streaks between 50 and 64 games.

== World War II ==
DiMaggio enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces on February 17, 1943, rising to the rank of sergeant. He was stationed at Santa Ana, California, Hawaii, and Atlantic City, New Jersey, as a physical education instructor. He was released on a medical discharge in September 1945, due to chronic stomach ulcers. Other than being paid $21 a month, DiMaggio&#x27;s service was as comfortable as a soldier&#x27;s life could be. He spent most of his military career playing for baseball teams and in exhibition games against fellow Major Leaguers and minor league players, and superiors gave him special privileges due to his prewar fame. DiMaggio ate so well from an athlete-only diet that he gained 10 pounds, and while in Hawaii he and other players mostly tanned on the beach and drank. Embarrassed by his lifestyle, DiMaggio requested that he be given a combat assignment but was turned down.

=== Parents as &quot;enemy aliens&quot; ===
Giuseppe and Rosalia DiMaggio, both from Isola delle Femmine, were among the thousands of German, Japanese, and Italian immigrants classified as &quot;enemy aliens&quot; by the government after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Each was required to carry photo ID booklets at all times and was not allowed to travel outside a five-mile radius from their home without a permit. Giuseppe was barred from San Francisco Bay, where he had fished for decades, and his boat was seized. Rosalia became an American citizen in 1945, followed by Giuseppe in 1946.

== Marriages ==
=== Dorothy Arnold ===
In January 1937, DiMaggio met actress Dorothy Arnold on the set of &quot;Manhattan Merry-Go-Round&quot;, in which he had a minor role, and she was an extra. He announced their engagement on April 25, 1939, just before the Yankees were to meet the Philadelphia Athletics. They married at Saints Peter and Paul Church, San Francisco on November 19, 1939, as 20,000 well-wishers jammed the streets. The couple&#x27;s son, Joseph Paul DiMaggio Jr. (1941–1999), was born at Doctors&#x27; Hospital in Staten Island. Their marriage was troubled, as Arnold wanted DiMaggio to settle down and be a father to their son and a nearby husband to her; DiMaggio was more interested in the public eye. The couple divorced in 1944, while DiMaggio was on leave from the Yankees during World War II.

=== Marilyn Monroe ===

According to her autobiography &quot;My Story&quot;, co-written with Ben Hecht, American actress Marilyn Monroe originally did not want to meet DiMaggio, fearing he was a stereotypically arrogant athlete. However, they did meet in Los Angeles while on a blind date. After dating for two years, they eloped at San Francisco City Hall on January 14, 1954. Although she suffered from endometriosis, Monroe and DiMaggio each expressed to reporters their desire to start a family.

The union was troubled from the start by DiMaggio&#x27;s jealousy, controlling attitude, and him physically abusing Monroe, as well as her busy life as an actress. A violent fight entailing physical assault between the couple occurred immediately after Monroe filmed the skirt-blowing scene in &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot; that was filmed on September 14, 1954, in front of Manhattan&#x27;s Trans-Lux 52nd Street Theater, as DiMaggio disapproved of the scene. Then 20th Century Fox&#x27;s East Coast correspondent Bill Kobrin told the &quot;Palm Springs Desert Sun&quot; that it was director Billy Wilder&#x27;s idea to turn the shoot into a media circus. Monroe and DiMaggio then had a &quot;yelling battle&quot; in the theater lobby. After returning from New York City to Hollywood in October 1954, Monroe filed for divorce from DiMaggio after only nine months of marriage. However, she was devastated to leave DiMaggio, and throughout the procedures in court, she could be seen weeping openly.

DiMaggio was also devastated, and wrote to Monroe, saying, &quot;I love you and want to be with you…There is nothing I would like better than to restore your confidence in me…My heart split even wider seeing you cry in front of all those people.&quot; He also wrote, “[I don&#x27;t] know what your thoughts are about me, but I can tell you I love you sincerely — way deep in my heart, irregardless of anything.&quot; After the divorce, DiMaggio underwent therapy, stopped drinking alcohol, and expanded his interests beyond baseball.

On August 1, 1956, an International News wire photo of DiMaggio with Lee Meriwether gave rise to speculation that they were engaged, but DiMaggio biographer Richard Ben Cramer wrote that it was a rumor started by columnist Walter Winchell. Monroe biographer Donald Spoto claimed that DiMaggio was &quot;very close to marrying&quot; 1957 Miss America Marian McKnight, who won the crown with a Marilyn Monroe act, but McKnight denied it. He was also linked to Liz Renay, Cleo Moore, Rita Gam, Marlene Dietrich, and Gloria DeHaven during this period, and years later to Elizabeth Ray and Morgan Fairchild, but he never publicly confirmed any involvement with any woman.
DiMaggio re-entered Monroe&#x27;s life as her marriage to Arthur Miller was ending. On February 10, 1961, he secured her release from Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic in Manhattan. She joined him in Florida where he was a batting coach for the Yankees. Their &quot;just friends&quot; claim did not stop remarriage rumors from flying. Reporters staked out her Manhattan apartment building. Bob Hope &quot;dedicated&quot; Best Song nominee &quot;The Second Time Around&quot; to them at the 33rd Academy Awards.

According to Maury Allen&#x27;s biography, DiMaggio was alarmed at how Monroe had fallen in with people he felt were detrimental to her well-being. Val Monette, the owner of a military post-exchange supply company, told Allen that DiMaggio left his employ on August 1, 1962, because he had decided to ask Monroe to remarry him.

Four days later, on August 5, Monroe was found dead in her Brentwood, Los Angeles home after her housekeeper Eunice R. Murray telephoned Monroe&#x27;s psychiatrist, Ralph Greenson. DiMaggio&#x27;s son had spoken to Monroe on the phone the night of her death and said she seemed fine. Her death was deemed a probable suicide by &quot;Coroner to the Stars&quot; Thomas Noguchi. It has also been the subject of conspiracy theories.

The funeral service was arranged by DiMaggio, Monroe&#x27;s half-sister Berniece Baker Miracle, and Monroe&#x27;s business manager Inez Melson. He barred Hollywood&#x27;s elite and members of the Kennedy family from attending the funeral, including President John F. Kennedy. He had a half-dozen red roses delivered to her crypt three times a week for 20 years. Oftentimes, he refused to talk about her publicly or otherwise exploit their relationship, and in the rare moments when he did speak to reporters, he was unable to hold back tears. He never married again.

According to DiMaggio&#x27;s attorney Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio&#x27;s last words were &quot;I&#x27;ll finally get to see Marilyn.&quot; Though DiMaggio&#x27;s brother Dominic challenged Engelberg&#x27;s version of Joe&#x27;s final moments and his motives, Engleberg continuously denied those who questioned DiMaggio&#x27;s last words, reporting that one night when he and a terminally ill DiMaggio were sitting together, DiMaggio told him, &quot;I don’t feel bad about dying. At least I’ll be with Marilyn again.&quot;
== Advertising ==

In the 1970s, DiMaggio became a spokesman for Mr. Coffee, and was the face of the electric drip coffee makers for over 20 years. Vincent Marotta, the CEO of North American Systems, which manufactured Mr. Coffee at the time, recruited DiMaggio for the advertising campaign. DiMaggio&#x27;s spots were successful with consumers. In a 2007 interview with &quot;The Columbus Dispatch&quot;, Marotta joked that &quot;millions of kids grew up thinking Joe DiMaggio was a famous appliance salesman.&quot; Despite the commercials, DiMaggio rarely drank coffee due to ulcers; and when he did drink coffee, he preferred Sanka instant coffee rather than coffee brewed by Mr. Coffee machines.

In 1972, DiMaggio became a spokesman for the Bowery Savings Bank. Except for a five-year hiatus in the 1980s, he regularly made commercials for them until 1992. In 1986, he became a spokesperson for Florida&#x27;s Cross Keys Village, an active retirement community.

== Television programs ==
Beginning in April 1952, DiMaggio had 10-minute programs on Channel 11 in New York City before and after each Yankees&#x27; home game. Episodes included interviews with guests and DiMaggio&#x27;s comments about baseball. The team owned the program, with DiMaggio under contract to the Yankees. He also did &quot;Joe DiMaggio&#x27;s Dugout&quot; on Channel 4 in New York City, a weekly filmed program unrelated to the pre-and post-game shows. It featured instructional sessions and quizzes for young people.

== Death ==

DiMaggio was a heavy smoker for much of his adult life. He was admitted to Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Florida, on October 12, 1998, for lung cancer surgery and remained there for 99 days. He returned to his home in Hollywood, Florida, on January 19, 1999, where he died on March 8 at age 84. DiMaggio&#x27;s attorney, Morris Engleberg reported that his last words were, &quot;I&#x27;ll finally get to see Marilyn,&quot; referencing his ex-wife Marilyn Monroe.

DiMaggio&#x27;s funeral was held on March 11, 1999, at Saints Peter and Paul Church in San Francisco, and he was interred three months later at Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California. His son also died that year, on August 6, at age 57.

== Legacy ==
At his death, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called DiMaggio&#x27;s 1941 56-game hitting streak &quot;perhaps the most enduring record in sports.&quot;

According to American geneticist Mary-Claire King, in the spring of 1981 DiMaggio babysat her daughter at the San Francisco airport so King could drop her mother off to her flight to Chicago. According to King, if it were not for DiMaggio&#x27;s kindness, she would have almost certainly missed her own flight that was taking her and her daughter to Washington, D.C., a trip that eventually resulted in King&#x27;s getting her first major grant from the National Institutes of Health and the discovery of the breast and ovarian cancer-causing gene BRCA1.

On September 17, 1992, the doors were opened at Joe DiMaggio Children&#x27;s Hospital at Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Florida, for which he raised over $4 million.
On April 13, 1998, DiMaggio was given the Sports Legend Award at the 13th annual American Sportscasters Association Hall of Fame Awards Dinner in New York City. Henry Kissinger, former Secretary of State and a longtime fan of DiMaggio, made the presentation to the Yankee great. The event was one of DiMaggio&#x27;s last public appearances before taking ill.

Yankee Stadium&#x27;s fifth monument was dedicated to DiMaggio on April 25, 1999, and the West Side Highway was officially renamed The Joe DiMaggio Highway in his honor. The Yankees wore DiMaggio&#x27;s number 5 on the left sleeves of their uniforms for the 1999 season. He is ranked No. 11 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and he was elected by fans to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In addition to his number 5 being retired by the New York Yankees, DiMaggio&#x27;s number was also retired by the Florida Marlins, who retired it in honor of their first team president, Carl Barger, who died five months before the team took the field for the first time in 1993. DiMaggio had been his favorite player.

In 2000 after some negotiations, the heirs of Joe DiMaggio&#x27;s estate, two granddaughters and their four children, welcomed the renaming of San Francisco&#x27;s North Beach playground, the place where Joe DiMaggio first took up baseball as a boy, as the Joe DiMaggio North Beach Playground.

In 2001, Major League Baseball introduced an online daily fantasy game called &quot;Beat the Streak&quot; which required players to pick one or two MLB players to get a hit in a game that day. The goal was to pick correctly 57 times in a row to beat DiMaggio&#x27;s record streak. , the prize money for beating the streak was $5.6 million; more than 4.5 million players had combined to make over 100 million attempts but none had reached even 52 consecutive hits in the game&#x27;s history.

In May 2006, the adopted daughters of DiMaggio&#x27;s son held an auction of DiMaggio&#x27;s personal items. Highlights included the ball he hit in breaking Wee Willie Keeler&#x27;s hitting-streak record ($63,250); his 2,000th career hit ball ($29,900); his 1947 Most Valuable Player Award ($281,750); the uniform worn in the 1951 World Series ($195,500); his Hall of Fame ring ($69,000); a photograph Marilyn autographed &quot;I love you Joe&quot; ($80,500); her passport ($115,000); and their marriage certificate ($23,000). Lot 758, DiMaggio&#x27;s white 1991 Mercedes 420 SEL sedan, which was a gift from the New York Yankees commemorating the 50th anniversary of DiMaggio&#x27;s 1941 season, sold for $18,000. The event netted a total of $4.1 million.
On August 8, 2011, the United States Postal Service announced that an image of DiMaggio would appear on a stamp for the first time. It was issued as part of the &quot;Major League Baseball All-Star Stamp Series,&quot; which came out in July 2012.

DiMaggio insisted on being introduced as the &quot;Greatest Living Ballplayer&quot; at events, including Yankee Old-Timers Day, and he once punched Billy Crystal in the stomach for not introducing him as such.

In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored DiMaggio as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Army Air Force during World War II.

The Joe DiMaggio Fields in his hometown of Martinez, California, are named after him.

There is a Joe DiMaggio Street in San Antonio, Texas.

== Career statistics ==

<text>The Dandenong Ranges National Park is a national park located in the Greater Melbourne region of Victoria, Australia. The national park is situated from at its westernmost points at Ferntree Gully and Boronia to at its easternmost point at Silvan, east of the Melbourne central business district.

The park was proclaimed on , amalgamating the Ferntree Gully National Park, Sherbrooke Forest and Doongalla Estate. In 1997 the Olinda State Forest, Mt. Evelyn and Montrose Reserve were formally added to the national park.

== History ==
The region was originally inhabited by the Bunurong and Woewurrong Aboriginal people. Most of the forest got cleared when it became a significant source of timber for Melbourne. During the late last century, farming began in the area as roads and railways were built and the &#x27;Puffing Billy&#x27; narrow-gauge line from Ferntree Gully to Gembrook started in 1900. Tourism flourished from the 1870s. The Fern Tree Gully was the first to be reserved as a park in 1882 followed by other areas. The present day national park was established in 1987.

==Features==
Dandenong Ranges National Park is divided into five sections:

* Doongalla Forest – Containing Mount Dandenong itself, and the SkyHigh lookout with panoramic views of Melbourne&#x27;s east
* Ferntree Gully – The south western section of the Dandenong Ranges National Park, located between the suburbs of Ferntree Gully and Boronia to the west, Upwey to the south, Tremont and Sassafras to the east and The Basin to the north. The park contains the Thousands Steps trail leading to One Tree Hill. The very steep walking trail includes over 700 steps over and commemorates the battle for the Kokoda track in Territory of Papua during World War II. The steps are a popular destination for sightseers and fitness enthusiasts alike. During the AFL pre-season a number of Melbourne Australian rules football league and association teams run their players up the steps to promote team fitness. There is no specific creation date of the steps; however, they are believed to be built during the early 1860s when they provided the only means of accessing the One Tree Hill Summit. According to a Tourist Guide published in 1868, all other areas contained thick forest vegetation. A survey of the park found that over 82% of visitors (on weekends) use the park for fitness-related walking. It is also a popular spot for picnics.
* Mount Evelyn Forest is the most northerly section of the park
* Olinda Forest occupies the eastern slopes of Mount Dandenong
* Sherbrooke Forest

==Feral pests==
Because the park is located in an urban area, the park has a long history of major problems with feral and roaming animals. A cat curfew was introduced in the entire Dandenong Ranges area in 1991, and since then the numbers and variety of lyrebirds and some other native species have climbed dramatically.

<doc id="48896" wikidata="Q214096" url="?curid=48896" title="Lyrebird">
<text>A lyrebird is either of two species of ground-dwelling Australian birds that compose the genus Menura, and the family Menuridae. They are most notable for their impressive ability to mimic natural and artificial sounds from their environment, and the striking beauty of the male bird&#x27;s huge tail when it is fanned out in courtship display. Lyrebirds have unique plumes of neutral-coloured tailfeathers and are among Australia&#x27;s best-known native birds.

== Taxonomy ==
The classification of lyrebirds was the subject of much debate after the first specimens reached European scientists after 1798. Based on specimens sent from New South Wales to England, Major-General Thomas Davies illustrated and described this species as the superb lyrebird, which he called &quot;Menura superba&quot;, in an 1800 presentation to the Linnean Society of London, but this work was not published until 1802; in the intervening time period, however, the species was described and named &quot;Menura novaehollandiae&quot; by John Latham in 1801, and this is the accepted name by virtue of nomenclatural priority.

The genus name &quot;Menura&quot; refers to the pattern of repeated transparent crescents (or &quot;lunules&quot;) on the superb lyrebird&#x27;s outer tail-feathers, from the Ancient Greek words &quot;mēnē&quot; &quot;moon&quot; and &quot;ourá&quot; &quot;tail&quot;.

Lyrebirds are named because their outer tail feathers are broad and curved in a S shape that together resemble the shape of a lyre. 

=== Systematics ===
Lyrebirds were thought to be Galliformes like the broadly similar looking partridge, junglefowl, and pheasants familiar to Europeans, reflected in the early names given to the superb lyrebird, including native pheasant. They were also called peacock-wrens and Australian birds-of-paradise. The idea that they were related to the pheasants was abandoned when the first chicks, which are altricial, were described. They were not classed with the passerines until a paper was published in 1840, twelve years after they were assigned a discrete family, Menuridae. Within that family they compose a single genus, &quot;Menura&quot;.

It is generally accepted that the lyrebird family is most closely related to the scrub-birds (Atrichornithidae) and some authorities combine both in a single family, but evidence that they are also related to the bowerbirds remains controversial.

Lyrebirds are ancient Australian animals: the Australian Museum has fossils of lyrebirds dating back to about 15 million years ago. The prehistoric &quot;Menura tyawanoides&quot; has been described from Early Miocene fossils found at the famous Riversleigh site.

===Species===
Two species of lyrebird are extant:



==Description==

The lyrebirds are large passerine birds, amongst the largest in the order. They are ground living birds with strong legs and feet and short rounded wings. They are poor fliers and rarely fly except for periods of downhill gliding. The superb lyrebird is the larger of the two species. Lyrebirds measure 31 to 39 inches in length, including their tail. Males tend to be slightly larger than females. Females weigh around 2 pounds, and males weigh around 2.4 pounds.

==Distribution and habitat==
The superb lyrebird is found in areas of rainforest in Victoria, New South Wales, and south-east Queensland. It is also found in Tasmania where it was introduced in the 19th century. Many superb lyrebirds live in the Dandenong Ranges National Park and Kinglake National Park around Melbourne, the Royal National Park and Illawarra region south of Sydney, in many other parks along the east coast of Australia, and non protected bushland. Albert&#x27;s lyrebird is found only in a small area of Southern Queensland rainforest.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Lyrebirds are shy and difficult to approach, particularly the Albert&#x27;s lyrebird, with the result that little information about its behaviour has been documented. When lyrebirds detect potential danger, they pause and scan the surroundings, sound an alarm, and either flee the area on foot, or seek cover and freeze. Firefighters sheltering in mine shafts during bushfires have been joined by lyrebirds.

===Diet and feeding===
Lyrebirds feed on the ground and as individuals. A range of invertebrate prey is taken, including insects such as cockroaches, beetles (both adults and larvae), earwigs, fly larvae, and the adults and larvae of moths. Other prey taken includes centipedes, spiders, earthworms. Less commonly taken prey includes stick insects, bugs, amphipods, lizards, frogs and occasionally, seeds. They find food by scratching with their feet through the leaf-litter.

===Breeding===
Lyrebirds are long-lived birds that can live as long as 30 years. They have long breeding cycles and start breeding later in life than other passerine birds. Female superb lyrebirds start breeding at the age of five or six, and males at the age of six to eight. Males defend territories from other males, and those territories may contain the breeding territories of up to eight females. Within the male territories, the males create or use display platforms; for the superb lyrebird, this is a mound of bare soil; for the Albert&#x27;s lyrebird, it is a pile of twigs on the forest floor.

Male lyrebirds call mostly during winter, when they construct and maintain an open arena-mound in dense bush, on which they sing and dance in an elaborate courtship display performed for potential mates, of which the male lyrebird has several. The strength, volume, and location of the nest built by the female lyrebird is dependent on the rainfall and predation during the nest building period. It is important for the nest to be water resistant and hidden in secluded areas so predators cannot attack. Once the nest is made in the preferred location, the female lyrebird lays a single egg. The egg is incubated over 50 days solely by the female, and the female also fosters the chick alone.

===Vocalizations and mimicry===
A lyrebird&#x27;s song is one of the more distinctive aspects of its behavioural biology. Lyrebirds sing throughout the year, but the peak of the breeding season, from June to August, is when they sing with the most intensity. During this peak males may sing for four hours of the day, almost half the hours of daylight. The song of the lyrebird is a mixture of elements of its own song and mimicry of other species. Lyrebirds render with great fidelity the individual songs of other birds and the chatter of flocks of birds, and also mimic other animals such as possums, koalas and dingoes. Lyrebirds have been recorded mimicking human sounds such as a mill whistle, a cross-cut saw, chainsaws, car engines and car alarms, fire alarms, rifle-shots, camera shutters, dogs barking, crying babies, music, mobile phone ring tones, and even the human voice. However, while the mimicry of human noises is widely reported, the extent to which it happens is exaggerated. Parts of the lyrebird&#x27;s own song can resemble human-made sound effects, which has given rise to the urban legend that they frequently imitate video game or film sounds.

The superb lyrebird&#x27;s mimicked calls are learned from the local environment, including from other superb lyrebirds. An instructive example is the population of superb lyrebirds in Tasmania, which have retained the calls of species not native to Tasmania in their repertoire, with some local Tasmanian endemic bird songs added. The female lyrebirds of both species are also mimics capable of complex vocalisations. Superb lyrebird females are silent during courtship; however, they regularly produce sophisticated vocal displays during foraging and nest defense. A recording of a superb lyrebird mimicking sounds of an electronic shooting game, workmen and chainsaws was added to the National Film and Sound Archive&#x27;s Sounds of Australia registry in 2013.

Both species of lyrebird produced elaborate lyrebird-specific vocalisations including &#x27;whistle songs&#x27;. Males also sing songs specifically associated with their song and dance displays.

One researcher, Sydney Curtis, has recorded flute-like lyrebird calls in the vicinity of the New England National Park. Similarly, in 1969, a park ranger, Neville Fenton, recorded a lyrebird song which resembled flute sounds in the New England National Park, near Dorrigo in northern coastal New South Wales. After much detective work by Fenton, it was discovered that in the 1930s, a flute player living on a farm adjoining the park used to play tunes near his pet lyrebird. The lyrebird adopted the tunes into his repertoire, and retained them after release into the park. Neville Fenton forwarded a tape of his recording to Norman Robinson. Because a lyrebird is able to carry two tunes at the same time, Robinson filtered out one of the tunes and put it on the phonograph for the purposes of analysis. One witness suggested that the song represents a modified version of two popular tunes in the 1930s: &quot;The Keel Row&quot; and &quot;Mosquito&#x27;s Dance&quot;. Musicologist David Rothenberg has endorsed this information. However, a &quot;flute lyrebird&quot; research group (including Curtis and Fenton) formed to investigate the veracity of this story found no evidence of &quot;Mosquito Dance&quot; and only remnants of &quot;Keel Row&quot; in contemporary and historical lyrebird recordings from this area. Neither were they able to prove that a lyrebird chick had been a pet, although they acknowledged compelling evidence on both sides of the argument.

==Status and conservation==
Until the 2019–2020 Australian bushfire season, superb lyrebirds were not considered threatened in the short to medium term. Concern has since grown as early analyses have shown the extent of destruction of the lyrebird&#x27;s preferred wet-forest habitats, which in less intense previous bushfire seasons have been spared, in large part due to their moisture content. Albert&#x27;s lyrebird has a very restricted habitat and had been listed as vulnerable by the IUCN, but because the species and its habitat were carefully managed, the species was re-assessed to near threatened in 2009. The superb lyrebird had already been seriously threatened by habitat destruction in the past. Its population had since recovered, but the 2019–2020 bushfires damaged much of its habitat, which may lead to a reclassification of its status from &quot;common&quot; to &quot;threatened&quot;. Beyond this new threat are the long-term vulnerabilities to predation by cats and foxes, as well as human population pressure on its habitat.

== In culture ==
=== Painting by John Gould ===
The lyrebird is so called because the male bird has a spectacular tail, consisting of 16 highly modified feathers (two long slender &quot;lyrates&quot; at the centre of the plume, two broader &quot;medians&quot; on the outside edges and twelve &quot;filamentaries&quot; arrayed between them), which was originally thought to resemble a lyre. This happened when a superb lyrebird specimen (which had been taken from Australia to England during the early 19th century) was prepared for display at the British Museum by a taxidermist who had never seen a live lyrebird. The taxidermist mistakenly thought that the tail would resemble a lyre, and that the tail would be held in a similar way to that of a peacock during courtship display, and so he arranged the feathers in this way. Later, John Gould (who had also never seen a live lyrebird), painted the lyrebird from the British Museum specimen.

The male lyrebird&#x27;s tail is not held as in John Gould&#x27;s painting. Instead, the male lyrebird&#x27;s tail is fanned over the lyrebird during courtship display, with the tail completely covering his head and back—as can be seen in the image in the &quot;breeding&quot; section of this page, and also the image of the 10-cent coin, where the superb lyrebird&#x27;s tail (in courtship display) is portrayed accurately.

=== Lyrebird emblems and logos ===
The lyrebird has been featured as a symbol and emblem many times, especially in New South Wales and Victoria (where the superb lyrebird has its natural habitat), and in Queensland (where Albert&#x27;s lyrebird has its natural habitat).

* A male superb lyrebird is featured on the reverse of the Australian 10-cent coin.
* A superb lyrebird featured on the Australian one shilling postage stamp first issued in 1932.
* A stylised superb lyrebird appears in the transparent window of the Australian 100 dollar note.
* A silhouette of a male superb lyrebird is the logo of the Australian Film Commission.
* An illustration of a male superb lyrebird, in courtship display, is the emblem of the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service.
* The pattern on the curtains of the Victorian State Theatre is the image of a male superb lyrebird, in courtship display, as viewed from the front.
* A stylised illustration of a male Albert&#x27;s lyrebird was the logo of the Queensland Conservatorium of Music, before the Conservatorium became part of Griffith University. In the logo, the top part of the lyrebird&#x27;s tail became a music stave.
* Australian band You Am I&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;Dilettantes&quot; and its first single, &quot;Erasmus&quot;, feature a drawing of a lyrebird by artist Ken Taylor.
* A stylised illustration of part of a male superb lyrebird&#x27;s tail is the logo for the Lyrebird Arts Council of Victoria.
* The lyrebird is also featured atop the crest of Panhellenic Sorority Alpha Chi Omega, whose symbol is the lyre.
* There are many other companies with the name of &quot;Lyrebird&quot;, and these also have lyrebird logos.
* &quot;Land of the Lyrebird&quot; is an alternative name for the Strzelecki Ranges in the Gippsland region of Victoria.
* A silhouetted male superb lyrebird in courtship display features in the masthead of &quot;The Betoota Advocate&quot;.

<text>A computer simulation language is used to describe the operation of a simulation on a computer. There are two major types of simulation: continuous and discrete event though more modern languages can handle more complex combinations. Most languages also have a graphical interface and at least a simple statistic gathering capability for the analysis of the results. An important part of discrete-event languages is the ability to generate pseudo-random numbers and variants from different probability distributions.

<doc id="48900" wikidata="Q483788" url="?curid=48900" title="Atomic radius">
<text>The atomic radius of a chemical element is a measure of the size of its atom, usually the mean or typical distance from the center of the nucleus to the outermost isolated electron. Since the boundary is not a well-defined physical entity, there are various non-equivalent definitions of atomic radius. Four widely used definitions of atomic radius are: Van der Waals radius, ionic radius, metallic radius and covalent radius. Typically, because of the difficulty to isolate atoms in order to measure their radii separately, atomic radius is measured in a chemically bonded state; however theoretical calculations are simpler when considering atoms in isolation. The dependencies on environment, probe, and state lead to a multiplicity of definitions.

Depending on the definition, the term may apply to atoms in condensed matter, covalently bonding in molecules, or in ionized and excited states; and its value may be obtained through experimental measurements, or computed from theoretical models. The value of the radius may depend on the atom&#x27;s state and context.

Electrons do not have definite orbits nor sharply defined ranges. Rather, their positions must be described as probability distributions that taper off gradually as one moves away from the nucleus, without a sharp cutoff; these are referred to as atomic orbitals or electron clouds. Moreover, in condensed matter and molecules, the electron clouds of the atoms usually overlap to some extent, and some of the electrons may roam over a large region encompassing two or more atoms.

Under most definitions the radii of isolated neutral atoms range between 30 and 300 pm (trillionths of a meter), or between 0.3 and 3 ångströms. Therefore, the radius of an atom is more than 10,000 times the radius of its nucleus (1–10 fm), and less than 1/1000 of the wavelength of visible light (400–700 nm).
For many purposes, atoms can be modeled as spheres. This is only a crude approximation, but it can provide quantitative explanations and predictions for many phenomena, such as the density of liquids and solids, the diffusion of fluids through molecular sieves, the arrangement of atoms and ions in crystals, and the size and shape of molecules.

==History==

The first to estimate the radius of an atom was Johann Chrysostom Magnenus in 1646. He was at Mass and noticed the smell of incense permeating the church. He knew the size of the incense and estimated the size of the church. He presumed that he could detect the incense if one atom was in each nostril. He also presumed that the incense was distributed homogenously throughout the church. With these assumptions he was able to estimate the size of an atom to be about 10 to the power of -24 cubic metres. (The units he used have been converted to metric to make comparisons with later estimates easier.) Taking the cube root this gives an estimate of the atomic radius to be about 10 to the power of -8 metres. This is somewhat larger than current estimates but given the assumptions made in the calculation is very good. These calculations were published in his work &quot;Democritus reviviscens sive de atomis&quot;. 

The concept of atomic radius was preceded in the 19th century by the concept of atomic volume, a relative measure of how much space would on average an atom occupy in a given solid or liquid material. By the end of the century this term was also used in an absolute sense, as a molar volume divided by Avogadro constant. Such a volume is different for different crystalline forms even of the same compound, but physicists used it for rough, order-of-magnitude estimates of the atomic size, getting 10−8–10−7 cm for copper.

The earliest estimates of the atomic size was made by opticians in the 1830s, particularly Cauchy, who developed models of light dispersion assuming a lattice of connected &quot;molecules&quot;. In 1857 Clausius developed a gas-kinetic model which included the equation for mean free path. In the 1870s it was used to estimate gas molecule sizes, as well as an aforementioned comparison with visible light wavelength and an estimate from the thickness of soap bubble film at which its contractile force rapidly diminishes. By 1900, various estimates of mercury atom diameter averaged around 275±20 pm (modern estimates give 300±10 pm, see below).

In 1920, shortly after it had become possible to determine the sizes of atoms using X-ray crystallography, it was suggested that all atoms of the same element have the same radii. However, in 1923, when more crystal data had become available, it was found that the approximation of an atom as a sphere does not necessarily hold when comparing the same atom in different crystal structures.

==Definitions==

Widely used definitions of atomic radius include:

* Van der Waals radius: In the simplest definition, half the minimum distance between the nuclei of two atoms of the element that are not otherwise bound by covalent or metallic interactions. The Van der Waals radius may be defined even for elements (such as metals) in which Van der Waals forces are dominated by other interactions. Because Van der Waals interactions arise through quantum fluctuations of the atomic polarisation, the polarisability (which can usually be measured or calculated more easily) may be used to define the Van der Waals radius indirectly.

* Ionic radius: the nominal radius of the ions of an element in a specific ionization state, deduced from the spacing of atomic nuclei in crystalline salts that include that ion. In principle, the spacing between two adjacent oppositely charged ions (the length of the ionic bond between them) should equal the sum of their ionic radii.
* Covalent radius: the nominal radius of the atoms of an element when covalently bound to other atoms, as deduced from the separation between the atomic nuclei in molecules. In principle, the distance between two atoms that are bound to each other in a molecule (the length of that covalent bond) should equal the sum of their covalent radii.
* Metallic radius: the nominal radius of atoms of an element when joined to other atoms by metallic bonds.
* Bohr radius: the radius of the lowest-energy electron orbit predicted by Bohr model of the atom (1913). It is only applicable to atoms and ions with a single electron, such as hydrogen, singly ionized helium, and positronium. Although the model itself is now obsolete, the Bohr radius for the hydrogen atom is still regarded as an important physical constant, because it is equivalent to the quantum-mechanical most probable distance of the electron from the nucleus.

==Empirically measured atomic radius==

The following table shows empirically measured covalent radii for the elements, as published by J. C. Slater in 1964. The values are in picometers (pm or 1×10−12 m), with an accuracy of about 5 pm. The shade of the box ranges from red to yellow as the radius increases; gray indicates lack of data.

==Explanation of the general trends==
Electrons in atoms fill electron shells from the lowest available energy level. As a consequence of the Aufbau principle, each new period begins with the first two elements filling the next unoccupied s-orbital. Because an atom&#x27;s s-orbital electrons are typically farthest from the nucleus, this results in a significant increase in atomic radius with the first elements of each period.

The atomic radius of each element generally decreases across each period due to an increasing number of protons, since an increase in the number of protons increases the attractive force acting on the atom&#x27;s electrons. The greater attraction draws the electrons closer to the protons, decreasing the size of the atom. Down each group, the atomic radius of each element typically increases because there are more occupied 
electron energy levels and therefore a greater distance between protons and electrons.

The increasing nuclear charge is partly counterbalanced by the increasing number of electrons—a phenomenon that is known as shielding—which explains why the size of atoms usually increases down each column despite an increase in attractive force from the nucleus. Electron shielding causes the attraction of an atom&#x27;s nucleus on its electrons to decrease, so electrons occupying higher energy states farther from the nucleus experience reduced attractive force, increasing the size of the atom. However, elements in the 5d-block (lutetium to mercury) are much smaller than this trend predicts due to the weak shielding of the 4f-subshell. This phenomenon is known as the lanthanide contraction. A similar phenomenon exists for actinides; however, the general instability of transuranic elements makes measurements for the remainder of the 5f-block difficult and for transactinides nearly impossible. Finally, for sufficiently heavy elements, the atomic radius may be decreased by relativistic effects. This is a consequence of electrons near the strongly charged nucleus traveling at a sufficient fraction of the speed of light to gain a nontrivial amount of mass.

The following table summarizes the main phenomena that influence the atomic radius of an element:

===Lanthanide contraction===

The electrons in the 4f-subshell, which is progressively filled from lanthanum (&quot;Z&quot; = 57) to ytterbium (&quot;Z&quot; = 70), are not particularly effective at shielding the increasing nuclear charge from the sub-shells further out. The elements immediately following the lanthanides have atomic radii which are smaller than would be expected and which are almost identical to the atomic radii of the elements immediately above them. Hence lutetium is in fact slightly smaller than yttrium, hafnium has virtually the same atomic radius (and chemistry) as zirconium, and tantalum has an atomic radius similar to niobium, and so forth. The effect of the lanthanide contraction is noticeable up to platinum (&quot;Z&quot; = 78), after which it is masked by a relativistic effect known as the inert-pair effect.

Due to lanthanide contraction, the 5 following observations can be drawn:

# The size of Ln3+ ions regularly decreases with atomic number. According to Fajans&#x27; rules, decrease in size of Ln3+ ions increases the covalent character and decreases the basic character between Ln3+ and OH− ions in Ln(OH)3, to the point that Yb(OH)3 and Lu(OH)3 can dissolve with difficulty in hot concentrated NaOH. Hence the order of size of Ln3+ is given: La3+ &gt; Ce3+ &gt; ..., ... &gt; Lu3+.
# There is a regular decrease in their ionic radii.
# There is a regular decrease in their tendency to act as a reducing agent, with an increase in atomic number.
# The second and third rows of d-block transition elements are quite close in properties.
# Consequently, these elements occur together in natural minerals and are difficult to separate.

===d-block contraction===

The d-block contraction is less pronounced than the lanthanide contraction but arises from a similar cause. In this case, it is the poor shielding capacity of the 3d-electrons which affects the atomic radii and chemistries of the elements immediately following the first row of the transition metals, from gallium (&quot;Z&quot; = 31) to bromine (&quot;Z&quot; = 35).

==Relation to other measures==
The density of water is about 1000 kg/m3 or 1 g/cm3, because the size of the gram was originally based on the mass of a cubic centimetre of water. 

In chemistry, g/cm3 is more commonly used.

<text>Nucleosynthesis is the process that creates new atomic nuclei from pre-existing nucleons (protons and neutrons) and nuclei. According to current theories, the first nuclei were formed a few minutes after the Big Bang, through nuclear reactions in a process called Big Bang nucleosynthesis. After about 20 minutes, the universe had expanded and cooled to a point at which these high-energy collisions among nucleons ended, so only the fastest and simplest reactions occurred, leaving our universe containing hydrogen and helium. The rest is traces of other elements such as lithium and the hydrogen isotope deuterium. Nucleosynthesis in stars and their explosions later produced the variety of elements and isotopes that we have today, in a process called cosmic chemical evolution. The amounts of total mass in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium (called &#x27;metals&#x27; by astrophysicists) remains small (few percent), so that the universe still has approximately the same composition.

Stars fuse light elements to heavier ones in their cores, giving off energy in the process known as stellar nucleosynthesis. Nuclear fusion reactions create many of the lighter elements, up to and including iron and nickel in the most massive stars. Products of stellar nucleosynthesis remain trapped in stellar cores and remnants except if ejected through stellar winds and explosions. The neutron capture reactions of the r-process and s-process create heavier elements, from iron upwards.

Supernova nucleosynthesis within exploding stars is largely responsible for the elements between oxygen and rubidium: from the ejection of elements produced during stellar nucleosynthesis; through explosive nucleosynthesis during the supernova explosion; and from the r-process (absorption of multiple neutrons) during the explosion.

Neutron star mergers are a recently discovered major source of elements produced in the r-process. When two neutron stars collide, a significant amount of neutron-rich matter may be ejected which then quickly forms heavy elements.

Cosmic ray spallation is a process wherein cosmic rays impact nuclei and fragment them. It is a significant source of the lighter nuclei, particularly 3He, 9Be and 10,11B, that are not created by stellar nucleosynthesis. Cosmic ray spallation can occur in the interstellar medium, on asteroids and meteoroids, or on Earth in the atmosphere or in the ground.
This contributes to the presence on Earth of cosmogenic nuclides.

On Earth new nuclei are also produced by radiogenesis, the decay of long-lived, primordial radionuclides such as uranium, thorium, and potassium-40.

==History==

===Timeline===
It is thought that the primordial nucleons themselves were formed from the quark–gluon plasma around 13.8 billion years ago during the Big Bang as it cooled below two trillion degrees. A few minutes afterwards, starting with only protons and neutrons, nuclei up to lithium and beryllium (both with mass number 7) were formed, but hardly any other elements. Some boron may have been formed at this time, but the process stopped before significant carbon could be formed, as this element requires a far higher product of helium density and time than were present in the short nucleosynthesis period of the Big Bang. That fusion process essentially shut down at about 20 minutes, due to drops in temperature and density as the universe continued to expand. This first process, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, was the first type of nucleogenesis to occur in the universe, creating the so-called primordial elements.

A star formed in the early universe produces heavier elements by combining its lighter nucleihydrogen, helium, lithium, beryllium, and boronwhich were found in the initial composition of the interstellar medium and hence the star. Interstellar gas therefore contains declining abundances of these light elements, which are present only by virtue of their nucleosynthesis during the Big Bang, and also cosmic ray spallation. These lighter elements in the present universe are therefore thought to have been produced through thousands of millions of years of cosmic ray (mostly high-energy proton) mediated breakup of heavier elements in interstellar gas and dust. The fragments of these cosmic-ray collisions include helium-3 and the stable isotopes of the light elements lithium, beryllium, and boron. Carbon was not made in the Big Bang, but was produced later in larger stars via the triple-alpha process.

The subsequent nucleosynthesis of heavier elements (&quot;Z&quot; ≥ 6, carbon and heavier elements) requires the extreme temperatures and pressures found within stars and supernovae. These processes began as hydrogen and helium from the Big Bang collapsed into the first stars after about 500 million years. Star formation has been occurring continuously in galaxies since that time. The primordial nuclides were created by Big Bang nucleosynthesis, stellar nucleosynthesis, supernova nucleosynthesis, and by nucleosynthesis in exotic events such as neutron star collisions. Other nuclides, such as Ar, formed later through radioactive decay. On Earth, mixing and evaporation has altered the primordial composition to what is called the natural terrestrial composition. The heavier elements produced after the Big Bang range in atomic numbers from &quot;Z&quot; = 6 (carbon) to &quot;Z&quot; = 94 (plutonium). Synthesis of these elements occurred through nuclear reactions involving the strong and weak interactions among nuclei, and called nuclear fusion (including both rapid and slow multiple neutron capture), and include also nuclear fission and radioactive decays such as beta decay. The stability of atomic nuclei of different sizes and composition (i.e. numbers of neutrons and protons) plays an important role in the possible reactions among nuclei. Cosmic nucleosynthesis, therefore, is studied among researchers of astrophysics and nuclear physics (&quot;nuclear astrophysics&quot;).

===History of nucleosynthesis theory===
The first ideas on nucleosynthesis were simply that the chemical elements were created at the beginning of the universe, but no rational physical scenario for this could be identified. Gradually it became clear that hydrogen and helium are much more abundant than any of the other elements. All the rest constitute less than 2% of the mass of the Solar System, and of other star systems as well. At the same time it was clear that oxygen and carbon were the next two most common elements, and also that there was a general trend toward high abundance of the light elements, especially those with isotopes composed of whole numbers of helium-4 nuclei (alpha nuclides).

Arthur Stanley Eddington first suggested in 1920 that stars obtain their energy by fusing hydrogen into helium and raised the possibility that the heavier elements may also form in stars. This idea was not generally accepted, as the nuclear mechanism was not understood. In the years immediately before World War II, Hans Bethe first elucidated those nuclear mechanisms by which hydrogen is fused into helium.

Fred Hoyle&#x27;s original work on nucleosynthesis of heavier elements in stars, occurred just after World War II. His work explained the production of all heavier elements, starting from hydrogen. Hoyle proposed that hydrogen is continuously created in the universe from vacuum and energy, without need for universal beginning.

Hoyle&#x27;s work explained how the abundances of the elements increased with time as the galaxy aged. Subsequently, Hoyle&#x27;s picture was expanded during the 1960s by contributions from William A. Fowler, Alastair G. W. Cameron, and Donald D. Clayton, followed by many others. The seminal 1957 review paper by E. M. Burbidge, G. R. Burbidge, Fowler and Hoyle is a well-known summary of the state of the field in 1957. That paper defined new processes for the transformation of one heavy nucleus into others within stars, processes that could be documented by astronomers.

The Big Bang itself had been proposed in 1931, long before this period, by Georges Lemaître, a Belgian physicist, who suggested that the evident expansion of the Universe in time required that the Universe, if contracted backwards in time, would continue to do so until it could contract no further. This would bring all the mass of the Universe to a single point, a &quot;primeval atom&quot;, to a state before which time and space did not exist. Hoyle is credited with coining the term &quot;Big Bang&quot; during a 1949 BBC radio broadcast, saying that Lemaître&#x27;s theory was &quot;based on the hypothesis that all the matter in the universe was created in one big bang at a particular time in the remote past.&quot; It is popularly reported that Hoyle intended this to be pejorative, but Hoyle explicitly denied this and said it was just a striking image meant to highlight the difference between the two models. Lemaître&#x27;s model was needed to explain the existence of deuterium and nuclides between helium and carbon, as well as the fundamentally high amount of helium present, not only in stars but also in interstellar space. As it happened, both Lemaître and Hoyle&#x27;s models of nucleosynthesis would be needed to explain the elemental abundances in the universe.

The goal of the theory of nucleosynthesis is to explain the vastly differing abundances of the chemical elements and their several isotopes from the perspective of natural processes. The primary stimulus to the development of this theory was the shape of a plot of the abundances versus the atomic number of the elements. Those abundances, when plotted on a graph as a function of atomic number, have a jagged sawtooth structure that varies by factors up to ten million. A very influential stimulus to nucleosynthesis research was an abundance table created by Hans Suess and Harold Urey that was based on the unfractionated abundances of the non-volatile elements found within unevolved meteorites. Such a graph of the abundances is displayed on a logarithmic scale below, where the dramatically jagged structure is visually suppressed by the many powers of ten spanned in the vertical scale of this graph.

==Processes==

There are a number of astrophysical processes which are believed to be responsible for nucleosynthesis. The majority of these occur within stars, and the chain of those nuclear fusion processes are known as hydrogen burning (via the proton–proton chain or the CNO cycle), helium burning, carbon burning, neon burning, oxygen burning and silicon burning. These processes are able to create elements up to and including iron and nickel. This is the region of nucleosynthesis within which the isotopes with the highest binding energy per nucleon are created. Heavier elements can be assembled within stars by a neutron capture process known as the s-process or in explosive environments, such as supernovae and neutron star mergers, by a number of other processes. Some of those others include the r-process, which involves rapid neutron captures, the rp-process, and the p-process (sometimes known as the gamma process), which results in the photodisintegration of existing nuclei.

==Major types==

===Big Bang nucleosynthesis===

Big Bang nucleosynthesis occurred within the first three minutes of the beginning of the universe and is responsible for much of the abundance of (protium), (D, deuterium), (helium-3), and (helium-4). Although continues to be produced by stellar fusion and alpha decays and trace amounts of continue to be produced by spallation and certain types of radioactive decay, most of the mass of the isotopes in the universe are thought to have been produced in the Big Bang. The nuclei of these elements, along with some and are considered to have been formed between 100 and 300 seconds after the Big Bang when the primordial quark–gluon plasma froze out to form protons and neutrons. Because of the very short period in which nucleosynthesis occurred before it was stopped by expansion and cooling (about 20 minutes), no elements heavier than beryllium (or possibly boron) could be formed. Elements formed during this time were in the plasma state, and did not cool to the state of neutral atoms until much later.

===Stellar nucleosynthesis===
Stellar nucleosynthesis is the nuclear process by which new nuclei are produced. It occurs in stars during stellar evolution. It is responsible for the galactic abundances of elements from carbon to iron. Stars are thermonuclear furnaces in which H and He are fused into heavier nuclei by increasingly high temperatures as the composition of the core evolves. Of particular importance is carbon because its formation from He is a bottleneck in the entire process. Carbon is produced by the triple-alpha process in all stars. Carbon is also the main element that causes the release of free neutrons within stars, giving rise to the s-process, in which the slow absorption of neutrons converts iron into elements heavier than iron and nickel.

The products of stellar nucleosynthesis are generally dispersed into the interstellar gas through mass loss episodes and the stellar winds of low mass stars. The mass loss events can be witnessed today in the planetary nebulae phase of low-mass star evolution, and the explosive ending of stars, called supernovae, of those with more than eight times the mass of the Sun.

The first direct proof that nucleosynthesis occurs in stars was the astronomical observation that interstellar gas has become enriched with heavy elements as time passed. As a result, stars that were born from it late in the galaxy, formed with much higher initial heavy element abundances than those that had formed earlier. The detection of technetium in the atmosphere of a red giant star in 1952, by spectroscopy, provided the first evidence of nuclear activity within stars. Because technetium is radioactive, with a half-life much less than the age of the star, its abundance must reflect its recent creation within that star. Equally convincing evidence of the stellar origin of heavy elements is the large overabundances of specific stable elements found in stellar atmospheres of asymptotic giant branch stars. Observation of barium abundances some 20–50 times greater than found in unevolved stars is evidence of the operation of the s-process within such stars. Many modern proofs of stellar nucleosynthesis are provided by the isotopic compositions of stardust, solid grains that have condensed from the gases of individual stars and which have been extracted from meteorites. Stardust is one component of cosmic dust and is frequently called presolar grains. The measured isotopic compositions in stardust grains demonstrate many aspects of nucleosynthesis within the stars from which the grains condensed during the star&#x27;s late-life mass-loss episodes.

===Explosive nucleosynthesis===

Supernova nucleosynthesis occurs in the energetic environment in supernovae, in which the elements between silicon and nickel are synthesized in quasiequilibrium established during fast fusion that attaches by reciprocating balanced nuclear reactions to 28Si. Quasiequilibrium can be thought of as &quot;almost equilibrium&quot; except for a high abundance of the 28Si nuclei in the feverishly burning mix. This concept was the most important discovery in nucleosynthesis theory of the intermediate-mass elements since Hoyle&#x27;s 1954 paper because it provided an overarching understanding of the abundant and chemically important elements between silicon (&quot;A&quot; = 28) and nickel (&quot;A&quot; = 60). It replaced the incorrect although much cited alpha process of the B2FH paper, which inadvertently obscured Hoyle&#x27;s 1954 theory. Further nucleosynthesis processes can occur, in particular the r-process (rapid process) described by the B2FH paper and first calculated by Seeger, Fowler and Clayton, in which the most neutron-rich isotopes of elements heavier than nickel are produced by rapid absorption of free neutrons. The creation of free neutrons by electron capture during the rapid compression of the supernova core along with the assembly of some neutron-rich seed nuclei makes the r-process a &quot;primary process&quot;, and one that can occur even in a star of pure H and He. This is in contrast to the B2FH designation of the process as a &quot;secondary process&quot;. This promising scenario, though generally supported by supernova experts, has yet to achieve a satisfactory calculation of r-process abundances. The primary r-process has been confirmed by astronomers who had observed old stars born when galactic metallicity was still small, that nonetheless contain their complement of r-process nuclei; thereby demonstrating that the metallicity is a product of an internal process. The r-process is responsible for our natural cohort of radioactive elements, such as uranium and thorium, as well as the most neutron-rich isotopes of each heavy element.

The rp-process (rapid proton) involves the rapid absorption of free protons as well as neutrons, but its role and its existence are less certain.

Explosive nucleosynthesis occurs too rapidly for radioactive decay to decrease the number of neutrons, so that many abundant isotopes with equal and even numbers of protons and neutrons are synthesized by the silicon quasi-equilibrium process. During this process, the burning of oxygen and silicon fuses nuclei that themselves have equal numbers of protons and neutrons to produce nuclides which consist of whole numbers of helium nuclei, up to 15 (representing 60Ni). Such multiple-alpha-particle nuclides are totally stable up to 40Ca (made of 10 helium nuclei), but heavier nuclei with equal and even numbers of protons and neutrons are tightly bound but unstable. The quasi-equilibrium produces radioactive isobars 44Ti, 48Cr, 52Fe, and 56Ni, which (except 44Ti) are created in abundance but decay after the explosion and leave the most stable isotope of the corresponding element at the same atomic weight. The most abundant and extant isotopes of elements produced in this way are 48Ti, 52Cr, and 56Fe. These decays are accompanied by the emission of gamma-rays (radiation from the nucleus), whose spectroscopic lines can be used to identify the isotope created by the decay. The detection of these emission lines were an important early product of gamma-ray astronomy.

The most convincing proof of explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae occurred in 1987 when those gamma-ray lines were detected emerging from supernova 1987A. Gamma-ray lines identifying 56Co and 57Co nuclei, whose half-lives limit their age to about a year, proved that their radioactive cobalt parents created them. This nuclear astronomy observation was predicted in 1969 as a way to confirm explosive nucleosynthesis of the elements, and that prediction played an important role in the planning for NASA&#x27;s Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory.

Other proofs of explosive nucleosynthesis are found within the stardust grains that condensed within the interiors of supernovae as they expanded and cooled. Stardust grains are one component of cosmic dust. In particular, radioactive 44Ti was measured to be very abundant within supernova stardust grains at the time they condensed during the supernova expansion. This confirmed a 1975 prediction of the identification of supernova stardust (SUNOCONs), which became part of the pantheon of presolar grains. Other unusual isotopic ratios within these grains reveal many specific aspects of explosive nucleosynthesis.

===Neutron star mergers===
The merger of binary neutron stars (BNSs) is now believed to be the main source of r-process elements. Being neutron-rich by definition, mergers of this type had been suspected of being a source of such elements, but definitive evidence was difficult to obtain. In 2017 strong evidence emerged, when LIGO, VIRGO, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and INTEGRAL, along with a collaboration of many observatories around the world, detected both gravitational wave and electromagnetic signatures of a likely neutron star merger, GW170817, and subsequently detected signals of numerous heavy elements such as gold as the ejected degenerate matter decays and cools. The first detection of the merger of a neutron star and black hole (NSBHs) came in July 2021 and more after but analysis seem to favor BNSs over NSBHs as the main contributors to heavy metal production.

===Black hole accretion disk nucleosynthesis===
Nucleosynthesis may happen in accretion disks of black holes.

===Cosmic ray spallation===

Cosmic ray spallation process reduces the atomic weight of interstellar matter by the impact with cosmic rays, to produce some of the lightest elements present in the universe (though not a significant amount of deuterium). Most notably spallation is believed to be responsible for the generation of almost all of 3He and the elements lithium, beryllium, and boron, although some and are thought to have been produced in the Big Bang. The spallation process results from the impact of cosmic rays (mostly fast protons) against the interstellar medium. These impacts fragment carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen nuclei present. The process results in the light elements beryllium, boron, and lithium in the cosmos at much greater abundances than they are found within solar atmospheres. The quantities of the light elements 1H and 4He produced by spallation are negligible relative to their primordial abundance.

Beryllium and boron are not significantly produced by stellar fusion processes, since 8Be has an extremely short half-life of seconds.

==Empirical evidence==

Theories of nucleosynthesis are tested by calculating isotope abundances and comparing those results with observed abundances. Isotope abundances are typically calculated from the transition rates between isotopes in a network. Often these calculations can be simplified as a few key reactions control the rate of other reactions.

==Minor mechanisms and processes==

Tiny amounts of certain nuclides are produced on Earth by artificial means. Those are our primary source, for example, of technetium. However, some nuclides are also produced by a number of natural means that have continued after primordial elements were in place. These often act to create new elements in ways that can be used to date rocks or to trace the source of geological processes. Although these processes do not produce the nuclides in abundance, they are assumed to be the entire source of the existing natural supply of those nuclides.

These mechanisms include:
* Radioactive decay may lead to radiogenic daughter nuclides. The nuclear decay of many long-lived primordial isotopes, especially uranium-235, uranium-238, and thorium-232 produce many intermediate daughter nuclides before they too finally decay to isotopes of lead. The Earth&#x27;s natural supply of elements like radon and polonium is via this mechanism. The atmosphere&#x27;s supply of argon-40 is due mostly to the radioactive decay of potassium-40 in the time since the formation of the Earth. Little of the atmospheric argon is primordial. Helium-4 is produced by alpha-decay, and the helium trapped in Earth&#x27;s crust is also mostly non-primordial. In other types of radioactive decay, such as cluster decay, larger species of nuclei are ejected (for example, neon-20), and these eventually become newly formed stable atoms.
* Radioactive decay may lead to spontaneous fission. This is not cluster decay, as the fission products may be split among nearly any type of atom. Thorium-232, uranium-235, and uranium-238 are primordial isotopes that undergo spontaneous fission. Natural technetium and promethium are produced in this manner.
* Nuclear reactions. Naturally occurring nuclear reactions powered by radioactive decay give rise to so-called nucleogenic nuclides. This process happens when an energetic particle from radioactive decay, often an alpha particle, reacts with a nucleus of another atom to change the nucleus into another nuclide. This process may also cause the production of further subatomic particles, such as neutrons. Neutrons can also be produced in spontaneous fission and by neutron emission. These neutrons can then go on to produce other nuclides via neutron-induced fission, or by neutron capture. For example, some stable isotopes such as neon-21 and neon-22 are produced by several routes of nucleogenic synthesis, and thus only part of their abundance is primordial.
* Nuclear reactions due to cosmic rays. By convention, these reaction-products are not termed &quot;nucleogenic&quot; nuclides, but rather cosmogenic nuclides. Cosmic rays continue to produce new elements on Earth by the same cosmogenic processes discussed above that produce primordial beryllium and boron. One important example is carbon-14, produced from nitrogen-14 in the atmosphere by cosmic rays. Iodine-129 is another example.

<text>The People&#x27;s Bank of China (officially PBC and unofficially PBOC) is the central bank of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is responsible for carrying out monetary policy as determined by the People&#x27;s Bank Law and the Commercial Bank Law.

The PBC was established in 1948 and became China&#x27;s sole central bank after the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949. From 1969 to 1978, the PBC was demoted to a bureau of the Ministry of Finance. The PBC was extensively reformed during the 1990s, when its provincial and local branches were abolished, instead opening nine regional branches. In 2023, these reforms were reversed as when the regional branches were abolished and the provincial branches restored, and new arrangements essentially ended the PBC&#x27;s longstanding role in financial supervision.

The PBC is the 25th-ranked of 26 ministerial-level departments of the State Council. The PBC lacks central bank independence and is required to implement the policies of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) under the direction of the party&#x27;s Central Financial Commission. The PBC is led by a governor assisted by several deputy governors and a CCP Committee Secretary. Since 2023, the roles of governor and CCP Committee Secretary have been held jointly by Pan Gongsheng.

== History ==

===Mao era===
The bank was established on December 1, 1948, based on the consolidation of the Huabei Bank, the Beihai Bank and Northwestern Farmers&#x27; Bank. The headquarters was first located in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, and then moved to Beijing in 1949. Between 1950 and 1978 the PBC was the only bank in the People&#x27;s Republic of China and was responsible for both central banking and commercial banking operations. All other banks within mainland China such as the Bank of China were either organized as divisions of the PBC or were non-deposit taking agencies.

From 1952 to 1955 government shares were added to private banks to make state-private banks, until under the first Five Year plan from 1955 to 1959 the PBC had complete control of the private banks, making them branches of the PBC, closely resembling the vision of Vladimir Lenin. With aid from the Soviet Union, the shares of private enterprises and with them industrial output followed a similar path, forming a Soviet-style planned economy.

During the Cultural Revolution, the PBC suspended its commercial banking service. In June 1969, the State Council approved the consolidation of PBC&#x27;s headquarters as a bureau within the Ministry of Finance. In that context, the PBC&#x27;s head office was downsized to no more than eighty staff. Local PBC branches were correspondingly merged into local government finance departments.

===Early reform era===
The institutional demotion of the PBC was reversed in March 1978 as it was separated from the Finance Ministry and granted ministerial ranking.

By then and with the exception of special allocations for rural development, the monolithic PBC dominated all business transactions and credit. In 1979, China initiated a transition from that single-tier banking system to a two-tier system, which was largely completed by 1984. In March 1979, as part of the Chinese economic reforms, the State Council split off state-owned banks from the PBC, first the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) and the Bank of China (BOC). The People&#x27;s Construction Bank of China, which had been run separately under the Ministry of Finance, was also made autonomous (and later renamed China Construction Bank in 1986). In January 1984, the PBC&#x27;s own commercial banking operations were spun off as the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). In September 1983, the State Council had promulgated that the PBC would function exclusively as the central bank of China and no longer undertake commercial banking activities.

Modernization efforts continued in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1990, the PBC moved into its new head office building, prominently located on West Chang&#x27;an Avenue. In 1991, Vice Governor Chen Yuan spearheaded the creation of the Electronic Interbank System (EIS), the PBC&#x27;s first state-of-the-art financial market infrastructure. In 1992, however, the PBC had to reluctantly concede the spinning off of its securities regulatory duties to the newly established China Securities Regulatory Commission, whose first chair was former PBC vice governor Liu Hongru.

The bank&#x27;s profile was greatly raised by the appointment of Zhu Rongji as its governor in 1993, simultaneously as his role as Vice Premier in charge of economic and financial affairs.. Its central bank status was legally confirmed on March 18, 1995, by the 3rd Plenum of the 8th National People&#x27;s Congress, and was granted a higher degree of autonomy than other State Council ministries by an act that year. In 1996 and 1996, the PBC established fundamental regulations on loans and consumer credit.

In 1998, the PBC underwent a major restructuring. All provincial and local branches were abolished, and the PBC opened nine regional branches, whose boundaries did not correspond to local administrative boundaries. The nine branches were located in Chengdu, Guangzhou, Jinan, Nanjing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Tianjin, Wuhan, and Xi&#x27;an, complemented by a sub-provincial network of city-level and county-level sub-branches. That same year, the so-called credit plan, a key feature of China&#x27;s former state planning process, was finally abandoned, allowing the PBC to play a genuine role as monetary policy authority.

===21st century===
In 2003, the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress approved an amendment law for strengthening the role of PBC in the making and implementation of monetary policy for safeguarding the overall financial stability and provision of financial services. That year, the long overdue restructuring of China&#x27;s banking sector made major progress with the creation of Central Huijin Investment, a PBC-managed fund that allowed the PBC to take the lead from the Ministry of Finance on the restructuring process and from the CCP Central Organization Department on the appointment of senior bank executives. That same year, however, the PBC reluctantly lost its direct authority over banking supervision with the creation of the China Banking Regulatory Commission.

In 2005, the PBC elevated its branch in Shanghai to the status of &quot;second head office&quot;, in a move intended to mirror the prominent market-facing role of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York within the US Federal Reserve System. In 2006, the PBC established the Credit Reference Centre to provide financial credit reporting. In 2008, the PBC lost the direct ownership stakes it had built up in much of China&#x27;s financial sector as the ownership of Central Huijin was transferred to the China Investment Corporation (CIC), a newly created sovereign wealth fund.

During the Great Recession, the PBC helped address bank liquidity crisis by signing swap agreements with numerous other countries to provide them with liquidity based on the renminbi. , China has swap agreements with 40 countries.

In 2010, the PBC issued administrative measures regarding online non-financial payment services. These measures retroactively recognized the legal status of online third-party payment platforms like Alipay. Prior to the 2010 measures, these services existed in a legal grey area.

In 2015, the PBC hosted China&#x27;s first formal deposit insurance scheme. In 2019, this scheme was reorganized as a subsidiary of the PBC, the Deposit Insurance Fund Management Company. Meanwhile, in 2017, the PBC was tasked with the secretariat of China&#x27;s newly established Financial Stability and Development Committee chaired by Vice Premier Liu He. In 2020, the PBC initiated supervision of significant financial holding companies.

The PBC underwent through another major restructuring in 2023, with the abolition of the nine regional branches established in 1998, which had already seen their authority watered down by a change in 2004 that had returned authority to the PBC&#x27;s branches at the provincial level and further changes in 2018. Additionally, the PBC&#x27;s county-level branches were absorbed by city-level branches. The new branches were inaugurated on August 18, 2023. The oversight over financial holding companies and financial consumer protection was also transferred from the PBC to the newly established National Financial Regulatory Administration (NFRA). Around 1,600 county-level branches of the PBC are planned to be absorbed to the NFRA; the PBC had 1,761 such branches at the end of 2021.

==Operations==
The PBC is a cabinet-level executive department of the State Council. The top management of the PBC are composed of the governor and a certain number of deputy governors. The governor is nominated by the premier of the State Council, who is then approved by the National People&#x27;s Congress or its Standing Committee and appointed by the president.The deputy governors of the PBC are appointed to or removed from office by the premier.

The PBC adopts the governor responsibility system under which the governor supervises the overall work of the PBC while the deputy governors provide assistance to the governor to fulfill his or her responsibility. The current governor is Pan Gongsheng. Deputy governors of the management team include: Zhu Hexin, Zhang Qingsong, Xuan Changneng, Lu Lei, and Tao Ling.

The PBC does not have central bank independence and is required to implement the policies of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It operates under the direction of the CCP&#x27;s Central Financial Commission. The CCP committee secretary of the PBC is the most powerful position in the bank and can hold more sway than the governor. The current CCP committee secretary is Pan Gongsheng.

The PBC Monetary Policy Committee is an advisory body chaired by the PBC governor. It typically includes the directors and deputy directors of other financial agencies, as well as a few influential academic economists.

===Central departments===

The head office building of the PBC, on West Chang&#x27;an Avenue, was constructed in 1987–1990 on a design by a team of architects led by Zhou Ru. While its materials are modern, its shape refers to two traditional Chinese motifs, namely yuanbao ingots and &quot;wealth vases&quot; () from Chinese folklore.

<text>The rules of chess (also known as the laws of chess) govern the play of the game of chess. Chess is a two-player abstract strategy board game. Each player controls sixteen pieces of six types on a chessboard. Each type of piece moves in a distinct way. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent&#x27;s king; checkmate occurs when a king is threatened with capture and has no escape. A game can end in various ways besides checkmate: a player can resign, and there are several ways a game can end in a draw.

While the exact origins of chess are unclear, modern rules first took form during the Middle Ages. The rules continued to be slightly modified until the early 19th century, when they reached essentially their current form. The rules also varied somewhat from region to region. Today, the standard rules are set by FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs), the international governing body for chess. Slight modifications are made by some national organizations for their own purposes. There are variations of the rules for fast chess, correspondence chess, online chess, and Chess960.

Besides the basic moves of the pieces, rules also govern the equipment used, time control, conduct and ethics of players, accommodations for physically challenged players, and recording of moves using chess notation. Procedures for resolving irregularities that can occur during a game are provided as well.

==Initial setup==
Chess is played on a chessboard, a square board divided into a grid of 64 squares (eight-by-eight) of alternating color (similar to the board used in draughts). Regardless of the actual colors of the board, the lighter-colored squares are called &quot;light&quot; or &quot;white&quot;, and the darker-colored squares are called &quot;dark&quot; or &quot;black&quot;. Sixteen &quot;white&quot; and sixteen &quot;black&quot; pieces are placed on the board at the beginning of the game. The board is placed so that a white square is in each player&#x27;s near-right corner. Horizontal rows are called &#x27;, and vertical columns are called &#x27;.

Each player controls sixteen pieces:
At the beginning of the game, the pieces are arranged as shown in the diagram: for each side one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. The pieces are placed, one per square, as follows:
* Rooks are placed on the outside corners, right and left edge.
* Knights are placed immediately inside of the rooks.
* Bishops are placed immediately inside of the knights.
* The queen is placed on the central square of the same color of that of the piece: white queen on the white square and black queen on the black square.
* The king takes the vacant spot next to the queen.
* Pawns are placed one square in front of all of the other pieces.
Popular mnemonics used to remember the setup are &quot;queen on her own color&quot; and &quot;white on right&quot;. The latter refers to setting up the board so that the square closest to each player&#x27;s right is white.
==Gameplay==

The player controlling the white pieces is named &quot;White&quot;; the player controlling the black pieces is named &quot;Black&quot;. White moves first, then players alternate moves. Making a move is required; it is not legal to skip a move, even when having to move is detrimental. Play continues until a king is checkmated, a player resigns, or a draw is declared, as explained below. In addition, if the game is being played under a time control, a player who exceeds the time limit loses the game unless they cannot be checkmated.

The official chess rules do not include a procedure for determining who plays White. Instead, this decision is left open to tournament-specific rules (e.g. a Swiss system tournament or round-robin tournament) or, in the case of casual play, mutual agreement, in which case some kind of random choice such as flipping a coin can be employed. A common method is for one player to conceal a pawn of each color in either hand; the other player chooses a hand to open and receives the color of the piece that is revealed.

===Movement===

====Basic moves====




 

Each type of chess piece has its own method of movement. A piece moves to a vacant square except when an opponent&#x27;s piece.

Except for any move of the knight and castling, pieces cannot jump over other pieces. A piece is &quot;captured&quot; (or &quot;taken&quot;) when an attacking enemy piece replaces it on its square. The captured piece is thereby permanently removed from the game. The king can be put in check but cannot be captured (see below).
* The king moves exactly one square adjacent to it. A special move with the king known as &quot;castling&quot; is allowed only once per player, per game (see below).
* A rook moves any number of vacant squares horizontally or vertically. It also is moved when castling.
* A bishop moves any number of vacant squares diagonally. (Thus a bishop can move to only light or dark squares, not both.)
* The queen moves any number of vacant squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
* A knight moves to one of the nearest squares not on the same , , or . (This can be thought of as moving two squares horizontally then one square vertically, or moving one square horizontally then two squares vertically—i.e. in an &quot;L&quot; pattern.) The knight is not blocked by other pieces; it jumps to the new location.
* Pawns have the most complex rules of movement:
:* A pawn moves straight forward one square, if that square is vacant. If it has not yet moved, a pawn also has the option of moving squares straight forward, provided both squares are vacant. Pawns cannot move backwards.
:* A pawn, unlike other pieces, captures differently from how it moves. A pawn can capture an enemy piece on either of the two squares diagonally in front of the pawn. It cannot move to those squares when vacant except when capturing &quot;en passant&quot;.
: The pawn is also involved in the two special moves &quot;en passant&quot; and promotion.
====Castling====



Castling consists of moving the king two squares towards a rook, then placing the rook on the other side of the king, adjacent to it. Castling is only permissible if all of the following conditions hold:
* The king and rook involved in castling must not have previously moved;
* There must be no pieces between the king and the rook;
* The king may not currently be under attack, nor may the king pass through or end up in a square that is under attack by an enemy piece (though the rook is permitted to be under attack and to pass over an attacked square);
* The castling rook must be on the same rank as the king
An unmoved king and an unmoved rook of the same color on the same rank are said to have &quot;castling rights&quot;.

====&quot;En passant&quot;====
When a pawn advances two squares on its initial move and ends the turn adjacent to an enemy pawn on the same , it may be captured &quot;en passant&quot; by the enemy pawn as if it had moved only one square. This capture is legal only on the move immediately following the pawn&#x27;s advance. The diagrams demonstrate an instance of this: if the white pawn moves from a2 to a4, the black pawn on b4 can capture it &quot;en passant&quot;, moving from b4 to a3, and the white pawn on a4 is removed from the board.
====Promotion====
If a player advances a pawn to its eighth rank, the pawn is then &quot;promoted&quot; (converted) to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color at the choice of the player (a queen is most common). The choice is not limited to previously pieces. Hence it is theoretically possible for a player to have up to nine queens or up to ten rooks, bishops, or knights if all of the player&#x27;s pawns are promoted.

===Check===
A king is &quot;in check&quot; when it is under attack by at least one enemy piece. A piece unable to move because it would place its own king in check (it is pinned against its own king) may still deliver check to the opposing player.

It is illegal to make a move that places or leaves one&#x27;s king in check. The possible ways to get out of check are:
* the king to a square where it is not in check.
* the checking piece.
* a piece between the king and the opponent&#x27;s threatening piece ( the check).

In informal games, it is customary to announce &quot;check&quot; when making a move that puts the opponent&#x27;s king in check. In formal competitions, however, check is rarely announced.

===End of the game===

==== Checkmate ====

If a player&#x27;s king is placed in check and there is no legal move that player can make to escape check, then the king is said to be &quot;checkmated&quot;, the game ends, and that player loses. Unlike the other pieces, the king is never captured.

The diagram shows an example checkmate position. The white king is threatened by the black queen; the empty square to which the king could move is also threatened; and the king cannot capture the queen, because it would then be in check by the rook.
====Resigning====
Either player may &quot;resign&quot; at any time, conceding the game to the opponent. To indicate resignation, the player may say &quot;I resign&quot;. Tipping over the king also indicates resignation, but it should be distinguished from accidentally knocking the king over. Stopping both clocks is not an indication of resigning, since clocks can be stopped to call the arbiter. An offer of a handshake is sometimes used, but it could be mistaken for a draw offer.

Under FIDE Laws, a resignation by one player results in a draw if their opponent has no way to checkmate them via any series of legal moves, or a loss by that player otherwise.
==== Draws ====

The game ends in a draw if any of these conditions occur:
* The player to move is not in check and has no legal move. This situation is called a stalemate. An example of such a position is shown in the adjacent diagram.
* The game reaches a dead position.
* Both players agree to a draw after one of the players makes such an offer.

In addition, in the FIDE rules, if a player has run out of time (see below), or has resigned, but the position is such that there is no way for the opponent to give checkmate by any series of legal moves, the game is a draw.

FIDE&#x27;s competitive rules of play allow a player to claim a draw in either of two situations:
* Fifty moves have been made by each player without a capture or pawn movement (this is the fifty-move rule);
* The same position has appeared three times (or has appeared twice and the player claiming the draw can force the third appearance); this is the threefold repetition rule.
These rules help prevent games from being extended indefinitely in tournaments.

There is no longer a rule specifically defining perpetual check as a draw. In such a situation, either the threefold repetition rule or the fifty-move rule will eventually come into effect. More often, the players will simply agree to a draw.

===== Dead position =====

A &quot;dead position&quot; is defined as a position where neither player can checkmate their opponent&#x27;s king by any sequence of legal moves. According to the rules of chess the game is immediately terminated the moment a dead position appears on the board. 

Some basic endings are always dead positions; for example:
* king against king;
* king against king and bishop;
* king against king and knight.

Blocked positions can arise in which progress is impossible for either side, such as the diagrammed position; these too are dead positions.

USCF rules, for games played under a time control that does not include delay or increment, allow draw claims for &quot;insufficient losing chances&quot;. For example, if each player has only a king and a knight, checkmate is only achievable with the co-operation of both players, even if it is not a dead position.

=== Touch-move rule ===

The touch-move rule is a fundamental principle in chess, ensuring that players commit to moves deliberated mentally, without physically experimenting on the board. According to this rule, a player who touches a piece with the intention of moving it must then move it if legally possible. This rule also applies to capturing: a player who touches an opponent&#x27;s piece must capture it if a legal capture is available. Special considerations apply for castling and pawn promotion, reflecting their unique nature in the game.

A player who touches a piece to adjust its physical position within a square must first alert the opponent by saying &quot;J&#x27;adoube&quot; or &quot;I adjust&quot;. Once the game has started, only the player with the move may touch the pieces on the board.

==Competitive rules of play==
The following rules are applicable to games in organized tournaments and matches, sanctioned by FIDE. They mention timing (chess clocks), arbiters (or, in USCF play, directors), keeping score, and adjournment. The FIDE Laws of Chess define the rules for standard chess, rapid chess, blitz chess, and guidelines for Chess960. For standard chess, the players must record the moves, which is optional in rapid chess and blitz Chess. Some rules are specifically adapted for blind and visually impaired players.

These rules are used for (OTB) games. The rules for correspondence chess are defined by the ICCF. Rules for computer chess and for online chess played on a computer device are published by other organizers and governing bodies.

===Moving the pieces===
Although the touch-move rule is generally observed even in non-organized, non-sanctioned play, the interpretation of that rule to special situations such as capturing, castling, and promotion is not obvious; thus it is elaborated further in FIDE rules.

The movement of pieces is to be done with one hand. Once the hand is taken off a piece after moving it, the move cannot be retracted unless the . As for the touch-move rule, an arbiter who observes a violation of this rule must intervene immediately.

When castling, a player should first move the king with one hand and then move the rook with the same hand. In the case of a promotion, if a player releases the pawn on the eighth rank, the player must promote the pawn. After the pawn has moved, the player may touch any piece not on the board and the promotion is not finalized until the new piece is released on the promotion square. Although it is a common practice in informal play, under FIDE rules an upturned rook may not be used to represent a promoted queen; such a move would be treated as a legal rook promotion. If the correct piece is not immediately available, the player may stop the clocks and call the arbiter.

=== Timing ===

Tournament games are played under time constraints, called time controls, using a chess clock. Each player is timed separately and must make moves within the time control or forfeit the game. There are different types of time controls applied. For standard chess, different periods can be defined with different fixed times (e.g. first 40 moves in 100 minutes, next 20 moves in 50 minutes, remaining moves in 15 minutes). For rapid and blitz chess, only one period can be defined where all moves must be performed. Additionally, an increment or delay per move may be defined.
* When a player runs out of time, this event is called . A flag-fall has no consequences unless stated as observed by the arbiter, in which case the arbiter must intervene, or claimed by a player.
* When no flag-fall is stated, and one of the following events occur, the result of the game still holds. It is of no relevance if the player runs out of time afterwards, or has already run out of time, but this was not stated: 
** If a player delivers a checkmate, the game is over and that player wins.
** If a move results in a stalemate, dead position, fivefold repetition or the seventy-five-move rule applies, the game is over and the game is drawn.
* If a player correctly claims flag-fall, that player wins. But if the claiming player is out of time, or could not still theoretically checkmate the opponent, the game is a draw.

The United States Chess Federation (USCF) rule is different. USCF Rule 14E defines &quot;insufficient material to win on time&quot;, that is lone king, king plus knight, king plus bishop, and king plus two knights opposed by no pawns, and there is no forced win in the final position. Hence to win on time with this material, the USCF rule requires that a win can be forced from that position, while the FIDE rule merely requires a win to be possible. (See Monika Soćko rules appeal in 2008 and Women&#x27;s World Chess Championship 2008 for a famous instance of this rule.)

With mechanical clocks only, flag-fall for both players can occur. With digital clocks, the clock indicates which flag fell first, and this information is valid.

In the last period of a standard chess game or rapid games, if played without increment, a special set of rules applies regarding the clock, referenced as &quot;Quickplay Finishes&quot;. These rules allow a player with under two minutes time to request an increment introduced, or request a draw based on claiming no progress or no effort, to be ruled by the arbiter. These rules have been relevant when playing with mechanical clocks, which do not allow setting an increment and are today with digital clocks of second importance only, as playing with increment is recommended.

===Recording moves===


Each square of the chessboard is identified with a unique pair of a letter and a number. The vertical are labeled through , from White&#x27;s left (i.e. the queenside) to White&#x27;s right. Similarly, the horizontal are numbered from to , starting from the one nearest White&#x27;s side of the board. Each square of the board, then, is uniquely identified by its file letter and rank number. The white king, for example, starts the game on square e1. The black knight on b8 can move to a6 or c6.

In formal competition, each player is obliged to record each move as it is played in algebraic chess notation in order to settle disputes about illegal positions, overstepping time control, and making claims of draws by the fifty-move rule or repetition of position. Moves recorded in any other systems of notation cannot be used in evidence in such a dispute. Other chess notation systems include ICCF numeric notation for international correspondence chess and descriptive chess notation, formerly standard in English speaking countries. The current rule is that a move must be made on the board before it is written on paper or recorded with an electronic device.

Both players should indicate offers of a draw by writing &quot;=&quot; at that move on their score sheets. Notations about the time on the clocks can be made. A player with less than five minutes left to complete all the remaining moves is not required to record the moves (unless a delay of at least thirty seconds per move is being used). The score sheet must be made available to the at all times. A player may respond to an opponent&#x27;s move before writing it down.
===Adjournment===

Formerly common, adjournments are no longer standard practice in chess competition.

When an adjournment is made, the player whose move it is writes their next move on their scoresheet but does not make the move on the chessboard. This is referred to as a . Both opponents&#x27; scoresheets are then placed in the sealed-move envelope and the envelope is sealed. The names of the players, the colors, the position, the time on the clocks and other game data are recorded on the envelope; the envelope may also be signed by both players. The arbiter then keeps possession of the envelope until it is time to restart the game, at which time the arbiter opens the envelope, makes the sealed move on the board, and starts the opponent&#x27;s clock.

===Irregularities===

====Illegal move====
An illegal move is a move not made according to a piece&#x27;s possible defined movements or made according to its possible movements but such that its own king is left or placed in check. Furthermore, pressing the clock without making a move or making a move with two hands is considered and penalized as an illegal move.

A player who makes an must retract that move and make a legal move. That move must be made with the same piece if possible, because the touch-move rule applies. If the illegal move was an attempt to castle, the touch-move rule applies to the king but not to the rook. If the mistake is noticed, the game should be restarted from the position in which the error occurred. The arbiter should adjust the time on the clock according to the best evidence. Some regional organizations have different rules.

A player may correct an illegal move if the player has not pressed the clock. In standard chess, if a move is found during the game, the position immediately before the irregularity is reinstated. In the most used form of rapid chess and blitz chess if the move is found before the opponent moves, the position immediately before the irregularity is also reinstated.

According to the FIDE Laws of Chess, the first stated completed illegal move results in a time penalty. The time penalty consists of giving the opponent two minutes extra time in standard chess, or one minute extra time in rapid or blitz. The second stated completed illegal move by the same player results in the loss of the game, unless the position is such that it is impossible for the opponent to win by any series of legal moves (e.g. if the opponent has a bare king) in which case the game is drawn. A move is completed when it has been made and the player has pressed the clock.

Under USCF rules, if a player completes an illegal move in blitz chess, the player&#x27;s opponent may claim a win before making a move (if the opponent has enough material to win). One way to claim this win is to take a King left in check by the opponent. Once the illegal move has been answered, the move stands.

====Incorrect setup====
For standard chess and the most used form of rapid and blitz chess there are the following rules. If it is discovered during the game that the starting position was incorrect, the game is restarted. If it is discovered during the game that the board is oriented incorrectly, the game is continued with the pieces transferred to a correctly oriented board. If the game starts with colors reversed, the game is restarted if less than 10 moves have been made by both players, otherwise the game is continued. If the clock setting is found to be incorrect during the game, it is corrected according to best judgement. Some regional organizations have different rules.

====Piece displacement====
If a player knocks over pieces, it is the same player&#x27;s responsibility to restore them to their correct positions, on that player&#x27;s time. If it is discovered that an illegal move has been made, or that pieces have been displaced, the game is restored to the position before the irregularity. If that position cannot be determined, the game is restored to the last known correct position.

====Illegal position====
An illegal position is a position which cannot be reached by any series of legal moves.

===Conduct===
Players may not use any notes, outside sources of information (including computers), or advice from other people. Analysis on another board is not permitted. Scoresheets are to record objective facts about the game only, such as time on the clock or draw offers. Players may not leave the competition area without permission of the arbiter.

High standards of etiquette and ethics are expected. Players should shake hands before and after the game. Generally a player should not speak during the game, except to offer a draw, resign, or to call attention to an irregularity. An announcement of &quot;check&quot; is commonly made in informal games but is not recommended in officially sanctioned games. A player may not distract or annoy another player by any means, including repeatedly offering a draw.

Due to increasing concerns about the use of chess engines and outside communication, mobile phone usage is banned. The first forfeit by a high-profile player, for phone ringing during play, occurred in 2003. In 2014 FIDE extended this to ban all mobile phones from the playing area during chess competitions, under penalty of forfeiture of the game or even expulsion from the tournament. The rules allow for less rigid enforcement in minor events.

==Equipment==
Pieces of the Staunton chess set design are the standard and are usually made of wood or plastic. They are often black and white; other colors may be used (like a dark wood or even red for the dark pieces) but they would still be called the &quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot; pieces (see White and Black in chess). The height of the king should be about 95 mm, within 10 percent. The diameter of the king should be 40 to 50% of its height. The size of the other pieces should be in proportion to the king. The pieces should be well balanced.

The size of the squares of the chessboard should be approximately 1.25 to 1.3 times the diameter of the base of the king, or 50 to 65 mm. Squares of approximately 57 mm ( inches) normally are well-suited for pieces with the kings in the preferred size range; four pawns should fit on a square. Squares may be the natural color of the wood, or other combinations of dark and light colors.

In games subject to time control, a chess clock is used, consisting of two adjacent clocks and buttons to stop one clock while starting the other, such that the two component clocks never run simultaneously. The clock can be analog or digital though a digital clock is preferred under both USCF and FIDE rulesets. This is because most tournaments now include either an increment (extra time being added prior or after the move) or delay (a countdown to when a clock starts again) to their time controls. Before the start of the game, in FIDE competitions the arbiter decides where the chess clock is placed; in USCF competitions the director may decide, or the director may leave it to the players, in which case the player with the black pieces will decide.

==History==
The rules of chess have evolved much over the centuries from the early chess-like games played in India in the 6th century. For much of that time the rules have varied from area to area. The modern rules first took form in southern Europe during the 13th century, giving more mobility to pieces that previously had more restricted movement (such as the queen and bishop). Such modified rules entered into an accepted form during the late 15th century or early 16th century. The basic moves of the king, rook, and knight are unchanged. A pawn originally did not have the option of moving two squares on its first move, and promoted only to a queen upon reaching the eighth rank. The queen was originally the &quot;fers&quot; or &quot;farzin&quot;, which could move one square diagonally in any direction. In European chess it became able to leap two squares diagonally, forwards, backwards, or to left or right on its first move; some areas also gave this right to a newly promoted pawn. In the Persian and Arabic game the bishop was a &quot;pīl&quot; (Persian) or &quot;fīl&quot; (Arabic) (meaning &quot;elephant&quot;) which moved two squares diagonally with jump. In the Middle Ages the pawn could only be promoted to the equivalent of a queen (which at that time was a weak piece) if it reached its eighth rank. During the 12th century, the squares on the board sometimes alternated colors, and this became the standard in the 13th century; whence the word &quot;chequered&quot;/&quot;checkered&quot;.

Between 1200 and 1600 several laws emerged that drastically altered the game. Checkmate became a requirement to win; a player could not win by capturing all of the opponent&#x27;s pieces. Stalemate was added, although the outcome has changed several times (see History of the stalemate rule). Pawns gained the option of moving two squares on their first move, and the &quot;en passant&quot; rule was a natural consequence of that new option. The king and rook acquired the right to castle (see for different versions of the rule).

Between 1475 and 1500, the queen and the bishop also acquired their current moves, which made them much stronger pieces. When all of these changes were accepted, the game was in essentially its modern form.

The rules for promotion have changed several times. As stated above, originally the pawn could only be promoted to the queen, which at that time was a weak piece. When the queen acquired its current move and became the most powerful piece, the pawn could then be promoted to a queen or a rook, bishop, or knight. In the 18th century rules allowed only the promotion to a piece already captured, e.g. the rules published in 1749 by François-André Danican Philidor. In the 19th century, this restriction was lifted, which allowed for a player to have more than one queen, e.g. the 1828 rules by Jacob Sarratt.

Two new rules concerning draws were introduced, each of which has changed through the years:
* The threefold repetition rule was added, although at some times up to six repetitions have been required, and the exact conditions have been specified more clearly (see ).
* The fifty-move rule was also added. At various times, the number of moves required was different, such as 24, 60, 70, or 75. For several years in the 20th century, the standard fifty moves was extended to one hundred moves for a few specific endgames (see Fifty-move rule&#x27;s history).

Another group of new laws included (1) the touch-move rule and the accompanying &quot;j&#x27;adoube/adjust&quot; rule; (2) that White moves first (in 1889); (3) the orientation of the board; (4) the procedure if an illegal move was made; (5) the procedure if the king had been left in check for some moves; and (6) issues regarding the behavior of players and spectators. The Staunton chess set was introduced in 1849 and it became the standard style of pieces. The size of pieces and squares of the board was standardized.

Until the middle of the 19th century, chess games were played without any time limit. In an 1834 match between Alexander McDonnell and Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais, McDonnell took an inordinate amount of time to move, sometimes up to 1½ hours. In 1836 Pierre Charles Fournier de Saint-Amant suggested a time limit, but no action was taken. At the 1851 London tournament, Staunton blamed his loss in his match against Elijah Williams on Williams&#x27; slow play; one game was adjourned for the day after only 29 moves. The next year a match between Daniel Harrwitz and Johann Löwenthal used a limit of 20 minutes per move. The first use of a modern-style time limit was in an 1861 match between Adolph Anderssen and Ignác Kolisch.

===Codification===

The first known publication of chess rules was in a book by Luis Ramírez de Lucena about 1497, shortly after the movement of the queen, bishop, and pawn were changed to their modern form. Ruy López de Segura gave rules of chess in his 1561 book Libro de la invencion liberal y arte del juego del axedrez. In the 16th and 17th centuries, there were local differences concerning rules such as castling, promotion, stalemate, and &quot;en passant&quot;. Some of these differences persisted until the 19th century; for example, differences in castling rules persisted in Italy until the late 19th century.

As chess clubs arose and tournaments became common, there was a need to formalize the rules. In 1749 Philidor (1726–1795) wrote a set of rules that were widely used, as well as rules by later writers such as the 1828 rules by Jacob Sarratt (1772–1819) and rules by George Walker (1803–1879). In the 19th century, many major clubs published their own rules, including The Hague in 1803, London in 1807, Paris in 1836, and St. Petersburg in 1854. In 1851 Howard Staunton (1810–1874) called for a &quot;Constituent Assembly for Remodeling the Laws of Chess&quot; and proposals by Tassilo von Heydebrand und der Lasa (1818–1889) were published in 1854. Staunton had published rules in &quot;Chess Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; in 1847, and his new proposals were published in 1860 in &quot;Chess Praxis&quot;; they were generally accepted in English-speaking countries. German-speaking countries usually used the writings of chess authority Johann Berger (1845–1933) or &quot;Handbuch des Schachspiels&quot; by Paul Rudolf von Bilguer (1815–1840), first published in 1843.

In 1924, Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE) was formed and in 1928 it took up the task of standardizing the rules. At first FIDE tried to establish a universal set of rules, but translations to various languages differed slightly. Although FIDE rules were used for international competition under their control, some countries continued to use their own rules internally. In 1952, FIDE created the Permanent Commission for the Rules of Chess (also known as the Rules Commission) and published a new edition of the rules. The third official edition of the laws was published in 1966. The first three editions of the rules were published in French, with that as the official version. In 1974 FIDE published the English version of the rules (which was based on an authorized 1955 translation). With that edition, English became the official language of the rules. Another edition was published in 1979. Throughout this time, ambiguities in the laws were handled by frequent interpretations that the Rules Commission published as supplements and amendments. In 1982, the Rules Commission rewrote the laws to incorporate the interpretations and amendments. In 1984, FIDE abandoned the idea of a universal set of laws, although FIDE rules are the standard for high-level play. With the 1984 edition, FIDE implemented a four-year moratorium between changes to the rules. Other editions were issued in 1988 and 1992.

The rules of national FIDE affiliates (such as the United States Chess Federation, or USCF) are based on the FIDE rules, with slight variations. Some other differences are noted above. Kenneth Harkness published popular rulebooks in the United States starting in 1956, and the USCF continues to publish rulebooks for use in tournaments it sanctions.

In 2008, FIDE added the variant Chess960 to the appendix of the &quot;Laws of Chess&quot;. Chess960 uses a random initial set-up of main pieces, with the conditions that the king is placed somewhere between the two rooks, and bishops on opposite-color squares. The castling rules are extended to cover all these positions.

In the 21st century, rules about such things as mobile phones and unauthorized use of chess engines were introduced.

==Customizations in tournament play==
Under FIDE&#x27;s Laws of Chess, tournament organizers have the option to parameterize some rules to fit their events. This flexibility covers time controls for standard, rapid, and blitz chess, and setting the &#x27;default time&#x27; - the period before a player forfeits for being late, which is zero unless otherwise specified. Additionally, measures can be introduced to discourage players from agreeing to short draws. One such case was the &quot;no drawing or resigning during the first 30 moves&quot; rule used at the 2009 London Chess Classic.

<text>Apparent retrograde motion is the apparent motion of a planet in a direction opposite to that of other bodies within its system, as observed from a particular vantage point. Direct motion or prograde motion is motion in the same direction as other bodies.

While the terms &quot;direct&quot; and &quot;prograde&quot; are equivalent in this context, the former is the traditional term in astronomy. The earliest recorded use of &quot;prograde&quot; was in the early 18th century, although the term is now less common.

== Etymology and history ==

The term &quot;retrograde&quot; is from the Latin word – &quot;backward-step&quot;, the affix meaning &quot;backwards&quot; and &quot;step&quot;. &quot;Retrograde&quot; is most commonly an adjective used to describe the path of a planet as it travels through the night sky, with respect to the zodiac, stars, and other bodies of the celestial . In this context, the term refers to planets, as they appear from Earth, stopping briefly and reversing direction at certain times, though in reality, of course, we now understand that they perpetually orbit in the same uniform direction.

Although planets can sometimes be mistaken for stars as one observes the night sky, the planets actually change position from night to night in relation to the stars. Retrograde (backward) and prograde (forward) are observed as though the stars revolve around the Earth. Ancient Greek astronomer Ptolemy in 150 AD believed that the Earth was the center of the Solar System and therefore used the terms &quot;retrograde&quot; and &quot;prograde&quot; to describe the movement of the planets in relation to the stars. Although it is known today that the planets revolve around the Sun, the same terms continue to be used in order to describe the movement of the planets in relation to the stars as they are observed from Earth. Like the Sun, the planets appear to rise in the East and set in the West. When a planet travels eastward in relation to the stars, it is called &quot;prograde&quot;. When the planet travels westward in relation to the stars (opposite path) it is called &quot;retrograde&quot;.

This apparent retrogradation puzzled ancient astronomers, and was one reason they named these bodies &#x27;planets&#x27; in the first place: &#x27;Planet&#x27; comes from the Greek word for &#x27;wanderer&#x27;. In the geocentric model of the Solar System proposed by Apollonius in the third century BCE, retrograde motion was explained by having the planets travel in deferents and epicycles. It was not understood to be an illusion until the time of Copernicus, although the Greek astronomer Aristarchus in 240 BCE proposed a heliocentric model for the Solar System.

Galileo&#x27;s drawings show that he first observed Neptune on December 28, 1612, and again on January 27, 1613. On both occasions, Galileo mistook Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared very close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky, hence, he is not credited with Neptune&#x27;s discovery. During the period of his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that very day. Since Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo&#x27;s small telescope.

==Apparent motion==
=== From Earth ===
When standing on the Earth looking up at the sky, it would appear that the Moon travels from east to west, just as the Sun and the stars do. Day after day however, the Moon appears to move to the east with respect to the stars. In fact, the Moon orbits the Earth from west to east, as do the vast majority of manmade satellites such as the International Space Station. The apparent westward motion of the Moon from the Earth&#x27;s surface is actually an artifact of its being in a supersynchronous orbit. This means that the Earth completes one sidereal rotation before the Moon is able to complete one orbit. As a result, it looks like the Moon is travelling in the opposite direction, otherwise known as apparent retrograde motion. A person standing on Earth &quot;catches up&quot; to the Moon and passes it because the Earth completes one rotation before the Moon completes one orbit.

This phenomenon also occurs on Mars, which has two natural satellites, Phobos and Deimos. Both moons orbit Mars in an eastward (prograde) direction; however, Deimos has an orbital period of 1.23 Martian sidereal days, making it supersynchronous, whereas Phobos has an orbital period of 0.31 Martian sidereal days, making it subsynchronous. Consequently, although both moons are traveling in an eastward (prograde) direction, they appear to be traveling in opposite directions when viewed from the surface of Mars due to their orbital periods in relation to the rotational period of the planet.

All other planetary bodies in the Solar System also appear to periodically switch direction as they cross Earth&#x27;s sky. Though all stars and planets appear to move from east to west on a nightly basis in response to the rotation of Earth, the outer planets generally drift slowly eastward relative to the stars. Asteroids and Kuiper Belt objects (including Pluto) exhibit apparent retrograde motion. This motion is normal for the planets, and so is considered direct motion. However, since Earth completes its orbit in a shorter period of time than the planets outside its orbit, it periodically overtakes them, like a faster car on a multi-lane highway. When this occurs, the planet being passed will first appear to stop its eastward drift, and then drift back toward the west. Then, as Earth swings past the planet in its orbit, it appears to resume its normal motion west to east.Inner planets Venus and Mercury appear to move in retrograde in a similar mechanism, but as they can never be in opposition to the Sun as seen from Earth, their retrograde cycles are tied to their inferior conjunctions with the Sun. They are unobservable in the Sun&#x27;s glare and in their &quot;new&quot; phase, with mostly their dark sides toward Earth; they occur in the transition from evening star to morning star.

The more distant planets retrograde more frequently, as they do not move as much in their orbits while Earth completes an orbit itself. The retrograde motion of a hypothetical extremely distant (and nearly non-moving) planet would take place during a half-year, with the planet&#x27;s apparent yearly motion being reduced to a parallax ellipse.

The center of the retrograde motion occurs at the planet&#x27;s opposition which is when the planet is exactly opposite the Sun. This position is halfway, or 6 months, around the ecliptic from the Sun. The planet&#x27;s height in the sky is opposite that of the Sun&#x27;s height. The planet is at its highest at the winter solstice, and at its lowest at the summer solstice, on those (rare) occasions when it passes through the center of its retrograde motion near a solstice. Note particularly that the hemisphere the observer is in is critical to what they observe. The December Solstice will place the planet high in the northern hemisphere sky where it is winter and place it low in the southern hemisphere sky where it is summer. The opposite is true if this happens at the June Solstice. 

Since the planet&#x27;s opposition retrograde motion is when the Earth passes closest, the planet appears at its brightest for the year.

The period between the center of such retrogradations is the synodic period of the planet.

=== From Mercury ===

From any point on the daytime surface of Mercury when the planet is near perihelion (closest approach to the Sun), the Sun undergoes apparent retrograde motion. This occurs because, from approximately four Earth days before perihelion until approximately four Earth days after it, Mercury&#x27;s angular orbital speed exceeds its angular rotational velocity. Mercury&#x27;s elliptical orbit is farther from circular than that of any other planet in the Solar System, resulting in a substantially higher orbital speed near perihelion. As a result, at specific points on Mercury&#x27;s surface an observer would be able to see the Sun rise part way, then reverse and set before rising again, all within the same Mercurian day.

<doc id="48909" wikidata="Q82806" url="?curid=48909" title="Zenith">
<text>The zenith (, ) is the imaginary point on the celestial sphere directly &quot;above&quot; a particular location. &quot;Above&quot; means in the vertical direction (plumb line) opposite to the gravity direction at that location (nadir). The zenith is the &quot;highest&quot; point on the celestial sphere. The direction opposite of the zenith is the nadir.

==Origin==
The word &quot;zenith&quot; derives from an inaccurate reading of the Arabic expression (), meaning &quot;direction of the head&quot; or &quot;path above the head&quot;, by Medieval Latin scribes in the Middle Ages (during the 14th century), possibly through Old Spanish. It was reduced to &quot;samt&quot; (&quot;direction&quot;) and miswritten as &quot;senit&quot;/&quot;cenit&quot;, the &quot;m&quot; being misread as &quot;ni&quot;. Through the Old French &quot;cenith&quot;, &quot;zenith&quot; first appeared in the 17th century.

==Relevance and use==


The term &quot;zenith&quot; sometimes means the highest point, way, or level reached by a celestial body on its daily apparent path around a given point of observation. This sense of the word is often used to describe the position of the Sun (&quot;The sun reached its zenith...&quot;), but to an astronomer, the Sun does not have its own zenith and is at the zenith only if it is directly overhead.

In a scientific context, the zenith is the direction of reference for measuring the zenith angle (or zenith angular distance), the angle between a direction of interest (e.g. a star) and the local zenith - that is, the complement of the altitude angle (or elevation angle).

The Sun reaches the observer&#x27;s zenith when it is 90° above the horizon, and this only happens between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. The point where this occurs is known as the subsolar point. In Islamic astronomy, the passing of the Sun over the zenith of Mecca becomes the basis of the qibla observation by shadows twice a year on 27/28 May and 15/16 July.

At a given location during the course of a day, the Sun reaches not only its zenith but also its nadir, at the antipode of that location 12 hours from solar noon.

In astronomy, the altitude in the horizontal coordinate system and the zenith angle are complementary angles, with the horizon perpendicular to the zenith. The astronomical meridian is also determined by the zenith, and is defined as a circle on the celestial sphere that passes through the zenith, nadir, and the celestial poles.

A zenith telescope is a type of telescope designed to point straight up at or near the zenith, and used for precision measurement of star positions, to simplify telescope construction, or both. The NASA Orbital Debris Observatory and the Large Zenith Telescope are both zenith telescopes, since the use of liquid mirrors meant these telescopes could only point straight up.

On the International Space Station, &quot;zenith&quot; and &quot;nadir&quot; are used instead of &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot;, referring to directions within and around the station, relative to the earth.

===Zenith star===

Zenith stars (also &quot;star on top&quot;, &quot;overhead star&quot;, &quot;latitude star&quot;) are stars whose declination equals the latitude of the observers location, and hence at some time in the day or night pass culminate (pass) through the zenith. When at the zenith the right ascension of the star equals the local sidereal time at your location. In celestial navigation this allows latitude to be determined, since the declination of the star equals the latitude of the observer. If the current time at Greenwich is known at the time of the observation, the observers longitude can also be determined from the right ascension of the star. Hence &quot;Zenith stars&quot; lie on or near the circle of declination equal to the latitude of the observer (&quot;zenith circle&quot;). Zenith stars are not to be confused with &quot;steering stars&quot; of a sidereal compass rose of a sidereal compass.

<text>The horizon is the apparent curve that separates the surface of a celestial body from its sky when viewed from the perspective of an observer on or near the surface of the relevant body. This curve divides all viewing directions based on whether it intersects the relevant body&#x27;s surface or not.

The &quot;true horizon&quot; is a theoretical line, which can only be observed to any degree of accuracy when it lies along a relatively smooth surface such as that of Earth&#x27;s oceans. At many locations, this line is obscured by terrain, and on Earth it can also be obscured by life forms such as trees and/or human constructs such as buildings. The resulting intersection of such obstructions with the sky is called the &quot;visible horizon&quot;. On Earth, when looking at a sea from a shore, the part of the sea closest to the horizon is called the offing.

The true horizon surrounds the observer and it is typically assumed to be a circle, drawn on the surface of a perfectly spherical model of the relevant celestial body, i.e., a small circle of the local osculating sphere. With respect to Earth, the center of the true horizon is below the observer and below sea level. Its radius or horizontal distance from the observer varies slightly from day to day due to atmospheric refraction, which is greatly affected by weather conditions. Also, the higher the observer&#x27;s eyes are from sea level, the farther away the horizon is from the observer. For instance, in standard atmospheric conditions, for an observer with eye level above sea level by , the horizon is at a distance of about .
When observed from very high standpoints, such as a space station, the horizon is much farther away and it encompasses a much larger area of Earth&#x27;s surface. In this case, the horizon would no longer be a perfect circle, not even a plane curve such as an ellipse, especially when the observer is above the equator, as the Earth&#x27;s surface can be better modeled as an oblate ellipsoid than as a sphere.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;horizon&quot; derives from the Greek () &#x27;separating circle&#x27;, where is from the verb ὁρίζω () &#x27;to divide, to separate&#x27;, which in turn derives from () &#x27;boundary, landmark&#x27;.

== Appearance and usage ==

Historically, the distance to the visible horizon has long been vital to survival and successful navigation, especially at sea, because it determined an observer&#x27;s maximum range of vision and thus of communication, with all the obvious consequences for safety and the transmission of information that this range implied. This importance lessened with the development of the radio and the telegraph, but even today, when flying an aircraft under visual flight rules, a technique called attitude flying is used to control the aircraft, where the pilot uses the visual relationship between the aircraft&#x27;s nose and the horizon to control the aircraft. Pilots can also retain their spatial orientation by referring to the horizon.

In many contexts, especially perspective drawing, the curvature of the Earth is disregarded and the horizon is considered the theoretical line to which points on any horizontal plane converge (when projected onto the picture plane) as their distance from the observer increases. For observers near sea level, the difference between this &quot;geometrical horizon&quot; (which assumes a perfectly flat, infinite ground plane) and the &quot;true horizon&quot; (which assumes a spherical Earth surface) is imperceptible to the unaided eye. However, for someone on a hill looking out across the sea, the true horizon will be about a degree below a horizontal line.

In astronomy, the horizon is the horizontal plane through the eyes of the observer. It is the fundamental plane of the horizontal coordinate system, the locus of points that have an altitude of zero degrees. While similar in ways to the geometrical horizon, in this context a horizon may be considered to be a plane in space, rather than a line on a picture plane.

== Distance to the horizon ==

Ignoring the effect of atmospheric refraction, distance to the true horizon from an observer close to the Earth&#x27;s surface is about

:formula_1

where &quot;h&quot; is height above sea level and &quot;R&quot; is the Earth radius.

The expression can be simplified as:

:formula_2

where the constant equals &quot;k&quot;.
In this equation, Earth&#x27;s surface is assumed to be perfectly spherical, with &quot;R&quot; equal to about .

===Examples===
Assuming no atmospheric refraction and a spherical Earth with radius R=:
* For an observer standing on the ground with &quot;h&quot; = , the horizon is at a distance of .
* For an observer standing on the ground with &quot;h&quot; = , the horizon is at a distance of .
* For an observer standing on a hill or tower above sea level, the horizon is at a distance of .
* For an observer standing on a hill or tower above sea level, the horizon is at a distance of .
* For an observer standing on the roof of the Burj Khalifa, from ground, and about above sea level, the horizon is at a distance of .
* For an observer atop Mount Everest ( in altitude), the horizon is at a distance of .
* For an observer aboard a commercial passenger plane flying at a typical altitude of , the horizon is at a distance of .
* For a U-2 pilot, whilst flying at its service ceiling , the horizon is at a distance of .

=== Other planets ===
On terrestrial planets and other solid celestial bodies with negligible atmospheric effects, the distance to the horizon for a &quot;standard observer&quot; varies as the square root of the planet&#x27;s radius. Thus, the horizon on Mercury is 62% as far away from the observer as it is on Earth, on Mars the figure is 73%, on the Moon the figure is 52%, on Mimas the figure is 18%, and so on.

=== Derivation ===


If the Earth is assumed to be a featureless sphere (rather than an oblate spheroid) with no atmospheric refraction, then the distance to the horizon can easily be calculated.

The tangent-secant theorem states that
:formula_3
Make the following substitutions:
* &quot;d&quot; = OC = distance to the horizon
* &quot;D&quot; = AB = diameter of the Earth
* &quot;h&quot; = OB = height of the observer above sea level
* &quot;D+h&quot; = OA = diameter of the Earth plus height of the observer above sea level,

with &quot;d, D,&quot; and &quot;h&quot; all measured in the same units. The formula now becomes
:formula_4
or
:formula_5

where &quot;R&quot; is the radius of the Earth.

The same equation can also be derived using the Pythagorean theorem.
At the horizon, the line of sight is a tangent to the Earth and is also perpendicular to Earth&#x27;s radius. 
This sets up a right triangle, with the sum of the radius and the height as the hypotenuse. 
With

* &quot;d&quot; = distance to the horizon
* &quot;h&quot; = height of the observer above sea level
* &quot;R&quot; = radius of the Earth

referring to the second figure at the right leads to the following:

:formula_6
:formula_7
:formula_8

The exact formula above can be expanded as:

:formula_9

where &quot;R&quot; is the radius of the Earth (&quot;R&quot; and &quot;h&quot; must be in the same units). For example,
if a satellite is at a height of 2000 km, the distance to the horizon is ;
neglecting the second term in parentheses would give a distance of , a 7% error.

=== Approximation ===
If the observer is close to the surface of the Earth, then it is valid to disregard &quot;h&quot; in the term , and the formula becomes-

:formula_10

Using kilometres for &quot;d&quot; and &quot;R&quot;, and metres for &quot;h&quot;, and taking the radius of the Earth as 6371 km, the distance to the horizon is

:formula_11.

Using imperial units, with &quot;d&quot; and &quot;R&quot; in statute miles (as commonly used on land), and &quot;h&quot; in feet, the distance to the horizon is

:formula_12.

If &quot;d&quot; is in nautical miles, and &quot;h&quot; in feet, the constant factor is about 1.06, which is close enough to 1 that it is often ignored, giving:

:formula_13

These formulas may be used when &quot;h&quot; is much smaller than the radius of the Earth (6371 km or 3959 mi), including all views from any mountaintops, airplanes, or high-altitude balloons. With the constants as given, both the metric and imperial formulas are precise to within 1% (see the next section for how to obtain greater precision).
If &quot;h&quot; is significant with respect to &quot;R&quot;, as with most satellites, then the approximation is no longer valid, and the exact formula is required.

==Related measures==

===Arc distance===
Another relationship involves the great-circle distance &quot;s&quot; along the arc over the curved surface of the Earth to the horizon; this is more directly comparable to the geographical distance on a map.

It can be formulated in terms of &quot;γ&quot; in radians,

:formula_14

then

:formula_15

Solving for &quot;s&quot; gives

:formula_16

The distance &quot;s&quot; can also be expressed in terms of the line-of-sight distance &quot;d&quot;; from the second figure at the right,

:formula_17

substituting for &quot;γ&quot; and rearranging gives

:formula_18

The distances &quot;d&quot; and &quot;s&quot; are nearly the same when the height of the object is negligible compared to the radius (that is, &quot;h&quot; ≪ &quot;R&quot;).

===Zenith angle===

When the observer is elevated, the horizon zenith angle can be greater than 90°. The maximum visible zenith angle occurs when the ray is tangent to Earth&#x27;s surface; from triangle OCG in the figure at right,

:formula_19

where formula_20 is the observer&#x27;s height above the surface and formula_21 is the angular dip of the horizon. It is related to the horizon zenith angle formula_22 by:

:formula_23

For a non-negative height formula_20, the angle formula_22 is always ≥ 90°.

== Objects above the horizon ==
To compute the greatest distance &quot;D&quot;BL at which an observer B can see the top of an object L above the horizon, simply add the distances to the horizon from each of the two points:
:&quot;D&quot;BL = &quot;D&quot;B + &quot;D&quot;L
For example, for an observer B with a height of &quot;h&quot;B1.70 m standing on the ground, the horizon is &quot;D&quot;B4.65 km away. For a tower with a height of &quot;h&quot;L100 m, the horizon distance is &quot;D&quot;L35.7 km. Thus an observer on a beach can see the top of the tower as long as it is not more than &quot;D&quot;BL40.35 km away. Conversely, if an observer on a boat (&quot;h&quot;B1.7m) can just see the tops of trees on a nearby shore (&quot;h&quot;L10m), the trees are probably about &quot;D&quot;BL16 km away.

Referring to the figure at the right, and using the approximation above, the top of the lighthouse will be visible to a lookout in a crow&#x27;s nest at the top of a mast of the boat if
:formula_26
where &quot;D&quot;BL is in kilometres and &quot;h&quot;B and &quot;h&quot;L are in metres.

As another example, suppose an observer, whose eyes are two metres above the level ground, uses binoculars to look at a distant building which he knows to consist of thirty storeys, each 3.5 metres high. He counts the stories he can see and finds there are only ten. So twenty stories or 70 metres of the building are hidden from him by the curvature of the Earth. From this, he can calculate his distance from the building:

:formula_27

which comes to about 35 kilometres.

It is similarly possible to calculate how much of a distant object is visible above the horizon. Suppose an observer&#x27;s eye is 10 metres above sea level, and he is watching a ship that is 20 km away. His horizon is:

:formula_28

kilometres from him, which comes to about 11.3 kilometres away. The ship is a further 8.7 km away. The height of a point on the ship that is just visible to the observer is given by:

:formula_29

which comes to almost exactly six metres. The observer can therefore see that part of the ship that is more than six metres above the level of the water. The part of the ship that is below this height is hidden from him by the curvature of the Earth. In this situation, the ship is said to be hull-down.

== Effect of atmospheric refraction ==


Due to atmospheric refraction the distance to the visible horizon is further than the distance based on a simple geometric calculation. If the ground (or water) surface is colder than the air above it, a cold, dense layer of air forms close to the surface, causing light to be refracted downward as it travels, and therefore, to some extent, to go around the curvature of the Earth. The reverse happens if the ground is hotter than the air above it, as often happens in deserts, producing mirages. As an approximate compensation for refraction, surveyors measuring distances longer than 100 meters subtract 14% from the calculated curvature error and ensure lines of sight are at least 1.5 metres from the ground, to reduce random errors created by refraction.
If the Earth were an airless world like the Moon, the above calculations would be accurate. However, Earth has an atmosphere of air, whose density and refractive index vary considerably depending on the temperature and pressure. This makes the air refract light to varying extents, affecting the appearance of the horizon. Usually, the density of the air just above the surface of the Earth is greater than its density at greater altitudes. This makes its refractive index greater near the surface than at higher altitudes, which causes light that is travelling roughly horizontally to be refracted downward. This makes the actual distance to the horizon greater than the distance calculated with geometrical formulas. With standard atmospheric conditions, the difference is about 8%. This changes the factor of 3.57, in the metric formulas used above, to about 3.86. For instance, if an observer is standing on seashore, with eyes 1.70 m above sea level, according to the simple geometrical formulas given above the horizon should be 4.7 km away. Actually, atmospheric refraction allows the observer to see 300 metres farther, moving the true horizon 5 km away from the observer.

This correction can be, and often is, applied as a fairly good approximation when atmospheric conditions are close to standard. When conditions are unusual, this approximation fails. Refraction is strongly affected by temperature gradients, which can vary considerably from day to day, especially over water. In extreme cases, usually in springtime, when warm air overlies cold water, refraction can allow light to follow the Earth&#x27;s surface for hundreds of kilometres. Opposite conditions occur, for example, in deserts, where the surface is very hot, so hot, low-density air is below cooler air. This causes light to be refracted upward, causing mirage effects that make the concept of the horizon somewhat meaningless. Calculated values for the effects of refraction under unusual conditions are therefore only approximate. Nevertheless, attempts have been made to calculate them more accurately than the simple approximation described above.

Outside the visual wavelength range, refraction will be different. For radar (e.g. for wavelengths 300 to 3 mm i.e. frequencies between 1 and 100 GHz) the radius of the Earth may be multiplied by 4/3 to obtain an effective radius giving a factor of 4.12 in the metric formula i.e. the radar horizon will be 15% beyond the geometrical horizon or 7% beyond the visual. The 4/3 factor is not exact, as in the visual case the refraction depends on atmospheric conditions.

;Integration method—Sweer
If the density profile of the atmosphere is known, the distance &quot;d&quot; to the horizon is given by

:formula_30

where &quot;R&quot;E is the radius of the Earth, &quot;ψ&quot; is the dip of the horizon and &quot;δ&quot; is the refraction of the horizon. The dip is determined fairly simply from

:formula_31

where &quot;h&quot; is the observer&#x27;s height above the Earth, &quot;μ&quot; is the index of refraction of air at the observer&#x27;s height, and &quot;μ&quot;0 is the index of refraction of air at Earth&#x27;s surface.

The refraction must be found by integration of

:formula_32

where formula_33 is the angle between the ray and a line through the center of the Earth. The angles &quot;ψ&quot; and formula_33 are related by

:formula_35

;Simple method—Young
A much simpler approach, which produces essentially the same results as the first-order approximation described above, uses the geometrical model but uses a radius . The distance to the horizon is then

:formula_36

Taking the radius of the Earth as 6371 km, with &quot;d&quot; in km and &quot;h&quot; in m,

:formula_37

with &quot;d&quot; in mi and &quot;h&quot; in ft,

:formula_38

In the case of radar one typically has resulting (with &quot;d&quot; in km and &quot;h&quot; in m) in 

:formula_39

Results from Young&#x27;s method are quite close to those from Sweer&#x27;s method, and are sufficiently accurate for many purposes.

==Vanishing points==
The horizon is a key feature of the picture plane in the science of graphical perspective. Assuming the picture plane stands vertical to ground, and &quot;P&quot; is the perpendicular projection of the eye point &quot;O&quot; on the picture plane, the horizon is defined as the horizontal line through &quot;P&quot;. The point &quot;P&quot; is the vanishing point of lines perpendicular to the picture. If &quot;S&quot; is another point on the horizon, then it is the vanishing point for all lines parallel to &quot;OS&quot;. But Brook Taylor (1719) indicated that the horizon plane determined by &quot;O&quot; and the horizon was like any other plane:
:The term of Horizontal Line, for instance, is apt to confine the Notions of a Learner to the Plane of the Horizon, and to make him imagine, that that Plane enjoys some particular Privileges, which make the Figures in it more easy and more convenient to be described, by the means of that Horizontal Line, than the Figures in any other plane;…But in this Book I make no difference between the Plane of the Horizon, and any other Plane whatsoever...
The peculiar geometry of perspective where parallel lines converge in the distance, stimulated the development of projective geometry which posits a point at infinity where parallel lines meet. In her book &quot;Geometry of an Art&quot; (2007), Kirsti Andersen described the evolution of perspective drawing and science up to 1800, noting that vanishing points need not be on the horizon. In a chapter titled &quot;Horizon&quot;, John Stillwell recounted how projective geometry has led to incidence geometry, the modern abstract study of line intersection. Stillwell also ventured into foundations of mathematics in a section titled &quot;What are the Laws of Algebra ?&quot; The &quot;algebra of points&quot;, originally given by Karl von Staudt deriving the axioms of a field was deconstructed in the twentieth century, yielding a wide variety of mathematical possibilities. Stillwell states
:This discovery from 100 years ago seems capable of turning mathematics upside down, though it has not yet been fully absorbed by the mathematical community. Not only does it defy the trend of turning geometry into algebra, it suggests that both geometry and algebra have a simpler foundation than previously thought.

<text>A prince regent or princess regent is a prince or princess who, due to their position in the line of succession, rules a monarchy as regent in the stead of a monarch, e.g., as a result of the sovereign&#x27;s incapacity (minority or illness) or absence (e.g., by remoteness, such as exile or long voyage, or the absence of an incumbent).

While the term itself can have the generic meaning and refer to any prince or princess who fills the role of regent, historically it has mainly been used to describe a small number of individual princes and princesses who were regents of non-principalities.

==Prince Regent of the United Kingdom==

In the English language the title &quot;Prince Regent&quot; is most commonly associated with George IV, who held the style His Royal Highness The Prince Regent during the Regency era due to the incapacity (by dint of mental illness) of his father, George III (see Regent for other regents). Regent&#x27;s Park, Regent Street and Regent&#x27;s Canal (which he commissioned) in London, were all named in honour of him. The architect John Nash, under the patronage of HRH The Prince Regent, planned a palatial summer residence for the prince, 50 detached villas in a parkland setting and elegant terraces around the exterior of the park. This was all part of an ambitious plan, to develop The Regent&#x27;s Park and lay out an elegant new street, Regent&#x27;s Street, to link it to St James&#x27;s Park and the prince&#x27;s London residence, Carlton House. Regent Terrace in Edinburgh is also named after the Prince Regent, who visited the area in 1822.

This period is known as the British Regency, or just the Regency.

The title was conferred by the Regency Act on 5 February 1811. Subject to certain limitations for a period, the prince regent was able to exercise the full powers of the King. The precedent of the Regency Crisis of 1788 (from which George III recovered before it was necessary to appoint a regent) was followed. The Prince of Wales continued as regent until his father&#x27;s death in 1820, when he became George IV.

==Prince regent in Germany==
In Germany, the title &quot;Prinzregent&quot; (literally prince regent) is most commonly associated with Prince Luitpold of Bavaria, who served as regent for two of his nephews, King Ludwig II of Bavaria, who was declared mentally incompetent in 1886, and King Otto of Bavaria (who had been declared insane in 1875) from 1886 until 1912.

The years of Luitpold&#x27;s regency were marked by tremendous artistic and cultural activity in Bavaria, where they are known after the regencies as the &quot;Prinzregentenjahre&quot; or the &quot;Prinzregentenzeit&quot;. Numerous streets in Bavarian cities and towns are called &quot;Prinzregentenstraße&quot;. Many institutions are named in Luitpold&#x27;s honour, &quot;e.g.&quot;, the &quot;Prinzregententheater&quot; in Munich. &quot;Prinzregententorte&quot; is a multi-layered cake with chocolate butter cream named in Luitpold&#x27;s honour.

At Luitpold&#x27;s death in 1912, his son Prince Ludwig succeeded as prince regent. Ludwig held the title for less than a year, since the Bavarian Legislature decided to set aside his cousin King Otto I of Bavaria and recognize him as king.

==Prince regent in Belgium==
*The first head of state of Belgium after it seceded from the Dutch monarchy in 1831 was a regent (but not a prince in his own right), baron Erasme Louis Surlet de Chokier, before the new nation, which had chosen to become a parliamentary monarchy, had its first king sworn into the constitution.
*Prince Charles of Belgium served as prince regent of Belgium from 1944 to 1950 during the German captivity and exile to Switzerland of his elder brother, King Leopold III of Belgium amidst ongoing political controversy about Leopold&#x27;s fitness to serve as head of state.

==Prince regent in Bulgaria==

Kiril, Prince of Preslav was appointed head of a regency council by the Bulgarian parliament following the death of his brother, Tsar Boris III on 28 August 1943, to act as Head of State until the late Tsar&#x27;s son and successor, Tsar Simeon II, reached the age of 18 years. On 5 September 1944 the Soviet Union declared war on the Kingdom of Bulgaria and on 8 September Soviet armies crossed the Romanian border and occupied the country. On 1 February 1945 the prince regent Kyril, and the two other former regents – Professor Bogdan Filov and General Nikola Mikhov – as well as a range of former cabinet ministers, royal advisors and 67 MPs, were executed.

==Prince Lieutenant in Luxembourg==
The heir-apparent or heir-presumptive to the grand duke of Luxembourg may be titled &quot;prince-lieutenant&quot; (&#x27;prince deputy&#x27;) during a period in which the incumbent remains formally on the grand ducal throne, but (progressively, most) functions of the crown are performed by the &#x27;monarch apprentice&#x27;, as prince Jean did 4 May 1961 – 12 November 1964 in the last years of his mother Charlotte&#x27;s reign until she abdicated and he succeeded to the grand ducal throne (she lived until 1985), and Jean&#x27;s own son prince Henri 3 March 1998 – 7 October 2000 until his father abdicated and he succeeded (Jean lived until 2019).

==Queen regent==
If a king is unable to perform his duties then his consort or the queen mother may act for him as a &quot;Queen Regent&quot;. Queen mothers have acted in this way in the Kingdom of Eswatini.

==Other notable princes and princesses regent==
:&quot;More prince-regents (often without such specific title) are to be found in List of regents.&quot;
*Duke of Zhou Dan served as prince regent for his nephew King Cheng of Zhou until the latter came of age.
*Philippe II, Duke of Orléans was Regent of France from the death of Louis XIV in 1715 until Louis XV came of age in 1723; this is also used as a period label for many aspects of French history, as &quot;Régence&quot; in French. 
*Te Wherowhero Tawhiao, younger brother of Māori King Mahuta Tāwhiao, served as Whirinaki-a-te-Kiingi (Prince Regent) for his brother from 1903 to 1910. This was because Mahuta Tāwhiao spent this period of his reign as a member of the Legislative Council. 
*Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark served as regent from 1784 to 1808 for his father, King Christian VII of Denmark, who was insane.
*Prince William of Prussia served as regent from 1858 to 1861 for his older brother King Frederick William IV of Prussia, who had become mentally unfit to rule.
*Prince Dorgon of the early Qing dynasty served as regent for his nephew, the Shunzhi Emperor, from 1643 to 1650, because the latter was only six at the time of his ascension. Dorgon was instrumental in moving Manchu forces into Beijing in 1644, proclaiming the Qing dynasty to be the legitimate successor to the Ming dynasty. In Qing dynasty historical records, Dorgon was the first to be referred to as &quot;Shezhengwang&quot; (摄政王; &quot;Prince regent&quot;).
*Rameses the Great
*Prince Chun of the late Qing dynasty served as regent from 1908 to 1911 for his son Puyi, the Xuantong Emperor. Apart from Dorgon, Zaifeng was the only person in Chinese history who was specifically referred to as prince regent.
*Crown Prince Hirohito served as regent from 1921 to 1926 for his ailing father, Emperor Taishō.
*Prince Paul of Yugoslavia from 1934 to 1941, known in Serbian as &quot;Његово Краљевско Височанство, Кнез Намесник&quot; (English: His Royal Highness The Prince Regent) served as regent for his first cousin once removed, King Peter II who was a minor.
* John, Prince of Brazil (1767–1826) served as regent of Portugal for his mother Queen Maria I, who had become mentally unfit to rule, from 1799 to 1816. His regency was associated with the transfer of the Portuguese court to Brazil.
*Princess Erelu Kuti of Lagos, a Yoruba chieftess of the eighteenth century who served as queen mother of a line of tribal kings. The successors to the noble title that now shares her name have all subsequently served as regent of Lagos following the death of a reigning oba. Princesses are traditionally called upon to serve as regents in this fashion in most of the other kingdoms of Yorubaland as well. In Akure, for example, the eldest daughter of a recently deceased king ruled in his stead until a substantive successor to the royal title was chosen by the college of noble kingmakers, a period that lasted for an unusually long six years due to a succession crisis in the state.
*Chief Tshekedi Khama of the Bamangwato, a Tswana prince who served as regent during the reign of his famous nephew, Sir Seretse Khama. He opposed Sir Seretse&#x27;s marriage to Lady Khama on the grounds that it would have an adverse effect on the chieftaincy, and attempted to claim the tribal throne in his stead thereafter because of it. He was ultimately unsuccessful.
*Anne of France served as regent of France for her younger brother between 1483-1491.
*Sophia Alekseyevna from 1682-1689 as regent of Russia on behalf of her younger brothers.
*Aurora Pinedo served as Princess Regent of the Afro-Bolivian monarchy from 1954-1992.
*Prince Nicholas of Romania served as a prince regent between 1927 and 1930 for his minor nephew, King Michael I of Romania. Nicholas&#x27; brother, King Carol II of Romania, was refusing the throne of Romania since 1925, but in 1930, he came back dethroned his own son.

<doc id="48913" wikidata="Q167433" url="?curid=48913" title="Caroline of Brunswick">
<text>Caroline of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (Caroline Amelia Elizabeth; 17 May 1768 – 7 August 1821) was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and Queen of Hanover from 29 January 1820 until her death in 1821 as the estranged wife of King George IV. She was Princess of Wales from 1795 to 1820.

The daughter of Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick, and Princess Augusta of Great Britain, Caroline was engaged in 1794 to her cousin George, Prince of Wales, whom she had never met. He was already illegally married to Maria Fitzherbert. George and Caroline married the following year but separated shortly after the birth of their only child, Princess Charlotte, in 1796. By 1806, rumours that Caroline had taken multiple lovers and had an illegitimate child led to an investigation into her private life. The dignitaries who led the investigation concluded that there was &quot;no foundation&quot; to the rumours, but Caroline&#x27;s access to her daughter was still restricted. In 1814, Caroline moved to Italy, where she employed Bartolomeo Pergami as a servant. Pergami soon became Caroline&#x27;s closest companion, and it was widely assumed that they were lovers. In 1817, Caroline was devastated when Charlotte died in childbirth. She heard the news from a passing courier as George had refused to write and tell her. He was determined to divorce Caroline and set up a second investigation to collect evidence of her adultery.

In January 1820, George became King of the United Kingdom and Hanover, and Caroline became nominal queen consort. George insisted on a divorce from Caroline, which she refused. A legal divorce was possible but difficult to obtain. Caroline returned to Britain to assert her position as queen. She was wildly popular with the British people, who sympathised with her and despised the new king for his immoral behaviour. On the basis of the loose evidence collected against her, George attempted to divorce Caroline by introducing the Pains and Penalties Bill 1820 to Parliament, but he and the bill were so unpopular and Caroline so popular with the masses that it was withdrawn by the Liverpool ministry. The King barred Caroline from his coronation in July 1821. She fell ill in London and died three weeks later. Her funeral procession passed through London on its way to her native Brunswick, where she was buried.

==Early life==
Caroline was born a princess of Braunschweig, known in English as &quot;Brunswick&quot;, with the courtesy title of Duchess of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, on 17 May 1768 at Braunschweig in Germany. She was the daughter of Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, and his wife Princess Augusta of Great Britain, eldest sister of King George III.

Caroline was brought up in a difficult family situation. Her mother resented her father&#x27;s open adultery with Baroness Luise von Hertefeld, whom he had installed as his official mistress in 1777, and Caroline was later to confide to Lady Charlotte Campbell that she was often tired of being a &quot;shuttlecock&quot; between her parents, as whenever she was civil to one of them, she was scolded by the other.

She was educated by governesses, but the only subject in which she was given a higher education was music. From 1783 until 1791, Countess Eleonore von Münster was her governess, and won her affection, but never managed to teach her to spell correctly, as Caroline preferred to dictate to a secretary. Caroline could understand English and French, but her father admitted that she was lacking in education.

According to Caroline&#x27;s mother, who was British, all German princesses learned English in the hope that they would be chosen to marry George, Prince of Wales, George III&#x27;s eldest son and heir apparent and Caroline&#x27;s first cousin.

John Stanley, later 1st Baron Stanley of Alderley, saw her in 1781, and noted that she was an attractive girl with curly, fair hair. In 1784, she was described as a beauty, and two years later, Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau described her as &quot;most amiable, lively, playful, witty and handsome&quot;.

Caroline was brought up with extremely limited contact with the opposite sex even by the standards of her own time. She was reportedly constantly supervised by her governess and elder ladies, restricted to her room when the family was entertaining and ordered to keep away from the windows. She was normally refused permission to attend balls and court functions, and when allowed, she was forbidden to dance. Abbé Baron commented during the winter of 1789–90: &quot;She is supervised with the greatest severity, as they claim she is already aware of what she is missing. I doubt if the torches of Hymen will illuminate for her [i.e.I think she will never marry]. Although always attired with style and elegance, she is never allowed to dance&quot;, and that as soon as the first dance began, she was forced to sit down at the whist table with three old ladies.

A rare occasion was the wedding of her elder brother Charles, when she was finally allowed to dance, though only with the groom and his new brother-in-law, the Prince of Orange – she was, however, still forbidden to dine alone with her brother.

Her secluded isolation tormented her, which was demonstrated when she was later again banned from attending a ball. She simulated an illness so severe that her parents left the ball to see her. When they arrived, she claimed to be in labour and forced them to send for a midwife. When the midwife arrived, she stopped her simulation and asked her mother: &quot;Now, Madam, will you keep me another time from a ball?&quot;

Her mother early favoured a match between one of her children and a member of her English family, and when her nephew Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany visited Brunswick in June 1781, she lamented the fact that Caroline, because of her age, could not be present very often. Caroline was given a number of proposals from 1782 onward. Marriage with the Prince of Orange, Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt, Charles, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and the second son of the Margrave of Baden were all suggested, while her mother and father supported an English and a Prussian Prince, respectively, but none came to fruition. Caroline was later to state that her father had forbidden her to marry a man she had fallen in love with because of his low status. The identity of this man is not clear, but contemporaries point out an officer who was referred to at the time as the &quot;Handsome Irishman&quot; who lived in Brunswick, and with whom Caroline was said to have been in love. There was also a rumour that Caroline had given birth at the age of fifteen.

Though she was not allowed to socialise with men, she was allowed to ride, and during riding, she visited the cottages of the peasantry. She had done this already as a child, during which she had met children to play with, and as an adult, one of these visits allegedly led to a pregnancy. There is no confirmation of this rumour, but it was well known during her life, and referred to as a reason why she married at an older age than was usual, despite being regarded as good-looking and having been given so many proposals.

==Engagement==

In 1794, Caroline and the Prince of Wales were engaged. They had never met—George had agreed to marry her because he was heavily in debt, and if he contracted a marriage with an eligible princess, Parliament would increase his allowance. Caroline seemed eminently suitable: she was a Protestant of royal birth, and the marriage would ally Brunswick and Britain. Although Brunswick was only a small country, Britain was at war with revolutionary France and so was eager to obtain allies on the European mainland. Brunswick was ruled by Caroline&#x27;s father, the esteemed soldier Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick, who himself had married Princess Augusta, the sister of George III. On 20 November 1794, Lord Malmesbury arrived at Brunswick to escort Caroline to her new life in Britain. In his diary, Malmesbury recorded his reservations about Caroline&#x27;s suitability as a bride for the prince: she lacked judgement, decorum and tact, spoke her mind too readily, acted indiscreetly, and often neglected to wash, or change her dirty clothes. He went on to say that she had &quot;some natural but no acquired morality, and no strong innate notions of its value and necessity&quot;. However, Malmesbury was impressed by her bravery; on the journey to England, the party heard cannon fire, as they were not far from the French lines. While Caroline&#x27;s mother, who was accompanying them to the coast as chaperone, was concerned for their safety, Caroline was unfazed.

On 28 March 1795, Caroline and Malmesbury left Cuxhaven on the &quot;Jupiter&quot;. Delayed by poor weather, they landed a week later, on Easter Sunday, 5 April, at Greenwich. There, she met Frances Villiers, Countess of Jersey, George&#x27;s mistress, who had been appointed Caroline&#x27;s Lady of the Bedchamber. Smith concludes that:
: She was chosen as the intended bride of George, Prince of Wales partly because her mother was a favourite sister of George III, partly through the favourable reports of her given by his brothers the Dukes of York and Clarence when they visited Germany, and partly for lack of a suitable alternative German Protestant princess.

On meeting his future wife for the first time, George called for a glass of brandy. He was evidently disappointed. Similarly, Caroline told Malmesbury, &quot;[the Prince is] very fat and he&#x27;s nothing like as handsome as his portrait.&quot; At dinner that evening, the Prince was appalled by Caroline&#x27;s garrulous nature and her gibes at the expense of Lady Jersey. She was upset and disappointed by George&#x27;s obvious partiality for Lady Jersey over her.

==Troubled marriage==

Caroline and George were married on 8 April 1795 at the Chapel Royal, St. James&#x27;s Palace, in London. At the ceremony, George was drunk. He regarded Caroline as unattractive and unhygienic, and told Malmesbury that he suspected that she was not a virgin when they married. He had already undergone a form of marriage with Maria Fitzherbert, but as this violated the Royal Marriages Act 1772, both George and Maria knew it was not legally valid.

In a letter to a friend, the prince claimed that the couple only had sexual intercourse three times: twice the first night of the marriage, and once the second night. He wrote, &quot;it required no small [effort] to conquer my aversion and overcome the disgust of her person.&quot; Caroline claimed George was so drunk that he &quot;passed the greatest part of his bridal night under the grate, where he fell, and where I left him&quot;.

Nine months after the wedding, Caroline gave birth to Princess Charlotte, George&#x27;s only legitimate child, and at that point the king&#x27;s only legitimate grandchild, at Carlton House on 7 January 1796. Charlotte was second in the line of succession to the British throne after her father. Just three days after Charlotte&#x27;s birth, George made out a new will. He left all his property to &quot;Maria Fitzherbert, my wife&quot;, while to Caroline he left one shilling.

Gossip about Caroline and George&#x27;s troubled marriage was already circulating. The newspapers claimed that Lady Jersey opened, read and distributed the contents of Caroline&#x27;s private letters. She despised Lady Jersey and could not visit or travel anywhere without George&#x27;s permission. The press vilified George for his extravagance and luxury at a time of war and portrayed Caroline as a wronged wife. She was cheered in public and gained plaudits for her &quot;winning familiarity&quot; and easy, open nature. George was dismayed at her popularity and his own unpopularity, and felt trapped in a loveless marriage with a woman he loathed. He wanted a separation.
In April 1796, George wrote to Caroline, &quot;We have unfortunately been oblig&#x27;d to acknowledge to each other that we cannot find happiness in our union. ... Let me therefore beg you to make the best of a situation unfortunate for us both.&quot; In June, Lady Jersey resigned as Caroline&#x27;s Lady of the Bedchamber. George and Caroline were already living separately, and in August 1797 Caroline moved to a private residence: The Vicarage or Old Rectory in Charlton, London. Later, she moved to Montagu House in Blackheath. No longer constrained by her husband, or, according to rumour, her marital vows, she entertained whomever she pleased. She flirted with Admiral Sir Sidney Smith and Captain Thomas Manby, and may have had a brief relationship with the politician George Canning.

===Delicate Investigation===

Charlotte was placed in the care of a governess, in a mansion near Montagu House in the summers, and Caroline visited her often. It seems that a single daughter was not sufficient to sate Caroline&#x27;s maternal instincts, and she adopted eight or nine poor children who were fostered out to people in the district. In 1802, she adopted a three-month-old boy, William Austin, and took him into her home. By 1805, Caroline had fallen out with her near neighbours, Sir John and Lady Douglas, who claimed that Caroline had sent them obscene and harassing letters. Lady Douglas accused Caroline of infidelity, and alleged that William Austin was Caroline&#x27;s illegitimate son.

In 1806, a secret commission was set up, known as the &quot;Delicate Investigation&quot;, to examine Lady Douglas&#x27;s claims. The commission comprised four of the most eminent men in the country: Prime Minister Lord Grenville, the Lord Chancellor Lord Erskine, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales Lord Ellenborough and the Home Secretary Lord Spencer. Lady Douglas testified that Caroline herself had admitted to her in 1802 that she was pregnant, and that Austin was her son. She further alleged that Caroline had been rude about the royal family, touched her in an inappropriately sexual way, and had admitted that any woman friendly with a man was sure to become his lover. In addition to Smith, Manby and Canning, artist Thomas Lawrence and Henry Hood, son of Lord Hood, were also mentioned as potential paramours. Caroline&#x27;s servants could or would not confirm that these gentlemen were her lovers, nor that she had been pregnant, and said that the child had been brought to Caroline&#x27;s house by his true mother, Sophia Austin. Sophia was summoned before the commissioners, and testified that the child was hers.

The commissioners decided that there was &quot;no foundation&quot; for the allegations, but despite being a supposedly secret investigation, it proved impossible to prevent gossip from spreading, and news of the investigation leaked to the press. Caroline&#x27;s conduct with her gentlemen friends was considered improper, but there was no direct proof that she had been guilty of anything more than flirtation. Perhaps Caroline had told Lady Douglas that she was pregnant out of frustrated maternal desire, or as part of a foolish prank that, unfortunately for her, backfired. Later in the year, Caroline received further bad news as Brunswick was overrun by the French, and her father was killed in the battle of Jena-Auerstadt. Her mother and brother, Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, fled to England. Caroline had wanted to return to Brunswick and leave Britain behind her, but with much of Europe controlled by the French she had no safe haven to run to.

During the Delicate Investigation, Caroline was not permitted to see her daughter, and afterwards her visits were essentially restricted to once a week and only in the presence of Caroline&#x27;s own mother, the Dowager Duchess of Brunswick. Meetings took place at either Blackheath or an apartment in Kensington Palace designated for Caroline&#x27;s use.

===Social isolation===

By the end of 1811, King George III had become permanently insane, and the Prince of Wales was appointed regent. He restricted Caroline&#x27;s access to Princess Charlotte further, and Caroline became more socially isolated as members of high society chose to patronise George&#x27;s extravagant parties rather than hers. She moved her London residence to Connaught House in Bayswater. Caroline needed a powerful ally to help her oppose George&#x27;s increasing ability to prevent her from seeing her daughter. In league with Henry Brougham, an ambitious Whig politician who favoured reform, she began a propaganda campaign against George. George countered by leaking Lady Douglas&#x27;s testimony from the &quot;Delicate Investigation&quot;, which Brougham repudiated by leaking the testimonies of the servants and Mrs Austin. Charlotte favoured her mother&#x27;s point of view, as did most of the public. Jane Austen wrote of Caroline: &quot;Poor woman, I shall support her as long as I can, because she &quot;is&quot; a Woman and because I hate her Husband.&quot;

In 1814, after Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, nobility from throughout Europe attended celebrations in London, but Caroline was excluded. George&#x27;s relationship with his daughter was also deteriorating, as Charlotte sought greater freedom from her father&#x27;s strictures. On 12 July, he informed Charlotte that she would henceforth be confined at Cranbourne Lodge, Windsor, that her household would be replaced, and that she could have no visitors except her grandmother Queen Charlotte once a week. Horrified, Princess Charlotte ran away to her mother&#x27;s house in Bayswater. After an anxious night, Charlotte was eventually persuaded to return to her father by Brougham, since legally she could be placed in her father&#x27;s care and there was a danger of public disorder against George, which might prejudice Charlotte&#x27;s position if she continued to disobey him.

Caroline, unhappy at her situation and treatment in Britain, negotiated a deal with the Foreign Secretary, Lord Castlereagh. She agreed to leave the country in exchange for an annual allowance of £35,000. Both Brougham and Charlotte were dismayed by Caroline&#x27;s decision, as they both realised that Caroline&#x27;s absence would strengthen George&#x27;s power and weaken theirs. On 8 August 1814, Caroline left Britain.

==Exile==
After a two-week visit to Brunswick, Caroline headed for Italy through Switzerland. Along the way, possibly in Milan, she hired Bartolomeo Pergami as a servant. Pergami soon rose to the head of Caroline&#x27;s household, and managed to get his sister, Angelica, Countess of Oldi, appointed as Caroline&#x27;s lady-in-waiting. In mid-1815, Caroline bought a house, Villa d&#x27;Este, on the shores of Lake Como, even though her finances were stretched.

From early 1816, she and Pergami went on a cruise around the Mediterranean, visiting Napoleon&#x27;s former palace on Elba, and Sicily, where Pergami obtained the Order of Malta and a barony. By this time, Caroline and Pergami were openly eating together, and it was widely rumoured that they were lovers. They visited Tunis, Malta, Milos, Athens, Corinth, Constantinople, and Nazareth. Caroline entered Jerusalem riding on a donkey in a convoy of camels. Pergami was made a Knight of the Order of Saint Lazarus. Caroline instituted the Order of Saint Caroline, nominating Pergami its Grand Master. In August, they returned to Italy, stopping at Rome to visit Pope Pius VII.
By this time, gossip about Caroline was everywhere. Lord Byron wrote to his publisher that Caroline and Pergami were lovers, and Sir Francis Ronalds described and made a sketch of their sleeping arrangements in Karlsruhe. Baron Friedrich Ompteda, a Hanoverian spy, bribed one of Caroline&#x27;s servants so that he could search her bedroom for proof of adultery. He found none. By August 1817, Caroline&#x27;s debts were growing, so she sold Villa d&#x27;Este and moved to the smaller Villa Caprile near Pesaro. Pergami&#x27;s mother, brother and daughter, but not his wife, joined Caroline&#x27;s household.

The previous year, Caroline&#x27;s daughter, Princess Charlotte, had married Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and the future of the British monarchy looked bright. Then tragedy struck: in November 1817, Charlotte died after giving birth to her only child, a stillborn son. For the most part, Charlotte had been immensely popular with the public, and her death was a blow to the country. George refused to write to Caroline to inform her, leaving it for their son-in-law Leopold to do, but Leopold was deep in grief and delayed writing. George did, however, write to the Pope of the tragedy, and by chance the courier carrying the letter passed by Pesaro, and so it was that Caroline heard the devastating news. Caroline had lost her daughter, but she had also lost any chance of regaining position through the succession of her daughter to the throne.

George was determined to press ahead with a divorce and set up a commission chaired by the Vice-Chancellor John Leach to gather evidence of Caroline&#x27;s adultery. Leach sent three commissioners to Milan to interrogate Caroline&#x27;s former servants, including Theodore Majocchi and Caroline&#x27;s maid, Louise Demont. In London, Brougham was still acting as Caroline&#x27;s agent. Concerned that the &quot;Milan commission&quot; might threaten Caroline, he sent his brother James to Caroline&#x27;s villa in the hope of establishing whether George had any grounds for divorce. James wrote back to his brother of Caroline and Pergami, &quot;they are to all appearances man and wife, never was anything so obvious.&quot; The Milan commission was assembling more and more evidence, and by 1819 Caroline was worried. She informed James Brougham that she would agree to a divorce in exchange for money. However, at this time in England divorce by mutual consent was illegal; it was only possible to divorce if one of the partners admitted or was found guilty of adultery. Caroline said it was &quot;impossible&quot; for her to admit that, so the Broughams advised that only formal separation was possible. Both keen to avoid publicity, the Broughams and the Government discussed a deal where Caroline would be called by a lesser title, such as &quot;Duchess of Cornwall&quot; rather than &quot;Princess of Wales&quot;. As the negotiations continued at the end of 1819, Caroline travelled to France, which gave rise to speculation that she was on her way back to England. In January 1820, however, she made plans to return to Italy, but then on 29 January 1820 George III died. Caroline&#x27;s husband became king and, at least nominally, she was queen of the United Kingdom.

==Queen consort==
Instead of being treated like a queen, Caroline found that her estranged husband&#x27;s accession paradoxically made her position worse. On visiting Rome, Pope Pius VII refused her an audience, and the Pope&#x27;s minister Cardinal Consalvi insisted that she be greeted only as a duchess of Brunswick, and not as a queen. In an attempt to assert her rights, she made plans to return to Britain. The King demanded that his ministers get rid of her. He successfully persuaded them to remove her name from the liturgy of the Church of England, but they would not agree to a divorce because they feared the effect of a public trial. The government was weak and unpopular, and a trial detailing salacious details of both Caroline&#x27;s and George&#x27;s separate love lives was certain to destabilise it further. Rather than run the risk, the government entered into negotiations with Caroline, and offered her an increased annuity of £50,000 if she stayed abroad.

By the beginning of June 1820, Caroline had travelled north from Italy, and was at St Omer near Calais. Acting on the advice of Alderman Matthew Wood and her lady-in-waiting Lady Anne Hamilton, she rejected the government&#x27;s offer. She bid farewell to Pergami, and embarked for England. When she arrived on 5 June, riots broke out in support of her. Caroline was a figurehead for the growing Radical movement that demanded political reform and opposed the unpopular king. Nevertheless, the King still adamantly desired a divorce and, the following day, he submitted the evidence gathered by the Milan commission to Parliament in two green bags. On 15 June, the guards in the King&#x27;s Mews mutinied. The mutiny was contained, but the government was fearful of further unrest. Examination of the bags of evidence was delayed as Parliament debated the form of the investigation, but eventually, on 27 June, they were opened and examined in secret by 15 peers. The peers considered the contents scandalous, and a week later, after their report to the House, the government introduced a bill in Parliament, the Pains and Penalties Bill 1820, to strip Caroline of the title of queen and dissolve her marriage. It was claimed that Caroline had committed adultery with a low-born man: Bartolomeo Pergami. Various witnesses, such as Theodore Majocchi, were called during the reading of the bill, which was effectively a public trial of the Queen. The trial caused a sensation, as details of Caroline&#x27;s familiarity with Pergami were revealed. Witnesses said the couple had slept in the same room, kissed, and been seen together in a state of undress. The bill passed the House of Lords, but was not submitted to the House of Commons as there was little prospect that the Commons would pass it. To her friends, Caroline joked that she had indeed committed adultery once—with the husband of Mrs. Fitzherbert, the King.

Even during the trial, the Queen remained immensely popular, as witnessed by over 800 petitions and nearly a million signatures that favoured her cause. As a figurehead of the opposition movement demanding reform, many revolutionary pronouncements were made in Caroline&#x27;s name.
But with the end of the trial, her alliance with the radicals came to an end. The government again extended the offer of £50,000 a year, this time without preconditions, and Caroline accepted.

On 5 May 1821, Napoleon died on St Helena. Sir Edmund Nagle informed George, &quot;Sir, your bitterest enemy is dead&quot;. He replied, &quot;Is she, by God!&quot;.

Despite the King&#x27;s best attempts, Caroline retained a strong popularity among the masses, and pressed ahead with plans to attend the coronation service on 19 July 1821 as queen. Lord Liverpool told Caroline that she should not go to the service, but she turned up anyway. George had Caroline turned away from the coronation at the doors of Westminster Abbey. Refused entry at both the doors to the East Cloister and the doors to the West Cloister, Caroline attempted to enter via Westminster Hall, where many guests were gathered before the service began. A witness described how the Queen stood at the door fuming as bayonets were held under her chin until the deputy lord chamberlain had the doors slammed in her face. Caroline then proceeded back to an entrance near Poets&#x27; Corner, where she was met by Sir Robert Inglis, who held the office of &quot;Gold Staff&quot;. Inglis persuaded her to return to her carriage, and she left. Caroline lost support through her exhibition at the coronation; the crowds jeered her as she rode away, and even Brougham recorded his distaste at her undignified behaviour.

==Death==

The night following Caroline&#x27;s failed attempt to attend her husband&#x27;s coronation, she fell ill and took a large dose of milk of magnesia and some drops of laudanum. Over the next three weeks, she suffered more and more pain as her condition deteriorated. She realised she was nearing death and put her affairs in order. Her papers, letters, memoirs, and notebooks were burned. She wrote a new will, and settled her funeral arrangements: she was to be buried in her native Brunswick in a tomb bearing the inscription &quot;Here lies Caroline, the Injured &quot;. She died at Brandenburgh House in Hammersmith at 10:25 p.m. on 7 August 1821 at the age of 53. Her physicians thought she had an intestinal obstruction, but she may have had cancer, and there were rumours at the time that she had been poisoned.

Afraid that a procession of the funeral bier through London could spark public unrest, Lord Liverpool decided the Queen&#x27;s cortège would avoid the city, passing to the north on the way to Harwich and Brunswick. The crowd accompanying the procession was incensed and blocked the intended route with barricades to force a new route through Westminster and London. The scene soon descended into chaos; the soldiers forming the honour guard opened fire and rode through the crowd with drawn sabres. People in the crowd threw cobblestones and bricks at the soldiers, and two members of the public—Richard Honey, a carpenter, and George Francis, a bricklayer—were killed. Eventually, Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Sir Robert Baker ordered that the official route be abandoned, and the cortège passed through the city. As a result, Baker was dismissed from office.

The final route (in heavy rain) took the following course: Hammersmith, Kensington (blocked), Kensington Gore (blocked), Hyde Park, Park Lane (blocked), return to Hyde Park where soldiers forced the gates open, Cumberland Gate (blocked), Edgware Road, Tottenham Court Road, Drury Lane, the Strand, and from there through the City of London, then by way of Romford and Chelmsford to Colchester. The coffin was kept overnight at St Peter&#x27;s Church, Colchester, where Caroline&#x27;s executors tried unsuccessfully to replace the official inscription plate with one including the phrase &quot;Injured Queen of England&quot;. The next day, the coffin was taken to the seaport of Harwich, and placed on a ship bound for Germany. Brunswick Cathedral is Caroline&#x27;s final resting place.

==Legacy==
The American historian Thomas W. Laqueur emphasises that the sordid royal squabble captivated all Britons:
: During much of 1820 the &quot;queen&#x27;s business&quot; captivated the nation. &quot;It was the only question I have ever known,&quot; wrote the radical critic William Hazlitt, &quot;that excited a thorough popular feeling. It struck its roots into the heart of the nation; it took possession of every house or cottage in the kingdom.&quot;

In 1822, the publishers of the newspaper &quot;John Bull&quot; were found guilty over a series of libels published in the Queen&#x27;s lifetime, including one that alluded to her as &quot;a shameless woman&quot;. It was alleged the libels had embittered the Queen and shortened her life.

Caroline was the subject of Richard Condon&#x27;s 1977 novel &quot;The Abandoned Woman.&quot; The story of the royal marriage and Caroline&#x27;s battle to be recognised as queen served as the basis for the 1996 BBC docudrama &quot;A Royal Scandal&quot; with Susan Lynch as Caroline and Richard E. Grant as George IV. The 2008 radio play &quot;The People&#x27;s Princess&quot;, with Alex Jennings as George IV and Rebecca Saire as Caroline, drew parallels with the marriage and divorce of Charles, Prince of Wales (later Charles III), and Diana, Princess of Wales. .

==Arms==

The royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom are impaled with her father&#x27;s arms as Duke of Brunswick. The arms were Quarterly of twelve, 1st, Or, a semé of hearts Gules, a lion rampant Azure (Lüneburg); 2nd, Gules, two lions passant guardant Or (Brunswick); 3rd, Azure, a lion rampant Argent crowned Or (Eberstein); 4th, Gules a lion rampant Or, within a border componé Argent and Azure (Homburg); 5th, Or, a lion rampant Gules crowned Azure (Diepholz); 6th, Gules, a lion rampant Or (Lauterberg); 7th, Per fess, in chief Or, two bears&#x27; paws erect Sable (Hoya), in the base a gyronny, Argent and Azure (Old Bruckhausen); 8th, Azure, an eagle displayed Argent, langued, beaked and membered Gules (Diepholz eagle); 9th, Chequy Argent and Gules (Hohnstein); 10th, Argent, a stag&#x27;s attire in bend Gules (Regenstein); 11th, Argent, a stag trippant Sable (Klettenberg); 12th, Argent, a stag&#x27;s attire in bend sinister Sable (Blankenburg).

As Princess of Wales she used the arms of her husband (the royal arms with a label of three points Argent) impaled with those of her father, the whole surmounted by a coronet of the heir apparent.

<text>A model is a person with a role either to display commercial products (notably fashion clothing in fashion shows) or to serve as an artist&#x27;s model.

Modelling (&quot;modeling&quot; in American English) entails using one&#x27;s body to represent someone else&#x27;s body or someone&#x27;s artistic imagination of a body. For example a woman modelling for shoes uses her foot to model the potential customers&#x27; feet. Modelling thus is different from posing for portrait photography, portrait painting, and distinct from other types of public performance, such as acting or dancing. Personal opinions are normally not expressed, and a model&#x27;s reputation and image are considered critical.

Types of modelling include: fine art, fashion, glamour, fitness, and body-part promotional modelling. Models are featured in various media formats, including books, magazines, films, newspapers, the Internet, and television. Fashion modelling is sometimes featured in reality TV shows (&quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;).

Celebrities, including actors, singers, sports personalities and reality TV stars, frequently participate in modelling contests, assignments, and contracts in addition to their regular work. Modelling often is a part-time activity.

==Artist&#x27;s models==

Artist&#x27;s models pose for any visual artist as part of the creative process. Artist&#x27;s models are often paid professionals who provide a reference or inspiration for a work of art that includes the human figure. The most common types of art created using models are figure drawing, figure painting, sculpture and photography, but almost any medium may be used. Although commercial motives dominate over aesthetics in illustration, its artwork commonly employs models. Models are most frequently employed for art classes or by informal groups of experienced artists who gather to share the expense of a model.

===History of fashion modelling===
====Early years====
In 14th-century Europe, fashion had been displayed in miniature form to (often royal) clients by fashion dolls, before the clothes were made in human size. 

Modelling as a profession was first established in 1853 by Charles Frederick Worth, the &quot;father of haute couture&quot;, when he asked his wife, Marie Vernet Worth, to model the potential clients for the clothes he designed. The term &quot;house model&quot; was coined to describe this type of work. Eventually, this became common practice for Parisian fashion houses. There were no standard physical measurement requirements for a model, and most designers would use women of varying sizes to demonstrate variety in their designs.

The modelling profession expanded to photo modelling with the development of fashion photography. Models remained fairly anonymous, and relatively poorly paid, until the late 1940s, when the world&#x27;s first three supermodels, Barbara Goalen, Bettina Graziani and Lisa Fonssagrives began commanding very large sums. During the 1940s and 1950s, Graziani was the most photographed woman in France and the undisputed queen of couture, while Fonssagrives appeared on over 200 &quot;Vogue&quot; covers; her name recognition led to the importance of &quot;Vogue&quot; in shaping the careers of fashion models. One of the most popular models during the 1940s was Jinx Falkenburg, who was paid $25 per hour, a large sum at the time; through the 1950s, Wilhelmina Cooper, Jean Patchett, Dovima, Dorian Leigh, Suzy Parker, Evelyn Tripp and Carmen Dell&#x27;Orefice also dominated fashion. Dorothea Church was among the first black models in the industry to gain recognition in Paris. However, these models were unknown outside the fashion community. Wilhelmina Cooper&#x27;s measurements were 38&quot;-24&quot;-36&quot; whereas Chanel Iman&#x27;s measurements are 32&quot;-23&quot;-33&quot;. In 1946, Ford Models was established by Eileen and Gerard Ford in New York, making it one of the oldest model agencies in the world.

====The 1960s and the beginning of the industry====

In the 1960s, the modelling world established modelling agencies. Throughout Europe, secretarial services acted as models&#x27; agents charging them weekly rates for their messages and bookings. For the most part, models were responsible for their own billing. In Germany, agents were not allowed to work for a percentage of a person&#x27;s earnings, so they referred to themselves as secretaries. Except for a few models travelling to Paris or New York, travelling was relatively unheard of for a model. Most models only worked in one market due to different labour laws governing modelling in various countries. In the 1960s, Italy had many fashion houses and fashion magazines but desperately needed models. Italian agencies often coerced models to return to Italy without work visas by withholding their pay. They would also pay their models in cash, which models would have to hide from customs agents. It was not uncommon for models staying in hotels such as La Louisiana in Paris or the Arena in Milan to have their hotel rooms raided by the police looking for their work visas. It was rumoured that competing agencies were behind the raids. This led many agencies to form worldwide chains; for example, the Marilyn Agency has branches in Paris and New York.

By the late 1960s, London was considered the best market in Europe due to its more organised and innovative approach to modelling. It was during this period that models began to become household names. Models such as Jean Shrimpton, Tania Mallet, Celia Hammond, Twiggy, and Penelope Tree dominated the London fashion scene and were well paid, unlike their predecessors. Twiggy became The Face of &#x27;66 at the age of 16. At this time, model agencies were not as restrictive about the models they represented, although it was uncommon for them to sign shorter models. Twiggy, who stood at with a 32&quot; bust and had a boy&#x27;s haircut, is credited with changing model ideals. At that time, she earned an hour, while the average wage was a week.
In 1967, seven of the top model agents in London formed the Association of London Model Agents. The formation of this association helped legitimise modelling and changed the fashion industry. Even with a more professional attitude towards modelling, models were still expected to have their hair and makeup done before they arrived at a shoot. Meanwhile, agencies took responsibility for a model&#x27;s promotional materials and branding. That same year, former top fashion model Wilhelmina Cooper opened up her own fashion agency with her husband called Wilhelmina Models. By 1968, FM Agency and Models 1 were established and represented models in a similar way that agencies do today. By the late 1960s, models were treated better and were making better wages. One of the innovators, Ford Models, was the first agency to advance models money they were owed and would often allow teen models, who did not live locally, to reside in their house, a precursor to model housing.

====The 1970s and 1980s====
The innovations of the 1960s flowed into the 1970s fashion scene. As a result of model industry associations and standards, model agencies became more business minded, and more thought went into a model&#x27;s promotional materials. By this time, agencies were starting to pay for a model&#x27;s publicity. In the early 1970s, Scandinavia had many tall, leggy, blonde-haired, blue-eyed models and not enough clients. It was during this time that Ford Models pioneered scouting. They would spend time working with agencies holding modeling contests. This was the precursor to the Ford Models Supermodel of the World competition, established in 1980. Ford also focused its attention on Brazil, which had a wide array of seemingly &quot;exotic&quot; models, which eventually led to the establishment of Ford Models Brazil. During this time, the &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot; debuted. The magazine set the trend by photographing &quot;bigger and healthier&quot; California models, and printing their names by their photos, thus turning many of them into household names and establishing the issue as a hallmark of supermodel status.
The 1970s marked numerous milestones in fashion. Beverly Johnson was the first black woman to appear on the cover of U.S. &quot;Vogue&quot; in 1974. Models, including Iman, Grace Jones, Pat Cleveland, Alva Chinn, Donyale Luna, Minah Bird, Naomi Sims, and Toukie Smith were some of the top black fashion models who paved the way for black women in fashion. In 1975, Margaux Hemingway landed a then-unprecedented million-dollar contract as the face of Fabergé&#x27;s Babe perfume and the same year appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, labeled one of the &quot;New Beauties&quot;, giving further name recognition to fashion models.

Many of the world&#x27;s most prominent modeling agencies were established in the 1970s and early 1980s. These agencies created the standard by which agencies now run. In 1974, Nevs Models was established in London with only a men&#x27;s board, the first of its kind. Elite Models was founded in Paris in 1975, as well as Friday&#x27;s Models in Japan. The next year Cal-Carries was established in Singapore, the first of a chain of agencies in Asia. In 1977, Select Model Management and Why Not Models in Milan opened its doors. By the 1980s, agencies such as Premier Model Management, Storm Models, Mikas, Marilyn, and Metropolitan Models had been established.
In October 1981, &quot;Life&quot; cited Shelley Hack, Lauren Hutton and Iman for Revlon, Margaux Hemingway for Fabergé, Karen Graham for Estée Lauder, Cristina Ferrare for Max Factor, and Cheryl Tiegs for CoverGirl by proclaiming them the &quot;million dollar faces&quot; of the beauty industry. These models negotiated previously unheard-of lucrative and exclusive deals with giant cosmetics companies, were instantly recognizable, and their names became well known to the public.

By the 1980s, most models could make modeling a full-time career. Patti Hansen, one of the top earning models in 1980, earned $200 an hour for print and $2,000 for television plus residuals; it was estimated that she earned about $300,000 a year in 1980 (equivalent to $ in ). It was common for models to travel abroad and work throughout Europe. As modeling became global, numerous agencies began to think globally. In 1980, Ford Models, the innovator of scouting, introduced the Ford Models Supermodel of the World contest. That same year, John Casablancas opened Elite Models in New York. In 1981, cosmetics companies began contracting top models to lucrative endorsement deals. By 1983, Elite had developed its own contest, the Elite Model Look competition. In New York, during the 1980s there were so-called &quot;model wars&quot; in which the Ford and Elite agencies fought over models and campaigns. Models were jumping back and forth between agencies such Elite, Wilhelmina, and Ford. In New York, the late 1980s trend was the boyish look in which models had short cropped hair and looked androgynous. In Europe, the trend was the exact opposite. During this time, many American models who were considered more feminine-looking moved abroad. By the mid-1980s, big hair was made popular by some musical groups, and the boyish look was out. The hourglass figure, a fashionable trend from the late 1940s to the early 1960s, has made a comeback.

====1990s====

The high fashion models of the late 1980s dominated the early 1990s. In 1990, Linda Evangelista famously said to &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;we don&#x27;t wake up for less than $10,000 a day&quot;. Evangelista and her contemporaries, Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford, Christy Turlington, Tatjana Patitz, Stephanie Seymour, and Yasmeen Ghauri became arguably the most recognisable models in the world, earning the moniker of &quot;supermodel&quot;, and were boosted to global recognition and new heights of wealth for the industry. In 1991, Turlington signed a contract with Maybelline that paid her $800,000 for twelve days&#x27; work each year.

By the mid‑1990s, the new &quot;heroin chic&quot; trend became popular amongst New York and London editorial clients. Kate Moss became its poster child through her ads for Calvin Klein. With the popularity of lingerie retailer Victoria&#x27;s Secret, and the &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot;, there was a need for healthier-looking supermodels such as Tyra Banks and Heidi Klum to meet commercial modelling demand. The mid‑1990s also saw many Asian countries establishing modelling agencies.

By the late 1990s, the heroin chic era had run its course. Teen-inspired clothing infiltrated mainstream fashion, teen pop music was on the rise, and artists such as Britney Spears, Aaliyah and Christina Aguilera popularised pleather and bare midriffs. As fashion changed to a more youthful demographic, the models who rose to fame had to be sexier for the digital age. Following Gisele Bündchen&#x27;s breakthrough, a wave of Brazilian models including Adriana Lima and Alessandra Ambrosio rose to fame on runways and became popular in commercial modelling throughout the 2000s. Some have tied this increase in Brazilian models to the trend of magazines featuring celebrities instead of models on their covers.

====2000s and since====
In the late 2000s, the Brazilians fell out of favour on the runways. Editorial clients were favouring models with a china-doll or alien look to them, such as Gemma Ward and Lily Cole. During the 2000s, Ford Models and NEXT Model Management were engaged in a legal battle, with each agency alleging that the other was stealing its models.
However, the most significant controversy of the 2000s was the health of high-fashion models participating in fashion week. While the health of models had been a concern since the 1970s, there were several high-profile news stories surrounding the deaths of young fashion models due to eating disorders and drug abuse. The British Fashion Council subsequently asked designers to sign a contract stating they would not use models under the age of sixteen. On March 3, 2012, &quot;Vogue&quot; banned models under the age of sixteen as well as models who appeared to have an eating disorder. Similarly, other countries placed bans on unhealthy, and underage models, including Spain, Italy, Israel and France, which all enacted a minimum body mass index (BMI) requirement. The French law also requires digitally altered pictures of models to be identified as such.

In 2013, New York toughened its child labour law protections for models under the age of eighteen by passing New York Senate Bill No. 5486, which gives underage models the same labour protections afforded to child actors. Key new protections included the following: underage models are not to work before 5:00 pm or after 10:00 pm on school nights, nor were they to work later than 12:30 am on non-school nights; the models may not return to work less than twelve hours after they leave; a pediatric nurse must be on-site; an adult chaperone must accompany models under sixteen; parents or guardians of underage models must create a trust fund account into which employers will transfer a minimum of 15% of the child model&#x27;s gross earnings; and employers must set aside time and a dedicated space for educational instruction.

===Runway modelling===

Catwalk or runway models display clothes from fashion designers, fashion media, and consumers. They are also called &quot;live models&quot; and are self-employed. Their height is generally over for men and over for women. Runway models work in different locations, constantly travelling between those cities where fashion is well known—New York City, London, Paris, and Milan. Second-tier international fashion centre cities include Rome, Florence, Venice, Brescia, Barcelona, Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Moscow.

The criteria for runway models include certain height and weight requirements. During runway shows, models have to constantly change clothes and makeup. Models walk, turn, and stand to demonstrate a garment&#x27;s key features. Models also go to interviews (called &quot;go and sees&quot;) to present their portfolios. The more experience a model has, the more likely she/he is to be hired for a fashion show. A runway model can also work in other areas, such as department store fashion shows, and the most successful models sometimes create their own product lines or go into acting.

The British Association of Model Agents (AMA) says that female models should be around 34&quot;-24&quot;-34&quot; and between and tall. The average model is very slender. Those not meeting the size requirement may try to become a plus-size model. According to the New York Better Business Career Services website, the preferred dimensions for a male model are a height of to , a waist of and a chest measurement of . Male runway models are notably skinny and well toned.

Male and female models must also possess clear skin, healthy hair, and attractive facial features. Stringent weight and body proportion guidelines form the selection criteria by which established, and would‑be, models are judged for their placement suitability, on an ongoing basis. There can be some variation regionally, and by market tier, subject to current prevailing trends at any point, in any era, by agents, agencies and end-clients.

Formerly, the required measurements for models were 35&quot;-23.5&quot;-35&quot; in (90-60-90 cm), the alleged measurements of Marilyn Monroe. Today&#x27;s fashion models tend to have measurements closer to the AMA-recommended shape, but some – such as Afghan model Zohre Esmaeli – still have 35&quot;-23.5&quot;-35&quot; measurements. Although in some fashion centres, a size 00 is more desirable than a size 0.

The often thin shape of many fashion models has been criticised for warping girls&#x27; body image and encouraging eating disorders. Organisers of a fashion show in Madrid in September 2006 turned away models who were judged to be underweight by medical personnel who were on hand. In February 2007 a Uruguayan model, Luisel Ramos, died from heart problems secondary to malnutrition. Her sister Eliana Ramos also was a model and had died immediately after a runway show several months prior. They were amongst the three fashion models to die of malnutrition in a six-month span. The other victim was Ana Carolina Reston. Luisel Ramos died of heart failure caused by anorexia nervosa just after stepping off the catwalk. In 2015, France passed a law requiring models to be declared healthy by a doctor to participate in fashion shows. The law also requires re-touched images to be marked as such in magazines.

===Magazine modelling===

Fashion modelling also includes modelling clothing in fashion magazines. In Japan, there are different types of fashion magazine models. are models who regularly appear in a fashion magazine and model exclusively for it. On the other hand, street models, or , are amateur models who model part-time for fashion magazines in conjunction to school work and their main jobs. Unlike professional models, street models are meant to represent the average person in appearance and do not appear on runways. Street models are not exclusively contracted to fashion magazines. If a street model is popular enough, some become exclusive models. Many fashion icons and musicians in Japan began their careers as street models, including Kaela Kimura and Kyary Pamyu Pamyu.

===Plus-size===

Plus-size models are models who generally have larger measurements than editorial fashion models, and are not necessarily overweight. The primary use of plus-size models is to appear in advertising and runway shows for plus-size labels. Plus-size models are also engaged in work not strictly related to selling large-sized clothing, e.g., stock photography and advertising photography for cosmetics, household and pharmaceutical products and sunglasses, footwear and watches. Therefore, plus-size models do not exclusively wear garments marketed as plus-size clothing. This is especially true when participating in fashion editorials for mainstream fashion magazines. Some plus-size models have appeared in runway shows and campaigns for mainstream retailers and designers such as Gucci, Guess, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Levi&#x27;s and Versace Jeans.

===Normal-size===

Also known as the &quot;in-between&quot; and &quot;middle models&quot;, they are neither considered catalogue size (0–2) nor plus-size (10 up). There is criticism that these models have been left out of the conversation because fashion companies and brands opt to employ the extremes of the spectrum.

Model Camille Kostek who was on a solo cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Swimsuit Issue in 2019 has stated that she was told by a well-known international modelling agency &quot;...that it was too bad that I wasn&#x27;t a size 10. That plus size is a big market right now and it&#x27;s too bad I wasn&#x27;t measuring bigger. My size (4/6) is considered an &quot;in-between size&quot;, meaning I&#x27;m not a straight model nor plus model, I&#x27;m right in the middle. Actress Mindy Kaling has described this body type in her 2011 book &quot;Is Everybody Hanging Out Without Me?&quot; writing, &quot;Since I am not model-skinny, but also not super-fat... I fall into that nebulous, &#x27;Normal American Woman Size&#x27; that legions of fashion stylists detest... Many stylists hate that size because, I think, to them, I lack the self-discipline to be an aesthetic, or the sassy confidence to be a total fatty hedonist. They&#x27;re like, &#x27;Pick a lane.&#x27;&quot;

===Black models===
The arrival of black women modelling as a profession began in early postwar America. It started most notably from the need of advertisers and a rise of black photography magazines. The women who advanced in such careers were those in a middle-class system emphasising the conservative value of marriage, motherhood, and domesticity. Originally titled the &quot;Brownskin&quot; model, black women refined the social, sexual, and racial realities confined in the gender expectations of the modelling world. There was a profound need for black women to partake in the advertising process for the new &quot;Negro Market&quot;. With the help of Branford Models, the first black agency, 1946 was the beginning of the black modelling era. Branford Models&#x27; was able to &quot;overturn the barriers facing African Americans in the early postwar period,&quot; especially by lifting at least one economic freedom. In this postwar America, the demand for such presence in magazines advanced &quot;as a stage for models to display consumer goods&quot; while assisting &quot;in constructing a new visual discourse of urban middle-class African America&quot;. In March 1966, Donyale Luna became the African-American model to appear on the cover of the British edition of &quot;Vogue&quot;.

While they represented diversity, a major gap in the fashion industry, it was only until the 1970s that black models had a substantial presence in the modelling world. Known as the &quot;Black is Beautiful&quot; movement, the 1970s became the era of the black model. With growing disenfranchisement and racial inequality, the United States recognised the urgency of opening the &quot;doors of social access and visibility to black Americans&quot;. The world of fashion was the gateway for social change. &quot;The world of fashion was similarly looked to as a place where the culture could find signs of racial progress. Expressions of beauty and glamour mattered. Good race relations required taking note of who was selling women lipsticks and mini skirts, which meant that advertisers began looking for black models&quot; Black models were looked to as the vehicle of social change. They were given the opportunity to balance out the lack of presence of black individuals in the mainstream culture. Agencies were beginning to scout black models and focus on the social change they were contributing to. &quot;Life&quot; magazine in October 1969, covered their issue with Naomi Sims, one of the most influential black models in the industry. Her rise to fame led to her being hired by international magazines and working on individual projects with designers across the globe. In the Life Magazine issue, Black Beauty, a new agency that represented black models, had a spread in the magazine that showcased 39 black models. Each one of the models had unique features, allowing black expression to progress through this historic magazine spread.

With the movement&#x27;s presence both in magazines and on the runway, designers began to realise the need to include black models on their runways and advertisements. The Battle of Versailles was one of the most notable moments in fashion history that put black models on the map. Eleanor Lambert, creator of Fashion Week and a major &quot;[controller] of the narrative of American fashion&quot;, set up a dinner and a fundraiser to both increase American fashion visibility and restore the palace of Versailles. Five French designers and five American designers battled it out on the runway, showing off the fashion, and for the Americans, black models as well. Oscar de la Renta stated &quot;it was the black models that had made the difference.&quot; Pat Cleveland, Bethann Hardiason, Billie Blair, Jennifer Brice, Alva Chinn, and Ramona Saunders, were among the many black models that helped Team America win and stun the French competition. This competition made the black model a worldwide phenomenon. The French were beginning to welcome diversity on the runway and in their advertising. With the recognition Versailles had given, black presence in the modelling world carried out into the 1980s and the 1990s. The models were now known by name and the publicity that came with the designers they were modelling for. With the rise of the supermodel, models like Naomi Campbell and Tyra Banks paved the way for black success. Naomi Campbell, born in London, was the first black model to cover American Vogue, TIME magazine, Russian Vogue, and the first British black model to cover British vogue. Brands like Chanel, Louis Vitton, Balmain, Prada, and more have all featured Campbell in their campaigns. She used her remarkable success to achieve more than fashion excellence.

By the mid-1990s, black presence in the modelling world had dramatically decreased. Designers began to favour a consistent aesthetic and elected for skinnier white models. This reality was paved by models such as Kate Moss and Stella Tennant, who provided a more consistent look for the runway. At this time, &quot;the number of working black models in high-profile runway presentation... became so dire that stories began appearing in the mainstream media about the whitewashing of the runway&quot;. In response, models like Campbell, Iman, and Bethann Hardison, joined forces throughout the&quot;Diversity Coalition&quot; in an attempt to &quot;call out and accuse prominent fashion houses for snubbing Black and Asian models on the catwalk, editorial spreads, and campaigns&quot;. The lack of representation was, in part, due to the belief that &quot;black girls don&#x27;t push products&quot;, which &quot;encouraged people who work directly and indirectly in the industry to speak out on the injustices that go on within it&quot;. In the 1990s, it was quite clear that the top designers simply preferred a new aesthetic that excluded models of colour, which resulted in only 6% of runway models to be women of colour. Campbell&#x27;s Diversity Coalition&#x27;s primary mission was to &quot;expedite inclusion on the runway by deliberately calling out designers who have executed acts of racism on the runway&quot;. According to Campbell, it was their choice to not include black models on the runway and desire a uniformed runway that resulted in a racist act. Although such a dramatic effort to exclude black presence from the fashion world, models like Tyra Banks and Veronica Webb persisted. Banks not only dominated the runway as a teen, she took over countless pop culture platforms. Being the first black model to cover Sports Illustrated, Banks was one of the most prominent models in the early 2000s. Covering &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;Essence&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, and walking for Chanel, Chrisitan Dior, and Claude Monanta, Banks was truly dominating the fashion world. In addition, she acted in &quot;Fresh Prince of Bel Air&quot; and created her own reality competition show called America&#x27;s Next Top Model. In conversation with Trebay of Los the New York Times, Banks stated that her first cover on Sports Illustrated &quot;changed [her] life overnight. You have to think back to remember what that did for an appreciation of black beauty to have a black girl, a girl next door type, on the cover of one of the most mass mainstream magazines of our lives. It was a societal statement, a political statement, and an economic one&quot;. Now, models like Joan Smalls, Winne Harlow, Slick Woods, Jasmine Sanders and more are continuing the fight for black presence in the modelling world and using their successors as inspiration.

===Fitting models===

A fit model (sometimes fitting model) is a person who is used by a fashion designer or clothing manufacturer to check the fit, drape and visual appearance of a design on a representative human being, effectively acting as a live mannequin.

===Parts models===
Some models are employed for their body parts. For example, hand models may be used to promote products held in the hand and nail-related products. (e.g. rings, other jewelry or nail polish). They are frequently part of television commercials. Many parts models have exceptionally attractive body parts, but there is also demand for unattractive or unusual looking body parts for particular campaigns.

Hands are the most in-demand body parts. Feet models are also in high demand, particularly those that fit sample-size shoes. Models are also successful modelling other specific parts including abs, arms, back, bust or chest, legs, and lips. Some petite models (females who are under and do not qualify as fashion models) have found success in women&#x27;s body part modelling.

Parts model divisions can be found at agencies worldwide. Several agencies solely represent parts models, including Hired Hands in London, Body Parts Models in Los Angeles, Carmen Hand Model Management in New York and Parts Models in New York. Parts Models is the largest parts agency, representing over 300 parts models.

===Petite models===
Petite models are models that are under the typical height requirements that are expected of fashion models. Petite models typically work more often in commercial and print modelling (rather than runway modelling).

The height of models is typically and above for women, and and above for men. Models who are shorter than these heights usually fall under the category of petite or commercial models.

===Podium models===

Podium models differ from runway models in that they do not walk down a runway, but rather just stand on an elevated platform. They resemble live mannequins placed in various places throughout an event. Attendees can walk up to the models and inspect and even feel the clothing. Podium Modelling is a practical alternative way of presenting a fashion show when space is too limited to have a full runway fashion show.

===Earnings and demographics===
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics the median earnings for a model in the United States, as of 2021, is $34,000 annually. There are approximately 3,200 men and women who work as models full-time in the United States.

==Glamour models==
Glamour modelling focuses on sexuality; thus, general requirements are often unclear, depending more on each case. Glamour models can be any size or shape. A study from 2014 that analysed glamour model profiles estimated that the mean values of female models were height, weight and 0.73 waist-to-hip ratio.

There is no industry standard for glamour modelling and it varies greatly by country. For the most part, glamour models are limited to modelling in calendars, men&#x27;s magazines, such as &quot;Playboy&quot;, bikini modelling, lingerie modelling, fetish modelling, music videos, and extra work in films. However, some extremely popular glamour models transition into commercial print modelling, appearing in swimwear, bikini and lingerie campaigns.

In the UK, glamour modelling became a prominent feature of the newspaper industry when &quot;The Sun&quot; established Page 3 in 1969, a section in their newspaper which featured sexually suggestive images of &quot;Penthouse&quot; and &quot;Playboy&quot; models. From 1970 models appeared topless. In the 1980s, &quot;The Sun&quot; competitors followed suit and produced their own Page 3 sections. It was during this time that glamour models first came to prominence with the likes of Samantha Fox. As a result, the United Kingdom has a very large glamour market and numerous glamour modelling agencies.

It was not until the 1990s that modern glamour modelling was established. During this time, the fashion industry was promoting models with waif bodies and androgynous-looking women, which left a void. Several fashion models, who were deemed too commercial, and too curvaceous, were frustrated with industry standards, and took a different approach. Models such as Victoria Silvstedt left the fashion world and began modelling for men&#x27;s magazines. In the previous decades, posing nude for &quot;Playboy&quot; resulted in models losing their agencies and endorsements. &quot;Playboy&quot; was a stepping stone which catapulted the careers of Victoria Silvstedt, Pamela Anderson, Jenny McCarthy, and Anna Nicole Smith. Pamela Anderson became so popular from her &quot;Playboy&quot; spreads that she was able to land roles on &quot;Home Improvement&quot; and &quot;Baywatch&quot;.

In the mid-1990s, a series of men&#x27;s magazines were established such as &quot;Maxim&quot;, &quot;FHM&quot;, and &quot;Stuff&quot;. At the same time, magazines including Sweden&#x27;s &quot;Slitz&quot; (formerly a music magazine) re-branded themselves as men&#x27;s magazines. Pre-internet, these magazines were popular among men in their late teens and early twenties because they were considered more tasteful than their predecessors. With the glamour market growing, fashion moved away from the waifs and onto Brazilian bombshells. The glamour market, consisting mostly of commercial fashion and print models, became its own genre due to its popularity. Even in a large market like the United Kingdom, however, glamour models are not usually signed exclusively to one agency as they can not rely financially on one agency to provide them with enough work. It was, and still is, a common practice for glamour models to partake in kiss-and-tell interviews about their dalliances with famous men. The notoriety of their alleged bed-hopping often propels their popularity and they are often promoted by their current or former fling. With Page 3 models becoming fixtures in the British tabloids, glamour models such as Jordan, now known as Katie Price, became household names. By 2004, Page 3 regulars earned anywhere from £30,000 to 40,000, where the average salary of a non-Page 3 model, as of 2011, was between £10,000 and 20,000. In the early 2000s, glamour models, and aspiring glamour models, appeared on reality television shows such as &quot;Big Brother&quot; to gain fame. Several &quot;Big Brother&quot; alumni parlayed their fifteen minutes of fame into successful glamour modelling careers. However, partly because of competition from the upcoming internet -giving audiences access to large amounts of, often free, online content- and its own glamour stars, such as Jordan Capri, the offline glamour market became saturated by the mid-2000s, and numerous men&#x27;s magazines including &quot;Arena&quot;, &quot;Stuff&quot; and &quot;FHM&quot; in the United States went under. During this time, there was a growing trend of glamour models, including Kellie Acreman and Lauren Pope, becoming DJs to supplement their income. In a 2012 interview, Keeley Hazell said that going topless is not the best way to achieve success and that &quot;[she] was lucky to be in that 1% of people that get that, and become really successful.&quot;

===Gravure idols===
In Japan, a , often abbreviated to , is a female model who primarily models for magazines, especially men&#x27;s magazines, photobooks or DVDs. It is considered part of the overall idol industry in Japan. is a wasei-eigo term derived from &quot;rotogravure&quot;, which is a type of intaglio printing process that was once a staple of newspaper photo features. The rotogravure process is still used for commercial printing of magazines, postcards, and cardboard product packaging.

Gravure idols appear in a wide range of photographic styles and genres. Their photos are largely aimed at male audiences with poses or activities intended to be provocative or suggestive, generally accentuated by an air of playfulness and innocence rather than aggressive sexuality. Although gravure idols may sometimes wear clothing that exposes most of their body, they seldom appear fully nude. Gravure idols may be as young as pre-teen age up to their early thirties. In addition to appearing in mainstream magazines, gravure idols often release their own professional photobooks and DVDs for their fans. Many popular female idols in Japan started their careers as gravure idols.

===Alternative models===
An alternative model is any model who does not fit into the conventional model types and may include punk, goth, fetish, and tattooed models or models with distinctive attributes. This type of modelling is usually a cross between glamour modelling and art modelling. Publishers such as Goliath Books in Germany introduced alternative models and punk photography to larger audiences. Billi Gordon, then known as Wilbert Anthony Gordon, was the top greeting card model in the world and inspired a cottage industry, including greeting cards, T-shirts, fans, stationery, gift bags, etc.

==Fitness models==
Fitness modelling focuses on displaying a healthy, toned physique. Fitness models usually have defined muscle groups. The model&#x27;s body weight is greater due to muscle being denser than fat; however, they have a lower body fat percentage and a higher degree of muscle definition. 

Fitness models are often used in magazine advertising; they can also in some cases be certified personal fitness trainers. However, other fitness models are also athletes and compete as professionals in fitness and figure competitions. 

There are several agencies in large markets such as New York, London, and Germany that have fitness modelling agencies. While there is a large market for these models, most of these agencies are secondary agencies promoting models who typically earn their primary income as commercial models. There are also magazines that are geared towards specifically fitness modelling or getting fit and in shape.

==Commercial models==
===Promotional models===
A promotional model is a model hired to drive consumer demand for a product, service, brand, or concept by interacting in person with potential consumers. The vast majority of promotional models tend to be attractive in physical appearance. They serve to provide information about the product or service and make it appealing to consumers. While the interaction length may be short, the promotional model delivers a live experience that reflects on the product or service he or she represents. This form of marketing touches fewer consumers for the cost than traditional advertising media (such as print, radio, and television); however, the consumer&#x27;s perception of a brand, product, service, or company is often more profoundly affected by a live person-to-person experience.

Marketing campaigns that make use of promotional models may take place in stores or shopping malls, at tradeshows, special promotional events, clubs, or even at outdoor public spaces. Promotional models may also be used as TV hosts/anchors for interviewing celebrities at film awards, sports events, etc. They are often held at high-traffic locations to reach as many consumers as possible or at venues where a particular type of target consumer is expected to be present.

====Spokesmodels====

&quot;Spokesmodel&quot; is a term used for a model who is employed to be associated with a specific brand in advertisements. A spokesmodel may be a celebrity used only in advertisements (in contrast to a brand ambassador who is also expected to represent the company at various events), but more often the term refers to a model who is not a celebrity in their own right. A classic example of the spokesmodel is the models hired to be the Marlboro Man between 1954 and 1999.

====Trade show models====
Trade show models work a trade show floorspace or booth and represent a company to attendees. Trade show models are typically not regular employees of the company, but are freelancers hired by the company renting the booth space. They are hired for several reasons: trade show models can make a company&#x27;s booth more visible from the hundreds of other booths competing for attendee attention. They are articulate and quickly learn and explain or disseminate information on the company and its product(s) and service(s). And they can assist a company in handling a large number of attendees, which the company might otherwise not have enough employees to accommodate, possibly increasing the number of sales or leads resulting from participation in the show.

====Atmosphere models====

Atmosphere models are hired by the producers of themed events to enhance the atmosphere or ambience of their event. They are usually dressed in costumes exemplifying the event&#x27;s theme and are often placed strategically in various locations around the venue. It is common for event guests to have their picture taken with atmosphere models. For example, if someone is throwing a &quot;Brazilian Day&quot; celebration, they would hire models dressed in samba costumes and headdresses to stand or walk around the party.

===Instagram models===
Instagram models are people who have accumulated a large number of followers on Instagram by posting engaging photos of themselves and their lifestyles, and are consequently hired by a company to advertise products as their influence and popularity can increase sales. They should not be confused with established models such as Cara Delevingne and Gigi Hadid, who use Instagram to promote their traditional modelling careers, although some models, such as Playboy model Lindsey Pelas, begin their careers conventionally and subsequently become Instagram models. Some models use Instagram success to develop their careers, such as Rosie Roff, who worked as a fashion model before being discovered via Instagram and gaining work as a ring girl in American boxing. In some cases, Instagram gives unsigned models a platform to attract the attention of agencies and talent scouts. American model Matthew Noszka entered the profession as a result of being discovered on Instagram by Wilhelmina Models.

The Instagram model concept originated in the late 2000s, when the boyfriends of fashion bloggers such as Rumi Neely and Chiara Ferragni began photographing their girlfriends in various outfits. Instagram models often attempt to become social media influencers and engage in influencer marketing, promoting products such as fashion brands and detox teas. High-profile influencers can earn thousands of dollars for promoting commercial brands. When choosing whom to employ, brands have become less concerned with the number of followers an influencer has and more focused on their engagement marketing strategy. Research indicates that 89% of influencers use Instagram to promote themselves, compared to 20% using Twitter and 16% using Facebook.

Some Instagram models have gained high-profile modelling jobs and become celebrities. Fitness model Jen Selter had become an Internet celebrity by 2014 and modelled for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine. Cosplayer and model Anna Faith acquired over 250,000 Instagram followers by 2014, gaining success from her ability to impersonate the Disney character Elsa. With Facebook&#x27;s continuing decrease in post reach, Instagram has increasingly become cosplayers&#x27; favourite platform. American actress Caitlin O&#x27;Connor had almost 300,000 Instagram followers in 2016, earning most of her social media income from endorsing products on Instagram. Australian personal trainer Kayla Itsines acquired 5.5 million Instagram followers, allowing her to build a business in the fitness industry. Brazilian model Claudia Alende gained a following of 2.8 million people on Instagram by 2015 and developed a career as a lingerie model. Plus-size models Iskra Lawrence and Tess Holliday have used Instagram to demonstrate their potential as models. Yashika Aannand, an Indian teenage actress, rose to prominence in the Tamil film industry after gaining popularity as an Instagram model with over 145,000 followers on her account by 2017. Iraqi cross-dressing model, Noor Alsaffar, was killed in September 2023 as part of an increase in violence against LGBTQ+ people.

Instagram model techniques and aesthetics have also been used in unconventional or parody profiles. Instagram model Lil Miquela has blurred the line between reality and social media, amassing more than 200,000 followers without revealing whether she is real or computer-generated. Australian comedian Celeste Barber had acquired 1.8 million Instagram followers by 2017, parodying celebrity fashion photographs with real-life reenactments. In 2016, French organisation Addict Aide ran a campaign to raise awareness for alcohol abuse among young people in which a model posed as Louise Delage, a fictitious 25-year-old Parisian whose Instagram photos nearly always featured alcohol. The account amassed 65,000 followers in a month, after which a reveal video posted to it had over 160,000 views.

Some reports suggest that a number of Instagram models obtain extra income by covertly working as prostitutes. Websites accusing various models of this, often without reliable evidence, have increased in popularity recently, sometimes with the unintended effect of increasing their earnings. But false accusations on these sites can harm legitimate models&#x27; reputations, and some women in the industry consider them a way for men to exert power over women.

<doc id="48918" wikidata="Q152260" url="?curid=48918" title="Alexandra of Denmark">
<text>Alexandra of Denmark (Alexandra Caroline Marie Charlotte Louise Julia; 1 December 1844 – 20 November 1925) was Queen of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions, and Empress of India, from 22 January 1901 to 6 May 1910 as the wife of Edward VII.

Alexandra&#x27;s family had been relatively obscure until 1852, when her father, Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, was chosen with the consent of the major European powers to succeed his second cousin Frederick VII as King of Denmark. At the age of sixteen, Alexandra was chosen as the future wife of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, the son and heir apparent of Queen Victoria. The couple married eighteen months later in 1863, the year in which her father became king of Denmark as Christian IX and her brother William was appointed king of Greece as George I. 

Alexandra was Princess of Wales from 1863 to 1901, the longest anyone has ever held that title, and became generally popular; her style of dress and bearing were copied by fashion-conscious women. Largely excluded from wielding any political power, she unsuccessfully attempted to sway the opinion of British ministers and her husband&#x27;s family to favour Greek and Danish interests. Her public duties were restricted to uncontroversial involvement in charitable work.

On the death of Queen Victoria in 1901, Albert Edward became King-Emperor as Edward VII, with Alexandra as queen-empress. She became queen mother on Edward VII&#x27;s death in 1910, at which point their son George V acceded to the throne. Alexandra died aged 80 in 1925.

==Early life==
Princess Alexandra Caroline Marie Charlotte Louise Julia, or &quot;Alix&quot;, as her immediate family knew her, was born at the Yellow Palace, an 18th-century town house at 18 Amaliegade, immediately adjacent to the Amalienborg Palace complex in Copenhagen. Her father was Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and her mother was Princess Louise of Hesse-Kassel. She had five siblings: Frederick, William (later George I of Greece), Dagmar (later Empress of Russia), Thyra and Valdemar.

Her father&#x27;s family was a distant cadet branch of the Danish royal House of Oldenburg, which was descended from King Christian III. Although they were of royal blood, the family lived a comparatively modest life. They did not possess great wealth; her father&#x27;s income from an army commission was about £800 per year, and their house was a rent-free grace and favour property. Occasionally, Hans Christian Andersen was invited to call and tell the children stories before bedtime.

In 1848, Christian VIII of Denmark died and his only son Frederick acceded to the throne. Frederick was childless, had been through two unsuccessful marriages, and was assumed to be infertile. A succession crisis arose because Frederick ruled in both Denmark and Schleswig-Holstein, and the succession rules of each territory differed. In Holstein, the Salic law prevented inheritance through the female line, whereas no such restrictions applied in Denmark. Holstein, being predominantly German, proclaimed independence and called in the aid of Prussia. In 1852, the major European powers called a conference in London to discuss the Danish succession. An uneasy peace was agreed, which included the provision that Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg would be Frederick&#x27;s heir in all his dominions and the prior claims of others (who included Christian&#x27;s own mother-in-law, brother-in-law and wife) were surrendered.
Prince Christian was given the title Prince of Denmark and his family moved into a new official residence, Bernstorff Palace. Although the family&#x27;s status had risen, there was little or no increase in their income; and they did not participate in court life at Copenhagen, for they refused to meet Frederick&#x27;s third wife and former mistress, Louise Rasmussen, because she had an illegitimate child by a previous lover. 

Alexandra shared a draughty attic bedroom with her sister, Dagmar, made her own clothes, and waited at table along with her sisters. Alexandra and Dagmar were given swimming lessons by the Swedish pioneer of women&#x27;s swimming, Nancy Edberg. At Bernstorff, Alexandra grew into a young woman; she was taught English by the English chaplain at Copenhagen and was confirmed in Christiansborg Palace. She was devout throughout her life, and followed high church practice.

==Marriage and family==

Given that Albert Edward, the Prince of Wales, would reach the age of twenty in November 1861, his parents Queen Victoria and her husband, Prince Albert, were taking steps to find a bride for him. They enlisted the aid of their eldest (and already-married) daughter, Crown Princess Victoria of Prussia, in seeking a suitable candidate. Alexandra was not their first choice because the Danes were at loggerheads with the Prussians over the Schleswig-Holstein Question, and most of the British royal family&#x27;s relations were German. Eventually, after rejecting other possibilities, they settled on her as &quot;the only one to be chosen&quot;.

On 24 September 1861, Crown Princess Victoria introduced her brother Albert Edward to Alexandra at Speyer. Almost a year later on 9 September 1862 (after his affair with Nellie Clifden and the death of his father Prince Albert), Albert Edward proposed to Alexandra at the Royal Castle of Laeken, the home of his great-uncle, King Leopold I of Belgium.

A few months later, Alexandra travelled from Denmark to Britain aboard the royal yacht &quot;Victoria and Albert&quot; and arrived in Gravesend, Kent, on 7 March 1863. Sir Arthur Sullivan composed music for her arrival and Poet Laureate Alfred, Lord Tennyson, wrote an ode in Alexandra&#x27;s honour:

Thomas Longley, the Archbishop of Canterbury, married the couple on 10 March 1863 at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle. The choice of venue was criticised. As the ceremony took place outside London, the press complained that large public crowds would not be able to view the spectacle. Prospective guests thought it awkward to get to and, as the venue was small, some people who had expected invitations were disappointed. The Danes were dismayed because only Alexandra&#x27;s closest relations were invited. The British court was still in mourning for Prince Albert, so ladies were restricted to wearing grey, lilac, or mauve. As the couple left Windsor for their honeymoon at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, they were cheered by the schoolboys of neighbouring Eton College, including Lord Randolph Churchill.

By the end of the following year, Alexandra&#x27;s father had acceded to the throne of Denmark, her brother William had become King George I of Greece, her sister Dagmar was engaged to Nicholas Alexandrovich, Tsesarevich of Russia, and Alexandra had given birth to her first child. Her father&#x27;s accession gave rise to further conflict over the fate of Schleswig-Holstein. The German Confederation successfully invaded Denmark, reducing the area of Denmark by two-fifths. To the great irritation of Queen Victoria and the Crown Princess of Prussia, Alexandra and Albert Edward supported the Danish side in the war. The Prussian conquest of former Danish lands heightened Alexandra&#x27;s profound dislike of the Germans, a feeling which stayed with her for the rest of her life.

Alexandra&#x27;s first child, Albert Victor, was born two months premature in early 1864. Alexandra showed devotion to her children: &quot;She was in her glory when she could run up to the nursery, put on a flannel apron, wash the children herself and see them asleep in their little beds.&quot; Albert Edward and Alexandra had six children in total: Albert Victor, George, Louise, Victoria, Maud, and Alexander. All of Alexandra&#x27;s children were apparently born prematurely; biographer Richard Hough thought Alexandra deliberately misled Queen Victoria as to her probable delivery dates, as she did not want the Queen to be present at their births. During the birth of her third child in 1867, the added complication of a bout of rheumatic fever threatened Alexandra&#x27;s life and left her with a permanent limp.

In public, Alexandra was dignified and charming; in private, affectionate and jolly. She enjoyed many social activities, including dancing and ice-skating, and was an expert horsewoman and tandem driver. She also enjoyed hunting, to the dismay of Queen Victoria, who asked her to stop, but without success. Even after the birth of her first child, she continued to socialise much as before, which led to some friction between the Queen and the young couple, exacerbated by Alexandra&#x27;s loathing of Prussians and the Queen&#x27;s partiality towards them.

==Princess of Wales==

Albert Edward and Alexandra visited Ireland in April 1868. After her illness the previous year, she had only just begun to walk again without the aid of two walking sticks, and was already pregnant with her fourth child. The royal couple undertook a six-month tour taking in Austria, Egypt and Greece over 1868 and 1869, which included visits to her brother George I of Greece, to the Crimean battlefields and, for her only, to the harem of the Khedive Ismail. In Turkey she became the first woman to sit down to dinner with the Sultan (Abdulaziz).

The Waleses made Sandringham House their preferred residence, with Marlborough House their London base. Biographers agree that their marriage was in many ways a happy one; however, some have asserted that Albert Edward did not give his wife as much attention as she would have liked and that they gradually became estranged, until his attack of typhoid fever (the disease which was believed to have killed his father) in late 1871 brought about a reconciliation. This is disputed by others, who point out Alexandra&#x27;s frequent pregnancies throughout this period and use family letters to deny the existence of any serious rift. Nevertheless, the prince was severely criticised from many quarters of society for his apparent lack of interest in her very serious illness with rheumatic fever. Throughout their marriage Albert Edward continued to keep company with other women, including the actress Lillie Langtry, Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick, humanitarian Agnes Keyser, and society matron Alice Keppel. Alexandra knew about most of these relationships and later permitted Alice Keppel to visit her husband as he lay dying. Alexandra herself remained faithful throughout her marriage.

An increasing degree of deafness, caused by hereditary otosclerosis, led to Alexandra&#x27;s social isolation; she spent more time at home with her children and pets. Her sixth and final pregnancy ended with the birth of a son in April 1871, but the infant died the next day. Despite Alexandra&#x27;s pleas for privacy, Queen Victoria insisted on announcing a period of court mourning, which led unsympathetic elements of the press to describe the birth as &quot;a wretched abortion&quot; and the funeral arrangements as &quot;sickening mummery&quot;, even though the infant was not buried in state with other members of the royal family at Windsor, but in strict privacy in the churchyard at Sandringham, where he had lived out his brief life.

For eight months over 1875–76, the Prince of Wales was absent from Britain on a tour of India, but to her dismay Alexandra was left behind. The prince had planned an all-male group and intended to spend much of the time hunting and shooting. During the prince&#x27;s tour, one of his friends who was travelling with him, Lord Aylesford, was told by his wife that she was going to leave him for another man, Lord Blandford, who was himself married. Aylesford was appalled and decided to seek a divorce.

Meanwhile, Lord Blandford&#x27;s brother, Lord Randolph Churchill, persuaded the lovers against an elopement. Now concerned by the threat of divorce, Lady Aylesford sought to dissuade her husband from proceeding, but Lord Aylesford was adamant and refused to reconsider. In an attempt to pressure Lord Aylesford to drop his divorce suit, Lady Aylesford and Lord Randolph Churchill called on Alexandra and told her that if the divorce was to proceed they would subpoena her husband as a witness and implicate him in the scandal. Distressed at their threats, and following the advice of Sir William Knollys and the Duchess of Teck, Alexandra informed the Queen, who then wrote to the Prince of Wales. The prince was incensed. Eventually, the Blandfords and the Aylesfords both separated privately. Although Lord Randolph Churchill later apologised, for years afterwards the Prince of Wales refused to speak to or see him.

Alexandra spent the spring of 1877 in Greece recuperating from a period of ill health and visiting her brother King George of Greece. During the Russo-Turkish War, Alexandra was clearly partial against Turkey and towards Russia, where her sister was married to the Tsarevitch, and she lobbied for a revision of the border between Greece and Turkey in favour of the Greeks. Alexandra spent the next three years largely parted from her two sons as the boys were sent on a worldwide cruise as part of their naval and general education. The farewell was very tearful and, as shown by her regular letters, she missed them terribly. In 1881, Alexandra and Albert Edward travelled to Saint Petersburg after the assassination of Alexander II of Russia, both to represent Britain and so that Alexandra could provide comfort to her sister, who had become tsarina.
Alexandra undertook many public duties; in the words of Queen Victoria, &quot;to spare me the strain and fatigue of functions. She opens bazaars, attends concerts, visits hospitals in my place ... she not only never complains, but endeavours to prove that she has enjoyed what to another would be a tiresome duty.&quot; She took a particular interest in the London Hospital, visiting it regularly. Joseph Merrick, the so-called &quot;Elephant Man&quot;, was one of the patients whom she met. Crowds usually cheered Alexandra rapturously, but during a visit to Ireland in 1885, she suffered a rare moment of public hostility when visiting the City of Cork, a hotbed of Irish nationalism. She and her husband were booed by a crowd of two to three thousand people brandishing sticks and black flags. She smiled her way through the ordeal, which the British press still portrayed in a positive light, describing the crowds as &quot;enthusiastic&quot;. As part of the same visit, she received a Doctorate in Music from Trinity College Dublin.

Alexandra was deeply saddened by the death of her eldest son, Prince Albert Victor, in 1892. His room and possessions were kept exactly as he had left them, much as those of his grandfather Prince Albert were left after his death in 1861. Alexandra said, &quot;I have buried my angel and with him my happiness.&quot; Surviving letters between Alexandra and her children indicate that they were mutually devoted. In 1894, her brother-in-law Alexander III of Russia died and her nephew Nicholas II of Russia became Tsar. Alexandra&#x27;s widowed sister, the Dowager Empress of Russia, leant heavily on her for support; Alexandra, who had gone to Russia accompanied by her husband, the Prince of Wales, slept, prayed, and stayed beside her sister for the next two weeks until Alexander&#x27;s burial. Alexandra and her husband stayed on for the wedding of Nicholas to their niece Princess Alix of Hesse and by Rhine, who had taken the Russian name Alexandra Feodorovna and became the new tsarina.

==Queen and empress consort==

With the death of her mother-in-law, Queen Victoria, in 1901, Alexandra became queen-empress with her husband&#x27;s accession as Edward VII. Just two months later, her son George and daughter-in-law Mary left on an extensive tour of the empire, leaving their young children in the care of Alexandra and Edward, who doted on their grandchildren. On George&#x27;s return, preparations for Edward and Alexandra&#x27;s coronation in Westminster Abbey were well in hand, but just a few days before the scheduled coronation in June 1902, the King became seriously ill with appendicitis. Alexandra deputised for him at a military parade and attended the Royal Ascot races without him, in an attempt to prevent public alarm. Eventually, the coronation had to be postponed and Edward had an operation performed by Frederick Treves of the London Hospital to drain the infected appendix. After his recovery, Alexandra and Edward were crowned together in August: the King by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple, and the Queen by the Archbishop of York, William Dalrymple Maclagan.
Despite being queen, Alexandra&#x27;s duties changed little, and she kept many of the same retainers. Alexandra&#x27;s Woman of the Bedchamber, Charlotte Knollys, the daughter of Sir William Knollys, served Alexandra loyally for many years. On 10 December 1903, Knollys woke to find her bedroom full of smoke. She roused Alexandra and shepherded her to safety. In the words of Grand Duchess Augusta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, &quot;We must give credit to old Charlotte for &quot;really&quot; saving [Alexandra&#x27;s] life.&quot;

Alexandra again looked after her grandchildren when George and Mary went on a second tour, this time to British India, over the winter of 1905–06. Her father, Christian IX of Denmark, died that January. Eager to retain their family links, both to each other and to Denmark, in 1907 Alexandra and her sister, the Dowager Empress of Russia, purchased a villa north of Copenhagen, Hvidøre, as a private getaway.

Alexandra was denied access to the King&#x27;s briefing papers and excluded from some of his foreign tours to prevent her meddling in diplomatic matters. She was deeply distrustful of Germans, particularly her nephew German Emperor Wilhelm II, and she invariably opposed anything that favoured German expansion or interests. For example, in 1890 Alexandra wrote a memorandum, distributed to senior British ministers and military personnel, warning against the planned exchange of the British North Sea island of Heligoland for the German colony of Zanzibar, pointing out Heligoland&#x27;s strategic significance and that it could be used either by Germany to launch an attack, or by Britain to contain German aggression. Despite this, the exchange went ahead. The Germans fortified the island and, in the words of Robert Ensor and as Alexandra had predicted, it &quot;became the keystone of Germany&#x27;s maritime position for offence as well as for defence&quot;. The &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot; was outspoken in its condemnation of Alexandra and her sister, the Dowager Empress, saying that the pair were &quot;the centre of the international anti-German conspiracy&quot;. Alexandra despised and distrusted Emperor Wilhelm, calling him &quot;inwardly our enemy&quot; in 1900.

In 1910, Alexandra became the first queen consort to visit the British House of Commons during a debate. In a remarkable departure from precedent, for two hours she sat in the Ladies&#x27; Gallery overlooking the chamber while the Parliament Bill, to remove the right of the House of Lords to veto legislation, was debated. Privately, Alexandra disagreed with the bill. Shortly afterwards, she left to visit her brother George in Corfu. While there, she received news that King Edward was seriously ill. Alexandra returned at once and arrived only the day before her husband died. In his last hours, she personally administered oxygen from a gas cylinder to help him breathe. She told Frederick Ponsonby, &quot;I feel as if I had been turned into stone, unable to cry, unable to grasp the meaning of it all.&quot; Later that year she moved out of Buckingham Palace to Marlborough House, but she retained possession of Sandringham. The new king, Alexandra&#x27;s son George V, soon faced a decision over the Parliament Bill. Despite her personal views, Alexandra supported her son&#x27;s reluctant agreement to Prime Minister H. H. Asquith&#x27;s request to create sufficient Liberal peers after a general election if the Lords continued to block the legislation.

==Queen mother==

From Edward&#x27;s death, Alexandra was queen mother, being a dowager queen and the mother of the reigning monarch. She did not attend the coronation of her son and daughter-in-law in 1911 since it was not customary for a crowned queen to attend the coronation of another king or queen, but otherwise continued the public side of her life, devoting time to her charitable causes. One such cause was Alexandra Rose Day, where artificial roses made by people with disabilities were sold in aid of hospitals by women volunteers. During the First World War the custom of hanging the banners of foreign princes invested with Britain&#x27;s highest order of knighthood, the Order of the Garter, in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, came under criticism, as the German members of the Order were fighting against Britain. Alexandra joined calls to &quot;have down those hateful German banners&quot;. Driven by public opinion, but against his own wishes, the King had the banners removed; but to Alexandra&#x27;s dismay, he had taken down not only &quot;those vile Prussian banners&quot; but also those of her Hessian relations who were, in her opinion, &quot;simply soldiers or vassals under that brutal German Emperor&#x27;s orders&quot;. On 17 September 1916, she was at Sandringham during a Zeppelin air raid, but far worse was to befall other members of her family. In Russia, her nephew Tsar Nicholas II was overthrown and he, his wife and their children were killed by revolutionaries. Alexandra&#x27;s sister, the Dowager Empress, was rescued from Russia in 1919 by and brought to England, where she lived for some time with Alexandra.

=== Last years and death ===
Alexandra retained a youthful appearance into her senior years, but during the war her age caught up with her. She took to wearing elaborate veils and heavy makeup, which was described by gossips as having her face &quot;enamelled&quot;. She made no more trips abroad, and her health worsened. In 1920, a blood vessel in her eye burst, leaving her with temporary partial blindness. Towards the end of her life, her memory and speech became impaired. She died on 20 November 1925 at Sandringham House from a heart attack. Queen Alexandra lay in state at Westminster Abbey and was interred on 28 November next to her husband in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle.

==Legacy==
The Queen Alexandra Memorial by Alfred Gilbert was unveiled on Alexandra Rose Day 8 June 1932 at Marlborough Gate, London. An ode in her memory, &quot;So many true princesses who have gone&quot;, composed by the then Master of the King&#x27;s Musick Sir Edward Elgar to words by the Poet Laureate John Masefield, was sung at the unveiling and conducted by the composer.

Alexandra was highly popular with the British public. Unlike her husband and mother-in-law, Alexandra was not castigated by the press. Funds that she helped to collect were used to buy a river launch, called &quot;Alexandra&quot;, to ferry the wounded during the Sudan campaign, and to fit out a hospital ship, named &quot;The Princess of Wales&quot;, to bring back wounded from the Boer War. During the Boer War, Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Imperial Military Nursing Service, later renamed Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Royal Army Nursing Corps, was founded under Royal Warrant.

Alexandra had little understanding of money. The management of her finances was left in the hands of her loyal comptroller, Sir Dighton Probyn VC, who undertook a similar role for her husband. In the words of her grandson, Edward VIII (later the Duke of Windsor), &quot;Her generosity was a source of embarrassment to her financial advisers. Whenever she received a letter soliciting money, a cheque would be sent by the next post, regardless of the authenticity of the mendicant and without having the case investigated.&quot; Though she was not always extravagant (she had her old stockings darned for re-use and her old dresses were recycled as furniture covers), she would dismiss protests about her heavy spending with a wave of a hand or by claiming that she had not heard.

Alexandra hid a small scar on her neck, which was probably the result of a childhood operation, by wearing choker necklaces and high necklines, setting fashions which were adopted for fifty years. Alexandra&#x27;s effect on fashion was so profound that society ladies even copied her limping gait, after her serious illness in 1867 left her with a stiff leg. This came to be known as the &quot;Alexandra limp&quot;. She used predominantly the London fashion houses; her favourite was Redfern&#x27;s, but she shopped occasionally at Doucet and Fromont of Paris.

Alexandra has been portrayed on television by Deborah Grant and Helen Ryan in &quot;Edward the Seventh&quot;, Ann Firbank in &quot;Lillie&quot;, Maggie Smith in &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot;, and Bibi Andersson in &quot;The Lost Prince&quot;. She was portrayed in film by Helen Ryan again in the 1980 film &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;, Sara Stewart in the 1997 film &quot;Mrs Brown&quot;, and Julia Blake in the 1999 film &quot;Passion&quot;. In a 1980 stage play by Royce Ryton, &quot;Motherdear&quot;, she was portrayed by Margaret Lockwood in her last acting role. Also, in 1907, the Royal Alexandra Theatre was built in Toronto, Canada, as North America&#x27;s first royal theatre. The venue was named after her, after a patent letter was granted by the King, her husband Edward VII.

<doc id="48921" wikidata="Q205842" url="?curid=48921" title="Aspen, Colorado">
<text>Aspen is the home rule city that is the county seat and the most populous municipality of Pitkin County, Colorado, United States. The city population was 7,004 at the 2020 United States census. Aspen is in a remote area of the Rocky Mountains&#x27; Sawatch Range and Elk Mountains, along the Roaring Fork River at an elevation just below on the Western Slope, west of the Continental Divide. Aspen is now a part of the Glenwood Springs, CO Micropolitan Statistical Area.

Founded as a mining camp during the Colorado Silver Boom and later named Aspen for the abundance of aspen trees in the area, the city boomed during the 1880s, its first decade. The boom ended when the Panic of 1893 led to a collapse of the silver market. For the next half-century, known as &quot;the quiet years&quot;, the population steadily declined, reaching a nadir of fewer than 1000 by 1930. Aspen&#x27;s fortunes recovered in the mid-20th century when neighboring Aspen Mountain was developed into a ski resort, and industrialist Walter Paepcke bought many properties in the city in the 1950s and redeveloped them. Today it is home to three institutions, two of which Paepcke helped found, having international importance: the Aspen Music Festival and School, the Aspen Institute, and the Aspen Center for Physics.

In the late 20th century, the town became a popular retreat for celebrities. Gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson worked out of a downtown hotel and ran unsuccessfully for county sheriff. Singer John Denver wrote two songs about Aspen after settling there. Both figures popularized Aspen among the counter-cultural youth of the 1970s as an ideal place to live, and the city continued to grow even as it gained notoriety for some of the era&#x27;s hedonistic excesses (particularly its drug culture).

Aspen remains popular as a year-round destination for locals, second-home buyers and tourists. Outdoor recreation in the surrounding White River National Forest serves as a summertime counterpart to the city&#x27;s four ski areas. Prime residential real estate in Aspen is the most expensive of any ski resort in the world on a per-square-foot basis, according to a study of 44 global ski resorts. Aspen is the world&#x27;s second-highest-rated ski resort in terms of &quot;the quality and reliability of their conditions and their capacity to withstand climate change.&quot;

==History==

The city&#x27;s roots are traced to the winter of 1879, when a group of miners ignored pleas by Frederick Pitkin, Governor of Colorado, to return across the Continental Divide to avoid a Ute uprising. The Utes were fighting to maintain possession of their land and communities. Originally named Ute City, the small community was renamed Aspen. The Aspen, Colorado, post office opened on June 7, 1880. Pitkin County was created on February 23, 1881, with Aspen as its first and only seat. The Town of Aspen was incorporated on April 1, 1881. In its peak production years of 1891 and 1892, Aspen surpassed Leadville as the United States&#x27; most productive silver-mining district. Production expanded due to the passage of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890, which doubled the government&#x27;s purchase of silver. In 1883, the Apostolic Vicarate of Colorado&#x27;s Bishop Machebeuf had the Reverend Edward Downey establish the first Catholic mission in Aspen.

By 1893, Aspen had banks, a hospital, a police department, two theaters, an opera house, and electric lights. Economic collapse came with the Panic of 1893, when President Cleveland called a special session of Congress and repealed the act. Within weeks, many of the Aspen mines were closed and thousands of miners were put out of work. It was proposed that silver be recognized as legal tender and the People&#x27;s Party (populists) adopted that as one of its main issues. Davis H. Waite, an Aspen newspaperman and agitator, was elected governor of Colorado on the Democratic ticket, but in time the movement failed.

Eventually, after wage cuts, mining revived somewhat, but production declined and by the 1930 census only 705 residents remained. Remaining, however, were stocks of old commercial buildings and residences, along with excellent snow. Aspen&#x27;s development as a ski resort began in the 1930s when investors conceived of a ski area, but the project was interrupted by World War II. Friedl Pfeifer, a member of the 10th Mountain Division who had trained in the area, returned to the area and linked up with industrialist Walter Paepcke and his wife Elizabeth. The Aspen Skiing Company was founded in 1946 and the city quickly became a well-known resort, hosting the FIS World Championships in 1950. Paepcke also played an important role in bringing the Goethe Bicentennial Convocation to Aspen in 1949, an event held in a newly designed tent by the architect Eero Saarinen. Aspen was then on the path to becoming an internationally known ski resort and cultural center, home of the Aspen Music Festival and School. The area would continue to grow with the development of three additional ski areas, Buttermilk (1958), Aspen Highlands (1958), and Snowmass (1967).

In the 1970s, Aspen became known as a playground for the rich and famous. Notable celebrities frequented the town and ski slopes, also John Denver was one of the more famous permanent residents. In 1978, Aspen was thoroughly photographed for the Aspen Movie Map project funded by the U.S. Department of Defense. The Movie Map is one of the earliest examples of virtual reality software.

In 1999, the city council passed a resolution to petition the US Congress and President Clinton to restrict US immigration. Aspen residents cited concerns about the environmental impacts of increased immigration on their community, including urban and suburban sprawl, pollution from the older automobiles typically driven by immigrants, and litter accumulating in the mountains attributable to the increasing population. The impetus for the resolution was the increasing number of trailer parks that housed the migrant workers employed locally in the service sector and ski industry. The parks were perceived to be degrading to the town&#x27;s image, property values, and environment. The move was led by Terry Paulson, an Aspen City Council member, and supported and guided by national groups such as the Carrying Capacity Network, and the Center for Immigration Studies. The resolution was discussed on the &quot;American Patrol Report&quot; website, contributing to a controversy over whether or not the resolution was racially motivated. Councilman Terry Paulson and some Aspen citizens insisted that it was motivated entirely by environmental concerns.

Aspen is notable as the smallest radio market tracked by Arbitron, ranked number 302.

Local media in Aspen include a public radio station, KJAX, a public television station, the Grassroots TV network; three commercial radio stations, KSNO, KTND, and KSPN; two daily newspapers, &quot;The Aspen Times&quot; and &quot;The Aspen Daily News&quot;; three local lifestyle magazines, &quot;Aspen Sojourner&quot;, &quot;Aspen Magazine&quot; and the biannual &quot;Aspen Peak&quot;; and a local, live, commercial lifestyle television channel, Aspen 82.

The city&#x27;s character has transformed dramatically in recent decades by skyrocketing property values and the proliferation of second homes, increasingly shutting low- and middle-income workers out of the city and creating a large pool of commuters from nearby bedroom communities such as Snowmass, Basalt, Carbondale, and Glenwood Springs. At the same time, in stark contrast to its historic character, the city has emerged into international fame as a glitzy playground of the wealthy and famous. Aspen has become a second and third home to many international jet-setters. Many people from the U.S. and abroad vacation in Aspen, especially during the winter.

The downtown has been largely transformed into an upscale shopping district that includes high-end restaurants, salons, and boutiques. Stores such as Gucci, Prada and Fendi dot South Mill Street and act as a &quot;Rodeo Drive&quot; of Aspen.

==Geography==
The city sits along the southeast (upper) end of the Roaring Fork Valley, along the Roaring Fork River, a tributary of the Colorado River about south of Glenwood Springs, Colorado. It is surrounded by mountain and wilderness areas on three sides: Red Mountain to the north, Smuggler Mountain to the east, and Aspen Mountain to the south.

Aspen is located along State Highway 82.

At the 2020 United States census, the city had a total area of , all of it land.

===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Aspen has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;) owing to its high elevation. There is a large diurnal temperature variation between daytime and nighttime temperatures, rendering summer days moderately warm and winter nights very cold for the latitude. Summer lows and winter highs are relatively moderate, and frosts are rare in summer and winter days often averaging above freezing.
==Demographics==

As of the census of 2003, there were 5,914 people, 2,903 households, and 1,082 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 4,354 housing units at an average density of 1,233.5 per square mile (476.2 per km2). The racial makeup of the city was 94.94 percent White, 0.44 percent Black or African American, 0.24 percent Native American, 1.45 percent Asian, 0.08 percent Pacific Islander, 1.64 percent from other races, and 1.2 percent from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 6.14 percent of the population.

There were 2,903 households, of which 16.5 percent had children under the age of 18 living with them, 28.8 percent were married couples living together, 5.6 percent had a female householder with no husband present, and 62.7 percent were non-families. Single individuals composed 43.8 percent of all households, and 4.8 percent had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.94 and the average family size was 2.67.

The ages of the population were 13.1 percent under the age of 18, 9.8 percent from 18 to 24, 42.1 percent from 25 to 44, 27.6 percent from 45 to 64, and 7.4 percent who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 115.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 117.5 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $53,750, and the median income for a family was $70,300. Males had a median income of $41,011 versus $32,023 for females. The per capita income for the city was $40,680. About 3.6 percent of families and 8.2 percent of the population were below the poverty line, including 4.4 percent of those under age 18 and 2.6 percent of those age 65 or over.
===Housing===
Aspen&#x27;s single-family home prices are among the highest of any town in the country. Real estate supply is restricted due to a moratorium on new housing construction, housing renovation and short-term rentals. The median sales price of a single family home in 2021 in Aspen was $9.5 million. A 2023 study by Savills, a global real estate broker, declared that prime Aspen real estate was the most expensive on a per-square-foot-basis of the 44 global ski resort markets it studied.

Relatively less expensive housing can be found outside the city limits, in nearby Snowmass Village (median single family home price $5.2 million in 2021), or in the city&#x27;s condos, many of which date to the 1960s and 1970s.

Affordability of housing is a severe challenge for workers in the Aspen area. The Aspen Pitkin County Housing Authority oversees an extensive program of properties intended for people who primarily live and work in the Roaring Fork Valley and whose income falls below certain limits, known as Employee Housing. Homes purchased through Employee Housing programs typically contain deed restrictions to maintain a degree of affordability for local residents, but even deed-restricted properties in the area can cost close to $1 million.

==Sports==

The Winter X Games sports event has been held in Aspen at Buttermilk (ski area) since 2002. Aspen natives Torin Yater-Wallace and Alex Ferreira are both freestyle skiers who compete in the Winter X Games and have very successful careers. Both Torin and Alex have represented the United States of America in Men&#x27;s Ski SuperPipe at the Olympic Games.

The Gentlemen of Aspen is the local rugby team. The Gentlemen of Aspen won the Rugby Super League several times: 1997, 2001, 2002.

==Government==
Aspen is a home rule municipality under Colorado law. It has a council-manager government. An elected council of four members and the mayor supervise the city&#x27;s operations, managed on a day-to-day basis by the city manager, an appointed official who serves at their pleasure.

The city&#x27;s main office is at City Hall, the former Armory Hall listed on the National Register of Historic Places at the intersection of South Galena Street and East Hopkins Avenue. Because of its expansion in the late-20th century, it has outgrown that space. Several city departments are housed in satellite offices around the city.

==Education==
, based on data from the 2009–10 school year, according to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, Aspen High School, the only high school in the Aspen School District, is the top ranked high school in Colorado and ranked 59th in the United States. The high school has grades 9 to 12, 540 students, and 41 teachers. Olympic cross-country skier Noah Hoffman is a 2007 graduate.

Minorities, mostly Hispanic, make up 13 percent of the school&#x27;s enrollment. Four percent of the students are economically disadvantaged. The school has a high rate of participation in the International Baccalaureate program.

==Transportation==
* Roaring Fork Transportation Authority, or RFTA, provides free bus service within Aspen and Snowmass Village, and pay service to the surrounding communities of Basalt, El Jebel, Carbondale, Glenwood Springs, and Rifle. Amtrak serves Glenwood Springs, offering in conjunction with RFTA an environmentally friendly way to travel to Aspen.
* Aspen&#x27;s airport is Aspen-Pitkin County Airport, also known as Sardy Field. The airport is an FAA Class 1 airport and has one asphalt runway, wide and long. The airport is commercially serviced by American Airlines, Delta Airlines, and United Airlines.
* State Highway 82 is the only major road that provides access to Aspen. There are some mountain pass roads that lead to the city, but those require all-terrain vehicles and are typically impassable during the winter. Highway 82 east of Aspen is also impassable due to snow on Independence Pass, leaving Highway 82 west of Aspen as the only means of motor vehicle access during the winter. Highway 82 east of Aspen is typically closed from approximately the end of October to Memorial Day, depending on snow conditions.
* The bike-sharing system WE-CYCLE serves Aspen and Basalt with 16 stations and 200 bikes. Docking stations and bikes are built by PBSC Urban Solutions.

<text>Leadville ( ) is a statutory city that is the county seat, the most populous community, and the only incorporated municipality in Lake County, Colorado, United States. The city population was 2,633 at the 2020 United States census. It is situated at an elevation of . Leadville is the highest incorporated city in the United States and is surrounded by two of the tallest peaks in the state.

Leadville is a former silver mining town that lies among the headwaters of the Arkansas River within the Rocky Mountains. The Leadville Historic District, designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961, contains many historic structures and sites of Leadville&#x27;s mining era. In the late 19th century, Leadville was the second most populous city in Colorado, after Denver.

==History==

===Settlement===
The Leadville area was first settled in 1859 when placer gold was discovered by A. G. Kelley in California Gulch, and by Abe Lee in April (25/26) 1860, during the Pikes Peak Gold Rush. Prospectors panned for gold in the stream that ran through California Gulch in what became the town of Oro City (&quot;oro&quot; is the Spanish word for gold). Horace Tabor, who became known as the &quot;Leadville Silver King&quot;, and his wife Augusta were among the first prospectors to arrive in Oro City. Horace was appointed as the postmaster of Oro City on November 30, 1868. His wife made money as postmistress, banker, cook, and laundress while Tabor was a prospector.

The early miners had noted that mining for placer gold was hampered by heavy black sand in the sluice boxes, and in 1874 it was discovered that the heavy sand that impeded gold recovery was the lead mineral cerussite, which has a high silver content. Prospectors traced the cerussite to its source, present day Leadville, and by 1876 had discovered several silver-lead lode deposits. As the gold has been tapped out of the gulch and attention was averted to nearby Leadville, a mile or two away, Oro City became a ghost town.

===Founding of Leadville===

Leadville was founded in 1877 by mine owners Horace Tabor and August Meyer at the start of the Colorado Silver Boom. Tabor&#x27;s house was also built in 1877, at 116 E. 5th Street. The town was built on desolate flat land below the tree line. The first miners lived in a rough tented camp near the silver deposits in California Gulch. Initially, the settlement was called &quot;Slabtown&quot;, but when the residents petitioned for a post office, the name &quot;Leadville&quot; was chosen. By 1880, Tabor and Meyer&#x27;s new town had gas lighting, water mains, of streets, five churches, three hospitals, six banks, and a school for 1,100 students. Many business buildings were constructed with bricks hauled in by wagons. 

In early 1878, Meyer, along with Leadville&#x27;s pioneer smelter entrepreneur, Edwin Harrison, after whom the famed Harrison Avenue is named, and Tabor established a post office in Leadville, with George L. Henderson designated as postmaster on July 16, 1877. The post office and the telegraph office both prospered, with Tabor serving as postmaster from February 19 to December 13, 1878. It was said that the Leadville post office was the busiest one between St. Louis and San Francisco. In 1878, the town&#x27;s first hospital, St. Vincent&#x27;s, was opened.

The town&#x27;s first newspaper was &quot;The Reveille&quot;, a Republican weekly, in 1878. Three months later, a competing Democratic weekly, &quot;The Eclipse&quot;, emerged. &quot;The Chronicle&quot; was the town&#x27;s first daily and first newspaper in America to employ a full-time female reporter. Like the &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot;, &quot;The Chronicle&quot; took the lead in outing criminals and thieves, in an attempt to clean up the town&#x27;s shady business culture. Despite violent threats, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; survived without major incident.

William Nye opened the first saloon in 1877, and it was followed by many others. The same year the Coliseum Novelty was the first theater to open. It offered sleeping rooms upstairs for a nightly rate and provided a variety of entertainments: dancing girls, dogfights, cockfighting, wrestling and boxing matches, and rooms for gambling. In June 1881, it burned to the ground. Ben Wood, who arrived in Leadville in 1878, opened the first legitimate theater, Wood&#x27;s Opera House, with a thousand seats. It was a first-class theater, where gentleman removed their hats and did not smoke or drink in the presence of a lady. Less than a year later, Wood opened the Windsor Hotel. His opera house was regarded as the largest and best theater constructed in the West, an honor it held until the opening of the Tabor Opera House. Horace Tabor&#x27;s Opera House was the most costly structure in Colorado at the time. Building materials were brought by wagons from Denver. The massive three-story opera house, constructed of stone, brick, and iron, opened on November 20, 1879. Tabor, originally from Vermont, became the town&#x27;s first mayor. After striking it rich, he had an estimated net worth of 10 million dollars and was known for his extravagant lifestyle. In February 1879 the Lake County seat was moved to Leadville, where it has remained ever since. In 1879, An impressive courthouse was built on the west side of Harrison Avenue, joined by a new post office that same year. Telephone service was introduced by Western Union on May 15, 1879, and gas lighting downtown was installed on November 18 that same year. Billings and Eilers Smelter installed a generator and lights for the town on May 13, 1881. On May 19, 1882, a large fire broke out at the corner of Harrison Avenue and East Chestnut.
Horace Tabor divorced his wife of 25 years and married Baby Doe McCourt on September 30, 1882, who was half his age. Tabor was by then a US senator, and the divorce and marriage caused a scandal in Colorado and beyond. For several years, the couple lived a lavish lifestyle in a Denver mansion, but Tabor, one of the wealthiest men in Colorado, lost his fortune when the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act caused the Panic of 1893. He died on April 10, 1899, of appendicitis, destitute but remained convinced that the price of silver would rebound. According to legend, he told Baby Doe to &quot;hold on the Matchless mine... it will make millions again when silver comes back.&quot; She returned to Leadville with her daughters, Silver Dollar and Lily, where she spent the rest of her life believing Tabor&#x27;s prediction. At one time the &quot;best dressed woman in the West&quot;, she lived in a cabin at the Matchless Mine for the last three decades of her life. On March 7, 1935, after a snowstorm, she was found frozen in her cabin, aged about 81 years.

===Mining and smelting===

Mining in the Leadville area began in 1859 when prospectors discovered gold at the mouth of California Gulch. By 1872, placer mining in California Gulch yielded more than $2,500,000, roughly . In 1876, black sand, once considered bothersome to placer gold miners, was discovered to contain lead carbonates, leading to a rush of miners to the area and the founding of the town in 1877. By 1880, Leadville was one of the world&#x27;s largest and richest silver camps, with a population of more than 15,000. Income from more than thirty mines and ten large smelting works produced gold, silver, and lead amounting to $15,000,000 annually. The Leadville strike of 1880 was the first major labor conflict in the central Colorado silver boomtown, shutting down most of the area’s mining district from May 26, 1880.

According to one historian of the era, &quot;The outpouring of the precious metal from Leadville transformed the struggling Centennial State into a veritable autocrat in the colony of states. As if by magic the rough frontier town of Denver became a metropolis; stately buildings arose on the site of shanties; crystal streams flowed through the arid plains and the desert blossomed and became fruitful. Poverty gave way to the annoyance of wealth and the fame of silver state spread throughout the world.&quot;

Swindles were not uncommon in the mining community. When the Little Pittsburg mine was exhausted of its rich ore body, its managers sold their shares while concealing the mine&#x27;s actual condition from the other stockholders. &quot;Chicken Bill&quot; Lovell dumped a wheelbarrow load of silver-rich ore into a barren pit on his Chrysolite claim in order to sell it to Horace Tabor for a large price. Tabor had the last laugh when his miners dug a few feet farther and discovered a rich ore body. Some time later the manager of the Chrysolite mine fooled an outside mining engineer into overestimating the mine&#x27;s ore reserves.

The city&#x27;s fortunes declined with the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in 1893, although afterwards there was another small gold boom. Mining companies came to rely increasingly on income from the lead and zinc. The district is credited with producing over 2.9 million troy ounces of gold, 240 million troy ounces of silver, 1 million short tons of lead, 785 thousand short tons of zinc (discovered in 1911), and 53 thousand short tons of copper.

A bitter strike by Leadville&#x27;s hard rock miners in 1896–97 led to bloodshed, at least five deaths, and the burning of the Coronado Mine. In a letter to a London business contact, mine owner Eben Smith wrote, &quot;The strikers got the worst of it in the raid on the Coronado and Emmet [mines], there were 10 or 12 killed; we do not know how many, and a great number wounded; they take care of their wounded the same as the Indians but every now and then a fellow turns up that the rats have been eating or who has gone to decay that we know must have been shot ...&quot;

World War II caused an increase in the demand for molybdenum, used to harden steel. It was mined at the nearby Climax mine, which at one time produced 75 percent of the world&#x27;s output. By 1980, the Climax Mine was the largest underground mine in the world. Taxes paid by the mine provided Leadville with good schools and libraries and provided employment for many residents. When the market dropped in 1981, Leadville&#x27;s economy suffered and many people lost their jobs. With little industry other than the tourist trade, most of the former miners left, and the standard of living declined. Climax reopened in 2008 and started production in 2010. It currently is the most efficient mine producing molybdenum in Colorado and is estimated to have a production life of thirty years.

The many years of mining left behind substantial contamination of the soil and water and the Environmental Protection Agency designated some former mines Superfund sites, such as California Gulch. As of 2019, the EPA reports: &quot;A vast majority of the cleanup at the site has been completed, so current risk of exposure is low. Pregnant women, nursing mothers and young children are still encouraged to have their blood-lead levels checked.&quot;

===Notable historical figures===
As the population boomed, by 1878, Leadville had the reputation as one of the most lawless towns in the West. The first city marshal was run out of town a few days after he was appointed, and his replacement was shot dead within a month by one of his deputies. Fearing the town would be lost to the lawless element, Mayor Horace Tabor sent for Mart Duggan, who was living in Denver, as a replacement. Duggan was well known at the time as a fearless gunfighter. Using strong-arm and lawless tactics, during his two stints as marshal, Duggan brought order to Leadville by 1880 when he stepped down. He was shot and killed in 1888 by an unknown assailant, most likely an enemy he had made when he was a Leadville marshal. Historian Robert Dearment writes, &quot;Mart Duggan was a quick-shooting, hard-drinking, brawling tough Irish man, but he was exactly the kind of man a tough, hard-drinking, quick-shooting camp like Leadville needed in its earliest days. His name is all but forgotten today, but the name &quot;Matt Dillon&quot; is recognized around the world. Such are the vagaries of life.&quot;

Alice Ivers, better known as Poker Alice, was a card player and dealer of the Old West who learned her trade in Leadville. Born in Devonshire, her family moved to America when she was a small girl. They first settled in Virginia, where she attended an elite girls&#x27; boarding school. When she was a teenager, her family moved to Leadville when the silver boom drew hundreds of new residents to the area. At the age of twenty she married a mining engineer who, like many of the men at that time, frequented the numerous gambling halls in Leadville. Alice went along, at first just observing, but eventually she began to sit in on the games as well. After a few years of marriage her husband was killed in a mining accident and she turned to cards to support herself. Alice was attractive, dressed in the latest fashions, and was in great demand as a dealer. Eventually Alice left Leadville to travel the gambling circuit, as was common of the male gamblers of that time. She continued to dress in the latest fashions but took to smoking cigars. Well known throughout the West, gambling halls welcomed her because she was good for business. Alice said that she won more than $250,000 by gambling during her lifetime.

In the spring of 1880, Texas Jack Omohundro and his wife Giuseppina Morlacchi arrived in Leadville. Morlacchi, a famous Italian prima ballerina who had introduced the Can-can dance to the United States, performed several plays at the Grand Central Theatre, including Around the World in 80 Days and The Black Crook. Texas Jack, who had starred in The Scouts of the Prairie with Buffalo Bill Cody and Ned Buntline, and later in The Scouts of the Plains with Buffalo Bill and Wild Bill Hickok, played shows at the Chestnut Street Theatre. Texas Jack had served in the Confederate Army at age 16 and subsequently joined the Tabor Light Guard, a local militia unit. Jack died of pneumonia on June 28, 1880. His funeral was held at the Tabor Opera House, and he was buried in Evergreen Cemetery. On September 8, 1908, Texas Jack&#x27;s best friend and former costar Buffalo Bill Cody visited Leadville with his Wild West Show and dedicated the permanent memorial that marks Texas Jack&#x27;s grave today. The Texas Jack Association erected highway historical markers on roads in and out of Leadville.

In the summer of 1879, American author and illustrator Mary Hallock Foote arrived in Leadville. It is believed her time in Leadville inspired her writing.

In 1882, shortly after the gun fight at the O.K. Corral, Doc Holliday arrived in Leadville, where he dealt faro. On August 19, 1884, he shot ex-Leadville policeman Billy Allen, who had threatened him for failing to pay a $5 debt. Despite overwhelming evidence implicating him, a jury found Holliday not guilty of the shooting or attempted murder.

Gunfighter and professional gambler Luke Short also spent time in Leadville.

Margaret &quot;Molly&quot; Brown, who became known as &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot;, moved to Leadville in 1885, when she was 18 years old. In 1886 she married a mining engineer who was twelve years older, James Joseph Brown at the Church of Annunciation. The Brown family acquired great wealth in 1893 when Brown was instrumental in the discovery of a substantial gold ore seam at the Little Jonny Mine.

The mine was owned by his employers, the Ibex Mining Company. Margaret Brown became famous because of her survival of the 1912 sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;, after exhorting the crew of to return to look for survivors. A 1960 Broadway musical based on her life was produced, along with a 1964 film adaptation of the musical, both titled &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot;. Her home in Denver has been preserved as the Molly Brown House Museum.

Meyer Guggenheim of the Guggenheim family started out in Leadville in mining and smelting. The family went on to possess one of the largest fortunes in the world. Family members have become known for their philanthropy in diverse areas such as modern art and aviation, including several Guggenheim Museums.

Oscar Wilde appeared in April at the Tabor Opera House during his 1882 American Aesthetic Movement lecture tour. The reviews were mixed, and the press satirized Wilde in cartoons as an English dandy decorated with sunflowers and lilies, the floral emblems of the Aesthetic Movement. A Kansas newspaper described the event:

Oscar Wilde&#x27;s visit to Leadville excited a great deal of interest and curiosity. The Tabor-opera house where he lectured was packed full. It was rumored that an attempt would be made by a number of young men to ridicule him by coming to the lecture in exaggerated costume with enormous sunflowers and lilies and to introduce a number of characters in the costume of the Western &quot;bad men&quot;. Probably, however, better counsel prevailed and no disturbance took place.

Mayor David H. Dougan invited Wilde to tour the Matchless Mine and name its new lode &quot;The Oscar&quot;. Wilde later recounted a visit to a local saloon, &quot;where I saw the only rational method of art criticism I have ever come across. Over the piano was printed a notice – &#x27;Please do not shoot the pianist. He is doing his best.&#x27;&quot;

Several other notable figures visited the Tabor Opera House, including boxer Jack Dempsey.

===Post-mining era===
The town has made major efforts to improve its economy by encouraging tourism and emphasizing its history and opportunities for outdoor recreation. The National Mining Museum and Hall of Fame opened in 1987 with a federal charter that was drawn in by Leadville offering a good deal on the former high school building.

In 1983, Ken Chlouber partnered with Merilee Maupin to founded the Leadville Trail 100 Run, a 100-mile ultramarathon through the rugged mountain terrain around the town. It succeeded, leading them to found the still-extant Leadville Race Series, which contains a variety of races. The Leadville Race Series has become a popular endurance race series, attracting hundreds of athletes to Leadville each year. Leadville is often used as a base for altitude training and hosts a number of other events for runners and mountain bicyclists.

==Geography==
At an elevation of , Leadville lies close to timberline, which in Colorado is from . The surrounding peaks are all well above 12,000 feet, and are thus bare of trees. Leadville has the highest elevation of any city in the United States.

Leadville lies in a valley at the headwaters of the Arkansas River which flows through the southern Rocky Mountains and eventually empties into the Mississippi River. It is situated between two mountain ranges, the Mosquito Range to the east and the Sawatch Range to the west, both of which include several nearby peaks with elevations above , the so-called fourteeners. Mount Elbert, southwest of Leadville, is the highest summit of the Rocky Mountains of North America and the highest point in the Colorado and the entire Mississippi River drainage basin. An ultra-prominent fourteener, Mount Elbert is the highest summit of the Sawatch Range and the second-highest summit in the contiguous United States after Mount Whitney in California. Mount Massive, west-southwest of Leadville, at is the second highest summit in the Rocky Mountains and state of Colorado, and the third highest in the contiguous United States.

===Historic sites and districts===
The Leadville Historic District was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1961. The district encompasses 67 mines east of the city up to the elevation, and a defined portion of the village area, with specific exclusions for various buildings. The principal historic buildings are the Tabor Grand Hotel, St George&#x27;s Church, Temple Israel, African Methodist Episcopal Church (est. 1881)African Methodist Episcopal Church (est. 1881), the Annunciation Church, Tabor Opera House, City Hall, Healy House, Dexter Cabin, Engelbach House, Tabor House, and the Golden Burro Cafe and Lounge, as well as mining structures and small homes.

The National Mining Hall of Fame on West 9th Street is dedicated to commemorating the work of miners and people that work with natural resources. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Major exhibits include an elaborate model railroad, a walk-through replica of an underground hardrock mine, the Gold Rush Room with specimens of native gold, a large collection of mineral specimens, and a mining art gallery. The site also includes the Matchless Mine and cabin, former home of Baby Doe Tabor.

Some historic sites are linked by the Mineral Belt National Recreation Trail, an all-season biking/walking trail that loops around Leadville and through its historic mining district. In part it follows old mining-camp railbeds. Interpretative kiosks recount the history and a photograph of what was on that particular site more than a century ago. The trail is well-marked with interpretive signs and altitude and mileage markers.

Created by Executive Order in 1889 to increase the supply of fish for inland waters, the Leadville National Fish Hatchery was established.

Camp Hale is located north of Leadville in the Eagle River valley north of Tennessee Pass. It was a U.S. Army ski warfare training facility constructed in 1942 for what became the 10th Mountain Division. Some of the nation&#x27;s finest skiers were employed as instructors. Soldiers were trained in mountain climbing, Alpine and Nordic skiing, and cold-weather survival, as well as various weapons and ordnance. When it was in full operation, approximately 15,000 soldiers were housed there. As the only source of recreation for the trainees, Leadville was persuaded to change its moral character, perceived &quot;to be on a rather low plane&quot; at the time. In 2019, Camp Hale was designated as a National Historic Site offering a self-guiding tour with interpretive signs at ten stops and a larger interpretive site at the main entrance. President Biden used his authority under the Antiquities Act in 2022 to establish the 53,804-acre Camp Hale-Continental Divide National Monument, preserving the area’s important historic, prehistoric, natural, and recreational values.

 north of Leadville the old downhill training slope, Cooper Hill, located atop Tennessee Pass on the Continental Divide, now operates as the Ski Cooper resort. Much of the area is above the tree line, providing a panoramic view of the peaks of the Sawatch Range to visitors. A memorial to troops of the 10th Mountain Division is located at the summit.

The Evergreen Cemetery was the first cemetery in Leadville, established on November 1, 1879.

The town&#x27;s first library was built in 1904.

A federal building was built in 1905 on Harrison Avenue and 8th Street. It served as the town post office until 1973.

===Events===
Boom Days, held on the first full weekend of August, is a tribute to the city&#x27;s mining past. The event has been honored by Congress as a Local Legacy Event. The festivities held over three days include mining competitions and burro racing, motorcycle games, a rod and gun show, live music, a craft fair and parade. The annual skijoring event and Crystal Carnival take place in March. This is a horse-drawn skiing for the family since the 1960s. The town has frequent, sometimes small parades held in the downtown area, such as the quirky St Patrick&#x27;s Day Practice Parade.

The Leadville Trail 100, an ultramarathon, takes place each August since 1983 on an out-and-back course on trails around Turquoise Lake, over Hagerman Pass, the Colorado Trail, through Twin Lakes, across the Arkansas River, up and over Hope Pass, to the ghost town of Winfield.

The &quot;Route of the Silver Kings&quot; is a driving tour of the historic mining district. The tour passes mines, power plants, ghost towns and mining camps.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===


Leadville is served by Lake County Airport, North America&#x27;s highest public use airport at an altitude of 9,934 feet. However, there is no scheduled airline service available from this airport. The closest airports to provide scheduled services are Eagle County Regional Airport and Aspen/Pitkin County Airport, both away.

====Highways====
* US 24 is an east–west highway running from Interstate 75 near Clarkston, Michigan, to Interstate 70 near Minturn, Colorado. Its western terminus is located just north of Leadville. It is the main route to the Eagle-Vail valley to the northwest and Colorado Springs, to the southeast.
* State Highway 91 is a highway that connects Leadville with Interstate 70 near Copper Mountain. It is the quickest route to get from Leadville to Denver, away.
*The Top of the Rockies Byway, designated a National Scenic Byway in 1998, is a highway that travels starting in Aspen and traveling through Leadville to either Minturn or Copper Mountain.

====Railways====

* On July 22, 1880, the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railway arrived on a narrow-gauge railway branch from Malta, to the west. General Grant and his wife were on hand to celebrate the arrival. Third rail was added in 1888, and from 1940 it was only standard gauge. The last were abandoned by Union Pacific in 1998. This severed the connection between the Leadville, Colorado &amp; Southern Railroad and the rest of the railroad system. The remaining three miles from Malta have not seen any traffic in many years.
** In the past, D&amp;RG operated branch lines from Leadville to Oro City (1883–1941), Ibex/Chrysolite (1898–1944), Graham Park (1898–1941) and Fryer Hill (1881–1944). Another branch run over Fremont Pass as far as Robinson, Wheeler, and Dillon (1881/2-1923).

<text>The Pike&#x27;s Peak gold rush (later known as the Colorado gold rush) was the boom in gold prospecting and mining in the Pike&#x27;s Peak Country of western Kansas Territory and southwestern Nebraska Territory of the United States that began in July 1858 and lasted until roughly the creation of the Colorado Territory on February 28, 1861. An estimated 100,000 gold seekers took part in one of the greatest gold rushes in North American history.

The participants in the gold rush were known as &quot;Fifty-Niners&quot; after 1859, the peak year of the rush and often used the motto Pike&#x27;s Peak or Bust! In fact, the location of the Pike&#x27;s Peak gold rush was centered north of Pikes Peak. The name Pike&#x27;s Peak gold rush was used mainly because of how well known and important Pike&#x27;s Peak was at the time. The rush created a few towns such as Denver and Boulder that would develop into cities.

==Overview==

The Pike&#x27;s Peak gold rush, which followed the California gold rush by approximately a decade, produced a dramatic but temporary influx of migrants and immigrants into the Pike&#x27;s Peak Country of the Southern Rocky Mountains. The rush was exemplified by the slogan &quot;Pike&#x27;s Peak or Bust!&quot;, a reference to the prominent mountain at the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains that guided many early prospectors to the region westward over the Great Plains. The prospectors provided the first major European-American population in the region.

The rush created a few gold rush towns such as Denver City and Boulder City that would develop into cities. Many smaller camps such as Auraria and Saint Charles City were absorbed by larger camps and towns. Scores of other mining camps have faded into ghost towns, but quite a few camps such as Central City, Black Hawk, Georgetown, and Idaho Springs survived.

==Discovery==
For many years, people had suspected the mountains in present-day Colorado contained numerous rich gold deposits. In 1835, French trapper Eustace Carriere lost his party and ended up wandering through the mountains for many weeks. During those weeks he found many gold specimens which he later took back to New Mexico for examination. Upon examination, they turned out to be &quot;pure gold&quot;. But when he tried to lead an expedition back to the location of where he found the gold, they came up short because he could not quite remember the location.

On January 24, 1848, James W. Marshall found placer gold near Coloma, California, and unbeknownst nine days later, Mexico ceded California and the rest of northern Mexico to the United States with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The California Gold Rush ensued. In the spring of 1850, John Beck led a party of predominately Cherokee veterans of the Georgia Gold Rush to the California gold fields. The party followed the Trail of Tears west, and on June 22, 1850, they crossed the South Platte River (a few miles north of what is today Denver) and camped near the confluence of two streams. One of the prospectors, Lewis Ralston panned for gold near the mouth of the smaller stream (in what is now Gold Strike Park in Arvada, Colorado.) He found about ¼ troy ounce (8 g) of gold, then worth about five dollars (about $550 USD today.) While Ralston was elated, the rest of the party was unimpressed and continued on to California the next morning. Ralston continued panning for gold, but gave up after a few days and caught up with his party.
As the hysteria of the California Gold Rush faded, many discouraged gold seekers returned home. Rumors of gold in the Rocky Mountains persisted and several small parties explored the region. In the summer of 1857, a party of Spanish-speaking gold seekers from Taos, New Mexico, worked a placer deposit along the South Platte River about above Cherry Creek at a location later known as Mexican Diggings near the Overland Park Golf Course in Denver.
William Greeneberry &quot;Green&quot; Russell was a Georgian who worked in the California gold fields in the 1850s. Russell was married to a Cherokee woman, and through his connections to the tribe, he heard about Ralston&#x27;s 1850 discovery of gold along the South Platte River. Green Russell organized a party to prospect along the South Platte River, setting off with his two brothers and six companions in February 1858. They rendezvoused with Cherokee tribe members along the Arkansas River in present-day Oklahoma and continued westward along the Santa Fe Trail. Others joined the party along the way until their number reached 107.

Upon reaching Bent&#x27;s Fort, they turned to the northwest, reaching the confluence of Cherry Creek and the South Platte on May 23. The site of their initial explorations is in present-day Confluence Park in Denver. They began prospecting in the river beds, exploring Cherry Creek and nearby Ralston Creek but without success. In the first week of July 1858, Green Russell and Sam Bates found a small placer deposit near the mouth of Little Dry Creek that yielded about 20 troy ounces (620 g) of gold, then worth about 380 dollars (about $44,000 USD today.) This was the first significant gold discovery in the Rocky Mountain region. The site of the discovery is in the present-day Denver suburb of Englewood, just north of the junction of U.S. Highway 285 and U.S. Highway 85. This discovery was announced with great excitement by the &quot;Kansas City Journal of Commerce&quot; on 26 August 1858 with the headline, &quot;THE NEW ELDORADO!! GOLD IN KANSAS!!&quot;

==Initial boom==
The first decade of the boom was largely concentrated along the South Platte River at the base of the Rocky Mountains, in the canyon of Clear Creek in the mountains west of Golden City, at Breckenridge and in South Park at Como, Fairplay, and Alma. By 1860, Denver City, Golden City, and Boulder City were substantial towns that served the mines. Rapid population growth led to the creation of the Colorado Territory in 1861.

The Pike&#x27;s Peak gold rush sent many Americans into a frenzy, prompting them to pack up their belongings and head to Colorado. This initial boom influenced people to begin falsifying information, often sending people out to the west without any proof of a true presence of gold. As early as the spring of 1859, people raced to the Pike&#x27;s Peak country. Some even dared to go out in the winter of 1858 to try to get a head start, only to realize that they would have to wait until the snow melted to begin mining.

===Free gold===

Hardrock mining boomed for a few years, but then declined in the mid-1860s as the miners exhausted the shallow parts of the veins that contained free gold, and found that their amalgamation mills could not recover gold from the deeper sulfide ores. Colorado produced 150,000 ounces of gold in 1861 and 225,000 troy ounces in 1862. This led Congress to establish the Denver Mint. Cumulative Colorado production by 1865 was 1.25 million ounces, of which sixty percent was placer gold.

<doc id="48925" wikidata="Q310092" url="?curid=48925" title="Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester">
<text>Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester ( – 4 August 1265), later sometimes referred to as Simon V de Montfort to distinguish him from his namesake relatives, was an English nobleman of French origin and a member of the English peerage, who led the baronial opposition to the rule of King Henry III of England, culminating in the Second Barons&#x27; War. Following his initial victories over royal forces, he became &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the country, and played a major role in the constitutional development of England.

During his rule, Montfort called two famous parliaments: the Oxford Parliament stripped Henry of his unlimited authority, while the second included ordinary citizens from the towns. For this reason, Montfort is regarded today as one of the of modern parliamentary democracy. As Earl of Leicester he expelled Jews from that city; as he became ruler of England he also cancelled debts owed to Jews through violent seizures of records. Montfort&#x27;s party massacred the Jews of London, Worcester and Derby, killing scores of Jews from Winchester to Lincoln. After a rule of just over a year, Montfort was killed by forces loyal to the king in the Battle of Evesham.

== Family ==

Montfort was a younger son of Alix de Montmorency and Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester, a French nobleman, and leader of a Crusade against the Cathars in south-west France. His paternal grandmother was Amicia de Beaumont, the senior co-heiress to the Earldom of Leicester and a large estate owned by her brother Robert de Beaumont, 4th Earl of Leicester, in England.

With the irrevocable loss of Normandy, King John refused to allow the elder Simon to succeed to the earldom of Leicester and instead placed the estates and title into the hands of Montfort senior&#x27;s cousin Ranulf, the Earl of Chester. The elder Simon had also acquired vast domains during the Albigensian Crusade, but was killed during the Siege of Toulouse in 1218 and his eldest son Amaury was not able to retain them. When Amaury was rebuffed in his attempt to get the earldom back, he agreed to allow his younger brother Simon to claim it in return for all family possessions in France.

Simon arrived in England in 1229, with some education but no knowledge of English, and received a sympathetic hearing from King Henry III, who became well disposed towards foreigners speaking French, then the language of the English court. Henry was in no position to confront the powerful Earl of Chester, so Simon approached the older, childless man himself and persuaded him to cede him the earldom. It would take another nine years before Henry formally invested him with the title Earl of Leicester.

== Life ==
=== Early life ===
As a younger son, Simon de Montfort attracted little public attention during his youth, and the date of his birth remains unknown. He is first mentioned when his mother made a grant to him in 1217. As a boy, Montfort accompanied his parents during his father&#x27;s campaigns against the Cathars. He was with his mother at the Siege of Toulouse in 1218, where his father died after being struck on the head by a stone pitched by a mangonel. In addition to Amaury, Simon had another older brother, Guy, who was killed at the siege of Castelnaudary in 1220. As a young man, Montfort probably took part in the Albigensian Crusades of the early 1220s. He and Amaury both took part in the Barons&#x27; Crusade.

In 1229 the two surviving brothers (Amaury and Simon) came to an arrangement with King Henry whereby Simon gave up his rights in France and Amaury gave up his rights in England. Thus freed from any allegiance to the king of France, Montfort successfully petitioned for the English inheritance, which he received the next year, although he did not take full possession for several years, and did not win formal recognition as Earl of Leicester until February 1239. Montfort became a favourite of King Henry III and even issued a charter as &quot;Earl of Leicester&quot; in 1236, despite having not yet been granted the title.

In that same year, Simon tried to persuade Joan, Countess of Flanders to marry him. The idea of an alliance between the rich County of Flanders and a close associate of Henry III of England did not sit well with the French crown. The French Queen Dowager Blanche of Castile convinced Joan to marry Thomas II of Savoy instead, who himself became Count of Flanders.

=== Royal marriage ===
In January 1238, Montfort married Eleanor of England, daughter of King John and Isabella of Angoulême and sister of King Henry III. While this marriage took place with the king&#x27;s approval, the act itself was performed secretly and without consulting the great barons, as a marriage of such importance warranted. Eleanor had previously been married to William Marshal, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, and she had sworn a vow of perpetual chastity upon his death, when she was sixteen, which she broke by marrying Montfort.

The archbishop of Canterbury, Edmund Rich, condemned the marriage for this reason. The English nobles protested the marriage of the king&#x27;s sister to a foreigner of modest rank. Most notably, the king&#x27;s and Eleanor&#x27;s brother Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall, rose up in revolt when he learned of the marriage. King Henry eventually bought off Richard with 6,000 marks and peace was restored.

The marriage brought the manor of Sutton Valence in Kent into Montfort&#x27;s possession.

Relations between King Henry and Montfort were cordial at first. Henry lent him his support when Montfort embarked for Rome in March 1238 to seek papal approval for his marriage. When Simon and Eleanor&#x27;s first son was born in November 1238 (despite rumours, more than nine months after the wedding), he was baptised Henry in honour of his royal uncle. In February 1239, Montfort was finally invested with the Earldom of Leicester. He also acted as the king&#x27;s counsellor and was one of the nine godfathers of Henry&#x27;s eldest son, Edward Longshanks.

=== Expulsion of Jews from Leicester ===

As Earl of Leicester, Montfort expelled the small Jewish community from Leicester city in 1231, banishing them &quot;in my time or in the time of any of my heirs to the end of the world&quot;. He justified his action as being &quot;for the good of my soul, and for the souls of my ancestors and successors&quot;. Expelling the Jews enhanced Montfort&#x27;s popularity in his new domains because it removed the practice of usury, which was practised exclusively by Jews (it was forbidden to Christians). Leicester&#x27;s Jews were allowed to move to the eastern suburbs, which were controlled by Montfort&#x27;s great-aunt Margaret, Countess of Winchester.

His parents had shown a similar hostility to Jews in France, where his father had taken part in the Albigensian Crusade, during which his mother had given the Jews of Toulouse a choice of conversion, expulsion or death. Robert Grosseteste – then Archdeacon of Leicester and, according to Matthew Paris, de Montfort&#x27;s confessor – may have encouraged the expulsion, though he is known to have argued that Jews&#x27; lives should be spared.

=== Crusade and turning against the king ===

Shortly after Prince Edward&#x27;s birth in 1239, Montfort fell out with his brother-in-law, Henry III. Montfort owed a great sum of money to Thomas, Count of Flanders, Queen Eleanor&#x27;s uncle, and named King Henry as security for his repayment. The king evidently had not approved this, and was enraged when he discovered that Montfort had used his name. On 9 August 1239, he confronted Montfort, called him an excommunicant and threatened to imprison him in the Tower of London. Matthew Paris reported that Henry said &quot;You seduced my sister and when I discovered this, I gave her to you, against my will, to avoid scandal.&quot; Simon and Eleanor fled to France to escape Henry&#x27;s wrath.

Having announced his intention to go on crusade two years before, Simon raised funds and travelled to the Holy Land during the Barons&#x27; Crusade, but does not seem to have faced combat there. He was part of the crusading host which, under Richard of Cornwall, negotiated the release of Christian prisoners including Simon&#x27;s older brother, Amaury. In autumn 1241, he left Syria and joined King Henry&#x27;s campaign against King Louis IX in Poitou in July 1242. The campaign was a failure, and an exasperated Montfort declared that Henry should be locked up like King Charles the Simple. Like his father, Simon was a soldier as well as a capable administrator. His dispute with King Henry came about due to the latter&#x27;s determination to ignore the swelling discontent within the country, caused by a combination of factors, including famine and a sense, among the English Barons, that King Henry was too quick to dispense favour to his Poitevin relatives and Savoyard in-laws.

In 1248, Montfort again took the cross with the idea of following Louis IX of France to Egypt. However, at the repeated requests of King Henry, he gave up this project in order to act as the king&#x27;s Lieutenant of the Duchy of Aquitaine (Gascony). Bitter complaints were excited by the rigour with which Montfort suppressed the excesses of the Seigneurs and of contending factions in the great communes. Henry yielded to the outcry and instituted a formal inquiry into Simon&#x27;s administration. Simon was formally acquitted on the charges of oppression, but his accounts were disputed by Henry, and Simon retired to France in 1252. The nobles of France offered him the Regency of the kingdom, vacated by the death of Queen Blanche of Castile. The earl preferred to make his peace with Henry III, which he did in 1253, in obedience to the exhortations of the dying Robert Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln. He helped the king deal with disaffection in Gascony, but their reconciliation was a hollow one. In the Parliament of 1254, Simon led the opposition in resisting a royal demand for a subsidy. In 1256–57, when the discontent of all classes was coming to a head, Montfort nominally adhered to the royal cause. He undertook, with Peter of Savoy, the Queen&#x27;s uncle, the difficult task of extricating the king from the pledges which he had given to the Pope with reference to the Crown of Sicily; and Henry&#x27;s writs of this date mention Montfort in friendly terms. However, at the &quot;Mad Parliament&quot; of Oxford (1258) Montfort appeared with the Earl of Gloucester, at the head of the opposition. He was part of the Council of Fifteen who were to constitute the supreme board of control over the administration. The king&#x27;s success in dividing the barons and in fostering a reaction, however, rendered such projects hopeless. In 1261, Henry revoked his assent to the Provisions of Oxford and Montfort, in despair, left the country.

=== War against the king ===

Simon de Montfort returned to England in 1263, at the invitation of the barons who were now convinced of the king&#x27;s hostility to all reform, and raised a rebellion with the avowed object of restoring the form of government which the Provisions had ordained. Cancellation of debts (owed to Jews) was part of his call to arms.

At the time, the King was periodically raising punitive taxation on the Jews, causing them to sell their debt bonds cheaply to raise cash to pay their taxes. The bonds were sold to the richest courtiers at cut down prices, leading many indebted middling landowners to lose their lands. This fed into rising anti-Semitic beliefs, fuelled by the church. Measures against the Jews and controls over debts and usury dominated debates about royal power and finances among the classes that were beginning to be involved in Parliament.

The debt &quot;cancellations&quot; however involved massacres of Jews by his followers, to obtain their financial records, for instance in Worcester and London. The Worcester attack and killings were led by de Montfort&#x27;s son Henry, and Robert Earl Ferrers. In London, one of his key followers John FitzJohn led the attack, and is said to have killed leading Jewish figures Isaac fil Aaron and Cok fil Abraham with his bare hands. He allegedly shared the loot with Montfort. Five hundred Jews died.

His son Simon led a further attack on Jews in Winchester. Jews in Canterbury, were murdered or driven out by a force led by Gilbert de Clare. De Montfort&#x27;s followers massacred most of the Jews who lived in Derby in February 1262. There was further violence in Lincoln, Cambridge, Wilton and Northampton.

Each attack was aimed at the seizure of the records of debts, stored in locked chests within each community, called &#x27;archae&#x27;. Archae were legally mandated by the king for Jews to be allowed to conduct any business. They were destroyed or gathered for instance at Ely by the rebels.

Henry quickly gave in and allowed Montfort to take control of the council. His son Edward, however, began using patronage and bribes to win over many of the barons. Their disruption of parliament in October led to a renewal of hostilities, which saw the royalists able to trap Simon in London. With few other options available, Montfort agreed to allow Louis IX of France to arbitrate their dispute. Simon was prevented from presenting his case to Louis directly on account of a broken leg, but few suspected that the king of France, known for his innate sense of justice, would completely annul the Provisions in his Mise of Amiens in January 1264. Civil war broke out almost immediately, with the royalists again able to confine the reformist army in London. In early May 1264, Simon marched out to give battle to the king and scored a spectacular triumph at the Battle of Lewes on 14 May 1264, capturing the king, together with Prince Edward and Richard of Cornwall, Henry&#x27;s brother and the titular King of Germany.

Montfort announced after the Battle of Lewes that all debts owed to the Jews were cancelled, as he had promised.

=== Rule and parliamentary reform ===

Montfort used his victory to set up a government based on the provisions first established at Oxford in 1258. Henry retained the title and authority of King, but all decisions and approval now rested with his council, led by Montfort and subject to consultation with parliament. His Great Parliament of 1265 (Montfort&#x27;s Parliament) was a packed assembly to be sure, but it can hardly be supposed that the representation which he granted to the towns was intended to be a temporary expedient.

Montfort sent his summons, in the king&#x27;s name, to each county and to a select list of boroughs, asking each to send two representatives. This body was not the first elected parliament in England. In 1254, Henry was in Gascony and in need of money. He gave instructions for his regent, Queen Eleanor, to summon a parliament consisting of knights elected by their shires to ask for this &#x27;aid&#x27;. Montfort, who was in that parliament, took the innovation further by including ordinary citizens from the boroughs, also elected, and it was from this period that parliamentary representation derives. The list of boroughs which had the right to elect a member grew slowly over the centuries as monarchs granted charters to more English towns. (The last charter was given to Newark in 1674.)

The right to vote in Parliamentary elections for county constituencies was uniform throughout the country, related to land ownership. In the Boroughs, the electoral franchise varied and individual boroughs had varying arrangements.

=== Fall from power and death ===

The reaction against Montfort&#x27;s government was baronial rather than popular. The Welsh marcher lords were friends and allies of Prince Edward, and when he escaped in May 1265, they rallied around his opposition. The final nail was the defection of Gilbert de Clare, the Earl of Gloucester, the most powerful baron and Simon&#x27;s ally at Lewes. Clare had grown resentful of Simon&#x27;s fame and growing power. When he and his brother Thomas fell out with Simon&#x27;s sons Henry, Simon the Younger, and Guy, they deserted the reforming cause and joined Edward.

Though boosted by Welsh infantry sent by Montfort&#x27;s ally Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Simon&#x27;s forces were severely depleted. Prince Edward attacked his cousin, his godfather&#x27;s son Simon&#x27;s forces at Kenilworth, capturing more of Montfort&#x27;s allies. Montfort himself had crossed the Severn with his army, intending to rendezvous with his son Simon the Younger. When he saw an army approaching Evesham, Montfort initially thought it was his son&#x27;s forces. It was, however, Edward&#x27;s army flying the Montfort banners they had captured at Kenilworth. At that point, Simon realised he had been out-manoeuvred by Edward.
An ominous black cloud hung over the field of Evesham on 4 August 1265 as Montfort led his army in a desperate uphill charge against superior forces, described by one chronicler as the &quot;murder of Evesham, for battle it was none&quot;. On hearing that his son Henry had been killed, Montfort replied, &quot;Then it is time to die.&quot; Before the battle, Prince Edward had appointed a twelve-man death squad to stalk the battlefield, their sole aim being to find the earl and cut him down. Montfort was hemmed in; Roger Mortimer killed Montfort by stabbing him in the neck with a lance. Montfort&#x27;s last words were said to have been &quot;Thank God&quot;. Also slain with Montfort were other leaders of his movement, including Peter de Montfort and Hugh Despenser.

Montfort&#x27;s body was mutilated in a frenzy by the royalists. News reached the mayor and sheriffs of London that &quot;the head of the earl of Leicester ... was severed from his body, and his testicles cut off and hung on either side of his nose&quot;; and in such guise the head was sent to Wigmore Castle by Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Mortimer, as a gift to his wife, Maud. His hands and feet were also cut off and sent to diverse places to enemies of his as a great mark of dishonour to the deceased. Such remains as could be found were buried before the altar of Evesham Abbey church by the canons. The grave was visited as holy ground by many commoners until King Henry caught wind of it. He declared that Montfort deserved no spot on holy ground, and had his remains reburied in another &quot;secret&quot; location, probably in the crypt. The remains of some of Montfort&#x27;s soldiers who had fled the battlefield were found in the nearby village of Cleeve Prior.

Montfort&#x27;s niece, Margaret of England, later killed one of the soldiers responsible for his death, purposely or inadvertently.

Matthew Paris reports that the Bishop of Lincoln, Robert Grosseteste, once said to Montfort&#x27;s eldest son, Henry, &quot;My beloved child, both you and your father will meet your deaths on one day, and by one kind of death, but it will be in the name of justice and truth.&quot;

== Legacy ==

Following Montfort&#x27;s death, he became the focus of an unofficial popular miracle cult, centred on his grave in Evesham Abbey. It was practised in secret for at least two years because of an official ban, but lasted until 1280, with pilgrims continuing to visit his grave for some years thereafter. The so-called Evesham &quot;miracle book&quot; documents some 200 alleged miracles associated with his name.

Napoleon Bonaparte described Simon de Montfort as &quot;one of the greatest Englishmen&quot;. Today, Montfort is principally remembered as one of the fathers of representative government.
Montfort bears responsibility for persecution of Jews. In addition to his expulsion of Jews from Leicester, his faction in the Second Baron&#x27;s War initiated pogroms killing perhaps the majority of Jews in Derby and Worcester and around 500 in London. The violence and killings unleashed by the war targeting Jews carried on after his death. Jews were living in such terror that King Henry appointed burgesses and citizens of certain towns to protect and defend them because &quot;they fear[ed] grave peril&quot; and were in a &quot;deplorable state.&quot; Leicester City Council made a formal statement in 2001 that &quot;rebuked De Montfort for his blatant anti-Semitism&quot;.

Evesham Abbey and the site of Montfort&#x27;s grave were destroyed with the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century. In 1965, a memorial of stone from Montfort-l&#x27;Amaury was laid on the site of the former altar by Speaker of the House of Commons Sir Harry Hylton-Foster and Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael Ramsey.

Various local honours were dedicated to his memory, and he has become eponymous several times over. De Montfort University in Leicester is named after him, as is the nearby De Montfort Hall, a concert venue. A statue of Montfort is one of four to adorn the Haymarket Memorial Clock Tower in Leicester. A relief of Montfort adorns the wall of the Chamber of the United States House of Representatives.

Montfort&#x27;s banner, known as the &quot;Arms of Honour of Hinckley&quot;, blazoned &quot;Party per pale indented argent and gules&quot;, and displayed in stained glass in Chartres Cathedral, is used in the coat of arms of the town of Hinckley, part of his earldom in Leicestershire, and by many of its local organisations. Combined with his personal coat of arms, the banner forms part of the club crest for the town&#x27;s football club Hinckley A.F.C.

A school and a bridge on the north-east stretch of the A46 in Evesham are named after him.

<doc id="48927" wikidata="Q150445" url="?curid=48927" title="Camille Saint-Saëns">
<text>Charles-Camille Saint-Saëns (, ; ; 9 October 183516 December 1921) was a French composer, organist, conductor and pianist of the Romantic era. His best-known works include Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso (1863), the Second Piano Concerto (1868), the First Cello Concerto (1872), &quot;Danse macabre&quot; (1874), the opera &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; (1877), the Third Violin Concerto (1880), the Third (&quot;Organ&quot;) Symphony (1886) and &quot;The Carnival of the Animals&quot; (1886).

Saint-Saëns was a musical prodigy; he made his concert debut at the age of ten. After studying at the Paris Conservatoire he followed a conventional career as a church organist, first at Saint-Merri, Paris and, from 1858, La Madeleine, the official church of the French Empire. After leaving the post twenty years later, he was a successful freelance pianist and composer, in demand in Europe and the Americas.

As a young man, Saint-Saëns was enthusiastic for the most modern music of the day, particularly that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner, although his own compositions were generally within a conventional classical tradition. He was a scholar of musical history, and remained committed to the structures worked out by earlier French composers. This brought him into conflict in his later years with composers of the impressionist and expressionist schools of music; although there were neoclassical elements in his music, foreshadowing works by Stravinsky and Les Six, he was often regarded as a reactionary in the decades around the time of his death.

Saint-Saëns held only one teaching post, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris, and remained there for less than five years. It was nevertheless important in the development of French music: his students included Gabriel Fauré, among whose own later pupils was Maurice Ravel. Both of them were strongly influenced by Saint-Saëns, whom they revered as a genius.

==Life==
===Early life===
Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, &quot;née&quot; Collin. Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from a Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice, always considered himself a true Parisian. Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption (tuberculosis) on the first anniversary of his marriage. The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil, to the south of Paris.
When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist&#x27;s power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training. Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son&#x27;s precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, &quot;It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart.&quot; The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel, in a programme that included Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto in B (K450), and Beethoven&#x27;s Third Piano Concerto. Through Stamaty&#x27;s influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher Alexandre Pierre François Boëly. From the latter he acquired a lifelong love of the music of Bach, which was then little known in France.

As a schoolboy Saint-Saëns was outstanding in many subjects. In addition to his musical prowess, he distinguished himself in the study of French literature, Latin and Greek, divinity, and mathematics. His interests included philosophy, archaeology and astronomy, of which, particularly the last, he remained a talented amateur in later life.
In 1848, at the age of thirteen, Saint-Saëns was admitted to the Paris Conservatoire, France&#x27;s foremost music academy. The director, Daniel Auber, had succeeded Luigi Cherubini in 1842, and brought a more relaxed regime than that of his martinet predecessor, though the curriculum remained conservative. Students, even outstanding pianists like Saint-Saëns, were encouraged to specialise in organ studies, because a career as a church organist was seen to offer more opportunities than that of a solo pianist. His organ professor was François Benoist, whom Saint-Saëns considered a mediocre organist but a first-rate teacher; his pupils included Adolphe Adam, César Franck, Charles Alkan, Louis Lefébure-Wély and Georges Bizet. In 1849 Saint-Saëns won the Conservatoire&#x27;s second prize for organists, and in 1851 the top prize; in the same year he began formal composition studies. His professor was a protégé of Cherubini, Fromental Halévy, whose pupils included Charles Gounod and Bizet.

Saint-Saëns&#x27;s student compositions included a symphony in A major (1850) and a choral piece, &quot;Les Djinns&quot; (1850), after an eponymous poem by Victor Hugo. He competed for France&#x27;s premier musical award, the Prix de Rome, in 1852 but was unsuccessful. Auber believed that the prize should have gone to Saint-Saëns, considering him to have more promise than the winner, Léonce Cohen, who made little mark during the rest of his career. In the same year Saint-Saëns had greater success in a competition organised by the Société Sainte-Cécile, Paris, with his &quot;Ode à Sainte-Cécile&quot;, for which the judges unanimously voted him the first prize. The first piece the composer acknowledged as a mature work and gave an opus number was &quot;Trois Morceaux&quot; for harmonium (1852).

===Early career===

On leaving the Conservatoire in 1853, Saint-Saëns accepted the post of organist at the ancient Parisian church of Saint-Merri near the . The parish was substantial, with 26,000 parishioners; in a typical year there were more than two hundred weddings, the organist&#x27;s fees from which, together with fees for funerals and his modest basic stipend, gave Saint-Saëns a comfortable income. The organ, the work of François-Henri Clicquot, had been badly damaged in the aftermath of the French Revolution and imperfectly restored. The instrument was adequate for church services but not for the ambitious recitals that many high-profile Parisian churches offered. With enough spare time to pursue his career as a pianist and composer, Saint-Saëns composed what became his opus 2, the Symphony in E (1853). This work, with military fanfares and augmented brass and percussion sections, caught the mood of the times in the wake of the popular rise to power of Napoleon III and the restoration of the French Empire. The work brought the composer another first prize from the Société Sainte-Cécile.

Among the musicians who were quick to spot Saint-Saëns&#x27;s talent were the composers Gioachino Rossini, Hector Berlioz and Franz Liszt, and the influential singer Pauline Viardot, who all encouraged him in his career. In early 1858 Saint-Saëns moved from Saint-Merri to the high-profile post of organist of La Madeleine, the official church of the Empire; Liszt heard him playing there and declared him the greatest organist in the world.

Although in later life he had a reputation for outspoken musical conservatism, in the 1850s Saint-Saëns supported and promoted the most modern music of the day, including that of Liszt, Robert Schumann and Richard Wagner. Unlike many French composers of his own and the next generation, Saint-Saëns, for all his enthusiasm for and knowledge of Wagner&#x27;s operas, was not influenced by him in his own compositions. He commented, &quot;I admire deeply the works of Richard Wagner in spite of their bizarre character. They are superior and powerful, and that is sufficient for me. But I am not, I have never been, and I shall never be of the Wagnerian religion.&quot;

===1860s: Teacher and growing fame===

In 1861 Saint-Saëns accepted his only post as a teacher, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse, Paris, which Louis Niedermeyer had established in 1853 to train first-rate organists and choirmasters for the churches of France. Niedermeyer himself was professor of piano; when he died in March 1861, Saint-Saëns was appointed to take charge of piano studies. He scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner. His best-known pupil, Gabriel Fauré, recalled in old age:

Saint-Saëns further enlivened the academic regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce performed by the students (including André Messager). He conceived what would eventually become his best-known piece, &quot;The Carnival of the Animals&quot;, with his students in mind, but did not finish composing it until 1886, more than twenty years after he left the Niedermeyer school.

In 1864 Saint-Saëns caused some surprise by competing a second time for the Prix de Rome. Many in musical circles were puzzled by his decision to enter the competition again, now that he was establishing a reputation as a soloist and composer. He was once more unsuccessful. Berlioz, one of the judges, wrote:

According to the musical scholar Jean Gallois, it was apropos of this episode that Berlioz made his well-known &quot;bon mot&quot; about Saint-Saëns, &quot;He knows everything, but lacks inexperience&quot; (&quot;Il sait tout, mais il manque d&#x27;inexpérience&quot;). The winner, Victor Sieg, had a career no more notable than that of the 1852 winner, but Saint-Saëns&#x27;s biographer Brian Rees speculates that the judges may &quot;have been seeking signs of genius in the midst of tentative effort and error, and considered that Saint-Saëns had reached his summit of proficiency&quot;. The suggestion that Saint-Saëns was more proficient than inspired dogged his career and posthumous reputation. He himself wrote, &quot;Art is intended to create beauty and character. Feeling only comes afterwards and art can very well do without it. In fact, it is very much better off when it does.&quot; The biographer Jessica Duchen writes that he was &quot;a troubled man who preferred not to betray the darker side of his soul&quot;. The critic and composer Jeremy Nicholas observes that this reticence has led many to underrate the music; he quotes such slighting remarks as &quot;Saint-Saëns is the only great composer who wasn&#x27;t a genius&quot;, and &quot;Bad music well written&quot;.
While teaching at the Niedermeyer school Saint-Saëns put less of his energy into composing and performing, although an overture entitled &quot;Spartacus&quot; was crowned at a competition instituted in 1863 by the Société Sainte Cécile of Bordeaux. But after he left the school in 1865 he pursued both aspects of his career with vigour. In 1867 his cantata &quot;Les noces de Prométhée&quot; beat more than a hundred other entries to win the composition prize of the Grande Fête Internationale in Paris, for which the jury included Auber, Berlioz, Gounod, Rossini and Giuseppe Verdi. In 1868 he premiered the first of his orchestral works to gain a permanent place in the repertoire, his Second Piano Concerto. Playing this and other works he became a noted figure in the musical life of Paris and other cities in France and abroad during the 1860s.

===1870s: War, marriage and operatic success===
In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine, professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music. Before they could take the proposal further the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war. During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed in March to May 1871 his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns escaped to a brief exile in England. With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself in London, giving recitals. Returning to Paris in May, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society. The Société Nationale de Musique, with its motto, &quot;Ars Gallica&quot;, had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc, Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members.
As an admirer of Liszt&#x27;s innovative symphonic poems, Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first &quot;poème symphonique&quot; was &quot;Le Rouet d&#x27;Omphale&quot; (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872. In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. &quot;La princesse jaune&quot; (&quot;The Yellow Princess&quot;), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.

Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother. In 1875, he surprised many by marrying. The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer&#x27;s pupils. The marriage was not a success. In the words of the biographer Sabina Teller Ratner, &quot;Saint-Saëns&#x27;s mother disapproved, and her son was difficult to live with&quot;. Saint-Saëns and his wife moved to the Rue Monsieur-le-Prince, in the Latin Quarter; his mother moved with them. The couple had two sons, both of whom died in infancy. In 1878, the elder, André, aged two, fell from a window of the flat and was killed; the younger, Jean-François, died of pneumonia six weeks later, aged six months. Saint-Saëns and Marie-Laure continued to live together for three years, but he blamed her for André&#x27;s accident; the double blow of their loss effectively destroyed the marriage.
For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music. Saint-Saëns&#x27;s younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful &quot;La princesse jaune&quot; staged, had made no mark in that sphere. In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged. His four-act &quot;drame lyricque&quot;, &quot;Le timbre d&#x27;argent&quot; (&quot;The Silver Bell&quot;), to Jules Barbier&#x27;s and Michel Carré&#x27;s libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production. The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances.

The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy &quot;To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition&quot;. Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died. He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities&#x27; interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities. After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all. He composed a &quot;Messe de Requiem&quot; in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon&#x27;s death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted.

In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success with &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot;, his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt&#x27;s influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation. Although the work eventually became an international success it was not staged at the Paris Opéra until 1892.

Saint-Saëns was a keen traveller. From the 1870s until the end of his life he made 179 trips to 27 countries. His professional engagements took him most often to Germany and England; for holidays, and to avoid Parisian winters which affected his weak chest, he favoured Algiers and various places in Egypt.

===1880s: International figure===
Saint-Saëns was elected to the Institut de France in 1881, at his second attempt, having to his chagrin been beaten by Massenet in 1878. In July of that year he and his wife went to the Auvergnat spa town of La Bourboule for a holiday. On 28 July he disappeared from their hotel, and a few days later his wife received a letter from him to say that he would not be returning. They never saw each other again. Marie Saint-Saëns returned to her family, and lived until 1950, dying near Bordeaux at the age of ninety-five. Saint-Saëns did not divorce his wife and remarry, nor did he form any later intimate relationship with a woman. Rees comments that although there is no firm evidence, some biographers believe that Saint-Saëns was more attracted to his own sex than to women. After the death of his children and collapse of his marriage, Saint-Saëns increasingly found a surrogate family in Fauré and his wife, Marie, and their two sons, to whom he was a much-loved honorary uncle. Marie told him, &quot;For us you are one of the family, and we mention your name ceaselessly here.&quot;
In the 1880s Saint-Saëns continued to seek success in the opera house, an undertaking made the more difficult by an entrenched belief among influential members of the musical establishment that it was unthinkable that a pianist, organist and symphonist could write a good opera. He had two operas staged during the decade, the first being &quot;Henry VIII&quot; (1883) commissioned by the Paris Opéra. Although the libretto was not of his choosing, Saint-Saëns, normally a fluent, even facile composer, worked at the score with unusual diligence to capture a convincing air of 16th-century England. The work was a success, and was frequently revived during the composer&#x27;s lifetime. When it was produced at Covent Garden in 1898, &quot;The Era&quot; commented that though French librettists generally &quot;make a pretty hash of British history&quot;, this piece was &quot;not altogether contemptible as an opera story&quot;.

The open-mindedness of the Société Nationale had hardened by the mid-1880s into a dogmatic adherence to Wagnerian methods favoured by Franck&#x27;s pupils, led by Vincent d&#x27;Indy. They had begun to dominate the organisation and sought to abandon its &quot;Ars Gallica&quot; ethos of commitment to French works. Bussine and Saint-Saëns found this unacceptable, and resigned in 1886. Having long pressed the merits of Wagner on a sometimes sceptical French public, Saint-Saëns was now becoming worried that the German&#x27;s music was having an excessive impact on young French composers. His increasing caution towards Wagner developed in later years into stronger hostility, directed as much at Wagner&#x27;s political nationalism as at his music.

By the 1880s Saint-Saëns was an established favourite with audiences in England, where he was widely regarded as the greatest living French composer. In 1886 the Philharmonic Society of London commissioned what became one of his most popular and respected works, the Third (&quot;Organ&quot;) Symphony. It was premiered in London at a concert in which Saint-Saëns appeared as conductor of the symphony and as soloist in Beethoven&#x27;s Fourth Piano Concerto, conducted by Sir Arthur Sullivan. The success of the symphony in London was considerable, but was surpassed by the ecstatic welcome the work received at its Paris premiere early the following year. Later in 1887 Saint-Saëns&#x27;s &quot;drame lyrique&quot; &quot;Proserpine&quot; opened at the Opéra-Comique. It was well received and seemed to be heading for a substantial run when the theatre burnt down within weeks of the premiere and the production was lost.

In December 1888 Saint-Saëns&#x27;s mother died. He felt her loss deeply, and was plunged into depression and insomnia, even contemplating suicide. He left Paris and stayed in Algiers, where he recuperated until May 1889, walking and reading but unable to compose.

===1890s: Marking time===

During the 1890s Saint-Saëns spent much time on holiday, travelling overseas, composing less and performing more infrequently than before. A planned visit to perform in Chicago fell through in 1893. He wrote one opera, the comedy &quot;Phryné&quot; (1893), and together with Paul Dukas helped to complete &quot;Frédégonde&quot; (1895) an opera left unfinished by Ernest Guiraud, who died in 1892. &quot;Phryné&quot; was well received, and prompted calls for more comic operas at the Opéra-Comique, which had latterly been favouring grand opera. His few choral and orchestral works from the 1890s are mostly short; the major concert pieces from the decade were the single movement fantasia &quot;Africa&quot; (1891) and his Fifth (&quot;Egyptian&quot;) Piano Concerto, which he premiered at a concert in 1896 marking the fiftieth anniversary of his début at the Salle Pleyel in 1846. Before playing the concerto he read out a short poem he had written for the event, praising his mother&#x27;s tutelage and his public&#x27;s long support.

Among the concerts that Saint-Saëns undertook during the decade was one at Cambridge in June 1893, when he, Bruch and Tchaikovsky performed at an event presented by Charles Villiers Stanford for the Cambridge University Musical Society, marking the award of honorary degrees to all three visitors. Saint-Saëns greatly enjoyed the visit, and even spoke approvingly of the college chapel services: &quot;The demands of English religion are not excessive. The services are very short, and consist chiefly of listening to good music extremely well sung, for the English are excellent choristers&quot;. His mutual regard for British choirs continued for the rest of his life, and one of his last large-scale works, the oratorio &quot;The Promised Land&quot;, was composed for the Three Choirs Festival of 1913.

===1900–21: Last years===
In 1900, after ten years without a permanent home in Paris, Saint-Saëns took a flat in the rue de Courcelles, not far from his old residence in the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré. This remained his home for the rest of his life. He continued to travel abroad frequently, but increasingly often to give concerts rather than as a tourist. He revisited London, where he was always a welcome visitor, went to Berlin, where until the First World War, he was greeted with honour, and travelled in Italy, Spain, Monaco and provincial France. In 1906 and 1909 he made highly successful tours of the United States, as a pianist and conductor. In New York on his second visit he premiered his &quot;Praise ye the Lord&quot; for double choir, orchestra and organ, which he composed for the occasion.

Despite his growing reputation as a musical reactionary, Saint-Saëns was, according to Gallois, probably the only French musician who travelled to Munich to hear the premiere of Mahler&#x27;s Eighth Symphony in 1910. Nonetheless, by the 20th century Saint-Saëns had lost much of his enthusiasm for modernism in music. Though he strove to conceal it from Fauré, he did not understand or like the latter&#x27;s opera &quot;Pénélope&quot; (1913), of which he was the dedicatee. In 1917 Francis Poulenc, at the beginning of his career as a composer, was dismissive when Ravel praised Saint-Saëns as a genius. By this time, various strands of new music were emerging with which Saint-Saëns had little in common. His classical instincts for form put him at odds with what seemed to him the shapelessness and structure of the musical impressionists, led by Debussy. Nor did Arnold Schönberg&#x27;s atonality commend itself to Saint-Saëns:

Holding such conservative views, Saint-Saëns was out of sympathy – and out of fashion – with the Parisian musical scene of the early 20th century, fascinated as it was with novelty. It is often said that he walked out, scandalised, from the premiere of Vaslav Nijinsky and Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s ballet &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; in 1913. In fact, according to Stravinsky, Saint-Saëns was not present on that occasion, but at the first concert performance of the piece the following year he expressed the firm view that Stravinsky was insane.

When a group of French musicians led by Saint-Saëns tried to organise a boycott of German music during the First World War, Fauré and Messager dissociated themselves from the idea, though the disagreement did not affect their friendship with their old teacher. They were privately concerned that their friend was in danger of looking foolish with his excess of patriotism, and his growing tendency to denounce in public the works of rising young composers, as in his condemnation of Debussy&#x27;s &quot;En blanc et noir&quot; (1915): &quot;We must at all costs bar the door of the Institut against a man capable of such atrocities; they should be put next to the cubist pictures.&quot; His determination to block Debussy&#x27;s candidacy for election to the Institut was successful, and caused bitter resentment from the younger composer&#x27;s supporters. Saint-Saëns&#x27;s response to the neoclassicism of Les Six was equally uncompromising: of Darius Milhaud&#x27;s polytonal symphonic suite &quot;Protée&quot; (1919) he commented, &quot;fortunately, there are still lunatic asylums in France&quot;.
Saint-Saëns gave what he intended to be his farewell concert as a pianist in Paris in 1913, but his retirement was soon in abeyance as a result of the war, during which he gave many performances in France and elsewhere, raising money for war charities. These activities took him across the Atlantic, despite the danger from German submarines.

In November 1921, Saint-Saëns gave a recital at the Institut for a large invited audience; it was remarked that his playing was as vivid and precise as ever, and that his personal bearing was admirable for a man of eighty-six. He left Paris a month later for Algiers, with the intention of wintering there, as he had long been accustomed to do. While there he died of a heart attack on 16 December 1921. His body was taken back to Paris, and after a state funeral at the Madeleine he was buried at the cimetière du Montparnasse. Heavily veiled, in an inconspicuous place among the mourners from France&#x27;s political and artistic élite, was his widow, Marie-Laure, whom he had last seen in 1881.

==Music==
In the early years of the 20th century, the anonymous author of the article on Saint-Saëns in &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; wrote:

Although a keen modernist in his youth, Saint-Saëns was always deeply aware of the great masters of the past. In a profile of him written to mark his eightieth birthday, the critic DCParker wrote, &quot;That Saint-Saëns knows Rameau... Bach and Handel, Haydn and Mozart, must be manifest to all who are familiar with his writings. His love for the classical giants and his sympathy with them form, so to speak, the foundation of his art.&quot;

Less attracted than some of his French contemporaries to the continuous stream of music popularised by Wagner, Saint-Saëns often favoured self-contained melodies. Though they are frequently, in Ratner&#x27;s phrase, &quot;supple and pliable&quot;, more often than not they are constructed in three- or four-bar sections, and the &quot;phrase pattern AABB is characteristic&quot;. An occasional tendency to neoclassicism, influenced by his study of French baroque music, is in contrast with the colourful orchestral music more widely identified with him. &quot;Grove&quot; observes that he makes his effects more by characterful harmony and rhythms than by extravagant scoring. In both of those areas of his craft he was normally content with the familiar. Rhythmically, he inclined to standard double, triple or compound metres (although &quot;Grove&quot; points to a 5/4 passage in the Piano Trio and another in 7/4 in the Polonaise for two pianos). From his time at the Conservatoire he was a master of counterpoint; contrapuntal passages crop up, seemingly naturally, in many of his works.

===Orchestral works===
The authors of the 1955 &quot;The Record Guide&quot;, Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor write that Saint-Saëns&#x27;s brilliant musicianship was &quot;instrumental in drawing the attention of French musicians to the fact that there are other forms of music besides opera.&quot; In the 2001 edition of &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, Ratner and Daniel Fallon, analysing Saint-Saëns&#x27;s orchestral music rate the unnumbered Symphony in A () as the most ambitious of the composer&#x27;s juvenilia. Of the works of his maturity, the First Symphony (1853) is a serious and large-scale work, in which the influence of Schumann is detectable. The &quot;Urbs Roma&quot; Symphony (1856, unnumbered) in some ways represents a backward step, being less deftly orchestrated, and &quot;thick and heavy&quot; in its effect. Ratner and Fallon praise the Second Symphony (1859) as a fine example of orchestral economy and structural cohesion, with passages that show the composer&#x27;s mastery of fugal writing. The best known of the symphonies is the Third (1886) which, unusually, has prominent parts for piano and organ. It opens in C minor and ends in C major with a stately chorale tune. The four movements are clearly divided into two pairs, a practice Saint-Saëns used elsewhere, notably in the Fourth Piano Concerto (1875) and the First Violin Sonata (1885). The work is dedicated to the memory of Liszt, and uses a recurring &quot;motif&quot; treated in a Lisztian style of thematic transformation.
Saint-Saëns&#x27;s four symphonic poems follow the model of those by Liszt, though, in Sackville-West&#x27;s and Shawe-Taylor&#x27;s view, without the &quot;vulgar blatancy&quot; to which the earlier composer was prone. The most popular of the four is &quot;Danse macabre&quot; (1874) depicting skeletons dancing at midnight. Saint-Saëns generally achieved his orchestral effects by deft harmonisation rather than exotic instrumentation, but in this piece he featured the xylophone prominently, representing the rattling bones of the dancers. &quot;Le Rouet d&#x27;Omphale&quot; (1871) was composed soon after the horrors of the Commune, but its lightness and delicate orchestration give no hint of recent tragedies. Rees rates &quot;Phaëton&quot; (1873) as the finest of the symphonic poems, belying the composer&#x27;s professed indifference to melody, and inspired in its depiction of the mythical hero and his fate. A critic at the time of the premiere took a different view, hearing in the piece &quot;the noise of a hack coming down from Montmartre&quot; rather than the galloping fiery horses of Greek legend that inspired the piece. The last of the four symphonic poems, &quot;La jeunesse d&#x27;Hercule&quot; (&quot;Hercules&#x27;s Youth&quot;, 1877) was the most ambitious of the four, which, Harding suggests, is why it is the least successful. In the judgment of the critic Roger Nichols these orchestral works, which combine striking melodies, strength of construction and memorable orchestration &quot;set new standards for French music and were an inspiration to such young composers as Ravel&quot;.

Saint-Saëns wrote a one-act ballet, &quot;Javot&quot; (1896), the score for the film &quot;L&#x27;assassinat du duc de Guise&quot; (1908), and incidental music to a dozen plays between 1850 and 1916. Three of these scores were for revivals of classics by Molière and Racine, for which Saint-Saëns&#x27;s deep knowledge of French baroque scores was reflected in his scores, in which he incorporated music by Lully and Charpentier.

===Concertante works===
Saint-Saëns was the first major French composer to write piano concertos. His First, in D (1858), in conventional three-movement form, is not well known, but the Second, in G minor (1868) is one of his most popular works. The composer experimented with form in this piece, replacing the customary sonata form first movement with a more discursive structure, opening with a solemn cadenza. The scherzo second movement and &quot;presto&quot; finale are in such contrast with the opening that the pianist Zygmunt Stojowski commented that the work &quot;begins like Bach and ends like Offenbach&quot;. The Third Piano Concerto, in E (1869) has another high-spirited finale, but the earlier movements are more classical, the texture clear, with graceful melodic lines. The Fourth, in C minor (1875) is probably the composer&#x27;s best-known piano concerto after the Second. It is in two movements, each comprising two identifiable sub-sections, and maintains a thematic unity not found in the composer&#x27;s other piano concertos. According to some sources it was this piece that so impressed Gounod that he dubbed Saint-Saëns &quot;the Beethoven of France&quot; (other sources base that distinction on the Third Symphony). The Fifth and last piano concerto, in F major, was written in 1896, more than twenty years after its predecessor. The work is known as the &quot;Egyptian&quot; concerto; it was written while the composer was wintering in Luxor, and incorporates a tune he heard Nile boatmen singing.

The First Cello Concerto, in A minor (1872) is a serious although animated work, in a single continuous movement with an unusually turbulent first section. It is among the most popular concertos in the cello repertory, much favoured by Pablo Casals and later players. The Second, in D minor (1902), like the Fourth Piano Concerto, consists of two movements each subdivided into two distinct sections. It is more purely virtuosic than its predecessor: Saint-Saëns commented to Fauré that it would never be as popular as the First because it was too difficult. There are three violin concertos; the first to be composed dates from 1858 but was not published until 1879, as the composer&#x27;s Second, in C major. The First, in A, was also completed in 1858. It is a short work, its single 314-bar movement lasting less than a quarter of an hour. The Second, in conventional three-movement concerto form, is twice as long as the First, and is the least popular of the three: the thematic catalogue of the composer&#x27;s works lists only three performances in his lifetime. The Third, in B minor, written for Pablo de Sarasate, is technically challenging for the soloist, although the virtuoso passages are balanced by intervals of pastoral serenity. It is by some margin the most popular of the three violin concertos, but Saint-Saëns&#x27;s best-known concertante work for violin and orchestra is probably the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso, in A minor, Op. 28, a single-movement piece, also written for Sarasate, dating from 1863. It changes from a wistful and tense opening to a swaggering main theme, described as faintly sinister by the critic Gerald Larner, who goes on, &quot;After a multi-stopped cadenza ... the solo violin makes a breathless sprint through the coda to the happy ending in A major&quot;.

===Operas===

Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud&#x27;s unfinished &quot;Frédégonde&quot;, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are &quot;opéras comiques&quot;. During the composer&#x27;s lifetime his &quot;Henry VIII&quot; became a repertory piece; since his death only &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot; has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, &quot;Ascanio&quot; (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns &quot;lacked the &#x27;nose&#x27; of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior&quot;. In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: &quot;Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet&#x27;s histrionics&quot;. Saint-Saëns&#x27;s biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of &quot;La princesse jaune&quot;, which Harding describes as like Sullivan &quot;with a light French touch&quot;.

Although most of Saint-Saëns&#x27;s operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as &quot;a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s&quot;. In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – &quot;lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.&quot; Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for &quot;Henry VIII&quot; he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in &quot;La princesse jaune&quot; he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less variety of tempo within individual numbers. In a survey of recorded opera Alan Blyth writes that Saint-Saëns &quot;certainly learned much from Handel, Gluck, Berlioz, the Verdi of &quot;Aida&quot;, and Wagner, but from these excellent models he forged his own style.&quot;

===Other vocal music===

From the age of six and for the rest of his life Saint-Saëns composed &quot;mélodies&quot;, writing more than 140. He regarded his songs as thoroughly and typically French, denying any influence from Schubert or other German composers of &quot;Lieder&quot;. Unlike his protégé Fauré, or his rival Massenet, he was not drawn to the song cycle, writing only two during his long career – &quot;Mélodies persanes&quot; (&quot;Persian Songs&quot;, 1870) and &quot;Le Cendre rouge&quot; (&quot;The Red Ash Tree&quot;, 1914, dedicated to Fauré). The poet whose works he set most often was Victor Hugo; others included Alphonse de Lamartine, Pierre Corneille, Amable Tastu, and, in eight songs, Saint-Saëns himself: among his many non-musical talents he was an amateur poet. He was highly sensitive to word setting, and told the young composer Lili Boulanger that to write songs effectively musical talent was not enough: &quot;you must study the French language in depth; it is indispensable.&quot; Most of the &quot;mélodies&quot; are written for piano accompaniment, but a few, including &quot;Le lever du soleil sur le Nil&quot; (&quot;Sunrise over the Nile&quot;, 1898) and &quot;Hymne à la paix&quot; (&quot;Hymn to Peace&quot;, 1919), are for voice and orchestra. His settings, and chosen verses, are generally traditional in form, contrasting with the free verse and less structured forms of a later generation of French composers, including Debussy.

Saint-Saëns composed more than sixty sacred vocal works, ranging from motets to masses and oratorios. Among the larger-scale compositions are the Requiem (1878) and the oratorios &quot;Le déluge&quot; (1875) and &quot;The Promised Land&quot; (1913) with an English text by Herman Klein. He was proud of his connection with British choirs, commenting, &quot;One likes to be appreciated in the home, &quot;par excellence&quot;, of oratorio.&quot; He wrote a smaller number of secular choral works, some for unaccompanied choir, some with piano accompaniment and some with full orchestra. In his choral works, Saint-Saëns drew heavily on tradition, feeling that his models should be Handel, Mendelssohn and other earlier masters of the genre. In Klein&#x27;s view, this approach was old-fashioned, and the familiarity of Saint-Saëns&#x27;s treatment of the oratorio form impeded his success in it.

===Solo keyboard===
Nichols comments that, although as a famous pianist Saint-Saëns wrote for the piano throughout his life, &quot;this part of his oeuvre has made curiously little mark&quot;. Nichols excepts the &quot;Étude en forme de valse&quot; (1912), which he observes still attracts pianists eager to display their left-hand technique. Although Saint-Saëns was dubbed &quot;the French Beethoven&quot;, and his Variations on a Theme of Beethoven in E (1874) is his most extended work for unaccompanied piano, he did not emulate his predecessor in composing piano sonatas. He is not known even to have contemplated writing one. There are sets of bagatelles (1855), études (two sets – 1899 and 1912) and fugues (1920), but in general Saint-Saëns&#x27;s works for the piano are single short pieces. In addition to established forms such as the song without words (1871) and the mazurka (1862, 1871 and 1882) popularised by Mendelssohn and Chopin, respectively, he wrote descriptive pieces such as &quot;Souvenir d&#x27;Italie&quot; (1887), &quot;Les cloches du soir&quot; (&quot;Evening bells&quot;, 1889) and &quot;Souvenir d&#x27;Ismaïlia&quot; (1895).
Unlike his pupil, Fauré, whose long career as a reluctant organist left no legacy of works for the instrument, Saint-Saëns published a modest number of pieces for organ solo. Some of them were written for use in church services – &quot;Offertoire&quot; (1853), &quot;Bénédiction nuptiale&quot; (1859), &quot;Communion&quot; (1859) and others. After he left the Madeleine in 1877 Saint-Saëns wrote ten more pieces for organ, mostly for concert use, including two sets of preludes and fugues (1894 and 1898). Some of the earlier works were written to be played on either the harmonium or the organ, and a few were primarily intended for the former.

===Chamber===
Saint-Saëns wrote more than forty chamber works between the 1840s and his last years. One of the first of his major works in the genre was the Piano Quintet (1855). It is a straightforward, confident piece, in a conventional structure with lively outer movements and a central movement containing two slow themes, one chorale-like and the other &quot;cantabile&quot;. The Septet (1880), for the unusual combination of trumpet, two violins, viola, cello, double bass and piano, is a neoclassical work that draws on 17th-century French dance forms. At the time of its composition Saint-Saëns was preparing new editions of the works of baroque composers including Rameau and Lully. The &quot;Caprice sur des airs danois et russes&quot; (1887) for flute, oboe, clarinet and piano, and the Barcarolle in F major (1898) for violin, cello, harmonium and piano are further examples of Saint-Saëns&#x27;s sometimes unorthodox instrumentation.

In Ratner&#x27;s view, the most important of Saint-Saëns&#x27;s chamber works are the sonatas: two for violin, two for cello, and one each for oboe, clarinet and bassoon, all seven with piano accompaniment. The First Violin Sonata dates from 1885, and is rated by &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; as one of the composer&#x27;s best and most characteristic compositions. The Second (1896) signals a stylistic change in Saint-Saëns&#x27;s work, with a lighter, clearer sound for the piano, characteristic of his music from then onwards. The First Cello Sonata (1872) was written after the death of the composer&#x27;s great-aunt, who had taught him to play the piano more than thirty years earlier. It is a serious work, in which the main melodic material is sustained by the cello over a virtuoso piano accompaniment. Fauré called it the only cello sonata from any country to be of any importance. The Second (1905) is in four movements, and has the unusual feature of a theme and variations as its scherzo.
The woodwind sonatas are among the composer&#x27;s last works and part of his efforts to expand the repertoire for instruments for which hardly any solo parts were written, as he confided to his friend Jean Chantavoine in a letter dated to 15 April 1921: &quot;At the moment I am concentrating my last reserves on giving rarely considered instruments the chance to be heard.&quot; Ratner writes of them, &quot;The spare, evocative, classical lines, haunting melodies, and superb formal structures underline these beacons of the neoclassical movement.&quot; Gallois comments that the Oboe Sonata begins like a conventional classical sonata, with an andantino theme; the central section has rich and colourful harmonies, and the molto allegro finale is full of delicacy, humour and charm with a form of tarantella. For Gallois the Clarinet Sonata is the most important of the three: he calls it &quot;a masterpiece full of impishness, elegance and discreet lyricism&quot; amounting to &quot;a summary of the rest&quot;. The work contrasts a &quot;doleful threnody&quot; in the slow movement with the finale, which &quot;pirouettes in 4/4 time&quot;, in a style reminiscent of the 18th century. The same commentator calls the Bassoon Sonata &quot;a model of transparency, vitality and lightness&quot;, containing humorous touches but also moments of peaceful contemplation. Saint-Saëns also expressed an intention to write a sonata for the cor anglais, but did not do so.

The composer&#x27;s most famous work, &quot;The Carnival of the Animals&quot; (1887), although far from a typical chamber piece, is written for eleven players, and is considered by &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; to be part of Saint-Saëns&#x27;s chamber output. &quot;Grove&quot; rates it as &quot;his most brilliant comic work, parodying Offenbach, Berlioz, Mendelssohn, Rossini, his own &quot;Danse macabre&quot; and several popular tunes&quot;. He forbade performances of it during his lifetime, concerned that its frivolity would damage his reputation as a serious composer.

===Recordings===
Saint-Saëns was a pioneer in recorded music. In June 1904 The Gramophone Company of London sent its producer Fred Gaisberg to Paris to record Saint-Saëns as accompanist to the mezzo-soprano Meyriane Héglon in arias from &quot;Ascanio&quot; and &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot;, and as soloist in his own piano music, including an arrangement of sections of the Second Piano Concerto (without orchestra). Saint-Saëns made more recordings for the company in 1919.

In the early days of the LP record, Saint-Saëns&#x27;s works were patchily represented on disc. &quot;The Record Guide&quot; (1955) lists one recording apiece of the Third Symphony, Second Piano Concerto and First Cello Concerto, alongside several versions of &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;, &quot;The Carnival of the Animals&quot;, the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso and other short orchestral works. In the latter part of the 20th century and the early 21st, many more of the composer&#x27;s works were released on LP and later CD and DVD. The 2008 &quot;Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music&quot; contains ten pages of listings of Saint-Saëns works, including all the concertos, symphonies, symphonic poems, sonatas and quartets. Also listed are an early Mass, collections of organ music, and choral songs. A recording of twenty-seven of Saint-Saëns&#x27;s &quot;mélodies&quot; was released in 1997.

With the exception of &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot; the operas have been sparsely represented on disc. A recording of &quot;Henry VIII&quot; was issued on CD and DVD in 1992. &quot;Hélène&quot; was released on CD in 2008. There are several recordings of &quot;Samson et Dalilah&quot;, under conductors including Sir Colin Davis, Georges Prêtre, Daniel Barenboim and Myung-Whun Chung. In the early 2020s the Centre de musique romantique française&#x27;s Bru Zane label issued new recordings of &quot;Le Timbre d&#x27;argent&quot; (conducted by François-Xavier Roth, 2020), &quot;La Princesse jaune&quot; (Leo Hussain, 2021), and &quot;Phryné&quot; (Hervé Niquet, 2022).

==Honours and reputation==
Saint-Saëns was made a &quot;Chevalier&quot; of the Legion of Honour in 1867 and promoted to &quot;Officier&quot; in 1884, and &quot;Grand Croix&quot; in 1913. Foreign honours included the British Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in 1902, the Monégasque Order of Saint-Charles in 1904 and honorary doctorates from the universities of Cambridge (1893) and Oxford (1907).

In its obituary notice, &quot;The Times&quot; commented:
In a short poem, &quot;Mea culpa&quot;, published in 1890 Saint-Saëns accused himself of lack of decadence, and commented approvingly on the excessive enthusiasms of youth, lamenting that such things were not for him. An English commentator quoted the poem in 1910, observing, &quot;His sympathies are with the young in their desire to push forward, because he has not forgotten his own youth when he championed the progressive ideals of the day.&quot; The composer sought a balance between innovation and traditional form. The critic Henry Colles, wrote, a few days after the composer&#x27;s death:
&quot;Grove&quot; concludes its article on Saint-Saëns with the observation that although his works are remarkably consistent, &quot;it cannot be said that he evolved a distinctive musical style. Rather, he defended the French tradition that threatened to be engulfed by Wagnerian influences and created the environment that nourished his successors&quot;.

Since the composer&#x27;s death writers sympathetic to his music have expressed regret that he is known by the musical public for only a handful of his scores such as &quot;The Carnival of the Animals&quot;, the Second Piano Concerto, the Third Violin Concerto, the Organ Symphony, &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot;, &quot;Danse macabre&quot; and the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso. Among his large output, Nicholas singles out the Requiem, the Christmas Oratorio, the ballet &quot;Javotte&quot;, the Piano Quartet, the Septet for trumpet, piano and strings, and the First Violin Sonata as neglected masterpieces. In 2004, the cellist Steven Isserlis said, &quot;Saint-Saens is exactly the sort of composer who needs a festival to himself ... there are Masses, all of which are interesting. I&#x27;ve played all his cello music and there isn&#x27;t one bad piece. His works are rewarding in every way. And he&#x27;s an endlessly fascinating figure.&quot;

<text>Dressage ( or ; , most commonly translated as &quot;training&quot;) is a form of horse riding performed in exhibition and competition, as well as an art sometimes pursued solely for the sake of mastery. As an equestrian sport defined by the International Equestrian Federation, dressage is described as &quot;the highest expression of horse training&quot; where &quot;horse and rider are expected to perform from memory a series of predetermined movements&quot;.

Competitions are held at all levels from amateur to the Olympic Games and World Equestrian Games. Its fundamental purpose is to develop, through standardized progressive training methods, a horse&#x27;s natural athletic ability and willingness to perform, thereby maximizing its potential as a riding horse. At the peak of a dressage horse&#x27;s gymnastic development, the horse responds smoothly to a skilled rider&#x27;s minimal aids. The rider is relaxed and appears effort-free while the horse willingly performs the requested movement.

The discipline has a rich history with ancient roots in the writings of Xenophon. Modern dressage has evolved as an important equestrian pursuit since the Renaissance when Federico Grisone&#x27;s &quot;The Rules of Riding&quot; was published in 1550, one of the first notable European treatises on equitation since Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;On Horsemanship&quot;. Much about training systems used today reflects practices of classical dressage.

In modern dressage competition, successful training at the various levels is demonstrated through the performance of &quot;tests&quot;, prescribed series of movements ridden within a standard arena. Judges evaluate each movement on the basis of a standard appropriate to the level of the test and assign each movement a score from zero to ten – zero being &quot;not executed&quot; and 10 being &quot;excellent&quot;. A competitor achieving all 6s (or 60% overall) might typically then move up to the next level.

== Dressage horses ==
The most popular horse breeds seen at the Olympics and other international FEI competitions are warmblood horses bred for dressage.

In classical dressage training and performances that involve the &quot;airs above the ground&quot; (&quot;described below&quot;), the &quot;baroque&quot; breeds of horses are popular and purposely bred for these specialties.

== Arena ==
There are two sizes of arenas, small and standard. Each has letters assigned to positions around the arena for dressage tests to specify where movements are to be performed. Cones with letters on them are positioned on the sidelines of the arena for reference as to where a movement is to be performed.

The small arena is and is used for the lower levels of eventing in the dressage phase, as well as for some pure dressage competitions at lower levels. Its letters around the outside edge, starting from the point of entry and moving clockwise, are A-K-E-H-C-M-B-F. Letters also mark locations along the &quot;center line&quot; in the middle of the arena. Moving down the center line from A, they are D-X-G, with X being directly between E and B.
The standard arena is , and is used for tests in both pure dressage and eventing. The standard dressage arena letters are A-K-V-E-S-H-C-M-R-B-P-F. The letters on the long sides of the arena, nearest the corners, are in from the corners, and are apart from each other. The letters along the center line are D-L-X-I-G, with X again being halfway down the arena. There is speculation as to why these letters were chosen.

In addition to the center line, the arena also has two &quot;quarter lines&quot;, which lie between the center line and the long side of the arena. However, these are infrequently, if ever, used for competition except in a freestyle.

At the start of the test, the horse enters the arena at an opening at A. Ideally this opening is then closed for the duration of the test. However, this is not always logistically possible, particularly at smaller competitions with few volunteers.

==Judges==
Judges are registered through their national federation depending on the judge&#x27;s experience and training, with the highest qualified being registered with the FEI for international competition. Judges are strictly regulated to ensure as consistent marking as possible within the limits of subjectivity, and in FEI competitions, it is expected that all judges&#x27; final percentage be within five percent of each other.

There is always a judge sitting at C, although for upper-level competition there can be up to seven judges at different places around the arena — at C, E, B, K, F, M, and H — which allows the horse to be seen in each movement from all angles. This helps prevent certain faults from going unnoticed, which may be difficult for a judge to see from only one area of the arena. For example, the horse&#x27;s straightness going across the diagonal may be assessed by judges at M and H.

Although the judge&#x27;s positions are known by their closest letter, only C, B, &amp; E are actually directly behind their respective marker, with the other judges being on the short sides (on a plane with C, and two metres in from the edge of the arena for M &amp; H, and at the A end of the arena and five metres in from the long side of the arena for F &amp; K) rather than on the long side where the letter would seem to indicate.

== Competition ==

Dressage competitions consist of a series of individual tests with an increasing level of difficulty. The most accomplished horse and rider teams perform FEI tests, written by the international equestrian governing body called the Fédération Équestre Internationale or FEI. The highest level of modern competition is at the Grand Prix level. This is the level test ridden in the prestigious international competitions (CDIs), such as the Olympic games, Dressage World Cup, and World Equestrian Games. Dressage governed by the rules of the FEI include the following levels: &quot;small tour&quot; (Prix St. Georges and Intermediate I) Intermediate A, Intermediate B and &quot;big tour&quot; (Intermediate II, Grand Prix and Grand Prix Special).

In addition, there are four to six lower levels, occasionally more, regulated in individual nations by their respective national federation (such as the USDF in America, British Dressage, Dressage Australia etc.). The lower levels ask horses for basic gaits, relatively large circles, and a lower level of collection than the international levels. Lateral movements are not required in the earliest levels, and movements such as the leg yield, shoulder-in, or haunches-in are gradually introduced as the horse progresses, until the point at which the horse can compete in the FEI levels.

Apart from competition, there is the tradition of classical dressage, in which the traditional training of dressage is pursued as an art form. The traditions of the masters who originated Dressage are kept alive by the Spanish Riding School in Vienna, Austria, Escola Portuguesa de Arte Equestre in Lisbon, Portugal, and the &quot;Cadre Noir&quot; in Saumur, France. This type of schooling is also a part of Portuguese and Spanish bullfighting exhibitions.

=== Tests ===
Dressage tests are the formalized sequence of a number of dressage movements used in competition. Although horses and riders are competing against each other, tests are completed by one horse and rider combination at a time, and horses and riders are judged against a common standard, rather than having their performance scored relative to the other competitors.

At the upper levels, tests for international competitions, including the Olympics, are issued under the auspices of the FEI. At the lower levels, and as part of dressage training each country authorizes its own set of tests. For example, in the US it is the United States Equestrian Federation and the United States Dressage Federation. In Great Britain, dressage is overseen by British Dressage. Pony Clubs also produce their own tests, including basic walk/trot tests which cater for child riders.

Each test is segmented into a number of sequential blocks which may contain one or more movements. Each block is generally scored between zero and ten on a scale such as the following:
*10 Excellent
*9 Very good
*8 Good
*7 Fairly good
*6 Satisfactory
*5 Marginal
*4 Insufficient
*3 Fairly Bad
*2 Bad
*1 Very bad
*0 Not executed

Since 2011, all international tests, and some national tests have also allowed half marks (0.5 – 9.5) in all blocks.

Along with each mark a &quot;comment&quot; may be given, which can describe things a rider and horse lack during the movement, or what they have. Any of the definitions of each numeric mark can only be used in the comment if the mark corresponds with the definition.

In addition to marks for the dressage movements, marks are also awarded for more general attributes such as the horse&#x27;s gaits, submission, impulsion and the rider&#x27;s performance. Some segments are given increased weight by the use of a multiplier, or coefficient. Coefficients are typically given a value of 2, which then doubles the marks given for that segment. Movements that are given a coefficient are generally considered to be particularly important to the horse&#x27;s progression in training, and should be competently executed prior to moving up to the next level of competition. The scores for the general attributes of gait, submission, impulsion, and rider performance mentioned above are scored using a coefficient.

=== Scribing ===
Scribing (also known as pencilling or writing) is the writing down of the scores and comments of judges at dressage events so that the judge can concentrate on the performance. In addition to this, the scribe should check the identity of each competitor, and ensure that the test papers are complete and signed before handing them to the scorers. The scribe should have some knowledge of dressage terminology, be smartly dressed and have legible handwriting. The scribe should also be professional in manner, neutral and not engage in small talk or make comments. It is permissible to use abbreviations provided they are accepted and intelligible.

According to the United States Dressage Federation, &quot;Anyone can volunteer at a schooling show to scribe. Schooling shows are not recognized as official shows but are a great way to practice riding tests or to learn to scribe for a judge. Once you have scribed at a schooling show and at the lower levels, you may ask to scribe at a recognized show and perhaps even the FEI levels of competition.&quot; Scribing or pencilling is also an integral part of a judge&#x27;s training as they look to become accredited or upgrade to a higher level.

== International level ==
At the international level, dressage tests governed by the FEI are the Prix St. Georges, Intermediare I, Intermediare II, and Grand Prix. The dressage tests performed at the Olympic Games dressage competition are Grand Prix. This level of testing demands the most skill and concentration from both horse and rider.

Movements included in Grand Prix dressage tests are:

; Piaffe : A calm, composed, collected, and elevated trot in place (although minimal movement forward is allowed and not penalized in competitions as it is the natural way of performing the movement. In any case the horse should never move backwards and this is considered a serious fault): 
; Passage : A very collected trot, in which the horse has great elevation of stride and seems to pause between each stride (it has a great amount of suspension in the stride). A higher degree of collection causes a definite shift of impulsion to the hindquarters. &quot;An understanding of load distribution between forelimbs and hindlimbs in relation to different riding techniques is vital to prevent wear-and-tear on the locomotor apparatus&quot;.

; Extended gaits : Usually done at the trot and canter, the horse lengthens its stride to the maximum length through great forward thrust and reach. Grand Prix horses show amazing trot extensions. Though not as visually impressive, equally important is the extended walk, which shows that the horse can easily relax and stretch in the midst of the more collected movements.

; Collected gaits (trot and canter) : A shortening of stride in which the horse brings its hindquarters more underneath himself and carries more weight on his hind end. The tempo does not change, the horse simply shortens and elevates his stride.

; Flying changes in sequence: Informally called &quot;tempis&quot; or &quot;tempi changes&quot; at this level, The horse changes leads at the canter every stride (one time tempis or &quot;oneseys&quot;), two strides (two time tempis), three strides or four strides.

; Pirouette : A 360 degree turn in place, usually performed at the canter. In a Freestyle to music (kür) test, a turn of up to 720° is permissible for Grand Prix. (In levels lower than Grand Prix, a 180 degree pirouette may be performed.)

; Half-pass : A movement where the horse goes on a diagonal, moving sideways and forward at the same time, while bent slightly in the direction of movement.

Tests ridden at the Olympic Games are scored by a panel of seven international judges. Each movement in each test receives a numeric score from 0 (lowest) to 10 (highest) and the resulting final score is then converted into a percentage, which is carried out to three decimal points. The higher the percentage, the higher the score. However, in eventing dressage the score is calculated by dividing the number of points achieved by the total possible points, then multiplied by 100 (rounded to 2 decimal points) and subtracted from 100. Thus, a lower score is better than a higher score.

Olympic team medals are won by the teams with the highest combined percentages from their best three rides in the Grand Prix test.

Once the team medals are determined, horses and riders compete for individual medals. The team competition serves as the first individual qualifier, in that the top 25 horse/rider combinations from the Grand Prix test move on to the next round. The second individual qualifier is the Grand Prix Special test, which consists of Grand Prix movements arranged in a different pattern. For those 25 riders, the scores from the Grand Prix and the Grand Prix Special are then combined and the resulting top 15 horse/rider combinations move on to the individual medal competition—the crowd-pleasing Grand Prix Freestyle to Music (Kür).

For their freestyles, riders and horses perform specially choreographed patterns to music. At this level, the freestyle tests may contain all the Grand Prix movements, as well as double canter pirouettes, pirouettes in piaffe, and half-pass in passage. For the freestyle, judges award technical marks for the various movements, as well as artistic marks. In the case of a tie, the ride with the higher artistic marks wins.

== Training scale ==
Competitive dressage training in the U.S. is based on a progression of six steps developed by the German National Equestrian Foundation. This system is arranged in a pyramid or sequential fashion, with &quot;rhythm and regularity&quot; at the start of the pyramid and &quot;collection&quot; at the end. The training scale is helpful and effective as a guide for the training of any horse, but has come to be most closely associated with dressage. Despite its appearance, the training scale is not meant to be a rigid format. Instead, each level is built on as the horse progresses in training: so a Grand Prix horse would work on the refinement of the first levels of the pyramid, instead of focusing on only the final level: &quot;collection.&quot; The levels are also interconnected. For example, a crooked horse cannot develop impulsion, and a horse that is not relaxed will be less likely to travel with a rhythmic gait. However, this training scale as presented below is a translation from the German to the English.

=== Rhythm and regularity (&quot;Takt&quot;) ===
Rhythm, gait, tempo, and regularity should be the same on straight and bending lines, through lateral work, and through transitions. Rhythm refers to the sequence of the footfalls, which should only include the pure walk, pure trot, and pure canter. The regularity, or purity, of the gait includes the evenness and levelness of the stride. Once a rider can obtain pure gaits, or can avoid irregularity, the combination may be fit to do a more difficult exercise. Even in the very difficult piaffe there is still regularity: the horse &quot;trots on the spot&quot; in place, raising the front and hind legs in rhythm.

=== Relaxation (&quot;Losgelassenheit&quot;) ===
The second level of the pyramid is relaxation (looseness). Signs of looseness in the horse may be seen by an even stride that is swinging through the back and causing the tail to swing like a pendulum, looseness at the poll, a soft chewing of the bit, and a relaxed blowing through the nose. The horse makes smooth transitions, is easy to position from side to side, and willingly reaches down into the contact as the reins are lengthened.

=== Contact (&quot;Anlehnung&quot;) ===
Contact—the third level of the pyramid—is the result of the horse&#x27;s pushing power, and should never be achieved by the pulling of the rider&#x27;s hands. The rider encourages the horse to stretch into soft hands that allow the horse to lift the base of the neck, coming up into the bridle, and should always follow the natural motion of the animal&#x27;s head. The horse should have equal contact in both reins.

=== Impulsion (&quot;Schwung&quot;) ===

The pushing power (thrust) of the horse is called impulsion, and is the fourth level of the training pyramid. Impulsion is created by storing the energy of engagement (the forward reaching of the hind legs under the body).

Proper impulsion is achieved by means of:
*Correct driving aids of the rider
*Relaxation of the horse
* Throughness (&quot;Durchlässigkeit&quot;): the flow of energy through the horse from front to back and back to front. The musculature of the horse is connected, supple, elastic, and unblocked, and the rider&#x27;s aids go freely through the horse.

Impulsion can occur at the walk, trot and canter. It is highly important to establish good, forward movement and impulsion at the walk, as achieving desirable form in the trot and canter relies heavily on the transition from a good, supple, forward walk.

Impulsion not only encourages correct muscle and joint use, but also engages the mind of the horse, focusing it on the rider and, particularly at the walk and trot, allowing for relaxation and dissipation of nervous energy.

=== Straightness (&quot;Geraderichtung&quot;) ===
A horse is straight when the hind legs follow the path of the front legs, on both straight lines and on bending lines, and the body follows the line of travel. Straightness allows the horse to channel its impulsion directly toward its center of balance, and allows the rider&#x27;s hand aids to have a connection to the hind end.
When working on straightness in the horse, a common exercise is used called &#x27;shoulder in&#x27;. The exercise is the beginning of straightness in the horse as well as collection and can increase impulsion in the horse.

=== Collection (&quot;Versammlung&quot;) ===
At the apex of the training scale stands collection. It may refer to collected gaits: they can be used occasionally to supplement less vigorous work. It involves difficult movements (such as flying changes) in more advanced horses. Collection requires greater muscular strength, so must be advanced upon slowly. When in a collected gait, the stride length should shorten, and the stride should increase in energy and activity.

When a horse collects, more weight moves to the hindquarters. Collection is natural for horses and is often seen during pasture play. A collected horse can move more freely. The joints of the hind limbs have greater flexion, allowing the horse to lower the hindquarters, bringing the hind legs further under the body, and lighten and lift the forehand. In essence, collection is the horse&#x27;s ability to move its centre of gravity to the rear while lifting the freespan of its back to better round under the rider.

== &quot;Airs&quot; above the ground ==


The &quot;school jumps&quot;, or &quot;airs above the ground&quot;, are a series of higher-level classical dressage movements where the horse leaves the ground. These include the capriole, courbette, the mezair, the croupade, and levade. None are used in modern competitive dressage, but are performed by horses of various riding academies, including the Spanish Riding School in Vienna, Escola Portuguesa de Arte Equestre in Lisbon, Portugal, and the Cadre Noir in Saumur. Baroque horse breeds such as the Andalusian, Lusitano and Lipizzan are most often trained to perform the &quot;airs&quot; today, in part due to their powerfully conformed hindquarters, which allow them the strength to perform these difficult movements.

There is a popular belief that these moves were originally taught to horses for military purposes, and indeed both the Spanish Riding School and the Cadre Noir are military foundations. However, while agility was necessary on the battlefield, most of the airs as performed today would have actually exposed horses&#x27; vulnerable underbellies to the weapons of foot soldiers. It is therefore more likely that the airs were exercises to develop the agility, responsiveness and physiology of the military horse and rider, rather than to be employed in combat.

== Dressage masters ==

The earliest practitioner who wrote treatises that survive today that describe sympathetic and systematic training of the horse was the Greek general Xenophon (427–355 BC). Despite living over 2000 years ago, his ideas are still widely praised. Beginning in the Renaissance a number of early modern trainers began to write on the topic of horse training, each expanding upon the work of their predecessors, including Federico Grisone (mid-16th century), Antoine de Pluvinel (1555–1620), William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle (1592–1676), François Robichon de La Guérinière (1688–1751), François Baucher (1796–1873), and Gustav Steinbrecht (1808–1885). The 20th century saw an increase in writing and teaching about Dressage training and techniques as the discipline became an international sport with the influence of Olympic Equestrian competition.

== Tack ==

The rules on permitted cavessons (nosebands) saddles, saddle pads, etc., are subject to change and do change as more and more styles and stylish equipments are introduced into the marketplace. Dressage horses are shown in minimal tack. They are not permitted to wear leg protection including boots or wraps during the test, nor are they allowed to wear martingales or training devices such as draw or running reins or the gogue anywhere on the showgrounds during the competition. Due to the formality of dressage, tack is usually black leather, although dark brown is seen from time to time.

An English-style saddle is required for riding dressage, specifically a &quot;dressage saddle&quot; which is modeled exclusively for the discipline. It is designed with a long and straight saddle flap, mirroring the leg of the dressage rider, which is long with a slight bend in the knee, a deep seat and usually a pronounced knee block. Dressage saddles have longer billets and use shorter girth than other types of English saddles to minimize the straps and buckles underneath the rider&#x27;s legs. The saddle is usually placed over a square, white saddle pad. Colored trim on the white saddle pad is permitted. A dressage saddle is required in FEI classes, although any simple English-type saddle may be used at the lower levels.

At the lower levels of dressage, a bridle includes a plain cavesson, drop noseband, or flash noseband. Currently, drop nosebands are relatively uncommon, with the flash more common. At the upper levels a plain cavesson is used on a double bridle. Figure-eight (also called Grackle) nosebands are not allowed in pure dressage, however they are allowed in the dressage phase of eventing. Riders are not allowed to use Kineton nosebands, due to their severity. Beads and colored trim are permitted along the brow band of the bridle.

The dressage horse at lower levels is only permitted to be shown at recognized competitions in a snaffle bit, though the detail regarding bitting varies slightly from organization to organization. The loose-ring snaffle with a single- or double-joint is most commonly seen. Harsher snaffle bits, such as twisted wire, corkscrews, slow-twists, and waterfords are not permitted, nor are pelhams, kimberwickes, or gag bits. Upper level and FEI dressage horses are shown in a double bridle, using both a bradoon and a curb bit with a smooth curb chain. Traditionally, the snaffle is used to open and lift the poll angle, while the curb is used to bring the nose of the horse towards the vertical.

== Turnout of the horse ==
Dressage horses are turned out to a high standard. It is usual for horses to have their manes braided (also known as plaited). In eventing, the mane is preferred to be braided on the right; in competitive dressage, however, it is occasionally braided on the left, should it naturally fall there. Braids vary in size, but Europeans tend to put in fewer, larger braids, while Americans tend to have more smaller braids per horse. Braids are occasionally accented in white tape, which also helps them stay in throughout the day. The forelock may be left unbraided; this style is most common with stallions. Braids are held in place by either yarn or rubber bands. It is a common misconception that a dressage horse must be braided, however this is not the case, and some riders may choose for various reasons not to braid.

Horses are not permitted to wear &quot;visual enhancements&quot; that might be considered distracting, or that might influence the judge&#x27;s perception of the horse. Bangles, ribbons, or other decorations are not allowed in the horse&#x27;s mane or tail. Competitors are not allowed to use black hoof polish on white hooves. Tail extensions are permitted in some countries, but not in FEI-sanctioned competitions.

The tail is usually not braided (although it is permitted), because it may cause the horse to carry the tail stiffly. Because the tail is an extension of the animal&#x27;s spine, a supple tail is desirable as it shows that the horse is supple through its back. The tail should be &quot;banged&quot;, or cut straight across (usually above the fetlocks but below the hocks when held at the point where the horse naturally carries it). The dock is pulled or trimmed to shape it and give the horse a cleaner appearance.

The bridle path is clipped or pulled, usually only 1–2 inches. The animal&#x27;s coat may be trimmed. American stables almost always trim the muzzle, face, ears, and legs, while European stables do not have such a strict tradition and may leave different parts untrimmed.

Clear hoof polish may be applied before the horse enters the arena. The horse is thoroughly clean. The horse&#x27;s saliva often forms &quot;foam&quot; about the horse&#x27;s lips, which is generally considered to be a sign of the horse&#x27;s submission and acceptance of the bit. Some riders believe that foam should not be cleaned off the horse&#x27;s mouth before entering the arena due to it being a sign of submission. Conversely, some riders choose to wipe the foam from their horses&#x27; mouths prior to entering the arena, as foam can land on the horses&#x27; chests and legs. The presence of foam does not necessarily indicate the horse&#x27;s acceptance of the bit, as certain metals such as German silver may cause the horse&#x27;s salivation to increase without full acceptance of the bit.

Quarter marks are sometimes seen, especially in the dressage phase of eventing. However, they are currently considered somewhat old-fashioned.

The turnout of a dressage horse is not taken into consideration in the marking of a test.

== Rider clothing ==

Dressage riders, like their horses, are dressed for formality. In competition, they wear white, cream or pale-coloured breeches, often full-seat leather to help them &quot;stick&quot; in the saddle, with a white shirt and stock tie with a small pin. Gloves are usually white, although less-experienced riders or those at the lower levels often opt for black, as white gloves tend to accentuate the movement of a less-experienced rider&#x27;s unsteady hands. The coat worn is usually solid black with metal buttons, although solid navy is also seen. In upper-level classes, the riders wear a tailed jacket (shadbelly) with a yellow vest or vest points instead of a plain dressage coat.

Riders usually wear tall dress boots, although field boots or paddock boots with half chaps may be worn by riders at the lower levels. Spurs are required at the upper levels, and riders must maintain a steady lower leg for proper use. A whip may be carried in any competition except in a CDI or a national championship, and the length is regulated. Whips are not permitted in eventing dressage when entering space around arena or during the test for FEI events. Whips (no longer than 120 cm) are permitted in eventing dressage at any time for USEA tests, except USEF/USEA Championships and USEA Championship divisions.

If the dressage rider has long hair, it is typically worn in a bun with a hair net or show bow. A hair net blends in with the rider&#x27;s hair color, whereas a show bow combines a barrette or hair tie with a small bow and thick hair net, and is usually black. Lower-level riders may use a derby, hunting cap, or ASTM/SEI-approved Equestrian helmet. In the United States, junior riders and riders through Fourth Level at recognized competitions are required to wear an ASTM/SEI approved helmet to protect against head trauma in the event of a fall. At the upper levels, a top hat that matches the rider&#x27;s coat is traditionally worn, though use of helmets is legal and increasing in popularity.

At FEI competitions, members of the military, police, national studs, national schools and national institutes retain the right to wear their service dress instead of the dress required of civilian riders.

== Para-dressage ==

Para-dressage is dressage for disabled people. It is a Paralympic sport since 1996.

== Cruelty to animals ==

The International Federation for Equestrian Sports (Fédération Equestre Internationale, FEI) Code of Conduct for the Welfare of the Horse states that &quot;Training methods: Horses... must not be subjected to methods which are abusive or cause fear.&quot;
 The FEI is sensitive to public perception of cruelty to animals. Their recently enacted Equine Ethics and Wellbeing Commission published recommendations and documents to promote ethical and evidence-based equestrianism. The FEI has banned hyperflexion of horse’s neck, the Rollkur technique, but a July 2014 article in the Guardian notes that it was still in use. 

Equestrian journalist and horse welfare activist Julie Taylor has argued for equestrian dressage to be dropped from the Olympics. The ban on star UK rider Charlotte Dujardin before the Paris Olympics in July 2024 raised the public awareness on the welfare of dressage horses.

<text>Eventing (also known as three-day eventing or horse trials) is an equestrian event where a single horse and rider combine and compete against other competitors across the three disciplines of dressage, cross-country, and show jumping. This event has its roots in a comprehensive cavalry test that required mastery of several types of riding. The competition may be run as a one-day event (ODE), where all three events are completed in one day (dressage, followed by show jumping and then the cross-country phase) or a three-day event (3DE), which is more commonly now run over four days, with dressage on the first two days, followed by cross-country the next day and then show jumping in reverse order on the final day. Eventing was previously known as Combined Training, and the name persists in many smaller organizations. The term &quot;Combined Training&quot; is sometimes confused with the term &quot;Combined Test&quot;, which refers to a combination of just two of the phases, most commonly dressage and show jumping.

==Phases==
Eventing is an equestrian triathlon, in that it combines three different disciplines in one competition set out over one, two, or three days, depending on the length of courses and number of entries.

This sport follows a similar format in Australia, Canada, Ireland, United Kingdom, and the United States. It is recognized internationally by the FEI.

===Dressage===

The dressage phase (held first) consists of an exact sequence of movements ridden in an enclosed arena (20×60 m for International 3DE but usually 20×40 m for ODE). The test is judged by one or more judges, who are looking for balance, rhythm, suppleness, and most importantly, the cooperation between the horse and rider. The challenge is to demonstrate that a supremely fit horse, capable of completing the cross-country phase on time, also has the training to perform in a graceful, relaxed, and precise manner. Dressage work is the basis of all the other phases and disciplines within the sport of eventing because it develops the strength and balance that allow a horse to go cross-country and show jump competently.

At the highest level of competition, the dressage test is roughly equivalent to the United States Dressage Federation Third Level and may ask for half-pass at trot, shoulder-in, travers, collected, medium and extended gaits, single flying changes, and counter-canter. The tests may &quot;not&quot; ask for Grand Prix movements such as piaffe, canter pirouette, or passage.

Each movement in the test is scored on a scale from 0 to 10, with a score of &quot;10&quot; being the highest possible mark and with the total maximum score for the test varying depending on the level of competition and the number of movements. A score of 10 is very rare. Therefore, if one movement is poorly executed, it is still possible for the rider to get a good overall score if the remaining movements are very well executed. The marks are added together and any errors of course deducted. To convert this score to penalty points, the average marks of all judges are converted to a percentage of the maximum possible score, subtracted from 100 and the multiplied by a co-efficient decided by the governing body. 
* Once the bell rings the rider is allowed 45 seconds to enter the ring or receive a two-point penalty, then an additional 45 seconds, for a total of 90 seconds, or is eliminated.
* If all four feet of the horse exit the arena during the test, this results in elimination.
* If the horse resists more than 20 seconds during the test, this results in elimination.
* If the rider falls, this results in elimination. 
* Errors on course:
** 1st: minus 2 marks
** 2nd: minus 4 marks
** 3rd: elimination

===Cross-country===
The next phase, cross-country, requires both horse and rider to be in excellent physical shape and to be brave and trusting of each other. This phase consists of approximately 12–20 fences (lower levels), or 30–40 at the higher levels, placed on a long outdoor circuit. These fences consist of very solidly built natural objects (logs, stone walls, etc.) as well as various obstacles such as ponds and streams, ditches, drops and banks, and combinations including several jumping efforts based on objects that would commonly occur in the countryside. Sometimes, particularly at higher levels, fences are designed that would not normally occur in nature. However, these are still designed to be as solid as more natural obstacles. Safety regulations mean that some obstacles are now being built with a &quot;frangible pin system&quot;, allowing part or all of the jump to collapse if hit with enough impact. Speed is also a factor, with the rider required to cross the finish line within a certain time frame (optimum time). Crossing the finish line after the optimum time results in penalties for each second over. Riders are usually allowed to wear a stopwatch to enable them to monitor their progress against the optimum time. At lower levels, there is also a speed fault time, where penalties are incurred for horse and rider pairs completing the course too quickly (riders who are judged to be deliberately slowing down e.g. trotting between fences to avoid penalties for going too fast can be eliminated). For every &quot;disobedience&quot; (refusal or run-out of a jump) a horse and rider incur on course, penalties will be added to their dressage score. After four disobediences altogether or three disobediences at one fence the pair is eliminated, meaning they can no longer participate in the competition. A horse and rider pair can also be eliminated for going off course, for example missing a fence. If the horses shoulder and hind-quarter touch the ground, mandatory retirement is taken and they are not allowed to participate further in the competition. If the rider falls off the horse they are eliminated. However, in the US this rule is currently being revised for the Novice level and below. The penalties for disobediences on cross-country are weighted severely relative to the other phases of competition to emphasize the importance of courage, endurance, and athleticism. Fitness is required as the time allowed will require a strong canter at the lower levels, all the way to a strong gallop at the higher events.

In recent years, a controversy has developed between supporters of short and long format three-day events. Traditionally, three-day events had dressage, endurance, and show jumping. Endurance day consisted of 4 phases: A, B, C and D. Phases A and C were roads and tracks, with A being a medium-paced warm up to prepare the horse and rider for Phase B, a steeplechase format at an extremely fast pace over steeplechase-style fences. Phase C was a slow-paced cool down coming off of phase B, in preparation for the toughest and most demanding phase, D, or cross-country. Before embarking on phase D, in the &quot;ten-minute box&quot;, horses had to be approved to continue by a vet, who monitored their temperature and heart rate, ensuring that the horse was sound and fit.

Three day events are now offered in the classic format, with endurance day, or short-format, with no steeplechase (phase B) or roads and tracks (phases A and C). The 2004 Olympic Summer Games in Athens, Greece chose the short format, due to lack of facilities, time and financing, which sparked a large debate in the eventing community whether to keep the steeplechase phase or just offer cross-country. Today, most events are run short-format. In the United States the &quot;classic format&quot; remains a popular option for the Novice, and Training levels of competition at select events.

In 2008, the rules regarding safety in the sport were changed. One change stated that a fall anywhere during the cross-country phase resulted in elimination, even if the rider was galloping on course and not approaching a jump, or in the middle of a combination.

==== Scoring ====

* Refusal, run-out, or circle:
** At the same obstacle:
*** First: 20 penalties
*** Second: 40 penalties
*** 20 penalties at each question
** In the round (for instance one refusal at each of several different obstacles):
*** Third (used to be fourth refusal, and still is for lower national levels in some countries only): elimination
*Activating a frangible device on cross country at an FEI competition will now award 11 penalties under the ground jury&#x27;s discretion
* Fall of rider: elimination 
* Fall of horse (shoulder and hind touch the ground): elimination 
* Exceeding the time:
** Optimum: 0.4 penalties per second
** Limit (twice the optimum): elimination 
* Coming in under speed fault time: 1 penalty per second (lower national levels in some countries only)

==== Other faults ====
* Competing with improper saddlery: elimination 
* Jumping without headgear or a properly fastened harness: elimination 
* Error of course not rectified: elimination 
* Omission of obstacle: elimination 
* Jumping an obstacle in the wrong order or direction: elimination 
* Retaking an obstacle already jumped: elimination 
* Dangerous riding, at determination of the ground jury: elimination (usually with a warning first) 
* Failure to wear medical armband: elimination (at discretion of ground jury) 
* 3 or 4 (depending on the competition) refusals on whole course: elimination

==== Types of obstacles ====

A combination is always considered one obstacle, and the various elements within the combination are lettered &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and so on. In cross-country, the rider need only retake the element they refused rather than the whole complex. So a refusal at element B does not require them to jump A again. However, they have the option of retaking the previous elements if they wish. For example, in a bounce type obstacle it may be physically impossible to approach B without first clearing A. Yet for some in and outs, you can go to B and not have to rejump A.

Many cross-country obstacles have several possible routes to take (for example, at obstacle 5 there may be 2 A, 2 B, and 2 C elements), with one route usually being faster but requiring a more skillful ride or more physical effort from the horse. A rider may take any of the possible routes as long as they pass over each letter once. Additionally, after a refusal, they may jump a different obstacle of the same letter in place of the original.

A refusal at A is a first refusal, and would receive 20 penalties. Whether the rider retakes A or not, a subsequent refusal at B is a second refusal and so on. Three refusals at any one obstacle results in elimination, as does 4 refusals on the entire course.

====Ten Minute Box====

The &quot;Ten Minute Box&quot; is a compulsory halt included during the cross-country section of a three-day event after the roads and tracks and steeplechase phases and before the &quot;pure&quot; cross-country jumping phase. It is a pause designed to allow the horse time to cool off, rest and stabilize its vitals and ensure that it is prepared for the &quot;pure&quot; cross-country phase. In the Ten Minute Box, riders and assistants will cool the horse down, walk the horse around and check tack and studs and a veterinarian will inspect the horse - including checking its heart and respiration rates - to determine if it is fit to compete in the final &quot;pure&quot; cross-country phase.

=== Show jumping ===

Stadium or show jumping is the final phase of eventing competition and tests the technical jumping skills of the horse and rider, including suppleness, obedience, fitness, and athleticism. In this phase, 12–20 fences are set up in a ring. These fences are typically brightly colored and consist of elements that can be knocked down, unlike cross-country obstacles. This phase is also timed, with penalties being given for every second over the required time. In addition to normal jumping skills, eventing show jumping tests the fitness and stamina of the horse and rider, generally being held after the cross-country phase in higher level and international events.

==== Scoring ====
* Knocking down an obstacle: 4 penalties
* Disobedience (refusal, run-out, circle, moving backwards) over the whole round:
** First: 4 penalties
** Second: Elimination
* Fall of rider: Elimination
* Fall of horse: Elimination
* Exceeding the time allowed: 0.4 of a penalty per second
* Jumping an obstacle in the wrong order: Elimination
* Error of course not rectified: Elimination

An obstacle is defined as having been knocked down if any part of its height is lowered. It is therefore possible to knock out a pole below the top pole and receive no penalties, as long as the highest pole stays in place, so that the jump retains the same height. It does count as a knockdown if the highest pole falls out of one jump cup but remains in the other; although part of the pole remains at the original height, the other part is lowered.

The winner is the horse and rider with the fewest penalties. Awards are usually presented while mounted, before the placed riders take a lap of honor around the arena.

==History==
===Olympic beginning===

Eventing competition that resembles the current three-day were first held in 1902, at the Championnat du Cheval d&#x27;Armes in France, and was introduced into the Olympic Games starting 1912 in Stockholm, Sweden. Dressage originally demonstrated the horse&#x27;s ability to perform on the parade ground, where elegance and obedience were key. Cross-country began as a test of stamina, courage, and bravery over difficult terrain, important for a on long marches or if the horse was asked to carry a dispatch across country. The show jumping phase sought to prove the horse&#x27;s continuing soundness and fitness after the difficult cross-country day.

The Olympic eventing competition was originally open only to male military officers in active duty, mounted only on military charges. In 1924, the event was open to male civilians, although non-commissioned Army officers could not participate in the Olympics until 1956. Women were first allowed to take part in 1964; equestrian sports are one of the few Olympic sports in which men and women compete against one another.

===Format===
The original format, used in the 1912 Olympics, was spread over several days:
*Day 1: Endurance test comprising (with a time allowed of 4 hours, giving a speed of approx. 230 meters per minute) immediately followed by of a flagged cross-country course at a speed of 333 meters per minute. Time penalties were given for exceeding the time allowed, but no bonus points were given for being fast.
*Day 2: Rest day
*Day 3: Steeplechase test of with 10 plain obstacles, at a speed of 600 mpm, with time penalties but no time bonus points
*Day 4: Jumping test (&quot;prize jumping&quot;), which was considered easy by most of the spectators
*Day 5: Dressage test (&quot;prize riding&quot;)

The Paris Games in 1924 introduced a format very similar to the one of today: with day 1 dressage, day 2 the endurance test, and day 3 the jumping test. The endurance test has changed the most since that time. Originally, bonus points could be earned for a fast ride cross-country (less than the optimum time). This helped competitors make up for a poor dressage ride, with a clean, fast cross-country ride. This system, however, was dropped in 1971. The format for the endurance test occurred as below:

*Phase A: Short roads and tracks (with five penalties per 5 seconds over time)
*Phase B: Steeplechase, decreased in speed from 600 mpm to 550 mpm (with 10 penalties added per 5 seconds over the time, 3 bonus points per 5 seconds under time)
*Phase C: Long roads and tracks (with 5 penalties per 5 seconds over time)
*Compulsory Halt (now the 10-minute halt)
*Phase D: Cross-country (with 10 penalties added per 5 seconds over the time, 3 bonus points per 10 seconds under time)
*Phase E: 1.25 mile run on the flat (with 5 penalties per 5 seconds over time).

(Note: Phase E was abolished in 1967.)

In 1963, the 10-minute halt was introduced, to occur after the completion of phases A, B, and C. It took place in a marked out area (the 10-minute box), where the horse was checked by two judges and one veterinary official who would make sure the horse was fit to continue onto phase D. If the horse was unfit, the panel would pull it from the competition.

The format of the sport underwent major changes in 2004 and 2005, with the creation of the &quot;short&quot; or &quot;modified format&quot;, which excluded phases A, B, and C from endurance day. The primary reason for excluding these phases was that the Olympic Committee was considering dropping the sport of eventing from the Olympics because of the cost and large area required for the speed and endurance phase with a steeplechase course and several miles of roads-and-tracks. To prevent the elimination of the sport from the Olympics program, the &quot;short format&quot; was developed by the FEI. The last Olympic Games that included the long, or &quot;classic&quot;, three-day format was the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, while Rolex Kentucky, the Badminton Horse Trials, and Burghley Horse Trials ran their last long format three-day in 2005. The short format is now the standard for international competition, such as the Olympics and World Equestrian Games.

The change in format has brought about controversy. Some riders support the continuation of the classic format, believing it is the &quot;true test of horse and rider&quot;. Others believe the classic format is superior because it teaches horsemanship, due to the extra preparation needed to condition the horse and the care required after the several miles of endurance day. However, others prefer the short format, as they believe it saves wear-and-tear on their horses and allows the horse not only to compete in more three-day events each season, but decreases the chance of injury to the horse. However, this claim has not held true in several recent studies that compared injuries sustained in classic and in short format competitions over equivalent courses. Further, some research indicates that horses are more stressed by the short format than by the careful warm-up inherent in the classic format. Regardless, many upper-level riders prepare their horses for the short format using the same conditioning and training as for the long format. The short format has also been widely urged by breeders of heavier, warmblood-type horses. The long format has remained popular at the Novice and Training levels in the United States, and with riders who feel it maximizes horsemanship.

===Veterinary inspection, or &quot;trot up&quot;/&quot;horse inspection&quot;===
Before the beginning of a three-day event, and also before the last phase, horses are inspected by a vet to ensure that they are fit to compete further. It is usually a formal affair, with well-groomed and braided horses, and nicely dressed riders. It is also a very nerve-wracking time, as the &quot;pass&quot; or &quot;fail&quot; determines whether the horse may continue with the competition. A vet can request that a horse be sent to the holding box, where it will then be re-assessed before being allowed to continue. In upper level FEI classes, a second veterinarian (often called the Associate FEI Veterinarian) may inspect horses sent to the hold box and make the decision to pass or fail a horse. This practice is in place so that no one veterinarian has complete power to eliminate a horse and allows for a large number of horses to be evaluated in a timely manner.

In lower levels of competition, the horse&#x27;s movement may be analyzed as they finish the cross-country, where they will be asked to trot briefly after crossing the finishing line to satisfy the vet of their soundness.

===Penalty point system===
In 1971, the penalty point system was first introduced into eventing. This system converts the dressage score and all jump penalties on cross-country and show jumping into penalty points, with the horse and rider with the fewest points winning the event. Different weight is given for each phase, with the cross-country — the heart of eventing — being the most important, followed by the dressage and then the show jumping. The intended ratio of cross-country:dressage:show jumping is theoretically 12:3:1. Therefore, an error in cross-country counts heavily. This prevents horses that are simply good in dressage (for example) from winning the event with a poor cross-country test.

In 1971, the following penalty system was instituted:
*Phase A and C: 1 penalty per second over the optimum time
*Phase B: 0.8 penalties per second over
*Phase D: 0.4 penalties per second over

In 1977, the dressage scoring was changed, with each movement marked out of ten rather than out of six. This increased the maximum number of dressage marks from 144 to 240. This number later increased to 250 marks in 1998, after additional movements were added. To keep the correct weight, a formula is used to convert good marks in dressage to penalty points. First, the marks of the judges (if there is more than one) are averaged. Then the raw mark is subtracted from the maximum points possible. This number is then multiplied by 0.6 to calculate the final penalty score.

Show jumping rules were also changed in 1977, with a knock-down or a foot in the water awarded only 5 penalties rather than 10. This prevented the show jumping phase from carrying too much weight, again, to keep the ratio between the phases correct.

====Current scoring====
The dressage score is converted to a percentage and the penalty points calculated by subtracting the percentage from 100. This is rounded to 1 decimal digit.

In cross country, penalty points are awarded for jumping errors and for time. In the jumping, 20 penalty points are awarded for a first refusal at an obstacle and 40 penalty points for a second refusal (the rider is eliminated on their third refusal). Two refusals at different obstacles each attract 20 penalty points. If a horse jumps an obstacle, but the body of the horse does not pass completely between the flags, 15 penalty points are awarded, only if the horse would have cleared the obstacle&#x27;s height had it been better positioned. If a horse activates an obstacle&#x27;s frangible device, 11 penalty points are awarded.

Time penalties are awarded for being too slow over the optimum time at a rate of 0.4 penalty points per second over this time up to the time limit (twice the optimum time) at which point the competitor is eliminated. Some national bodies implement a fastest time allowed for lower grades where more inexperienced riders compete. The fastest time allowed can range from 20 seconds to 45 seconds faster than the optimum time. Typically, penalty points are awarded at a rate of 1 per second faster than this time.

In the show jumping test, either knocking down of the obstacle or refusing to jump the obstacle attracts 4 penalty points. In the case of a knock, riders are permitted to continue to the next obstacle. However, if the obstacle was refused, it must be reattempted. A second refusal at the same obstacle results in elimination. Similarly to the cross country, time penalty points are awarded at a rate of 0.4 penalty points per second commenced over the optimum time.

===Non-Olympic competition===
In its early days, the sport was most popular in Britain, and the British gave the competition a new name, the &quot;Three-Day Event&quot;, due to the three-day time span of the competition. In America, the sport was also called &quot;combined training&quot;, due to the three different disciplines and types of training methods needed for the horse. In the United Kingdom, &quot;combined training&quot; competition includes only the dressage and show jumping phases.

In between a &#x27;combined training&#x27; and a &#x27;horse trial&#x27;, there are also &#x27;short courses&#x27;. Short courses consist of a dressage phase and a jumping phase. The jumping phase usually starts in the stadium ring with a fence leading out to a smaller field with some cross-country fences (not as many as in a horse trial&#x27;s cross-country phase). The rider will then jump back into the stadium ring to finish his or her course.

The first annual, Olympic-level event developed was the Badminton Horse Trials, held each year in England. First held in 1949, the Badminton event was created after a poor performance by the British Eventing Team at the 1948 Olympic Games, with the purpose of being a high-class preparation event, and as extra exposure for the military horses, who very rarely had the chance to compete. Initially, only British riders were allowed to compete (although women were allowed, despite being banned from riding in the Olympics), but the competition is now an international open to all riders from around the world who have qualified for this level of competition. Along with Burghley and Kentucky, Badminton is one of the most prestigious events to win in the world. Currently, the Olympic event is considered a CCI****, a rank lower than Badminton which is a CCI*****.

The second three-day competition to be held at Olympic level each year was the Burghley Horse Trials, first held in 1961. Burghley is the longest running international event.

The first CCI held outside of Britain on an annual basis is the Rolex Kentucky Three Day, held each year in Lexington since 1978.

===Importance of dressage training===
In the early years, the dressage phase was fairly inconsequential in determining the final standings. It was quite possible for a horse to have a terrible dressage test, then run a clean cross-country and show jumping, and still finish near the top of the standings. Since then, correct dressage training has become increasingly important should a horse and rider wish to be placed (complete all sections and finish in the top 12). This can be traced back to Sheila Willcox, who took a particular interest in dressage, becoming abundantly clear when she won Badminton three years running in the 1950s. She had a strong influence on Mary King and Lucinda Green amongst others.

After the 2000 Olympic Games, the FEI hired British eventer and dressage rider Christopher Bartle to write new dressage tests for the upper-level events, which would include a greater deal of collection. This has since raised the standard even further in the dressage phase.

Additionally, the cross-country phase has become more technical, asking the horse to be adjustable and supple through combinations. A horse can no longer just be brave and athletic but must have a good deal of dressage training should his rider wish to successfully negotiate odd distances or bending lines at a gallop. Also, in show jumping, a horse is asked to move with impulsion and engagement; this makes the jump more fluent, brings the horse to bascule more correctly, and is less jarring for both horse and rider.

===Safety===
Between 1997 and December 2008, at least 37 eventing riders died as a result of injuries incurred while competing in the cross-country phase of eventing at national or international level or at Pony Club. Of these, 18 riders died in the period 2006–2008. These 37 fatal falls have been at all levels of the sport, from domestic one-day events up to regional championships level, and they have occurred in most of the recognized eventing countries around the world, with concentrations in the United Kingdom (14) and the United States (8). At least 25 of these 37 deaths have resulted from a somersaulting (rotational) fall of the horse, with 11 of the 16 deaths in 2007 and 2008 being reported as having resulted from rotational falls.  The FEI reports that horse falls happen at a rate of 1 per every 63 starters on cross country, with rotating falls happening once in every 572 starters.

Information about horse fatalities is difficult to locate, but at least 19 eventing horses, many of them top-level performers, died in 2007 and 2008. 

Over time, course design has become increasingly more focused on the safety of the horse and rider. The layout of the course and the build of the obstacles encourage the horse to have a successful run. This includes greater use of precision fences, such as corners and &quot;skinny jumps&quot;, that are very good tests of the rider&#x27;s ability and the horse&#x27;s training but allow the horse to simply run around the jump if the rider misjudges it. Safety measures such as filling in the area between corner-shaped jumps on cross-country or rails of a fence help prevent the entrapment of the legs of the horse decrease the number of serious falls or injuries.

The newest improvement in cross-country safety is the &quot;frangible&quot; fence, which uses a pin and other techniques which allow the fence to &quot;break or fall&quot; in a controlled manner to minimize the risk of injury to horse and rider. This can help to prevent the most dangerous situation on cross-country, when the horse hits a solid fence between the forearm and chest, and somersaults over (rotational fall), sometimes falling on the rider. This type of fall has caused the deaths of several riders and horses.

Rules protecting riders have improved as well. Riders are now required to wear a safety vest (body protector) during cross-country, as well as an ASTM/SEI or ISO approved equestrian helmet equipped with a retention harness, which must be fastened while on the horse. Eventing was one of the first sports to require the use of a helmet with harness when jumping. As of 2010, more riders were wearing air bag vests, which automatically inflate if a rider falls off the horse.

===Weight rule===
From the beginning, event horses had to carry a minimum weight of (including rider and saddle) during the endurance test, since military horses were expected to be able to carry such weight. Lead weights were carried on the saddle, and the competitor had to be weighed-in with tack immediately following cross-country. The weight was reduced to for the 1996 Olympic Games, after a study demonstrated that both the horse&#x27;s arc over a fence became shallower and the leading leg took a great deal of extra force on landing when the horse was carrying dead weight than when free from the burden. The rule was eventually abolished January 1, 1998. By removing this rule, the stress on the joints and soft-tissue, as well as the chance of a fall, were decreased.

==International competition==
International events have specific categories and levels of competition and are conducted under the rules of the FEI. CCI (Concours Complet International, or International Complete Contest) is one such category and defines a three-day event that is open to competitors from any foreign nation as well as the host nation.

*CCI : International Three-day event (Concours Complet International)
*CIC: International One-day event (Concours International Combiné)
*CCIO: International Team Competitions (Concours Complet International Officiel). Includes the Olympics, the World Championships, the Pan Am Games, and other continental championships

The levels of international events are identified by the number of stars next to the category; there are four levels in total. A CCI* is for horses that are just being introduced to international competition. A CCI** is geared for horses that have some experience of international competition. CCI*** is the advanced level of competition.

The very highest level of competition is the CCI****, and with only seven such competitions in the world (Badminton, Burghley, Kentucky, Adelaide, Luhmuhlen Horse Trials, Maryland 5 Star at Fair Hill and the Stars of Pau). The World Championships are also considered CCI****. Rolex offers a financial prize for any rider who can win three of the biggest competitions in succession. These are Badminton, Burghley and Kentucky. So far, Pippa Funnell (Great Britain) and Michael Jung (Germany) are the only riders to do this. Andrew Hoy did come close, however, and in 2010 Oliver Townend was competing for this coveted &quot;Grand Slam&quot; at Rolex Kentucky when he suffered a fall at obstacle #20 which eliminated him from competition.

One, two and three-star competitions are roughly comparable to the Novice, Intermediate and Advanced levels of British domestic competition, respectively, and to the Preliminary, Intermediate, and Advanced levels of American domestic competition, respectively.

Following the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio, the IOC approached the FEI insisting on modifications to the existing format yet again for eventing to maintain its status as an Olympic discipline. &quot;There was a lot of pressure from the Olympic Committee to make it more spectator friendly, to make it cheaper, and we definitely had to have more [countries represented],&quot; said Marilyn Payne, a member of the FEI Eventing Committee.

At the 2016 FEI General Assembly, the FEI voted in favor of several proposed format changes for the Olympic Games that would make it both easier for more countries to participate and easier for spectators to understand. Those changes include limiting nations to teams of three with no drop score and changing the level of competition to (current) four-star dressage and show jumping with a 10-minute, 45-effort cross-country course at the (current) three-star level of difficulty.

Hence, with Olympic cross-country now designated at the (current) three-star level of difficulty, more riders from more nations will have the opportunity to qualify. Payne added, &quot;By having five stars, the one-star will now be below what the one-star was and very close to our Modified level. That&#x27;s intended to create a pipeline to let developing countries in eventing hold competitions and get riders competent at that level so they can naturally progress to the higher levels. Plus, the more countries who participate, the more spectators who will watch.&quot;

&quot;Ultimately it&#x27;s all about risk management and trying to make the sport safer,&quot; Payne concluded.

While the 2017 FEI General Assembly proposed the rule change that would implement the new five-star system, there were still plenty of details to iron out. The FEI elected to not put the new star system into place until 2019, giving them 2018 to refine the language of the new system. However, the new international Introductory level, which will become the new CCI* level and is roughly equivalent to the Modified level, was introduced in 2018.

==National competition==
Eventing rules and the recognized levels in various nations are similar, but not always identical. While rules usually follow the FEI to some degree, history and tradition of various nations has also influenced competition rules within a given country.

In addition to recognized events that prepare the best riders for international competition, many nations also offer eventing for beginner, youth, and amateur riders through organizations such as Pony Club, 4-H or other riding clubs, where most riders begin their competitive careers. At the most elementary levels, fence heights begin at around 18 inches to .

===Australia===

===United Kingdom===
British Eventing (BE) levels of eventing are as follows:
* BE80(T) : max. fence height 0.80m
* BE90 (formerly Introductory): max. fence height 0.90 m XC, 0.95 m SJ
* BE100 (formerly Pre-Novice): max. fence height 1.00 m XC, 1.05 m SJ
* BE100 Plus: max. fence height 1.00 m XC, 1.15 m SJ

* Advanced Intermediate: max. fence height 1.15 m XC; 1.30 SJ
* Advanced: max. fence height 1.20 m XC; 1.30 m SJ

===United States===
In the United States, eventing is broken down into the following levels, all of which are recognized by the United States Eventing Association (USEA) and are run in accordance with the rules of US Equestrian (USEF) the governing body for equestrian sports in the United States:

* Beginner Novice: X-C fences: , 14–18 efforts XC, ditch , drops , 300–350 m/min (meters per minute) on cross-country; Stadium fences: , 9–11 efforts.
* Novice: X-C fences , 16–20 efforts, ditch , drops , 350 to 400 m/min; Stadium fences , 9–11 efforts.
* Training: X-C fences , 20–24 efforts, ditch , drops , 420 to 470 m/min; Stadium fences , 10–12 efforts.
* Modified: X-C fences 3 ft 5 in (1.04 m), 22-28 efforts, ditch 8 ft 6 in (2.59 m), drops 4 ft 11 in (1.50 m), 490 m/min; Stadium fences 3 ft 5 in (1.04 m), 10-13 efforts.
* Preliminary: X-C fences , 22–30 efforts, ditch , drops , 520 m/min; Stadium fences , 11–13 efforts.
* Intermediate: X-C fences , 26–34 efforts, ditch , drops , 550 m/min; Stadium fences , 12–14 efforts.
* Advanced: X-C fences , 32–40 efforts, ditch , drops , 570 m/min; Stadium fences , 13–15 efforts.

It is also common to see inter-levels (such as the Intermediate/Preliminary, or IP), which help riders transition between levels by using the dressage and show jumping tests of the higher level and the cross-country course of the lower, and starter levels, which use the dressage test and stadium course standards of the lower CT levels (e.g., Amoeba, Tadpole, Green as Grass) with a very simple cross-country course. However, the starter levels are considered &quot;test&quot; levels and thus do not have a consistent standard (or a national points system and leaderboard).

There are also unrecognized shows held in the United States. The following are the two unrecognized levels:

-Elementary: X-C fences 2 ft 3 inches (0.61 m), 12-14 efforts, no ditches, no drops, not timed, Stadium fences 2 ft 3 inches, 8 efforts

- Intro: X-C fences 18inches- 2 ft, 8-12 efforts, no ditches, not timed, Stadium fences 18inches- 2 ft, 7-9 efforts https://useventing.com/news-media/podcasts/unrecognized-events-an-eventing-pipeline

==Horse==
Thoroughbreds and part-Thoroughbreds currently dominate the sport at the top levels because of their stamina and athletic ability. In addition, many warmbloods and warmblood-thoroughbred crosses also do well. In the UK, Irish sport horses have been popular for many years.

Because larger horses are favored, animals with some draft horse breeding are also seen, notably the Irish Draught and Clydesdale crossbreds. However, smaller horses can also excel; for example, the third place competitor in the 2007 Rolex Kentucky Three Day CCI competition was Theodore O&#x27;Connor, a gelding that was a cross of Thoroughbred, Arabian and Shetland pony breeding.

An event horse must be very responsive to succeed, as a horse that will not listen to a rider on the cross-country phase may end up taking a fall at a jump. The horse should be calm and submissive for the dressage phase, with good training on the flat. For cross-country, the horse must be brave, athletic, and (especially at the higher levels) fast with a good galloping stride and great stamina. The horse does not have to possess perfect jumping form, but should be safe over fences and have good scope. Scope is a broad term used to describe a horse&#x27;s potential to jump big jumps. The best event horses are careful over jumps, as those who are not tend to have stadium rails knocked down on the last day. The horse also needs to have sound conformation and good feet.

==Riding attire==
Riding attire is different in each of the three phases. Dressage and show jumping feature the traditional turnout for each of those disciplines, requiring conservative attire. However, as of 2017 lower level divisions in the United States allow for more flexibility in the rider&#x27;s attire. Cross-country attire and equipment emphasizes and requires safety protocols be followed, but has less formal appearance, with many riders wearing clothing of personalized, often bright colors. Under FEI rules, civilian riders may opt to wear the uniform of their riding club, and members of the military and national studs are required to wear service dress in the dressage and show jumping phases.

===Dressage===
For the intermediate and advanced levels, riders usually wear dressage attire similar to that of Grand Prix Dressage, including a top hat and white riding breeches. However, even at the most senior levels (e.g., the World Equestrian Games, the Olympics, and CCI****) FEI dress requirements are less strict, requiring only &quot;hunting dress&quot;; a white shirt and a tie of any kind; gloves of any colour; white, fawn, or cream breeches; and riding boots of any colour. The wearing of shadbelly or other tailcoat jackets is not compulsory in the dressage phase.

Rules at non-FEI competition vary. In the US, formal attire is not required if all phases run in one day or for the lower levels. Though navy and black coats are the preferred traditional style, riders may wear any conservatively colored dark or tweed hunting coat with a white shirt and choker or, preferably, a stock tie with pin. If a rider wishes to stay within traditional requirements for higher-level competition, breeches should be white, fawn, or cream. A black or navy hunt cap or derby hat may be worn, although many riders use an equestrian helmet, which are considered safer. Some organizations, such as the British Horse Society and USEF consider helmets to be compulsory.
Boots may be field or dress style, black or brown in color. Gloves and spurs give a polished appearance but are not required at lower levels. Dressage gloves are traditionally white, although other colors are permitted. Spurs, when worn, are restricted to certain lengths and types. 

===Cross-country===
 The rider is required to wear a body protector vest, an approved equestrian helmet which must be properly fastened at all times when jumping, and a medical armband, containing the rider&#x27;s medical history, allowing access to the information should the rider fall, be knocked unconscious, and require medical treatment.

FEI rules allow riders to dress as they please in the cross-country phase. Light-weight rugby or polo shirts are the most commonly worn shirt style, usually without a stock or tie. Riding coats are generally not worn. Many riders wear a stop-watch to track their time so that they may adjust their speed to come in as close as possible to the optimum time.

=== Show jumping ===
Eventing riders tend to follow the dress practices of showjumpers in the show jumping phase. However, FEI rules only require &quot;hunting dress&quot;; white shirt and tie of any kind; white, fawn, or cream breeches; and boots of any kind.
In most nations&#x27; nationally sanctioned competitions, and often even at lower levels, a protective equestrian helmet with harness is required, and a short hunt coat is traditional, except when weather is unreasonably warm, when, at the discretion of the technical delegate, jackets may be considered optional. If helmet covers are used, they are required to be black or dark blue though some now include national colors where they are entitled to be worn.

==Turnout of the horse and tack==

===Turnout and grooming===
Event horses are turned out similarly to dressage horses, with the legs and face (muzzle, jaw, sides of ears, bridle path) neatly clipped. The tail is usually &quot;banged&quot; (cut straight across), usually to a length between the fetlock joint and lower hock. Additionally, most event riders clip the sides of their mount&#x27;s tails, to give them a finer appearance. Braiding of tails is fairly uncommon, probably because the tail can not be braided if the hairs along the sides of the dock are clipped.

The mane is pulled to about in length and is usually braided for dressage as well as the show jumping phase. However, most riders prefer to leave it loose for cross-country in case they need to grab it for security. Some riders also place quarter marks (decorative stenciling) on the hindquarters.

===Tack===

Most event riders have a jumping saddle as well as a dressage saddle since each places them in a position better-suited for its purpose. At the lower levels, however, a rider can ride all three phases without difficulty in a well-fitted jumping saddle. At the upper levels, riders usually have a saddle specifically designed for cross-country, giving them more freedom for such fences as banks and drops.

Dressage tack is usually black in color, with a white square pad, giving a formal look. Except for the upper levels, where a double bridle is permitted, horses may only be ridden in snaffle bits. There are strict guidelines as to what type of snaffle may be used, and the more severe types (such as any twisted bit) are prohibited. If a double bridle is used, a plain cavesson or crank noseband must be worn. With a snaffle bridle, the rider is also free to use the drop, flash, or grackle noseband, with the flash and plain cavesson being the most common. Breastplates are also fairly common in dressage at an event, despite the fact that they are not seen at regular dressage shows. Other forms of equipment, such as martingales, protective boots, gadgets/training devices, bit guards, exercise bandages, or tail wraps, are not allowed during the test.
In show jumping, the rider uses a jumping saddle, usually with a square or fitted white pad. Rules on tack are less-stringent, and most forms of bridling and bitting are allowed, including the use of gag bits, hackamores, and any type of noseband. Breastplates and open front boots are usually worn. Running martingales are also allowed, but must be used with rein stops. Standing and Irish martingales are not allowed.

For the cross-country phase, the rider usually uses similar tack as for the show jumping. However, cross-country boots are used for extra protection, to help prevent injury if they were to hit the solid obstacles. Most horses that wear shoes are also fitted with horse shoe studs, to prevent slipping. At the upper levels, riders may also apply a grease or lard to the front of the horse&#x27;s legs, to help the horse slide over fences if they hang a leg. Riders also tend to color-coordinate their cross-country tack to their colors. For example, using the same color saddle pad and tape for their boots, to match their shirt and protective vest.

<text>The American Correctional Association (ACA; called the National Prison Association before 1954) is a private, non-profit, non-governmental trade association and accrediting body for the corrections industry, the oldest and largest such association in the world. The organization was founded in 1870 and has a significant place in the history of prison reform in the U.S.

ACA accredits over 900 prisons, jails, community residential centers (halfway houses), and various other corrections facilities in the U.S. and internationally, using their independently published standards manuals. Approximately 80 percent of all U.S. state departments of corrections and youth services are active participants. Also included are programs and facilities operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the private sector. 

Shane Bauer of &quot;Mother Jones&quot; wrote that the ACA functions as &quot;the closest thing [the United States has] to a national regulatory body for prisons&quot; in addition to being the American correctional industry&#x27;s trade association. According to their website, the ACA has more than 5,000 members.

== History ==
The ACA was founded under the name National Prison Association. The driving creative force was Enoch Cobb Wines, a minister and reformer who organized an 1870 congress in Cleveland, hoping to introduce the principles of the progressive New York Prison Association to a national stage. Former U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes served as the organization&#x27;s first president in 1883. Hayes &quot;missed no opportunity to speak with well-informed sincerity about more effective and more humane ways of dealing with offenders&quot;. He remained president until his death ten years later.

Roeliff Brinkerhoff, an Ohio publisher, political figure, and frequent Hayes ally, succeeded Hayes as the association president. For the next twenty years, Brinkerhoff used the NPA as a platform to pursue basic correctional reforms such as the separation of state and federal prison systems, and the idea of parole, then a relatively new concept. With Brinkerhoff&#x27;s influence, the state of Ohio passed a state parole law in 1885, the nation&#x27;s first.

The organization&#x27;s name was officially changed in 1954 to more accurately reflect the organization&#x27;s philosophy and scope.

ACA began exploring the feasibility of accrediting its members in the 1960s, funded in part by a sizable 1969 grant from the Ford Foundation. In May 1974, the ACA created its &quot;Commission on Accreditation for Corrections&quot; in a meeting chaired by Walter Dunbar, a New York corrections figure known for his spokesman role at the Attica Prison riot. (The ACA maintains an annual achievement award in his honor.) In 1979, the Vienna Correctional Center, operated by the Illinois Department of Corrections, became the first accredited adult correctional institution.

In 2011, ACA began to branch out, and it audited the first detention facilities outside of the U.S. or Canada. In January 2012 four Mexican facilities became accredited by ACA, using their Core International Standards manual.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, ACA received a $99,540 grant from Pfizer to promote uptake of their COVID-19 vaccine.

=== Conferences ===
ACA hosts bi-annual conferences in different cities around the U.S. The first conference is the &quot;ACA Winter Conference&quot; with the year included in the title before ACA. It holds its second annual conference, the Congress of Correction, during the summer. Notable speakers at ACA conferences have included General Richard Myers, Congressman Danny Davis, presidential campaign director Donna Brazile, presidential candidate and commentator Pat Buchanan, covert CIA agent Valerie Plame and her husband, Ambassador Joseph Wilson, TV anchor Laurie Dhue, political analyst Charlie Cook, and Rear Admiral Boris Lushniak.

== Controversies ==

=== Value of accreditation ===
In 1982, a 72-year-old senior judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Judge David L. Bazelon, resigned from the governing panel of the ACA with a 21-page statement of criticism. Bazelon had three years remaining on his five-year term. He described its lack of transparency and accountability, its apparent willingness to bend to political influence, and its dual role as a trade group and accreditor. Bazelon pointed out the apparent conflict of interest, writing, &quot;How can the commission in good conscience represent itself as &#x27;independent&#x27; and &#x27;unbiased&#x27; while being financially dependent on the objects of its scrutiny?&quot;

Bazelon also pointed out that ACA inspection teams at the Menard Correctional Center in Illinois, for example, did not even contact U.S. District Court Judge James L. Foreman, who had found the medical care so poor as to violate the constitution, and did not contact Dr. Lambert King, the special master Judge Foreman had appointed in 1980 to oversee the mandated improvements before they filed their approving reports.

Later critics have named several other institutions that retained their ACA accreditations while outside parties found grave violence and/or court-ordered reforms. These include:

* the private Otter Creek Correctional Center owned by CoreCivic in Floyd County, Kentucky, accredited in 2009 despite multiple charges of sexual abuse that caused the state of Hawaii to remove its inmates and the prison to be closed
* the Idaho State Correctional Center, in Kuna, operated by CoreCivic, which retained its good grades from ACA throughout a long proven pattern of violence in the prison, understaffing, operator contract fraud, and multiple federal investigations
* the private Walnut Grove Correctional Facility in Mississippi, operated by Cornell Corrections which corporation was purchased in 2010 by GEO Group, accredited in 2012 when it was a juvenile facility, the same year U.S. District Court Judge Carlton W. Reeves described it as &quot;a cesspool of unconstitutional and inhuman acts&quot;

=== Executives ===
==== Christopher B. Epps ====
On November 5, 2014, Christopher B. Epps resigned from his position as ACA president, shortly before the announcement of his indictments on dozens of corruption charges. Epps had been identified by a federal investigation conducted by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi called Operation Mississippi Hustle. He&#x27;d taken $1.47million in kickbacks, from 16 corporations, for his role in awarding nearly $1billion worth of private prison contracts. Epps also resigned from his full-time job as Corrections Commissioner for the state of Mississippi on the same day.

Epps pleaded guilty to money laundering and filing false tax returns. Many vendors were indicted, some pleaded guilty, one committed suicide, and eleven more suspects faced criminal bribery charges. The Assistant U.S. Attorney estimated the corruption&#x27;s net benefit to prison contractors exceeded $65 million. Epps personally received at least the bribes for steering what Assistant U.S. Attorney Darren LaMarca had first estimated at $800million in contracts between 2006 and 2014. Presiding Federal judge, Henry Travillion Wingate heard the cases of the others who were charged with bribing Epps.

Irb Benjamin was charged with bribery of Epps in connection with the contractual drug and alcohol treatment his company provided to MDOC prisons. Benjamin&#x27;s indictment was announced on August 22, 2015. He was paid at least $862,000 to acquire and maintain ACA accreditation for jails in numerous counties. Passing ACA standards was required if they were to be awarded contracts to hold state prisoners.

Benjamin had represented Alcorn County as a Democrat in the state House from 1976 to 1980 and state Senate from 1984 to 1992, later working for the Republican Lieutenant Governor. Alcorn County paid Benjamin, the president and lobbyist for Mississippi Correctional Management (MCM), $114,000 a year, although he lived more than 200 miles away. The Alcorn Board of Supervisors attorney said the supervisors had not been required to seek bids before giving Benjamin the contract as warden because it was a contract for services, which are exempt from bid laws.

Benjamin had received $5,000 a month to handle accreditation by the American Correctional Association for Alcorn&#x27;s Regional Correctional Facility, and he had received another $4,500 a month as the jail&#x27;s warden. Benjamin had formed MCM in 1996, when the state Department of Corrections and counties started hiring private contractors to operate prisons and smaller regional jails. It operated the Grenada County jail for years. Benjamin said the company also has jail accreditation contracts worth $4,000 or $5,000 a month with other counties including Chickasaw, Hancock, Holmes, Marion, Pearl River, Washington, and Yazoo. Prior to that he worked as a $3,000-a-month jail consultant for DeSoto County.

On June 8, 2008, DeSoto County Board of Supervisors supervisors approved the contract saying, &quot;Mr. Benjamin was recommended by Commissioner Epps at the state level.&quot; On November 25, 2014, Benjamin said that he was not aware of the Epps recommendation.

Benjamin pleaded guilty to federal charges on October 18, 2016. He faced 10 years in prison, plus a fine of up to $250,000. Federal presiding Judge Wingate sentenced Benjmain to 70 months in prison, fined Benjamin $100,000, and ordered him to forfeit $260,782.

Benjamin, who said he was &quot;pressured&quot;, estimated he had paid Epps between $180,000 and $225,000 in cash bribes to secure support for the regional jails. His plea covered bribes that had been paid for drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs that his company ran. LaMarca told Wingate, &quot;it&#x27;s just a matter of time&quot; until others whom Benjamin informed upon are indicted.

On May 25, 2017, Epps received a federal prison sentence of almost 20 years. Judge Wingate, who had been appointed to the federal bench in 1985, said, &quot;This is the largest graft operation that certainly I have seen, and I have seen a lot.&quot; Wingate cited the burglary of his former Flowood home by Epps as the reason why he gave a sentence that was much longer than the 13-year sentence recommended by prosecutors.

Epps is being held at the Federal Correctional Institution, Seagoville in Texas, near Dallas. He is due to be released on November 25, 2033.

====James A. Gondles Jr.====
James A. Gondles Jr. became the executive director of ACA in 1990, after serving as the sheriff of Arlington County, Virginia. Court records indicate a long history of suits and allegations of mistreating his staff. Gondles was accused of sexual harassment, &quot;acts of abuse of power&quot;, fraternizing and having sex with female deputies, bullying top aides, and targeting Arlington County employees who supported his opponent during his 1987 campaign for sheriff. In 1988, while he was serving as Sheriff of Arlington County, the Citizens for Law and Constitution alleged that Gondles had performed &quot;acts of abuse and power&quot; as sheriff, such as bullying aides and bragging about having sex with female deputies. Also in 1988 Gondles settled a sexual harassment suit, brought by a female deputy, with a $25,000 payment and a public apology.

<doc id="48934" wikidata="Q187117" url="?curid=48934" title="Lobbying">
<text>Lobbying is a form of advocacy, which lawfully attempts to directly influence legislators or government officials, such as regulatory agencies or judiciary. Lobbying involves direct, face-to-face contact and is carried out by various entities, including individuals acting as voters, constituents, or private citizens, corporations pursuing their business interests, nonprofits and NGOs through advocacy groups to achieve their missions, and legislators or government officials influencing each other in legislative affairs.

Lobbying or certain practices that share commonalities with lobbying are sometimes referred to as government relations, or government affairs and sometimes legislative relations, or legislative affairs. It is also an industry known by many of the aforementioned names, and has a near-complete overlap with the public affairs industry. Lobbyists may fall into different categories: amateur lobbyists, such as individual voters or voter blocs within an electoral district; professional lobbyists who engage in lobbying as a business or profession; and government relations support staff who work on behalf of professional lobbyists but may not actively engage in direct influencing or face-to-face meetings with targeted individuals to the extent required for registration as lobbyists, operating within the same professional circles as registered lobbyists.

Professional lobbyists are people whose business is trying to influence legislation, regulation, or other government decisions, actions, or policies on behalf of a group or individual who hires them. Nonprofit organizations whether as professional or amateur lobbyists can also lobby as an act of volunteering or as a small part of their normal job. Governments often define &quot;lobbying&quot; for legal purposes, and regulate organized group lobbying that has become influential.

==Criticism==
The ethics and morals involved with legally lobbying or influence peddling are controversial. Lobbying can, at times, be spoken of with contempt, when the implication is that people with inordinate socioeconomic power are corrupting the law in order to serve their own interests. When people who have a duty to act on behalf of others, such as elected officials with a duty to serve their constituents&#x27; interests or more broadly the public good, can benefit by shaping the law to serve the interests of some private parties, a conflict of interest exists. Many critiques of lobbying point to the potential for conflicts of interest to lead to agent misdirection or the intentional failure of an agent with a duty to serve an employer, client, or constituent to perform those duties. The failure of government officials to serve the public interest as a consequence of lobbying by special interests who provide benefits to the official is an example of agent misdirection. That is why lobbying is seen as one of the causes of a democratic deficit. Politicians tend to vote against the preferred position of their constituency when there is more special interest money and less attention to politics.

==Etymology==
That architectural sense of &quot;lobby&quot; is believed to originate from the medieval Latin &quot;lobia&quot; or &quot;lobium&quot;, which refers to a gallery, hall, or portico. This architectural sense was later adopted to describe the practice of advocating or debating in such spaces.

In a report carried by the BBC, an OED lexicographer has shown that &quot;lobbying&quot; finds its roots in the gathering of Members of Parliament and peers in the hallways (&quot;lobbies&quot;) of the United Kingdom Houses of Parliament before and after parliamentary debates where members of the public can meet their representatives.

One story held that the term originated at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C., where it was supposedly used by President Ulysses S. Grant to describe the political advocates who frequented the hotel&#x27;s lobby to access Grant—who was often there in the evenings to enjoy a cigar and brandy—and then tried to buy the president drinks in an attempt to influence his political decisions. Although the term may have gained more widespread currency in Washington, D.C., by virtue of this practice during the Grant Administration, the OED cites numerous documented uses of the word well before Grant&#x27;s presidency, including use in Pennsylvania as early as 1808.

The term &quot;lobbying&quot; also appeared in print as early as 1820:

==Overview==

Governments often define and regulate organized group lobbying as part of laws to prevent political corruption and by establishing transparency about possible influences by public lobby registers.

Lobby groups may concentrate their efforts on the legislatures, where laws are created, but may also use the judicial branch to advance their causes. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, for example, filed suits in state and federal courts in the 1950s to challenge segregation laws. Their efforts resulted in the Supreme Court declaring such laws unconstitutional.

Lobbyists may use a legal device known as &quot;amicus curiae&quot; () briefs to try to influence court cases. Briefs are written documents filed with a court, typically by parties to a lawsuit. &quot;Amici curiae&quot; briefs are briefs filed by people or groups who are not parties to a suit. These briefs are entered into the court records and give additional background on the matter being decided upon. Advocacy groups use these briefs both to share their expertise and to promote their positions.

The lobbying industry is affected by the revolving door concept, a movement of personnel between roles as legislators and regulators and roles in the industries affected by legislation and regulation, as the main asset for a lobbyist is contacts with and influence on government officials. This climate is attractive for ex-government officials. It can also mean substantial monetary rewards for lobbying firms, and government projects and contracts worth in the hundreds of millions for those they represent.

The international standards for the regulation of lobbying were introduced at four international organizations and supranational associations: 1) the European Union; 2) the Council of Europe; 3) the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; 4) the Commonwealth of Independent States.

=== Methods ===

In 2013, the director general of the World Health Organization, Margaret Chan, illustrated the methods used in lobbying against public health:

Lobbying can be categorized as inside lobbying, which directly interacts with decision-makers, or outside lobbying, which pressures decision-makers through mobilization of public opinion.

== History ==

In pre-modern political systems, royal courts provided incidental opportunities for gaining the ear of monarchs and their councilors.

==Lobbying by country==
===Australia===

Since the 1980s, lobbying in Australia has grown from a small industry of a few hundred employees to a multi-billion dollar per year industry. What was once the preserve of big multinational companies and at a more local level (property developers, for example, Urban Taskforce Australia) has morphed into an industry that employs more than 10,000 people and represents every facet of human endeavour.

Academic John Warhurst from the Australian National University noted that over this time, retired politicians have increasingly turned political lobbyists to leverage their networks and experience for private gain. In 2018 he noted that two of the top three Howard government ministers had become lobbyists: Alexander Downer and Peter Costello, and that the trend could be traced back to the Hawke Government of 1983. Mick Young stated that by 1983 the lobbying profession was an established part of the democratic political process in Canberra. Warhurst attests that by 2018, &quot;political leader-lobbyists&quot; were an established part of the same process. During the 1980s, political leaders traded on their own names, like Bob Hawke, or joined the &quot;respectable&quot; end of the lobbying spectrum, working for law firms or banks, like former New South Wales premiers Nick Greiner and Bob Carr. In 2008, Alexander Downer formed the lobbying firm Bespoke Approach, along with former Labor minister Nick Bolkus and Ian Smith, who is married to former Australian Democrats leader, Natasha Stott-Despoja. Peter Costello carried two former staffers to work with him in his lobbying firm, ECG Consulting: Jonathan Epstein and David Gazard. Politicians can become exposed to allegations of conflicts of interest when they both lobby and advise governments. Examples include Peter Costello.

Political party staff often form lobbying firms or dominate their ranks. Former Howard chief-of-staff Grahame Morris is the director of Barton Deakin Government Relations. His colleagues there include David Alexander (former Costello staffer), Sallyanne Atkinson (former Lord Mayor of Brisbane and former federal Liberal Party candidate), Howard staffer John Griffin and former New South Wales Liberal Party leader, Peter Collins. The Labor &quot;sister&quot; company is Hawker Britton, so named as both firms are owned by STW Group. In 2013, Hawker Britton had 113 client companies on its books.

In 2013, there were just under 280 firms on the Federal Australian Register of Lobbyists. Steve Carney of Carney Associated says that lobbyists &quot;try to leave no thumbprints on the glass, no footprints in the sand. The best lobbying is when nobody knows you were there.&quot; Mark Textor of campaign advisory group Crosby Textor describes political lobbying as a &quot;pathetic miserable industry&quot;.

==== Supermarket sector lobbying ====
Supermarket chains in Australia engage lobbying firms with political weight in their ranks. Australian Supermarket giant Coles is represented by both ECG Consulting and Bespoke Approach, while its own parent company, Wesfarmers, has former West Australian premier Alan Carpenter in charge of corporate affairs. Competitor Woolworths has a government relations team composed of former Labor and Liberal advisers, under the direction of a former leader of the National Party, Andrew Hall. Aldi engages GRA (Government Relations Australia), one of Australia&#x27;s largest lobbying firms, whose staff includes former Federal Labor treasurer, John Dawkins.

====Public lobbyist registers====
A register of federal lobbyists is kept by the Australian Government and is accessible to the public via its website. Similar registers for State government lobbyists were introduced between 2007 and 2009 around Australia. Since April 2007 in Western Australia, only lobbyists listed on the state&#x27;s register are allowed to contact a government representative for the purpose of lobbying. Similar rules have applied in Tasmania since 1 September 2009 and in South Australia and Victoria since 1 December 2009. A criticism of the lobbyist register is that it only captures professional third-party lobbyists, not employees of companies which directly lobby government. An example of this is BHP, which employs Geoff Walsh, a key advisor to Bob Hawke as an in-house lobbyist.

In 2022, The Mercury published a complete list of lobbyists registered at the Tasmanian Parliament. The field was dominated by former politicians, advisers and journalists in 2016.

===Azerbaijan===
===Bahrain===
In December 2022, Bahrain&#x27;s lobbying efforts were reflected in a report by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, which involved the name of a senior Czech MEP Tomáš Zdechovský. The controversy concerned the European Parliament&#x27;s &quot;friendship groups&quot;, the unofficial bodies operating with no formal regulations and sometimes under sponsored lobbyists and foreign governments. The European Parliament was preparing to vote on a resolution to call for the release of a Bahraini political prisoner Abdulhadi al-Khawaja. However, the chair of the European Parliament&#x27;s Bahrain friendship group, Zdechovský came under question for visiting Bahrain in April 2022, without declaring. In a separate resolution, Zdechovský&#x27;s EPP failed to call for Khawaja&#x27;s release and instead called him a &quot;political opponent&quot;. Director of BIRD, Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei accused the Czech MEP of acting as a mouthpiece for Bahrain.

=== Canada ===
Canada maintains a Registry of Lobbyists.
As of 2018, more than 5,000 people worked as registered lobbyists at Canada&#x27;s federal level. Lobbying began as an unregulated profession, but since the late 20th century has been regulated by the government to increase transparency and establish a set of ethics for both lobbyists, and those who will be lobbied. Canada does not require disclosure of lobbyist spending on lobbying activities.

===European Union===
The first step towards specialized regulation of lobbying in the European Union was a Written Question tabled by Alman Metten, in 1989. In 1991, Marc Galle, Chairman of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, was appointed to submit proposals for a Code of conduct and a register of lobbyists. Today lobbying in the European Union is an integral and important part of decision-making in the EU. From year to year lobbying regulation in the EU is constantly improving and the number of lobbyists increases. This increase in lobbying activity is a result of the growing recognition of lobbying as a critical discipline at the intersection of politics, economics, and society.

In 2003 there were around 15,000 lobbyists (consultants, lawyers, associations, corporations, NGOs etc.) in Brussels seeking to influence the EU&#x27;s legislation. Some 2,600 special interest groups had a permanent office in Brussels. Their distribution was roughly as follows: European trade federations (32%), consultants (20%), companies (13%), NGOs (11%), national associations (10%), regional representations (6%), international organizations (5%) and think tanks (1%), (Lehmann, 2003, pp iii).

In addition to this, lobby organisations sometimes hire former EU employees (a phenomenon known as the revolving door) who possess inside knowledge of the EU institutions and policy process. This practice of hiring former EU employees is part of what lobbyist Andreas Geiger describes as lobbying&#x27;s vital role in shaping law and decision-making processes, given the unique insights and access these individuals provide. A report by Transparency International EU published in January 2017 analysed the career paths of former EU officials and found that 30% of Members of the European Parliament who left politics went to work for organisations on the EU lobby register after their mandate and approximately one-third of Commissioners serving under Barroso took jobs in the private sector after their mandate, including for Uber, ArcelorMittal, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch. These potential conflicts of interest could be avoided if a stronger ethics framework were established at the EU level, including an independent ethics body and longer cooling-off periods for MEPs.

In the wake of the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal in Washington, D.C., and the massive impact this had on the lobbying scene in the United States, the rules for lobbying in the EU—which until now consisted of only a non-binding code of conduct—may also be tightened.

Eventually, on 31 January 2019, the European Parliament adopted binding rules on lobby transparency. Amending its Rules of Procedure, the Parliament stipulated that MEPs involved in drafting and negotiating legislation must publish online their meetings with lobbyists. The amendment says that &quot;rapporteurs, shadow rapporteurs or committee chairs shall, for each report, publish online all scheduled meetings with interest representatives falling under the scope of the Transparency Register&quot;- the database of the EU.

The European allies were being lobbied by the UAE and Saudi Arabia to regain diplomatic ties with the Syrian government. The two Arab countries lobbied the European Union for months, pushing them to ease the sanctions on Syria for the revival of its collapsed economy. The UAE and its neighbour country argued that without the ease of sanctions, the diplomatic efforts to end the Syrian war would be ineffective. However, the EU nations, including France and Germany, turned down the idea of restoring ties with Syria, stating that it would legitimize the regime that is accused of massacring its own people.

====France====
There is currently no regulation at all for lobbying activities in France. There is no regulated access to the French institutions and no register specific to France, but there is one for the European Union where French lobbyists are able to register themselves. For example, the internal rule of the National Assembly (art. 23 and 79) forbids members of Parliament to be linked with a particular interest. Also, there is no rule at all for consultation of interest groups by the Parliament and the Government. Nevertheless, a recent parliamentary initiative (motion for a resolution) has been launched by several MPs so as to establish a register for representatives of interest groups and lobbyists who intend to lobby the MPs.

==== Germany ====
In Germany, lobbying has existed since 1956, when the Federal Constitutional Court issued a ruling legalizing it. A mandatory lobby register (German: Lobbyliste) was introduced in Germany effective 1 January 2022, along with a code of conduct. These rules were criticized as insufficient by several opposition party members and representatives from the Council of Europe, who argued that they did not adequately address issues of transparency and potential conflicts of interest. Stricter rules are scheduled to come into effect on January 1, 2024.

==== Italy ====
Italy does not have lobbying legislation at the national level nowadays, even though there have been proposals by lawmakers over the years. In 2016, the Chamber of Deputies added an addendum that introduced a Regulation of interest representation. The Regulation expired in late 2017, when the term of the sitting Parliament expired. With the rise of the new parliamentary term in 2018, the Regulation was not being readopted. At the subnational level, only six regions have legislations about lobbying: Tuscany (2002), Molise (2004), Abruzzo (2010), Calabria (2016), Lombardy (2016) and Puglia (2017). These regional legislations have similar structure, but only Tuscany took a step forward to implement this legislation and create a public register.

In Italy, over the years, lobbies and power groups have obstructed the liberalization of markets and favored the protection of existing privileges. Despite various attempts to promote competition, such as the Law for the Market and Competition passed a year ago, the process has been riddled with delays, amendments and compromises that have weakened the law.
Pressure from various lobbies led to the deletion of several important provisions. For example, due to pressure from pharmacists, the sale of Band C drugs in supermarkets and para pharmacies was skipped. Other provisions removed include the portability of pension funds, the sale of boxes or garages worth less than one hundred thousand euros without a notarized deed, the protected energy market, and the Postal Service monopoly. In addition, the rule on RCA tariffs was withdrawn after protests from insurance companies, while the diatribe between taxi drivers and Uber was postponed for a separate measure.
Professional associations, such as lawyers and dentists, opposed measures that undermined their interests, such as the requirement for lawyers to have a quote or the requirement that dental companies be at least two-thirds owned by registered members. Other categories, such as hoteliers, called for a ban on Airbnb in the country.
The lack of competitive markets is one of the main reasons Italy has not experienced economic growth in recent years. However, pressure groups continue to defend their privileges, hindering economic liberalization. The International Monetary Fund study indicates that true liberalization could grow Italy&#x27;s GDP in a few years, but lobbies seem to be able to prevent such changes.

A 2016 study found evidence of significant indirect lobbying of then-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi through business proxies. The authors document a significant pro-Mediaset (the mass media company founded and controlled by Berlusconi) bias in the allocation of advertising spending during Berlusconi&#x27;s political tenure, in particularly for companies operating in more regulated sectors.
Using advertising data from the Nielsen AdEx database, the behavior of companies buying advertising space on Mediaset television channels during Berlusconi&#x27;s tenure as prime minister was analyzed. It is hypothesized that some companies are more likely to advertise on Mediaset channels when Berlusconi is in power, indicating a potential correlation between advertising behavior and political influence.

A model of the Italian television advertising market was developed, distinguishing between regulated firms (interested in government actions) and unregulated firms (less interested in specific public policy changes). The model predicts that advertising prices on Mediaset increase when Berlusconi is in power and that the mix of advertisers on Mediaset channels shifts toward regulated firms during his tenure.
To assess the impact of Berlusconi&#x27;s political influence, industries were ranked according to their regulatory score, obtained from a survey of Italian economists. Highly regulated industries, such as telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, and manufacturing, showed a greater tendency to allocate a portion of their advertising budgets to Mediaset during Berlusconi&#x27;s tenure. 
Despite higher prices for advertising space on Mediaset channels during Berlusconi&#x27;s tenure, companies continued to advertise, suggesting that they expect significant political benefits from supporting the network. Mediaset&#x27;s advertising partners are estimated to have paid about 1.9 billion euros more during Berlusconi&#x27;s three terms, indicating the expected political value of their indirect lobbying efforts.
This study provides evidence of market-based lobbying, in which companies strategically allocate their advertising budgets to gain political influence. It also highlights the additional conflict of interest that politicians with corporate holdings face and raises important questions about the role of money in politics beyond direct campaign contributions.

Another relevant case of lobbying that has been going on for at least 16 years concerns owners of beach establishments. Beaches are the Italian State&#x27;s properties: since 2022, owners have had to pay a fee of 2698 euros to keep a public concession of a beach establishment. This is an amount of money that would be paid back just by renting for three months 2 beach umbrellas for 15 euros each (and in many cases, the renting prices are higher). The Court of Accounts has declared an imbalance between the fee and the gains from the beach establishment. Until 2009, according to a 1949 law, people who had public concessions had the right to keep them if there was no opposition from third parties. In 2009 this law was abolished under the menace of legal procedure from the EU for infraction of a 2006 directive, that established mandatory public procedures that were impartial and transparent. Anyhow, since then, governments continuously postponed any decision regarding modifying laws on public concessions for beach establishments. Under the government of Mario Draghi, the deadline for all concessions was established for 31 December 2023: anyhow, the new Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni assured in a letter of November 3, 2022, that &quot;their government would defend the families that work in that sector&quot;, and delayed the deadline of the concessions. Some politicians claim that the families involved in the issue represent a significant and influential number of electors.
Finally, lobbying from taxi drivers represents a growing issue. The current situation in Italy regarding taxi services is regulated by Law No. 21 of 1992. According to this law, the responsibility for determining the number of taxi licenses, shifts, and fares is given to the municipalities. Taxi licenses are held by artisan business owners who have passed a driver&#x27;s exam and are registered with the Chamber of Commerce. After holding a license for five years, reaching the age of 60, or due to illness, license holders can transfer their license to someone else upon indicating their preference to the municipality. In case of death, the license can be passed to one of the heirs or their designated individuals.
Italy has an average of one taxi for every 2,000 inhabitants, whereas countries like France and Spain have ratios of 1,160 and 1,028 taxis per 2,000 inhabitants, respectively. This suggests that Italy has a relatively lower number of taxis available compared to its population.
In August 2019, the then Transport Councillor Marco Granelli acknowledged the need to increase the number of taxi licenses by 450 to meet the demand. Data showed that a significant percentage of calls for taxis were going unanswered during peak hours and weekends. However, the issue was put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it remains uncertain when it will be addressed.

==== Romania ====
Romanian legislation does not include an express regulation on lobbying activity. The legislative proposals initiated by various parliamentarians have not been finalized.

Attempts to regulate lobbying in Romania have appeared in the context of the fight against corruption. Anti-corruption strategies adopted in 2011 and 2004 mentions the purposes of the elaboration of a draft law on lobbying, as well as ensuring transparency in the decision-making activity.

In 2008 and 2011, the emphasis was mainly on transparency in the decision-making activity of the public authorities, regulation of lobbying activities no longer appeared as a distinct or expressly mentioned objective.

The Romanian Lobby Registry Association (ARRL) was founded in June 2010 to popularize and promote lobbying activity. ARRL is a non-profit legal entity that works under private law.

The majority of lobbying companies represent non-governmental organizations which activities include education, ecology, fundamental freedoms, health, consumer rights etc. Other entities that deal with lobby practice are multinational companies, Romanian companies, law firms and specialized lobby firms.

=== India ===
In India, where there is no law regulating the process, lobbying has traditionally been a tool for industry bodies like the National Association of Software and Service Companies, the Confederation of Indian Industry, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India and other pressure groups to engage with the government ahead of the national budget and legislation in parliament. Lobbying activities have frequently been identified in the context of corruption cases, for example, the 2010 controversy surrounding leaked audio transcripts of conversations between the corporate lobbyist Niira Radia and senior journalists and politicians. Besides private companies, the Indian government has been paying for the services of a US firm since 2005 to lobby, for example, in relation to the India-US civilian nuclear deal. In India, there are no laws that defined the scope of lobbying, who could undertake it, or the extent of disclosure necessary. Companies are not mandated to disclose their activities and lobbyists are neither authorized nor encouraged to reveal the names of clients or public officials they have contacted. The distinction between lobbying and bribery still remains unclear.

In 2012, Walmart revealed it had spent $25 million since 2008 on lobbying to &quot;enhance market access for investment in India&quot;. This disclosure came weeks after the Indian government made a controversial decision to permit foreign direct investment in the country&#x27;s multi-brand retail sector.

Successful grassroots lobbying campaigns include the Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan&#x27;s campaign to pass the 2005 Right to Information Act and Anna Hazare&#x27;s anti-corruption campaign to introduce the 2011 Lokpal Bill.

=== New Zealand ===
There is no register for lobbying activity and no cooling off period for public officials before they can enter the lobbying industry in New Zealand, allowing politicians and Parliamentary staffers to immediately become lobbyists after leaving office. Kris Faafoi joined a lobbying firm just three months after leaving Parliament, where he had been justice and broadcasting minister. Lobbyists also move directly into staffer positions. Gordon-Jon Thompson took a leave of absence from his lobbying firm to work as chief of staff to Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern for four months before returning to his lobbying firm. Andrew Kirton resigned from his lobbying company on 31 January 2023 and the next day was announced as chief of staff for Prime Minister Chris Hipkins.

Some &quot;ad hoc&quot; provisions against revolving door politics exist in relation to certain industries. The Immigration Advisers Licensing Act 2007, for example, prohibits Ministers of Immigration, Associate Ministers of Immigration and immigration officials from becoming a licensed immigration adviser for one year after leaving government employment.

Transparency International (TI) criticized the lack of oversight in the New Zealand lobbying industry in a November 2022 report as lax.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, lobbying plays a significant role in the formation of legislation. Various commercial organisations, lobby groups &quot;lobby&quot; for particular policies and decisions by Parliament and other political organs at national, regional and local levels.
The phrase &quot;lobbying&quot; comes from the gathering of Members of Parliament and peers in the hallways (or lobbies) of Houses of Parliament before and after parliamentary debates. The now-defunct UK Public Affairs Council (UKPAC) defined lobbying as:
in a professional capacity, attempting to influence, or advising those who wish to influence, the UK Government, Parliament, the devolved legislatures or administrations, regional or local government or other public bodies on any matter within their competence. Formal procedures enable individual members of the public to lobby their Member of Parliament but most lobbying activity centres on corporate, charity and trade association lobbying, where organisations seek to amend government policy through advocacy.

===United States===


In the United States, some special interests hire professional advocates to argue for specific legislation in decision-making bodies, such as Congress. Some lobbyists are now using social media to reduce the cost of traditional campaigns, and to more precisely target public officials with political messages.

A 2011 study of the 50 firms that spent the most on lobbying relative to their assets compared their financial performance against that of the S&amp;P 500, and concluded that spending on lobbying was a &quot;spectacular investment&quot; yielding &quot;blistering&quot; returns comparable to a high-flying hedge fund, even despite the financial downturn. A 2011 meta-analysis of previous research findings found a positive correlation between corporate political activity and firm performance. A 2009 study found that lobbying brought a return on investment of as much as 22,000% in some cases. Major American corporations spent $345 million lobbying for just three pro-immigration bills between 2006 and 2008. A review of 30 food and beverage companies spent $38.2 million on lobbying in 2020 to strengthen and maintain their influence in Washington, D.C.

A study from the Kellogg School of Management found that political donations by corporations do not increase shareholder value. The authors posit a few reasons that firms continue giving despite little returns, including signaling firm values to investors and consumption value for individual managers.

Wall Street spent a record $2 billion trying to influence the 2016 United States presidential election.

====Foreign lobbying====

Foreign-funded lobbying efforts include those of Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Pakistan, and China lobbies. In 2010 alone, foreign governments spent approximately $460 million on lobbying members of Congress and government officials.

In the US, lobbying for foreign governments is not illegal, but it requires registering as a foreign agent with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). Unofficially, according to &quot;Politico&quot;, &#x27;many lobbyists try to avoid representing countries that have tense relationships with Washington or troubled human rights records&#x27;. Between 2015 and 2017, around 145 registered lobbyists were paid $18 million by Saudi Arabia to influence the U.S. government.

In January 2017, an order by Donald Trump led to a lifetime ban on administration officials from lobbying for foreign governments and a five-year ban on other forms of lobbying. However, the rule was revoked by Trump right before the end of his presidency. A number of Trump allies were found guilty of lobbying on behalf of foreign governments during the 2016 US elections, including Paul Manafort; Elliott Broidy pleaded guilty in October 2020 to failing to register as a lobbyist for a foreign individual. On January 19, 2021, President Trump granted Mr. Broidy a full and unconditional pardon.

===United Arab Emirates===

The United Arab Emirates has a long history of lobbying government and politicians in the West for its conflict of interest concerning building influence and using it to impact the country&#x27;s foreign policy. In November 2022 it was accused of hiring PR and lobbying firms in order to promote to the politicians in the United States about its selection to host the COP28 Climate Conference. The problem was that the promotion started even before Egypt hosted 2022&#x27;s COP27 Climate event. Fleishmann Hillard were hired to compose letters that proposed the idea of Emirati ministers attending conferences and events and using the phrase &quot;the UAE is hosting COP28 next year&quot;. Whereas, Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld were hired to reach out to US politicians particularly pushing the environmental policies or favouring fossil fuels in addition to informing them about the UAE hosting COP28. The Gulf nation even declared its intentions of achieving net zero emissions by 2050, even though 30% of their GDP relies on oil and gas directly, while the remaining relies upon industry run on heavy energy consumption.

In February 2024, New Westminster Mayor Patrick Johnstone faced scrutiny after attending the COP28 conference. Johnstone&#x27;s expenses, including the conference fees, travel and accommodation, were incurred by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, of which Dubai is a member of the sterling committee. Councillors Daniel Fontaine and Paul Minhas filed a complaint against Johnstone for breaking the state&#x27;s code of conduct. The investigation was assigned to Commissioner Jennifer Devins, who, in her October 2024 report, stated that Johnstone&#x27;s trip provided personal benefits, which councillors are restricted from accepting. While Devins did not impose sanctions, she recommended Johnstone to take training on the laws of country.

A firm based in UAE, Alasriya Media Consultancy paid $10,000 a former CIA analyst Larry Johnson to run his podcast Counter Currents. The podcast discusses global politics, including a pro-Russian narrative of the Ukraine war and US foreign policy in the Middle East. The contract was signed in May 2024, but was not disclosed in FARA filing until November. The Emirati firm is represented by a Lebanese celebrity journalist, Ghina Amyouni, whose reason for funding the podcast was unclear.

*Israel (1994) – a unique lobby which is called &quot;Lobby 99&quot; is working at the Israeli parliament. This is a lobby which is funded by the people by crowdfunding and working for the people, the 99 percent who are not among the elites which most lobbying companies represent.
*Ukraine: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has signed into law the much-anticipated legislation on lobbying, officially known as draft law No. 10337
*Kazakhstan: Since 1998, Kazakhstan has been trying to pass a law on lobbying. The National Chamber of Entrepreneurs of Kazakhstan &quot;Atameken&quot; is one of the first official lobbying structures in the country, but there are other examples.
*South Korea: In South Korea, lobbying is viewed as a form of corruption and is illegal.

<text>The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) is a nonprofit organization of conservative state legislators and private sector representatives who draft and share model legislation for distribution among state governments in the United States.

ALEC provides a forum for state legislators and private sector members to collaborate on model bills—draft legislation that members may customize and introduce for debate in their own state legislatures. ALEC has produced model bills on a broad range of issues, such as reducing regulation and individual and corporate taxation, combating illegal immigration, loosening environmental regulations, tightening voter identification rules, weakening labor unions, and opposing gun control. Some of these bills dominate legislative agendas in states such as Arizona, Wisconsin, Colorado, Michigan, New Hampshire, and Maine. Approximately 200 model bills become law each year. ALEC also serves as a networking tool among certain state legislators, allowing them to research conservative policies implemented in other states. Many ALEC legislators say the organization converts campaign rhetoric and nascent policy ideas into legislative language.

ALEC&#x27;s activities, while legal, received public scrutiny after news reports in 2012 from outlets such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; described ALEC as an organization that gave corporate interests outsized influence. Resulting public pressure led to a number of legislators and corporations withdrawing from the organization. In 2022, however, &quot;Insider&quot; reported that a political commentator addressing the July policy summit of ALEC stated that if the objective of the conservative constitutional convention movement that &quot;is gaining momentum&quot; largely out of public view is successful in its effort to rewrite the constitution, the USA will become the &quot;conservative nation&quot; ALEC has been working toward.

==History==
===1973 to 2010===
ALEC was founded in 1973 in Chicago as the Conservative Caucus of State Legislators, a project initiated by Mark Rhoads, an Illinois state house staffer, to counter the Environmental Protection Agency, wage, and price controls, and to respond to the defeat of Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election.

Conservative legislators felt the word &quot;conservative&quot; was unpopular with the public at the time, however, so the organization was renamed as, the American Legislative Exchange Council. In 1975, with the support of the American Conservative Union, ALEC registered as a federal nonprofit agency. Bill Moyers and Greenpeace have attributed the establishment of ALEC to the influential Powell Memorandum, which led to the rise of a new business activist movement in the 1970s.

ALEC was co-founded by conservative activist Paul Weyrich, who also co-founded the Heritage Foundation. Henry Hyde, who later became a U.S. congressman, and Lou Barnett, who later became national political director of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Political Action Committee, also helped to found ALEC. Early members included a number of state and local politicians who went on to statewide office, including Bob Kasten, Tommy Thompson, and Scott Walker of Wisconsin, John Engler of Michigan, Terry Branstad of Iowa, Mitch Daniels of Indiana, and John Boehner and John Kasich of Ohio. Several members of Congress also were involved in the organization during its early years, including Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Sen. James L. Buckley of New York, Rep. Phil Crane of Illinois, and Rep Eric Cantor of Virginia.

In the 1980s, ALEC opposed U.S. disinvestment from South Africa, a movement to put pressure on the South African government to embark on negotiations with a goal of dismantling apartheid. In 1985, ALEC also published a memo that opposed &quot;the current homosexual movement&quot;, portrayed homosexuality as a result of a conscious choice, and said that pedophilia was &quot;one of the more dominant practices within the homosexual world&quot;. ALEC spokesman Bill Meierling discussed the document in 2013 and said that ALEC does not draft model bills on social issues, and added, &quot;I&#x27;m also sad that the critics would not acknowledge that organizations change over time.&quot;

Duane Parde served as the executive director from December 1996 to January 2006. Lori Roman, who served in the same role from 2006 to 2008, had an imperious style that led to financial difficulties and the departure of two thirds of ALEC&#x27;s staff. According to Dolores Mertz, then a Democratic Iowa state representative and chairwoman of the ALEC board, ALEC became increasingly partisan during that period, with Roman once telling Mertz &quot;she didn&#x27;t like Democrats and she wasn&#x27;t going to work with them.&quot; Ron Scheberle became executive director in 2010 after acting as a lobbyist for Verizon Communications (previously GTE) and as an ALEC board member.

By 2011, the number of ALEC legislative members had reached 2,000, including more than 25 percent of all state legislators nationwide. Approximately 1,000 bills based on ALEC language were being introduced in state legislatures every year, with approximately 20% of those bills being enacted.

===Since 2011===
Prior to 2011, ALEC&#x27;s practices and its ties to specific pieces of legislation were little known outside of political circles. In July 2011, &quot;The Nation&quot; published a series of articles produced in collaboration with the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) that showcased some of the ALEC model bills and described ties to the Koch family, and CMD launched a website &quot;ALEC Exposed&quot; that documented more than 800 of ALEC model bills, the legislators and corporations that had helped to draft them, and the states that enacted them.

The joint effort, and particularly its coverage of ALEC&#x27;s push for tough voter ID laws, prompted the advocacy group Color of Change to launch a public campaign to pressure corporations to withdraw their ALEC memberships.

The criticism among media outlets and political opponents was that ALEC was secretly subverting democratic institutions to further the aims of its corporate benefactors. Oregon state representative and ALEC member Gene Whisnant said in December 2011, &quot;We&#x27;re getting a lot of attention saying we&#x27;re trying to destroy the earth and everything on it.&quot; ALEC staff and members promoted the organization as promoting public-private partnerships for the advancement of free market principles. ALEC senior director of membership and development Chaz Cirame said, &quot;The hook about some conspiracy or some secret organization is a lot better story than one about bringing state legislators together to talk about best practices around the country.&quot;

In 2012, ALEC was the subject of an Occupy movement protest, an Internal Revenue Service complaint by Common Cause, and calls for attorney general investigations in several states.

The killing of Trayvon Martin on February 26, 2012, led to increased public attention on &quot;Stand-your-ground&quot; gun laws that ALEC had supported. Color of Change launched a new campaign in April to pressure ALEC corporate members to withdraw. More than sixty corporations and foundations, including Coca-Cola, Wendy&#x27;s, Kraft Foods, McDonald&#x27;s, Amazon.com, General Electric, Apple, Procter &amp; Gamble, Walmart, the Gates Foundation, and the medical insurance group Blue Cross and Blue Shield dropped support of ALEC in the ensuing weeks or let their memberships lapse. Thirty-four legislative members also left ALEC.

ALEC responded by releasing a statement describing efforts by its critics as a &quot;campaign launched by a coalition of extreme liberal activists committed to silencing anyone who disagrees with their agenda&quot;. Doug Clopp of Common Cause credited ALEC Exposed for the successful campaign, saying that &quot;for 40 years you couldn&#x27;t get the kind of accountability we&#x27;re seeing now because ALEC, its members, its legislators, its bills were secret.&quot;

Former Visa Inc. lobbyist, Newt Gingrich aide, and GOPAC executive director, Lisa B. Nelson, succeeded Scheberle as CEO of ALEC in 2014.

In late 2014, a number of technology-oriented companies such as Google, Microsoft, Facebook, eBay, and Yahoo! announced that they were ending their ties to ALEC. Multiple companies cited environmental concerns as a point of contention with the organization. Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt remarked that ALEC was &quot;just literally lying&quot; about recent global climate change. Yahoo!, Uber, and Lyft also announced withdrawals later that same week. Occidental Petroleum and Northrop Grumman also cut ties with ALEC. In response to the departure of Northrop Grumman, an ALEC spokesperson said, &quot;Like any other membership group, membership in ALEC ebbs and flows, and in 2014 we gained far more private-sector members than we lost.&quot; T-Mobile and BP severed ties with ALEC in 2015.

In 2023, ALEC held its fiftieth anniversary celebrations in Washington, D.C. The celebrations included a gala event at the National Portrait Gallery.

ALEC is a member of the advisory board of Project 2025, a collection of conservative and right-wing policy proposals from the Heritage Foundation to reshape the United States federal government and consolidate executive power should the Republican nominee win the 2024 presidential election.

==Organization==
As of December 2013, ALEC had more than 85 members of Congress and 14 sitting or former governors who were considered &quot;alumni&quot;. The majority of the ALEC legislative members belong to the Republican Party. Membership statistics presented at an ALEC board meeting in 2013 indicated that the 1,810 members represented 24% of all state legislative seats across the U.S., and that ALEC members represented 100% of the legislative seats in Iowa and South Dakota. It also has approximately 300 corporate, foundation, and other private-sector members. The chairmanship of ALEC is a rotating position, with a new legislator appointed to the position each year. , 28 out of 33 of its chairs had been Republicans.

ALEC has nine task forces that generate model bills that members may customize and introduce for debate in their own state legislatures. Private sector members effectively have veto power over model bills drafted by the task forces.

The ALEC Public Safety and Elections Task Force, which promoted stand your ground gun laws and voter identification requirements, was disbanded in April 2012. Thereafter, the National Center for Public Policy Research announced the creation of a voter ID task force to replace the one discontinued by ALEC.

Bills drafted by the task forces must be approved by the ALEC board of directors, composed exclusively of legislators, before they are designated as model bills. ALEC also has a Private Enterprise Advisory Council, which meets whenever the board of directors meets. Council members include representatives from prominent corporations such as ExxonMobil, Pfizer, AT&amp;T, SAP, State Farm Insurance and Koch Industries. ALEC statements assert that the council provides advice to the board of directors. Former ALEC co-chairman Noble Ellington said in 2011, &quot;I really kind of think of us as one board,&quot; although he added, &quot;It&#x27;s certainly not our goal to sit there and do everything that business wants to have done.&quot;

Day-to-day operations are run from ALEC&#x27;s Arlington County, Virginia, office by an executive director and a staff of approximately 30. ALEC&#x27;s bylaws specify that &quot;... full membership shall be open to persons dedicated to the preservation of individual liberty, basic American values and institutions, productive free enterprise, and limited representative government, who support the purposes of ALEC, and who serve, or formerly serve, as members of a state or territorial legislature, the United States Congress, or similar bodies outside the United States.&quot;

ALEC also has a Board of Scholars that advises staff and members. The board is composed of Arthur Laffer, an economist who served on Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Economic Policy Advisory Board; Victor Schwartz, chair of Public Policy at Shook, Hardy &amp; Bacon; Richard Vedder, economics professor emeritus at Ohio University and adjunct scholar at the American Enterprise Institute; and Rob Natelson, a constitutional scholar.

ALEC also has ties to the State Policy Network (SPN), a national association of conservative and libertarian think-tanks. SPN is a member of ALEC, and ALEC is an associate member of the SPN. SPN encourages its members to join ALEC, and many members of SPN are also members of ALEC. Some of the think tanks in the SPN write model legislation, which then is introduced at ALEC private meetings. ALEC is &quot;SPN&#x27;s sister organisation&quot; according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;. ALEC is also a member of the Atlas Network, a global organization of free-market think tanks.

As of 2012, ALEC is registered as a charity in 37 states.

==Notable policies and model bills==
The ALEC website states that its goal is to advance &quot;the fundamental principles of free-market enterprise, limited government, and federalism&quot;. In 2003, Donald Ray Kennard, then a Louisiana state representative and ALEC national chairman, said, &quot;We are a very, very conservative organization... We&#x27;re just espousing what we really believe in.&quot; Craig Horn, a North Carolina state representative and ALEC member, said of ALEC in 2013, &quot;It&#x27;s a lightning rod organization because it has a decidedly conservative bent—there’s no doubt about it.&quot;

Although ALEC originally focused on social issues such as abortion, which it opposed, in more recent years the group has focused more on business and regulatory matters. According to John Nichols of &quot;The Nation&quot;, ALEC&#x27;s agenda &quot;seems to be dictated at almost every turn by multinational corporations. It&#x27;s to clear the way for lower taxes, less regulation, a lot of protection against lawsuits, [and] ALEC is very, very active in [the] opening up of areas via privatization for corporations to make more money, particularly in places you might not usually expect like public education.&quot;

A Brookings Institution study of state legislation introduced in 2011–2012 found that ALEC model bills that became law were linked most often to controversial social and economic issues. The study concluded that this phenomenon has hurt ALEC because, &quot;Dirtying its hands with social issues undermines ALEC&#x27;s ability to exercise influence over fiscal ones.&quot;

According to research by Columbia University political scientist Alex Hertel-Fernandez, ALEC model legislation during the late 1970s focused primarily on social issues, such as abortion, drugs, gun laws, religious freedom and anti-busing. By the 1980s, the focus was primarily on criminal justice. By the 1990s, the focus was overwhelmingly on business deregulation.

===&#x27;Stand Your Ground&#x27; laws===
Stand-your-ground laws expanded to 30 states through the support of ALEC, after Florida passed its law in 2005. After the Florida law had been passed, ALEC adopted a model bill with the same wording. In the wake of the killing of Trayvon Martin in 2012, ALEC&#x27;s support for Stand Your Ground laws ultimately led to the departure of high-profile corporate members such as Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Bank of America, and General Motors.

=== Voter ID laws ===
After Obama&#x27;s victory in the 2008 presidential election, ALEC&#x27;s internal publication (which it provides to paying members) asserted, without evidence, that voter fraud contributed to his victory. ALEC said that groups like ACORN had engaged in voter-registration fraud whereby fake voter registrations were submitted.

Prior to 2012, legislation based on ALEC model bills was introduced in many states to mandate or strengthen requirements that voters produce state-issued photographic identification. The bills were passed and signed into law in six states. Voter identification bills introduced in 34 states would have made voting more difficult for students, the elderly, and the poor. According to research by Columbia University political scientist Alex Hertel-Fernandez, &quot;Of the 62 ID laws states considered during the 2011 and 2012 legislative sessions, more than half were proposed by lawmakers who... were all participants in the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC. In exchange for their payments of $50 per year in membership dues, those legislators had access to a draft proposal for strict voter ID requirements&quot;.

===Immigration===

The &quot;Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act&quot;, an Arizona law commonly known as &quot;SB 1070&quot;, was drafted during an ALEC meeting in December 2009 and became an ALEC model bill. Enacted in 2010, SB 1070 was described as the toughest illegal immigration law in the U.S. Portions of SB 1070 were held by the Supreme Court to be preempted by federal law in 2012.

Bills similar to SB 1070 were passed in Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, and Utah, and have been introduced in 17 other states.

A 2018 study characterized ALEC as highly influential in the spread of policies intended to curb sanctuary cities (jurisdictions where immigration enforcement is not a law enforcement priority).

===Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act===
One of ALEC&#x27;s model bills is the &quot;Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act&quot;, which classifies certain property destruction, acts of intimidation, and civil disobedience by environmental and animal rights activists as terrorism. This model bill appeared across the U.S. in various forms since it was drafted in 2003. The federal &quot;Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act&quot; has notable similarities, and at points almost verbatim language, to ALEC&#x27;s model &quot;Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act&quot;. The Senate version of the &quot;Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act&quot; was sponsored by Senator James Inhofe, a long-time member of ALEC.

Many ag-gag bills are also similar to ALEC&#x27;s model &quot;Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act&quot;, which would make it against the law to film, videotape, or take photographs on livestock farms in order to &quot;defame the facility or its owner&quot;. People found to be in violation would be put in a &quot;terrorist registry&quot;.

===Criminal sentencing and prison management===
According to &quot;Governing&quot; magazine, &quot;ALEC has been a major force behind both privatizing state prison space and keeping prisons filled.&quot; ALEC has developed model bills advancing &quot;tough on crime&quot; initiatives, including &quot;truth in sentencing&quot; and &quot;three strikes&quot; laws. Critics argue that by funding and participating in ALEC&#x27;s Criminal Justice Task Force, private prison companies directly influence legislation for tougher, longer sentences. Corrections Corporation of America and Wackenhut Corrections, two of the largest for-profit prison companies in the U.S. (), have been contributors to ALEC. ALEC also has worked to pass state laws to allow the creation of private-sector for-profit prisons.

Marie Gottschalk, professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania, said that ALEC has played a major role in &quot;liberating the private sector to employ penal labor and expand the privatization of corrections.&quot; Economist Paul Krugman wrote in 2012 that ALEC had &quot;a special interest in privatization—that is, on turning the provision of public services, from schools to prisons, over to for-profit corporations,&quot; and as such played a significant role in the &quot;penal–industrial complex&quot;. As an example, Krugman wrote that the American Bail Coalition had declared publicly that ALEC was its &quot;life preserver.&quot;

By 2013, ALEC disbanded the task force that favored harsh sentencing and supported reducing prison overcrowding and lowering the costs associated with the criminal justice system. At that time, ALEC promoted investing taxpayer money in alternatives to incarceration, such as electronic monitoring.

===Energy and the environment===
ALEC pushed for deregulation of the electricity industry in the 1990s. Maneuvering between two private sector members, the former energy trader, Enron, and the utilities trade association, Edison Electric Institute (EEI), resulted in EEI withdrawing its ALEC membership. Enron&#x27;s position on the matter was adopted by ALEC and subsequently, by many state legislatures.

In 2011, ALEC adopted model legislation having to do with public &quot;right to know&quot; laws regarding what fluids are used in hydraulic fracturing (also known as &quot;fracking&quot;) that was promoted as a victory for the right of consumers to know about potential drinking water contaminants, in spite of the fact that the bill contained &quot;loopholes that would allow energy companies to withhold the names of certain fluid contents, for reasons including that they have been deemed trade secrets&quot;.

ALEC has promoted a model bill that called plans in 2011 by the federal Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, a &quot;train wreck&quot; that would harm the economy, and it has supported efforts by various states to withdraw from regional climate change compacts. In 2013, their resolution stated &quot;Alec is very concerned about the potential economic impact of greenhouse gas regulation on electricity prices and the harm EPA regulations may have on the economic recovery&quot;. ALEC also has promoted a model bill that would call on the federal government to approve the proposed Keystone XL project, which would extend a synthetic crude oil pipeline from oil sands in Alberta, Canada to Nebraska.

In 2013, ALEC planned legislation that would weaken state clean energy regulations and penalize homeowners who install their own solar panels and redistribute the electricity back into the grid, whom ALEC has described as &quot;freeriders&quot; because they do not pay for the infrastructure costs of recirculating their generated power.

Also in 2013, ALEC adopted a model bill saying that the role of human activity in causing climate change was uncertain, that man-made climate change could be &quot;deleterious, neutral or possibly beneficial,&quot; and that the cost of regulating greenhouse gas emissions could cause &quot;great economic dislocation.&quot; ALEC also has invited climate change deniers, such as Craig Idso, to speak at its national meetings. In 2015 Common Cause and the League of Conservation Voters pointed to such behavior to accuse ALEC of denying climate change. ALEC responded by threatening legal action, denying that ALEC supports climate change denial, and saying it has more recently welcomed debate on the subject and supported renewable energy and carbon tax policies to curb global warming.

Several corporations have announced that their affiliations with ALEC will be allowed to lapse over disagreement with the group&#x27;s opposition to action on climate change. These include Ford, BP, Microsoft, Google and Shell. A statement by Shell said &quot;its stance on climate change is clearly inconsistent with our own...We have long recognized both the importance of the climate challenge and the critical role energy has in determining quality of life for people across the world.&quot; An ALEC spokesperson responded &quot;Climate change activists have conflated our opposition to the government picking winners and losers as climate change denial.&quot;

In December 2016, Tesla Motors (not an ALEC member) hosted an ALEC event in Washington, D.C., where ALEC promoted its &quot;Energy Innovation Project&quot;, that was partly funded by the ClearPath Foundation. The project guides states toward innovation and entrepreneurship surrounding U.S. energy resources.

ALEC has promoted draft bills for restrictions on single-use plastic drinking straws. The draft bill contains exemptions for fast food and fast casual restaurants, and preempts municipalities from imposing stricter regulations.

===Telecommunications and information technology===
AT&amp;T and Verizon drafted ALEC model legislation prohibiting public broadband services and &quot;sunsetting&quot; the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). Names of its 172-member task force, the agenda of a December 2010 meeting, and its minutes that included a resolution regarding traffic pumping were published by Common Cause. In February 2014, Senate Bill 304 in Kansas was introduced, &quot;prohibiting cities and counties from building public broadband networks and providing internet service to businesses and citizens&quot;. The bill contains an &quot;underserved area&quot; exemption for public wi-fi, but the exemption criterion is not met anywhere in Kansas. The city of Chanute, Kansas, which has led broadband development since the 1980s, financed through its public electricity company, including free wi-fi in its college, hospital, and public spaces, and a 4g mobile data network, felt under attack by the bill. The bill failed.

===Health care===
ALEC opposes the individual health insurance mandate enacted by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly known as the &quot;ACA&quot; or &quot;Obamacare&quot;). ALEC filed an amicus brief in &quot;National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius&quot;, urging the Supreme Court to strike down the individual mandate of the ACA. In 2011, ALEC published the &quot;State Legislators Guide to Repealing ObamaCare&quot;, which has served as a road map for repeal efforts. ALEC also has drafted a variety of model bills designed to block implementation of the law.

In August 2013, ALEC approved the &quot;Health Care Freedom Act&quot; as a model bill that aims to strip health insurers of their licenses to do business at the federal health care exchanges of ACA if they accepted any subsidies under the system. Sean Riley, the head of the ALEC Health and Human Services task force, said the aim of the proposed legislation was to protect businesses from the ACA&#x27;s employer mandate. &quot;Slate&quot; journalist David Weigel has called the bill a &quot;sneak attack&quot; on the ACA. Health insurance experts have predicted that if the bill were widely adopted by Republican-controlled states, it would seriously disrupt the exchange and threaten the ACA. Wendell Potter, former health insurance executive and CMD fellow, said, &quot;You cannot build the healthcare system based on the free market unless you have subsidies. If they are taken away the whole thing collapses.&quot;

In 1989, ALEC published the draft &quot;HIV Assault Act&quot;, which made it a crime for someone who is knowingly infected with HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) to have sex with a person who is not infected, without disclosing the HIV infection. The bill made having such sex without disclosure a criminal offense, even when HIV was not transmitted. Alan Smith, who worked on the draft, said the proposed law was a response to worries that people with AIDS were deliberately infecting others, &quot;to make sure more people got it so more research money could be devoted to curing it&quot;.

===LGBT rights===
In the 1980s, ALEC pushed anti-gay propaganda, and urged legislators to oppose attempts to &quot;homosexualize society.&quot; ALEC said that homosexual relations were &quot;probably some of the most destructive and degrading institutions in America today&quot;. ALEC claimed homosexuality caused psychological harm, led to pedophilia, and that homosexuals sought to recruit the young.

An investigation by the Southern Poverty Law Center and The Center for Media and Democracy found that ALEC is part of a coalition of groups called Back to Neutral who oppose &quot;&#x27;woke&#x27; corporations that act to diversify their leadership or take a public stance on social and democracy issues.&quot; According to the SPLC, the Back to the Neutral coalition includes &quot;right-wing think tanks, advocacy groups, media organizations and two anti-LGBTQ hate groups.&quot;

===Other issues===
ALEC has worked to privatize public education, frequently promoting model bills that expand public-private partnerships in education.

It has provided model legislation that led to the enactment of aggressive personal and corporate income tax cuts in Kansas in 2012. Governor Sam Brownback, who promoted and signed the legislation, was advised by the supply-side economist and ALEC board member, Arthur Laffer, who said at the time that the cuts would pay for themselves and lead to increased growth. By fall 2014, however, the tax cuts had led to the depletion of a $700 million budget surplus, and although Kansas had experienced 6.6% job growth from 2010 to 2013, that figure lagged behind the nation&#x27;s overall 8.8% job growth for the same period.

It also has promoted a model bill that limits liability for parent companies that acquire subsidiaries responsible for asbestos-related injuries.

===Smoking===

In 1986, while ALEC was funded by the tobacco industry, it disputed the science linking tobacco smoke to health harms.

In July 2012, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that ALEC had taken action to oppose plain cigarette packaging laws outside the United States, including the UK and Australia. Karla Jones, a task force director for ALEC, said that the brands were the corporations&#x27; most valuable assets. ALEC stated that generic cigarette packaging increased cigarette consumption, rather than reduced it. ALEC&#x27;s advocacy against &quot;plain packaging&quot; of tobacco products was cited as partial motivation for an academic study on the effectiveness of plain packaging, which found that &quot;plain packaging can reduce positive perceptions of smoking and dissuade tobacco use.&quot;

== Training and assistance ==
In addition to providing a forum for the drafting of model legislation that may be adapted easily, ALEC also provides assistance and training to its legislative members. The Oregon co-chairman of ALEC, Gene Whisnant, described the organization in 2012 as a &quot;great resource&quot; for part-time legislators with limited staff resources. Mark Pocan, a Democratic congressman from Wisconsin and former member of the Wisconsin Assembly, said in 2012 that ALEC advises members, &quot;&#x27;Don&#x27;t just introduce a single piece of legislation, introduce 14.&#x27; That way people can&#x27;t oppose any one bill.&quot; At one ALEC meeting, media experts gave messaging advice and taught legislators how to use Twitter to move ALEC bills through their chambers. Attendants also offered to write op-ed articles in local newspapers for the legislators and to put lawmakers in touch with other subject matter experts.

==Secrecy and transparency==
Although &quot;Governing Magazine&quot; reported in 2003 that ALEC meetings traditionally had been open to the public, news organizations have reported since then that many meetings are held in private. ALEC policy seminars are open to reporters and other nonmembers, but public conference agendas, unlike those distributed to members, do not include the names of presenters, the lists of legislative and private-sector board chairs, nor the corporate sponsors of the seminars. Task force meetings and bill-drafting sessions are held behind closed doors. Bloggers from ThinkProgress and AlterNet were removed from conferences for attempting to take photographs of such sessions and tweeting the names of ALEC members who participated. In 2013, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; columnist Dana Milbank was turned away from the ALEC annual policy summit and told by spokesperson Bill Meierling that subcommittee meetings and task force meetings were closed-door. Meierling said ALEC was introducing transparency gradually, but it &quot;can&#x27;t just kick the doors open&quot;. Shortly after the Milbank incident, the Brookings Institution reported that ALEC&#x27;s activities during its closed-door meetings are &quot;still a mystery&quot;, and that &quot;ALEC could have a tremendous influence over lawmaking in the American states, or it could have none at all—we just don&#x27;t know.&quot; In 2014, Nebraska legislator and former ALEC member Jeremy Nordquist described ALEC as a &quot;faceless organization&quot;, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s allowing these corporate interests to just duck and cover, and hide from really stepping into the public square and putting their ideas forward.&quot;

ALEC does not disclose its membership list nor the origins of its model bills. Lawmakers generally propose ALEC-drafted bills in their states without disclosing the ALEC authorship. For instance, in 2012 &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot; analyzed more than 100 bills and regulations previously proposed by the administration of New Jersey governor Chris Christie and found a pattern of similarities with ALEC model bills that was &quot;too strong to be accidental&quot;. The connections were based &quot;not on similarity of broad ideas, but on specific numbers, time frames, benchmarks and language&quot;. Legislative staffers in the Christie administration had &quot;mined ALEC for advice on budgetary matters, Medicaid changes and privatizing government services...beginning in the earliest days of Christie&#x27;s governorship&quot;. William Schluter, vice chairman of the New Jersey Ethics Commission and a former Republican state senator, said there was a &quot;clear connection between ALEC and the proposed New Jersey legislation&quot;. A Christie spokesperson denied any connection between the two.

One exception to this pattern came in November 2011, when former Florida State Representative Rachel Burgin introduced legislation to call on the federal government to reduce its corporate tax rate. She mistakenly included the boilerplate &quot;WHEREAS, it is the mission of the American Legislative Exchange Council to advance Jeffersonian principles of free markets, limited government, federalism, and individual liberty...&quot; When the inclusion of the ALEC mission statement was discovered, the bill was withdrawn and resubmitted without the phrase. &quot;The American Prospect&quot; journalist Abby Rapoport wrote that the incident &quot;seems to confirm what many have assumed was occurring in state legislatures—and while Burgin&#x27;s bill was hardly a major piece of legislation, ALEC&#x27;s reach in important policy areas seems hard to overestimate.&quot;

Critics sometimes argue that by adopting ALEC model bills without disclosure, state officials are handing off the duty of doing their own work to a business-centered lobby. In early 2012, Democratic lawmakers in Arizona and Wisconsin introduced the &quot;ALEC Accountability Act of 2012&quot;, which would have required corporations to disclose ALEC funding. Arizona House of Representatives Assistant Minority Leader Steve Farley, sponsor of the Arizona bill, argued that corporations have the right to present arguments, but not secretly.

Prior to 2013, access to ALEC model bills was restricted, and its website required a password to access them. On July 13, 2011, the Center for Media and Democracy, in cooperation with &quot;The Nation&quot;, posted 850 model bills created during a 30-year period, and created a web project, &quot;ALEC Exposed&quot;, to host these model bills. The leak has been credited with triggering critical coverage about ALEC in both left-wing and mainstream media outlets. ALEC subsequently published its model bills on its website, although the Brookings Institution wrote in 2013 that there was &quot;reason to believe&quot; its list was incomplete.

On October 1, 2012, Common Cause, a liberal political advocacy group, along with the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD), filed a lawsuit under a Wisconsin open records law alleging five Republican lawmakers did not disclose whether they had used personal e-mail accounts for correspondence with ALEC. In one instance, a Wisconsin legislative representative had requested of ALEC in June 2012 that all correspondence be sent to his personal account. According to CMD, the legislators settled the suit in late October 2012, allowing their personal e-mails to be searched for such contacts and paying $2,500 in court costs as part of the settlement.

In 2013, ALEC&#x27;s North Carolina state chairman Jason Saine described the organization as &quot;a resource for experts you can tap that follow a philosophy that you do from a less government viewpoint&quot;, and said, &quot;It&#x27;s not just some big secretive organization that it&#x27;s been portrayed.&quot;

==Corporate influence and allegations of lobbying activity==
===Corporate influence===
The level of influence that the ALEC private-sector members hold over its public-sector members has been controversial. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, special interests have effectively turned ALEC&#x27;s lawmaker members into &quot;stealth lobbyists&quot; for conservative causes. &quot;The Guardian&quot; has described ALEC as &quot;a dating agency for Republican state legislators and big corporations,&quot; to set rightwing legislative agendas. The &quot;Free Lance-Star&quot; has reported that ALEC had become &quot;one of Big Business&#x27;s most effective lobbying tools&quot;. &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; described the organization as a &quot;bill laundry&quot; that &quot;offers companies substantial benefits that seem to have little to do with ideology.&quot; Chris Taylor, a Democratic Wisconsin state assemblyman who attended an ALEC conference in 2013, said, &quot;In my observation, it was the corporations and the right-wing think tanks driving the agendas. Corporations have as big a say as the legislators in the model legislation that is adopted.&quot;

ALEC legislative members generally deny being overly influenced by the organization or its model legislation, and argue that corporate input in the drafting process helps to promote business growth. &quot;ALEC is unique in the sense that it puts legislators and companies together and they create policy collectively,&quot; said Scott Pruitt, then an Oklahoma state representative and ALEC task force chair. Vance Wilkins, a former Republican speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates and ALEC member, said in 2002, &quot;Just because business writes a bill doesn&#x27;t make it bad. We get bills from all angles. And we still have to debate the issue.&quot; Whisnant, ALEC&#x27;s Oregon co-chair, acknowledged in 2012 that corporations sometimes write model bills to promote their own interests and added, &quot;But that doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;ll support them.&quot; Harvey Morgan, another former Virginia delegate and ALEC member, said of ALEC conferences, &quot;You know before you go that the big-business view will prevail, and that&#x27;s not necessarily bad. I still would like them to be a little more objective.&quot;

Alan Rosenthal, a former Rutgers University political science professor and expert on state legislatures and lobbying, said in 2012, &quot;Legislators don&#x27;t sit down with a quill pen and draft legislation. I think legislators should have the right to turn to wherever they want to get the ideas they prefer... I have some confidence that they&#x27;re not being flimflammed.&quot;

Experts agree that, regardless of its propriety, the ALEC model has been very effective. &quot;Bloomberg Politics&quot; reported in 2014 that ALEC had &quot;no equal&quot; in accessing conservative policymakers. Rosenthal said of ALEC, &quot;You&#x27;ve had the interest groups having access and sitting on other task forces, but here you&#x27;ve really perfected it... You&#x27;ve not only got them gaining access and interacting with legislators but you have them shaping policy together. It seems to me that&#x27;s a pretty major advance.&quot; Edwin Bender, executive director of the nonpartisan OpenSecrets has said, &quot;What makes ALEC different is its effectiveness in not just bringing the people together but selling a piece of legislation that was written by the industry and for the industry and selling it as a piece of mainstream legislation.&quot;

=== Allegations of lobbying activity ===
In April 2012, Common Cause filed a complaint with the Internal Revenue Service objecting to ALEC&#x27;s tax status as a nonprofit organization and alleged that lobbying accounted for more than 60% of its expenditures. ALEC formally denied lobbying, although Delores Mertz, who had previously served as chairwoman of the ALEC board, said she was &quot;concerned about the lobbying that&#x27;s going on, especially with [ALEC&#x27;s] 501(c)3 status&quot;. Reporting on the allegations, &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; compared ALEC&#x27;s work to that of lobbyists, noting, &quot;part of ALEC&#x27;s mission is to present industry-backed legislation as grass-roots work,&quot; and that being a nonprofit rather than a lobby group allows deductibility of membership dues and freedom from disclosing the names of legislators who attend its educational seminars or the executives who give presentations to those legislators. William Schluter, vice chairman of the New Jersey Ethics Commission and a former Republican state senator, said of ALEC&#x27;s activities, &quot;When you get right down to it, this is not different from lobbying. It is lobbying. ...Any kind of large organization that adds to public policy or has initiatives involving public policy should be disclosed—not only their name, but who is backing them.&quot; According to &quot;Governing&quot; magazine, ALEC legislators often have their travel expenses paid as &quot;scholarships&quot; and are &quot;wined and dined and golf-coursed&quot; by private sector members. In July 2013, Common Cause submitted a supplemental brief to the IRS complaining about these practices.

ALEC responded to the original Common Cause complaint by denying it engaged in lobbying, while saying that liberal groups were attacking ALEC because &quot;they don&#x27;t have a comparable group that is as effective as ALEC in enacting policies into law.&quot; , the IRS investigation remained open.

Statutes in Colorado, South Carolina, and Indiana exempt ALEC, specifically by name, from having to register as a lobbyist and report lobbying expenditures. In 2013, ALEC created a 501(c)(4) organization called the &quot;Jeffersonian Project&quot; that, according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;would allow Alec to be far more overt in its lobbying activities than its current charitable status as a 501(c)(3)&quot;.

==Funding==
, corporation, think tank, and trade group members accounted for almost 99% of ALEC&#x27;s $7 million budget. Legislators pay $100 in biennial membership dues, or $50 per year, while non-legislators pay $7,000 to $25,000 to join, and more to participate in the task forces. In 2010, NPR reported that tax records showed that corporations had collectively paid as much as $6 million a year to ALEC. ALEC&#x27;s total revenue in 2011 was $9 million.

In 2010, ALEC received $100,000 each from AT&amp;T, Allergan, and RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company to be named as &quot;president level&quot; sponsors at its annual meeting. Eleven other members, including Pfizer (PFE) and the Institute for Legal Reform, paid $50,000 each to be named as &quot;chairman level&quot; sponsors. , Altria, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, and BP America were also $50,000 chairman level sponsors.

ExxonMobil&#x27;s foundation donated $30,000 to ALEC in both 2005 and 2006. Alan Jeffers, an ExxonMobil spokesman, said the company paid $39,000 in dues in 2010 and sponsored a reception at the annual meeting in San Diego for $25,000. In August 2011, Exxon spent $45,000 to sponsor a workshop on natural gas. According to the Center For Public Integrity, ALEC received $150,000 from Charles and David Koch in 2011. Greenpeace claims that ALEC has received $525,858 from Koch foundations between 2005 and 2011.

Corporate members also pay $3,000 to $10,000 for seats on task forces.

According to a December 2013 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, ALEC faced a funding shortfall after &quot;losing more than a third of its projected income&quot; when some 400 state legislators left its membership, along with more than 60 corporate donors. The organization&#x27;s 2013 tax return indicated a 13% drop in total revenue from $8.4 million to $7.3 million. On its 2016 tax return ALEC reported an increase in total revenue from $9.0 million the prior year to $10.3 million.

<text>In the United States, the state legislature is the legislative branch in each of the 50 U.S. states. 

A legislature generally performs state duties for a state in the same way that the United States Congress performs national duties at the national level. Generally, the same system of checks and balances that exists at the federal level also exists between the state legislature, the state executive officer (governor) and the state judiciary. 

In 27 states, the legislature is called the &quot;legislature&quot; or the &quot;state legislature&quot;, while in 19 states the legislature is called the &quot;general assembly&quot;. In Massachusetts and New Hampshire, the legislature is called the &quot;general court&quot;, while North Dakota and Oregon designate the legislature the &quot;legislative assembly&quot;.

== Legislature overview ==

=== Responsibilities ===
The responsibilities of a state legislature vary from state to state, depending on state&#x27;s constitution. 

The primary function of any legislature is to create laws. State legislatures also approve budget for state government. They may establish government agencies, set their policies, and approve their budgets. For instance, a state legislature could establish an agency to manage environmental conservation efforts within that state. In some states, state legislators elect other officials, such as governor.

State legislatures often have power to regulate businesses operating within their jurisdiction. They also regulate courts within their jurisdiction. This includes determining types of cases that can be heard, setting court fees, and regulating attorney conduct.

Other responsibilities

Under the terms of Article V of the U.S. Constitution, state lawmakers retain the power to ratify Constitutional amendments which have been proposed by both houses of Congress and they also retain the ability to call for a national convention to propose amendments to the U.S. Constitution.

After the convention has concluded its business 75% of the states will ratify what the convention has proposed. Under Article II, state legislatures choose the manner of appointing the state&#x27;s presidential electors. Formerly, state legislatures appointed the U.S. Senators from their respective states until the ratification of the 17th Amendment in 1913 required the direct election of senators by the state&#x27;s voters.

Sometimes what the legislature wishes to accomplish cannot be done simply by the passage of a bill, but rather requires amending the state constitution. Each state has specified steps intended to make it difficult to alter the constitution without the sufficient support of either the legislature, or the people, or both.

=== Organization ===
All states except Nebraska have a bicameral legislature. The smaller chamber is called the senate, usually referred to as the upper house. This chamber usually has the exclusive power to confirm appointments made by the governor and to try articles of impeachment. (In a few states, a separate executive council, composed of members elected from large districts, performs the confirmation function.)

Nebraska originally had a bicameral legislature like the other states, but the lower house was abolished following a referendum, effective with the 1936 elections. The remaining unicameral (one-chamber) legislature is called the Nebraska Legislature, but its members are called state senators.

====History====

The first bicameral American legislature was formed in 1619 as the Virginia House of Burgesses.

The legislatures of the initial Thirteen Colonies usually consisted of an elected lower house and an appointed upper house, the latter of which also functioned as an advisory council to the colonial governor. After the American Revolution and the establishment of the United States, most states wrote new constitutions which had direct elections for both chambers of the legislature. This model helped influence the U.S. Constitution and was then adopted by new states which later joined the union.

====Representation====
Members of the smaller chamber represent more citizens and usually serve for longer terms than members of the larger chamber, generally four years. In 41 states, the larger chamber is called the House of Representatives. Five states designate the larger chamber the assembly, three states call it the House of Delegates, and one has just one chamber. Members of the larger chamber usually serve for terms of two years. The larger chamber customarily has the exclusive power to initiate taxing legislation and articles of impeachment.

Prior to the United States Supreme Court decisions &quot;Baker v. Carr&quot; (1962) and &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot; (1964), the basis of representation in most state legislatures was modeled on that of the U.S. Congress: the state senators represented geographical units, while members of the larger chamber represented population. In &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot; the Supreme Court decided upon the one man, one vote standard for state legislatures and invalidated representation based on geographical units regardless of population. (The ruling does not affect the U.S. Senate, because that chamber&#x27;s makeup is prescribed by the U.S. Constitution.)

=== Sessions ===
During a legislative session, the legislature considers matters introduced by its members or submitted by the governor. Businesses and other special interest organizations often lobby the legislature to obtain beneficial legislation, defeat unfavorably perceived measures, or influence other legislative action. A legislature also approves the state&#x27;s operating and capital budgets, which may begin as a legislative proposal or a submission by the governor.

In most states, a new state legislature convenes in January of the odd-numbered year after the election of members to the larger chamber. The period during which the legislature remains in session varies by state. In states where the legislature is considered part-time, a session may last several months; where the legislature is considered full-time, the session may last all year, with periodic breaks for district work.

Some states have varying lengths for odd-numbered and even-numbered years, or allow for a fixed number of either legislative or calendar days. Georgia for example, allows only 40 legislative days per year, and Wyoming allows 60 legislative days per term and no more than 40 per one calendar year. Whereas in Michigan, New Jersey, New York (in odd-numbered years), Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin (in odd-numbered years), the sessions usually last all year.

Four state legislatures – Montana, Nevada, North Dakota and Texas – meet only biennially. In the early 1960s, only 19 legislatures met annually, but by the mid-1970s, it had increased to 41. The latest legislature to switch to annual sessions was Oregon in 2011, following a voter-approved ballot measure.

Many state legislators meet every year at the National Conference of The Council of State Governments (CSG), headquartered in Lexington, Kentucky, with offices in Washington, DC; New York City; Chicago; Atlanta; and Sacramento, and at the annual meetings of CSG&#x27;s regions, The Southern Legislative Conference, The Midwestern Legislative Conference, the Eastern Regional Conference and CSG West, and at the Legislative Summit of the National Conference of State Legislatures, which is headquartered in Denver, Colorado and has a lobbying office in Washington, D.C. 

Additionally, privately funded organizations with ideological leanings have annual meetings attracting many legislators. These include the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a conservative organization, and the State Innovation Exchange (SIX), its progressive counterpart.

=== Legislative Procedure ===

As of 2017, 24 of 99 chambers have limits on the number of bills that a legislator can introduce per year according to NCSL. Most limits are set by internal legislative rules, while Louisiana&#x27;s legislature is limited by constitutional amendment.
Generally, the legislative bodies and their committees use either &quot;Mason&#x27;s Manual of Legislative Procedure&quot; or an amended form thereof. During official meetings, a professional parliamentarian is available to ensure that legislation and accompanying discussion proceed as orderly as possible without bias.

Bill drafting and submission

The lawmaking process begins with the introduction of a bill in either the House of Representatives or the Senate. Bills may be introduced in either house, sometimes with the exception of bills increasing or decreasing revenue, which must originate in the House of Representatives. The order of business in each house provides a proper time for the introduction of bills.

Bills are usually assigned consecutive numbers, given in the order of their introduction, to facilitate identification. Usually a bill cannot become enacted until it has been read on a certain number of days in each house. Upon introduction, a bill is usually read by its title only, constituting the first reading of the bill. Because a bill is usually read by title only, it is important that the title give the members notice of the subject matter contained in the bill.

A 2013 study of state legislatures found that of the 99 studied, about half, 53, had roll rates below 5%. And most, 83, had roll rates below 10%.

When a bill passes where most votes are from the minority party and &quot;moderate&quot; members of a majority party, this is known as the majority being &quot;rolled&quot;. 
When there are bills which most of the majority oppose, roll rates are a measure of the majority party&#x27;s avoidance of voting on those bills.

Committee review

Committees review bill, often holding hearings to gather information and opinions, and can propose amendments to bill similar to legislative bodies throughout the world. Most bills cannot be enacted into law until it has been referred to, acted upon by, and returned from, a standing committee in each house. Reference to committee usually follows the first reading of the bill. 

Each committee is set up to consider bills relating to a particular subject. Standing committees are charged with the important responsibility of examining bills and recommending action to the Senate or House. Often on days when a legislature is not in session, the committees of each house meet and consider the bills that have been referred to them to decide if the assigned bills should be reported for further action.

For most bills, the recommendations of the committee are followed, although either house is free to accept or reject the action of the committee. Bills reported favorably by a committee may be placed on a regular calendar (the agenda of the deliberative body).

Most of the work of the legislature is done by committees. The legislature as a whole relies on its committees to report out only those bills deserving the consideration of the entire house.

Through standing committees, each bill is addressed by a group of members who have special knowledge of its subject. Some members of the legislature have expert knowledge of particular subjects of legislation, and these members are usually placed on committees to take full advantage of this specialized knowledge. For this reason, the legislature often accepts the final recommendations of its standing committees. As has been noted, however, the legislature does not completely abdicate its responsibility for the consideration of pending bills. If the need arises, the members of either house can force a committee to take action on a bill, or they can ignore the committee&#x27;s recommendations.

Pocket veto and discharge petitions

Pocket veto powers are common, which allows a committee to &quot;kill&quot; a bill, sometimes without even a public vote; in Colorado, the power was notably repealed in a citizen initiative constitutional amendment in 1988 driven by various reform groups.

When a committee refuses to vote a bill out of committee, a discharge petition can be passed by the broader membership. The specifics vary from state to state; for example, in 2004, a report found that New York State &quot;places more restrictions than any other state legislature on motions to discharge a bill from a committee&quot;, which led to subsequent reforms.

Reports of Committee

After a committee has completed work on a bill, it reports the bill to the appropriate house during the &quot;reports of committees&quot; in the daily order of business. Reported bills are immediately given a second reading. The houses do not vote on a bill at the time it is reported; however, reported bills are placed on the calendar for the next legislative day. This second reading is made by title only.

The regular calendar is a list of bills that have been favorably reported from committee and are ready for consideration by the membership of the entire house.

Third reading

Regardless of where a bill is placed on the calendar, once the bill is considered and adopted, this is called the third reading. At this third reading of the bill, the entire legislature gives consideration to its passage. At this time, the bill may be studied in detail, debated, amended, and read at length before final passage.

If the majority vote in favor of the bill, it is recorded as passed.

Transmission to second house

A bill that is passed in one house is transmitted, along with a formal message, to the other house. If the bill is not reported from committee or is not considered by the full house, the bill is defeated.

The house of origin, upon return of its amended bill, may take any one of several courses of action. It may concur in the amendment by the adoption of a motion to that effect; then the bill, having been passed by both houses in identical form, is ready for enrollment. Another possibility is that the house of origin may adopt a motion to non-concur in the amendment, at which point the bill dies. Finally, the house of origin may refuse to accept the amendment but request that a conference committee be appointed. The other house usually agrees to the request, and the presiding officer of each house appoints members to the conference committee.

Conference committees

A conference committee is often empaneled to discuss the points of difference between the two houses&#x27; versions of the same bill, and tries to reach an agreement between them so that the identical bill can be passed by both houses. If an agreement is reached and if both houses adopt the conference committee&#x27;s report, the bill is passed. If either house refuses to adopt the report of the conference committee, a motion may be made for further conference. If a conference committee is unable to reach an agreement, it may be discharged, and a new conference committee may be appointed. Some highly controversial bills may be referred to several different conference committees. If an agreement is never reached in conference prior to the end of the legislative session, the bill is lost.

When a bill has passed both houses in identical form, it is then ready for transmittal to the governor.

Governor&#x27;s Approval or Veto

The governor may sign bills presented by the legislature, which completes its enactment into law. From this point, the bill becomes an act, and remains the law of the state unless repealed by legislative action or overturned by a court decision. Governors who do not approve of the bill may veto it. In the event of a veto, the governor returns the bill to the house in which it originated with a message of objections and amendments (if applicable) which might remove those objections. The bill is then reconsidered, and if a simple majority of the members of both houses agrees to the proposed executive amendments, it is returned to the governor for signature.

On the other hand, a qualified majority (two-thirds) of the members of each house can choose to approve a vetoed bill precisely as the legislature originally passed it, in which case it becomes a law over the governor&#x27;s veto. If the governor fails to return a bill to the legislative house in which it originated within a specified number of days after it was presented, it becomes a law without their signature.

The bills that reach the governor less than a specified number of days before the end of the session may be approved within ten days after adjournment. The bills not approved within that time do not become law. This is known as a &quot;pocket veto&quot;. This is the most conclusive form of veto, for the legislature (having adjourned) has no chance to reconsider the vetoed measure.

<text>Brazoria County ( ) is a county in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2020 census, the population of the county was 372,031. The county seat is Angleton.

Brazoria County is included in the Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land metropolitan statistical area. It is located in the Gulf Coast region of Texas.

Regionally, parts of the county are within the extreme southernmost fringe of the regions locally known as Southeast Texas. Brazoria County is among a number of counties that are part of the region known as the Texas Coastal Bend. Its county seat is Angleton, and its largest city is Pearland. Brazoria County, like Brazos County farther upriver, takes its name from the Brazos River. It served as the first settlement area for Anglo-Texas, when the Old Three Hundred emigrated from the United States in 1821. The county also includes what was once Columbia and Velasco, Texas, early capital cities of the Republic of Texas. The highest point in Brazoria County is Shelton&#x27;s Shack, located near the Dow Chemical Plant B Truck Control Center, measuring 342 ft above sea level.

== History ==
Brazoria County takes its name from the Brazos River, which flows through it. Anglo-Texas began in Brazoria County when the first of Stephen F. Austin&#x27;s authorized 300 American settlers arrived at the mouth of the Brazos in 1821. Many of the events leading to the Texas Revolution developed in Brazoria County. In 1832, Brazoria was organized as a separate municipal district by the Mexican government, so became one of Texas original counties at independence in 1836.

An early resident of Brazoria County, Joel Walter Robison, fought in the Texas Revolution and later represented Fayette County in the Texas House of Representatives.

Stephen F. Austin&#x27;s original burial place is located at a church cemetery, Gulf Prairie Cemetery, in the town of Jones Creek, on what was his brother-in-law&#x27;s Peach Point Plantation. His remains were exhumed in 1910 and brought to be reinterred at the state capital in Austin. The town of West Columbia served as the first capital of Texas, dating back to prerevolutionary days.
The Hastings Oil Field was discovered by the Stanolind Oil and Gas Company in 1934. Production was from a depth of , associated with a salt dome structure. Total production by 1954 was about 242 million barrels.

Lake Jackson is a community developed beginning in the early 1940s to provide housing to workers at a new Dow Chemical Company plant in nearby Freeport. The county has elements of both rural and suburban communities, as it is part of greater Houston.
On June 2, 2016, the flooding of the Brazos River required evacuations for portions of Brazoria County.
