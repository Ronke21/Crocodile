<text>The carrying capacity of an environment is the maximum population size of a biological species that can be sustained by that specific environment, given the food, habitat, water, and other resources available. The carrying capacity is defined as the environment&#x27;s maximal load, which in population ecology corresponds to the population equilibrium, when the number of deaths in a population equals the number of births (as well as immigration and emigration). Carrying capacity of the environment implies that the resources extraction is not above the rate of regeneration of the resources and the wastes generated are within the assimilating capacity of the environment. The effect of carrying capacity on population dynamics is modelled with a logistic function. Carrying capacity is applied to the maximum population an environment can support in ecology, agriculture and fisheries. The term carrying capacity has been applied to a few different processes in the past before finally being applied to population limits in the 1950s. The notion of carrying capacity for humans is covered by the notion of sustainable population.

An early detailed examination of global limits was published in the 1972 book &quot;Limits to Growth&quot;, which has prompted follow-up commentary and analysis, including much criticism. A 2012 review in &quot;Nature&quot; by 22 international researchers expressed concerns that the Earth may be &quot;approaching a state shift&quot; in which the biosphere may become less hospitable to human life and in which human carrying capacity may diminish. This concern that humanity may be passing beyond &quot;tipping points&quot; for safe use of the biosphere has increased in subsequent years. Recent estimates of Earth&#x27;s carrying capacity run between two billion and four billion people, depending on how optimistic researchers are about international cooperation to solve collective action problems.

==Origins==
In terms of population dynamics, the term &#x27;carrying capacity&#x27; was not explicitly used in 1838 by the Belgian mathematician Pierre François Verhulst when he first published his equations based on research on modelling population growth.

The origins of the term &quot;carrying capacity&quot; are uncertain, with sources variously stating that it was originally used &quot;in the context of international shipping&quot; in the 1840s, or that it was first used during 19th-century laboratory experiments with micro-organisms. A 2008 review finds the first use of the term in English was an 1845 report by the US Secretary of State to the US Senate. It then became a term used generally in biology in the 1870s, being most developed in wildlife and livestock management in the early 1900s. It had become a staple term in ecology used to define the biological limits of a natural system related to population size in the 1950s.

Neo-Malthusians and eugenicists popularised the use of the words to describe the number of people the Earth can support in the 1950s, although American biostatisticians Raymond Pearl and Lowell Reed had already applied it in these terms to human populations in the 1920s.

Hadwen and Palmer (1923) defined carrying capacity as the density of stock that could be grazed for a definite period without damage to the range.

It was first used in the context of wildlife management by the American Aldo Leopold in 1933, and a year later by the American Paul Lester Errington, a wetlands specialist. They used the term in different ways, Leopold largely in the sense of grazing animals (differentiating between a &#x27;saturation level&#x27;, an intrinsic level of density a species would live in, and carrying capacity, the most animals which could be in the field) and Errington defining &#x27;carrying capacity&#x27; as the number of animals above which predation would become &#x27;heavy&#x27; (this definition has largely been rejected, including by Errington himself). The important and popular 1953 textbook on ecology by Eugene Odum, &quot;Fundamentals of Ecology&quot;, popularised the term in its modern meaning as the equilibrium value of the logistic model of population growth.

==Mathematics==
The specific reason why a population stops growing is known as a limiting or regulating factor.

The difference between the birth rate and the death rate is the natural increase. If the population of a given organism is below the carrying capacity of a given environment, this environment could support a positive natural increase; should it find itself above that threshold the population typically decreases. Thus, the carrying capacity is the maximum number of individuals of a species that an environment can support in long run.

Population size decreases above carrying capacity due to a range of factors depending on the species concerned, but can include insufficient space, food supply, or sunlight. The carrying capacity of an environment varies for different species.

In the standard ecological algebra as illustrated in the simplified Verhulst model of population dynamics, carrying capacity is represented by the constant formula_1:

: formula_2

where

* is the population size,
* is the intrinsic rate of natural increase
* is the carrying capacity of the local environment, and
* , the derivative of with respect to time , is the rate of change in population with time.

Thus, the equation relates the growth rate of the population to the current population size, incorporating the effect of the two constant parameters and . (Note that decrease is negative growth.) The choice of the letter came from the German &quot;Kapazitätsgrenze&quot; (capacity limit).

The Verhulst equation is a first-order ordinary differential equation. Combined with an initial value formula_3 for the population at time formula_4, the solution takes the form of the logistic growth curve:

: formula_5

where

* is Euler&#x27;s number,
* is a constant determined by the initial population formula_6 via formula_7. When the initial population is below the carrying capacity, formula_8 is positive; when it is above, formula_8 is negative.
* is the initial exponential growth rate, and
* is the carrying capacity.

The logistic growth curve depicts how population growth rate and carrying capacity are inter-connected. As illustrated in the logistic growth curve model, when the population size is small, the population increases exponentially. However, as population size nears carrying capacity, the growth decreases and reaches zero at .

What determines a specific system&#x27;s carrying capacity involves a limiting factor; this may be available supplies of food or water, nesting areas, space, or the amount of waste that can be absorbed without degrading the environment and decreasing carrying capacity.

==Population ecology ==
Carrying capacity is a commonly used concept for biologists when trying to better understand biological populations and the factors which affect them. When addressing biological populations, carrying capacity can be seen as a stable dynamic equilibrium, taking into account extinction and colonization rates. In population biology, logistic growth assumes that population size fluctuates above and below an equilibrium value.

Numerous authors have questioned the usefulness of the term when applied to actual wild populations. Although useful in theory and in laboratory experiments, carrying capacity as a method of measuring population limits in the environment is less useful as it sometimes oversimplifies the interactions between species.

==Agriculture==
It is important for farmers to calculate the carrying capacity of their land so they can establish a sustainable stocking rate. For example, calculating the carrying capacity of a paddock in Australia is done in Dry Sheep Equivalents (DSEs). A single DSE is 50 kg Merino wether, dry ewe or non-pregnant ewe, which is maintained in a stable condition. Not only sheep are calculated in DSEs, the carrying capacity for other livestock is also calculated using this measure. A 200 kg weaned calf of a British style breed gaining 0.25 kg/day is 5.5DSE, but if the same weight of the same type of calf were gaining 0.75 kg/day, it would be measured at 8DSE. Cattle are not all the same, their DSEs can vary depending on breed, growth rates, weights, if it is a cow (&#x27;dam&#x27;), steer or ox (&#x27;bullock&#x27; in Australia), and if it weaning, pregnant or &#x27;wet&#x27; (i.e. lactating).

In other parts of the world different units are used for calculating carrying capacities. In the United Kingdom the paddock is measured in LU, livestock units, although different schemes exist for this. New Zealand uses either LU, EE (ewe equivalents) or SU (stock units). In the US and Canada the traditional system uses animal units (AU). A French/Swiss unit is &quot;Unité de Gros Bétail&quot; (UGB).
In some European countries such as Switzerland the pasture (&quot;alm&quot; or &quot;alp&quot;) is traditionally measured in &quot;Stoß&quot;, with one &quot;Stoß&quot; equaling four &quot;Füße&quot; (feet). A more modern European system is &quot;Großvieheinheit&quot; (GV or GVE), corresponding to 500 kg in liveweight of cattle. In extensive agriculture 2 GV/ha is a common stocking rate, in intensive agriculture, when grazing is supplemented with extra fodder, rates can be 5 to 10 GV/ha. In Europe average stocking rates vary depending on the country, in 2000 the Netherlands and Belgium had a very high rate of 3.82 GV/ha and 3.19 GV/ha respectively, surrounding countries have rates of around 1 to 1.5 GV/ha, and more southern European countries have lower rates, with Spain having the lowest rate of 0.44 GV/ha.

This system can also be applied to natural areas. Grazing megaherbivores at roughly 1 GV/ha is considered sustainable in central European grasslands, although this varies widely depending on many factors. In ecology it is theoretically (i.e. cyclic succession, patch dynamics, &quot;Megaherbivorenhypothese&quot;) taken that a grazing pressure of 0.3 GV/ha by wildlife is enough to hinder afforestation in a natural area. Because different species have different ecological niches, with horses for example grazing short grass, cattle longer grass, and goats or deer preferring to browse shrubs, niche differentiation allows a terrain to have slightly higher carrying capacity for a mixed group of species, than it would if there were only one species involved.

Some niche market schemes mandate lower stocking rates than can maximally be grazed on a pasture. In order to market ones&#x27; meat products as &#x27;biodynamic&#x27;, a lower &quot;Großvieheinheit&quot; of 1 to 1.5 (2.0) GV/ha is mandated, with some farms having an operating structure using only 0.5 to 0.8 GV/ha.

The Food and Agriculture Organization has introduced three international units to measure carrying capacity: FAO Livestock Units for North America, FAO Livestock Units for sub-Saharan Africa, and Tropical Livestock Units.

Another rougher and less precise method of determining the carrying capacity of a paddock is simply by looking objectively at the condition of the herd. In Australia, the national standardized system for rating livestock conditions is done by body condition scoring (BCS). An animal in a very poor condition is scored with a BCS of 0, and an animal which is extremely healthy is scored at 5: animals may be scored between these two numbers in increments of 0.25. At least 25 animals of the same type must be scored to provide a statistically representative number, and scoring must take place monthly -if the average falls, this may be due to a stocking rate above the paddock&#x27;s carrying capacity or too little fodder. This method is less direct for determining stocking rates than looking at the pasture itself, because the changes in the condition of the stock may lag behind changes in the condition of the pasture.

==Fisheries==
In fisheries, carrying capacity is used in the formulae to calculate sustainable yields for fisheries management. The maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is defined as &quot;the highest average catch that can be continuously taken from an exploited population (=stock) under average environmental conditions&quot;. MSY was originally calculated as half of the carrying capacity, but has been refined over the years, now being seen as roughly 30% of the population, depending on the species or population. Because the population of a species which is brought below its carrying capacity due to fishing will find itself in the exponential phase of growth, as seen in the Verhulst model, the harvesting of an amount of fish at or below MSY is a surplus yield which can be sustainably harvested without reducing population size at equilibrium, keeping the population at its maximum recruitment. However, annual fishing can be seen as a modification of &quot;r&quot; in the equation -i.e. the environment has been modified, which means that the population size at equilibrium with annual fishing is slightly below what &quot;K&quot; would be without it.

Note that mathematically and in practical terms, MSY is problematic. If mistakes are made and even a tiny amount of fish are harvested each year above the MSY, populations dynamics imply that the total population will eventually decrease to zero. The actual carrying capacity of the environment may fluctuate in the real world, which means that practically, MSY may actually vary from year to year (annual sustainable yields and maximum average yield attempt to take this into account). Other similar concepts are optimum sustainable yield and maximum economic yield; these are both harvest rates below MSY.

These calculations are used to determine fishing quotas.

== Humans ==

Human carrying capacity is a function of how people live and the technology at their disposal. The two great economic revolutions that marked human history up to 1900—the agricultural and industrial revolutions—greatly increased the Earth&#x27;s human carrying capacity, allowing human population to grow from 5 to 10 million people in 10,000 BCE to 1.5 billion in 1900. The immense technological improvements of the past 100 years—in applied chemistry, physics, computing, genetic engineering, and more—have further increased Earth&#x27;s human carrying capacity, at least in the short term. Without the Haber-Bosch process for fixing nitrogen, modern agriculture could not support 8 billion people. Without the Green Revolution of the 1950s and 60s, famine might have culled large numbers of people in poorer countries during the last three decades of the twentieth century.

Recent technological successes, however, have come at grave environmental costs. Climate change, ocean acidification, and the huge dead zones at the mouths of many of world&#x27;s great rivers, are a function of the scale of contemporary agriculture and the many other demands 8 billion people make on the planet. Scientists now speak of humanity exceeding or threatening to exceed 9 planetary boundaries for safe use of the biosphere. Humanity&#x27;s unprecedented ecological impacts threaten to degrade the ecosystem services that people and the rest of life depend on—potentially decreasing Earth&#x27;s human carrying capacity. The signs that we have crossed this threshold are increasing.  

The fact that degrading Earth&#x27;s essential services is obviously possible, and happening in some cases, suggests that 8 billion people may be above Earth&#x27;s human carrying capacity. But human carrying capacity is always a function of a certain number of people living a certain way. This was encapsulated by Paul Ehrlich and James Holdren&#x27;s (1972) IPAT equation: environmental impact (I) = population (P) x affluence (A) x the technologies used to accommodate human demands (T). IPAT has found spectacular confirmation in recent decades within climate science, where the Kaya identity for explaining changes in emissions is essentially IPAT with two technology factors broken out for ease of use.

This suggests to technological optimists that new technological discoveries (or the deployment of existing ones) could continue to increase Earth&#x27;s human carrying capacity, as it has in the past. Yet technology has unexpected side effects, as we have seen with stratospheric ozone depletion, excessive nitrogen deposition in the world&#x27;s rivers and bays, and global climate change. This suggests that 8 billion people may be sustainable for a few generations, but not over the long term, and the term ‘carrying capacity’ implies a population that is sustainable indefinitely. It is possible, too, that efforts to anticipate and manage the impacts of powerful new technologies, or to divide up the efforts needed to keep global ecological impacts within sustainable bounds among more than 200 nations all pursuing their own self-interest, may prove too complicated to achieve over the long haul.

One issue with applying carrying capacity to any species is that ecosystems are not constant and change over time, therefore changing the resources available. Research has shown that sometimes the presence of human populations can increase local biodiversity, demonstrating that human habitation does not always lead to deforestation and decreased biodiversity. Another issue to consider when applying carrying capacity, especially to humans, is that measuring food resources is arbitrary. This is due to choosing what to consider (e.g., whether or not to include plants that are not available every year), how to classify what is considered (e.g., classifying edible plants that are not usually eaten as food resources or not), and determining if caloric values or nutritional values are privileged. Additional layers to this for humans are their cultural differences in taste (e.g., some consume flying termites) and individual choices on what to invest their labor into (e.g., fishing vs. farming), both of which vary over time. This leads to the need to determine whether or not to include all food resources or only those the population considered will consume. Carrying capacity measurements over large areas also assumes homogeneity in the resources available but this does not account for how resources and access to them can greatly vary within regions and populations. They also assume that the populations in the region only rely on that region’s resources even though humans exchange resources with others from other regions and there are few, if any, isolated populations. Variations in standards of living which directly impact resource consumption are also not taken into account. These issues show that while there are limits to resources, a more complex model of how humans interact with their ecosystem needs to be used to understand them.

== Recent warnings that humanity may have exceeded Earth&#x27;s carrying capacity ==
Between 1900 and 2020, Earth&#x27;s human population increased from 1.6 billion to 7.8 billion (a 390% increase). These successes greatly increased human resource demands, generating significant environmental degradation.

=== Millennium ecosystem assessment ===
The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) of 2005 was a massive, collaborative effort to assess the state of Earth&#x27;s ecosystems, involving more than 1,300 experts worldwide. Their first two of four main findings were the following. The first finding is:Over the past 50 years, humans have changed ecosystems more rapidly and extensively than in any comparable period of time in human history, largely to meet rapidly growing demands for food, fresh water, timber, fiber, and fuel. This has resulted in a substantial and largely irreversible loss in the diversity of life on Earth.The second of the four main findings is:The changes that have been made to ecosystems have contributed to substantial net gains in human well-being and economic development, but these gains have been achieved at growing costs in the form of the degradation of many ecosystem services, increased risks of nonlinear changes, and the exacerbation of poverty for some groups of people. These problems, unless addressed, will substantially diminish the benefits that future generations obtain from ecosystems.According to the MEA, these unprecedented environmental changes threaten to reduce the Earth&#x27;s long-term human carrying capacity. “The degradation of ecosystem services could grow significantly worse during the first half of this [21st] century,” they write, serving as a barrier to improving the lives of poor people around the world.

=== Critiques of Carrying Capacity with Relation to Humans ===
Humans and human culture itself are highly adaptable things that have overcome issues that seemed incomprehensible at the time before. It is not to say that carrying capacity is not something that should be considered and thought about, but it should be taken with some skepticism when presented as a concretely evidenced proof of something. Many biologists, ecologists, and social scientists have disposed of the term altogether due to the generalizations that are made that gloss over the complexity of interactions that take place on the micro and macro level. Carrying capacity in a human environment is subject to change at any time due to the highly adaptable nature of human society and culture. If resources, time, and energy are put into an issue, there very well may be a solution that exposes itself. This also should not be used as an excuse to overexploit or take advantage of the land or resources that are available. Nonetheless, it is possible to not be pessimistic as technological, social, and institutional adaptions could be accelerated, especially in a time of need, to solve problems, or in this case, increase carrying capacity. There are also of course resources on this Earth that are limited that most certainly will run out if overused or used without proper oversight/checks and balances. If things are left without remaining checked then overconsumption and exploitation of land and resources is likely to occur.

=== Ecological footprint accounting ===
Ecological Footprint accounting measures the demands people make on nature and compares them to available supplies, for both individual countries and the world as a whole. Developed originally by Mathis Wackernagel and William Rees, it has been refined and applied in a variety of contexts over the years by Global Footprint Network (GFN). On the demand side, the Ecological Footprint measures how fast a population uses resources and generates wastes, with a focus on five main areas: carbon emissions (or carbon footprint), land devoted to direct settlement, timber and paper use, food and fiber use, and seafood consumption. It converts these into per capita or total hectares used. On the supply side, national or global biocapacity represents the productivity of ecological assets in a particular nation or the world as a whole; this includes “cropland, grazing land, forest land, fishing grounds, and built-up land.” Again the various metrics to capture biocapacity are translated into the single term of hectares of available land. As Global Footprint Network (GFN) states:Each city, state or nation’s Ecological Footprint can be compared to its biocapacity, or that of the world. If a population’s Ecological Footprint exceeds the region’s biocapacity, that region runs a biocapacity deficit. Its demand for the goods and services that its land and seas can provide—fruits and vegetables, meat, fish, wood, cotton for clothing, and carbon dioxide absorption—exceeds what the region’s ecosystems can regenerate. In more popular communications, this is called “an ecological deficit.” A region in ecological deficit meets demand by importing, liquidating its own ecological assets (such as overfishing), and/or emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. If a region’s biocapacity exceeds its Ecological Footprint, it has a biocapacity reserve.According to the GFN&#x27;s calculations, humanity has been using resources and generating wastes in excess of sustainability since approximately 1970: currently humanity use Earth&#x27;s resources at approximately 170% of capacity. This implies that humanity is well over Earth&#x27;s human carrying capacity for our current levels of affluence and technology use. According to Global Footprint Network:In 2024, [Earth Overshoot Day] fell on August 1. Earth Overshoot Day marks the date when humanity has exhausted nature’s budget for the year. For the rest of the year, we are maintaining our ecological deficit by drawing down local resource stocks and accumulating carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. We are operating in overshoot.The concept of ‘ecological overshoot’ can be seen as equivalent to exceeding human carrying capacity. According to the most recent calculations from Global Footprint Network, most of the world&#x27;s residents live in countries in ecological overshoot (see the map on the right). 
This includes countries with dense populations (such as China, India, and the Philippines), countries with high per capita consumption and resource use (France, Germany, and Saudi Arabia), and countries with both high per capita consumption and large numbers of people (Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States).

=== Planetary Boundaries Framework ===
According to its developers, the planetary boundaries framework defines “a safe operating space for humanity based on the intrinsic biophysical processes that regulate the stability of the Earth system.” Human civilization has evolved in the relative stability of the Holocene epoch; crossing planetary boundaries for safe levels of atmospheric carbon, ocean acidity, or one of the other stated boundaries could send the global ecosystem spiraling into novel conditions that are less hospitable to life—possibly reducing global human carrying capacity. This framework, developed in an article published in 2009 in &quot;Nature&quot; and then updated in two articles published in 2015 in &quot;Science&quot; and in 2018 in &quot;PNAS&quot;,  identifies nine stressors of planetary support systems that need to stay within critical limits to preserve stable and safe biospheric conditions (see figure below). Climate change and biodiversity loss are seen as especially crucial, since on their own, they could push the Earth system out of the Holocene state: “transitions between time periods in Earth history have often been delineated by substantial shifts in climate, the biosphere, or both.” 

The scientific consensus is that humanity has exceeded three to five of the nine planetary boundaries for safe use of the biosphere and is pressing hard on several more. By itself, crossing one of the planetary boundaries does not prove humanity has exceeded Earth&#x27;s human carrying capacity; perhaps technological improvements or clever management might reduce this stressor and bring us back within the biosphere&#x27;s safe operating space. But when several boundaries are crossed, it becomes harder to argue that carrying capacity has not been breached. Because fewer people helps reduce all nine planetary stressors, the more boundaries are crossed, the clearer it appears that reducing human numbers is part of what is needed to get back within a safe operating space. Population growth regularly tops the list of causes of humanity&#x27;s increasing impact on the natural environment in Earth system science literature. Recently, planetary boundaries developer Will Steffen and co-authors ranked global population change as the leading indicator of the influence of socio-economic trends on the functioning of the Earth system in the modern era, post-1750.

<text>Vardar Macedonia (Macedonian and ) is a historical term referring to the central part of the broader Macedonian region, roughly corresponding to present-day North Macedonia. The name derives from the Vardar River and is primarily associated with the period of Serbian (1912–1918) and later Yugoslav rule (1918–1991).

==History==
Vardar Macedonia refers to the central part of the broader Macedonian region, which became part of the Kingdom of Serbia following the Balkan Wars (1912–1913) and was formally assigned to Serbia by the Treaty of Bucharest. It was named after the Vardar River, distinguishing it from Aegean Macedonia in Greece and Pirin Macedonia in Bulgaria.

The region was initially known as Serbian Macedonia although the use of the name &quot;Macedonia&quot; was prohibited later in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, due to the implemented policy of Serbianisation of the local Slavic-speakers. From 1919 to 1922, the area (including parts of today Kosovo and Eastern Serbia) was part of South Serbia (, &quot;Južna Srbija&quot;), 
In 1929, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was divided into provinces called &quot;banovinas&quot;. Vardar Macedonia as part of South Serbia then became part of Vardar Banovina.

During World War I it was occupied by Bulgaria as part of the Military Inspection Area of Macedonia. After the war the present-day Strumica and Novo Selo municipalities were broken away from Bulgaria and ceded to Yugoslavia. During the Second World War, Bulgaria established two administrative districts in the region – Bitola and Skopje. In 1946, most of Vardar Macedonia as one of the six constituent countries of SFR Yugoslavia became the People&#x27;s Republic of Macedonia (1946–1963), which was later renamed to Socialist Republic of Macedonia (1963–1991). Before the independence of the Republic of Macedonia, the region was also called Yugoslav Macedonia.

After the breakup of Yugoslavia, besides North Macedonia, the region encompasses also Trgovište and Preševo municipalities in Central Serbia, as well the Elez Han municipality in Kosovo.

<doc id="47548" wikidata="Q36669" url="?curid=47548" title="Daylight saving time">
<text>Daylight saving time (DST), also referred to as daylight saving(s), daylight savings time, daylight time (United States and Canada), or summer time (United Kingdom, European Union, and others), is the practice of advancing clocks to make better use of the longer daylight available during summer so that darkness falls at a later clock time. The typical implementation of DST is to set clocks forward by one hour in spring or late winter, and to set clocks back by one hour to standard time in the autumn (or &quot;fall&quot; in North American English, hence the mnemonic: &quot;spring forward and fall back&quot;).

== Overview ==
Around 34 percent of the world&#x27;s countries use DST. Some countries observe it only in some regions. In Canada, all of Yukon, most of Saskatchewan, and parts of Nunavut, Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec do not observe DST. It is observed by four Australian states and one territory. In the United States, it is observed by all states except Hawaii and Arizona (within the latter, however, the Navajo Nation does observe it).

Historically, several ancient societies adopted seasonal changes to their timekeeping to make better use of daylight; Roman timekeeping even included changes to water clocks to accommodate this. However, these were changes to the time divisions of the day rather than setting the whole clock forward. In a satirical letter to the editor of the &quot;Journal de Paris&quot; in 1784, Benjamin Franklin suggested that if Parisians could only wake up earlier in the summer they would economize on candle and oil usage, but he did not propose changing the clocks. In 1895, New Zealand entomologist and astronomer George Hudson made the first realistic proposal to change clocks by two hours every spring to the Wellington Philosophical Society, but this was not implemented until 1928 and in another form. In 1907, William Willett proposed the adoption of British Summer Time as a way to save energy; although seriously considered by Parliament, it was not implemented until 1916.

The first implementation of DST was by Port Arthur (today merged into Thunder Bay), in Ontario, Canada, in 1908, but only locally, not nationally. The first nation-wide implementations were by the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires, both starting on 30 April 1916. Since then, many countries have adopted DST at various times, particularly since the 1970s energy crisis.

==Rationale==
Industrialized societies usually follow a clock-based schedule for daily activities that do not change throughout the course of the year. The time of day that individuals begin and end work or school, and the coordination of mass transit, for example, usually remain constant year-round. In contrast, an agrarian society&#x27;s daily routines for work and personal conduct are more likely governed by the length of daylight hours and by solar time, which change seasonally because of the Earth&#x27;s axial tilt. North and south of the tropics, daylight lasts longer in that hemisphere&#x27;s summer and is shorter in that hemisphere&#x27;s winter, with the effect becoming greater the farther one moves away from the equator. DST is of little use for locations near the Equator, because these regions see only a small variation in daylight over the course of the year.

After synchronously resetting all clocks in a region to one hour ahead of standard time in spring in anticipation of longer daylight hours, individuals following a clock-based schedule will be awakened an hour earlier in the solar day than they would have otherwise. They will begin and complete daily work routines an hour earlier; in most cases, they will have an extra hour of daylight available to them after their workday activities.

The clock shift is partly motivated by practicality. At the summer solstice, in American temperate latitudes, for example, the sun rises around 4:30 standard time and sets around 19:30. Since most people are asleep at 04:30, it is seen as practical to treat 04:30 as if it were 05:30, thereby allowing people to wake closer to the sunrise and be active in the evening light, as the sun under DST sets an hour later (20:30). The longer evening daylight hours are attractive to golfers, for example, while farmers traditionally expressed dislike for having to be out working while dew is still heavy.

Proponents of daylight saving time argue that most people prefer more daylight hours after the typical &quot;nine to five&quot; workday. Supporters have also argued that DST decreases energy consumption by reducing the need for lighting and heating, but the actual effect on overall energy use is heavily disputed. For evaluation, it is required to go beyond considering only energy demand for lighting and also consider the energy used for heating or cooling buildings.

===Variation within a time zone===
The effect of daylight saving time also varies according to how far east or west the location is within its time zone, with locations farther east inside the time zone benefiting more from DST than locations farther west in the same time zone. In spite of a width spanning thousands of kilometers, all of China is located within a single time zone per government mandate, minimizing any potential benefit of daylight saving time there.

==History==
Ancient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than DST does, often dividing daylight into 12 hours regardless of daytime, so that each daylight hour became progressively longer during spring and shorter during autumn. For example, the Romans kept time with water clocks that had different scales for different months of the year; at Rome&#x27;s latitude, the third hour from sunrise (&quot;hora tertia&quot;) started at 09:02 solar time and lasted 44 minutes at the winter solstice, but at the summer solstice it started at 06:58 and lasted 75 minutes. From the 14th century onward, equal-length civil hours supplanted unequal ones, so civil time no longer varied by season. Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings, such as monasteries of Mount Athos and in Jewish ceremonies.

Benjamin Franklin published the proverb &quot;early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise&quot;, and published a letter in the &quot;Journal de Paris&quot; when he was an American envoy to France (1776–1785) suggesting that Parisians economize on candles by rising earlier to use morning sunlight. This 1784 satire proposed taxing window shutters, rationing candles, and waking the public by ringing church bells and firing cannons at sunrise. Despite common misconception, Franklin did not actually propose DST; 18th-century Europe did not even keep precise schedules. However, this changed as rail transport and communication networks required a standardization of clocks unknown in Franklin&#x27;s day.

In 1810, the Spanish National Assembly Cortes of Cádiz issued a regulation that moved certain meeting times forward by one hour from 1 May to 30 September in recognition of seasonal changes, but it did not change the clocks. It also acknowledged that private businesses were in the practice of changing their opening hours to suit daylight conditions, but they did so of their volition.

New Zealand entomologist George Hudson first proposed modern DST. His shift-work job gave him spare time to collect insects and led him to value after-hours daylight. In 1895, he presented a paper to the Wellington Philosophical Society proposing a two-hour daylight-saving shift, and considerable interest was expressed in Christchurch; he followed up with an 1898 paper. Many publications credit the DST proposal to prominent English builder and outdoorsman William Willett, who independently conceived DST in 1907 during a pre-breakfast ride when he observed how many Londoners slept through a large part of a summer day. Willett also was an avid golfer who disliked cutting short his round at dusk. His solution was to advance the clock during the summer, and he published the proposal two years later. Liberal Party member of parliament Robert Pearce took up the proposal, introducing the first Daylight Saving Bill to the British House of Commons on 12 February 1908. A select committee was set up to examine the issue, but Pearce&#x27;s bill did not become law and several other bills failed in the following years. Willett lobbied for the proposal in the UK until his death in 1915.
Port Arthur, Ontario, Canada, was the first city in the world to enact DST, on 1 July 1908. This was followed by Orillia, Ontario, introduced by William Sword Frost while mayor from 1911 to 1912. The first states to adopt DST () nationally were those of the German Empire and its World War I ally Austria-Hungary commencing on 30 April 1916, as a way to conserve coal during wartime. Britain, most of its allies, and many European neutrals soon followed. Russia and a few other countries waited until the next year, and the United States adopted daylight saving in 1918. Most jurisdictions abandoned DST in the years after the war ended in 1918, with exceptions including Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, and the United States. It became common during World War II (some countries adopted double summer time), and was standardized in the US by federal law in 1966, and widely adopted in Europe from the 1970s as a result of the 1970s energy crisis. Since then, the world has seen many enactments, adjustments, and repeals.

It is a common myth in the United States that DST was first implemented for the benefit of farmers. In reality, farmers have been one of the strongest lobbying groups against DST since it was first implemented. The factors that influence farming schedules, such as morning dew and dairy cattle&#x27;s readiness to be milked, are ultimately dictated by the sun, so the clock change introduces unnecessary challenges.

DST was first implemented in the US with the Standard Time Act of 1918, a wartime measure for seven months during World War I in the interest of adding more daylight hours to conserve energy resources. Year-round DST, or &quot;War Time&quot;, was implemented again during World War II. After the war, local jurisdictions were free to choose if and when to observe DST until the Uniform Time Act which standardized DST in 1966. Permanent daylight saving time was enacted for the winter of 1974, but there were complaints of children going to school in the dark and working people commuting and starting their work day in pitch darkness during the winter, and it was repealed a year later.

Year-round daylight time has been adopted by the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, except Lloydminster and area.

==Procedure==

The relevant authorities usually schedule clock changes to occur at (or soon after) midnight and on a weekend, in order to lessen disruption to weekday schedules. A one-hour change is usual, but twenty-minute and two-hour changes have been used in the past. Notable exceptions today include Lord Howe Island with a thirty-minute change, and Troll (research station) that shifts two hours directly between CEST and GMT since 2016.
In all countries that observe daylight saving time seasonally (i.e., during summer and not winter), the clock is advanced from standard time to daylight saving time in the spring, and it is turned back from daylight saving time to standard time in the autumn. 

For a midnight change in spring, a digital display of local time would appear to jump from 23:59:59.9 to 01:00:00.0. For the same clock in autumn, the local time would appear to repeat the hour preceding midnight, i.e. it would jump from 23:59:59.9 to 23:00:00.0.

In most countries that observe seasonal daylight saving time, clocks revert in winter to &quot;standard time&quot;. An exception exists in Ireland, where its winter clock has the same offset (UTC+00:00) and legal name as that in Britain (Greenwich Mean Time)—but while its summer clock also has the same offset as Britain&#x27;s (UTC+01:00), its legal name is confusingly called Irish &quot;Standard&quot; Time as opposed to British Summer Time.

Since 2019, Morocco observes daylight saving time every month but Ramadan. During the holy month (the date of which is determined by the lunar calendar and thus moves annually with regard to the Gregorian calendar), the country&#x27;s civil clocks observe Western European Time (UTC+00:00, which geographically overlaps most of the nation). At the close of that month, its clocks are turned forward to Western European Summer Time (UTC+01:00).

The time at which to change clocks differs across jurisdictions. Members of the European Union conduct a coordinated change, changing all zones at the same instant, at 01:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which means that it changes at 02:00 Central European Time (CET), equivalent to 03:00 Eastern European Time (EET). As a result, the time differences across European time zones remain constant. North America coordination of the clock change differs, in that each jurisdiction changes at each local clock&#x27;s 02:00, which temporarily creates an imbalance with the next time zone (until it adjusts its clock, one hour later, at 2 am there). For example, Mountain Time is for one hour in the spring two hours ahead of Pacific Time instead of the usual one hour ahead, and instead of one hour in the autumn, briefly zero hours ahead of Pacific Time.

The dates on which clocks change vary with location and year; consequently, the time differences between regions also vary throughout the year. For example, Paris (which uses Central European Time) is usually six hours ahead of New York City (which uses North American Eastern Time), except for a few weeks in March and October/November when it is five hours ahead. Paris and Santiago are six hours apart during the northern summer, four hours during the southern summer, and five hours for a few weeks per year. Since 1996, European Summer Time has been observed from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October; previously the rules were not uniform across the European Union. Starting in 2007, most of the United States and Canada observed DST from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November, almost two-thirds of the year. Moreover, the beginning and ending dates are roughly reversed between the northern and southern hemispheres because spring and autumn are displaced six months. For example, mainland Chile observes DST from the second Saturday in October to the second Saturday in March, with transitions at the local clock&#x27;s 24:00. In some countries, clocks are governed by regional jurisdictions within the country such that some jurisdictions change and others do not; this is currently the case in Australia, Canada, and the United States.

From year to year, the dates on which to change clock may also move for political or social reasons. The Uniform Time Act of 1966 formalized the United States&#x27; period of daylight saving time observation as lasting six months (it was previously declared locally); this period was extended to seven months in 1986, and then to eight months in 2005. The 2005 extension was motivated in part by lobbyists from the candy industry, seeking to increase profits by including Halloween (31 October) within the daylight saving time period. In recent history, Australian state jurisdictions not only changed at different local times but sometimes on different dates. For example, in 2008 most states there that observed daylight saving time changed clocks forward on 5 October, but Western Australia changed on 26 October.

== Politics, religion and sport ==
The concept of daylight saving has caused controversy since its early proposals. Winston Churchill argued that it enlarges &quot;the opportunities for the pursuit of health and happiness among the millions of people who live in this country&quot; and pundits have dubbed it &quot;Daylight Slaving Time&quot;. Retailing, sports, and tourism interests have historically favored daylight saving, while agricultural and evening-entertainment interests (and some religious groups) have opposed it; energy crises and war prompted its initial adoption.

Willett&#x27;s 1907 proposal illustrates several political issues. It attracted many supporters, including Arthur Balfour, Churchill, David Lloyd George, Ramsay MacDonald, King Edward VII (who used half-hour DST or &quot;Sandringham time&quot; at Sandringham), the managing director of Harrods, and the manager of the National Bank Ltd. However, the opposition proved stronger, including Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, William Christie (the Astronomer Royal), George Darwin, Napier Shaw (director of the Meteorological Office), many agricultural organizations, and theatre-owners. After many hearings, a parliamentary committee vote narrowly rejected the proposal in 1909. Willett&#x27;s allies introduced similar bills every year from 1911 through 1914, to no avail. People in the US demonstrated even more skepticism; Andrew Peters introduced a DST bill to the House of Representatives in May 1909, but it soon died in committee.

Germany and its allies led the way in introducing DST during World War I on 30 April 1916, aiming to alleviate hardships due to wartime coal shortages and air-raid blackouts. The political equation changed in other countries; the United Kingdom used DST first on 21 May 1916. US retailing and manufacturing interests—led by Pittsburgh industrialist Robert Garland—soon began lobbying for DST, but railroads opposed the idea. The US&#x27; 1917 entry into the war overcame objections, and DST started in 1918.

The end of World War I brought a change in DST use. Farmers continued to dislike DST, and many countries repealed it—like Germany itself, which dropped DST from 1919 to 1939 and from 1950 to 1979. Britain proved an exception; it retained DST nationwide but adjusted transition dates over the years for several reasons, including special rules during the 1920s and 1930s to avoid clock shifts on Easter mornings. , summer time began annually on the last Sunday in March under a European Community directive, which may be Easter Sunday (as in 2016). In the US, Congress repealed DST after 1919. President Woodrow Wilson—an avid golfer like Willett—vetoed the repeal twice, but his second veto was overridden. Only a few US cities retained DST locally, including New York (so that its financial exchanges could maintain an hour of arbitrage trading with London), and Chicago and Cleveland (to keep pace with New York). Wilson&#x27;s successor as president, Warren G. Harding, opposed DST as a &quot;deception&quot;, reasoning that people should instead get up and go to work earlier in the summer. He ordered District of Columbia federal employees to start work at 8 am rather than 9 am during the summer of 1922. Some businesses followed suit, though many others did not; the experiment was not repeated.

Since Germany&#x27;s adoption of DST in 1916, the world has seen many enactments, adjustments, and repeals of DST, with similar politics involved. The history of time in the United States features DST during both world wars, but no standardization of peacetime DST until 1966. St. Paul and Minneapolis, Minnesota, kept different clocks for two weeks in May 1965: the capital city decided to switch to daylight saving time, while Minneapolis opted to follow the later date set by state law. In the mid-1980s, Clorox and 7-Eleven provided the primary funding for the Daylight Saving Time Coalition behind the 1987 extension to US DST. Both senators from Idaho, Larry Craig and Mike Crapo, voted for it based on the premise that fast-food restaurants sell more French fries (made from Idaho potatoes) during DST.

A referendum on the introduction of daylight saving took place in Queensland, Australia, in 1992, after a three-year trial of daylight saving. It was defeated with a 54.5% &quot;no&quot; vote, with regional and rural areas strongly opposed, and those in the metropolitan southeast in favor.

In 2003, the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents supported a proposal to observe year-round daylight saving time, but it has been opposed by some industries, by some postal workers and farmers, and particularly by those living in the northern regions of the UK.

In 2005, the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association and the National Association of Convenience Stores successfully lobbied for the 2007 extension to US DST.

In December 2008, the Daylight Saving for South East Queensland (DS4SEQ) political party was officially registered in Queensland, advocating the implementation of a dual-time-zone arrangement for daylight saving in South East Queensland, while the rest of the state maintained standard time. DS4SEQ contested the March 2009 Queensland state election with 32 candidates and received one percent of the statewide primary vote, equating to around 2.5% across the 32 electorates contested. After a three-year trial, more than 55% of Western Australians voted against DST in 2009, with rural areas strongly opposed. Queensland Independent member Peter Wellington introduced the Daylight Saving for South East Queensland Referendum Bill 2010 into the Queensland parliament on 14 April 2010, after being approached by the DS4SEQ political party, calling for a referendum at the next state election on the introduction of daylight saving into South East Queensland under a dual-time-zone arrangement. The Queensland parliament rejected Wellington&#x27;s bill on 15 June 2011.

Russia declared in 2011 that it would stay in DST all year long (UTC+4:00) and Belarus followed with a similar declaration. (The Soviet Union had operated under permanent &quot;summer time&quot; from 1930 to at least 1982.) Russia&#x27;s plan generated widespread complaints due to the dark of winter-time mornings, and thus was abandoned in 2014. The country changed its clocks to standard time (UTC+3:00) on 26 October 2014, intending to stay there permanently.

In the United States, Arizona (with the exception of the Navajo Nation), Hawaii, and the five populated territories (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the US Virgin Islands) do not participate in daylight saving time. Indiana only began participating in daylight saving time as recently as 2006. Since 2018, Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio has repeatedly filed bills to extend daylight saving time permanently into winter, without success.

Mexico observed summertime daylight saving time starting in 1996. In late 2022, the nation&#x27;s clocks &quot;fell back&quot; for the last time, in restoration of permanent standard time.

=== Religion ===
Some religious groups and individuals have opposed DST on religious grounds. For religious Muslims and Jews it makes religious practices such as prayer and fasting more difficult or inconvenient.
Some Muslim countries, such as Morocco, have temporarily abandoned DST during Ramadan.

In Israel, DST has been a point of contention between the religious and secular, resulting in fluctuations over the years, and a shorter DST period than in the EU and US. Religious Jews prefer a shorter DST due to DST delaying scheduled morning prayers, thus conflicting with standard working and business hours. Additionally, DST is ended before Yom Kippur (a 25-hour fast day starting and ending at sunset, much of which is spent praying in synagogue until the fast ends at sunset) since DST would result in the day ending later, which many feel makes it more difficult.

In the US, Orthodox Jewish groups have opposed extensions to DST, as well as a 2022 bipartisan bill that would make DST permanent, saying it will &quot;interfere with the ability of members of our community to engage in congregational prayers and get to their places of work on time.&quot;

== Effects ==
=== Effects on electricity consumption ===

Proponents of DST generally argue that it saves energy, promotes outdoor leisure activity in the evening (in summer), and is therefore good for physical and psychological health, reduces traffic accidents, reduces crime or is good for business. Opponents argue the actual energy savings are inconclusive.

Although energy conservation goals still remain, energy usage patterns have greatly changed since then. Electricity use is greatly affected by geography, climate, and economics, so the results of a study conducted in one place may not be relevant to another country or climate.

A 2017 meta-analysis of 44 studies found that DST leads to electricity savings of 0.3% during the days when DST applies. Several studies have suggested that DST increases motor fuel consumption, but a 2008 United States Department of Energy report found no significant increase in motor gasoline consumption due to the 2007 United States extension of DST. An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of incandescent lighting, once a primary use of electricity.

===Economic effects===
It has been argued that clock shifts correlate with decreased economic efficiency and that in 2000, the daylight-saving effect implied an estimated one-day loss of $31 billion on US stock exchanges. Others have asserted that the observed results depend on methodology and disputed the findings, though the original authors have refuted points raised by disputers.

=== Effects on health ===
There are measurable adverse effects of clock-shifts on human health. It has been shown to disrupt human circadian rhythms, negatively affecting human health in the process, and that the yearly DST clock-shifts can increase health risks such as heart attacks and traffic accidents.

A 2017 study in the &quot;American Economic Journal: Applied Economics&quot; estimated that &quot;the transition into DST caused over 30 deaths at a social cost of $275 million annually&quot;, primarily by increasing sleep deprivation.

A correlation between clock shifts and increase in traffic accidents has been observed in North America and the UK but not in Finland or Sweden. Four reports have found that this effect is smaller than the overall reduction in traffic fatalities. According to data shared by Titan Casket, hospitals see a 24% increase in heart attacks and a 6% increase in fatal crashes each year when the time changes. In 2018, the European Parliament, reviewing a possible abolition of DST, approved a more in-depth evaluation examining the disruption of the human body&#x27;s circadian rhythms which provided evidence suggesting the existence of an association between DST clock-shifts and a modest increase of occurrence of acute myocardial infarction, especially in the first week after the spring shift. However a Netherlands study found, against the majority of investigations, contrary or minimal effect. Year-round standard time (not year-round DST) is proposed by some to be the preferred option for public health and safety. Clock shifts were found to increase the risk of heart attack by 10 percent, and to disrupt sleep and reduce its efficiency. Effects on seasonal adaptation of the circadian rhythm can be severe and last for weeks.

=== Effects on social relations ===
DST hurts prime-time television broadcast ratings, drive-ins and other theaters. Artificial outdoor lighting has a marginal and sometimes even contradictory influence on crime and fear of crime.

Later sunsets from DST are thought to affect behavior; for example, increasing participation in after-school sports programs or outdoor afternoon sports such as golf, and attendance at professional sporting events. Advocates of daylight saving time argue that having more hours of daylight between the end of a typical workday and evening induces people to consume other goods and services.

In 2022, a publication of three replicating studies of individuals, between individuals, and transecting societies, demonstrated that sleep loss affects the human motivation to help others, which in its fMRI findings is &quot;associated with deactivation of key nodes within the social cognition brain network that facilitates prosociality.&quot; Furthermore, they detected, through analysis of over three million real-world charitable donations, that the loss of sleep inflicted by the transition to daylight saving time reduces altruistic giving compared to controls (being states not implementing DST). They conclude that the effects on civil society are &quot;non-trivial&quot;.

Another study, which also examined sleep manipulation due to the shift to daylight saving time in the spring, analyzed archival data from judicial punishment imposed by US federal courts which showed sleep-deprived judges exact more severe penalties.

=== Inconvenience ===
DST&#x27;s clock shifts have the disadvantage of complexity. People must remember to change their clocks; this can be time-consuming, particularly for mechanical clocks that cannot be moved backward safely. People who work across time zone boundaries need to keep track of multiple DST rules, as not all locations observe DST or observe it the same way. The length of the calendar day becomes variable; it is no longer always 24 hours. Disruption to meetings, travel, broadcasts, billing systems, and records management is common, and can be expensive. During an autumn transition from 02:00 to 01:00, a clock shows local times from 01:00:00 through 01:59:59 twice, possibly leading to confusion.

Many farmers oppose DST, particularly dairy farmers as the milking patterns of their cows do not change with the time, and others whose hours are set by the sun. There is concern for schoolchildren who are out in the darkness during the morning due to late sunrises.

=== Remediation ===
Some clock-shift problems could be avoided by adjusting clocks continuously or at least more gradually—for example, Willett at first suggested weekly 20-minute transitions—but this would add complexity and has never been implemented. DST inherits and can magnify the disadvantages of standard time. For example, when reading a sundial, one must compensate for it along with time zone and natural discrepancies. Also, sun-exposure guidelines such as avoiding the sun within two hours of noon become less accurate when DST is in effect.

==Terminology==
As explained by Richard Meade in the English Journal of the (American) National Council of Teachers of English, the form &quot;daylight savings time&quot; (with an &quot;s&quot;) was already much more common than the older form &quot;daylight saving time&quot; in American English (&quot;the change has been virtually accomplished&quot;) in 1978. Nevertheless, dictionaries such as Merriam-Webster&#x27;s, American Heritage, and Oxford, which typically describe actual usage instead of prescribing outdated usage (and therefore also list the newer form), still list the older form first. This is because the older form is still very common in print and is preferred by many editors. (&quot;Although &quot;daylight saving time&quot; is considered correct, &quot;daylight savings time&quot; (with an &quot;s&quot;) is commonly used.&quot;) The first two words are sometimes hyphenated (&quot;daylight-saving(s) time&quot;). Merriam-Webster&#x27;s also lists the forms daylight saving, daylight savings (both without &quot;time&quot;), and daylight time. The Oxford Dictionary of American Usage and Style explains the development and current situation as follows:Although the singular form &quot;daylight saving time&quot; is the original one, dating from the early 20th century—and is preferred by some usage critics—the plural form is now extremely common in AmE. [...] The rise of &quot;daylight savings time&quot; appears to have resulted from the avoidance of a miscue: when &quot;saving&quot; is used, readers might puzzle momentarily over whether &quot;saving&quot; is a gerund (the saving of daylight) or a participle (the time for saving). [...] Using &quot;savings&quot; as the adjective—as in &quot;savings account&quot; or &quot;savings bond&quot;—makes perfect sense. More than that, it ought to be accepted as the better form.In Britain, Willett&#x27;s 1907 proposal used the term &quot;daylight saving&quot;, but by 1911, the term &quot;summer time&quot; replaced &quot;daylight saving time&quot; in draft legislation. The same or similar expressions are used in many other languages: &quot;Sommerzeit&quot; in German, &quot;zomertijd&quot; in Dutch, &quot;kesäaika&quot; in Finnish, &quot;horario de verano&quot; or &quot;hora de verano&quot; in Spanish, and &quot;heure d&#x27;été&quot; in French.

The name of local time typically changes when DST is observed. American English replaces &quot;standard&quot; with &quot;daylight&quot;: for example, &quot;Pacific Standard Time&quot; (&quot;PST&quot;) becomes &quot;Pacific Daylight Time&quot; (&quot;PDT&quot;). In the United Kingdom, the standard term for UK time when advanced by one hour is &quot;British Summer Time&quot; (BST), and British English typically inserts &quot;summer&quot; into other time zone names, e.g. &quot;Central European Time&quot; (&quot;CET&quot;) becomes &quot;Central European Summer Time&quot; (&quot;CEST&quot;).
In North American English, people use the mnemonic &quot;spring forward, fall back&quot; (also &quot;spring ahead ...&quot;, &quot;spring up ...&quot;, and &quot;... fall behind&quot;) to remember the direction in which to shift the clocks.

==Computing==
Changes to DST rules cause problems in existing computer installations. For example, the 2007 change to DST rules in North America required that many computer systems be upgraded, with the greatest onus on e-mail and calendar programs. The upgrades required a significant effort by corporate information technologists.

Some applications standardize on UTC to avoid problems with clock shifts and time zone differences. Likewise, most modern operating systems internally handle and store all times as UTC and only convert to local time for display. However, even if UTC is used internally, the systems still require external leap second updates and time zone information to correctly calculate local time as needed. Many systems in use today base their date/time calculations from data derived from the tz database also known as zoneinfo.

===IANA time zone database===
The tz database maps a name to the named location&#x27;s historical and predicted clock shifts. This database is used by many computer software systems, including most Unix-like operating systems, Java, and the Oracle RDBMS; HP&#x27;s &quot;tztab&quot; database is similar but incompatible. When temporal authorities change DST rules, zoneinfo updates are installed as part of ordinary system maintenance. In Unix-like systems the TZ environment variable specifies the location name, as in codice_1. In many of those systems there is also a system-wide setting that is applied if the TZ environment variable is not set: this setting is controlled by the contents of the codice_2 file, which is usually a symbolic link or hard link to one of the zoneinfo files. Internal time is stored in time-zone-independent Unix time; the TZ is used by each of potentially many simultaneous users and processes to independently localize time display.

Older or stripped-down systems may support only the TZ values required by POSIX, which specify at most one start and end rule explicitly in the value. For example, codice_3 specifies time for the eastern United States starting in 2007. Such a TZ value must be changed whenever DST rules change, and the new value applies to all years, mishandling some older timestamps.

==Opposition to clock changes==
A move to permanent daylight saving time (staying on summer hours all year with no clock shifts) is sometimes advocated and is currently implemented in some jurisdictions such as Argentina, Belarus, Iceland, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, Namibia, Saskatchewan, Singapore, Syria, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Yukon. Although Saskatchewan follows Central Standard Time, its capital city Regina experiences solar noon close to 13:00, in effect putting the city on permanent daylight time. Similarly, Yukon is classified as being in the Mountain Time Zone, though in effect it observes permanent Pacific Daylight Time to align with the Pacific time zone in summer, but local solar noon in the capital Whitehorse occurs nearer to 14:00, in effect putting Whitehorse on &quot;double daylight time&quot;.

The United Kingdom and Ireland put clocks forward by an extra hour during World War II and experimented with year-round summer time between 1968 and 1971. Russia switched to permanent DST from 2011 to 2014, but the move proved unpopular because of the extremely late winter sunrises; in 2014, Russia switched permanently back to standard time. However, the change to permanent DST has proven popular in Turkey, with the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources saying the practice saves &quot;millions in energy costs and reduces depression and anxiety levels associated with short exposure to daylight&quot;.

In September 2018, the European Commission proposed to end seasonal clock changes as of 2019. Member states would have the option of observing either daylight saving time all year round or standard time all year round. In March 2019, the European Parliament approved the commission&#x27;s proposal, while deferring implementation from 2019 until 2021. In response to this proposition, the European Sleep Research Society stated &quot;installing permanent Central European Time (CET, standard time or &#x27;wintertime&#x27;) is the best option for public health.&quot; , the decision has not been confirmed by the Council of the European Union. The council has asked the commission to produce a detailed assessment of its effects, but the Commission considers that the onus is on the Member States to find a common position in Council. As a result, progress on the issue is effectively blocked. 

In the United States, several states have enacted legislation to implement permanent DST, but the bills would require Congress to change federal law in order to take effect. The Uniform Time Act of 1966 permits states to opt out of DST and observe permanent standard time, but it does not permit permanent DST. Florida senator Marco Rubio in particular has promoted changing the federal law to implement permanent DST, with the support of the Florida Chamber of Commerce seeking to boost evening revenue. In 2022, Rubio&#x27;s &quot;Sunshine Protection Act&quot; passed the United States Senate without committee review by way of voice consent, with many senators afterward stating they were unaware of the vote or its topic. The bill was stopped in the US House, where questions were raised as to whether permanent DST or standard time would be more beneficial.

Advocates cite the same advantages as normal DST without the problems associated with the twice yearly clock shifts. Additional benefits have also been cited, including safer roadways, boosting the tourism industry, and energy savings. Detractors cite the relatively late sunrises, particularly in winter, that year-round DST entails.

Some experts in circadian rhythms and sleep health recommend year-round standard time as the preferred option for public health and safety. However, some experts state that permanent daylight saving time is still a better option when compared to annual clock changes. Several chronobiology societies have published position papers against adopting DST permanently. A paper by the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms states: &quot;based on comparisons of large populations living in DST or ST or on western versus eastern edges of time zones, the advantages of permanent ST outweigh switching to DST annually or permanently.&quot; The World Federation of Societies for Chronobiology recommended &quot;reassigning countries and regions to their actual sun-clock based time zones&quot; and held the position of being &quot;against the switching between DST and Standard Time and even more so against adopting DST permanently.&quot; The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) holds the position that &quot;seasonal time changes should be abolished in favor of a fixed, national, year-round standard time,&quot; and that &quot;standard time is a better option than daylight saving time for our health, mood and well-being.&quot; Their position was endorsed by 20 other organizations, including the American College of Chest Physicians, National Safety Council, and National PTA.

Current public opinion polls show mixed results. Surveys reported between 2021 and 2022 by the National Sleep Foundation, YouGov, CBS, and Monmouth University indicate more Americans would prefer permanent DST. A 2019 survey by the National Opinion Research Center and a 2021 survey by the Associated Press indicate more Americans would prefer permanent Standard Time. The National Sleep Foundation, YouGov, and Monmouth University polls leaned significantly in favor of seeing daylight saving time made permanent. The Monmouth University poll reported 44% preferring year-round DST and 13% preferring year-round standard time. The NORC at the University of Chicago found 79% of those interviewed to be in favor of permanent DST during the Oil Crisis in December 1973; 42% of poll takers supported it the following February.

<text>&quot;Let&#x27;s roll&quot; is a colloquialism that has been used extensively as a command to move and start an activity, attack, mission or project. They were the last recorded words of passenger Todd Beamer on board United Airlines Flight 93 during the September 11 attacks in 2001, before he and other passengers attempted to storm the cockpit and retake the plane from the hijackers. The slogan subsequently became a battle cry for American forces during the war on terror.

==Origins==

In the American west, many wagon trains began their journeys with the shout &quot;Wagons roll!&quot; from the head of the train. A less formal terminology would soon develop from the historic precedent. The phrase, &quot;let&#x27;s roll&quot; has been used as early as 1908 in the cadence song now called &quot;The Army Goes Rolling Along&quot;, which likely extended into tank usage. 

&quot;The Roads Must Roll&quot;, a science fiction story written in 1940 by Robert A. Heinlein, mentions a re-worded version of &quot;The Roll of the Caissons&quot; called &quot;Road Songs of the Transport Cadets&quot;. The protagonist of the 1937 supernatural comedy, &quot;Topper&quot;, played by Cary Grant, uses the phrase &quot;Let&#x27;s roll&quot; to his wife, played by Constance Bennett, to indicate they should immediately exit their friend&#x27;s stuffy office and find a drink. The protagonist of Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s 1950 novel &quot;Across the River and into the Trees&quot;, Colonel Dick Cantwell, based on World War II commander Charles &quot;Buck&quot; Lanham, uses the phrase to his driver. The verb &quot;roll&quot; has been used in both the film and recording industry to signal the beginning of a film or audio recording.

==September 11 attacks==

On September 11, 2001, Todd Beamer, a passenger on the hijacked United Airlines Flight 93, tried to place a call through an air phone, but he was routed to a customer service representative instead, who passed him on to supervisor Lisa Jefferson. Beamer reported that one passenger had been killed and that a flight attendant had told him that both the pilot and co-pilot had been forced from the cockpit and may have been injured. He was also on the phone when the plane made a quick and violent turn. Later, he told the operator that some of the other passengers were planning to attack the hijackers and regain control of the aircraft, after they learned about what happened at the World Trade Center and The Pentagon. According to Jefferson, Beamer&#x27;s last audible words were &quot;Are you ready? Okay. Let&#x27;s roll.&quot;

In a November 8 address from the World Congress Center in Atlanta, Georgia, President George W. Bush invoked Beamer&#x27;s words: &quot;Some of our greatest moments have been acts of courage for which no one could have been prepared. But we have our marching orders. My fellow Americans, let&#x27;s roll!&quot; He used them again in the 2002 State of the Union address: &quot;For too long our culture has said, &#x27;If it feels good, do it.&#x27; Now America is embracing a new ethic and a new creed: &#x27;Let&#x27;s roll.

==Cultural impact==
===Music===
*Several musicians and bands have written songs entitled or including the phrase &quot;Let&#x27;s Roll&quot;, with the songs typically referring to Flight 93 or Todd Beamer. The first song with the name, Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Roll&quot;, was released as a single in November 2001, and was later included in his album &quot;Are You Passionate?&quot;. The following year, three diverse groups released songs: hard rock group L.A. Guns included &quot;OK, Let&#x27;s Roll&quot; in their album &quot;Waking the Dead&quot;, country music duo The Bellamy Brothers&#x27;s song &quot;Let&#x27;s Roll, America&quot; was on &quot;Redneck Girls Forever&quot;, and Christian rock group dc Talk recorded and released a single entitled &quot;Let&#x27;s Roll&quot; despite being on hiatus.
*Three other 9/11-related songs by the name &quot;Let&#x27;s Roll&quot; have been released in the following years. Montreal rock band The Stills&#x27;s song was included on their debut album &quot;Logic Will Break Your Heart&quot; in 2003. Jonny L&#x27;s song included a sample of President George W. Bush&#x27;s 2002 State of the Union address which included the phrase. In 2004, Ray Stevens offered up the self-penned &quot;Let&#x27;s Roll&quot; and referenced Todd Beamer in the lyrics. Stevens&#x27; recording appeared on his 2004 &quot;Thank You!&quot; CD. The recording later appeared on his 2005 &quot;Box Set&quot; project and on his 2010 &quot;We the People&quot; project.
*Melissa Etheridge&#x27;s 2004 song &quot;Tuesday Morning&quot;, written in honor of Flight 93 passenger Mark Bingham, concluded with the phrase, &quot;Let&#x27;s roll&quot;.

===Government===

* The phrase became especially known and popular after being used by President George W. Bush in a speech to AmeriCorps volunteers and during his 2002 State of the Union address. Even though the phrase was in common use long before September 11, many soon tried to lay claim to it as a trademark. The Todd M. Beamer Foundation was eventually granted a trademark for uses of the phrase relating to &quot;pre-recorded compact discs, audio tapes, digital audio tapes, and phonograph records featuring music.&quot;
* In early 2002, United States Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. John P. Jumper ordered that one airplane in each USAF squadron and all USAF demonstration planes would bear an image of an eagle on an American flag with the words &quot;Let&#x27;s Roll&quot; and &quot;Spirit of 9-11&quot;, to remain until the first anniversary of the attack. It was also used by Lisa Beamer, widow of Todd, in a 2003 book titled &quot;Let&#x27;s Roll: Ordinary People, Extraordinary Courage&quot;.

===Sports===
*In the 2002 college football season, the Florida State Seminoles used &quot;Let&#x27;s Roll&quot; as their official team slogan. After an initial uproar against the team by people who considered its usage in bad taste, the Todd M. Beamer Foundation officially licensed the trademark to the team.
*NASCAR driver Bobby Labonte drove a 9/11 tribute car with the words &quot;Let&#x27;s Roll&quot; on the hood of his stock car in the 2002 MBNA All-American Heroes 400 at Dover International Speedway.
*Detroit Red Wings goaltender Jimmy Howard has the inscription &quot;Lets Roll&quot; on the back of his goalie helmet in reference to Flight 93.

===Media===
*The phrase was also used in an episode of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; (&quot;The Survivor&quot;, season 4, episode 9). The show&#x27;s main character, Larry David, says the phrase inadvertently to his rabbi once he and his wife are ready to go out and renew their vows, who then becomes offended because of a relative of his died on September 11, 2001 (&quot;You knew my brother-in-law died on September 11th; how dare you say something like that?!&quot;). Larry takes issue with this, as his rabbi&#x27;s relative was hit by a bike messenger (&quot;Well, with all due respect, wasn&#x27;t that just a coincidence?&quot;), in an incident completely unrelated to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
* The phrase was used in the film: &quot;Let&#x27;s Roll: The Story of Flight 93&quot;, which is a dramatized reconstruction of Flight 93.

<doc id="47563" wikidata="Q184511" url="?curid=47563" title="Idiom">
<text>An idiom is a phrase or expression that largely or exclusively carries a figurative or non-literal meaning, rather than making any literal sense. Categorized as formulaic language, an idiomatic expression&#x27;s meaning is different from the literal meanings of each word inside it. Idioms occur frequently in all languages; in English alone there are an estimated twenty-five thousand idiomatic expressions. Some well known idioms in English are &quot;spill the beans&quot; (meaning &quot;reveal secret information&quot;), &quot;it&#x27;s raining cats and dogs&quot; (meaning &quot;it&#x27;s raining intensely&quot;), and &quot;break a leg&quot; (meaning &quot;good luck&quot;).

==Derivations==
Many idiomatic expressions were meant literally in their original use, but occasionally the attribution of the literal meaning changed and the phrase itself grew away from its original roots—typically leading to a folk etymology. For instance, the phrase &quot;spill the beans&quot; (meaning to reveal a secret) is first attested in 1919, but has been said to originate from an ancient method of voting by depositing beans in jars, which could be spilled, prematurely revealing the results.

Other idioms are deliberately figurative. For example, &quot;break a leg&quot; is an expression commonly said to wish a person good luck just prior to their giving a performance or presentation, which apparently wishes injury on them. However, the phrase likely comes from a loan translation from a phrase of German and Yiddish origin, which is why it makes no literal sense in English.

==Compositionality==
In linguistics, idioms are usually presumed to be figures of speech contradicting the principle of compositionality. That compositionality is the key notion for the analysis of idioms emphasized in most accounts of idioms. This principle states that the meaning of a whole should be constructed from the meanings of the parts that make up the whole. In other words, one should be in a position to understand the whole if one understands the meanings of each of the parts that make up the whole.

For example, if the phrase &quot;Fred &quot;kicked the bucket&quot;&quot; is understood compositionally, it means that Fred has literally kicked an actual, physical bucket. The idiomatic reading, however, is non-compositional: it means that Fred has died. Arriving at the idiomatic reading from the literal reading is unlikely for most speakers. What this means is that the idiomatic reading is, rather, stored as a single lexical item that is now largely independent of the literal reading.

In phraseology, idioms are defined as a sub-type of phraseme, the meaning of which is not the regular sum of the meanings of its component parts. John Saeed defines an idiom as collocated words that became affixed to each other until metamorphosing into a fossilised term. This collocation of words redefines each component word in the word-group and becomes an &quot;idiomatic expression&quot;. Idioms usually do not translate well; in some cases, when an idiom is translated directly word-for-word into another language, either its meaning is changed or it is meaningless.

When two or three words are conventionally used together in a particular sequence, they form an irreversible binomial. For example, a person may be &quot;left high and dry&quot;, but never &quot;left dry and high&quot;. Not all irreversible binomials are idioms, however: &quot;chips and dip&quot; is irreversible, but its meaning is straightforwardly derived from its components.

== Mobility ==
Idioms possess varying degrees of mobility. Whereas some idioms are used only in a routine form, others can undergo syntactic modifications such as passivization, raising constructions, and clefting, demonstrating separable constituencies within the idiom. &quot;Mobile idioms&quot;, allowing such movement, maintain their idiomatic meaning where &quot;fixed idioms&quot; do not:
;Mobile: &quot;I spilled the beans on our project.&quot; → &quot;The beans were spilled on our project.&quot; (valid)
;Fixed: &quot;The old man kicked the bucket.&quot; → *&quot;The bucket was kicked&quot; (by the old man). (confusing)
Many fixed idioms lack &quot;semantic composition&quot;, meaning that the idiom contains the semantic role of a verb, but not of any object. This is true of &quot;kick the bucket&quot;, which means &quot;die&quot;. By contrast, the semantically composite idiom &quot;spill the beans&quot;, meaning &quot;reveal a secret&quot;, contains both a semantic verb and object, &quot;reveal&quot; and &quot;secret&quot;. Semantically composite idioms have a syntactic similarity between their surface and semantic forms.

The types of movement allowed for certain idioms also relate to the degree to which the literal reading of the idiom has a connection to its idiomatic meaning. This is referred to as &quot;motivation&quot; or &quot;transparency&quot;. While most idioms that do not display semantic composition generally do not allow non-adjectival modification, those that are also motivated allow lexical substitution. For example, &quot;oil the wheels&quot; and &quot;grease the wheels&quot; allow variation for nouns that elicit a similar literal meaning. These types of changes can occur only when speakers can easily recognize a connection between what the idiom is meant to express and its literal meaning, thus an idiom like &quot;kick the bucket&quot; cannot occur as &quot;kick the pot&quot;.

From the perspective of dependency grammar, idioms are represented as a catena which cannot be interrupted by non-idiomatic content. Although syntactic modifications introduce disruptions to the idiomatic structure, this continuity is only required for idioms as lexical entries.

Certain idioms, allowing unrestricted syntactic modification, can be said to be metaphors. Expressions such as &quot;jump on the bandwagon&quot;, &quot;pull strings&quot;, and &quot;draw the line&quot; all represent their meaning independently in their verbs and objects, making them compositional. In the idiom &quot;jump on the bandwagon&quot;, &quot;jump on&quot; involves joining something and a &#x27;bandwagon&#x27; can refer to a collective cause, regardless of context.

==Translation==
A word-by-word translation of an opaque idiom will most likely not convey the same meaning in other languages. The English idiom &quot;kick the bucket&quot; has a variety of equivalents in other languages, such as &quot;kopnąć w kalendarz&quot; (&quot;kick the calendar&quot;) in Polish, &quot;casser sa pipe&quot; (&quot;to break one’s pipe&quot;) in French and &quot;tirare le cuoia&quot; (&quot;pulling the leathers&quot;) in Italian.

Some idioms are transparent. Much of their meaning gets through if they are taken (or translated) literally. For example, &quot;lay one&#x27;s cards on the table&quot; meaning to reveal previously unknown intentions or to reveal a secret. Transparency is a matter of degree; &quot;spill the beans&quot; (to let secret information become known) and &quot;leave no stone unturned&quot; (to do everything possible in order to achieve or find something) are not entirely literally interpretable but involve only a slight metaphorical broadening. Another category of idioms is a word having several meanings, sometimes simultaneously, sometimes discerned from the context of its usage. This is seen in the (mostly uninflected) English language in polysemes, the common use of the same word for an activity, for those engaged in it, for the product used, for the place or time of an activity, and sometimes for a verb.

Idioms tend to confuse those unfamiliar with them; students of a new language must learn its idiomatic expressions as vocabulary. Many natural language words have &quot;idiomatic origins&quot; but are assimilated and so lose their figurative senses. For example, in Portuguese, the expression &quot;saber de coração&quot; &#x27;to know by heart&#x27;, with the same meaning as in English, was shortened to &#x27;saber de cor&#x27;, and, later, to the verb &quot;decorar&quot;, meaning &quot;memorize&quot;.

In 2015, TED collected 40 examples of bizarre idioms that cannot be translated literally. They include the Swedish saying &quot;to slide in on a shrimp sandwich&quot;, which refers those who did not have to work to get where they are.

Conversely, idioms may be shared between multiple languages. For example, the Arabic phrase في نفس المركب (&quot;fi nafs al-markeb&quot;) is translated as &quot;in the same boat&quot;, and it carries the same figurative meaning as the equivalent idiom in English. Another example would be the Japanese yojijukugo 一石二鳥 (&quot;isseki ni chō&quot;), which is translated as &quot;one stone, two birds&quot;. This is, of course, analogous to &quot;to kill two birds with one stone&quot; in English.

According to the German linguist Elizabeth Piirainen, the idiom &quot;to get on one&#x27;s nerves&quot; has the same figurative meaning in 57 European languages. She also says that the phrase &quot;to shed crocodile tears&quot;, meaning to express insincere sorrow, is similarly widespread in European languages but is also used in Arabic, Swahili, Persian, Chinese, Vietnamese, Mongolian, and several others.

The origin of cross-language idioms is uncertain. One theory is that cross-language idioms are a language contact phenomenon, resulting from a word-for-word translation called a calque. Piirainen says that may happen as a result of lingua franca usage in which speakers incorporate expressions from their own native tongue, which exposes them to speakers of other languages. Other theories suggest they come from a shared ancestor-language or that humans are naturally predisposed to develop certain metaphors.

==Non-compositionality==
The non-compositionality of meaning of idioms challenges theories of syntax. The fixed words of many idioms do not qualify as constituents in any sense. For example:

The fixed words of this idiom (in bold) do not form a constituent in any theory&#x27;s analysis of syntactic structure because the object of the preposition (here &quot;this situation&quot;) is not part of the idiom (but rather it is an argument of the idiom). One can know that it is not part of the idiom because it is variable; for example, &quot;How do we get to the bottom of this situation / the claim / the phenomenon / her statement /&quot; etc. What this means is that theories of syntax that take the constituent to be the fundamental unit of syntactic analysis are challenged. The manner in which units of meaning are assigned to units of syntax remains unclear. This problem has motivated a tremendous amount of discussion and debate in linguistics circles and it is a primary motivator behind the Construction Grammar framework.

A relatively recent development in the syntactic analysis of idioms departs from a constituent-based account of syntactic structure, preferring instead the catena-based account. The catena unit was introduced to linguistics by William O&#x27;Grady in 1998. Any word or any combination of words that are linked together by dependencies qualifies as a catena. The words constituting idioms are stored as catenae in the lexicon, and as such, they are concrete units of syntax. The dependency grammar trees of a few sentences containing non-constituent idioms illustrate the point:

The fixed words of the idiom (in orange) in each case are linked together by dependencies; they form a catena. The material that is outside of the idiom (in normal black script) is not part of the idiom. The following two trees illustrate proverbs:

The fixed words of the proverbs (in orange) again form a catena each time. The adjective &quot;nitty-gritty&quot; and the adverb &quot;always&quot; are not part of the respective proverb and their appearance does not interrupt the fixed words of the proverb. A caveat concerning the catena-based analysis of idioms concerns their status in the lexicon. Idioms are lexical items, which means they are stored as catenae in the lexicon. In the actual syntax, however, some idioms can be broken up by various functional constructions.

The catena-based analysis of idioms provides a basis for an understanding of meaning compositionality. The Principle of Compositionality can in fact be maintained. Units of meaning are being assigned to catenae, whereby many of these catenae are not constituents.

Various studies have investigated methods to develop the ability to interpret idioms in children with various diagnoses including autism, moderate learning difficulties, developmental language disorder and typically developing weak readers.

<doc id="47565" wikidata="Q26821893" url="?curid=47565" title="Squalius cephalus">
<text>The common chub (Squalius cephalus), also known as the European chub or simply chub, is a species of European freshwater ray-finned fish in the carp family Cyprinidae, that frequents both slow and moderate rivers, as well as canals, lakes and still waterbodies of various kinds.

==Description==
It is a stocky fish with a large rounded head. Its body is long and cylindrical in shape and is covered in large greenish-brown scales which are edged with narrow bands of black across the back, paling to golden on the flanks and even paler on the belly. The tail is dark brown or black, the dorsal fin is a greyish-green in colour and all the other fins are orange-red. The dorsal fin has 3 spines and 7–9 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 7–10 rays. The vertebrae count is 42–48. It can grow to 60 cm standard length but most fish are around 30 cm.

==Distribution==
The chub is distributed throughout most of northern Eurasia, it can be found in the rivers flowing into the North, Baltic, northern Black, White, Barents and Caspian Sea basins, the Atlantic basins south to Adour drainage in France and in Great Britain north to 56°, in Scandinavia in southern Finland and southern Sweden north to around Stockholm. In the Mediterranean basin it is found in France from the Var to the Hérault, and may also be present in the Aude, drainages. It is absent as a native species from Ireland and Italy but has been introduced to both countries; in Italy &quot;S. cephalus&quot; is present and acclimatised since decades, but it seems marginally found here and there (mainly in the Po river basin), never forming well established populations.

==Habitat and ecology==
It is most abundant in small rivers and large streams in the &quot;barbel zone&quot; where there are riffles and pools. It occurs along the banks of slow-flowing lowland rivers in large lake and even in mountain streams. Chub in lakes undertake spawning migrations into inflowing streams. The adult fish are solitary but the juvenile fish are sociable and occur in shoals. The larvae and juveniles prefer rather shallow habitats along shorelines and these smaller fish have a varied diet of aquatic and terrestrial animals while the large, solitary adults prey mainly on freshwater shrimp and small fishes. In the United Kingdom, chub have been recorded feeding on worms, molluscs, crustaceans, and various insect larvae while large chub eat considerable numbers of small fish, such as chub, eels, common dace, common roach, gudgeon and minnows as well as frogs, crayfish, voles and young water birds. They have also been observed eating berries such as blackberries and elderberry from trees overhanging the water. They feed throughout the year if there are opportunities, even in the coldest days of midwinter.

Spawning happens when the water temperature reaches 14 °C, and lasts from May to September. They spawn in fast-flowing water above gravel substrates but only infrequently will they spawn among submerged vegetation. The females spawn more than once during a season and each female will mate with several males. The males aggregate at spawning sites and will follow the ripe females, often with much splashing, to shallow riffles. Females lay pale yellow sticky eggs which adhere to the gravel, weed and stones in flowing water. Sexual maturity in chub is influenced by environmental factors with males reaching sexual maturity at the age of 2–4 years while females reach it at 4–6 although some individuals may mature much later than this. The fish can live for up to 22 years in the wild, where the age of fish can be assessed through by the number of rings that are visible in scales, these represent seasonal growth patterns.

== Threats ==

Recent work has shown that chub ingest microplastic particles. Whereas many as 25% of sampled fish contained particles, these particles were not found in muscles. Many of the particles found were fibres that are released from clothes during washing, these are also ingested by macroinvertebrates such as &quot;Daphnia&quot;&quot;.&quot; Chub can also be contaminated by metal pollution such as copper, magnesium and sodium which can accumulate in tissues like the muscle, gills and liver. Young of the year fish contained particularly high levels of metal contaminants.

==Fishing for chub==
They are popular with anglers due to their readiness to feed, and thus to be caught, in almost any conditions. Small chub are freely biting fish which even inexperienced anglers find easy to catch. As they become larger, however, chub become more wary and are easily spooked by noise or visual disturbance. Consequently, large chub (in excess of 2 kg) are keenly sought by anglers who prefer to target specific fish.

The British angling record for chub was broken on 16 March 2012 when Neil Steven caught a fish from the River Lea in Essex, though there are several over 10 lb on the Angling Trust&#x27;s Top 50 list, which have been deprecated for various reasons. The European record is . The chub can reach a maximum length of 64–82 cm (24–31.5 in).
===Tackle and tactics===
Smaller chub are not too difficult to catch and on small or medium-sized rivers, a stick-float fishing approach can be adopted or even a swim-feeder and using almost any bait including maggots, luncheon meat, sweetcorn and even small lures and flies. Chub also eat marine derived fishmeal-based pellets and diets of wild chub diets contain 44% of these pellets. Catching the larger specimens however requires a patient and stealthy approach as most larger chub are caught on the smaller, clearer rivers and as a result, the angler must make their presence as subtle as possible and yet again, not a lot of tackle is required and most anglers may even set their tackle up before they get their favored spot as there is less noise from tackle being set up that may disturb the fish. A classic chub spot is just hanging off (or even inside) branches/bushes brushing through the water as chub are quite sensitive to sunlight and most anglers may fish at sunrise or sunset when the chub leave their entangled home. An angler should also look for where the current is being pushed out, causing a re-circulation pattern behind what ever is pushing the current outwards and this is where much food will wash around and where there will probably be feeding fish. Like with the smaller chub, a range of baits can be used but smaller baits such as maggots may attract small fish like minnows (especially on smaller rivers) so a larger bait such as luncheon meat is best used. In terms of the line setup, line ratings of a range of 4–8 pounds breaking-strain is ideal, less experienced anglers should use the tougher rating until they have gained knowledge about &#x27;playing&#x27; the fish.

;Feeder/ledger fishing
Traditionally a quiver-tip rod is used with at least four-pound line rating due to the weight of the ledger/feeder (heavier weights need heavier line). In feeder fishing, bait will be put on a hook and inside a swim-feeder which the current will cause to flow out and attract fish to the hook&#x27;s position so it involves fishing upstream of where the fish are, this usually involves smaller baits like bread, sweetcorn or maggots. The same applies to ledgering except there is a weight (called a ledger) instead of a swim-feeder and usually heavier baits are used here such as luncheon meat. Another method known as touch-ledgering can be used which involves not using a quiver-tip but instead holding the line that is loose off the reel and feeling for any pulls or the line going loose. Some anglers do this without any weights and let the bait slowly drift downstream with the line steadily moving through their hands, slugs and luncheon meat are excellent for this method.

;Float fishing
This method could involve fishing under the rod-tip in deep water or letting the float gently drift to where the fish may be situated (known as trotting) whilst throwing portions of bait in the stream to encourage feeding. Usually a lighter rod may be used (no more than ten-foot) and sometimes a centrepin reel is used as it allows the line to smoothly come off the reel. Anglers must strike quickly when trotting as bites can be easy to miss sometimes. Drifting baits such as bread, sweetcorn and maggots are usually used here.

;Lure fishing
This method is usually for the larger chub, a light spinning/lure rod with a fixed-spool reel of at least 10 pounds line rating as it is easy to snag onto debris when doing this method. Small lures such as bar-spoons and spoons or even small soft-plastics can imitate the smaller fish such as minnows that the larger chub feed on.

;Fly-fishing
Using flies such as damselfly patterns or even larger, dark patterns such as those that imitate slugs can be very good if presented correctly. More obvious, shiny flies that imitate small fish may work for more aggressive chub, this method is all-year but best in warmer months. Nymph patterns also do well. In late summer grass hopper and beetle fly patterns also work very well.

<text>A low Earth orbit (LEO) is an orbit around Earth with a period of 128 minutes or less (making at least 11.25 orbits per day) and an eccentricity less than 0.25. Most of the artificial objects in outer space are in LEO, peaking in number at an altitude around , while the farthest in LEO, before medium Earth orbit (MEO), have an altitude of 2,000 kilometers, about one-third of the radius of Earth and near the beginning of the inner Van Allen radiation belt.

The term &quot;LEO region&quot; is used for the area of space below an altitude of (about one-third of Earth&#x27;s radius). Objects in orbits that pass through this zone, even if they have an apogee further out or are sub-orbital, are carefully tracked since they present a collision risk to the many LEO satellites.

No human spaceflights other than the lunar missions of the Apollo program (1968-1972) have taken place beyond LEO. All space stations to date have operated geocentric within LEO.

== Defining characteristics ==
A wide variety of sources define LEO in terms of altitude. The altitude of an object in an elliptic orbit can vary significantly along the orbit. Even for circular orbits, the altitude above ground can vary by as much as (especially for polar orbits) due to the oblateness of Earth&#x27;s spheroid figure and local topography. While definitions based on altitude are inherently ambiguous, most of them fall within the range specified by an orbit period of 128 minutes because, according to Kepler&#x27;s third law, this corresponds to a semi-major axis of . For circular orbits, this in turn corresponds to an altitude of above the mean radius of Earth, which is consistent with some of the upper altitude limits in some LEO definitions.

The LEO region is defined by some sources as a region in space that LEO orbits occupy. Some highly elliptical orbits may pass through the LEO region near their lowest altitude (or perigee) but are not in a LEO orbit because their highest altitude (or apogee) exceeds . Sub-orbital objects can also reach the LEO region but are not in a LEO orbit because they re-enter the atmosphere. The distinction between LEO orbits and the LEO region is especially important for analysis of possible collisions between objects which may not themselves be in LEO but could collide with satellites or debris in LEO orbits.

==Orbital characteristics==
The mean orbital velocity needed to maintain a stable low Earth orbit is about , which translates to . However, this depends on the exact altitude of the orbit. Calculated for a circular orbit of the orbital velocity is , but for a higher orbit the velocity is reduced to . The launch vehicle&#x27;s delta-v needed to achieve low Earth orbit starts around .

The pull of gravity in LEO is only slightly less than on the Earth&#x27;s surface. This is because the distance to LEO from the Earth&#x27;s surface is much less than the Earth&#x27;s radius. However, an object in orbit is in a permanent free fall around Earth, because in orbit the gravitational force and the centrifugal force balance each other out. As a result, spacecraft in orbit continue to stay in orbit, and people inside or outside such craft continuously experience weightlessness.

Objects in LEO orbit Earth between the denser part of the atmosphere and below the inner Van Allen radiation belt. They encounter atmospheric drag from gases in the thermosphere (approximately 80–600 km above the surface) or exosphere (approximately and higher), depending on orbit height. Satellites in orbits that reach altitudes below decay quickly due to atmospheric drag. 

Equatorial low Earth orbits (ELEO) are a subset of LEO. These orbits, with low orbital inclination, allow rapid revisit times over low-latitude locations on Earth. Prograde equatorial LEOs also have lower delta-v launch requirements because they take advantage of the Earth&#x27;s rotation. Other useful LEO orbits including polar orbits and Sun-synchronous orbits have a higher inclinations to the equator and provide coverage for higher latitudes on Earth. Some of the first generation of Starlink satellites used polar orbits which provide coverage everywhere on Earth. Later Starlink constellations orbit at a lower inclination and provide more coverage for populated areas.

Higher orbits include medium Earth orbit (MEO), sometimes called intermediate circular orbit (ICO), and further above, geostationary orbit (GEO). Orbits higher than low orbit can lead to early failure of electronic components due to intense radiation and charge accumulation.

In 2017, &quot;very low Earth orbits&quot; (VLEO) began to be seen in regulatory filings. These orbits, below about , require the use of novel technologies for orbit raising because they operate in orbits that would ordinarily decay too soon to be economically useful.

==Use==
A low Earth orbit requires the lowest amount of energy for satellite placement. It provides high bandwidth and low communication latency. Satellites and space stations in LEO are more accessible for crew and servicing.

Since it requires less energy to place a satellite into a LEO, and a satellite there needs less powerful amplifiers for successful transmission, LEO is used for many communication applications, such as the Iridium phone system. Some communication satellites use much higher geostationary orbits and move at the same angular velocity as the Earth as to appear stationary above one location on the planet.

=== Disadvantages ===
Unlike geosynchronous satellites, satellites in low orbit have a small field of view and can only observe and communicate with a fraction of the Earth at a given time. This means that a large network (or constellation) of satellites is required to provide continuous coverage.

Satellites at lower altitudes of orbit are in the atmosphere and suffer from rapid orbital decay, requiring either periodic re-boosting to maintain stable orbits, or the launching of replacements for those that re-enter the atmosphere. The effects of adding such quantities of vaporized metals to Earth&#x27;s stratosphere are potentially of concern but currently unknown.

===Examples===
* The International Space Station is in LEO about above the Earth&#x27;s surface. The station’s orbit decays by about and consequently needs re-boosting a few times a year.
* The Iridium telecom satellites orbit at about .
* Earth observation satellites, also known as remote sensing satellites, including spy satellites and other Earth imaging satellites, use LEO as they are able to see the surface of the Earth more clearly by being closer to it. A majority of artificial satellites are placed in LEO. Satellites can also take advantage of consistent lighting of the surface below via Sun-synchronous LEO orbits at an altitude of about and near polar inclination. Envisat (2002–2012) is one example.
* The Hubble Space Telescope orbits at about above Earth.
* Satellite internet constellations such as Starlink.
* The Chinese Tiangong space station was launched in April 2021 and currently orbits between above the Earth&#x27;s surface. 
* The gravimetry mission GRACE-FO orbits at about as did its predecessor, GRACE.

==== Former ====

* GOCE (2009-2013), an ESA gravimetry mission, orbited at about 255 km (158 mi).

* Super Low Altitude Test Satellite (2017-2019), nicknamed &quot;Tsubame&quot;, orbited at , the lowest altitude ever among Earth observation satellites.

==== In fiction ====
* In the film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, Earth&#x27;s transit station (&quot;Space Station V&quot;) &quot;orbited 300 km above Earth&quot;.

==Space debris==

The LEO environment is becoming congested with space debris because of the frequency of object launches. This has caused growing concern in recent years, since collisions at orbital velocities can be dangerous or deadly. Collisions can produce additional space debris, creating a domino effect known as Kessler syndrome. NASA&#x27;s Orbital Debris Program tracks over 25,000 objects larger than 10 cm diameter in LEO, while the estimated number between 1 and 10 cm is 500,000, and the number of particles bigger than 1 mm exceeds 100 million. The particles travel at speeds up to , so even a small impact can severely damage a spacecraft.

<text>The Appian Way (Latin and Italian: Via Appia) is one of the earliest and strategically most important Roman roads of the ancient republic. It connected Rome to Brindisi, in southeast Italy. Its importance is indicated by its common name, recorded by Statius, of (&#x27;the Appian Way, the queen of the long roads&#x27;). The road is named after Appius Claudius Caecus, the Roman censor who, during the Samnite Wars, began and completed the first section as a military road to the south in 312 BC.

In July 2024, the Appian Way entered the UNESCO World Heritage List.

== Origins ==
=== The need for roads ===
The Appian Way was a Roman road which the republic used as a main route for military supplies for its conquest of southern Italy in 312 BC and for improvements in communication.

The Appian Way was the first long road built specifically to transport troops outside the smaller region of greater Rome (this was essential to the Romans). The few roads outside the early city were Etruscan and went mainly to Etruria. By the late Republic, the Romans had expanded over most of Italy and were masters of road construction. Their roads began at Rome, where the master , or list of destinations along the roads, was located, and extended to the borders of their domain – hence the expression, &quot;&quot;.

=== The Samnite Wars ===

Romans had an affinity for the people of Campania, who, like themselves, traced their backgrounds to the Etruscans. The Samnite Wars were instigated by the Samnites when Rome attempted to ally itself with the city of Capua in Campania. The Italic speakers in Latium had long ago been subdued and incorporated into the Roman state. They were responsible for changing Rome from a primarily Etruscan to a primarily Italic state.

Dense populations of sovereign Samnites remained in the mountains north of Capua, which is just north of the Greek city of Neapolis. Around 343 BC, Rome and Capua attempted to form an alliance. The Samnites reacted with military force.

=== The barrier of the Pontine Marshes ===


Between Capua and Rome lay the Pontine Marshes (&quot;Pomptinae paludes&quot;), a swamp infested with malaria. A tortuous coastal road wound between Ostia at the mouth of the Tiber and Neapolis. The Via Latina followed its ancient and scarcely more accessible path along the foothills of Monti Laziali and Monti Lepini, which are visible towering over the former marsh.

In the First Samnite War (343–341 BC) the Romans found they could not support or resupply troops in the field against the Samnites across the marsh. A revolt of the Latin League drained their resources further. They gave up the attempted alliance and settled with Samnium.

=== Colonization to the southeast ===
The Romans were only biding their time while they looked for a solution. The first answer was the colonia, a &quot;cultivation&quot; of settlers from Rome, who would maintain a permanent base of operations. The Second Samnite War (327–304 BC) erupted when Rome attempted to place a colony at Cales in 334 BC and again at Fregellae in 328 BC on the other side of the marshes. The Samnites, now a major power after defeating the Greeks of Tarentum, occupied Neapolis to try to ensure its loyalty. The Neapolitans appealed to Rome, which sent an army and expelled the Samnites from Neapolis.

=== Appius Claudius&#x27; beginning of the works ===
In 312 BC, Appius Claudius Caecus became censor at Rome. He was of the gens Claudia, who were patricians descended from the Sabines taken into the early Roman state. He had been given the name of the founding ancestor of the gens, Appius Claudius (Attus Clausus in Sabine). He was a populist, i.e., an advocate of the common people. A man of discernment and perception, in the years of success he was said to have lost his outer vision and thus acquired the name , &#x27;blind&#x27;.

Without waiting to be told what to do by the Senate, Appius Claudius began bold public works to address the supply problem. An aqueduct (the Aqua Appia) secured the water supply of the city of Rome. By far the best known project was the road, which ran across the Pontine Marshes to the coast northwest of Naples, where it turned north to Capua. On it, any number of fresh troops could be sped to the theatre of operations, and supplies could be moved en masse to Roman bases without hindrance by either enemy or terrain. It is no surprise that, after his term as censor, Appius Claudius became consul twice, subsequently held other offices, and was a respected consultant to the state even during his later years.

=== Success of the road ===
The road achieved its purpose. The outcome of the Second Samnite War was at last favorable to Rome. In a series of blows the Romans reversed their fortunes, bringing Etruria to the table in 311 BC, the very year of their revolt, and Samnium in 304 BC. The road was the main factor that allowed them to concentrate their forces with sufficient rapidity and to keep them adequately supplied, whereafter they became a formidable opponent.

== Construction ==

The main part of the Appian Way was started and finished in 312 BC.

The road began as a leveled dirt road upon which small stones and mortar were laid. Gravel was laid upon this, which was finally topped with tight fitting, interlocking stones to provide a flat surface. The historian Procopius said that the stones fit together so securely and closely that they appeared to have grown together rather than to have been fitted together. The road was cambered in the middle (for water runoff) and had ditches on either side of the road which were protected by retaining walls.

=== Between Rome and Lake Albano ===
The road began in the Forum Romanum, passed through the Servian Wall at the porta Capena, went through a cutting in the clivus Martis, and left the city. For this stretch of the road, the builders used the Via Latina. The building of the Aurelian Wall centuries later required the placing of another gate, the Porta Appia. Outside of Rome the new Via Appia went through well-to-do suburbs along the Via Norba, the ancient track to the Alban hills, where Norba was situated. The road at the time was a via glarea, a gravel road. The Romans built a high-quality road, with layers of cemented stone over a layer of small stones, cambered, drainage ditches on either side, low retaining walls on sunken portions, and dirt pathways for sidewalks. The Via Appia is believed to have been the first Roman road to feature the use of lime cement. The materials were volcanic rock. The surface was said to have been so smooth that you could not distinguish the joints. The Roman section still exists and is lined with monuments of all periods, although the cement has eroded out of the joints, leaving a very rough surface.

=== Across the marsh ===
The road concedes nothing to the Alban hills, but goes straight through them over cuts and fills. The gradients are steep. Then it enters the former Pontine Marshes. A stone causeway of about led across stagnant and foul-smelling pools blocked from the sea by sand dunes. Appius Claudius planned to drain the marsh, taking up earlier attempts, but he failed. The causeway and its bridges subsequently needed constant repair. In 162 BC, Marcus Cornelius Cathegus had a canal constructed along the road to relieve the traffic and provide an alternative when the road was being repaired. Romans preferred using the canal.

=== Along the coast ===
The Via Appia picked up the coastal road at Tarracina (Terracina). However, the Romans straightened it somewhat with cuttings, which form cliffs today. From there the road swerved north to Capua, where, for the time being, it ended. The Caudine Forks were not far to the north. The itinerary was Aricia (Ariccia), Tres Tabernae, Forum Appii, Tarracina, Fundi (Fondi), Formiae (Formia), Minturnae (Minturno), Suessa, Casilinum and Capua, but some of these were colonies added after the Samnite Wars. The distance was . The original road had no milestones, as they were not yet in use. A few survive from later times, including a first milestone near the Porta Appia.

=== Extension to Beneventum ===
The Third Samnite War (298–290 BC) is perhaps misnamed. It was an all-out attempt by all the neighbors of Rome: Italics, Etruscans and Gauls, to check the power of Rome. The Samnites were the leading people of the conspiracy. Rome dealt the northerners a crushing blow at the Battle of Sentinum in Umbria in 295. The Samnites fought on alone. Rome now placed 13 colonies in Campania and Samnium. It must have been during this time that they extended the Via Appia 35 miles beyond Capua past the Caudine Forks to a place the Samnites called Maloenton, &quot;passage of the flocks&quot;. The itinerary added Calatia, Caudium and Beneventum (not yet called that). Here also ended the Via Latina.

=== Extension to Apulia and Calabria ===
By 290 BC, the sovereignty of the Samnites had ended. The heel of Italy lay open to the Romans. The dates are somewhat uncertain and there is considerable variation in the sources, but during the Third Samnite War the Romans seem to have extended the road to Venusia, where they placed a colony of 20,000 men. After that they were at Tarentum.

Roman expansion alarmed Tarentum, the leading city of the Greek presence (Magna Graecia) in southern Italy. They hired the mercenary King Pyrrhus of Epirus in neighboring Greece to fight the Romans on their behalf. In 280 BC the Romans suffered a defeat at the hands of Pyrrhus at the Battle of Heraclea on the coast west of Tarentum. The battle was costly for both sides, prompting Pyrrhus to remark &quot;One more such victory and I am lost.&quot; Making the best of it, the Roman army turned on Greek Rhegium and effected a massacre of Pyrrhian partisans there.

Rather than pursue them, Pyrrhus went straight for Rome along the Via Appia and then the Via Latina. He knew that if he continued on the Via Appia he could be trapped in the marsh. Wary of such entrapment on the Via Latina also, he withdrew without fighting after encountering opposition at Anagni. Wintering in Campania, he withdrew to Apulia in 279 BC, where, pursued by the Romans, he won a second costly victory at the Battle of Asculum. Withdrawing from Apulia for a Sicilian interlude, he returned to Apulia in 275 BC and started for Campania up the Roman road.

Supplied by that same road, the Romans successfully defended the region against Pyrrhus, crushing his army in a two-day fight at the Battle of Beneventum in 275 BC. The Romans renamed the town from &quot;Maleventum&quot; (&quot;site of bad events&quot;) to Beneventum (&quot;site of good events&quot;) as a result. Pyrrhus withdrew to Greece, where he died in a street fight in Argos in 272 BC. Tarentum fell to the Romans that same year, who proceeded to consolidate their rule over all of Italy.

The Romans pushed the Via Appia to the port of Brundisium in 264 BC. The itinerary from Beneventum was now Aeculanum, , Venusia, Silvium, Tarentum, Uria and Brundisium. The Roman Republic was the government of Italy, for the time being. Appius Claudius died in 273, but in extending the road a number of times, no one has tried to displace his name upon it.

==== Rediscovery ====
The Appian Way&#x27;s path across today&#x27;s regions Lazio and Campania has always been well known, but the exact position of the part located in Apulia (the original one, not the extension by Trajan) was long unknown, since there were no visible remains of the Appian Way in that region.

In the first half of the 20th century, the professor of ancient Roman topography Giuseppe Lugli managed to discover, with the then-innovative technique of photogrammetry, what probably was the route of the Appian Way from Gravina in Puglia (&quot;Silvium&quot;) up to Taranto. When analysing aerophotogrammetric shots of the area, Lugli noticed a path () named &quot;la Tarantina&quot;, whose direction was still largely influenced by the centuriation; this, according to Lugli, was the path of the Appian Way. This path, as well as the part located in today&#x27;s Apulia region, was still in use in the Middle Ages. A further piece of evidence for Lugli&#x27;s proposed path is the presence of a number of archaeological remains in that region, among them the ancient settlement of Jesce.

By studying the distances given in the Antonine Itinerary, Lugli also assigned the Appian Way stations &quot;Blera&quot; and &quot;Sublupatia&quot; (which also occurs on the &quot;Tabula Peutingeriana&quot;) respectively to the areas &quot;Murgia Catena&quot; and &quot;Taverna&quot; (between masseria (estate farmhouse) S. Filippo and masseria S. Pietro). However, the toponym &quot;Murgia Catena&quot; defined too large an area, not allowing a clear localization of the Appian Way station. More recently Luciano Piepoli, based on the distances given in the Antonine Itinerary and on newer archeological findings, has suggested that &quot;Silvium&quot; should be &quot;Santo Staso&quot;, an area very close to Gravina in Puglia, &quot;Blera&quot; should be &quot;masseria Castello&quot;, and &quot;Sublupatia&quot; should be &quot;masseria Caione&quot;.

=== Main branches ===
Since the latter stretch of the Appian Way turned out to be very impervious, some branches were created: first the , then the , finally the emperor Trajan built the Via Traiana, a branch of the Via Appia from Beneventum, reaching Brundisium via Canusium and Barium rather than via Tarentum. This was commemorated by an arch at Beneventum.

Travellers could cross the Adriatic Sea through the Otranto Strait towards Albania either by landing at present day Durrës through the Via Egnatia or near the ancient town of Apollonia and continue towards present day Rrogozhinë in central Albania.

== Notable historical events along the road ==

=== Crucifixion of Spartacus&#x27;s army ===

In 73 BC, a slave revolt (known as the Third Servile War) under the ex-gladiator of Capua, Spartacus, began against the Romans. Slaves accounted for roughly every third person in Italy.

Spartacus defeated many Roman armies in a conflict that lasted for over two years. While trying to escape from Italy at Brundisium he unwittingly moved his forces into the historic trap at Apulia in Calabria. The Romans were well acquainted with the region. Legions were brought home from abroad and Spartacus was pinned between armies. The ex-slave army was defeated at the Siler River by Marcus Licinius Crassus. Pompey&#x27;s armies captured and killed several thousand rebels that escaped from the battle and Crassus captured several thousand more. The Romans judged that the slaves had forfeited their right to live. In 71 BC, 6,000 slaves were crucified along the Via Appia from Rome to Capua.

=== World War II, Battle of Anzio ===

In 1943, during World War II, the Allies fell into the same trap Pyrrhus had retreated to avoid, in the Pomptine fields, the successor to the Pontine Marshes. The marsh remained, despite many efforts to drain it, until engineers working for Benito Mussolini finally succeeded (even so, the fields were infested with malarial mosquitos until the advent of DDT in the 1950s).

Hoping to break a stalemate at Monte Cassino, the Allies landed on the coast of Italy at the Anzio-Nettuno area – ancient Antium – which was midway between Ostia and Terracina. They found that the place was undefended. They intended to move along the line of the Via Appia to take Rome, outflanking Monte Cassino, but they did not do so quickly enough. The Germans occupied Mounts Laziali and Lepini along the track of the old Via Latina, from which they rained down shells on Anzio. Even though the Allies expanded into all the Pomptine region, they gained no ground. The Germans counterattacked down the via Appia from the Alban hills in a front four miles wide, but could not retake Anzio. The battle lasted for four months, one side being supplied by sea, the other by land through Rome. In May 1944, the Allies broke out of Anzio and took Rome. The German forces escaped to the north of Florence.

===1960 Summer Olympics===
During the 1960 Summer Olympics, the Via Appia was part of the course of the men&#x27;s marathon. The event was won by Abebe Bikila of Ethiopia.

== Main sights ==

=== Via Appia Antica ===
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the road fell out of use; Pope Pius VI ordered its restoration. A new Appian Way was built in parallel with the old one in 1784 as far as the Alban Hills region. The new road is the Via Appia Nuova (&#x27;New Appian Way&#x27;) as opposed to the old section, now known as Via Appia Antica. The old Appian Way close to Rome is now a free tourist attraction. It was extensively restored for Rome&#x27;s Millennium and Great Jubilee celebrations. The first are still heavily used by cars, buses and coaches but from then on traffic is very light and the ruins can be explored on foot in relative safety. The Church of Domine Quo Vadis is in the second mile of the road. Along or close to the part of the road closest to Rome, there are three catacombs of Roman and early Christian origin and one of Jewish origin.

The construction of Rome&#x27;s ring road, the Grande Raccordo Anulare or GRA, in 1951 caused the Appian Way to be cut in two. More recent improvements to the GRA have rectified this through the construction of a tunnel under the Appia, so that it is now possible to follow the Appia on foot for about from its beginning near the Baths of Caracalla.

Many parts of the original road beyond Rome&#x27;s environs have been preserved, and some are now used by cars (for example, in the area of Velletri). The road inspires the last movement of Ottorino Respighi&#x27;s &quot;Pini di Roma&quot;. To this day the Via Appia contains the longest stretch of straight road in Europe, totaling .

<text>The American pickerel (&quot;Esox americanus&quot;) is a medium-sized species of North American freshwater predatory fish belonging to the pike family. The genus &quot;Esox&quot; is placed in family Esocidae in order Esociformes). 

Two subspecies are sometimes recognised:
* [[Redfin pickerel]], sometimes called the brook pickerel, &quot;E. americanus americanus&quot; Gmelin, 1789;
* Grass pickerel, &quot;E. americanus vermiculatus&quot; Lesueur, 1846.

Lesueur originally classified the grass pickerel as &quot;E. vermiculatus,&quot; but it is now considered a subspecies of &quot;E. americanus.&quot;

There is no widely accepted English common collective name for the two &quot;E. americanus&quot; subspecies; &quot;American pickerel&quot; is a translation of the French systematic name &quot;brochet d&#x27;Amérique.&quot;

== Description ==
The two subspecies are very similar, but the grass pickerel lacks the redfin&#x27;s distinctive orange to red fin coloration. The former&#x27;s fins have dark leading edges and amber to dusky coloration. In addition, the light areas between the dark bands are generally wider on the grass pickerel and narrower on the redfin pickerel. Record size grass and redfin pickerels can weigh around and reach lengths of around . Redfin and grass pickerels are typically smaller than chain pickerels, which can be much larger.

== Distribution and habitats ==
The redfin and grass pickerels occur primarily in sluggish, vegetated waters of pools, lakes and wetlands, and are carnivorous predators feeding on smaller fish. However, larger fishes, such as the striped bass (&quot;Morone saxatilis&quot;), bowfin (&quot;Amia calva&quot;) and gray weakfish (&quot;Cynoscion regalis&quot;), prey on the pickerels in turn when the latter venture into larger rivers or estuaries.

The pickerels reproduce by scattering spherical, sticky eggs in shallow, heavily vegetated waters. The eggs hatch in 11–15 days; the adult pickerels guard neither the eggs nor the young.

Both subspecies are native to the freshwater bodies of North America, and are not to be confused with their more aggressive big cousin, the northern pike. The redfin pickerel&#x27;s range extends from the Saint Lawrence basin in Quebec down to the Gulf Coast, from Mississippi to Florida; while the grass pickerel&#x27;s range is further west, extending from the Great Lakes Basin, from Ontario to Michigan, down to the western Gulf Coast, from eastern Texas to Mississippi.

== Fishing ==
The &quot;E. americanus&quot; subspecies are not as highly prized as a game fish as their larger cousins, the northern pike and muskellunge, but they are nevertheless caught by anglers. &quot;McClane&#x27;s Standard Fishing Encyclopedia&quot; describes ultralight tackle as a sporty if overlooked method to catch these small but voracious pikes.

<text>Porgy is a novel written by the American author DuBose Heyward and published by the George H. Doran Company in 1925.

The novel tells the story of Porgy, a disabled street beggar living in the black tenements of Charleston, South Carolina, in the 1920s. The character was based on Charlestonian Samuel Smalls. In some of the novel&#x27;s passages, black characters speak in Gullah, a creole language that had developed among enslaved African Americans during the slavery years on the Sea Islands.

The novel was adapted for a 1927 play of the same name by Heyward and his wife, playwright Dorothy Heyward. Even before completing the play, Heyward was in discussions with composer George Gershwin for an operatic version of his novel. This was produced in 1935 as &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; (renamed to distinguish it from the play).

<text>Cynoscion regalis, the weakfish, is a marine ray-finned fish of the family Sciaenidae, the drums and croakers.

A medium-large, slender, marine fish, it is found along the east coast of North America. The head and back of this fish are dark brown in color with a greenish tinge. The sides have a faint silvery hue with dusky specks, and the belly is white. The origin of its name is based on the weakness of the mouth muscles, which often cause a hook to tear free, allowing the fish to escape. The weakfish grows to in length and in weight. It is found along the eastern coast of North America from Nova Scotia, Canada to northern Florida, where it is fished both commercially and recreationally.

This species has become established in the Gulf of Cadiz in the eastern Atlantic. This introduced population was first noted in 2011 when a specimen misidentified as &quot;Cynoscion nebulosus&quot; was taken and there is now a well established population.

The weakfish is the state fish of Delaware.

==Names==
&quot;Cynoscion regalis&quot; is also known as bastard trout, bastard weakfish, chickwick, common weakfish, gray trout, gray sea trout, gray weakfish, saltwater trout, and squeteague.

==Management==
&quot;Cynoscion regalis&quot; stocks have been generally low in recent years due to fishing and natural mortality increasing. Management of the species includes gear regulations, seasonal fishing, bycatch limitations, minimum size limits, commercial creel limits, and bycatch reduction gear. It is hoped that these regulations incorporated with others will help weakfish populations come back to a sustainable point.

==Appearance==
&quot;Cynoscion regalis&quot; is a salt-water fish native to the mid Atlantic region of the east coast of the United States. Ranging from 12-18 inches once fully matured, with some adults reaching well above this range at up to 3 feet and 18 lbs. The weakfish can live up to 17 years but have an average lifespan of 9 to 12 years (Chesapeake).

==Diet==
&quot;Cynoscion regalis&quot; preys on a wide variety of species, including, small schooling fish like anchovies and Atlantic Menhaden, assorted crabs, shrimp, mollusks, and even large zooplankton. Weakfish move toward their prey slowly and once upon them they attack aggressively with an open jaw (Chesapeake).
Although being a predatory fish and on a higher trophic level the weakfish are also a food source for other larger fish. Some examples of fish that prey on weakfish include the bluefish, the striped bass, and the dusky shark (Chesapeake).
==Breeding==
&quot;Cynoscion regalis&quot; mainly spawn from April to August. This spawning takes place in the shallow waters of estuaries. Their young are in the form of zooplankton, floating freely with the tidal current. They flow with these currents until reaching their nursery area of low salinity rivers. Once these fish grow large enough in these areas, they begin to migrate back to the saltier waters to which they were spawned. They stay in these intertidal bay zone until winter, then join the schooling fish towards deeper offshore waters. The males have the ability to perform a deep croaking sound as shown by the Chesapeake Bay field guide (Chesapeake). The reason why these fish have the capability to do this is because they are a part of the drum family. This trait is very common in species that belong to the drum family and is commonly used for mating purposes. It is believed that weakfish also use this to attract other females as stated in a study done at the University of Michigan, &quot;There is some evidence that the male weakfish croaking sound may be used in attracting a mate and playing a role in the spawning behavior. This is because the male&#x27;s sonic muscles, which are used to produce &#x27;drumming&#x27; and &#x27;croaking&#x27; sounds, increases three times its usual mass during spawning season&quot; (Gillum). This study shows that weakfish make use of their drum sound more frequently during the mating season, suggesting that it is used as a process for males to attract females.

==Behavior==
&quot;Cynoscion regalis&quot; are schooling fish, meaning that they spend a large majority of their time swimming together either trying to evade larger predators, or trying to feed more efficiently on prey. Studies done by the university of Michigan state that these schooling patterns tend to become much tighter in signs of stress as they state, &quot;weakfish have an acute chemosensory response mechanism. In times of stress, weakfish gather into tighter schools, this was seen in lab studies when higher temperatures were used. The weakfish under these conditions showed a 35% decrease in their distance to the other fish in the school. Also the frequency of school formation increased in response to stress&quot; (Gillum). Weakfish school closer together when in situations of high stress in this study done by the university of Michigan. Theorizing that they use schooling as a form of protection. 
==Economic importance==
&quot;Cynoscion regalis&quot; is excellent table fare; they can be used as a food source. The weakfish are recreationally fished and provide tackle shops with business. 
==Recreational fishing==
&quot;Cynoscion regalis&quot; are finicky. They are very shy and prey selective; making them a harder fish to target recreationally, this provides a good challenge for anglers. They prefer a water temperature ranging from 50 degree F to 65 degrees F. This is the best time to target weakfish, as they are most actively breeding within these temperatures. They can be found feeding in temperatures exclusive to these numbers, but they may be much more finicky and hard to hook. The weakfish also have a very fragile mouth, making it hard for anglers to keep them from spitting the hook.

==Conservation==
&quot;Cynoscion regalis&quot; has its main breeding grounds in the near shore estuaries of the Chesapeake Bay. &quot;The most important habitat for the weakfish is the brackish waters of the Chesapeake bay&quot; (Gillum). This is where the vast majority of weakfish breed, to maintain a healthy population of weakfish these areas must be preserved. The weakfish experienced a crash that was recognized in 2009 as stated by John McMurray in the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, &quot;A 2009 stock assessment found that weakfish were badly depleted. The stock had reached an all-time low of 2.9 million pounds, far below the &quot;biomass threshold&quot; of 22.4 million pounds, which is what scientists would consider a healthy stock. This is an astonishing drop, since the East Coast harvest in 1980 was 80 million pounds&quot; (McMurray).

Natural mortality of this species has increased since the mid 1990s from 0.16 to an average of 0.93 from 2007 to 2014 but the underlying cause is still unknown. Given the decline in SSB in excess of 60% over three generation lengths and the unknown driver of increasing natural mortality, this species is listed as Endangered A2b with an urgent need for additional research to determine the driver of increasing natural mortality.

==Current fishing regulations==
&quot;Cynoscion regalis&quot; is a target for the recreational anglers and each individual state has its own size limit, possession limit, and season for targeting and collecting weakfish. For example, in the state of New Jersey, recreational anglers are allowed 1 fish that is greater than 13 inches at any time of the year as shown by the New Jersey Department of Environmental protection (NJ wildlife). Under Florida regulations weakfish are considered partially regulated, but there is a 100 lbs limit of unregulated fish including sand seatrout and silver seatrout per day outside of the Weakfish Management Zone. The Weakfish Management Zone includes state waters from the Florida-Georgia line to the southernmost tip of Amelia Island, the inland waters of Nassau County and the St. Marys River. The regulations in the zone are to protect mainly the purebred weakfish, as they are relatively rare in Florida outside of this zone. Sand seatrout and silver seatrout are species of least concern.

==In human culture==
&quot;Cynoscion regalis&quot; is the state fish of Delaware.

<text>The striped bass (Morone saxatilis), also called the Atlantic striped bass, striper, linesider, rock, or rockfish, is an anadromous perciform fish of the family Moronidae found primarily along the Atlantic coast of North America. It has also been widely introduced into inland recreational fisheries across the United States. Striped bass found in the Gulf of Mexico are a separate strain referred to as Gulf Coast striped bass.

The striped bass is the state fish of Maryland, Rhode Island, and South Carolina, and the state saltwater (marine) fish of New York, New Jersey, Virginia, and New Hampshire. It is generally called the striped bass north of New Jersey, rockfish south of New Jersey, and both in New Jersey.

The history of the striped bass fishery in North America dates back to the Colonial period. Many written accounts by some of the first European settlers describe the immense abundance of striped bass, along with alewives, traveling and spawning up most rivers in the coastal Northeast.

== Morphology and lifespan ==
The striped bass is a typical member of the family Moronidae in shape, having a streamlined, silvery body marked with longitudinal dark stripes running from behind the gills to the base of the tail. Common mature size is . The largest specimen recorded was , netted in 1896. Striped bass are believed to live for up to 30 years. The average size in length is and approximately , but varies based on the fish&#x27;s age and sex.

==Distribution==
===Natural distribution===
Striped bass are native to the Atlantic coastline of North America from the St. Lawrence River into the Gulf of Mexico to Louisiana. They are anadromous fish that migrate between fresh and salt water. Spawning takes place in fresh water.

===Introductions outside their natural range===
Striped bass have been introduced to the Pacific Coast of North America and into many large reservoir impoundments across the United States by state game and fish commissions for recreational fishing and as a predator to control populations of gizzard shad. These include: Elephant Butte Lake in New Mexico; Lake Ouachita, Lake Norman in North Carolina; Lake Norfork, Beaver Lake and Lake Hamilton in Arkansas; Lake Thunderbird in Illinois; Lake Pleasant, and Lake Havasu in Arizona; Lake Powell along the Arizona/Utah border; Castaic Lake, Pyramid Lake, Silverwood Lake, Diamond Valley Lake, and San Francisco Bay-Delta in California; Lewis Smith Lake in Alabama; Lake Cumberland in Kentucky; Lake George in Florida; Lake Murray in South Carolina; Lake Lanier in Georgia; Watts Bar Lake, in Tennessee; Lake Mead, Nevada; Lake Texoma on the border of Texas and Oklahoma, Lake Tawakoni, Lake Whitney, Buffalo Springs Lake, Possum Kingdom Lake, and Lake Buchanan in Texas; Raystown Lake in Pennsylvania; Lake Wallenpaupack in Northeastern Pennsylvania; Umpqua River in Oregon and in Virginia&#x27;s Smith Mountain Lake and Leesville Reservoir.

Striped bass have also been introduced into waters in Ecuador, Iran, Latvia, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and Turkey, primarily for sport fishing and aquaculture.

==Environmental factors==
The spawning success of striped bass has been studied in the San Francisco Bay-Delta water system, with a finding that high total dissolved solids (TDS) reduce spawning. At levels as low as 200 mg/L TDS, an observable diminution of spawning productivity occurs. They can be found in lakes, ponds, streams, and wetlands.

Though the population of striped bass was growing and repopulating in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, a study executed by the Wildlife and Fisheries Program at West Virginia University found that the rapid growth of the striped bass population was exerting a tremendous pressure on its prey (river herring, shad, and blueback herring). This pressure on their food source was putting their own population at risk due to the population of prey naturally not coming back to the same spawning areas.

In the United States, the striped bass was designated as a protected game fish in 2007, and executive agencies were directed to use existing legal authorities to prohibit the sale of striped bass caught in federal waters in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. In addition, Connecticut, Maine, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina have designated striped bass as a game fish in state waters.

In Canada, the province of Quebec designated the striped bass population of the Saint Lawrence as extirpated in 1996. Analysis of available data implicated overfishing and dredging in the disappearance. In 2002, a reintroduction program was successful.

== Life cycle ==

Striped bass spawn in fresh water, and although they have been successfully adapted to freshwater habitat, they naturally spend their adult lives in saltwater (i.e., they are anadromous). Five important bodies of water with breeding stocks of striped bass are: Miramichi River, Chesapeake Bay, Massachusetts Bay/Cape Cod, Hudson River, and Delaware River. Many of the rivers and tributaries that emptied into the Atlantic, had at one time, bred stock of striped bass. This occurred until the 1860s. One of the largest breeding areas is the Chesapeake Bay, where populations from Chesapeake and Delaware bays have intermingled. The very few successful spawning populations of freshwater striped bass include Lake Texoma, Lake Weiss (Coosa River), the Colorado River and its reservoirs downstream from and including Lake Powell, and the Arkansas River, as well as Lake Marion (South Carolina) that retained a landlocked breeding population when the dam was built; other freshwater fisheries must be restocked with hatchery-produced fish annually. Stocking of striped bass was discontinued at Lake Mead in 1973 once natural reproduction was verified.

==Hybrids with other bass==
Striped bass have also been hybridized with white bass to produce hybrid striped bass also known as wiper, whiterock bass, sunshine bass, palmetto bass, and Cherokee bass. These hybrids have been stocked in many freshwater areas across the US.

== Fishing for striped bass ==

Striped bass are of significant value for sport fishing, and have been introduced to many waterways outside their natural range. A variety of angling methods are used, including trolling and surf casting. Lures such as wooden plugs, plastic swimmers, poppers, and metal spoons all work very well for fishing off of the surf. Using live and dead bait can also be a deadly technique when targeting Striped bass from land. Striped bass take a number of live and fresh baits, including bunker, clams, eels, sandworms, herring, bloodworms, mackerel, shad, bluegill, and crayfish.

The largest striped bass ever taken by angling was an specimen taken from a boat in Long Island Sound, near the Outer Southwest Reef, off the coast of Westbrook, Connecticut. The all-tackle world record fish was taken by Gregory Myerson on the night of August 4, 2011. The fish took a drifted live eel bait, and fought for 20 minutes before being boated by Myerson. A second hook and leader was discovered in the fish&#x27;s mouth when it was boated, indicating it had been previously hooked by another angler. The fish measured 54 in long and had a girth of 36 in. The International Game Fish Association (IGFA) declared Myerson&#x27;s catch the new all-tackle world record striped bass on October 19, 2011. In addition to now holding the all-tackle record, Meyerson&#x27;s catch also landed him the new IGFA men&#x27;s 37 kg (80 -lb) line class record for striped bass, which previously stood at 70 lb. The previous all-tackle world record fish was a specimen taken in Atlantic City, New Jersey, on September 21, 1982, by Albert McReynolds, who fought the fish from the beach for an hour and 20 minutes after it took his Rebel artificial lure. On March 20, 2023, then 12-year-old Henry Bulgin set the first Junior IGFA All-Tackle Length world record by landing a striped bass while fishing the Chesapeake Bay just south of Annapolis, Maryland, but this was beaten by the end of that year by a specimen in the same bay, just off Virginia. Recreational bag limits vary by state and province. On July 4, 2008, David Hochman shot a 68.4 lb specimen off the coast of Rhode Island to set the world record for Striped Bass taken by speargun.

== Landlocked striped bass ==

Striped bass are anadromous, so their upriver spawning migrations led some individuals to become &quot;landlocked&quot; during lake dam constructions. The first area where this was documented was at the Santee-Cooper River during the construction of the two dams that impounded Lakes Moultrie and Marion, and because of this, the state game fish of South Carolina is the striped bass.

Recently, biologists came to believe that striped bass stayed in rivers for long periods of time, with some not returning to sea unless temperature changes forced migration. Once fishermen and biologists caught on to rising striped bass populations, many state natural resources departments started stocking striped bass in local lakes. Striped bass still continue to exhibit upstream migrations from freshwater lakes during the spawning period. Landlocked stripers have a hard time reproducing naturally, and one of the few and most successful rivers in which they have been documented reproducing successfully is the Coosa River in Alabama and Georgia.

A landlocked bass was caught in February 2013 by James R. Bramlett on the Warrior River in Alabama, a current world record. This fish had a length of and a girth of .

A self-sustaining population of striped bass also exist in Lake Texoma, a brackish lake.
In Canada there are no landlocked striped bass, but a large number of bass overwinter in Grand Lake, Nova Scotia. They migrate out in early April into the Shubenacadie River to spawn. These bass also spawn in the Stewiacke River (a tributary of the Shubenacadie). The Shubenacadie River system is one of five known spawning areas in Canada for striped bass, with the others being the St. Lawerence River, Miramichi River, Saint John River, Annapolis River, and Shubenacadie/Stewiacke Rivers.

==Management==
The striped bass population declined to less than 5 million by 1982, but efforts by fishermen with throw back lengths for smaller striped bass and management programs to rebuild the stock proved successful, and in 2007, the nearly 56 million fish included all ages. Recreational anglers and commercial fisherman caught an unprecedented 3.8 million fish in 2006. In New Jersey, alone among states, there is no legal commercial fishery for Striped Bass, it is against the law to sell Striped Bass in wholesale markets, retail, or in restaurants. The management of the species includes size limits, commercial quotas, and biological reference points for the health of the species.

The Atlantic coast-wide harvest of striped bass is managed by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (AMSFC). In October 2019, the AMSFC announced that the 2018 Benchmark Stock Assessment indicated that &quot;the resource is overfished and experiencing overfishing.&quot; Following a series of hearings during March and April 2021 to gather public input, the ASMFC Striped Bass Technical Committee will make recommendations for a new 10-year management strategy, &quot;Amendment 7 to the Interstate Management Plan for Atlantic Striped Bass&quot;, to replenish striped bass to sustainable levels throughout its traditional migratory range from North Carolina to Maine. Amendment 7 will be finalized and adopted in late 2021 and implemented in 2022. Conditions of the Striped bass fishery have continued to get worse with Striped bass stocks nearly at the low hit all the way back in 1985. There is major controversy in the fishing community on whether this data is correct because many anglers have seen great fishing in recent years.

==Culinary use==
Striped bass has white meat with a mild flavor and a medium texture. It is extremely versatile in that it can be pan-seared, grilled, steamed, poached, roasted, broiled, sautéed, and deep fried (including batter-frying). The flesh can also be eaten raw or pickled.

The primary market forms for fresh bass include headed and gutted (with the head and organs removed) and filets; the primary market forms for frozen bass include headed and gutted and loins. It can also be found in steaks, chunks, or whole. Fresh striped bass is available year-round, and is typically sold in sizes from two to fifteen pounds, and can be sold up to fifty pounds.

Striped bass has firm and flavorful flesh with a large flake. The hybrid striped bass yields more meat, has a more fragile texture, and a blander flavor than wild striped bass. The fish has a mild and distinctive flavor. In recipes, it can be substituted for milder fish like cod, as well as for stronger fish like bluefish. Other fish can substitute it, including weakfish, tilefish, blackfish, small bluefish, catfish, salmon, swordfish, and shark. Striped bass is easily grilled in fillets, and is therefore popular in beach communities.

In Virginia, anadromous striped bass caught from the Chesapeake Bay and its small tidal tributaries have been found to be contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), leading to the issuance of a fish consumption advisory by the Virginia Department of Health.

<text>The muskellunge (Esox masquinongy), often shortened to muskie, musky, ski, or lunge, is a species of large freshwater predatory fish native to North America. It is the largest member of the pike family, Esocidae.

==Origin of name==
The name &quot;muskellunge&quot; originates from the Ojibwe words &quot;maashkinoozhe&quot; meaning &quot;great fish&quot;, &quot;mji-gnoozhe,&quot; &quot;maskinoše&quot;, or &quot;mashkinonge,&quot; meaning &quot;bad pike&quot;, &quot;big pike&quot;, or &quot;ugly pike&quot; respectively. The Algonquin word &quot;maskinunga&quot; is borrowed into the Canadian French words &quot;masquinongé&quot; or &quot;maskinongé&quot;. In English, before settling on the common name &quot;muskellunge&quot;, there were at least 94 common names applied to this species, including but not limited to: &quot;muskelunge&quot;, &quot;muscallonge&quot;, &quot;muskallonge&quot;, &quot;milliganong&quot;, &quot;maskinonge&quot;, &quot;maskalonge&quot;, &quot;mascalonge&quot;, &quot;maskalung&quot;, &quot;muskinunge&quot; and &quot;masquenongez&quot;.

==Description==

Muskellunge closely resemble other esocids such as the northern pike (&quot;Esox lucius&quot;) and American pickerel (&quot;E. americanus&quot;) in both appearance and behavior. Like the northern pike and other aggressive pikes, the body plan is typical of ambush predators with an elongated body, flat head, and dorsal, pelvic, and anal fins set far back on the body. Muskellunge are typically long and weigh , though some have reached up to and almost . Martin Arthur Williamson caught a muskellunge with a weight of in November 2000 on Georgian Bay. The fish are a light silver, brown, or green, with dark vertical stripes on the flank, which may tend to break up into spots. In some cases, markings may be absent altogether, especially in fish from turbid waters. This is in contrast to northern pike, which have dark bodies with light markings. A reliable method to distinguish the two similar species is by counting the sensory pores on the underside of the mandible. A muskie will have seven or more per side, while the northern pike never has more than six. The lobes of the caudal (tail) fin in muskellunge come to a sharper point, while those of northern pike are more generally rounded. In addition, unlike pike, muskies have no scales on the lower half of their opercula.

Anglers seek large muskies as trophies or for sport. In places where muskie are not native, such as in Maine, anglers are encouraged not to release the fish back into the water because of their negative impact on native populations of trout and other smaller fish species.

==Habitat==
Muskellunge are found in oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes and large rivers from northern Michigan, northern Wisconsin, and northern Minnesota through the Great Lakes region, Chautauqua Lake in western New York, north into Canada, throughout most of the St Lawrence River drainage, and northward throughout the upper Mississippi valley, although the species also extends as far south as Chattanooga in the Tennessee River valley. Also, a small population is found in the Broad River in South Carolina. Several North Georgia reservoirs also have healthy stocked populations of muskie. They are also found in the Red River drainage of the Hudson Bay basin. Muskie were introduced to western Saint John River in the late 1960s and have now spread to many connecting waterways in northern Maine. The Pineview Reservoir in Utah is one of three Utah locations where the hybrid Tiger muskellunge is found.

They prefer clear waters where they lurk along weed edges, rock outcrops, or other structures to rest. A fish forms two distinct home ranges in summer: a shallow range and a deeper one. The shallow range is generally much smaller than the deeper range due to shallow water heating up. A muskie continually patrols the ranges in search of available food in the appropriate conditions of water temperature.

==Diet==
Muskies are ambush predators who will swiftly bite their prey and then swallow it head first. Muskellunge are the top predator in any body of water where they occur and they will eat larger prey than most other freshwater fish. They eat all varieties of fish present in their ecosystem (including other muskellunge), along with the occasional insect, muskrat, rat, mouse, frog, or duck. They are capable of taking prey up to two-thirds of their body length due to their large stomachs. There have even been reports of large muskellunge attacking small dogs and even humans, although most of these reports are greatly exaggerated.

==Length and weight==

As muskellunge grow longer they increase in weight, but the relationship between length and weight is not linear. The relationship between them can be expressed by a power-law equation:
:formula_1

The exponent b is close to 3.0 for all species, and c is a constant for each species. For muskellunge, b = 3.325, higher than for many common species, and c = .

According to the International Game Fish Association (IGFA) the largest muskellunge on record was caught by Cal Johnson in Lac Courte Oreilles (recognized as Lake Courte Oreilles by the association), Hayward, Wisconsin, United States, on July 24, 1949. The fish weighed and was in length, and in girth.

==Behavior==

Muskellunge are sometimes gregarious, forming small schools in distinct territories. Muskellunge feeding behavior is directly synchronized with the lunar cycle. During both full and new moons, an increase in feeding activity can be attributed to the increase of moonlight, as it most similarly simulates daytime feeding. They spawn in mid- to late spring, somewhat later than northern pike, over shallow, vegetated areas. A rock or sand bottom is preferred for spawning so the eggs do not sink into the mud and suffocate. The males arrive first and attempt to establish dominance over a territory. Spawning may last from five to 10 days and occurs mainly at night. The eggs are negatively buoyant and slightly adhesive; they adhere to plants and the bottom of the lake. Soon afterward, they are abandoned by the adults. Those embryos which are not eaten by fish, insects, or crayfish hatch within two weeks. The larvae live on yolk until the mouth is fully developed, when they begin to feed on copepods and other zooplankton. They soon begin to prey upon fish. Juveniles generally attain a length of by November of their first year.

==Predators==
Adult muskellunge are apex predators where they occur naturally. Only humans and (rarely) large birds of prey such as bald eagles (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus&quot;) pose a threat to an adult. But juveniles are consumed by other muskies, northern pike, bass, trout, and occasionally birds of prey. The muskellunge&#x27;s low reproductive rate and slow growth render populations highly vulnerable to overfishing. This has prompted some jurisdictions to institute artificial propagation programs in an attempt to maintain otherwise unsustainably high rates of angling effort and habitat destruction.

==Subspecies and hybrids==
Though interbreeding with other pike species can complicate the classification of some individuals, zoologists usually recognize up to three subspecies of muskellunge.
* The Great Lakes Muskellunge or Spotted Muskellunge (&quot;E. m. masquinongy&quot;) is the most common variety in the Great Lakes basin and surrounding area. The spots on the body form oblique rows.
* The Chautauqua Muskellunge or Barred Muskellunge (&quot;E. m. ohioensis&quot;) is known from the Ohio River system, Chautauqua Lake, Lake Ontario, and the St Lawrence River.
* The Clear Muskellunge (&quot;E. m. immaculatus&quot;) is most common in the inland lakes of Wisconsin, Minnesota, northwestern Ontario, and southeastern Manitoba.

The tiger muskellunge (&quot;E. masquinongy&quot; × &quot;lucius&quot; or &quot;E. lucius&quot; × &quot;masquinongy&quot;) is a hybrid of the muskie and northern pike. Hybrids are sterile, although females sometimes unsuccessfully engage in spawning motions. Some hybrids are artificially produced and planted for anglers to catch. Tiger muskies grow faster than pure muskies, but do not attain the ultimate size of their pure relatives, as the tiger muskie does not live as long.

==Attacks on humans==
Although very rare, muskie attacks on humans do occur on occasion.

<doc id="47579" wikidata="Q5123445" url="?curid=47579" title="Pollock">
<text>Pollock or pollack (pronounced ) is the common name used for either of the two species of North Atlantic marine fish in the genus Pollachius. &quot;Pollachius pollachius&quot; is referred to as &quot;pollock&quot; in North America, Ireland and the United Kingdom, while &quot;Pollachius virens&quot; is usually known as saithe or coley in Great Britain and Ireland (derived from the older name coalfish). Other names for &quot;P. pollachius&quot; include the Atlantic pollock, European pollock, lieu jaune, and lythe or lithe; while &quot;P. virens&quot; is also known as Boston blue (distinct from bluefish), silver bill, or saithe.

== Species ==
The recognized species in this genus are:
* &quot;Pollachius pollachius&quot; (pollack)
* &quot;Pollachius virens&quot; (coalfish)

== Description ==
Both species can grow to . &quot;P. virens&quot; can weigh up to and &quot;P. pollachius&quot; can weigh up to . &quot;P. virens&quot; has a strongly defined, silvery lateral line running down the sides. Above the lateral line, the colour is a greenish black. The belly is white, while &quot;P. pollachius&quot; has a distinctly crooked lateral line, grayish to golden belly, and a dark brown back. &quot;P. pollachius&quot; also has a strong underbite. It can be found in water up to deep over rocks and anywhere in the water column.

== As food ==

Atlantic pollock is largely considered to be a whitefish. Traditionally a popular source of food in some countries, such as Norway, in the United Kingdom it has previously been largely consumed as a cheaper and versatile alternative to cod and haddock. However, in recent years, pollock has become more popular due to overfishing of cod and haddock. It can now be found in most supermarkets as fresh fillets or prepared freezer items. For example, it is used minced in fish fingers or as an ingredient in imitation crab meat and is commonly used to make fish and chips.

Because of its slightly grey colour, pollock is often prepared, as in Norway, as fried fish balls, or if juvenile-sized, breaded with oatmeal and fried, as in Shetland. Year-old fish are traditionally split, salted, and dried over a peat hearth in Orkney, where their texture becomes wooden. Coalfish can also be salted and smoked and achieve a salmon-like orange color (although it is not closely related to the salmon), as is the case in Germany, where the fish is commonly sold as &quot;Seelachs&quot; or sea salmon.
In 2009, UK supermarket Sainsbury&#x27;s briefly renamed Atlantic pollock &quot;colin&quot; in a bid to boost ecofriendly sales of the fish as an alternative to cod. Sainsbury&#x27;s, which said the new name was derived from the French for cooked pollock (&quot;colin&quot;), launched the product under the banner &quot;Colin and chips can save British cod.&quot;
Pollock is regarded as a &quot;low-mercury fish&quot; – a woman weighing can safely eat up to per week, and a child weighing can safely eat up to .

== Other fish called pollock ==

One member of the genus &quot;Gadus&quot; is also commonly referred to as pollock: the Alaska pollock or walleye pollock (&quot;Gadus chalcogrammus&quot;), including the form known as the Norway pollock. They are also members of the family Gadidae but not members of the genus &quot;Pollachius&quot;.

<doc id="47581" wikidata="Q744187" url="?curid=47581" title="Archosargus probatocephalus">
<text>Archosargus probatocephalus, the sheepshead, sheepshead seabream or convict fish, is a species of marine ray-finned fish belonging to the family Sparidae, the seabreams and porgies. This species is found in the Western Atlantic Ocean. The sheepshead is an important species to recreational and commercial fisheries.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Archosargus probatocephalus&quot; was first formally described as &quot;Sparus probatocephalus&quot; by the German physician, naturalist and taxonomist Johann Julius Walbaum with no type locality given, although it is thought to be New York. The Southern sheepshead (&quot;A. aries&quot;) is regarded as a separate valid species by some authorities, but is not recognised as such by FishBase. The genus &quot;Archosargus&quot; is placed in the family Sparidae within the order Spariformes by the 5th edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot;. Some authorities classify this genus in the subfamily Sparinae, but the 5th edition of Fishes of the World does not recognise subfamilies within the Sparidae.

==Etymology==
&quot;Archosargus probatocephalus&quot; has a specific name which compounds &quot;probaton&quot;, meaning &quot;sheep&quot;, with &quot;cephalus&quot;. This means &quot;head&quot;, reflecting its common name, sheepshead, which it was probably given because of some sheep-like features, such as having large teeth protruding from an open mouth.

==Description==
&quot;Archosargus probatocephalus&quot; has an oval shaped, deep, laterally compressed body with a small blunt head, the dorsal and ventral profiles of the head being convex. It has moderately sized eyes, a small horizontal mouth and the preorbital bone overlaps the rear of the maxilla. The teeth at the front of the jaw are broad and flattened, the upper jaw has three rows of molar-like teeth at the sides. The margin of the preoperculum is smooth, with no serrations or spines. The dorsal fin is long and not high and is supported by 12 spines, the front spine points towards the front and may be embedded, and 11 soft rays. The anal fin contains three spines, the second spine being very robust, and 9 or 10 soft rays. The pectoral fin is long, clearly greater in length than the pelvic fins, extending to the level of the middle spine of the anal fin. The caudal fin is forked. The adults are silvery to greenish-yellow with olive on the upper body. Along the flanks there are five or six dark vertical bars, which fade with age. The caudal and pectoral fins are greenish in colour while the dorsal, anal, and pelvic fins are dark. The sheepshead reaches a maximum published total length of , although is more typical.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Archosargus probatocephalus&quot; is found in the Western Atlantic Ocean where it ranges from Nova Scotia to Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. It mainly occurs in coastal waters in the vicinity of rock pilings, jetties, mangrove roots, and piers, also in tidal creeks. It is euryhaline and shows a preference for brackish waters. It looks for warmer spots around springs and discharges of rivers and will occasionally enter freshwater in the winter.

==Biology==
&quot;Archosargus probatocephalus&quot; is an omnivore, the larger juveniles and adults are predators of blue crab (&quot;Callinectes sapidus&quot;), oysters, clams, crustaceans, and small fish with young Atlantic croakers (&quot;Micropogonias undulatus&quot;) The large flattened teeth are used to crush prey protected by shells or armor as well as to scrape barnacles off rocks and pilings. Juveniles feed on zooplankton, polychaetes, and chironomid larvae.

Populations of this fish in the Atlantic waters off the southern United States spawn mainly in the early spring. However, pelagic larvae have been observed in late winter and spring in the Gulf of Mexico. Adults move further offshore to spawn, going back to coastal waters and estuaries. The juveniles are most numerous in seagrass beds and over mud substrates, and once they grow to a length of around , they leave the seagrass beds and aggregate with the adults.

==Fishing==
&quot;Archosargus probatocephalus&quot; feeds on bivalves and crustaceans, so successful baits include shrimp, sand fleas (mole crabs), clams, fiddler crabs, and mussels. Sheepshead have a habit of stealing bait, so a small hook is necessary. Locating sheepshead with a boat is not difficult: fishermen look for rocky bottoms or places with obstructions, jetties, and the pilings of bridges and piers. The average weight of a sheepshead is , but some individuals reach the range of . This species was subjected to overfishing in the past, and is again becoming more important to commercial fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico as more desirable species, such as red drum (&quot;Sciaenops ocellatus&quot;), decrease through overfishing.

==Parasites==
As with other fish, the sheepshead has a variety of parasites. One of them is the monogenean &quot;Microcotyle archosargi&quot;, which is parasitic on its gills.
==Sheepshead Bay==
&quot;Archosargus probatocephalus&quot; has Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn named after its common name, this fish was found in the waters of the Bay.

<doc id="47586" wikidata="Q1438627" url="?curid=47586" title="Fort Montgomery (Hudson River)">
<text>Fort Montgomery was a fortification built on the west bank of the Hudson River in Highlands, New York by the Continental Army during the American Revolution. Erected in 1776, Fort Montgomery was one of the first major investments by the Americans in strategic construction projects.

Declared a National Historic Landmark, it is part of the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area, owned and operated by the state of New York as the Fort Montgomery State Historic Site.

==Background==
The strategic importance of the ability to control navigation along the Hudson River was obvious to both the Americans and the British from the outbreak of open hostilities. The Hudson was the major means for transportation of supplies and troops throughout a large portion of the northeast. The fort was constructed at a site noted as early as the seventeenth century for its strategic advantage in controlling navigation along the river.

A month after the first open armed conflict in Lexington, the Continental Congress resolved on May 25, 1775 to build fortifications in the Hudson highlands for the purpose of preventing the British from gaining control of the river and dividing the colonies. It noted that &quot;…a post be also taken in the Highlands on each side of Hudson’s River and batteries erected in such a manner as will most effectually prevent any vessels passing that may be sent to harass the inhabitants on the borders of said river…&quot;

==Fort Constitution==
James Clinton and Christopher Tappan, both lifetime residents of the area, were sent to scout appropriate locations. The initial site chosen was further to the north, on Martlaer&#x27;s Island, across from West Point. Plans for the fort called for four bastions. Construction of the fortifications began in the summer of 1775. By November it had 70 cannons. However, difficulties in construction and management of the original plan of fortifications, together with escalating costs, led to abandonment of that project. The site on the north side of Popolopen Creek across from Anthony&#x27;s Nose was proposed, and in January 1776, the materials and resources from Fort Constitution were redirected to the construction at the new site. Construction began on the new Fort Montgomery in March 1776.

==Fort Montgomery==
Fort Montgomery was located at the confluence of Popolopen Creek with the Hudson River near Bear Mountain in Orange County, New York. The fortifications included a river battery of six 32-pound cannons, a cable chain supported by a boom across the Hudson River (see Hudson River Chain), and landward redoubts connected by ramparts, all situated on a cliff promontory rising 100 feet (30 m) above the river. The fort was commanded by General George Clinton, also the newly appointed Patriot governor of the State. Fort Montgomery and its companion fortification, the smaller Fort Clinton, on the southern bank of the Popolopen, held a combined garrison of roughly 700 Colonial soldiers. These men were from the 5th NY Regiment, Lamb&#x27;s Artillery, Orange County Militia, and Ulster County Militia.

The strategic importance of the opposite bank of Popolopen Creek was quickly realized, as it was an elevated cliff terrace with a full view of the Fort Montgomery site and could not be left undefended. These two forts and their associated cannon batteries effectively controlled this stretch of the Hudson River. The Army also conceived a major engineering project to effectively blockade any naval traffic headed north on the river. In 1776 a chain and boom were built across the river to provide a physical barrier to ships, in addition to the combined firepower of the fortifications, which could be massed against ships.

In July 1776, the New York convention appointed a committee, including John Jay, Robert Livingston, George Clinton and Robert Yates, to &quot;devise and carry into execution&quot; measures for &quot;obstructing the channel of Hudson&#x27;s river, or annoying the navigation of the said River.&quot; Worried about lack of arms, the committee worked to buy more cannons.

==Battle of Fort Montgomery==

On October 6, 1777, a combined force of roughly 2,100 Loyalists, Hessians, and British regulars led by Lieutenant General Sir Henry Clinton attacked forts Montgomery and Clinton from the landward side (where the defenses were only partially completed). They had support from cannon fire from British ships on the Hudson River that had passed through the chevaux de frise on the lower river. The land columns attacking from west of the fort consisted of the New York Volunteers, the Loyal American Regiment, Emmerich&#x27;s Chasseurs, the 57th and the 52nd Regiments of Foot. By the end of the day, both forts had fallen to the British, who burned the forts and tore down the stonework buildings.

The battle was strategically barren for the British, however. Their campaign against the forts caused delays in reinforcing General John Burgoyne at Saratoga. Americans gained the upper hand at the Battle of Bemis Heights and forced the surrender of Burgoyne ten days later at the Battle of Saratoga, when the reinforcements were still far to the south.

==Historic Site==

The site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1972. A system of trails and interpretive signs guides visitors through the ruins of the fort.
Designed by the architect Salvatore Cuciti, the Visitor Center opened in October 2006. The timber frame building is oriented to provide visitors with a &quot;gun sight&quot; view down the Hudson. Operated as a state museum, it contains artifacts from the site, mannequins representing military units and a detailed model of the fort.

<text>Neurosis (: neuroses) is a term mainly used today by followers of Freudian thinking to describe mental disorders caused by past anxiety, often that has been repressed. In recent history, the term has been used to refer to anxiety-related conditions more generally.

The term &quot;neurosis&quot; is no longer used in condition names or categories by the World Health Organization&#x27;s &quot;International Classification of Diseases&quot; (ICD) or the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM). According to the &quot;American Heritage Medical Dictionary&quot; of 2007, the term is &quot;no longer used in psychiatric diagnosis&quot;.

Neurosis is distinguished from &quot;psychosis&quot;, which refers to a loss of touch with reality. Its descendant term, &quot;neuroticism&quot;, refers to a personality trait of being prone to anxiousness and mental collapse. The term &quot;neuroticism&quot; is also no longer used for DSM or ICD conditions; however, it is a common name for one of the Big Five personality traits. A similar concept is included in the ICD-11 as the condition &quot;negative affectivity&quot;.

==History==

=== A broad condition (1769–1879) ===

The term &quot;neurosis&quot; was coined by Scottish doctor William Cullen to refer to &quot;disorders of sense and motion&quot; caused by a &quot;general affection of the nervous system&quot;. The term is derived from the Greek word &quot;neuron&quot; (νεῦρον, &#x27;nerve&#x27;) and the suffix &quot;-osis&quot; (-ωσις, &#x27;diseased&#x27; or &#x27;abnormal condition&#x27;). It was first used in print in Cullen&#x27;s &quot;System of Nosology&quot;, first published in Latin in 1769.

Cullen used the term to describe various nervous disorders and symptoms that could not be explained physiologically. Physical features, however, were almost inevitably present, and physical diagnostic tests, such as exaggerated knee-jerks, loss of the gag reflex and dermatographia, were used into the 20th century.

French psychiatrist Phillipe Pinnel&#x27;s &quot;Nosographie philosophique ou La méthode de l&#x27;analyse appliquée à la médecine&quot; (1798) was greatly inspired by Cullen. It divided medical conditions into five categories, with one being &quot;neurosis&quot;. This was divided into four basic types of mental disorder: melancholia, mania, dementia, and idiotism.

Morphine was first isolated from opium in 1805, by German chemist Friedrich Sertürner. After the publication of his third paper on the topic in 1817, morphine became more widely known, and used to treat neuroses and other kinds of mental distress. After becoming addicted to this highly addictive substance, he warned &quot;I consider it my duty to attract attention to the terrible effects of this new substance I called morphium in order that calamity may be averted.&quot;

German psychologist Johann Friedrich Herbart used the term repression in 1824, in a discussion of unconscious ideas competing to get into consciousness.

The tranquilising properties of potassium bromide were noted publicly by British doctor Charles Locock in 1857. Over the coming decades, this and other bromides were used in great quantities to calm people with neuroses. This led to many cases of bromism.

French psychiatrist Henri Legrand du Saulle used exposure therapy to treat phobias.

American doctor Weir Mitchell first published an account of his rest cure for non-psychotic mental disorders in 1875. His 1877 book &quot;Fat and Blood: and how to make them&quot; gave a fuller explanation. The cure originally involved women being isolated in bed, only communicating with a nurse trained to talk about unchallenging topics, a fattening diet of milk, plus massage and the application of electricity. Eventually, the cure advocated by the Mitchell family had less strict isolation and diet, and was followed by men as well as women. &quot;Fat and Blood&quot; was revised and reprinted for many decades.

=== Breuer, Freud and contemporaries (1880-1939) ===

Austrian psychiatrist Josef Breuer first used psychoanalysis to treat hysteria in 1880–1882. Bertha Pappenheim was treated for a variety of symptoms that began when her father suddenly fell seriously ill in mid-1880 during a family holiday in Ischl. His illness was a turning point in her life. While sitting up at night at his sickbed she was suddenly tormented by hallucinations and a state of anxiety. At first the family did not react to these symptoms, but in November 1880, Breuer, a friend of the family, began to treat her. He encouraged her, sometimes under light hypnosis, to narrate stories, which led to partial improvement of the clinical picture, although her overall condition continued to deteriorate.

According to Breuer, the slow and laborious progress of her &quot;remembering work&quot; in which she recalled individual symptoms after they had occurred, thus &quot;dissolving&quot; them, came to a conclusion on 7 June 1882 after she had reconstructed the first night of hallucinations in Ischl. &quot;She has fully recovered since that time&quot; were the words with which Breuer concluded his case report. Accounts differ on the success of Pappenheim&#x27;s treatment by Breuer. She did not speak about this episode in her later life, and vehemently opposed any attempts at psychoanalytic treatment of people in her care. Breuer was not quick to publish about this case.

(Subsequent research has suggested Pappenheim may have had one of a number of neurological illnesses. This includes temporal lobe epilepsy, tuberculous meningitis, and encephalitis. Whatever the nature of her condition, she went on to run an orphanage, and then found and lead the for twenty years.)

The term &quot;psychoneurosis&quot; was coined by Scottish psychiatrist Thomas Clouston for his 1883 book &quot;Clinical Lectures on Mental Diseases&quot;. He describes a condition that covers what is today considered the schizophrenia and autism spectrums (a combination of symptoms that would soon become better known as dementia praecox).
French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot came to believe that psychological trauma was a cause of some cases of hysteria. He wrote in his book &quot;Leçons sur les maladies du système nerveux&quot;, (1885-1887) (and published in English as &quot;Clinical Lectures on the Diseases of the Nervous System):&quot;Quite recently male hysteria has been studied by Messrs. Putnam [1884] and Walton [1883] in America, principally as it occurs after injuries, and especially after railway accidents. They have recognised, like Mr. Page, [1885] who in England has also paid attention to this subject, that many of those nervous accidents described under the name of Railway-spine, and which according to them would be better described as Railway-brain, are in fact, whether occurring in man or woman, simply manifestations of hysteria.Charcot documented around two dozen cases where psychological trauma appears to have caused hysteria. In some cases, the results are described like the modern concept of PTSD.

Austrian psychiatrist Sigmund Freud was a student of Charcot in 1885–6. In 1893 Freud credited Charcot with being the source of &quot;all the modern advances made in the understanding and knowledge of hysteria.&quot;

French psychiatrist Pierre Janet released his book &quot;L&#x27;automatisme psychologique&quot; (Psychological automatism) in 1889, its third chapter detailing his understanding of hypnosis and the unconscious. At this time, he claimed that the main aspect of psychological trauma is dissociation (a disconnection of the conscious mind from reality). (Freud would later claim Janet as a major influence.)

In 1891, Thomas Clouston published &quot;Neuroses of Development&quot;, which covered a wide range of physical and mental developmental conditions.Breuer came to mentor Freud. The pair released the paper &quot;Ueber den psychischen Mechanismus hysterischer Phänomene. (Vorläufige Mittheilung.)&quot; (known in English as &quot;On the physical mechanism of hysterical phenomena: preliminary communication&quot;) in January 1893. It opens with:A chance observation has led us, over a number of years, to investigate a great variety of different forms and symptoms of hysteria, with a view to discovering their precipitating cause the event which provoked the first occurrence, often many years earlier, of the phenomenon in question. In the great majority of cases it is not possible to establish the point of origin by a simple interrogation of the patient, however thoroughly it may be carried out. This is in part because what is in question is often some experience which the patient dislikes discussing; but principally because he is genuinely unable to recollect it and often has no suspicion of the causal connection between the precipitating event and the pathological phenomenon. As a rule it is necessary to hypnotize the patient and to arouse his memories under hypnosis of the time at which the symptom made its first appearance; when this has been done, it becomes possible to demonstrate the connection in the clearest and most convincing fashion...

It is of course obvious that in cases of &#x27;traumatic&#x27; hysteria what provokes the symptoms is the accident. The causal connection is equally evident in hysterical attacks when it is possible to gather from the patient&#x27;s utterances that in each attack he is hallucinating the same event which provoked the first one. The situation is more obscure in the case of other phenomena.

Our experiences have shown us, however, that the most various symptoms, which are ostensibly spontaneous and, as one might say, idiopathic products of hysteria, are just as strictly related to the precipitating trauma as the phenomena to which we have just alluded and which exhibit the connection quite clearly.This paper was reprinted and supplemented with case studies in the pair&#x27;s 1895 book &quot;Studien über Hysterie&quot; (Studies on Hysteria&quot;).&quot; Of the book&#x27;s five case studies, the most famous became that of Breuer&#x27;s patient Bertha Pappenheim (given the pseudonym &quot;Anna O.&quot;). This book established the field of psychoanalysis.

French neurologist Paul Oulmont was mentored by Charcot. In his 1894 book &quot;Thérapeutique des névroses&quot; (Therapy of neuroses), he lists the neuroses as being hysteria, neurasthenia, exophthalmic goitre, epilepsy, migraine, Sydenham&#x27;s chorea, Parkinson&#x27;s disease and tetany.

The fifth edition of German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin&#x27;s popular psychiatry textbook in 1896 gave &quot;neuroses&quot; a well-accepted definition:In the following presentation we want to summarize a group of disease states as general neuroses, which are accompanied by more or less pronounced nervous dysfunctions. What is common to these manifestations of insanity is that we are constantly dealing with the morbid processing of vital stimuli; what they also have in common is the occurrence of more transitory, peculiar manifestations of illness, sometimes in the physical, sometimes in the psychic area. These attacks of fluctuations in mental balance are therefore not independent illnesses, but only the occasional increase in a persistent illness...

It seems useful to me, for the time being, to distinguish between two main forms of general neuroses, epileptic and hysterical insanity.Pierre Janet published the two volume work &quot;Névroses et Idées Fixes&quot; (Neuroses and Fixations) in 1898. According to Janet, neuroses could be usefully divided into hysterias and psychasthenias. Hysterias induced such symptoms as anaesthesia, visual field narrowing, paralyses, and unconscious acts. Psychasthenias involved the ability to adjust to one&#x27;s surroundings, similar to the later concepts of adjustment disorder and executive functions.

Janet founded the French &quot;Société de psychologie&quot; in 1901. This later became the &quot;Société française de psychologie&quot;, and continues today as France&#x27;s main psychology body.

Barbiturates are a class of highly addictive sedative drugs. The first barbiturate, barbital, was synthesized in 1902 by German chemists Emil Fischer and Joseph von Mering and was first marketed as &quot;Veronal&quot; in 1904. The similar barbiturate phenobarbital was brought to market in 1912 under the name &quot;Luminal&quot;. Barbiturates became popular drugs in many countries to reduce neurotic anxiety and displaced the use of bromides.

Janet published the book &quot;Les Obsessions et la Psychasthénie&quot; (The Obsessions and the Psychasthenias) in 1903. Janet followed this with the books &quot;The Major Symptoms of Hysteria&quot; in 1907, and &quot;Les Névroses&quot; (The Neuroses) in 1909.

According to Janet, one cause of neurosis is when the mental force of a traumatic event is stronger than what someone can counter using their normal coping mechanisms.

The Swiss psychiatrist Paul Charles Dubois published the book &quot;Les psychonévroses et leur traitement moral&quot; in 1904, which was translated into English as &quot;Psychic Treatment of Nervous Disorders (The Psychoneuroses and Their Moral Treatment)&quot; in 1905. Dubois believed that neurosis could be successfully treated by listening carefully to patients, and rationally convincing them of the truth — what he called &quot;rational psychotherapy&quot;. This was a form of cognitive behavioural therapy. He also followed Weir Mitchell&#x27;s rest cure, though with a broad fattening diet and other modifications.

Meanwhile, Freud developed a number of different theories of neurosis. The most impactful one was that it referred to mental disorders caused by the brain&#x27;s defence against past psychological trauma. This redefined the general understanding and use of the word. It came to replace the concept of &quot;hysteria&quot;.

He held the First Congress for Freudian Psychology in Salzburg in April 1908. Subsequent Congresses continue today.

Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) was first developed by American psychiatrist and physiologist Edmund Jacobson. This began at Harvard University in 1908. PMR involves learning to relieve the tension in specific muscle groups by first tensing and then relaxing each muscle group. When the muscle tension is released, attention is directed towards the differences felt during tension and relaxation so that the patient learns to recognize the contrast between the states. This reduces anxiety and the effect of phobias.

Freud published the detailed case study &quot;Bemerkungen über einen Fall von Zwangsneurose&quot; (Notes Upon a Case of Obsessional Neurosis) in 1909, documenting his treatment of &quot;Rat Man&quot;.

Freud established the International Psychoanalytical Association (IPA) in March 1910. He arranged for Carl Jung to be its first president. This organisation chose to only provide both psychoanalytic training and recognition to medical doctors.

The American Psychoanalytic Association was founded in 1911 by Welsh neurologist Ernest Jones, with the support of Freud. It followed the IPA&#x27;s practice of only supporting psychoanalysis provided by medical doctors.

Jung gave a speech explaining his understanding of Freud&#x27;s work called &quot;Psychoanalysis and Neurosis&quot; in New York in 1912. It was published in 1916.

The journal &quot;Internationale Zeitschrift für Psychoanalyse&quot; was established in 1913, and continued until 1941.

The battlefield stresses of World War I (1914–18) lead to many cases of strong short-term psychological symptoms, known today as &quot;combat stress reaction&quot; (CSR). Other terms for the condition include &quot;combat fatigue&quot;, &quot;battle fatigue&quot;, &quot;battle neurosis&quot;, &quot;shell shock&quot; and &quot;operational stress reaction&quot;. The general psychological term acute stress disorder was first used for this condition at this time.

The fight-or-flight response was first described by American physiologist Walter Bradford Cannon in 1915.

American military psychiatrist Thomas W. Salmon (the chief consultant in psychiatry in the American Expeditionary Force) released the book &quot;The care and treatment of mental diseases and war neuroses (&quot;shell shock&quot;) in the British army&quot; in 1917, dealing primarily with what was considered was the best treatment for hysteria. His recommendations were broadly adopted in the US armed forces.

Freud&#x27;s most explanatory work on neurosis was his lectures later grouped together as &quot;General Theory of the Neuroses&quot; (1916–17), forming part 3 of the book &quot;Vorlesungen zur Einführung in die Psychoanalyse&quot; (1917), later published in English as &quot;A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis&quot; (1920).

In that work, Freud noted that:The meaning of neurotic symptoms was first discovered by J. Breuer in the study and felicitous cure of a case of hysteria which has since become famous (1880–82). It is true that P. Janet independently reached the same result...

The [neurotic] symptom develops as a substitution for something else that has remained suppressed. Certain psychological experiences should normally have become so far elaborated that consciousness would have attained knowledge of them. This did not take place, however, but out of these interrupted and disturbed processes, imprisoned in the unconscious, the symptom arose...

Our therapy does its work by means of changing the unconscious into the conscious, and is effective only in so far as it has the opportunity of bringing about this transformation...Freud added to this with his paper &quot;Aus der Geschichte einer infantilen Neurose&quot; (From the History of an Infantile Neurosis) published in 1918, which is a detailed case study of his treatment of the &quot;Wolfman&quot;.
The International Journal of Psychoanalysis was founded by Ernest Jones in 1920.

In response to stress injuries from World War I, the British government produced the &quot;Report of the War Office Committee of Inquiry into &quot;Shell-Shock&quot;&quot;, which was published in 1922.

Its recommended course of treatment included: While recognizing that each individual case of war neurosis must be treated on its merits, the Committee are of opinion that good results will be obtained in the majority by the simplest forms of psycho-therapy, i.e., explanation, persuasion and suggestion, aided by such physical methods as baths, electricity and massage. Rest of mind and body is essential in all cases. [The practices of Paul Charles Dubois.]

The committee are of opinion that the production of deep hypnotic sleep, while beneficial as a means of conveying suggestions or eliciting forgotten experiences are useful in selected cases, but in the majority they are unnecessary and may even aggravate the symptoms for a time.

They do not recommend psycho-analysis in the Freudian sense.

In the state of convalescence, re-education and suitable occupation of an interesting nature are of great importance. If the patient is unfit for further military service, it is considered that every endeavor should be made to obtain for him suitable employment on his return to active life.&quot;The common neuroses and their treatment by psychotherapy&quot; was a book released by British psychiatrist Thomas Arthur Ross in 1923, to instruct medical doctors in general. (A second edition was published in 1937, which was subsequently reprinted many times). He also followed the practice of Paul Charles Dubois, and believed &quot;Freudian analysis&quot; was only necessary for the most difficult cases. Ross would later write the books &quot;Introduction to analytical psychotherapy&quot; (1932) and &quot;An enquiry into prognosis in the neuroses&quot; (1936).

In April 1923 Freud published his monograph &quot;Das Ich und das Es&quot; (published in English as &quot;The Ego and the Id),&quot; which included a revised theory of mental functioning, now considering that repression was only one of many defence mechanisms, and that it occurred to reduce anxiety. Hence, Freud characterised repression as both a cause and a result of anxiety.

Austrian literary theorist Otto Rank was a close ally of Freud. His book &quot;The&quot; &quot;Trauma of Birth&quot; (1924) focused more on people&#x27;s choices, rather than Freud&#x27;s focus on drives. He believed in the idea of psychotherapy as opposed to psychoanalysis — that understanding someone&#x27;s neuroses wasn&#x27;t sufficient for effective therapy.

Freud released his book &quot;Hemmung, Symptom und Angst&quot; (Inhibition, Symptom and Anxiety) in 1926, in reaction to Rank&#x27;s book. It detailed his further developed understanding of neurosis and anxiety. (The book was published in English as &quot;The Problem of Anxiety&quot; in 1936.) This book expressed his new view that anxiety created repression, rather than the other way around. 

Freud also published the book &quot;Die Frage der Laienanalyse&quot; (The Question of Lay Analysis) in 1926, in which he endorsed non-doctors performing psychoanalysis. 

In 1929, Austrian psychiatrist Alfred Adler published the book &quot;Problems of Neurosis: A Book of Case-Histories&quot;, furthering the school of individual psychology he had established in 1912.

1929 also saw Edmund Jacobson publishing of the professional instruction book &quot;Progressive Relaxation&quot;. It explained the benefits of relaxation for addressing neuroses and other mental conditions. He followed this with the more publicly-oriented &quot;You Must Relax&quot; in 1934.

Walter Bradford Cannon&#x27;s 1932 book &quot;The Wisdom of the Body&quot; popularised the concept of fight-or-flight.

The American Medical Association released its &quot;Standard Classified Nomenclature of Diseases&quot; in 1933, the first widely accepted such nomenclature in the United States. By the second edition of 1935, its category of &quot;psychoneuroses&quot; included:

* Hysteria
** Anxiety hysteria
** Conversion hysteria
*** Anesthenic type
*** Paralytic type
*** Hyperkinetic type
*** Paresthetic type
*** Autonomic type
*** Amnesic type
** Mixed hysterical psychoneurosis
* Psychasthenia or compulsive states
** Obsession
** Compulsive tics or spasms
** Phobia
** Mixed compulsive states
* Neurasthenia
* Hypochondriasis
* Reactive depression
* Anxiety state
* Mixed psychoneurosis
The general adaptation syndrome (GAS) theory of stress was developed by Austro-Hungarian physiologist Hans Selye in 1936.

In 1937, Austrian-American psychiatrist Adolph Stern proposed that there were many people with conditions that fitted between the definitions of psychoneurosis and psychosis, and called them the &quot;border line group of neuroses&quot;. This group would later become known as borderline personality disorder.

By 1937, the concept of &quot;occupational neuroses&quot; was known by many American health practitioners. It referred to neuroses caused by any aspect of someone&#x27;s employment.

=== 1939–1952 ===
Followers of Freud&#x27;s psychoanalytic thinking, such as Carl Jung, Karen Horney, and Jacques Lacan, continued to discuss the concept of neurosis after Freud&#x27;s death in 1939. The term continues to be used in the Freudian sense in psychology and philosophy.

By 1939, some 120,000 British ex-servicemen had received final awards for primary psychiatric disability or were still drawing pensions – about 15% of all pensioned disabilities – and another 44,000 or so were getting pensions for &quot;soldier&#x27;s heart&quot; or effort syndrome. British historian Ben Shephard notes, &quot;There is, though, much that statistics do not show, because in terms of psychiatric effects, pensioners were just the tip of a huge iceberg.&quot;

Approximately 20% of U.S. troops displayed symptoms of combat stress reaction during WWII (1939-1945). It was assumed to be a temporary response of healthy individuals to witnessing or experiencing traumatic events. Symptoms included depression, anxiety, withdrawal, confusion, paranoia, and sympathetic hyperactivity. Thomas W. Salmon&#x27;s battle neurosis principles were adopted by the U.S. forces during this conflict.

The American Journal of Psychoanalysis was founded by Karen Horney in 1941.

1942 saw American psychologist Carl Rogers publish the handbook &quot;Counseling and Psychotherapy&quot;, which established his school of person-centered therapy.

Austrian psychiatrist Otto Fenichel&#x27;s encyclopaedic textbook &quot;The psychoanalytic theory of neurosis&quot; (1945) set the post-war Freudian orthodoxy on the subject. It has been heavily cited by academic papers in the years since.

Karen Horney&#x27;s &quot;Our Inner Conflicts: A Constructive Theory of Neurosis&quot; (1945) was a popular book on the topic.

The post-World War II boom in the number of patient-treating psychologists in the United States led to a major restructure of the American Psychological Association in 1945. Carl Rogers became its president in 1947.

Austrian psychiatrist Viktor Frankl&#x27;s best selling book &quot;Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning&quot; (1946) launched the psychotherapy school of logotherapy.

For his 1947 book, &quot;Dimensions of Personality&quot;, German-British psychologist Hans Eysenck created the term &quot;neuroticism&quot; to refer to someone whose &quot;constitution may leave them liable to break down [emotionally] with the slightest provocation&quot;. The book outlines a two-factor theory of personality, with neuroticism as one of those two factors. This book would be greatly influential on future personality theory.

Karen Horney&#x27;s &quot;Neurosis and Human Growth&quot; (1950) further expanded the understanding of neuroses.

French-Swiss psychologist Germaine Guex&#x27;s 1950 book &quot;La névrose d&#x27;abandon&quot; proposed the existence of the condition of &quot;abandonment neurosis&quot;. It also detailed all the forms of treatment Geux had found effective in treating it. (It was published in English as &quot;The Abandonment Neurosis&quot; in 2015).

In October 1951, the now highly influential Carl Rogers presented a paper in which he described the relationship between neurosis and his understanding of effective therapy. He wrote:The emotionally maladjusted person, the &quot;neurotic&quot;, is in difficulty first because communication within himself has broken down, and second because as a result of this his communication with others has been damaged. If this sounds somewhat strange, then let me put it in other terms. In the &quot;neurotic&quot; individual, parts of himself which have been termed unconscious, or repressed, or denied to awareness, become blocked off so that they no longer communicate themselves to the conscious or managing part of himself... The task of psychotherapy is to help the person achieve, through a special relationship with the therapist, good communication within himself.The North American Society of Adlerian Psychology was established in 1952, becoming the predominant society of its cause in the world.

=== DSM-I (1952–1968) ===
The first edition of the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM-I) in 1952 included a category named &quot;Psychoneurotic Disorders&quot;.

Regarding the definition of this category, the Manual stated:Grouped as Psychoneurotic Disorders are those disturbances in which &quot;anxiety&quot; is a chief characteristic, directly felt and expressed, or automatically controlled by such defenses as depression, conversion, dissociation, displacement, phobia formation, or repetitive thoughts and acts.

For this nomenclature, a psychoneurotic reaction may be defined as one in which the personality, in its struggle for adjustment to internal and external stresses, utilizes the mechanisms listed above to handle the anxiety created. The qualifying phrase, x.2 with neurotic reaction, may be used to amplify the diagnosis when, in the presence of another psychiatric disturbance, a symptomatic clinical picture appears which might be diagnosed under Psychoneurotic Disorders in this nomenclature. A specific example may be seen in an episode of acute anxiety occurring in a homosexual.Conditions in the category included:

* Anxiety reaction
* Dissociative reaction
* Conversion reaction
* Phobic reaction
* Obsessive compulsive reaction
* Depressive reaction
* Psychoneurotic reaction, other

The DSM-I also included a category of &quot;transient situational personality disorders&quot;. This included the diagnosis of &quot;gross stress reaction&quot;. This was defined as a normal personality using established patterns of reaction to deal with overwhelming fear as a response to conditions of great stress. The diagnosis included language which relates the condition to combat as well as to &quot;civilian catastrophe&quot;. The other situational disorders were &quot;adult situational reaction&quot; and a variety of time-of-life delineated &quot;adjustment reactions&quot;. These referred to short-term reactions to stressors.

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) were developed for the treatment of neurosis and other conditions from the early 1950s. Because of their undesirable adverse-effect profile and high potential for toxicity, their use was limited.

The use of modern exposure therapy for neuroses began in the 1950s in South Africa. South African-American Joseph Wolpe was one of the first psychiatrists to spark interest in treating psychiatric problems as behavioral issues.

In May 1950, pharmacologist Frank Berger (Czech-American) and chemist Bernard John Ludwig engineered meprobamate to be a non-drowsy tranquiliser. Launched as &quot;Miltown&quot; in 1955, it rapidly became the first blockbuster psychotropic drug in American history, becoming popular in Hollywood and gaining fame for its effects. It is highly addictive.

&quot;The Meaning of Anxiety&quot; was a book released by American psychiatrist Rollo May in 1950. It reviewed the existing research on the subject. It found that some anxiety was a simple reaction to related stimuli, while other anxiety had a more complicated and neurotic beginning. A revised edition of the book was published in 1977.

After the Korean War (1950-1953), Thomas W. Salmon&#x27;s battle neurosis treatment practices became summarised as the PIE principles:

* Proximity – treat the casualties close to the front and within sound of the fighting.
* Immediacy – treat them without delay and not wait until the wounded were all dealt with.
* Expectancy – ensure that everyone had the expectation of their return to the front after a rest and replenishment.

The Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale was created by American psychologist Janet Taylor in 1953. It measures anxiousness as a personality trait.

The International Association of Analytical Psychology was founded in 1955. It is the predominant organisation devoted to the psychology of Carl Jung.

The American Academy of Psychoanalysis was founded in 1956, for psychiatrists to discuss psychoanalysis in ways that deviated from the orthodoxy of the time.

Also in 1956, American psychologist Albert Ellis publicly read his first paper on his methodology &quot;rational psychotherapy&quot;&quot;.&quot; (He took inspiration from, and used the same name as the methodology of Paul Charles Dubois. He claimed additional inspiration from Freud and Epicetus). This and later works defined what is now known as rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT). Ellis believed that people&#x27;s erroneous beliefs about their adversities was a major cause of neurosis, and his therapy aimed to dissolve these neuroses by correcting people&#x27;s understandings. Ellis published the first REBT book, &quot;How to live with a neurotic,&quot; in 1957. 

Albert Ellis and others founded &quot;The Institute for Rational Living&quot; in April 1959, which later became the Albert Ellis Institute.

The concept of &quot;institutional neurosis&quot; was coined by British psychiatrist Russell Barton, and explained in his well-cited 1959 book &quot;Institutional Neurosis&quot;. Barton believed that many of the mental health symptoms had by people living in mental hospitals and similar institutions were caused by being in those environments, rather than other causes. Barton was a leader in the deinstitutionalisation movement. (This form of neurosis later came to be known as &quot;institutional syndrome&quot;).

Benzodiazepines are a class of highly addictive sedative drugs that reduce anxiety by depressing function in certain parts of the brain. The first of these drugs, chlordiazepoxide (Librium), was made available for sale in 1960. (It was discovered by Polish-American chemist Leo Sternbach in 1955.) Librium was followed with the more popular diazepam (Valium) in 1963. These drugs soon displaced Miltown.

Spanish history writer Jose M. Lopez Pinero published &quot;Origenes historicos del concepto de neurosis&quot; in 1963. It was published in English as &quot;Historical Origins of the Concept of Neurosis&quot; in 1983.

Neurotics Anonymous began in February 1964, as a twelve-step program to help the neurotic. It was founded in Washington, D.C. by American psychologist Grover Boydston, and has since spread through the Americas.

Also in 1964, Polish psychiatrist Kazimierz Dąbrowski released his book &quot;Positive Disintegration&quot;. The book argues that developing and resolving psychoneurosis is a necessary part of healthy personality development.

The year 1964 also saw the establishment of the American Psychological Association&#x27;s Division 25, a group of psychologists interested in behaviourism.

The popular textbook &quot;The causes and cures of neurosis; an introduction to modern behaviour therapy based on learning theory and the principles of conditioning&quot; was published in 1965 by Hans Eysenck and South African-British psychologist Stanley Rachman. It aimed to replace the Freudian approach to neurosis with behaviorism.
The &quot;Hopkins Symptom Checklist&quot; (HSCL) is a self-report symptom inventory that was developed in the mid-1960s from earlier checklists. It measures somatization, obsession-compulsion, interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety and depression.

In 1966, psychologists began to observe large numbers of children of Holocaust survivors seeking mental help in clinics in Canada. The grandchildren of Holocaust survivors were overrepresented by 300% among the referrals to psychiatry clinics in comparison with their representation in the general population. Further study lead to the better understanding of transgenerational trauma.

The noted book &quot;Psychological stress and the coping process&quot; was released by American psychologist Richard Lazarus in 1966.

The well-cited book &quot;Anxiety and Behaviour&quot; was also released in 1966. As with Eysenck and Rachman&#x27;s book, it aimed to connect neuroses with behaviourism. It was edited by American psychologist Charles Spielberger.

The Association for Advancement of Behavioral Therapies was founded in 1966. (In 2005, it became the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies.)

=== DSM-II (1968–1980) ===

After Freudian thinking became less prominent in psychology, the term &quot;neurosis&quot; came to be used as a near synonym for &quot;anxiety&quot;. The second edition of the DSM (&quot;DSM-II&quot;) in 1968 described neuroses thusly: Anxiety is the chief characteristic of the neuroses. It may be felt and expressed directly, or it may be controlled unconsciously and automatically by conversion [into physical symptoms], displacement [into mental symptoms] and various other psychological mechanisms. Generally, these mechanisms produce symptoms experienced as subjective distress from which the patient desires relief. The neuroses, as contrasted to the psychoses, manifest neither gross distortion or misinterpretation of external reality, nor gross personality disorganization...Included in this category were the conditions:

* Hysterical neurosis
** Hysterical neurosis, conversion type
** Hysterical neurosis, dissociative type
* Phobic neurosis
* Obsessive compulsive neurosis
* Depressive neurosis
* Neurasthenic neurosis (neurasthenia)
* Depersonalization neurosis (depersonalization syndrome)
* Hypochondriacal neurosis
* Other neurosis
* Unspecified neurosis

What was previously &quot;gross stress reaction&quot; and &quot;adult situational reaction&quot; was combined into the new &quot;adjustment disorder of adult life&quot;, a condition covering mild to strong reactions. Other adjustment disorders for other times-of-life were also included. (Also, the category &quot;transient situational personality disorders&quot; was renamed &quot;transient situational disturbances.&quot;)

&quot;Anxiety and Neurosis&quot; was a popular mass-market book released in 1968 by British psychologist Charles Rycroft.

&quot;Neuroses and Personality Disorders&quot; was a popular textbook released by American psychologist Elton B McNeil in 1970.

The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was developed by Charles Spielberger and others, and first published in 1970. It provides separate &quot;state&quot; and &quot;trait&quot; measures of a person&#x27;s anxiety. A revised form was released in 1983.

The book &quot;Primal Scream. Primal Therapy: The Cure for Neurosis&quot; by American psychologist Arthur Janov was released in 1970. It established primal therapy as a treatment for neurosis. It is based on the idea that neurosis is caused by the repressed pain of childhood trauma. Janov argued that repressed pain can be sequentially brought to conscious awareness for resolution through re-experiencing specific incidents and fully expressing the resulting pain during therapy. Janov criticizes the talking therapies as they deal primarily with the cerebral cortex and higher-reasoning areas and do not access the source of Pain within the more basic parts of the central nervous system. (A second edition of the book was published in 1999).

Chinese-American psychiatrist William WK Zung released his &quot;Anxiety Status Inventory&quot; (ASI) and patient &quot;Self-rating Anxiety Scale&quot; (SAS) in November 1971.

Dąbrowski expanded on his earlier book with &quot;Psychoneurosis Is Not An Illness: Neuroses And Psychoneuroses From The Perspective Of Positive Disintegration&quot; in 1972.

&quot;Anxiety: Current Trends in Theory and Research&quot; is a well-cited series of two books released in 1972, and were edited by Charles Spielberger.

American anthropologist Ernst Becker in his Pulitzer-winning book The Denial of Death (1973) argued that the repression of the fear of death had a number of advantages, and that this was a major source of neurosis.

The first tetracyclic anti-depressant (TeCA) maprotiline (Ludiomil) was developed by Ciba, and patented in 1966. It was introduced for medical use in 1974. TeCAs mianserin (Tolvon) and amoxapine (Asendin) followed shortly thereafter and mirtazapine (Remeron) being introduced later on. Albert Ellis&#x27; work was expanded on by fellow American, psychiatrist Aaron Beck. In 1975, Beck released the greatly influential book &quot;Cognitive Therapy and the Emotional Disorders&quot;. Beck&#x27;s cognitive therapy became popular, soon becoming the most popular form of CBT and often being known by that name.

American psychiatrist and historian Kenneth Levin&#x27;s &quot;Freud&#x27;s early psychology of the neuroses: a historical perspective&quot; was published in 1978.

American-Israeli medical sociologist Aaron Antonovsky in his 1979 book &quot;Stress, Health and Coping&quot;, stated that an event will not be perceived as stressful when it is appraised as consistent, under some personal control of the outcome, and balanced between underload and overload. Someone resistant to stress will see potential stressors as instead being &quot;meaningful, predictable, and ordered.&quot; Antonovsky proposed that stress and a lack of an individual&#x27;s &quot;resistance resources&quot; (to stressors) may be the main underlying causes of illness and disease, not just mental neuroses. This book established the field of salutogenesis.

In January 1980, Stanley Rachman published a well-cited working definition of &quot;emotional processing&quot;, aiming to define the &quot;certain psychological experiences&quot; Freud had mentioned in his 1923 book (and had earlier referred to). It included lists of things likely to improve or retard such processing.

=== DSM-III (1980–1994) ===
The DSM replaced its &quot;neurosis&quot; category with an &quot;anxiety disorders&quot; category in 1980, with the release of the &quot;DSM-III&quot;. It did this because of a decision by its editors to provide descriptions of behavior rather than descriptions of hidden psychological mechanisms. This change was controversial.

This edition of the book also included a condition named &quot;post-traumatic stress disorder&quot; for the first time. This was similar in definition to the &quot;gross stress reaction&quot; of the DSM-I.

The anxiety disorders were defined as:

* Phobic disorders (or phobic neuroses)
** Agoraphobia with panic attacks
** Agoraphobia without panic attacks
** Social phobia
** Simple phobia
* Anxiety states (or anxiety neuroses)
** Panic disorder
** Generalised anxiety disorder
** Obsessive compulsive disorder (or obsessive compulsive neuroses)
** Post-traumatic stress disorder, acute
** Post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic or delayed
* Atypical anxiety disorder

Adjustment disorder remained, and was defined separately. Its time-of-life based subtypes were abolished, replaced with combinations with co-morbid syndromes (such as &quot;Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood&quot; and &quot;Adjustment Disorder with Anxious Mood&quot;). Adjustment disorder returned to being a short-term condition.

Somatoform disorders, disassociation, depression and hypochondria (all previously considered neuroses) were also treated separately. Neurasthenia (a neurosis that caused otherwise unexplainable fatigue) was loosely mapped to a mild form of depression.

The American &quot;National Membership Committee on Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social Work&quot; was established in May 1980. (It became the &quot;American Association for Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social Work&quot; in 2007).

American psychiatrist George F. Drinka released the history book &quot;Birth of Neurosis: Myth, Malady, and the Victorians&quot; in 1984.

The World Association of Psychoanalysis was founded in January 1992, and became the largest organisation devoted to the psychotherapy of Jacques Lacan.

=== DSM-5 (2013–current) ===
In 2013, the DSM-5 was released, separating out the &quot;trauma and stress-related disorders&quot; (Freud&#x27;s etiology for neuroses) from the &quot;anxiety disorders&quot;. The former category includes:

* Reactive attachment disorder
* Disinhibited social engagement disorder
* Posttraumatic stress disorder
* Acute stress disorder
* Adjustment disorders
* Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder
** Adjustment-like disorders with a late onset
** Ataque de nervios
** Dhat syndrome
** Khyâl cap
** Kufungisisa
** Maladi moun
** Nervios
** Shenjing shuairuo
** Susto
** Taijin kyofusho
** Persistent complex bereavement disorder
* Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder

== Prevention ==

Stress inoculation training was developed to reduce anxiety in doctors during times of intense stress by Donald Meichenbaum. It is a combination of techniques including relaxation, negative thought suppression, and real-life exposure to feared situations used in PTSD treatment. The therapy is divided into four phases and is based on the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy. The first phase identifies the individual&#x27;s specific reaction to stressors and how they manifest into symptoms. The second phase helps teach techniques to regulate these symptoms using relaxation methods. The third phase deals with specific coping strategies and positive cognitions to work through the stressors. Finally, the fourth phase exposes the client to imagined and real-life situations related to the traumatic event. This training helps to shape the response to future triggers to diminish impairment in daily life.

Patients with acute stress disorder (ASD) have been found to benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy in preventing PTSD, with clinically meaningful outcomes at six-month follow-up consultations. Supportive counseling was outperformed by a regimen of relaxation, cognitive restructuring, imaginal exposure, and in-vivo exposure. Programs based on mindfulness-based stress reduction also seem to be useful at managing stress.

Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) was developed by Edmund Jacobson. PMR involves learning to relieve the tension in specific muscle groups by first tensing and then relaxing each muscle group. When the muscle tension is released, attention is directed towards the differences felt during tension and relaxation so that the patient learns to recognize the contrast between the states. This reduces anxiety.

Playing Tetris shortly after a traumatic experience prevents the development of PTSD in some cases.

Stanley Rachman compiled lists of factors that promote or impede &quot;emotional processing&quot; in 1980, the former reducing the development of neurosis, the latter making it more likely.

Aaron Antonovsky stated that a resilient person is more likely to appraise a situation as &quot;meaningful, predictable, and ordered.&quot;

Michael Rutter found that resilience could be improved in an individual by the 1) reduction of risk impact, 2) reduction of negative chain reactions, 3) establishment and maintenance of self-esteem and self-efficacy, and 4) opening up of opportunities.

The use of pharmaceuticals to mitigate the consequences of ASD has made some progress. The Alpha-1 blocker Prazosin, which controls sympathetic response, can be administered to patients to help them unwind and enable better sleep. It is unclear how it functions in this situation. Following a traumatic experience, hydrocortisone (cortisol) has demonstrated some promise as an early prophylactic intervention, frequently slowing the onset of PTSD.

In a systematic literature review in 2014, the Swedish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services (SBU) found that a number of work environment factors could affect the risk of developing exhaustion disorder or depressive symptoms:

* People who experience a work situation with little opportunity to influence, in combination with too high demands, develop more depressive symptoms.
* People who experience a lack of compassionate support in the work environment develop more symptoms of depression and exhaustion disorder than others. Those who experience bullying or conflict in their work develop more depressive symptoms than others, but it is not possible to determine whether there is a corresponding connection for symptoms of exhaustion disorder.
* People who feel that they have urgent work or a work situation where the reward is perceived as small in relation to the effort develops more symptoms of depression and exhaustion disorder than others. This also applies to those who experience insecurity in the employment, for example concerns that the workplace will be closed down.
* In some work environments, people have less trouble. People who experience good opportunities for control in their own work and those who feel that they are treated fairly develop less symptoms of depression and exhaustion disorder than others.
* Women and men with similar working conditions develop symptoms of depression as much as exhaustion disorder.

==Etiology==

=== Historic versions of the DSM and ICD ===
The term &quot;neurosis&quot; is no longer used in a professional diagnostic sense, it having been eliminated from the DSM in 1980 with the publication of DSM III, and having the last remnants of being removed from the ICD with the enacting of the ICD-11 in 2022. (In the ICD-10 it was used in section F48.8 to describe certain minor conditions.)

According to the &quot;anxiety&quot; concept of the term, there were many different neuroses, including:

* obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD)
* obsessive–compulsive personality disorder
* impulse control disorder
* anxiety disorder
* histrionic personality disorder
*dissociative disorder
* a great variety of phobias

According to C. George Boeree, professor emeritus at Shippensburg University, the symptoms of neurosis may involve:

===Psychoanalytic (Freudian) theory===
According to psychoanalytic theory, neuroses may be rooted in ego defense mechanisms, though the two concepts are not synonymous. Defense mechanisms are a normal way of developing and maintaining a consistent sense of self (i.e., an &quot;ego&quot;). However, only those thoughts and behaviors that produce difficulties in one&#x27;s life should be called &quot;neuroses&quot;.

A neurotic person experiences emotional distress and unconscious conflict, which are manifested in various physical or mental illnesses; the definitive symptom being anxiety. Neurotic tendencies are common and may manifest themselves as acute or chronic anxiety, depression, OCD, a phobia, or a personality disorder.

Freud&#x27;s typology of neuroses in &quot;Introduction to Psychoanalysis&quot; (1923) included:

* Psychoneuroses
** Transference neuroses
*** Hysteria
**** Anxiety hysteria
***** Various phobias
**** Conversion hysteria
*** Compulsion neuroses
** Trauma neuroses
** Narcissistic neuroses
* True neuroses
** Neurasthenia
** Anxiety neurosis
** Hypochondria
** Paraphrenia [schizophrenia spectrum]
*** Dementia praecox
*** Paranoia
**** Megalomania
**** Mania of persecution
**** Erotomania
**** Mania of jealousy

===Jungian theory===
Carl Jung found his approach particularly effective for patients who are well adjusted by social standards but are troubled by existential questions. Jung claims to have &quot;frequently seen people become neurotic when they content themselves with inadequate or wrong answers to the questions of life&quot;. Accordingly, the majority of his patients &quot;consisted not of believers but of those who had lost their faith&quot;. A contemporary person, according to Jung, ... is blind to the fact that, with all his rationality and efficiency, he is possessed by &#x27;powers&#x27; that are beyond his control. His gods and demons have not disappeared at all; they have merely got new names. They keep him on the run with restlessness, vague apprehensions, psychological complications, an insatiable need for pills, alcohol, tobacco, food — and, above all, a large array of neuroses.Jung found that the unconscious finds expression primarily through an individual&#x27;s inferior psychological function, whether it is thinking, feeling, sensation, or intuition. The characteristic effects of a neurosis on the dominant and inferior functions are discussed in his &quot;Psychological Types&quot;. Jung also found collective neuroses in politics: &quot;Our world is, so to speak, dissociated like a neurotic.&quot;

===Horney&#x27;s theory===
In her final book, &quot;Neurosis and Human Growth&quot;, Karen Horney lays out a complete theory of the origin and dynamics of neurosis. In her theory, neurosis is a distorted way of looking at the world and at oneself, which is determined by compulsive needs rather than by a genuine interest in the world as it is. Horney proposes that neurosis is transmitted to a child from their early environment and that there are many ways in which this can occur:

The child&#x27;s initial reality is then distorted by their parents&#x27; needs and pretenses. Growing up with neurotic caretakers, the child quickly becomes insecure and develops basic anxiety. To deal with this anxiety, the child&#x27;s imagination creates an idealized self-image:

Once they identify themselves with their idealized image, a number of effects follow. They will make claims on others and on life based on the prestige they feel entitled to because of their idealized self-image. They will impose a rigorous set of standards upon themselves in order to try to measure up to that image. They will cultivate pride, and with that will come the vulnerabilities associated with pride that lacks any foundation. Finally, they will despise themselves for all their limitations. Vicious circles will operate to strengthen all of these effects.

Eventually, as they grow to adulthood, a particular &quot;solution&quot; to all the inner conflicts and vulnerabilities will solidify. They will be either:

* expansive, displaying symptoms of narcissism, perfectionism, or vindictiveness.
* self-effacing and compulsively compliant, displaying symptoms of neediness or codependence.
* resigned, displaying schizoid tendencies.

In Horney&#x27;s view, mild anxiety disorders and full-blown personality disorders all fall under her basic scheme of neurosis as variations in the degree of severity and in the individual dynamics. The opposite of neurosis is a condition Horney calls &quot;self-realization&quot;, a state of being in which the person responds to the world with the full depth of their spontaneous feelings, rather than with anxiety-driven compulsion. Thus, the person grows to actualize their inborn potentialities. Horney compares this process to an acorn that grows and becomes a tree: the acorn has had the potential for a tree inside it all along.

<text>In electronics, acoustics, and related fields, the waveform of a signal is the shape of its graph as a function of time, independent of its time and magnitude scales and of any displacement in time. &quot;Periodic waveforms&quot; repeat regularly at a constant period. The term can also be used for non-periodic or aperiodic signals, like chirps and pulses.

In electronics, the term is usually applied to time-varying voltages, currents, or electromagnetic fields. In acoustics, it is usually applied to steady periodic sounds — variations of pressure in air or other media. In these cases, the waveform is an attribute that is independent of the frequency, amplitude, or phase shift of the signal.

The waveform of an electrical signal can be visualized in an oscilloscope or any other device that can capture and plot its value at various times, with suitable scales in the time and value axes. The electrocardiograph is a medical device to record the waveform of the electric signals that are associated with the beating of the heart; that waveform has important diagnostic value. Waveform generators, that can output a periodic voltage or current with one of several waveforms, are a common tool in electronics laboratories and workshops.

The waveform of a steady periodic sound affects its timbre. Synthesizers and modern keyboards can generate sounds with many complicated waveforms.

== Common periodic waveforms ==

Simple examples of periodic waveforms include the following, where formula_1 is time, formula_2 is wavelength, formula_3 is amplitude and formula_4 is phase:

*Sine wave: formula_5 The amplitude of the waveform follows a trigonometric sine function with respect to time.
*Square wave: formula_6 This waveform is commonly used to represent digital information. A square wave of constant period contains odd harmonics that decrease at −6 dB/octave.
*Triangle wave: formula_7 It contains odd harmonics that decrease at −12 dB/octave.
*Sawtooth wave: formula_8 This looks like the teeth of a saw. Found often in time bases for display scanning. It is used as the starting point for subtractive synthesis, as a sawtooth wave of constant period contains odd and even harmonics that decrease at −6 dB/octave.

The Fourier series describes the decomposition of periodic waveforms, such that any periodic waveform can be formed by the sum of a (possibly infinite) set of fundamental and harmonic components. Finite-energy non-periodic waveforms can be analyzed into sinusoids by the Fourier transform.

Other periodic waveforms are often called composite waveforms and can often be described as a combination of a number of sinusoidal waves or other basis functions added together.

<doc id="47595" wikidata="Q81126" url="?curid=47595" title="Manchuria">
<text>Manchuria is a historical region in northeast Asia encompassing the entirety of present-day northeast China and parts of the modern-day Russian Far East. The exact geographical extent varies depending on the definition: in the narrow sense, the area constituted by three Chinese provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning as well as the eastern Inner Mongolian prefectures of Hulunbuir, Hinggan, Tongliao, and Chifeng; in a broader sense, historical Manchuria includes those regions plus the Amur river basin, parts of which were ceded to the Russian Empire by the Manchu-led Qing dynasty during the Amur Annexation of 1858–1860. The parts of Manchuria ceded to Russia are collectively known as Outer Manchuria or Russian Manchuria, which include present-day Amur Oblast, Primorsky Krai, the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, the southern part of Khabarovsk Krai, and the eastern edge of Zabaykalsky Krai.

The name &quot;Manchuria&quot; is an exonym (derived from the endonym &quot;Manchu&quot;) of Japanese origin. The history of &quot;Manchuria&quot; (&quot;Manzhou&quot;) as a toponym in China is disputed, with some scholars believing it was never used while others believe it was by the late 19th century. The area was historically referred to by various names in the Qing dynasty such as &quot;Guandong&quot; (East of the Pass) or the &quot;Three Provinces&quot; referring to Fengtian, Heilongjiang, and Jilin. &quot;Manchuria&quot; as a geographical term was first used in the 18th or 19th centuries by the Japanese before spreading to Europe. The term was promoted by the Japanese Empire in support for the existence of its puppet state, Manchukuo. Although the toponym is still used, some scholars treat the term with caution or avoid it altogether due to its association with Japanese colonialism. The term is deprecated in China due to its association with Japanese imperialism and ethnic connotations. As a result, areas once considered part of Manchuria are simply referred to as the &quot;Northeast&quot;. The &quot;Three Provinces&quot; and the &quot;Northeast&quot; were also in concurrent use among the Japanese along with &quot;Manchuria&quot; until the Mukden incident of 1931.

The area is home to many ethnic groups, including the Manchus, Mongols, Koreans, Nanai, Nivkhs, and Ulchs. Many of the early ancient Koreanic kingdoms were established in the area. It is the ancestral homeland to the Tungusic-speaking Jurchens and their descendants, the Manchus.

== Boundaries ==

Manchuria is now most often associated with the three Chinese provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning. The former Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo further included the prefectures of Chengde (now in Hebei), and Hulunbuir, Hinggan, Tongliao, and Chifeng (now in Inner Mongolia). The region of the Qing dynasty referenced as Manchuria originally further included Primorskiy Kray, the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, the southern parts of Amur Oblast and Khabarovskiy Kray, and a corner of Zabaykalʼskiy Kray. These districts were acknowledged as Qing territory by the 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk but ceded to the Russian Empire due to the Amur Annexation in the unequal 1858 Treaty of Aigun and 1860 Convention of Beijing (the People&#x27;s Republic of China indirectly questioned the legitimacy of these treaties in the 1960s, but has more recently signed agreements such as the 2001 Sino-Russian Treaty of Friendship, which affirm the current status quo; a minor exchange nonetheless occurred in 2004 at the confluence of the Amur and Ussuri rivers). Various senses of Greater Manchuria sometimes further include Sakhalin Island, which despite its lack of mention in treaties was shown as Qing territory on period Chinese, Japanese, Russian, and French maps of the area.

The drainage basin of the Amur River apart to the east towards Mongolia roughly corresponds to the geographical area of the historic land of the Manchu people. The northern boundary was marked by mountains.

===Manchuria===
====Origins====
The geographical term &quot;Manchuria&quot; was first used in the 18th or 19th century by the Japanese. &quot;Manchuria&quot; – variations of which arrived in European languages through Dutch – is a calque of Latin of the Japanese placename &quot;Manshū&quot; &quot;Region of the Manchus&quot;), which dates from the 18th century.

According to the American researcher Mark C. Elliott, the term &quot;Manshū&quot; first appeared as a placename in Katsuragawa Hoshū&#x27;s 1794 work &quot;Hokusa Bunryaku&quot; in two maps, &quot;Ashia zenzu&quot; and &quot;Chikyū hankyū sōzu&quot;, which were also created by Katsuragawa. According to Junko Miyawaki-Okada, Japanese geographer Takahashi Kageyasu was the first to use the term &quot;Manshū&quot; as a toponym in 1809 in the &quot;Nippon Henkai Ryakuzu&quot;, and it was from that work that Westerners adopted the name. By the 1830s, various Indo-European forms of &quot;Manshū&quot; could be found. However, according to Li Narangoa, the term was introduced to Japan in the 18th century through European maps following Jesuit conventions.

&quot;Manshū&quot; then increasingly appeared on maps by Japanese cartographers such as Kondi Jūzō, Takahashi Kageyasu, Baba Sadayoshi, and Yamada Ren. Their maps were brought to Europe by Philipp Franz von Siebold. According to Japanese scholar Nakami Tatsuo, Siebold was the one who brought the usage of the term &quot;Manchuria&quot; to Europeans after borrowing it from the Japanese, who were the first to use it in a geographic manner in the 18th century.

====China====
The history of the use of &quot;Manchuria&quot; as a toponym in China is uncertain. According to one stream of thought, it was not used by the Manchus or the Chinese. The name &quot;Manchu&quot; was given to the Jurchen people by Hong Taiji in 1635 as a new name for their ethnic group. However neither the name &quot;Manchu&quot; or the Chinese rendering of &quot;Manshū&quot; as &quot;Manzhou&quot; ever acquired geographical connotations, while in Japanese, both &quot;Manchuria&quot; and &quot;Manchu&quot; are rendered as &quot;Manshū&quot;. According to Nakami Tatsuo, &quot;Manzhou&quot; was used to refer to Manchu people or one of their states rather than a region: &quot;Originally, &quot;Manzhou&quot; was the name of the Manchu people or of their state; it was not the name of a region. In fact, neither Manchus nor Han Chinese have ever called China&#x27;s Northeast &#x27;Manzhou&#x27;.&quot; Even advocates of an independent Manchuria such as Inaba Iwakichi acknowledged this. In 1912, British diplomat and sinologist Herbert Giles stated in &quot;China and the Manchus&quot; that &quot;&#x27;Manchuria&#x27; is unknown to the Chinese or to the Manchus themselves as a geographical expression&quot;. According to Owen Latimore, during his travels in China during the late 1920s, he found &quot;no single Chinese name for Manchuria as a unit&quot;. Historical geographer Philippe Forêt concurred, noting that there is no word for &quot;Manchuria&quot; in either Chinese or Manchu languages.

Another perspective delineated by scholars such as Mark C. Elliott and Li Narangoa argues that Manchu consciousness of their homeland as a unique place contributed to the creation of Manchuria as a distinct geographical entity, and that &quot;Manchuria&quot; (&quot;Manzhou&quot;) was used as a toponym by the Chinese. According to Elliott, the Manchu imperial lineage believed that their original homeland was the Changbai Mountains. The Qing court endeavored to create a regional identity focused on the Changbai Mountains, which gradually became a symbol of Manchu identity. However, it is uncertain whether that notion was shared among ordinary Manchus, and there is evidence that part of that effort was to combat widespread acculturation among Manchus, resulting in the loss of their language. As part of this effort, Jesuits were commissioned to create maps that enhanced Manchu conceptualization of their homeland, which Elliot believes to have been the original impetus to label the region as Manchuria in European and Japanese maps. In 1877, &quot;Manzhou&quot; was used as a toponym in an essay by Gong Chai, a scholar from Ningbo. The description of &quot;Manzhou&quot; located it to the northeast of Beijing and identified it as the birthplace of the dynasty. &quot;Manzhou&quot; was used as a place name again 20 years later by Qing officials. &quot;Manzhou&quot; began to appear on Chinese maps in the first decade of the 1900s. Maps that used &quot;Manzhou&quot; were in the minority during the early Republican period but the name remained in common use among the Chinese Communist Party into the 1930s. Names for the region were relatively fluid before the Mukden Incident of 1931, after which alternative names in Japanese were discarded for &quot;Manshū&quot;, and &quot;Dongbei&quot; (Northeast) and &quot;Dongsansheng&quot; (Three Eastern Provinces) became the orthodox names for the Chinese. According to Mark Gamsa, &quot;Manzhou&quot; was not widely used among the Chinese but the People&#x27;s Republic of China disapproved of it regardless. By the 1950s, &quot;Manzhou&quot; had virtually disappeared as a toponym although some still used it out of habit.

====Japan====
The term &quot;Manchuria&quot; has been described as &quot;controversial&quot; or &quot;troublesome&quot; by several scholars including Mark C. Elliott, Norman Smith, and Mariko Asano Tamanoi. The historian Norman Smith wrote that &quot;The term &#x27;Manchuria&#x27; is controversial&quot; based on reasons outlined by Mariko Asano Tamanoi in the &quot;Introduction&quot; of &quot;Crossed Histories: Manchuria in the Age of Empire&quot; (2005). According to Tamanoi, &quot;&#x27;Manchuria&#x27; is a product of Japanese imperialism, and to call the area Manzhou is to accept uncritically a Japanese colonial legacy.&quot; Japan used the name &quot;Manchuria&quot; to convey the idea of a contested region distinct from China while China insisted on its ownership of the region by rejecting the name &quot;Manchuria&quot;. Japanese colonists who returned to Japan from Manchukuo in the post-war period used terms such as &quot;Manshu&quot; (Manchuria), &quot;Man-mō&quot; (Manchuria-Mongolia), and &quot;Mō-man&quot; (Mongolia-Manchuria) almost interchangeably. Hyphenated terms such as &quot;Man-sēn&quot; (Manchuria and Korea) and &quot;Man-mō&quot; (Manchuria-Mongolia) emerged in Japanese media and traveler writings during the first three decades of the 20th century, implying that these regions were extensions of each other. Tamanoi notes that the name &quot;Manchuria&quot; cannot be found on Chinese maps and acknowledged that she &quot;should use the term in quotation marks&quot; even though she did not.

Historian Bill Sewell denies that &quot;Manchuria&quot; is &quot;a genuine geographic term&quot;, claiming the Japanese never viewed Manchuria as a discrete entity and it was Europeans who first started using the name Manchuria to refer to the location. Others such as Forêt described &quot;Manchuria&quot; as a solely geographical term without indicating a political connection and used it in that capacity despite acknowledging its imperialistic overtones. The historian Gavan McCormack agreed with Robert H. G. Lee&#x27;s statement that &quot;The term Manchuria or Man-chou is a modern creation used mainly by westerners and Japanese&quot;, with McCormack writing that the term Manchuria is imperialistic in nature and has no &quot;precise meaning&quot; since the Japanese deliberately promoted the use of &quot;Manchuria&quot; as a geographic name to promote its separation from China at the time they were setting up their puppet state of Manchukuo. In the 1920s, Japanese media still presented Manchuria as part of China, albeit as a distinct region, and sometimes called it the &quot;Garden of China&quot;. However, in 1932, the puppet state of Manchukuo was founded covering not only the northeastern three provinces but also parts of eastern Inner Mongolia. In 1933, the Bureau of Information and the Publicity Department of Foreign Affairs of the Manchukuo Government published a &quot;Handbook of Information of Manchukuo&quot; stating that Manchuria did not belong to China, had its own history and traditions, and was the home of the Manchus and Mongols. Elliot notes that one scholar considered the use of &quot;Manchuria&quot; as not only inaccurate but giving approval to Japanese colonialism.

===Nurgan===

During the Ming dynasty the area in which the Jurchens lived was referred to as Nurgan.

===Three Provinces===
During the Qing dynasty, the region was known as the &quot;three eastern provinces&quot; (; Manchu, &quot;Dergi Ilan Golo&quot;), which referred to Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Fengtian since 1683 when Jilin and Heilongjiang were separated. However, Jilin and Heilongjiang did not receive the full function of provinces until 1907. The Japanese also used the name &quot;Three Eastern Provinces&quot; (&quot;Tōsanshō&quot;) during the 1920s and 1930s along with &quot;Manshū&quot;. However, after the Manchurian Incident of 1931, &quot;Tōsanshō&quot; was completely replaced by &quot;Manshū&quot; in Japanese usage while the &quot;Three Provinces&quot; and &quot;Northeast&quot; became the orthodox name for the same region in Chinese usage.

===Guandong===
Manchuria has been referred to as &quot;Guandong&quot; (), which literally means &quot;east of the pass&quot;, and similarly &quot;Guanwai&quot; (), a reference to Shanhai Pass in Qinhuangdao in today&#x27;s Hebei, at the eastern end of the Great Wall of China. This usage is seen in the expression &quot;Chuǎng Guāndōng&quot; (literally &quot;Rushing into Guandong&quot;) referring to the mass migration of Han Chinese to Manchuria in the 19th and 20th centuries. The name Guandong later came to be used more narrowly for the area of the Kwantung Leased Territory on the Liaodong Peninsula. It is not to be confused with the southern province of Guangdong.

===Northeast Region===
The term &quot;Manchuria&quot; is deprecated among people of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) due to its association with Japanese imperialism, the puppet state of Manchukuo of the Empire of Japan, and Manchurian nationalism. Official state documents use the term Northeast Region (东北; Dōngběi) to describe the region. Northeast China is predominantly occupied by Han Chinese due to internal Chinese migrations and Sinicization of the Manchus, especially during the Qing dynasty. It is considered the original homeland of several historical groups besides the Manchus, including the Yemaek the Xianbei, the Shiwei, and the Khitans. The area is also home to many Mongols and Hui.

In present-day Chinese, an inhabitant of the Northeast is a &quot;Northeasterner&quot; (). &quot;The Northeast&quot; is a term that expresses the entire region, encompassing its history and various cultures. It is usually restricted to the &quot;Three East Provinces&quot; or &quot;Three Northeast Provinces&quot;, excluding northeastern Inner Mongolia. In China, the term Manchuria () is rarely used today, and the term is often negatively associated with the Japanese imperial legacy and the puppet state of Manchukuo. The &quot;Northeast&quot; (&quot;Tōhoku&quot;) was also used as a name for Manchuria by the Japanese during the 1920s and 1930s.

== Geography and climate ==

Manchuria consists mainly of the northern side of the funnel-shaped North China Craton, a large area of tilled and overlaid Precambrian rocks spanning . The North China Craton was an independent continent before the Triassic period and is known to have been the northernmost piece of land in the world during the Carboniferous. The Greater Khingan in the west is a Jurassic mountain range formed by the collision of the North China Craton with the Siberian Craton, which marked the final stage of the formation of the supercontinent Pangaea.

No part of Manchuria was glaciated during the Quaternary, but the surface geology of most of the lower-lying and more fertile parts of Manchuria consists of very deep layers of loess, which have been formed by the wind-borne movement of dust and till particles formed in glaciated parts of the Himalayas, Kunlun Mountains and Tian Shan, as well as the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts. Soils are mostly fertile mollisols and fluvents except in the more mountainous parts where they have poorly developed orthents, as well as in the extreme north where permafrost occurs and orthels dominate.

The climate of Manchuria has extreme seasonal contrasts, ranging from humid, almost tropical heat in summer to windy, dry, Arctic cold in winter. This pattern occurs because the position of Manchuria on the boundary between the great Eurasian continental landmass and the huge Pacific Ocean causes complete monsoonal wind reversal.

In summer, when the land heats faster than the ocean, low-pressure forms over Asia and warm, moist south to southeasterly winds bring heavy, thundery rain, yielding annual rainfall ranging from , or less in the west, to over in the Changbai Mountains. Temperatures in summer are very warm to hot, with July average maxima ranging from in the south to in the extreme north.

In winter, however, the vast Siberian High causes very cold, north-to-northwesterly winds that bring temperatures as low as in the extreme south and in the north where the zone of discontinuous permafrost reaches northern Heilongjiang. However, because the winds from Siberia are exceedingly dry, snow falls only on a few days every winter, and it is never heavy. This explains why corresponding latitudes of North America were fully glaciated during glacial periods of the Quaternary while Manchuria, though even colder, always remained too dry to form glaciers – a state of affairs enhanced by stronger westerly winds from the surface of the ice sheet in Europe.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

Manchuria was the homeland of several ethnic groups, including Manchu, Mongols, Koreans, Nanai, Nivkhs, Ulchs, Hui, possibly Turkic peoples, and ethnic Han Chinese in southern Manchuria. Various ethnic groups and their respective kingdoms, including the Sushen, Donghu, Xianbei, Wuhuan, Mohe, Khitan and Jurchens, have risen to power in Manchuria. Koreanic kingdoms such as Gojoseon (before 108 BCE), Buyeo (2nd century BCE to 494 CE) and Goguryeo (37 BCE to 688 CE) also became established in large parts of this area. The Chinese Qin (221–206 BCE), Han (202 BCE–9 CE and 25 CE–220 CE), Cao Wei (220–266), Western Jin (266–316), and Tang (618–690 and 705–907) dynasties controlled parts of Manchuria. Parts of northwestern Manchuria came under the control of the First Turkic Khaganate of 552–603 and of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate of 581–630. Early Manchuria had a mixed economy of hunting, fishing, livestock, and agriculture.

With the Song dynasty (960–1269) to the south, the Khitan people of Inner Mongolia created the Liao dynasty (916–1125) and conquered Outer Mongolia and Manchuria, going on to control the adjacent part of the Sixteen Prefectures in Northern China as well. The Liao dynasty became the first state to control all of Manchuria.

In the early 12th century, the Tungusic Jurchen people, who were Liao&#x27;s tributaries, overthrew the Liao and formed the Jin dynasty (1115–1234), which went on to control parts of Northern China and Mongolia after a series of successful military campaigns. During the Mongol Yuan dynasty rule of China (1271–1368), Manchuria was administered as Liaoyang province. In 1375 Naghachu, a Mongol official of the Mongolia-based Northern Yuan dynasty of 1368–1635 in Liaoyang province invaded Liaodong, but later surrendered to the Ming dynasty in 1387. In order to protect the northern border areas, the Ming dynasty decided to &quot;pacify&quot; the Jurchens in order to deal with its problems with Yuan remnants along its northern border. The Ming solidified control over Manchuria under the Yongle Emperor (), establishing the Nurgan Regional Military Commission of 1409–1435. Starting in the 1580s, a Jianzhou Jurchen chieftain, Nurhaci (1558–1626), started to unify Jurchen tribes of the region. Over the next several decades, the Jurchen took control of most of Manchuria. In 1616 Nurhaci founded the Later Jin dynasty, which later became known as the Qing dynasty. The Qing defeated the Evenk-Daur federation led by the Evenki chief Bombogor and beheaded Bombogor in 1640, with Qing armies massacring and deporting Evenkis and absorbing the survivors into the Banners.

Chinese cultural and religious influence such as Chinese New Year, the &quot;Chinese god&quot;, motifs such as the dragon, spirals, and scrolls, agriculture, husbandry, methods of heating, and material goods such as iron cooking-pots, silk, and cotton spread among the Amur natives including the Udeghes, Ulchis, and Nanais.

In 1644, after peasant rebels sacked the Ming dynasty&#x27;s capital of Beijing, the Jurchens (now called Manchus) allied with Ming general Wu Sangui and seized control of Beijing, overthrowing the short-lived Shun dynasty (1644–1649) and establishing Qing-dynasty rule (1644–1912) over all of China. The Manchu conquest of China involved the deaths of over 25 million people. The Qing dynasty built the Willow Palisade – a system of ditches and embankments – during the later 17th century to restrict the movement of Han civilians into Jilin and Heilongjiang. Only bannermen, including Han bannermen, were allowed to settle in Jilin and Heilongjiang.

After conquering the Ming, the Qing often identified their state as &quot;China&quot; (中國, &quot;Zhongguo&quot;; &quot;Middle Kingdom&quot;), and referred to it as &quot;Dulimbai Gurun&quot; (&quot;Middle Kingdom&quot;) in Manchu. In the &quot;Qing shilu&quot; the lands of the Qing state (including Manchuria and present-day Xinjiang, Mongolia, and Tibet) are thus identified as &quot;the Middle Kingdom&quot; in both the Chinese and Manchu languages in roughly two-thirds of the cases, while the term refers to the traditional Chinese provinces populated by the Han in roughly one third of the cases. It was also common to use &quot;China&quot; (&quot;Zhongguo&quot;, &quot;Dulimbai gurun&quot;) to refer to the Qing in official documents, international treaties, and foreign affairs. In diplomatic documents, the term &quot;Chinese language&quot; (&quot;Dulimbai gurun i bithe&quot;) referred to the Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and the term &quot;Chinese people&quot; (中國人 Zhongguo ren; Manchu: Dulimbai gurun i niyalma) referred to all Han, Manchus, and Mongol subjects of the Qing. The Qing explicitly stated that the lands in Manchuria belonged to &quot;China&quot; (Zhongguo, Dulimbai gurun) in Qing edicts and in the 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk.

===Population change===
The Manchu rules of the Qing dynasty initially prohibited Han Chinese from settling in the region. Despite this restriction, a constant flow of Han Chinese farmers from North China settled there.

Manchu landlords desired Han Chinese peasants to rent their land and to grow grain; most Han Chinese migrants were not evicted as they crossed the Great Wall and Willow Palisade. During the eighteenth century Han Chinese farmed 500,000 hectares of privately owned land in Manchuria and 203,583 hectares of lands which were part of courier stations, noble estates, and Banner lands; in garrisons and towns in Manchuria Han Chinese made up 80% of the population.

The Qing resettled Han Chinese farmers from north China to the area along the Liao River in order to restore the land to cultivation. Han Chinese squatters reclaimed wasteland, and other Han rented land from Manchu landlords.

By the 18th century, despite officially prohibiting Han Chinese settlement on Manchu and Mongol lands, the Qing decided to settle Han refugees from northern China – who were suffering from famine, floods, and drought – into Manchuria and Inner Mongolia, so that Han Chinese farmed 500,000 hectares in Manchuria and tens of thousands of hectares in Inner Mongolia by the 1780s. The Qianlong Emperor () allowed Han Chinese peasants suffering from drought to move into Manchuria despite his having issued edicts in favor of banning them from 1740 to 1776. Han Chinese then streamed into Manchuria, both illegally and legally, over the Great Wall of China and the Willow Palisade. Chinese tenant farmers rented or even claimed title to land from the &quot;imperial estates&quot; and Manchu Bannerlands in the area. Besides moving into the Liao area in southern Manchuria, Han Chinese settled the path linking Jinzhou, Fengtian, Tieling, Changchun, Hulun, and Ningguta during the Qianlong Emperor&#x27;s reign, and Han Chinese had become the majority in urban areas of Manchuria by 1800. To increase the Imperial Treasury&#x27;s revenue, the Qing sold formerly Manchu-only lands along the Sungari to Han Chinese at the beginning of the Daoguang Emperor&#x27;s 1820–1850 reign, and Han Chinese filled up most of Manchuria&#x27;s towns by the 1840s, according to Abbé Huc.

The demographic change was not caused solely by Han migration. Manchus also refused to stay in Manchuria. In the late 18th century, Manchus in Beijing were sent to Manchuria as part of a plan to reduce the burden on the court, but they tried to return by every means possible. With the exception of 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers and their families and a military colony established in the 1850s, Manchuria was devoid of Manchus. By 1900, 15 million of Manchuria&#x27;s 17 million inhabitants were Han Chinese.

===Russian invasions===
The Russian conquest of Siberia was met with indigenous resistance to colonization, but Russian Cossacks crushed the natives. The conquest of Siberia and Manchuria also resulted in the spread of infectious diseases. Historian John F. Richards wrote: &quot;... New diseases weakened and demoralized the indigenous peoples of Siberia. The worst of these was smallpox &quot;because of its swift spread, the high death rates, and the permanent disfigurement of survivors.&quot; ... In the 1690s, smallpox epidemics reduced Yukagir numbers by an estimated 44 percent.&quot; At the behest of people like Vasilii Poyarkov in 1645 and Yerofei Khabarov in 1650, Russian Cossacks killed some peoples like the Daur people of Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang to the extent that some authors speak of genocide.
The Daurs initially deserted their villages since they had heard about the cruelty of the Russians the first time Khabarov came. The second time he came, the Daurs decided to do battle against the Russians instead, but were slaughtered by Russian guns. The Russians came to be known as &quot;red-beards&quot;. The Amur natives called Russian Cossacks &quot;luocha&quot; (羅剎), after demons in Buddhist mythology, because of their cruelty towards the Amur tribespeople, who were subjects of the Qing. The Qing viewed Russian proselytization of Eastern Orthodox Christianity to the indigenous peoples along the Amur River as a threat.

In 1858 Russian diplomacy forced a weakening Qing dynasty to cede Manchuria north of the Amur to Russia under the Treaty of Aigun. In 1860, with the Treaty of Peking, the Russians managed to obtain a further large slice of Manchuria, east of the Ussuri River. As a result, Manchuria became divided into a Russian half (known as Outer Manchuria or Russian Manchuria), and a remaining Chinese region (known as Manchuria). In modern literature, &quot;Manchuria&quot; usually refers to Manchuria in China. As a result of the Treaties of Aigun and Peking, Qing China lost access to the Sea of Japan.

=== History after 1860 ===
To counter the increasing influence of Meiji era Japan in the region, the Qing granted Russia the right to construct railways in Manchuria, including the Chinese Eastern Railway in 1896.

In the &quot;Chuang Guandong&quot; movement, many Han farmers, mostly from the Shandong peninsula moved there. By 1921, Harbin, northern Manchuria&#x27;s largest city, had a population of 300,000, including 100,000 Russians. Japan replaced Russian influence in the southern half of Manchuria as a result of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904–1905. Most of the southern branch of the Chinese Eastern Railway was transferred from Russia to Japan, and became the South Manchurian Railway. Japanese influence extended into Outer Manchuria in the wake of the Russian Revolution of 1917, but Outer Manchuria had reverted to Soviet control by 1925. Manchuria was an important region due to its rich natural resources including coal, fertile soil, and various minerals. For pre–World War II Japan, Manchuria was an essential source of raw materials. Without occupying Manchuria, the Japanese probably could not have carried out their plan for conquest over Southeast Asia or taken the risk of attacking the United States and the British Empire in 1941.

There was a major epidemic known as the Manchurian plague in 1910–1911, likely caused by the inexperienced hunting of marmots, many of whom are diseased. The cheap railway transport and the harsh winters, where the hunters sheltered in close confinement, helped to propagate the disease. The response required close coordination between the Chinese, Russian and Japanese authorities and international disease experts held an &#x27;International Plague Conference&#x27; in the northern city of Shenyang after the disease was under control to learn the lessons.

In 1915, Japan forced China to cede economic privileges in Manchuria to Japan, including concessions in Anshan.

It was reported that among Banner people, both Manchu and Chinese (Hanjun) in Aihun, Heilongjiang in the 1920s, would seldom marry with Han civilians, but they (Manchu and Chinese Bannermen) would mostly intermarry with each other. Owen Lattimore reported that during his January 1930 visit to Manchuria, he studied a community in Jilin (Kirin), where both Manchu and Chinese Bannermen were settled at a town called Wulakai, and eventually the Chinese Bannermen there could not be differentiated from Manchus since they were effectively Manchufied (assimilated). The Han civilian population was in the process of absorbing and mixing with them when Lattimore wrote his article.


Around the time of World War I, Zhang Zuolin established himself as a powerful warlord with influence over most of Manchuria. Zhang established an autonomous rule that nominally acknowledged the Republic of China (ROC). Japan co-opted Zhang and retained its semi-colonial economic privileges. During Zhang&#x27;s rule, the Manchurian economy grew tremendously, backed by the immigration of Chinese from other parts of China. After Zhang was defeated in the Northern Expedition and retreated back to Manchuria from Beijing, Japanese army officers assassinated him on 2 June 1928, in what is known as the Huanggutun Incident. These Japanese officers sought for Japan to take direct control of Manchuria, but the Japanese government did not support the plan. Zhang&#x27;s son Zhang Xueliang became Manchuria&#x27;s new ruler. He directed public funds towards the development of Chinese industrial enterprises in the region.

Following the Mukden Incident in 1931 and the subsequent Japanese invasion of Manchuria, the Japanese declared Manchuria an &quot;independent state&quot;, and appointed the deposed Qing emperor Puyi as puppet emperor of Manchukuo. Under Japanese control, Manchuria was brutally run, with a systematic campaign of terror and intimidation against the local populations including arrests, organised riots and other forms of subjugation. Manchukuo was used by Japan as a base to invade the rest of China. At that time, hundreds of thousands of Japanese settlers arrived in Manchuria.

At the Yalta Conference in February 1945, Joseph Stalin agreed that the Soviet Union would declare war on Japan within three months after Germany surrendered, and the USA and UK agreed that the Soviet Union could pursue its claimed interests in Manchuria. Accordingly, in August the Soviet Union issued its declaration of war and launched the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. Soviet forces controlled Manchuria until they left in Spring 1946. Afterwards, China&#x27;s Nationalist government took control of Manchuria. Soon afterwards, the Chinese Communist Party and the Nationalists started fighting for control over Manchuria. The communists won in the Liaoshen Campaign. With the encouragement of the Soviet Union, Manchuria was then used as a staging ground during the Chinese Civil War for the Chinese Communist Party, which emerged victorious in 1949. Ambiguities in the treaties that ceded Outer Manchuria to Russia led to disputes over the political status of several islands. The Kuomintang government in Taiwan (Formosa) complained to the United Nations, which passed resolution 505 on 1 February 1952, denouncing Soviet actions over the violations of the 1945 Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance.

=== People&#x27;s Republic of China ===
The historical region of Manchuria is composed of the provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang.

Manchuria was a central focus of China&#x27;s approach to &quot;socialist industrialization&quot; following the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Strongly influenced by the Soviet approach to industrialization, development policy focused on heavy-industry state-owned enterprises, such as Angang in Anshan. The discovery and development of Daqing oil field made Manchuria the center of China&#x27;s oil industry beginning in the 1960s.

During the Third Front Construction, the region was a major supplier of staff for the newly developed industrial bases in China&#x27;s interior.

The Sino-Soviet split led to the Sino-Soviet border conflict, which ultimately resulted in an agreement. In 2004, Russia agreed to transfer Yinlong Island and one half of Heixiazi Island to China, ending an enduring border dispute.

<text>The Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) was an organization founded on March 15, 1995, by the United States, South Korea, and Japan to implement the 1994 U.S.-North Korea Agreed Framework that froze North Korea&#x27;s indigenous nuclear power plant development centered at the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center, that was suspected of being a step in a nuclear weapons program.
KEDO&#x27;s principal activity was to construct two light water reactor nuclear power plants in North Korea to replace North Korea&#x27;s Magnox type reactors. The original target year for completion was 2003.

Since then, other members joined:
* 1995: Australia, Canada, New Zealand
* 1996: Argentina, Chile, Indonesia
* 1997: European Union, Poland
* 1999: Czech Republic
* 2000: Uzbekistan

KEDO discussions took place at the level of a U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, South Korea&#x27;s deputy foreign minister, and the head of the Asian bureau of Japan&#x27;s Foreign Ministry.

The KEDO Secretariat was located in New York. KEDO was shut down in 2006.

==History==

Formal ground breaking on the site for two light water reactors (LWR) was on August 19, 1997, at Kumho, 30 km north of Sinpo. The Kumho site had been previously selected for two similar sized reactors that had been promised in the 1980s by the Soviet Union, before its collapse.

Soon after the Agreed Framework was signed, U.S. Congress control changed to the Republican Party, who did not support the agreement. Some Republican Senators were strongly against the agreement, regarding it as appeasement. KEDO&#x27;s first director, Stephen Bosworth, later commented &quot;The Agreed Framework was a political orphan within two weeks after its signature&quot;.

Arranging project financing was not easy, and formal invitations to bid were not issued until 1998, by which time the delays were infuriating North Korea. Significant spending on the LWR project did not commence until 2000, with &quot;First Concrete&quot; pouring at the construction site on August 7, 2002. Construction of both reactors was well behind the original schedule.

In the wake of the breakdown of the Agreed Framework in 2003, KEDO largely lost its function. KEDO ensured that the nuclear power plant project assets at the construction site at Kumho in North Korea and at manufacturers&#x27; facilities around the world ($1.5 billion invested to date) were preserved and maintained. The project was reported to be about 30% complete. One reactor containment building was about 50% complete and another about 15% finished. No key equipment for the reactors had been moved to the site.

In 2005, there were reports indicating that KEDO had agreed in principle to terminate the light-water reactor project. On January 9, 2006, it was announced that the project was over and the workers would be returning to their home countries. North Korea demanded compensation and has refused to return the approximately $45 million worth of equipment left behind.

<text>In mathematics, a simple group is a nontrivial group whose only normal subgroups are the trivial group and the group itself. A group that is not simple can be broken into two smaller groups, namely a nontrivial normal subgroup and the corresponding quotient group. This process can be repeated, and for finite groups one eventually arrives at uniquely determined simple groups, by the Jordan–Hölder theorem.

The complete classification of finite simple groups, completed in 2004, is a major milestone in the history of mathematics.

== Examples ==

=== Finite simple groups ===
The cyclic group formula_1 of congruence classes modulo 3 (see modular arithmetic) is simple. If formula_2 is a subgroup of this group, its order (the number of elements) must be a divisor of the order of formula_3 which is 3. Since 3 is prime, its only divisors are 1 and 3, so either formula_2 is formula_3, or formula_2 is the trivial group. On the other hand, the group formula_7 is not simple. The set formula_2 of congruence classes of 0, 4, and 8 modulo 12 is a subgroup of order 3, and it is a normal subgroup since any subgroup of an abelian group is normal. Similarly, the additive group of the integers formula_9 is not simple; the set of even integers is a non-trivial proper normal subgroup.

One may use the same kind of reasoning for any abelian group, to deduce that the only simple abelian groups are the cyclic groups of prime order. The classification of nonabelian simple groups is far less trivial. The smallest nonabelian simple group is the alternating group formula_10 of order 60, and every simple group of order 60 is isomorphic to formula_10. The second smallest nonabelian simple group is the projective special linear group PSL(2,7) of order 168, and every simple group of order 168 is isomorphic to PSL(2,7).

=== Infinite simple groups ===
The infinite alternating group formula_12, i.e. the group of even finitely supported permutations of the integers, is simple. This group can be written as the increasing union of the finite simple groups formula_13 with respect to standard embeddings formula_14. Another family of examples of infinite simple groups is given by formula_15, where formula_16 is an infinite field and formula_17.

It is much more difficult to construct &quot;finitely generated&quot; infinite simple groups. The first existence result is non-explicit; it is due to Graham Higman and consists of simple quotients of the Higman group. Explicit examples, which turn out to be finitely presented, include the infinite Thompson groups formula_18 and formula_19. Finitely presented torsion-free infinite simple groups were constructed by Burger and Mozes.

== Classification ==
There is as yet no known classification for general (infinite) simple groups, and no such classification is expected. One reason for this is the existence of continuum-many Tarski monster groups for every sufficiently-large prime characteristic, each simple and having only the cyclic group of that characteristic as its subgroups.

=== Finite simple groups ===
The finite simple groups are important because in a certain sense they are the &quot;basic building blocks&quot; of all finite groups, somewhat similar to the way prime numbers are the basic building blocks of the integers. This is expressed by the Jordan–Hölder theorem which states that any two composition series of a given group have the same length and the same factors, up to permutation and isomorphism. In a huge collaborative effort, the classification of finite simple groups was declared accomplished in 1983 by Daniel Gorenstein, though some problems surfaced (specifically in the classification of quasithin groups, which were plugged in 2004).

Briefly, finite simple groups are classified as lying in one of 18 families, or being one of 26 exceptions:
* formula_20 – cyclic group of prime order
* formula_13 – alternating group for formula_22
*:The alternating groups may be considered as groups of Lie type over the field with one element, which unites this family with the next, and thus all families of non-abelian finite simple groups may be considered to be of Lie type.
* One of 16 families of groups of Lie type or their derivatives
*:The Tits group is generally considered of this form, though strictly speaking it is not of Lie type, but rather index 2 in a group of Lie type.
* One of 26 exceptions, the sporadic groups, of which 20 are subgroups or subquotients of the monster group and are referred to as the &quot;Happy Family&quot;, while the remaining 6 are referred to as pariahs.

== Structure of finite simple groups ==
The famous theorem of Feit and Thompson states that every group of odd order is solvable. Therefore, every finite simple group has even order unless it is cyclic of prime order.

The Schreier conjecture asserts that the group of outer automorphisms of every finite simple group is solvable. This can be proved using the classification theorem.

== History for finite simple groups ==
There are two threads in the history of finite simple groups – the discovery and construction of specific simple groups and families, which took place from the work of Galois in the 1820s to the construction of the Monster in 1981; and proof that this list was complete, which began in the 19th century, most significantly took place 1955 through 1983 (when victory was initially declared), but was only generally agreed to be finished in 2004. By 2018, its publication was envisioned as a series of 12 monographs, the tenth of which was published in 2023. See for 19th century history of simple groups.

=== Construction ===
Simple groups have been studied at least since early Galois theory, where Évariste Galois realized that the fact that the alternating groups on five or more points are simple (and hence not solvable), which he proved in 1831, was the reason that one could not solve the quintic in radicals. Galois also constructed the projective special linear group of a plane over a prime finite field, , and remarked that they were simple for &quot;p&quot; not 2 or 3. This is contained in his last letter to Chevalier, and are the next example of finite simple groups.

The next discoveries were by Camille Jordan in 1870. Jordan had found 4 families of simple matrix groups over finite fields of prime order, which are now known as the classical groups.

At about the same time, it was shown that a family of five groups, called the Mathieu groups and first described by Émile Léonard Mathieu in 1861 and 1873, were also simple. Since these five groups were constructed by methods which did not yield infinitely many possibilities, they were called &quot;sporadic&quot; by William Burnside in his 1897 textbook.

Later Jordan&#x27;s results on classical groups were generalized to arbitrary finite fields by Leonard Dickson, following the classification of complex simple Lie algebras by Wilhelm Killing. Dickson also constructed exception groups of type G2 and E6 as well, but not of types F4, E7, or E8 . In the 1950s the work on groups of Lie type was continued, with Claude Chevalley giving a uniform construction of the classical groups and the groups of exceptional type in a 1955 paper. This omitted certain known groups (the projective unitary groups), which were obtained by &quot;twisting&quot; the Chevalley construction. The remaining groups of Lie type were produced by Steinberg, Tits, and Herzig (who produced 3&quot;D&quot;4(&quot;q&quot;) and 2&quot;E&quot;6(&quot;q&quot;)) and by Suzuki and Ree (the Suzuki–Ree groups).

These groups (the groups of Lie type, together with the cyclic groups, alternating groups, and the five exceptional Mathieu groups) were believed to be a complete list, but after a lull of almost a century since the work of Mathieu, in 1964 the first Janko group was discovered, and the remaining 20 sporadic groups were discovered or conjectured in 1965–1975, culminating in 1981, when Robert Griess announced that he had constructed Bernd Fischer&#x27;s &quot;Monster group&quot;. The Monster is the largest sporadic simple group having order of 808,017,424,794,512,875,886,459,904,961,710,757,005,754,368,000,000,000. The Monster has a faithful 196,883-dimensional representation in the 196,884-dimensional Griess algebra, meaning that each element of the Monster can be expressed as a 196,883 by 196,883 matrix.

=== Classification ===
The full classification is generally accepted as beginning with the Feit–Thompson theorem of 1962–1963 and being completed in 2004.

Soon after the construction of the Monster in 1981, a proof, totaling more than 10,000 pages, was supplied in 1983 by Daniel Gorenstein, that claimed to successfully list all finite simple groups. This was premature, as gaps were later discovered in the classification of quasithin groups. The gaps were filled in 2004 by a 1300 page classification of quasithin groups and the proof is now generally accepted as complete.

==Tests for nonsimplicity==
&quot;Sylow&#x27;s test&quot;: Let &quot;n&quot; be a positive integer that is not prime, and let &quot;p&quot; be a prime divisor of &quot;n&quot;. If 1 is the only divisor of &quot;n&quot; that is congruent to 1 modulo &quot;p&quot;, then there does not exist a simple group of order &quot;n&quot;.

Proof: If &quot;n&quot; is a prime-power, then a group of order &quot;n&quot; has a nontrivial center and, therefore, is not simple. If &quot;n&quot; is not a prime power, then every Sylow subgroup is proper, and, by Sylow&#x27;s Third Theorem, we know that the number of Sylow &quot;p&quot;-subgroups of a group of order &quot;n&quot; is equal to 1 modulo &quot;p&quot; and divides &quot;n&quot;. Since 1 is the only such number, the Sylow &quot;p&quot;-subgroup is unique, and therefore it is normal. Since it is a proper, non-identity subgroup, the group is not simple.

&quot;Burnside&quot;: A non-Abelian finite simple group has order divisible by at least three distinct primes. This follows from Burnside&#x27;s theorem.

<doc id="47607" wikidata="Q12570" url="?curid=47607" title="Suspension bridge">
<text>A suspension bridge is a type of bridge in which the deck is hung below suspension cables on vertical suspenders. The first modern examples of this type of bridge were built in the early 1800s. Simple suspension bridges, which lack vertical suspenders, have a long history in many mountainous parts of the world.

Besides the bridge type most commonly called suspension bridges, covered in this article, there are other types of suspension bridges. The type covered here has cables suspended between towers, with vertical &quot;suspender cables&quot; that transfer the live and dead loads of the deck below, upon which traffic crosses. This arrangement allows the deck to be level or to arc upward for additional clearance. Like other suspension bridge types, this type often is constructed without the use of falsework.

The suspension cables must be anchored at each end of the bridge, since any load applied to the bridge is transformed into tension in these main cables. The main cables continue beyond the pillars to deck-level supports, and further continue to connections with anchors in the ground. The roadway is supported by vertical suspender cables or rods, called hangers. In some circumstances, the towers may sit on a bluff or canyon edge where the road may proceed directly to the main span. Otherwise, the bridge will typically have two smaller spans, running between either pair of pillars and the highway, which may be supported by suspender cables or their own trusswork. In cases where trusswork supports the spans, there will be very little arc in the outboard main cables.

==History==
The earliest suspension bridges were ropes slung across a chasm, with a deck possibly at the same level or hung below the ropes such that the rope had a catenary shape.

===Precursors===

The Tibetan siddha and bridge-builder Thangtong Gyalpo originated the use of iron chains in his version of simple suspension bridges. In 1433, Gyalpo built eight bridges in eastern Bhutan. The last surviving chain-linked bridge of Gyalpo&#x27;s was the Thangtong Gyalpo Bridge in Duksum en route to Trashi Yangtse, which was finally washed away in 2004. Gyalpo&#x27;s iron chain bridges did not include a suspended-deck bridge, which is the standard on all modern suspension bridges today. Instead, both the railing and the walking layer of Gyalpo&#x27;s bridges used wires. The stress points that carried the screed were reinforced by the iron chains. Before the use of iron chains it is thought that Gyalpo used ropes from twisted willows or yak skins. He may have also used tightly bound cloth.

The Inca used rope bridges, documented as early as 1615. It is not known when they were first made. Queshuachaca is considered the last remaining Inca rope bridge and is rebuilt annually.

===Chain bridges===
The first iron chain suspension bridge in the Western world was the Jacob&#x27;s Creek Bridge (1801) in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, designed by inventor James Finley. Finley&#x27;s bridge was the first to incorporate all of the necessary components of a modern suspension bridge, including a suspended deck which hung by trusses. Finley patented his design in 1808, and published it in the Philadelphia journal, The Port Folio, in 1810.

Early British chain bridges included the Dryburgh Abbey Bridge (1817) and 137 m Union Bridge (1820), with spans rapidly increasing to 176 m with the Menai Bridge (1826), &quot;the first important modern suspension bridge&quot;. The first chain bridge on the German speaking territories was the Chain Bridge in Nuremberg. The Sagar Iron Suspension Bridge with a 200 feet span (also termed Beose Bridge) was constructed near Sagar, India during 1828–1830 by Duncan Presgrave, Mint and Assay Master. The Clifton Suspension Bridge (designed in 1831, completed in 1864 with a 214 m central span), is similar to the Sagar bridge. It is one of the longest of the parabolic arc chain type. The current Marlow suspension bridge was designed by William Tierney Clark and was built between 1829 and 1832, replacing a wooden bridge further downstream which collapsed in 1828. It is the only suspension bridge across the non-tidal Thames. The Széchenyi Chain Bridge, (designed in 1840, opened in 1849), spanning the River Danube in Budapest, was also designed by William Clark and it is a larger-scale version of Marlow Bridge.
One variation is the Thornewill and Warham&#x27;s Ferry Bridge in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire (1889), where the chains are not attached to abutments as is usual, but instead are attached to the main girders, which are thus in compression. Here, the chains are made from flat wrought iron plates, eight inches (203 mm) wide by an inch and a half (38 mm) thick, rivetted together.

===Wire-cable===
 The first wire-cable suspension bridge was the Spider Bridge at Falls of Schuylkill (1816), a modest and temporary footbridge built following the collapse of James Finley&#x27;s nearby Chain Bridge at Falls of Schuylkill (1808). The footbridge&#x27;s span was 124 m, although its deck was only 0.45 m wide.
Development of wire-cable suspension bridges dates to the temporary simple suspension bridge at Annonay built by Marc Seguin and his brothers in 1822. It spanned only 18 m. The first permanent wire cable suspension bridge was Guillaume Henri Dufour&#x27;s Saint Antoine Bridge in Geneva of 1823, with two 40 m spans. The first with cables assembled in mid-air in the modern method was Joseph Chaley&#x27;s Grand Pont Suspendu in Fribourg, in 1834.

In the United States, the first major wire-cable suspension bridge was the Wire Bridge at Fairmount in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Designed by Charles Ellet Jr. and completed in 1842, it had a span of 109 m. Ellet&#x27;s Niagara Falls suspension bridge (1847–48) was abandoned before completion. It was used as scaffolding for John A. Roebling&#x27;s double decker railroad and carriage bridge (1855).

The Otto Beit Bridge (1938–1939) was the first modern suspension bridge outside the United States built with parallel wire cables.

==Structure==
===Bridge main components===
Two towers/pillars, two suspension cables, four suspension cable anchors, multiple suspender cables, the bridge deck.

===Structural analysis=== 
The main cables of a suspension bridge will form a catenary when hanging under their own weight only. When supporting the deck, the cables will instead form a parabola, assuming the weight of the cables is small compared to the weight of the deck. One can see the shape from the constant increase of the gradient of the cable with linear (deck) distance, this increase in gradient at each connection with the deck providing a net upward support force. Combined with the relatively simple constraints placed upon the actual deck, that makes the suspension bridge much simpler to design and analyze than a cable-stayed bridge in which the deck is in compression.

=== Comparison with cable-stayed bridge ===
Cable-stayed bridges and suspension bridges may appear to be similar, but are quite different in principle and in their construction.

In suspension bridges, large main cables (normally two) hang between the towers and are anchored at each end to the ground. The main cables, which are free to move on bearings in the towers, bear the load of the bridge deck. Before the deck is installed, the cables are under tension from their own weight. Along the main cables smaller cables or rods connect to the bridge deck, which is lifted in sections. As this is done, the tension in the cables increases, as it does with the live load of traffic crossing the bridge. The tension on the main cables is transferred to the ground at the anchorages and by downwards compression on the towers.

In cable-stayed bridges, the towers are the primary load-bearing structures that transmit the bridge loads to the ground. A cantilever approach is often used to support the bridge deck near the towers, but lengths further from them are supported by cables running directly to the towers. By design, all static horizontal forces of the cable-stayed bridge are balanced so that the supporting towers do not tend to tilt or slide and so must only resist horizontal forces from the live loads.

===Advantages===
* Longer main spans are achievable than with any other type of bridge.
* Less material may be required than other bridge types, even at spans they can achieve, leading to a reduced construction cost.
* Except for installation of the initial temporary cables, little or no access from below is required during construction and so a waterway can remain open while the bridge is built above.
* They may be better able to withstand earthquake movements than heavier and more rigid bridges.
* Bridge decks can have deck sections replaced in order to widen traffic lanes for larger vehicles or add additional width for separated cycling/pedestrian paths.

===Disadvantages===
* Considerable stiffness or aerodynamic profiling may be required to prevent the bridge deck from vibrating under high winds.
* The relatively low deck stiffness compared to other (non-suspension) types of bridges makes it more difficult to carry heavy rail traffic in which high concentrated live loads occur.
* Some access below may be required during construction to lift the initial cables or to lift deck units. That access can often be avoided in cable-stayed bridge construction.

==Variations==
===Underspanned===
In an underspanned suspension bridge, also called under-deck cable-stayed bridge, the main cables hang entirely below the bridge deck, but are still anchored into the ground in a similar way to the conventional type. Very few bridges of this nature have been built, as the deck is inherently less stable than when suspended below the cables. Examples include the Pont des Bergues of 1834 designed by Guillaume Henri Dufour; James Smith&#x27;s Micklewood Bridge; and a proposal by Robert Stevenson for a bridge over the River Almond near Edinburgh.

Roebling&#x27;s Delaware Aqueduct (begun 1847) consists of three sections supported by cables. The timber structure essentially hides the cables; and from a quick view, it is not immediately apparent that it is even a suspension bridge.

===Suspension cable types===
The main suspension cables in older bridges were often made from a chain or linked bars, but modern bridge cables are made from multiple strands of wire. This not only adds strength but improves reliability (often called redundancy in engineering terms) because the failure of a few flawed strands in the hundreds used pose very little threat of failure, whereas a single bad link or eyebar can cause failure of an entire bridge. (The failure of a single eyebar was found to be the cause of the collapse of the Silver Bridge over the Ohio River.) Another reason is that as spans increased, engineers were unable to lift larger chains into position, whereas wire strand cables can be formulated one by one in mid-air from a temporary walkway.

====Suspender-cable terminations====
Poured sockets are used to make a high strength, permanent cable termination. They are created by inserting the suspender wire rope (at the bridge deck supports) into the narrow end of a conical cavity which is oriented in-line with the intended direction of strain. The individual wires are splayed out inside the cone or &#x27;capel&#x27;, and the cone is then filled with molten lead-antimony-tin (Pb80Sb15Sn5) solder.

===Deck structure types===
Most suspension bridges have open truss structures to support the roadbed, particularly owing to the unfavorable effects of using plate girders, discovered from the Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940) bridge collapse. In the 1960s, developments in bridge aerodynamics allowed the re-introduction of plate structures as shallow box girders, first seen on the Severn bridge, built 1961–1966. In the picture of the Yichang Bridge, note the very sharp entry edge and sloping undergirders in the suspension bridge shown. This enables this type of construction to be used without the danger of vortex shedding and consequent aeroelastic effects, such as those that destroyed the original Tacoma Narrows bridge.

== Forces ==
Three kinds of forces operate on any bridge: the dead load, the live load, and the dynamic load. Dead load refers to the weight of the bridge itself. Like any other structure, a bridge has a tendency to collapse simply because of the gravitational forces acting on the materials of which the bridge is made. Live load refers to traffic that moves across the bridge as well as normal environmental factors such as changes in temperature, precipitation, and winds. Dynamic load refers to environmental factors that go beyond normal weather conditions, factors such as sudden gusts of wind and earthquakes. All three factors must be taken into consideration when building a bridge.

===Use other than road and rail===
The principles of suspension used on a large scale also appear in contexts less dramatic than road or rail bridges. Light cable suspension may prove less expensive and seem more elegant for a cycle or footbridge than strong girder supports. An example of this is the Nescio Bridge in the Netherlands, and the Roebling designed 1904 Riegelsville suspension pedestrian bridge across the Delaware River in Pennsylvania. The longest pedestrian suspension bridge, which spans the River Paiva, Arouca Geopark, Portugal, opened in April 2021. The 516 metres bridge hangs 175 meters above the river.

Where such a bridge spans a gap between two buildings, there is no need to construct towers, as the buildings can anchor the cables. Cable suspension may also be augmented by the inherent stiffness of a structure that has much in common with a tubular bridge.

==Construction sequence (wire strand cable type)==

Typical suspension bridges are constructed using a sequence generally described as follows. Depending on length and size, construction may take anywhere between a year and a half (construction on the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge took only 19 months) up to as long as a decade (the Akashi-Kaikyō Bridge&#x27;s construction began in May 1986 and was opened in May 1998 – a total of twelve years).
#Where the towers are founded on underwater piers, &quot; caissons&quot; are sunk and any soft bottom is excavated for a foundation. If the bedrock is too deep to be exposed by excavation or the sinking of a caisson, pilings are driven to the bedrock or into overlying hard soil, or a large concrete pad to distribute the weight over less resistant soil may be constructed, first preparing the surface with a bed of compacted gravel. (Such a pad footing can also accommodate the movements of an active fault, and this has been implemented on the foundations of the cable-stayed Rio-Antirio bridge.) The piers are then extended above water level, where they are capped with pedestal bases for the towers.
#Where the towers are founded on dry land, deep foundation excavation or pilings are used.
#From the tower foundation, towers of single or multiple columns are erected using high-strength reinforced concrete, stonework, or steel. Concrete is used most frequently in modern suspension bridge construction due to the high cost of steel.
#Large devices called &quot;saddles&quot;, which will carry the main suspension cables, are positioned atop the towers. Typically of cast steel, they can also be manufactured using riveted forms, and are equipped with rollers to allow the main cables to shift under construction and normal loads.
#&quot; Anchorages&quot; are constructed, usually in tandem with the towers, to resist the tension of the cables and form as the main anchor system for the entire structure. These are usually anchored in good quality rock but may consist of massive reinforced concrete deadweights within an excavation. The anchorage structure will have multiple protruding open &quot;eyebolts&quot; enclosed within a secure space.
#Temporary suspended walkways, called &quot;catwalks&quot;, are then erected using a set of guide wires hoisted into place via winches positioned atop the towers. These catwalks follow the curve set by bridge designers for the main cables, in a path mathematically described as a catenary arc. Typical catwalks are usually between eight and ten feet wide and are constructed using wire grate and wood slats.
#Gantries are placed upon the catwalks, which will support the main cable spinning reels. Then, cables attached to winches are installed, and in turn, the main cable spinning devices are installed.
#High strength wire (typically 4 or 6 gauge galvanized steel wire), is pulled in a loop by pulleys on the traveler, with one end affixed at an anchorage. When the traveler reaches the opposite anchorage the loop is placed over an open anchor eyebar. Along the catwalk, workers also pull the cable wires to their desired tension. This continues until a bundle, called a &quot;cable strand&quot; is completed, and temporarily bundled using stainless steel wire. This process is repeated until the final cable strand is completed. Workers then remove the individual wraps on the cable strands (during the spinning process, the shape of the main cable closely resembles a hexagon), and then the entire cable is then compressed by a traveling hydraulic press into a closely packed cylinder and tightly wrapped with additional wire to form the final circular cross-section. The wire used in suspension bridge construction is a galvanized steel wire that has been coated with corrosion inhibitors.
#At specific points along the main cable (each being the exact distance horizontally in relation to the next) devices called &quot;cable bands&quot; are installed to carry steel wire ropes called &quot;Suspender cables.&quot; Each suspender cable is engineered and cut to precise lengths, and are looped over the cable bands. In some bridges, where the towers are close to or on the shore, the suspender cables may be applied only to the central span. Early suspender cables were fitted with zinc jewels and a set of steel washers, which formed the support for the deck. Modern suspender cables carry a shackle-type fitting.
#Special lifting hoists attached to the suspenders or from the main cables are used to lift prefabricated sections of the bridge deck to the proper level, provided that the local conditions allow the sections to be carried below the bridge by barge or other means. Otherwise, a traveling cantilever derrick may be used to extend the deck one section at a time starting from the towers and working outward. If the addition of the deck structure extends from the towers the finished portions of the deck will pitch upward rather sharply, as there is no downward force in the center of the span. Upon completion of the deck, the added load will pull the main cables into an arc mathematically described as a parabola, while the arc of the deck will be as the designer intended – usually a gentle upward arc for added clearance if over a shipping channel, or flat in other cases such as a span over a canyon. Arched suspension spans also give the structure more rigidity and strength.
#With the completion of the primary structure various details such as lighting, handrails, finish painting and paving is installed or completed.

==Longest spans==

Suspension bridges are typically ranked by the length of their main span. These are the ten bridges with the longest spans, followed by the length of the span and the year the bridge opened for traffic:
==Other examples==
(Chronological)

* Union Bridge (England/Scotland, 1820), the longest span (137 m) from 1820 to 1826. The oldest suspension bridge in the world still carrying road traffic.
* Roebling&#x27;s Delaware Aqueduct (USA, 1847), the oldest wire suspension bridge still in service in the United States.
* John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge (USA, 1866), then the longest wire suspension bridge in the world at 1,057 feet (322 m) main span.
* Brooklyn Bridge (USA, 1883), the first steel-wire suspension bridge.
* Bear Mountain Bridge (USA, 1924), the longest suspension span (497 m) from 1924 to 1926. The first suspension bridge to have a concrete deck. The construction methods pioneered in building it would make possible several much larger projects to follow.
* Benjamin Franklin Bridge (USA, 1926), replaced Bear Mountain Bridge as the longest span at 1,750 feet between the towers. Includes an active subway line and never-used trolley stations on the span.
* San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge eastern span (USA, 2013). The eastern portion is a self-anchored suspension bridge, the longest of its type in the world. It replaced a cantilever bridge.
* Golden Gate Bridge (USA, 1937), the longest suspension bridge from 1937 to 1964. It was also the world&#x27;s tallest bridge from 1937 to 1993, and remains the tallest bridge in the United States.
* Mackinac Bridge (USA, 1957), the longest suspension bridge between anchorages in the Western hemisphere.
* Si Du River Bridge (China, 2009), the highest bridge in the world, with its deck around 500 meters above the surface of the river.
* Rod El Farag Axis Bridge (Egypt, 2019), a modern Egyptian steel wire-cables based suspension bridge crossing the river Nile, which was completed in 2019 and holds the Guinness World Record for the widest suspension bridge in the world with a width of 67.3 meters, and with a span of 540 meters.

==Notable collapses==
Broughton Suspension Bridge (England) was an iron chain bridge built in 1826. One of Europe&#x27;s first suspension bridges, it collapsed in 1831 due to mechanical resonance induced by troops marching in step. As a result of the incident, the British Army issued an order that troops should &quot;break step&quot; when crossing a bridge.
Silver Bridge (USA) was an eyebar chain highway bridge, built in 1928, that collapsed in late 1967, killing forty-six people. The bridge had a low-redundancy design that was difficult to inspect. The collapse inspired legislation to ensure that older bridges were regularly inspected and maintained. Following the collapse a bridge of similar design was immediately closed and eventually demolished. A second similarly-designed bridge had been built with a higher margin of safety and remained in service until 1991. 

The Tacoma Narrows Bridge, (USA), 1940, was vulnerable to structural vibration in sustained and moderately strong winds due to its plate-girder deck structure. Wind caused a phenomenon called aeroelastic fluttering that led to its collapse only months after completion. The collapse was captured on film. There were no human deaths in the collapse; several drivers escaped their cars on foot and reached the anchorages before the span dropped.

Yarmouth suspension bridge (England) was built in 1829 and collapsed in 1845, killing 79 people.

Peace River Suspension Bridge (Canada), which was completed in 1943, collapsed when the north anchor&#x27;s soil support for the suspension bridge failed in October 1957. The entire bridge subsequently collapsed.

Kutai Kartanegara Bridge (Indonesia) over the Mahakam River, located in Kutai Kartanegara Regency, East Kalimantan district on the Indonesia island of Borneo, was built in 1995, completed in 2001 and collapsed in 2011. Dozens of vehicles on the bridge fell into the Mahakam River. As a result of this incident, 24 people died and dozens of others were injured and were treated at the Aji Muhammad Parikesit Regional Hospital. Meanwhile, 12 people were reported missing, 31 people were seriously injured, and 8 people had minor injuries. Research findings indicate that the collapse was largely caused by the construction failure of the vertical hanging clamp. It was also found that poor maintenance, fatigue in the cable hanger construction materials, material quality, and bridge loads that exceed vehicle capacity, can also have an impact on bridge collapse. In 2013 the Kutai Kartanegara Bridge rebuilt the same location and completed in 2015 with a Through arch bridge design.

On 30 October 2022, Jhulto Pul, a pedestrian suspension bridge over the Machchhu River in the city of Morbi, Gujarat, India collapsed, leading to the deaths of at least 141 people.

<text>The Great Belt Bridge () or Great Belt fixed link () is a multi-element fixed link crossing the Great Belt strait between the Danish islands of Zealand and Funen. It consists of a road suspension bridge and a railway tunnel between Zealand and the small island Sprogø in the middle of the Great Belt, and a box-girder bridge for both road and rail traffic between Sprogø and Funen. The total length is .

The term &quot;Great Belt Bridge&quot; commonly refers to the suspension bridge, although it may also be used to mean the box-girder bridge, especially when discussing the railway, or the link in its entirety. Officially named the East Bridge, the suspension bridge was designed by the Danish firms COWI and Ramboll, and the architecture firm Dissing+Weitling. The construction and assembly of the suspended deck were carried out by the company Alsthom Sdem with the consultancy of the Italian Studio de Miranda Associati under the direction of Mario de Miranda.

It has the world&#x27;s sixth-longest main span (). At the time of the opening of the bridge it was the second longest, beaten by the Akashi Kaikyō Bridge opened a few months previously.

Together with the New Little Belt Bridge, the Great Belt link provides a continuous road and rail connection between Copenhagen and the Danish mainland. The link replaced the Great Belt ferries service, which had been the primary means of crossing the Great Belt. After more than 50 years of debate, the Danish government decided in 1986 to construct a link; it opened to rail traffic in 1997 and to road traffic in 1998. At an estimated cost of DKK 21.4 billion (EUR 2.8 billion) (1988 prices), the link is the largest construction project in Danish history. It has reduced travel times significantly; previously taking one hour by ferry, the Great Belt can now be crossed in ten minutes. This link, together with the Øresund Bridge (built 1995–1999) and the Little Belt Bridge, have together enabled driving from mainland Europe to Sweden through Denmark.

Operation and maintenance are performed by &quot;A/S Storebælt&quot; under &quot;Sund &amp; Bælt&quot;. Construction and maintenance are financed by tolls on vehicles and trains. Cyclists are not permitted to use the bridge, but bicycles may be transported by train or bus.

== History ==
The Great Belt ferries entered service between the coastal towns of Korsør and Nyborg in 1883, connecting the railway lines on either side of the Belt. In 1957, road traffic was moved to the Halsskov–Knudshoved route, about 1.5 kilometres to the north and close to the fixed link.

Construction drafts for a fixed link were presented as early as the 1850s, with several suggestions appearing in the following decades. The Danish State Railways, responsible for the ferry service, presented plans for a bridge in 1934. The concepts of bridges over Øresund (152 million DKK) and Storebælt (257 million DKK) were calculated around 1936. In 1948, the Ministry for Public Works (now the Ministry of Transport) established a commission to investigate the implications of a fixed link.

The first law concerning a fixed link was enacted in 1973, but the project was put on hold in 1978 as the Venstre (Liberal) party demanded postponing public spending. Political agreement to restart work was reached in 1986, with a construction law () being passed in 1987.

The design was carried out by the engineering firms COWI and Ramboll together with Dissing+Weitling architecture practice.

Construction of the link commenced in 1988. In 1991, Finland sued Denmark at the International Court of Justice, on the grounds that Finnish-built mobile offshore drilling units would be unable to pass beneath the bridge. The two countries negotiated a financial compensation of 90 million Danish kroner, and Finland withdrew the lawsuit in 1992.

A European Court of Justice ruling in 1993 found that a contractual condition requiring use of local labour and local materials in constructing the bridge was incompatible with the principles of the EEC Treaty.

The link is estimated to have created a value of 379 billion DKK after 50 years of use.

In 2022, the bridge was crossed as part of the route of Stage 2 of the 2022 Tour de France.
== Construction ==

The construction of the fixed link became the biggest building project in the history of Denmark. In order to connect Halsskov on Zealand with Knudshoved on Funen, to its west, a two-track railway and a four-lane motorway had to be built, via the small island of Sprogø in the middle of the Great Belt. The project comprised three different tasks: the East Bridge for road transport, the East Tunnel for rail transport and the West Bridge for road and rail transport combined. The construction work was carried out by Sundlink Contractors, a consortium of Skanska, Hochtief, Højgaard &amp; Schultz (which built the West Bridge) and Monberg &amp; Thorsen (which built the section under the Great Belt). The work of lifting and placing the elements was carried out by Ballast Nedam using a floating crane.

=== East Bridge ===
Built between 1991 and 1998 at a cost of US$950 million, the East Bridge (&quot;Østbroen&quot;) is a suspension bridge between Halsskov and Sprogø. It is long with a free span of . The East Bridge had been planned to be completed in time to be the longest bridge in the world, but there were delays in construction. Therefore, it happened that the Akashi-Kaikyo Bridge was opened two months earlier.

The vertical clearance for ships is , meaning the world&#x27;s largest cruise ship, an &quot;Oasis&quot;-class cruise ship, just fits under with its smokestack folded. At above sea level, the two pylons of the East Bridge are the highest points on self-supporting structures in Denmark. Some radio masts, such as Tommerup transmitter, are taller.

To keep the main cables tensioned, an anchorage structure on each side of the span is placed below the road deck. After 15 years, the cables have no rust. They were scheduled for a 15 million DKK paint job, but due to corroding cables on other bridges, the decision was made to instead install a 70 million DKK sealed de-humidifying system in the cables. This was carried out by UK engineering firm Spencer Group, with help from Danish subcontractors Davai who provided the manpower, and Belvent A/S who provided the dehumidification system.
Nineteen concrete pillars (12 on the Zealand side, seven by Sprogø), apart, carry the road deck outside the span.

=== West Bridge ===
The West Bridge (&quot;Vestbroen&quot;) is a box girder bridge between Sprogø and Knudshoved. It is long, and has a vertical clearance for ships of . It is actually two separate, adjacent bridges: the northern one carries rail traffic and the southern one road traffic. The pillars of the two bridges rest on common foundations below sea level. The West Bridge was built between 1988 and 1994; its road/rail deck comprises 63 sections, supported by 62 pillars.

=== East Tunnel ===
The twin bored tunnel tubes of the East Tunnel (&quot;Østtunnelen&quot;) are each long. There are 31 connecting tunnels between the two main tunnels, at intervals. The equipment that is necessary for train operation in the tunnels is installed in the connecting tunnels, which also serve as emergency escape routes.

There were delays and cost overruns in the tunnel construction. The plan was to open it in 1993, giving the trains a head start of three years over road traffic, but train traffic started in 1997 and road traffic in 1998. During construction the sea bed gave way and one of the tunnels was flooded. The water continued to rise and reached the end at Sprogø, where it continued into the (still dry) other tunnel. The water damaged two of the four tunnel boring machines, but no workers were injured. Only by placing a clay blanket on the sea bed was it possible to dry out the tunnels. The two damaged machines were repaired and the majority of the tunnelling was undertaken from the Sprogø side. The machines on the Zealand side tunnelled through difficult ground and made little progress. A major fire on one of the Zealand machines in June 1994 stopped these drives and the tunnels were completed by the two Sprogø machines.

A total of 320 compressed air workers were involved in 9,018 pressure exposures in the four tunnel-boring machines. The project had a decompression sickness incidence of 0.14% with two workers having long-term residual symptoms.

== Traffic implications ==


Prior to the opening of the link, an average of 8,000 cars used the ferries across the Great Belt every day. The traffic across the strait increased 127 percent over the first year after the link&#x27;s opening due to the so-called traffic leap: new traffic generated by the improved ease, facility and lower price of crossing the Great Belt.
In 2021, an average of 34,100 vehicles used the link each day. On August 7, 2022 a record 61,528 vehicles passed the bridge in 24 hours. The increase in traffic is partly caused by the general growth of traffic, partly diversion of traffic volume from other services via ferry and services.

The fixed link has produced considerable savings in travel time between eastern and western Denmark. Previously, it took approximately 90 minutes on average to cross the Great Belt in a car with transfer by ferry, including the waiting time at the ports. It took considerably longer during peak periods, such as weekends and holidays. With the opening of the link, the journey is now between 10 and 15 minutes.

By train the time savings are significant as well. The journey has been reduced by 60 minutes, and there are many more seats available because more carriages may be added to a train that does not have to fit on a ferry. The seating capacity offered by DSB across the Great Belt on an ordinary Wednesday has risen from 11,060 seats to 37,490 seats. On Fridays the seating capacity exceeds 40,000 seats.

The shortest travel times are: Copenhagen–Odense 1 hour 15 minutes, Copenhagen–Aarhus 2 hours 30 minutes, Copenhagen–Aalborg 3 hours 55 minutes and Copenhagen–Esbjerg 2 hours 35 minutes.

Flights between Copenhagen and Odense, and between Copenhagen and Esbjerg have ceased, and the train now has the largest market share between Copenhagen and Aarhus.

Together with the Øresund Bridge, and the two Little Belt bridges, the link provides a direct fixed connection between western Continental Europe and northern Scandinavia, eventually connecting all parts of the European Union except Ireland, Malta, Cyprus, and outlying islands. Most people from Zealand still prefer to take the ferry between Puttgarden and Rødby, as it is a much shorter distance and provides a needed break for those travelling a long distance.

For freight trains, the fixed links are a large improvement between Sweden and Germany, and between Sweden and the UK. The Sweden-to-Germany ferry system is still used to some extent owing to limited rail capacity, with heavy passenger traffic over the bridges and some single track stretches in southern Denmark and northern Germany.

The Great Belt was used by now defunct night passenger trains between Copenhagen and Germany, which were too long to fit on the ferries. Day trains on the Copenhagen-Hamburg route first continued to use the Fehmarn Belt ferries, utilising short diesel trains, but now also use the Great Belt route, which potentially allows longer trains to be used, increasing capacity.

By 2028, the Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link is expected to be complete with much of the international traffic being shifted from the Great Belt Fixed Link. This more direct route will reduce the rail journey from Hamburg to Copenhagen from 4:45 to 3:30 hours.

In 2019, the vehicle tolls were:
== Environmental effects ==

Environmental considerations have been an integral part of the project, and have been of decisive significance for the choice of alignment and determination of the design. Great Belt A/S established an environmental monitoring programme in 1988, and initiated co-operation with authorities and external consultants on the definition of environmental concerns during the construction work and the professional requirements to the monitoring programme. This co-operation issued in a report published at the beginning of 1997 on the state of the environment in the Great Belt. The conclusion of the report was that the marine environment was at least as good as before construction work began.

With regards to the water flow, the link must comply with the so-called zero-solution. This has been achieved by deepening parts of the Great Belt, so that the water flow cross section has been increased. This excavation compensates for the blocking effect caused by the bridge pylons and approach ramps. The conclusion of the report is that water flows are now almost at the level they were before the bridge was built.

The fixed link has generated increased road traffic volume, which has meant increased air pollution. However, there has been significant savings in the energy consumption by switching from ferries to the fixed link. Train and car ferries consume much energy for propulsion, high-speed ferries consume large amounts of energy at high speeds, and air transport is highly energy consuming. Domestic air travel over the Great Belt was greatly reduced after the opening of the bridge, with the former air travellers now using trains and private cars.

The larger energy consumption by ferries as opposed to via the fixed link is most clearly seen when comparing short driving distances from areas immediately east or west of the link. For more extended driving distances the difference in energy consumption is smaller, but any transport within Denmark across the link shows very clear energy savings.

During 2009, seven large wind turbines, likely Vestas 3MWs totalling 21MW capacity, were erected in the sea north of Sprogø to contribute to the electrical demand of the Great Belt Link. Their hub heights are about the same level as the road deck of the suspension bridge. Part of the project was to showcase sea wind at the December 2009 Copenhagen climate meeting.

==Accidents==
During construction 479 work-related accidents were reported, of which 53 resulted in serious injuries or death. Seven workers died as a result of work-related accidents.

The West Bridge has been struck by sea traffic twice. While the link was still under construction on 14 September 1993, the ferry M/F Romsø drifted off course in bad weather and hit the West Bridge. At 19:17 on 3 March 2005, the 3,500-ton freighter MV Karen Danielsen crashed into the West Bridge 800 metres from Funen. All traffic across the bridge was halted, effectively cutting Denmark in two. The bridge was re-opened shortly after midnight, after the freighter was pulled free and inspectors had found no structural damage to the bridge.

The East Bridge has so far been in the clear, although on 16 May 2001, the bridge was closed for 10 minutes as the Cambodian 27,000-ton bulk carrier &quot;Bella&quot; was heading straight for one of the anchorage structures. The ship was deflected by a swift response from the navy.

On 5 June 2006, a maintenance vehicle burst into flames in the east-bound railway tunnel at about 21:30. Nobody was hurt; its crew of three fled to the other tunnel and escaped. The fire was put out shortly before midnight, and the vehicle was removed from the tunnel the next day. Train service resumed on 6 June at reduced speed, and normal service was restored on 12 June.

On 2 January 2019, eight people were killed in a train accident on the West Bridge. A passenger train was hit by a semi-trailer that fell off a freight train travelling in the opposite direction.

In 2023, a 57-year-old truck driver was arrested by police after traffic on the bridge was disrupted due to spilled potatoes. Police stated that they were working on the hypothesis that the potatoes were either planted intentionally or as an accident.

== Operations ==

In 2009, a study characterized the rail tunnel (together with other major projects like the Channel Tunnel between England and France) as financially non-viable.

<doc id="47611" wikidata="Q237488" url="?curid=47611" title="Doomsday Clock">
<text>The Doomsday Clock is a symbol that represents the estimated likelihood of a human-made global catastrophe, in the opinion of the members of the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot;. Maintained since 1947, the Clock is a metaphor, not a prediction, for threats to humanity from unchecked scientific and technological advances. That is, the time on the Clock is not to be interpreted as actual time. A hypothetical global catastrophe is represented by midnight on the Clock, with the &quot;Bulletin&quot;″s opinion on how close the world is to one represented by a certain number of minutes or seconds to midnight, which is then assessed in January of each year. The main factors influencing the Clock are nuclear warfare, climate change, and artificial intelligence. The &quot;Bulletin&quot;″s Science and Security Board monitors new developments in the life sciences and technology that could inflict irrevocable harm to humanity.

The Clock&#x27;s original setting in 1947 was 7 minutes to midnight. It has since been set backward 8 times and forward 18 times. The farthest time from midnight was 17 minutes in 1991, and the nearest is 89 seconds, set in January 2025.

The Clock was moved to 150 seconds (2 minutes, 30 seconds) in 2017, then forward to 2 minutes to midnight in 2018, and left unchanged in 2019. It was moved forward to 100 seconds (1 minute, 40 seconds) in 2020, 90 seconds (1 minute, 30 seconds) in 2023, and 89 seconds (1 minute, 29 seconds) in 2025.

==History==

The Doomsday Clock&#x27;s origin can be traced to the international group of researchers called the Chicago Atomic Scientists, who had participated in the Manhattan Project. After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, they began publishing a mimeographed newsletter and then the magazine, &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot;, which, since its inception, has depicted the Clock on every cover. The Clock was first represented in 1947, when the &quot;Bulletin&quot; co-founder Hyman Goldsmith asked artist Martyl Langsdorf (wife of Manhattan Project research associate and Szilárd petition signatory Alexander Langsdorf Jr.) to design a cover for the magazine&#x27;s June 1947 issue. As Eugene Rabinowitch, another co-founder of the &quot;Bulletin&quot;, explained later:

 Langsdorf chose a clock to reflect the urgency of the problem: like a countdown, the Clock suggests that destruction will naturally occur unless someone takes action to stop it.

In January 2007, designer Michael Bierut, who was on the &quot;Bulletin&quot;″s Governing Board, redesigned the Doomsday Clock to give it a more modern feel. In 2009, the &quot;Bulletin&quot; ceased its print edition and became one of the first print publications in the U.S. to become entirely digital; the Clock is now found as part of the logo on the &quot;Bulletin&quot;&#x27;s website. Information about the Doomsday Clock Symposium, a timeline of the Clock&#x27;s settings, and multimedia shows about the Clock&#x27;s history and culture can also be found on the &quot;Bulletin&quot;″s website.

The 5th Doomsday Clock Symposium was held on November 14, 2013, in Washington, D.C.; it was a day-long event that was open to the public and featured panelists discussing various issues on the topic &quot;Communicating Catastrophe&quot;. There was also an evening event at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in conjunction with the Hirshhorn&#x27;s current exhibit, &quot;Damage Control: Art and Destruction Since 1950&quot;. The panel discussions, held at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, were streamed live from the &quot;Bulletin&quot;″s website and can still be viewed there. Reflecting international events dangerous to humankind, the Clock has been adjusted 25 times since its inception in 1947, when it was set to &quot;seven minutes to midnight&quot;.

The Doomsday Clock has become a universally recognized metaphor according to &quot;The Two-Way&quot;, an NPR blog. According to the &quot;Bulletin&quot;, the Clock attracts more daily visitors to the &quot;Bulletin&quot;&#x27;s site than any other feature.

==Basis for settings==
&quot;Midnight&quot; has a deeper meaning besides the constant threat of war. There are various elements taken into consideration when the scientists from the &quot;Bulletin&quot; decide what Midnight and &quot;global catastrophe&quot; really mean in a particular year. They might include &quot;politics, energy, weapons, diplomacy, and climate science&quot;; potential sources of threat include nuclear threats, climate change, bioterrorism, and artificial intelligence. Members of the board judge Midnight by discussing how close they think humanity is to the end of civilization. In 1947, at the beginning of the Cold War, the Clock was started at seven minutes to midnight.

== Fluctuations and threats ==
Before January 2020, the two tied-for-lowest points for the Doomsday Clock were in 1953 (when the Clock was set to two minutes until midnight, after the U.S. and the Soviet Union began testing hydrogen bombs) and in 2018, following the failure of world leaders to address tensions relating to nuclear weapons and climate change issues. In other years, the Clock&#x27;s time has fluctuated from 17 minutes in 1991 to 2 minutes 30 seconds in 2017. Discussing the change in 2017, Lawrence Krauss, one of the scientists from the &quot;Bulletin&quot;, warned that political leaders must make decisions based on facts, and those facts &quot;must be taken into account if the future of humanity is to be preserved&quot;. In an announcement from the &quot;Bulletin&quot; about the status of the Clock, they went as far to call for action from &quot;wise&quot; public officials and &quot;wise&quot; citizens to make an attempt to steer human life away from catastrophe while humans still can.

On January 24, 2018, scientists moved the clock to two minutes to midnight, based on threats greatest in the nuclear realm. The scientists said, of recent moves by North Korea under Kim Jong-un and the administration of Donald Trump in the U.S.: &quot;Hyperbolic rhetoric and provocative actions by both sides have increased the possibility of nuclear war by accident or miscalculation&quot;.

The clock was left unchanged in 2019 due to the twin threats of nuclear weapons and climate change, and the problem of those threats being &quot;exacerbated this past year by the increased use of information warfare to undermine democracy around the world, amplifying risk from these and other threats and putting the future of civilization in extraordinary danger&quot;.

On January 23, 2020, the Clock was moved to 100 seconds (1 minute, 40 seconds) before midnight. The &quot;Bulletin&quot;″s executive chairman, Jerry Brown, said &quot;the dangerous rivalry and hostility among the superpowers increases the likelihood of nuclear blunder... Climate change just compounds the crisis&quot;. The &quot;100 seconds to midnight&quot; setting remained unchanged in 2021 and 2022.

On January 24, 2023, the Clock was moved to 90 seconds (1 minute, 30 seconds) before midnight, which was largely attributed to the risk of nuclear escalation that arose from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Other reasons cited included climate change, biological threats such as COVID-19, and risks associated with disinformation and disruptive technologies. 

On January 28, 2025, the Clock was moved to 89 seconds (1 minute, 29 seconds) before midnight, the closest it has ever been set to midnight since its inception in 1947.

== Criticism ==
In 2016, Anders Sandberg of the Future of Humanity Institute has stated that the &quot;grab bag of threats&quot; currently mixed together by the Clock can induce paralysis. People may be more likely to succeed at smaller, incremental challenges; for example, taking steps to prevent the accidental detonation of nuclear weapons was a small but significant step towards avoiding nuclear war. Alex Barasch in &quot;Slate&quot; argued that &quot;putting humanity on a permanent, blanket high-alert isn&#x27;t helpful when it comes to policy or science&quot; and criticized the &quot;Bulletin&quot; for neither explaining nor attempting to quantify their methodology.

Cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker harshly criticized the Doomsday Clock as a political stunt, pointing to the words of its founder that its purpose was &quot;to preserve civilization by scaring men into rationality&quot;. He stated that it is inconsistent and not based on any objective indicators of security, using as an example its being farther from midnight in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis than in the &quot;far calmer 2007&quot;. He argued it was another example of humanity&#x27;s tendency toward historical pessimism, and compared it to other predictions of self-destruction that went unfulfilled.

Conservative media outlets have often criticized the &quot;Bulletin&quot; and the Doomsday Clock. Keith Payne wrote 2010 in the &quot;National Review&quot; that the Clock overestimated the effects of &quot;developments in the areas of nuclear testing and formal arms control&quot;. In 2018, Tristin Hopper in the &quot;National Post&quot; acknowledged that &quot;there are plenty of things to worry about regarding climate change&quot;, but states that climate change is not in the same league as total nuclear destruction. In addition, some critics accuse the &quot;Bulletin&quot; of pushing a political agenda.

== In popular culture ==

* &quot;Seven Minutes to Midnight&quot;, a 1980 single by Wah! Heat, refers to that year&#x27;s change of the Doomsday Clock from nine to seven minutes to midnight.
* Australian rock band Midnight Oil&#x27;s 1984 LP &quot;Red Sails in the Sunset&quot; features a song called &quot;Minutes to Midnight&quot;, and the album&#x27;s cover shows an aerial-view rendering of Sydney after a nuclear strike.
* The title of Iron Maiden&#x27;s 1984 song &quot;2 Minutes to Midnight&quot; is a reference to the Doomsday Clock.
* The Doomsday Clock appears in the beginning of the 1985 music video for &quot;Russians&quot; by Sting.
* The 1986 short story &quot;The End of the Whole Mess&quot; by Stephen King refers to the Doomsday Clock being set at fifteen seconds before midnight due to elevated geopolitical tension.
* The Doomsday Clock was a recurring visual theme in Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons&#x27;s seminal &quot;Watchmen&quot; graphic novel series (1986–87), its 2009 film adaptation, and its 2019 television miniseries sequel. Additionally its sequel series, which takes place in the main DC Universe, borrows the title.
* The title of Linkin Park&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Minutes to Midnight&quot; is a reference to the Doomsday Clock. Their music video for &quot;Shadow of the Day&quot; from Minutes to Midnight, represents the Doomsday Clock as an actual clock with it reaching midnight at the end of the video.
* In the Flobots&#x27; song &quot;The Circle in the Square&quot;, the lyrics say &quot;the clock is now 11:55 on the big hand&quot;, which was the Doomsday Clock&#x27;s setting in 2012 when the song was released.
* The title of the 1982 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Four to Doomsday&quot; references the Doomsday Clock. In the 2017 episode &quot;The Pyramid at the End of the World&quot;, the Monks changed every clock in the world to three minutes to midnight as a warning about what will happen if humanity does not accept their help. Representatives of the three most powerful armies on Earth agreed not to fight each other, believing a potential war is the catastrophe. However, the clock remained displaying two minutes to midnight. After the Doctor averted the true catastrophe – an accidental bacteriological disaster –, the clock began moving backwards. 
* The Doomsday Clock is featured in Yael Bartana&#x27;s &quot;What if Women Ruled the World&quot;, which premiered on July5, 2017 at the Manchester International Festival.
* One minute to midnight on the Doomsday Clock is heavily referenced in the grime/punk crossover song &quot;Effed&quot; by Nottingham rapper Snowy and Jason Williamson of Sleaford Mods. Because of the track&#x27;s political content, there was an initial reluctance from mainstream radio stations to play the track before the 2019 United Kingdom general election. However, the track was later championed by a number of BBC Radio DJs, including punk innovator Iggy Pop.
* In the &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; season 13 episode &quot;The Bunker&quot;, the unsubs abduct women using the Doomsday Clock.
* The &quot;Madam Secretary&quot; season 2 episode &quot;On the Clock&quot; features the Doomsday Clock, as the characters try to keep it from moving forward.
* The character Bezel in &quot;Chikn Nuggit&quot; is a personification of the Doomsday Clock.

<text>Hexactinellid sponges are sponges with a skeleton made of four- and/or six-pointed siliceous spicules, often referred to as glass sponges. They are usually classified along with other sponges in the phylum Porifera, but some researchers consider them sufficiently distinct to deserve their own phylum, Symplasma. Some experts believe glass sponges are the longest-lived animals on earth; these scientists tentatively estimate a maximum age of up to 15,000 years.

== Biology ==
Glass sponges are relatively uncommon and are mostly found at depths from below sea level. Although the species &quot;Oopsacas minuta&quot; has been found in shallow water, others have been found much deeper. They are found in all oceans of the world, although they are particularly common in Antarctic and Northern Pacific waters.

They are more-or-less cup-shaped animals, ranging from in height, with sturdy skeletons made of glass-like silica spicules, fused to form a lattice. In some glass sponges such as members of the genus &quot;Euplectela&quot;, these structures are aided by a protein called glassin. It helps accelerate the production of silicas from the silicic acid absorbed from the surrounding seawater. The body is relatively symmetrical, with a large central cavity that, in many species, opens to the outside through a sieve formed from the skeleton. Some species of glass sponges are capable of fusing together to create reefs or bioherms. They are generally pale in colour, ranging from white to orange.

Much of the body is composed of syncitial tissue, extensive regions of multinucleate cytoplasm. The epidermal cells characteristic of other sponges are absent, being replaced by a syncitial net of amoebocytes, through which the spicules penetrate. Unlike other sponges, they do not possess the ability to contract.

Their body comprises three parts: the inner and outer peripheral trabecular networks, and the choanosome, which is used for feeding purposes. The choanosome acts as the mouth for the sponge while the inner and outer canals that meet at the choanosome are passages for the food, creating a consumption path for the sponge.

All hexactinellids have the potential to grow to different sizes, but the average maximum growth is estimated to be around 32 centimeters long. Some grow past that length and continue to extend their length up to 1 meter long. The estimated life expectancy for hexactinellids that grow around 1 meter is approximately 200 years (Plyes).

Glass sponges possess a unique system for rapidly conducting electrical impulses across their bodies, making it possible for them to respond quickly to external stimuli. In the case &quot;Rhabdocalyptus dawsoni,&quot; the sponge uses electrical neuron signaling to detect outside stimuli, such as sediments, and then send a signal through its body system to alert the organism to no longer be actively feeding. Another glass sponge species in the same experiment of &quot;R. dawsoni,&quot; showed that the electrical conduction system for this class of sponges all has its own threshold of how much outside stimuli, sediments, etc., it can endure before it will stop its feeding process. Species like &quot;Venus&#x27; flower basket&quot; have a tuft of fibers that extends outward like an inverted crown at the base of their skeleton. These fibers are long and about the thickness of a human hair.

=== Syncytia ===
Bodies of glass sponges are different from those other sponges in various other ways. For example, most of their cytoplasm is not divided into separate cells by membranes, but forms a syncytium or continuous mass of cytoplasm with many nuclei (e.g., Reiswig and Mackie, 1983); it is held suspended like a cobweb by a scaffolding-like framework made of silica spicules. The remaining cells are connected to the syncytium by bridges of cytoplasmic &quot;rivers&quot; that transport nuclei, organelles (&quot;organs&quot; within cells) and other substances. Instead of choanocytes, these bridges have further syncytia, known as choanosyncytia, which form bell-shaped chambers where water enters via perforations. The insides of these chambers are lined with &quot;collar bodies&quot;, each consisting of a collar and flagellum but without a nucleus of its own. The motion of the flagella sucks water through passages in the &quot;cobweb&quot; and expels it via the open ends of the bell-shaped chambers.

Some types of cells have a single nucleus and membrane each but are connected to other single-nucleus cells and to the main syncytium by &quot;bridges&quot; made of cytoplasm. The sclerocytes that build spicules have multiple nuclei, and in glass sponge larvae they are connected to other tissues by cytoplasm bridges; such connections between sclerocytes have not so far been found in adults, but this may simply reflect the difficulty of investigating such small-scale features. The bridges are controlled by &quot;plugged junctions&quot; that apparently permit some substances to pass while blocking others.

This physiology is what allows for a greater flow of ions and electrical signals to move throughout the organism, with around 75% of the sponge tissue being fused in this way. Another way is their role in the nutrient cycles of deep-sea environments. One species for example, &quot;Vazella pourtalesii&quot;, has an abundance of symbiotic microbes which aid in the nitrification and denitrification of the communities in which they are present. These interactions help the sponges survive in the low-oxygen conditions of the depths.

=== Longevity ===
These creatures are long-lived, but the exact age is hard to measure; one study based on modelling gave an estimated age of a specimen of &quot;Scolymastra joubini&quot; as 23,000 years (with a range from 13,000 to 40,000 years). However, due to changes in sea levels since the Last Glacial Maximum, its maximum age is thought to be no more than 15,000 years, hence its listing of c. 15,000 years in the AnAge Database. The shallow-water occurrence of hexactinellids is rare worldwide. In the Antarctic, two species occur as shallow as 33 meters under the ice. In the Mediterranean, one species occurs as shallow as in a cave with deep water upwelling (Boury-Esnault &amp; Vacelet (1994))

==Reefs==
The sponges form reefs (called sponge reefs) off the coast of British Columbia, southeast Alaska and Washington state, which are studied in the Sponge Reef Project. In the case of &quot;Sarostegia oculata,&quot; this species almost always hosts symbiotic zoanthids, which cause the hexactinellid sponge to imitate the appearance and structure of coral reefs. Only 33 species of this sponge have ever been reported in the South Atlantic until 2017 when the Shinkai 6500 submersible went on an expedition through the Rio Grande Rise. Reefs discovered in Hecate Strait, British Columbia, have grown to up to 7 kilometres long and 20 metres high. Prior to these discoveries, sponge reefs were thought to have died out in the Jurassic period.

Reports of glass sponges have also been recorded on the HMCS &quot;Saskatchewan&quot; and HMCS &quot;Cape Breton&quot; wrecks off the coast of Vancouver Island. Species of zoantharin that rely on hexactinellid have also been found off the coast of the Japanese island of Minami-Torishima. Unidentified species of zoanthids have also been found in Australian waters, if these are identified as the same as the ones found in Minami-Torishima, this could potentially be proof of hexactinellids existing in all of the Pacific Ocean.

== Conservation ==
Most hexactinellids live in deep waters that are not impacted by human activities. However, there are glass sponge reefs off the coast of British Columbia. The Canadian government designated 2140 km2 of the Hecate strait and Queen Charlotte sound as a marine protected area. This area contains four glass sponge reefs. The new regulations prohibit bottom contact fishing within 200 meters of the sponge reefs. Although human activities only affect a small portion of glass sponges, they are still subject to the threat of climate changes. Experiments using the species &quot;Aphrocallistes vastus&quot; have shown that increases in temperature and acidification can lead to weakened skeletal strength and stiffness. In 1995, an Antarctic ice shelf collapsed due to climate change. Since then, studies of the area have shown that hexactinellid reefs have been increasing in size despite the changes in climate.

==Evolution and taxonomy==
The earliest known hexactinellids are from the earliest Cambrian or late Neoproterozoic eras; &quot;Helicolocellus&quot; is a possible hexactinellid relative from the late Ediacaran. They are fairly common relative to demosponges as fossils, but this is thought to be, at least in part, because their spicules are sturdier than spongin and fossilize better. Like almost all sponges, the hexactinellids draw water in through a series of small pores by the whip-like beating of a series of hairs or flagella in chambers which in this group line the sponge wall.

The class is divided into two subclasses and several orders:

Class Hexactinellida
*Subclass Amphidiscophora
**Order Amphidiscosida
**Order †Hemidiscosa
**Order †Reticulosa
*Subclass Hexasterophora
**&quot;Incertae sedis&quot;
***Dactylocalycidae 
**Order Lychniscosida
**Order Lyssacinosida
**Order Sceptrulophora

<doc id="47615" wikidata="Q137" url="?curid=47615" title="Rook (chess)">
<text>The rook (; ♖, ♜) is a piece in the game of chess. It may move any number of squares horizontally or vertically without jumping, and it may an enemy piece on its path; it may participate in castling. Each player starts the game with two rooks, one in each corner on their side of the board.

Formerly, the rook (from ) was alternatively called the &quot;tower&quot;, &quot;marquess&quot;, &quot;rector&quot;, and &quot;comes&quot; (&quot;count&quot; or &quot;earl&quot;). The term &quot;castle&quot; is considered to be informal or old-fashioned.

==Placement and movement==



The white rooks start on the squares a1 and h1, while the black rooks start on a8 and h8. The rook moves horizontally or vertically, through any number of unoccupied squares. The rook cannot jump over pieces. The rook may capture an enemy piece by moving to the square on which the enemy piece stands, removing it from play. The rook also participates with the king in a special move called castling, wherein it is transferred to the square crossed by the king after the king is shifted two squares toward the rook.
==Strategy==

===Relative value===
The rook is worth about five pawns. In general, rooks are stronger than bishops or knights and are considered greater in value than either of those pieces by nearly two pawns, but less valuable than two minor pieces by approximately a pawn. Two rooks are generally considered to be worth slightly more than a queen (see chess piece relative value). Winning a rook for a bishop or knight is referred to as winning &quot;the exchange&quot;. Rooks and queens are called &quot;major pieces&quot; or &quot;heavy pieces&quot;, as opposed to bishops and knights, the &quot;minor pieces&quot;.

===Development===
In the opening, the rooks are blocked in by other pieces and cannot immediately participate in the game, so it is usually desirable to &quot;connect&quot; one&#x27;s rooks on the by castling and then clearing all pieces except the king and rooks from the first rank. In that position, the rooks support each other and can more easily move to occupy and control the most favorable .

A common strategic goal is to a rook on the first rank of an open file (i.e., one unobstructed by pawns of either player) or a half-open file (i.e., one unobstructed by friendly pawns). From this position, the rook is relatively unexposed to risk but can exert control on every square on the file. If one file is particularly important, a player might advance one rook on it, then position the other rook behind—&quot;doubling&quot; the rooks.

A rook on the seventh rank (the opponent&#x27;s second rank) is typically very powerful, as it threatens the opponent&#x27;s unadvanced pawns and hems in the enemy king. A rook on the seventh rank is often considered sufficient compensation for a pawn. In the diagrammed position from a game between Lev Polugaevsky and Larry Evans, the rook on the seventh rank enables White to draw, despite being a pawn down.

 rooks on the seventh rank are often enough to force victory by the blind swine mate, or at least a draw by perpetual check.


===Endgame===
Rooks are most powerful towards the end of a game (i.e., the endgame), when they can move unobstructed by pawns and control large numbers of squares. They have trouble restraining enemy pawns from advancing towards promotion unless they occupy the file behind them. As well, a rook best supports a friendly pawn towards promotion from behind it on the same file (see Tarrasch rule).

In a position with a rook and one or two versus two rooks, generally in addition to pawns, and possibly other pieces, Lev Alburt advises that the player with the single rook should avoid exchanging the rook for one of his opponent&#x27;s rooks.

The rook is adept at delivering checkmate. Below are a few examples of rook checkmates that are easy to . A single rook can force checkmate while a single minor piece cannot.




==History==
In the medieval shatranj, the rook symbolized a chariot. The Persian word means &quot;chariot&quot;, as does the name of the corresponding piece in the original Indian version, chaturanga, . In modern times, it is mostly known as (elephant) to Hindi-speaking players, while East Asian chess games such as xiangqi and shogi have names also meaning chariot () for the same piece.


Persian war chariots were heavily armored, carrying a driver and at least one ranged-weapon bearer, such as an archer. The sides of the chariot were built to resemble fortified stone work, giving the impression of small, mobile buildings, causing terror on the battlefield.

In Europe, the castle or tower appears for the first time in the 16th century in Vida&#x27;s 1550 , and then as a tower on the back of an elephant. In time, the elephant disappeared and only the tower was used as the piece.

In the West, the rook is almost universally represented as a crenellated turret. The piece is called (&quot;tower&quot;) in Italian, Portuguese, Catalan and Spanish; in French; in Dutch; in German; in Swedish; and in Finnish. In Hungarian, it is (&quot;bastion&quot;) and in Hebrew, it is called (, meaning &quot;turret&quot;). In the British Museum&#x27;s collection of the medieval Lewis chess pieces, the rooks appear as stern warders, or wild-eyed berserker warriors.

Rooks are usually similar in appearance to small castles; thus, a rook is sometimes called a &quot;castle&quot;, though modern chess literature rarely, if ever, uses this term.

In some languages, the rook is called a ship: Thai (), Armenian (), Russian (), Javanese (). This may be because of the use of an Arabic style V-shaped rook piece, which some may have mistaken for a ship. It is possible that the rendition comes from Sanskrit (ship); however, no chaturanga pieces were ever called a . Murray argued that the Javanese could not visualize a chariot moving through the jungles in sweeping fashion as the rook. The only vehicle that moved in straight fashion was a ship, thus they replaced it with . Murray, however, did not give an explanation why the Russians call the piece a &quot;ship&quot;.

Peter Tyson suggests that there is a correlation between the name of the piece and the word , a mythical giant bird of prey from Persian mythology.

In South Slavic languages, it is called the &quot;cannon&quot; ().

In Kannada, it is known as (), meaning &quot;elephant&quot;. This is unusual, as the term for elephant is in many other languages applied to the bishop.

==Heraldry==
 Chess rooks frequently occur as heraldic charges. Heraldic rooks are usually shown as they looked in medieval chess sets, with the usual battlements replaced by two outward-curving horns. They occur in arms from around the 13th century onwards.

In Canadian heraldry, the chess rook is the cadency mark of a fifth daughter.

<doc id="47616" wikidata="Q134" url="?curid=47616" title="Bishop (chess)">
<text>The bishop (♗, ♝) is a piece in the game of chess. It moves and captures along without jumping over interfering pieces. Each player begins the game with two bishops. The starting squares are c1 and f1 for White&#x27;s bishops, and c8 and f8 for Black&#x27;s bishops.
==Placement and movement==
The is placed on f1 for White and f8 for Black; the is placed on c1 for White and c8 for Black.

The bishop has no restrictions in distance for each move but is limited to diagonal movement. It cannot jump over other pieces. A bishop captures by occupying the square on which an enemy piece stands. As a consequence of its diagonal movement, each bishop always remains on one square color. Due to this, it is common to refer to a bishop as a &quot;light-squared&quot; or &quot;dark-squared&quot; bishop. 



==Comparison – other pieces==

===Versus rook===

A rook is generally worth about two pawns more than a bishop. The bishop has access to only half of the squares on the board, whereas all squares of the board are accessible to the rook. When unobstructed, a rook attacks fourteen squares regardless of position, whereas a bishop attacks no more than thirteen (from one of four center squares) and sometimes as few as seven (from sides and corners). A king and rook can checkmate against a lone king, whereas a king and bishop cannot. A king and two bishops on opposite-colored squares, however, can force mate.

===Versus knight===
Knights and bishops are each worth about three pawns. This means bishops are approximately equal in strength to knights, but depending on the game situation, either may have a distinct advantage. In general, the bishop is slightly stronger than the knight.

Less experienced players tend to underrate the bishop compared to the knight because the knight can reach all squares and is more adept at forking. More experienced players understand the power of the bishop.

Bishops usually gain in relative strength towards the endgame as more pieces are captured and more open lines become available on which they can operate. A bishop can easily influence both wings simultaneously, whereas a knight is less capable of doing so. In an open endgame, a pair of bishops is decidedly superior to either a bishop and a knight, or two knights. A player possessing a pair of bishops has a strategic weapon in the form of a long-term threat to trade down to an advantageous endgame.

Two bishops on opposite-colored squares and king can force checkmate against a lone king, whereas two knights cannot. A bishop and knight can force mate, but with far greater difficulty than two bishops.

In certain positions a bishop can by itself lose a move (see triangulation and tempo), while a knight can never do so. The bishop is capable of skewering or pinning a piece, while the knight can do neither. A bishop can in some situations hinder a knight from moving. In these situations, the bishop is said to be &quot;dominating&quot; the knight.

On the other hand, in the opening and middlegame a bishop may be hemmed in by pawns of both players, and thus be inferior to a knight which can jump over them. A knight check cannot be blocked but a bishop check can. Furthermore, on a crowded board a knight has many tactical opportunities to fork two enemy pieces. A bishop can fork, but opportunities are rarer. One such example occurs in the position illustrated, which arises from the Ruy Lopez: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 b5 6.Bb3 Be7 7.d4 d6 8.c3 Bg4 9.h3 Bxf3 10.Qxf3 exd4 11.Qg3 g6 12.Bh6



==Game use==

===Good bishop and bad bishop===

In the middlegame, a player with only one bishop should generally place friendly pawns on squares of the color that the bishop cannot move to. This allows the player to control squares of both colors, allows the bishop to move freely among the pawns, and helps fix enemy pawns on squares on which they can be attacked by the bishop. Such a bishop is often referred to as a &quot;good&quot; bishop.

Conversely, a bishop which is impeded by friendly pawns is often referred to as a &quot;bad bishop&quot; (or sometimes, disparagingly, a &quot;tall pawn&quot;). The black light-squared bishop in the French Defense is a notorious example of this concept. A &quot;bad&quot; bishop, however, need not always be a weakness, especially if it is outside its own . In addition, having a &quot;bad&quot; bishop may be advantageous in an opposite-colored bishops endgame. Even if the bad bishop is passively placed, it may serve a useful defensive function; a well-known quip from GM Mihai Suba is that &quot;Bad bishops protect good pawns.&quot;

In the position from the game Krasenkow versus Zvjaginsev, a thicket of black pawns hems in Black&#x27;s bishop on c8, so Black is effectively playing with one piece fewer than White. Although the black pawns also obstruct the white bishop on e2, it has many more attacking possibilities, and thus is a good bishop vis-à-vis Black&#x27;s bad bishop. Black resigned after another ten moves.

===Fianchetto===

A bishop may be &quot;fianchettoed&quot;, for example after moving the g2 pawn to g3 and the bishop on f1 to g2. This can form a strong defense for the castled king on g1 and the bishop can often exert strong pressure on the long diagonal (here h1–a8). A fianchettoed bishop should generally not be given up lightly, since the resulting in the pawn formation may prove to be serious weaknesses, particularly if the king has castled on that side of the board.

There are nonetheless some modern opening lines where a fianchettoed bishop is given up for a knight in order to double the opponent&#x27;s pawns, for example 1.d4 g6 2.c4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c5 4.d5 Bxc3+!? 5.bxc3 f5, a sharp line originated by Roman Dzindzichashvili. Giving up a fianchettoed queen&#x27;s bishop for a knight is usually less problematic. For example, in Karpov–Browne, San Antonio 1972, after 1.c4 c5 2.b3 Nf6 3.Bb2 g6, Karpov gave up his fianchettoed bishop with 4.Bxf6! exf6 5.Nc3, doubling Black&#x27;s pawns and giving him a hole on d5.

===Endgame===
An endgame in which each player has only one bishop, one controlling the dark squares and the other the light, will often result in a draw even if one player has a pawn or sometimes two more than the other. The players tend to gain control of squares of opposite colors, and a deadlock results. In endgames with same-colored bishops, however, even a positional advantage may be enough to win.
====Bishops on opposite colors====
Endgames in which each player has only one bishop (and no other pieces besides the king) and the bishops are on opposite colors are often drawn, even when one side has an extra pawn or two. Many of these positions would be a win if the bishops were on the same color.



The position from Wolf versus Leonhardt (see diagram) shows an important defensive setup. Black can make no progress, since the white bishop ties the black king to defending the pawn on g4 and it also prevents the advance ...f3+ because it would simply the pawn – then either the other pawn is exchanged for the bishop (an immediate draw) or the pawn advances (an easily drawn position). Otherwise the bishop alternates between the squares d1 and e2.

If two pawns are connected, they normally win if they reach their sixth , otherwise the game may be a draw (as above). If two pawns are separated by one they usually draw, but win if they are farther apart.

In some cases with more pawns on the board, it is actually advantageous to have the bishops on opposite colors if one side has weak pawns. In the 1925 game Efim Bogoljubov–Max Blümich (see diagram), White wins because of the bishops being on opposite colors making Black weak on the dark squares, the weakness of Black&#x27;s isolated pawns on the , and the weak doubled pawns on the . The game continued:

:29.Kd2 Ke7 30.Kc3 f6 31.Kd4 Be6 32.Kc5 Kd7 33.Kb6 g5 34.Kxa6 Kc7 35.Bb6+ Kc8 36.Bc5 Kc7 37.Bf8 f5 38.Bxg7 f4 39.Bf6 f3 40.gxf3 exf3 41.Bxg5 Bxh3 42.Bf4+ 

====Wrong bishop====

In an endgame with a bishop, in some cases the bishop is the &quot;wrong bishop&quot;, meaning that it is on the wrong color of square for some purpose (usually promoting a pawn). For example, with just a bishop and a , if the bishop cannot control the promotion square of the pawn, it is said to be the &quot;wrong bishop&quot; or the pawn is said to be the wrong rook pawn. This results in some positions being drawn (by setting up a fortress) which otherwise would be won.

==History==



The bishop&#x27;s predecessor in medieval chess, shatranj (originally chaturanga), was the alfil, meaning &quot;elephant&quot;, which could leap two squares along any diagonal, and could jump over an intervening piece. As a consequence, each fil was restricted to eight squares, and no fil could attack another. The modern bishop first appeared shortly after 1200 in Courier chess. A piece with this move, called a or crocodile, is part of the Grande Acedrex in the compiled in 1283 for King Alfonso X of Castile. The game is attributed to &quot;India&quot;, then a very vague term. About half a century later Muḥammad ibn Maḥmud al-Āmulī, in his &quot;Treasury of the Sciences&quot;, describes an expanded form of chess with two pieces moving &quot;like the rook but obliquely&quot;. The bishop was also independently invented in Japan at about the same time (the 13th century), where it formed part of sho shogi and dai shogi; it remains present in modern shogi as the direct descendant of sho shogi.

Derivatives of &quot;alfil&quot; survive in the languages of the two countries where chess was first introduced within Western Europe—Italian () and Spanish (). It was known as the in French, or the aufin, alphin, or archer in early English.

The earliest references to bishops on the chessboard are two 13th-century Latin texts, and . The etymology of &quot;bishop&quot; comes from Old English bisceop &quot;bishop, high priest,&quot; from Late Latin episcopus, from Greek episkopos &quot;watcher, overseer.&quot; The term &quot;bishop&quot; as applied specifically to the chess piece was first recorded in the 16th century, with the first known written example dating back to the 1560s. In all other Germanic languages, except for Icelandic, it is called various names, all of which directly translate to English as &quot;runner&quot; or &quot;messenger&quot;. In Icelandic, however, it is called &quot;, with the same meaning as in English. The use of the term in Icelandic predates that of the English language, as the first mentioning of &quot; in Icelandic texts dates back to the early part of the 14th century, while the 12th-century Lewis Chessmen portray the bishop as an unambiguously ecclesiastical figure. In the &quot;Saga of Earl Mágus&quot;, which was written in Iceland somewhere between 1300–1325, it is described how an emperor was checkmated by a bishop. This has led to some speculations as to the origin of the English use of the term &quot;bishop&quot;.

The canonical chessmen date back to the Staunton chess set of 1849. The piece&#x27;s deep groove symbolizes a bishop&#x27;s (or abbot&#x27;s) mitre. Some have written that the groove originated from the original form of the piece, an elephant with the groove representing the elephant&#x27;s tusks. The English apparently chose to call the piece a bishop because the projections at the top resembled a mitre. This groove was interpreted differently in different countries as the game moved to Europe; in France, for example, the groove was taken to be a jester&#x27;s cap, hence in France the bishop is called (jester) and in Romania (meaning crazy, but also jester).

In some Slavic languages (e.g. Czech/Slovak) the bishop is called &quot;střelec/strelec&quot;, which directly translates to English as a &quot;shooter&quot; meaning an archer, while in others it is still known as &quot;elephant&quot; (e.g. Russian ). In South Slavic languages it is usually known as &quot;lovac&quot;, meaning &quot;hunter&quot;, or &quot;laufer&quot;, taken from the German name for the same piece (&quot;laufer&quot; is also a co-official Polish name for the piece alongside &quot;goniec&quot;). In Bulgarian the bishop is called &quot;officer&quot; (), which is also the piece&#x27;s alternative name in Russian; it is also called () in Greek, () in Belarusian and &quot;oficeri&quot; in Albanian.

In Mongolian and several Indian languages it is called the &quot;camel&quot;.

In Lithuanian it is the &quot;, a kind of military commander in medieval Lithuania.

In Latvia it is known as &quot;, a term for the wooden handle part of some firearms.

<text>A chess piece, or chessman, is a game piece that is placed on a chessboard to play the game of chess. It can be either white or black, and it can be one of six types: king, queen, rook, bishop, knight, or pawn.

Chess sets generally come with sixteen pieces of each color. Additional pieces, usually an extra queen per color, may be provided for use in promotion or handicap games.

==Number==

Each player begins with sixteen pieces (but see the subsection below for other usage of the term &quot;piece&quot;). The pieces that belong to each player are distinguished by color: the lighter colored pieces are referred to as &quot;white&quot; and the player that controls them as &quot;White&quot;, whereas the darker colored pieces are referred to as &quot;black&quot; and the player that controls them as &quot;Black&quot;.

In a standard game, each of the two players begins with the following sixteen pieces:
* 1 king
* 1 queen
* 2 rooks
* 2 bishops
* 2 knights
* 8 pawns

== Definitions ==
The word &quot;piece&quot; has three meanings, depending on the context.
# It may mean any of the physical pieces of the set, including the pawns. When used this way, &quot;piece&quot; is synonymous with &quot;chessman&quot; or simply &quot;man&quot;. Chess sets have been made in a variety of styles, sometimes for decorative or artistic purposes rather than practical play, but the Staunton pattern is standard for competition.
# In play, the term is usually used to exclude pawns, referring only to a queen, rook, bishop, knight, or king. In this context, the pieces can be broken down into three groups: &quot;major pieces&quot; (queen and rooks), &quot;minor pieces&quot; (bishops and knights), and the king.
# In phrases such as &quot;winning a piece&quot;, &quot;losing a piece&quot; or &quot;sacrificing a piece&quot; and other related contexts, it refers only to minor pieces (bishops or knights). By convention, the queen, rooks, and pawns are specified by name in these cases – for example, &quot;winning a queen&quot;, &quot;losing a rook&quot;, or &quot;sacrificing a pawn&quot;.

==Moves==

The rules of chess prescribe the moves each type of chess piece can make. During play, the players take turns moving their own chess pieces.
* The rook may move any number of squares vertically or horizontally without jumping. It also takes part, along with the king, in castling.
* The bishop may move any number of squares diagonally without jumping. Consequently, a bishop stays on squares of the same color throughout the game.
* The queen may move any number of squares vertically, horizontally, or diagonally without jumping.
* The king may move to any adjoining square. No move may be made such that the king is placed or left in check. The king may participate in castling, which is a move consisting of the king moving two squares toward a same-colored rook on the same rank and the rook moving to the square crossed by the king. Castling may only be performed if the king and rook involved are unmoved, if the king is not in check, if the king would not travel through or into check, and if there are no pieces between the rook and the king.
* The knight moves from one corner of any two-by-three rectangle to the opposite corner. (This can be thought of as moving two squares horizontally then one square vertically, or moving one square horizontally then two squares vertically—i.e. in an &quot;L&quot; pattern.) Consequently, the knight alternates its square color each time it moves. It is not obstructed by other pieces.
* The pawn may move forward one square, and one or two squares when on its starting square, toward the opponent&#x27;s side of the board. When there is an enemy piece one square diagonally ahead of a pawn, then the pawn may capture that piece. A pawn can perform a special type of capture of an enemy pawn called &quot;en passant&quot; (&quot;in passing&quot;), wherein it captures a horizontally adjacent enemy pawn that has just advanced two squares as if that pawn had only advanced one square. If the pawn reaches a square on the of the opponent, it promotes to the player&#x27;s choice of a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color.

Pieces other than pawns capture in the same way that they move. A capturing piece replaces the opponent piece on its square, except for an &quot;en passant&quot; capture by a pawn. Captured pieces are immediately removed from the game. A square may hold only one piece at any given time. Except for castling and the knight&#x27;s move, no piece may jump over another piece.

==Relative value==

The value assigned to a piece attempts to represent the potential strength of the piece in the game. As the game develops, the relative values of the pieces will also change. For example, in an , bishops are relatively more valuable; they can be positioned to control long, open diagonal spaces. In a with lines of protected pawns blocking bishops, knights usually become relatively more potent. Similar ideas apply to placing rooks on open files and knights on active, . The standard valuation is one point for a pawn, three points for a knight or bishop, five points for a rook, and nine points for a queen. These values are reliable in endgames, particularly with a limited number of pieces. But these values can change depending on the position or the phase of the game (opening, middle game, or ending). A for example, is worth an additional half-pawn on average. In specific circumstances, the values may be quite different: sometimes a knight can be more valuable than a queen if a particular angle is required for a mating attack, such as certain smothered mates. The humble pawn becomes more and more valuable the closer it is to securing a queen promotion for another example.

==History==

Chess evolved over time from its earliest versions in India and Persia to variants that spread both West and East. Pieces changed names and rules as well; the most notable changes was the Vizir (or Firz) becoming the Queen, and the Elephant becoming the Bishop in European versions of chess. The movement patterns for Queens and Bishops also changed, with the earliest rules restricting elephants to just two squares along a diagonal, but allowing them to &quot;jump&quot; (seen in the fairy chess piece the alfil); and the earliest versions of queens could only move a single square diagonally (the fairy chess piece Ferz). The modern bishop&#x27;s movement was popularized in the 14th and 15th centuries, and the modern queen was popularized in the 15th and 16th centuries, with versions with the more powerful modern queen eclipsing older variants.


==Names==

The characters implied by pieces&#x27; names vary between languages. For example, in many languages, the piece known in English as the &quot;knight&quot; frequently translates as &quot;horse&quot;, and the English &quot;bishop&quot; frequently translates as &quot;elephant&quot; in language areas that adapted the modern bishop&#x27;s movement pattern, but not its new name.

==Variants==
Chess variants sometimes include new, non-standard, or even old pieces. For example, Courier Chess, a predecessor of modern chess dating from the 12th century, was played on an 8×12 board and used all six modern chess piece types, plus three additional types of pieces: Courier, Mann (or &quot;rath&quot; or &quot;sage&quot;), and Jester. Variants of &quot;old&quot; chess might use the old rules for bishops/elephants with the alfil piece, or old rules for Queens with the ferz. Many modern variants with unorthodox pieces exist, such as Berolina chess which uses custom pawns that advance diagonally and capture vertically.

<doc id="47619" wikidata="Q136" url="?curid=47619" title="Knight (chess)">
<text>The knight (♘, ♞) is a piece in the game of chess, represented by a horse&#x27;s head and neck. It moves two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically, jumping over other pieces. Each player starts the game with two knights on the b- and g-, each located between a rook and a bishop.
==Movement==
Compared to other chess pieces, the knight&#x27;s movement is unique: it moves two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically (with both forming the shape of a capital L). Consequently, a knight alternates between light and dark squares with each move. When moving, the knight can jump over pieces to reach its destination. Knights capture in the same way, replacing the enemy piece on the square and removing it from the board. A knight can have up to eight available moves at once. Knights and pawns are the only pieces that can be moved in the chess starting position.



==Value==

Knights and bishops, also known as , have a value of about three pawns. Bishops utilize a longer range, but they can move only to squares of one color. The knight&#x27;s value increases in since it can jump over blockades. Knights and bishops are stronger when supported by other pieces (such as pawns) to create outposts and become more powerful when they advance, as long as they remain . Generally, knights are strongest in the of the board, where they have up to eight moves, and weakest in a corner, where they have only two.


==Properties==

Enemy pawns are effective at harassing knights because a pawn attacking a knight is not itself attacked by the knight and, because a pawn is worth less than a knight, it does not matter if the knight is defended. For this reason, a knight is effective when placed in a weakness in the opponent&#x27;s pawn structure, i.e. a square which cannot be attacked by enemy pawns. In the diagram, White&#x27;s knight on d5 is very powerful – more powerful than Black&#x27;s bishop on g7.

Whereas two bishops cover each other&#x27;s weaknesses, two knights tend not to cooperate with each other as efficiently. As such, a pair of bishops is usually considered better than a pair of knights. World Champion José Raúl Capablanca considered that a queen and a knight is usually a better combination than a queen and a bishop. However, Glenn Flear found no game of Capablanca&#x27;s that supported his statement; statistics do not support the statement, either. In an endgame without other pieces or pawns, two knights generally have a better chance of forming a drawing fortress against a queen than do two bishops or a bishop and a knight.

Compared to a bishop, a knight is often not as good in an endgame. A knight can exert control over only one part of the board at a time and often takes multiple moves to reposition to a new location, which often makes it less suitable in endgames with pawns on both sides of the board. This limitation is less important, however, in endgames with pawns on only one side of the board. Knights are superior to bishops in an endgame if all the pawns are on one side of the board. Furthermore, knights have the advantage of being able to control squares of either color, unlike a lone bishop. Nonetheless, a disadvantage of the knight (compared to the other pieces) is that by itself it cannot lose a move to put the opponent in zugzwang (see triangulation and tempo), while a bishop can. In the position pictured on the right, if the knight is on a white square and it is White&#x27;s turn to move, White cannot win. Similarly, if the knight were on a black square and it were Black&#x27;s turn to move, White cannot win. In the other two cases, White would win. If instead of the knight, White had a bishop on either color of square, White would win with either side to move.

In an endgame where one side has only a king and a knight while the other side has only a king, the game is a draw since a checkmate is impossible. When a lone king faces a king and two knights, a checkmate can never be ; checkmate can occur only if the opponent commits a blunder by moving their king to a square where it can be checkmated on the next move. Checkmate can be forced with a bishop and knight, however, or with two bishops, even though the bishop and knight are in general about equal in value. Paradoxically, checkmate with two knights sometimes be forced if the weaker side has a single extra pawn, but this is a curiosity of little practical value (see two knights endgame). Pawnless endgames are a rarity, and if the stronger side has even a single pawn, an extra knight should give them an easy win. A bishop can trap (although it cannot then capture) a knight on the rim (see diagram), especially in the endgame.

===Stamma&#x27;s mate===
In a few rare endgame positions where the opposing king is trapped in a corner in front of its own pawn, it is possible to force mate with only a king and knight in a pattern known as Stamma&#x27;s mate, which has occasionally been seen in practice. In the position below, from Nogueiras–Gongora, Cuban championship 2001, Black played 75...Nxf6, incorrectly assuming that the ending would be drawn following the capture of the last white pawn on a2. (Correct was 75...Ne3 76.Kg6 Ng4 77.Kg7 and now 77...Nxf6! may be safely played, the king being sufficiently distant).

==Notation==
In algebraic notation, the usual modern way of recording chess games, the letter &quot;N&quot; stands for the knight (&quot;K&quot; is reserved for the king); in descriptive chess notation, &quot;Kt&quot; is sometimes used instead, mainly in older literature. In chess problems and endgame studies, the letter &quot;S&quot;, standing for &quot;Springer&quot;, the German name for the piece, is often used (and in some variants of fairy chess, &quot;N&quot; is used for the nightrider, a popular fairy chess piece).

==History==
The knight has the oldest defined movement of any chess piece. It was first introduced in the Indian game of chaturanga around the 6th century; it has not changed since.

===Variants===
Pieces similar to the knight are found in almost all games of the chess family. The &quot;ma&quot; of xiangqi and janggi is slightly more restricted; conceptually, the piece is considered to pass through the adjacent orthogonal point, which must be unoccupied, rather than &quot;jumping&quot;. Another related piece is the &quot;keima&quot; of shogi, which moves like a knight but can move only two squares forward followed by one square sideways, restricting its movement to two possible squares.

===Names===
The knight is colloquially sometimes referred to as a &quot;horse&quot;, which is also the translation of the piece&#x27;s name in several languages: Spanish &quot;caballo&quot;, Italian &quot;cavallo&quot;, Russian &quot;конь&quot;, etc. Some languages refer to it as the &quot;jumper&quot;, reflecting the knight&#x27;s ability to move over pieces in its path: Polish &quot;skoczek&quot;, Danish/Norwegian &quot;springer&quot;, Swedish &quot;springare&quot;, German &quot;Springer&quot;, Luxembourgish &quot;Sprénger&quot;, Slovene &quot;skakač&quot;. In Sicilian it is called &quot;sceccu&quot;, a slang term for a donkey, derived from the Arabic &quot;sheikh&quot;, who during the Islamic period rode from village to village on donkeys collecting taxes.

==In mathematics==
The knight is relevant in some mathematical problems. For example, the knight&#x27;s tour problem is the problem of finding a series of moves by a knight on a chessboard in which every square is visited exactly once.

==Knight variations==
Even among sets of the standard Staunton pattern, the style of the pieces varies. The knights vary considerably. Here are some examples.
==Unicode==

Unicode defines three codepoints for a knight:

♘ U+2658 White Chess Knight

♞ U+265E Black Chess Knight

🨄 U+1FA04 Neutral Chess Knight

<doc id="47620" wikidata="Q319630" url="?curid=47620" title="Henry Clay">
<text>Henry Clay (April 12, 1777June 29, 1852) was an American lawyer and statesman who represented Kentucky in both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. He was the seventh House speaker as well as the ninth secretary of state. He unsuccessfully ran for president in the 1824, 1832, and 1844 elections. He helped found both the National Republican Party and the Whig Party. For his role in defusing sectional crises, he earned the appellation of the &quot;Great Compromiser&quot; and was part of the &quot;Great Triumvirate&quot; of Congressmen, alongside fellow Whig Daniel Webster and Democrat John C. Calhoun.

Clay was born in Virginia, in 1777, and began his legal career in Lexington, Kentucky, in 1797. As a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, Clay won election to the Kentucky state legislature in 1803 and to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1810. He was chosen as Speaker of the House in early 1811 and, along with President James Madison, led the United States into the War of 1812 against Great Britain. In 1814, he helped negotiate the Treaty of Ghent, which brought an end to the War of 1812, and then after the war, Clay returned to his position as Speaker of the House and developed the American System, which called for federal infrastructure investments, support for the national bank, and high protective tariff rates. In 1820 he helped bring an end to a sectional crisis over slavery by leading the passage of the Missouri Compromise. Clay finished with the fourth-most electoral votes in the multi-candidate 1824-1825 presidential election and used his position as speaker to help John Quincy Adams win the contingent election held to select the president. President Adams then appointed Clay to the prestigious position of secretary of state; as a result, critics alleged that the two had agreed to a &quot;corrupt bargain&quot;.

Despite receiving support from Clay and other National Republicans, Adams was defeated by Democrat Andrew Jackson in the 1828 presidential election. Clay won election to the Senate in 1831 and ran as the National Republican nominee in the 1832 presidential election, but he was defeated decisively by President Jackson. After the 1832 election, Clay helped bring an end to the nullification crisis by leading passage of the Tariff of 1833. During Jackson&#x27;s second term, opponents of the president including Clay, Webster, and William Henry Harrison created the Whig Party, and through the years, Clay became a leading congressional Whig.

Clay sought the presidency in the 1840 election but was passed over at the Whig National Convention in favor of Harrison. When Harrison died and his vice president John Tyler ascended to office in 1841, Clay clashed with Tyler, who broke with Clay and other congressional Whigs. Clay resigned from the Senate in 1842 and won the 1844 Whig presidential nomination, but he was narrowly defeated in the general election by Democrat James K. Polk, who made the annexation of the Republic of Texas his top issue. Clay strongly criticized the subsequent Mexican–American War and sought the Whig presidential nomination in 1848 but was passed over in favor of General Zachary Taylor who went on to win the election. After returning to the Senate in 1849, Clay played a key role in passing the Compromise of 1850, which postponed a crisis over the status of slavery in the territories. Clay was one of the most important and influential political figures of his era.

==Early life==
Henry Clay was born on April 12, 1777, at the Clay homestead in Hanover County, Virginia. He was the seventh of nine children born to the Reverend John Clay and Elizabeth (née Hudson) Clay. Almost all of Henry&#x27;s older siblings died before adulthood. His father, a Baptist minister nicknamed &quot;Sir John&quot;, died in 1781, leaving Henry and his brothers two slaves each; he also left his wife 18 slaves and of land. Clay was of entirely English descent; his ancestor, John Clay, settled in Virginia in 1613. The Clay family became a well-known political family including three other US senators, numerous state politicians, and Clay&#x27;s cousin Cassius Clay, a prominent anti-slavery activist active in the mid-19th century.

The British raided Clay&#x27;s home shortly after the death of his father, leaving the family in a precarious economic position. However, the widow Elizabeth Clay married Captain Henry Watkins, a successful planter and cousin to John Clay. Elizabeth would have seven more children with Watkins, bearing a total of sixteen children. Watkins became a kind and supportive stepfather and Clay had a very good relationship with him. After his mother&#x27;s remarriage, the young Clay remained in Hanover County, where he learned how to read and write. In 1791, Watkins moved the family to Kentucky, joining his brother in the pursuit of fertile new lands in the West. However, Clay did not follow, as Watkins secured his temporary employment in a Richmond emporium, with the promise that Clay would receive the next available clerkship at the Virginia Court of Chancery.

After Clay had worked at the Richmond emporium for a year, he obtained a clerkship that had become available at the Virginia Court of Chancery. Clay adapted well to his new role, and his handwriting earned him the attention of College of William &amp; Mary professor George Wythe, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, mentor of Thomas Jefferson, and judge on Virginia&#x27;s High Court of Chancery. Hampered by a crippled hand, Wythe chose Clay as his secretary and amanuensis, a role in which Clay would remain for four years. Clay began to read law under Wythe&#x27;s mentorship. Wythe had a powerful effect on Clay&#x27;s worldview, with Clay embracing Wythe&#x27;s belief that the example of the United States could help spread human freedom around the world. Wythe subsequently arranged a position for Clay with Virginia attorney general Robert Brooke, with the understanding that Brooke would finish Clay&#x27;s legal studies. After completing his studies under Brooke, Clay was admitted to the Virginia Bar in 1797.

==Marriage and family==

On April 11, 1799, Clay married Lucretia Hart (1781–1864) at the Hart home in Lexington, Kentucky. Her father, Colonel Thomas Hart, was an early settler of Kentucky and a prominent businessman. Hart proved to be an important business connection for Clay, as he helped Clay gain new clients and grow in professional stature. Hart was the namesake and grand-uncle of Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton and was also related to James Brown, a prominent Louisiana politician, and Isaac Shelby, the first governor of Kentucky. Henry and Lucretia would remain married until his death in 1852; she lived until 1864, dying at the age of 83. Both are buried at Lexington Cemetery.
Clay and Lucretia had eleven children (six daughters and five sons): Henrietta (born in 1800), Theodore (1802), Thomas (1803), Susan (1805), Anne (1807), Lucretia (1809), Henry Jr. (1811), Eliza (1813), Laura (1815), James (1817), and John (1821). By 1835, all six daughters had died of varying causes, two when very young, two as children, and the last two as young mothers. Henry Jr. was killed while commanding a regiment at the Battle of Buena Vista during the Mexican–American War. Clay&#x27;s oldest son, Theodore Wythe Clay, spent the second half of his life confined to a psychiatric hospital. When a young child, Theodore was injured by a blow to his head that fractured his skull. As he grew older his condition devolved into insanity, and from 1831 until his death in 1870 he was confined to an asylum in Lexington. Thomas (who had served some jail time in Philadelphia in 1829–1830) became a successful farmer, James established a legal practice (and later served in Congress), and John (who in his mid-20s was also confined to the asylum for a short time) became a successful horse breeder.

Clay was greatly interested in gambling, although he favored numerous restrictions and legal limitations on it. Famously, he once won $40,000 (approximately $970,000 as of 2020). Clay asked for $500 (approximately $12,000 today) and waived the remainder of the debt. Shortly afterward, Clay fell into a debt of $60,000 (approximately $1.5 million today) while gambling with the same man, who then asked for the $500 back and waived the rest of the debt.

They initially lived in Lexington, but in 1804 they began building a plantation outside of Lexington known as Ashland. The Ashland estate eventually encompassed over , with numerous outbuildings such as a smokehouse, a greenhouse, and several barns. There were 122 enslaved people at the estate during Clay&#x27;s lifetime, with about 50 people needed for farming and the household. He planted crops such as corn, wheat, and rye, as well as hemp, the chief crop of the Bluegrass region. Clay also took a strong interest in thoroughbred racing and imported livestock such as Arabian horses, Maltese donkeys, and Hereford cattle. Though Clay suffered some financial issues during economic downturns, he never fell deeply into debt and ultimately left his children a large inheritance. After the deaths of Anne and Susan, Clay and Lucretia raised several grandchildren at Ashland.

==Early career in law and politics==
===Legal career===
In November 1797, Clay relocated to Lexington, Kentucky, near where his parents and siblings resided. The Bluegrass region, with Lexington at its center, had quickly grown in the preceding decades but had only recently stopped being under the threat of Native American raids. Lexington was an established town that hosted Transylvania University, the first university west of the Appalachian Mountains. Having already passed the Virginia Bar, Clay quickly received a Kentucky license to practice law. After apprenticing himself to Kentucky attorneys such as George Nicholas, John Breckenridge, and James Brown, Clay established his own law practice, frequently working on debt collections and land disputes. Clay soon established a reputation for strong legal ability and courtroom oratory. In 1805, he was appointed to the faculty of Transylvania University where he taught, among others, future Kentucky Governor Robert P. Letcher and Robert Todd, the future father-in-law of Abraham Lincoln.

Clay&#x27;s most notable client was Aaron Burr, who was indicted for treason in the Burr conspiracy. Clay and his law partner John Allen successfully defended Burr without a fee in 1807. Thomas Jefferson later convinced Clay that Burr had been guilty of the charges. Clay&#x27;s legal practice was light after his election to Congress. In the 1823 case &quot;Green v. Biddle&quot;, Clay submitted the Supreme Court&#x27;s first amicus curiae. However, he lost that case.

===Early political career===
Clay entered politics shortly after arriving in Kentucky. In his first political speech, he attacked the Alien and Sedition Acts, laws passed by Federalists to suppress dissent during the Quasi-War with France. Like most Kentuckians, Clay was a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, but he clashed with state party leaders over a state constitutional convention. Using the pseudonym &quot;Scaevola&quot; (in reference to Gaius Mucius Scaevola), Clay advocated for direct elections for Kentucky elected officials and the gradual emancipation of slavery in Kentucky. The 1799 Kentucky Constitution included the direct election of public officials, but the state did not adopt Clay&#x27;s plan for gradual emancipation.

In 1803, Clay won election to the Kentucky House of Representatives. His first legislative initiative was the partisan gerrymander of Kentucky&#x27;s Electoral College districts, which ensured that all of Kentucky&#x27;s presidential electors voted for President Jefferson in the 1804 presidential election. Clay clashed with legislators who sought to reduce the power of Clay&#x27;s Bluegrass region, and he unsuccessfully advocated moving the state capitol from Frankfort to Lexington. Clay frequently opposed populist firebrand Felix Grundy, and he helped defeat Grundy&#x27;s effort to revoke the banking privileges of the state-owned Kentucky Insurance Company. He advocated for the construction of internal improvements, which would become a consistent theme throughout his public career. Clay&#x27;s influence in Kentucky state politics was such that in 1806 the Kentucky legislature elected him to the United States Senate. During his two-month tenure in the Senate, Clay advocated for the construction of various bridges and canals, including a canal connecting the Chesapeake Bay and the Delaware River.

After Clay returned to Kentucky in 1807, he was elected as the speaker of the state house of representatives. That same year, in response to attacks on American shipping by Britain and France during the Napoleonic Wars, President Jefferson arranged passage of the Embargo Act of 1807. In support of Jefferson&#x27;s policy, which limited trade with foreign powers, Clay introduced a resolution to require legislators to wear homespun suits rather than those made of imported British broadcloth. The vast majority of members of the state house voted for the measure, but Humphrey Marshall, an &quot;aristocratic lawyer who possessed a sarcastic tongue,&quot; voted against it. In early 1809, Clay challenged Marshall to a duel, which took place on January 19. While many contemporary duels were called off or fought without the intention of killing one another, both Clay and Marshall fought the duel with the intent of killing their opponent. They each had three turns to shoot; both were hit by bullets, but both survived. Clay quickly recovered from his injury and received only a minor censure from the Kentucky legislature.

In 1810, U.S. Senator Buckner Thruston resigned to accept appointment to a position as a federal judge, and Clay was selected by the legislature to fill Thruston&#x27;s seat. Clay quickly emerged as a fierce critic of British attacks on American shipping, becoming part of an informal group of &quot;war hawks&quot; who favored expansionist policies. He also advocated the annexation of West Florida, which was controlled by Spain. On the insistence of the Kentucky legislature, Clay helped prevent the re-charter of the First Bank of the United States, arguing that it interfered with state banks and infringed on states&#x27; rights. After serving in the Senate for one year, Clay decided that he disliked the rules of the Senate and instead sought election to the United States House of Representatives. He won election unopposed in late 1810.

==Speaker of the House==
===Election and leadership===
The 1810–1811 elections produced many young, anti-British members of Congress who, like Clay, supported going to war with Great Britain. Buoyed by the support of fellow war hawks, Clay was elected Speaker of the House for the 12th Congress. At 34, he was the youngest person to become speaker, a distinction he held until 1839, when 30-year-old Robert M. T. Hunter took office. He was also the first of only two new members elected speaker to date, the other being William Pennington in 1860.

Between 1810 and 1824, Clay was elected to seven terms in the House. His tenure was interrupted from 1814 to 1815 when he was a commissioner to peace talks with the British in Ghent, United Netherlands to end the War of 1812, and from 1821 to 1823, when he left Congress to rebuild his family&#x27;s fortune in the aftermath of the Panic of 1819. Elected speaker six times, Clay&#x27;s cumulative tenure in office of 10 years, 196 days, is the second-longest, surpassed only by Sam Rayburn.

As speaker, Clay wielded considerable power in making committee appointments, and like many of his predecessors he assigned his allies to important committees. Clay was exceptional in his ability to control the legislative agenda through well-placed allies and the establishment of new committees and departed from precedent by frequently taking part in floor debates. Yet he also gained a reputation for personal courteousness and fairness in his rulings and committee appointments. Clay&#x27;s drive to increase the power of the office of speaker was aided by President James Madison, who deferred to Congress in most matters. John Randolph, a member of the Democratic-Republican Party but also a member of the &quot;tertium quids&quot; group that opposed many federal initiatives, emerged as a prominent opponent of Speaker Clay. While Randolph frequently attempted to obstruct Clay&#x27;s initiatives, Clay became a master of parliamentary maneuvers that enabled him to advance his agenda even over the attempted obstruction by Randolph and others.

===Madison administration, 1811–1817===
Clay and other war hawks demanded that the British revoke the Orders in Council, a series of decrees that had resulted in a de facto commercial war with the United States. Though Clay recognized the dangers inherent in fighting Britain, one of the most powerful countries in the world, he saw it as the only realistic alternative to a humiliating submission to British attacks on American shipping. Clay led a successful effort in the House to declare war against Britain, complying with a request from President Madison. Madison signed the declaration of war on June 18, 1812, beginning the War of 1812. During the war, Clay frequently communicated with Secretary of State James Monroe and Secretary of War William Eustis, though he advocated for the replacement of the latter. The war started poorly for the Americans, and Clay lost friends and relatives in the fighting. In October 1813, the British asked Madison to begin negotiations in Europe, and Madison asked Clay to join his diplomatic team, as the president hoped that the presence of the leading war hawk would ensure support for a peace treaty. Clay was reluctant to leave Congress but felt duty-bound to accept the offer, and so he resigned from Congress on January 19, 1814.

Clay left the country on February 25, but negotiations with the British did not begin until August 1814. Clay was part of a team of five commissioners that included Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin, Senator James Bayard, ambassador Jonathan Russell, and ambassador John Quincy Adams, the head of the American team. Clay and Adams maintained an uneasy relationship marked by frequent clashes, and Gallatin emerged as the unofficial leader of the American team. When the British finally presented their initial peace offer, Clay was outraged by its terms, especially the British proposal for an Indian barrier state on the Great Lakes. After a series of American military successes in 1814, the British delegation made several concessions and offered a better peace deal. While Adams and Gallatin were eager to make peace as quickly as possible even if that required sub-optimal terms in the peace treaty, Clay believed that the British, worn down by years of fighting against France, greatly desired peace with the United States. Partly due to Clay&#x27;s hard-line stance, the Treaty of Ghent included relatively favorable terms for the United States, essentially re-establishing the &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot; between Britain and the U.S. The treaty was signed on December 24, 1814, bringing a close to the War of 1812. After the signing of the treaty, Clay briefly traveled to London, where he helped Gallatin negotiate a commercial agreement with Britain.

Clay returned to the United States in September 1815; despite his absence, he had been elected to another term in the House of Representatives. Upon his return to Congress, Clay won election as Speaker of the House. The War of 1812 strengthened Clay&#x27;s support for interventionist economic policies such as federally funded internal improvements, which he believed were necessary to improve the country&#x27;s infrastructure system. He eagerly embraced President Madison&#x27;s ambitious domestic package, which included infrastructure investment, tariffs to protect domestic manufacturing, and spending increases for the army and navy. With the help of John C. Calhoun and William Lowndes, Clay passed the Tariff of 1816, which served the dual purpose of raising revenue and protecting American manufacturing. To stabilize the currency, Clay and Treasury Secretary Alexander Dallas arranged passage of a bill establishing the Second Bank of the United States (also known as the national bank). Clay also supported the Bonus Bill of 1817, which would have provided a fund for internal improvements, but Madison vetoed the bill on constitutional concerns. Beginning in 1818, Clay advocated for an economic plan known as the &quot;American System,&quot; which encompassed many of the economic measures, including protective tariffs and infrastructure investments, that he helped pass in the aftermath of the War of 1812.

===Monroe administration, 1817–1825===
Like Jefferson and George Washington, President Madison decided to retire after two terms, leaving open the Democratic-Republican nomination for the 1816 presidential election. At the time, the Democratic-Republicans used a congressional nominating caucus to choose their presidential nominees, giving congressmen a powerful role in the presidential selection process. Monroe and Secretary of War William Crawford emerged as the two main candidates for the Democratic-Republican nomination. Clay had a favorable opinion of both individuals, but he supported Monroe, who won the nomination and went on to defeat Federalist candidate Rufus King in the general election. Monroe offered Clay the position of secretary of war, but Clay strongly desired the office of secretary of state and was angered when Monroe instead chose John Quincy Adams for that position. Clay became so bitter that he refused to allow Monroe&#x27;s inauguration to take place in the House Chamber and subsequently did not attend Monroe&#x27;s outdoor inauguration. 

In early 1819, a dispute erupted over the proposed statehood of Missouri after New York Congressman James Tallmadge introduced a legislative amendment that would provide for the gradual emancipation of Missouri&#x27;s slaves. Though Clay had previously called for gradual emancipation in Kentucky, he sided with the Southerners in voting down Tallmadge&#x27;s amendment. Clay instead supported Illinois Senator Jesse B. Thomas&#x27;s compromise proposal in which Missouri would be admitted as a slave state, Maine would be admitted as a free state, and slavery would be forbidden in the territories north of 36° 30&#x27; parallel. Clay helped assemble a coalition that passed the Missouri Compromise, as Thomas&#x27;s proposal became known. Further controversy ensued when Missouri&#x27;s constitution banned free blacks from entering the state, but Clay was able to engineer another compromise that allowed Missouri to join as a state in August 1821.

In foreign policy, Clay was a leading American supporter of the independence movements and revolutions that broke out in Latin America beginning in 1810. Clay frequently called on the Monroe administration to recognize the fledgling Latin American republics, but Monroe feared that doing so would derail his plans to acquire Spanish Florida. In 1818, General Andrew Jackson crossed into Spanish Florida to suppress raids by Seminole Indians. Though Jackson was following Monroe&#x27;s implied wishes in entering Florida, he created additional controversy in seizing the Spanish town of Pensacola. Despite protests from Secretary of War Calhoun, Monroe and Adams decided to support Jackson&#x27;s actions in the hope that they would convince Spain to sell Florida. Clay, however, was outraged, and he publicly condemned Jackson&#x27;s decision to hang two foreign nationals without a trial. Before the House chamber, he compared Jackson to military dictators of the past, telling his colleagues &quot;that Greece had her Alexander, Rome her Caesar, England her Cromwell, France her Bonaparte, and, that if we would escape the rock on which they split, we must avoid their errors.&quot; Jackson saw Clay&#x27;s protestations as an attack on his character and thus began a long rivalry between Clay and Jackson. The rivalry and the controversy over Jackson&#x27;s expedition temporarily subsided after the signing of the Adams–Onís Treaty, in which the U.S. purchased Florida and delineated its western boundary with New Spain.

====1824 presidential election====

By 1822, several members of the Democratic-Republican Party had begun exploring presidential bids to succeed Monroe, who planned to retire after two terms like his predecessors. As the Federalist Party was near collapse, the 1824 presidential election would be contested only by members of the Democratic-Republican Party, including Clay. Having led the passage of the Tariff of 1824 and the General Survey Act, Clay campaigned on his American System of high tariffs and federal spending on infrastructure. Three members of Monroe&#x27;s Cabinet, Secretary of the Treasury William Crawford, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, and Secretary of War John C. Calhoun, appeared to be Clay&#x27;s strongest competitors for the presidency. Though many, including Clay, did not take his candidacy seriously at first, General Andrew Jackson emerged as a presidential contender, eroding Clay&#x27;s base of support in the western states. In February 1824, the sparsely attended Democratic-Republican congressional caucus endorsed Crawford&#x27;s candidacy, but Crawford&#x27;s rivals ignored the caucus results, and various state legislatures nominated candidates for president. During the campaign, Crawford suffered a major stroke, while Calhoun withdrew from the race after Jackson won the endorsement of the Pennsylvania legislature.

By 1824, with Crawford still in the race, Clay concluded that no candidate would win a majority of electoral votes; in that scenario, the House of Representatives would hold a contingent election to decide the election. Under the terms of the Twelfth Amendment, the top three electoral vote-getters would be eligible to be elected by the House. Clay was confident that he would prevail in a contingent held in the chamber he presided over, so long as he was eligible for election. Clay won Kentucky, Ohio, and Missouri, but his loss in New York and Louisiana relegated him to a fourth-place finish behind Adams, Jackson, and Crawford. Clay was humiliated that he finished behind the invalid Crawford and Jackson, but supporters of the three remaining presidential candidates immediately began courting his support for the contingent election.

For various reasons, supporters of all three candidates believed they had the best chance of winning Clay&#x27;s backing, but Clay quickly settled on supporting Adams. Of the three candidates, Adams was the most sympathetic to Clay&#x27;s American System, and Clay viewed both Jackson and the sickly Crawford as unsuitable for the presidency. On January 9, 1825, Clay privately met with Adams for three hours, after which Clay promised Adams his support; both would later claim that they did not discuss Clay&#x27;s position in an Adams administration. With the help of Clay, Adams won the House vote on the first ballot. After his election, Adams offered Clay the position of secretary of state, which Clay accepted, despite fears that he would be accused of trading his support for the Cabinet post. Jackson was outraged by the election, and he and his supporters accused Clay and Adams of having reached a &quot;Corrupt Bargain.&quot; Pro-Jackson forces immediately began preparing for the 1828 presidential election, with the Corrupt Bargain accusation becoming their central issue.

==Secretary of State==

Clay served as secretary of state from 1825 to 1829. As secretary of state, he was the top foreign policy official in the Adams administration, but he also held several domestic duties, such as oversight of the patent office. Clay came to like Adams, a former rival, and to despise Jackson. They developed a strong working relationship. Adams and Clay were both wary of forming entangling alliances with the emerging states, and they continued to uphold the Monroe Doctrine, which called for European non-intervention in former colonies. Clay was rebuffed in his efforts to reach a commercial treaty and a settlement of the Canada–United States border with Britain, and was also unsuccessful in his attempts to make the French pay for damages arising from attacks on American shipping during the Napoleonic Wars. He had more success in negotiating commercial treaties with Latin American republics, reaching &quot;most favoured nation&quot; trade agreements in an attempt to ensure that no European country had a trading advantage over the United States. Seeking deeper relations with Latin American countries, Clay strongly favored sending American delegates to the Congress of Panama, but his efforts were defeated by opponents in the Senate.

Adams proposed an ambitious domestic program based in large part on Clay&#x27;s American System, but Clay warned the president that many of his proposals held little chance of passage in the 19th Congress. Adams&#x27;s opponents defeated many of his proposals, including the establishment of a naval academy and a national observatory, but Adams did preside over the construction or initiation of major infrastructure projects like the National Road and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. Followers of Adams began to call themselves National Republicans, and Jackson&#x27;s followers became known as Democrats. Both campaigns spread untrue stories about the opposing candidates. Adams&#x27; followers denounced Jackson as a demagogue, and some Adams-aligned papers accused Jackson&#x27;s wife Rachel of bigamy. Though Clay was not directly involved in these attacks, his failure to denounce them earned him the lifelong enmity of Jackson.

Clay was one of Adams&#x27;s most important political advisers, but because of his myriad responsibilities as secretary of state, he was often unable to take part in campaigning. As Adams was averse to the use of patronage for political purposes, Jackson&#x27;s campaign enjoyed a marked advantage in organization, and Adams&#x27; allies such as Clay and Daniel Webster were unable to create an equally powerful organization headed by the president. In the 1828 election, Jackson took 56% of the popular vote and won almost every state outside of New England; Clay was especially distressed by Jackson&#x27;s victory in Kentucky. The election result represented not only the victory of a man Clay viewed as unqualified and unprincipled but also a rejection of Clay&#x27;s domestic policies.

==Later career==
===Jackson administration, 1829–1837===

====Return to the Senate====
Even with Clay out of office, President Jackson continued to see Clay as one of his major rivals, and Jackson at one point suspected Clay of being behind the Petticoat affair, a controversy involving the wives of his Cabinet members. Clay strongly opposed the 1830 Indian Removal Act, which authorized the administration to relocate Native Americans to land west of the Mississippi River. Another key point of contention between Clay and Jackson was the proposed Maysville Road, which would connect Maysville, Kentucky, to the National Road in Zanesville, Ohio; transportation advocates hoped that later extensions would eventually connect the National Road to New Orleans. In 1830, Jackson vetoed the project both because he felt that the road did not constitute interstate commerce, and also because he generally opposed using the federal government to promote economic modernization. While Jackson&#x27;s veto garnered support from opponents of infrastructure spending, it damaged his base of support in Clay&#x27;s home state of Kentucky. Clay returned to federal office in 1831 by winning election to the Senate over Richard Mentor Johnson in a 73 to 64 vote of the Kentucky legislature. His return to the Senate after 20 years, 8 months, 7 days out of office, marks the fourth-longest gap in service to the chamber in history.

====Bank War and the 1832 presidential election====

With the defeat of Adams, Clay became the de facto leader of the National Republicans, and he began making preparations for a presidential campaign in the 1832 election. In 1831, Jackson made it clear that he was going to run for re-election, ensuring that support or opposition to his presidency would be a central feature of the upcoming race. Jackson&#x27;s Democrats rallied around his policies towards the national bank, internal improvements, Indian removal, and nullification, but these policies also earned Jackson various enemies, including Vice President John C. Calhoun. However, Clay rejected overtures from the fledgling Anti-Masonic Party, and his attempt to convince Calhoun to serve as his running mate failed, leaving the opposition to Jackson split among different factions. Inspired by the Anti-Masonic Party&#x27;s national convention, Clay&#x27;s National Republican followers arranged for a national convention that nominated Clay for president.

As the 1832 election approached, the debate over the re-authorization of the national bank emerged as the most important issue in the campaign. By the early 1830s, the national bank had become the largest corporation in the United States, and banknotes issued by the national bank served as the de facto legal tender of the United States. Jackson disliked the national bank because of a hatred of both banks and paper currency. The bank&#x27;s charter did not expire until 1836, but bank president Nicholas Biddle asked for renewal in 1831, hoping that election year pressure and support from Secretary of the Treasury Louis McLane would convince Jackson to allow the re-charter. Biddle&#x27;s application set off the &quot;Bank War&quot;; Congress passed a bill to renew the national bank&#x27;s charter, but Jackson vetoed it, holding the bank to be unconstitutional. Clay had initially hoped that the national bank re-charter would work to his advantage, but Jackson&#x27;s allies seized on the issue, redefining the 1832 election as a choice between the president and a &quot;monied oligarchy.&quot; Ultimately, Clay was unable to defeat a popular sitting president. Jackson won 219 of the 286 electoral votes and 54.2% of the popular vote, carrying almost every state outside of New England.

====Nullification Crisis====
The high rates of the Tariff of 1828 and the Tariff of 1832 angered many Southerners because they resulted in higher prices for imported goods. After the 1832 election, South Carolina held a state convention that declared the tariff rates of 1828 and 1832 to be nullified within the state, and further declared that federal collection of import duties would be illegal after January 1833. In response to this Nullification Crisis, Jackson issued his Proclamation to the People of South Carolina, which strongly denied the right of states to nullify federal laws or secede. He asked Congress to pass what became known as the Force Bill, which would authorize the president to send federal soldiers against South Carolina if it sought to nullify federal law.

Though Clay favored high tariff rates, he found Jackson&#x27;s strong rhetoric against South Carolina distressing and sought to avoid a crisis that could end in civil war. He proposed a compromise tariff bill that would lower tariff rates, but do so gradually, thereby giving manufacturing interests time to adapt to less protective rates. Clay&#x27;s compromise tariff won the backing of both manufacturers, who believed they would not receive a better deal, and Calhoun, who sought a way out of the crisis but refused to work with President Jackson&#x27;s supporters on an alternative tariff bill. Though most members of Clay&#x27;s own National Republican Party opposed it, the Tariff of 1833 passed both houses of Congress. Jackson simultaneously signed the tariff bill and the Force bill, and South Carolina leaders accepted the new tariff, effectively bringing the crisis to an end. Clay&#x27;s role in resolving the crisis brought him renewed national stature in the wake of a crushing presidential election defeat, and some began referring to him as the &quot;Great Compromiser.&quot;

====Formation of the Whig Party====
Following the end of the Nullification Crisis in March 1833, Jackson renewed his offensive against the national bank, despite some opposition from within his own Cabinet. Jackson and Secretary of the Treasury Roger Taney pursued a policy of removing all federal deposits from the national bank and placing them in state-chartered banks known as &quot;pet banks.&quot; Because federal law required the president to deposit federal revenue in the national bank so long as it was financially stable, many regarded Jackson&#x27;s actions as illegal, and Clay led the passage of a Senate motion censuring Jackson. Nonetheless, the national bank&#x27;s federal charter expired in 1836, and though the institution continued to function under a Pennsylvania charter, it never regained the influence it had had at the beginning of Jackson&#x27;s administration.

The removal of deposits helped unite Jackson&#x27;s opponents into one party for the first time, as National Republicans, Calhounites, former Democrats, and members of the Anti-Masonic Party coalesced into the Whig Party. The term &quot;Whig&quot; originated from a speech Clay delivered in 1834, in which he compared opponents of Jackson to the Whigs, a British political party opposed to absolute monarchy. Neither the Whigs nor the Democrats were unified geographically or ideologically. However, Whigs tended to favor a stronger legislature, a stronger federal government, a higher tariff, greater spending on infrastructure, re-authorization of the Second Bank of the United States, and publicly funded education. Conversely, Democrats tended to favor a stronger president, stronger state governments, lower tariffs, hard money, and expansionism. Neither party took a strong national stand on slavery. The Whig base of support lay in wealthy businessmen, professionals, the professional class, and large planters, while the Democratic base of support lay in immigrant Catholics and yeomen farmers, but each party appealed across class lines.

Partly due to grief over the death of his daughter, Anne, Clay chose not to run in the 1836 presidential election, and the Whigs were too disorganized to nominate a single candidate. Three Whig candidates ran against Van Buren: General William Henry Harrison, Senator Hugh Lawson White, and Senator Daniel Webster. By running multiple candidates, the Whigs hoped to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives. Clay personally preferred Webster, but he threw his backing behind Harrison who had the broadest appeal among voters. Clay&#x27;s decision not to endorse Webster opened a rift between the two Whig party leaders, and Webster would work against Clay in future presidential elections. Despite the presence of multiple Whig candidates, Van Buren won the 1836 election with 50.8 percent of the popular vote and 170 of the 294 electoral votes.

===Van Buren administration, 1837–1841===

Van Buren&#x27;s presidency was affected badly by the Panic of 1837, a major recession that badly damaged the Democratic Party. Clay and other Whigs argued that Jackson&#x27;s policies, including the use of pet banks, had encouraged speculation and caused the panic. He promoted the American System as a means for economic recovery, but President Van Buren&#x27;s response focused on the practice of &quot;strict economy and frugality.&quot; As the 1840 presidential election approached, many expected that the Whigs would win control of the presidency due to the ongoing economic crisis. Clay initially viewed Webster as his strongest rival, but Clay, Harrison, and General Winfield Scott emerged as the principal candidates at the 1839 Whig National Convention.

Though he was widely regarded as the most qualified Whig leader to serve as president, many Whigs questioned Clay&#x27;s electability after two presidential election defeats. He also faced opposition in the North due to his ownership of slaves and lingering association with the Freemasons, and in the South from Whigs who distrusted his moderate stance on slavery. Clay won a plurality on the first ballot of the Whig National Convention, but, with the help of Thurlow Weed and other backers, Harrison consolidated support on subsequent ballots and won the Whig presidential nomination on the fifth ballot of the convention. Seeking to placate Clay&#x27;s supporters and to balance the ticket geographically, the convention chose former Virginia Governor and Senator John Tyler, a personal friend of Clay, whose previous career in the Democratic Party had practically come to an end, as the vice-presidential nominee. Clay was disappointed by the outcome but helped Harrison&#x27;s ultimately successful campaign by delivering numerous speeches. With Whigs also winning control of Congress in the 1840 elections, Clay saw the upcoming 27th Congress as an opportunity for the Whig Party to establish itself as the dominant political party by leading the country out of recession.

===Harrison and Tyler administrations, 1841–1845===
President-elect Harrison asked Clay to serve another term as Secretary of State, but Clay chose to remain in Congress. Webster was instead chosen as Secretary of State, while John J. Crittenden, a close ally of Clay, was chosen as Attorney General. As Harrison prepared to take office, Clay and Harrison clashed over the leadership of the Whig Party, with Harrison sensitive to accusations that he would answer to Clay. Just a month into his presidency, Harrison died of an illness and was succeeded by Vice President John Tyler. Tyler retained Harrison&#x27;s Cabinet, but the former Democrat and avid follower of both Jefferson&#x27;s and Jackson&#x27;s philosophy quickly made it known that he had reservations about re-establishing a national bank, a key priority of Clay&#x27;s. Clay nonetheless initially expected that Tyler would approve the measures passed by the Whig-controlled Congress; his priorities included the re-establishment of the national bank, higher tariff rates, a national bankruptcy law, and an act to distribute the proceeds of land sales to the states for investments in infrastructure and education. Clay and his congressional allies attempted to craft a national bank bill acceptable to Tyler, but Tyler vetoed two separate bills to re-establish the national bank, showing that he in fact had no will to reach a solution for the party&#x27;s issues. Clay and other Whig leaders were now outraged not only by Tyler&#x27;s rejection of the Whig party platform but also because they felt that Tyler had purposely misled them into thinking that he would sign the bills.

After the second veto, congressional Whigs voted to expel Tyler from the party, and on Clay&#x27;s request, every Cabinet member except for Webster, who wanted to continue negotiating the Webster-Ashburton Treaty with Great Britain about the border to Canada, resigned from office. This made Tyler increasingly move closer to his former Democratic Party and, with Webster still serving in the Tyler administration, Clay emerged as the clear leader of the Whig Party. In early 1842, Clay resigned from the Senate after arranging for Crittenden to succeed him. Though he vetoed other Whig bills, Tyler did sign some Whig priorities into law, including the Preemption Act of 1841, which distributed the proceeds of land sales to the states, and the Bankruptcy Act of 1841, which was the first law in U.S. history that allowed for voluntary bankruptcy. Facing a large budget deficit, Tyler also signed the Tariff of 1842, which restored the protective rates of the Tariff of 1832 but ended the distribution policy that had been established with the Preemption Act of 1841.

====1844 presidential election====

President Tyler&#x27;s break with the Whig Party, combined with Webster&#x27;s continuing affiliation with Tyler, positioned Clay as the leading contender for the Whig nomination in the 1844 presidential election. By 1842, most observers believed that Clay would face Van Buren in the 1844 presidential election, as he had still remained as the clear leader of the Democrats and, following the tradition of the founders, wanted a second term. Hoping to win another term, President Tyler forged an alliance with John C. Calhoun and pursued the annexation of the Republic of Texas, which would add another slave state to the union. After President Tyler concluded an annexation treaty with Texas, Clay announced his opposition to annexation. He argued that the country needed &quot;union, peace, and patience,&quot; and annexation would bring tensions over slavery and war with Mexico. The same day that Clay published a letter opposing the annexation of Texas, Van Buren also came out against annexation, citing similar reasons as Clay, so that slavery and especially expansionism seemed to play no role in the next election. Clay unanimously won the presidential nomination at the 1844 Whig National Convention, but a minority of expansionist Southern Democrats, encouraged by Tyler&#x27;s alternative outline, blocked Van Buren&#x27;s nomination at the 1844 Democratic National Convention for countless ballots, until Van Buren withdrew, making place for an unexpected compromise candidate: The party nominated former Speaker of the House James K. Polk of Tennessee, who favored annexation, but in order to calm anti-expansionists, promised to just run for a single term. Following the nomination of a pro-annexation Democrat, Tyler soon ended his incipient independent run for president and endorsed Polk.

Clay was surprised by Van Buren&#x27;s defeat but remained confident of his chances in the 1844 election. Polk was the first &quot;dark horse&quot; presidential nominee in U.S. history, and Whigs mocked him as a &quot;fourth rate politician.&quot; Despite his relative lack of national stature, Polk proved to be a strong candidate capable of uniting the factions of the Democratic Party and winning the support of Southerners who had been reluctant to support Van Buren. Clay&#x27;s stance on slavery alienated some voters in both the North and the South. Pro-slavery Southerners flocked to Polk, while many Northern abolitionists, who tended to align with the Whig Party, favored James G. Birney of the Liberty Party. Clay&#x27;s opposition to annexation damaged his campaign in the South, as Democrats argued that he worked in unison with Northerners to stop the extension of slavery. In July, Clay wrote two letters in which he attempted to clarify his position on the annexation of Texas, and Democrats attacked his supposedly inconsistent position.

Polk narrowly won the election, taking 49.5% of the popular vote and 170 of the 275 electoral votes. Birney won several thousand anti-annexation votes in New York, and his presence in the race may have cost Clay the election. Most of Clay&#x27;s contemporaries believed that annexation had been the decisive issue in the race, but Polk&#x27;s savvy campaigning on the tariff may have also been decisive, as he narrowly won pro-tariff Pennsylvania after downplaying his anti-tariff views. After Polk&#x27;s victory and the final indirect success of Tyler&#x27;s strategy, Congress approved the annexation of Texas, which was signed by Tyler on his last day in office, and Texas gained statehood in late 1845.

===Polk administration, 1845–1849===


After the 1844 election, Clay returned to his career as an attorney. Though he was no longer a member of Congress, he remained closely interested in national politics. In 1846, the Mexican–American War broke out after American and Mexican forces clashed at the disputed border region between Mexico and Texas. Initially, Clay did not publicly oppose the war, but privately he saw it as an immoral war that risked producing &quot;some military chieftain who will conquer us all.&quot; He suffered a personal blow in 1847 when his son, Henry Clay Jr., died at the Battle of Buena Vista. In November 1847, Clay re-emerged on the political scene with a speech that was harshly critical of the Mexican–American War and President Polk. He attacked Polk for fomenting the conflict with Mexico and urged the rejection of any treaty that added new slave territory to the United States. Months after the speech, the Senate ratified the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, in which Mexico ceded hundreds of thousands of square miles of territory known as the Mexican Cession.

By 1847, General Zachary Taylor, who commanded the American forces at Buena Vista, had emerged as a contender for the Whig nomination in the 1848 presidential election. Despite Taylor&#x27;s largely unknown political views, many Whigs believed he was the party&#x27;s strongest possible candidate due to his martial accomplishments in the Mexican–American War. One of Clay&#x27;s most trusted allies and advisers, John J. Crittenden, was Taylor&#x27;s de facto campaign manager. Clay had initially told his allies that he would not run in the 1848 presidential election, but he was unwilling to support Taylor, a &quot;mere military man.&quot; On April 10, 1848, he announced his candidacy for the Whig nomination. Although Webster and Winfield Scott each commanded a limited base of support in the party, Taylor and Clay each saw the other as their lone serious rival for the Whig nomination. As Taylor commanded the support of most Southern Whigs, Clay focused his efforts on courting Northern Whigs, emphasizing his opposition to the Mexican–American War and his life-long support for the gradual emancipation of slaves in Kentucky. Clay presented a strong challenge to Taylor at the 1848 Whig National Convention, but Taylor won the presidential nomination on the fourth ballot. Partially in an attempt to please the Clay wing of the party, the convention nominated Millard Fillmore as Taylor&#x27;s running mate. Clay was embittered by his failure at the convention, and he did not campaign on behalf of Taylor. Nonetheless, Taylor won the election, taking 47.3 percent of the popular vote and 163 of 290 electoral votes.

===Taylor and Fillmore administrations, 1849–1852===

Increasingly worried about the sectional tensions arising over the issue of slavery in newly acquired territories, Clay accepted election to the Senate in 1849. Having refused to campaign for Taylor, Clay played little role in the formation of Taylor&#x27;s Cabinet or in determining the new administration&#x27;s policies. In January 1850, with Congress still deadlocked regarding the status of the Mexican Cession, Clay proposed a compromise designed to organize territory acquired in the Mexican–American War and address other issues contributing to sectional tensions. His legislative package included the admission of California as a free state, the cession by Texas of some of its northern and western territorial claims in return for debt relief, the establishment of New Mexico and Utah territories, a ban on the importation of slaves into the District of Columbia for sale, and a more stringent fugitive slave law. Though it faced opposition from Southern extremists like Calhoun and Northern abolitionists like William Seward, Clay&#x27;s proposal won the backing of many Southern and Northern leaders.

President Taylor, who favored the immediate admission of California and New Mexico as free states without any attached conditions, opposed the plan, and Clay openly broke with the president in May 1850. Debate over Clay&#x27;s proposal continued into July when Taylor unexpectedly died of an illness. After Taylor&#x27;s death, President Fillmore, who supported Clay&#x27;s compromise bill, consulted with Clay in appointing a new Cabinet. Exhausted by the debate in the Senate, Clay took a leave of absence shortly after Taylor&#x27;s death, but Fillmore, Webster, and Democratic Senator Stephen A. Douglas took charge of pro-compromise forces. By the end of September 1850, Clay&#x27;s proposal, which became known as the Compromise of 1850, had been enacted. Though contemporaries credited Fillmore, Douglas, and Webster for their role in passing the Compromise of 1850, Clay was widely regarded as the key figure in ending a major sectional crisis.

==Death==
In December 1851, at the age of 74, with his health declining, Clay announced that he would resign from the Senate the following September. Clay never recovered from his illnesses. He eventually died of tuberculosis aged 75 in his room at the National Hotel in Washington, D.C., on June 29, 1852. He was the first person to lie in state in the United States Capitol rotunda.

Clay&#x27;s headstone reads: &quot;I know no North—no South—no East—no West&quot;. Hymn writer Fanny Crosby penned this line of lament on Clay&#x27;s death:

==Ideology and slavery==
===American System===
Throughout most of his political life, Clay promoted his American System as both an economic program and a means for unifying the country. Clay&#x27;s American System rejected strict constructionism in favor of an activist government that would promote industry and commerce. The American System had four key tenets: high tariffs, a stable financial system, federal investment in internal improvements, and a public land sale policy designed to raise revenue and provide for carefully managed expansion into the American frontier. Through high tariffs, Clay hoped to free the United States from dependence on foreign imports, especially from Britain. Clay sought to ensure a stable financial system through support for the national bank, which regulated the country&#x27;s banking system and helped ensure a consistent supply of credit. Clay&#x27;s support for federally financed internal improvements stemmed from his belief that only the federal government could construct the transportation system necessary for uniting the country commercially and culturally. His land policy focused on using federal revenue from land sales to fund states&#x27; investments in education, infrastructure projects, and other priorities.

===Practices as an enslaver and the Dupuy case===

Clay inherited slaves as a young child, and he continued to own slaves throughout his life. In the 1790s, he adopted anti-slavery views under the influence of his mentor, Founding Father George Wythe, who emancipated his own human property. Like most of his contemporaries, Clay was not a racial egalitarian and never called for the immediate abolition of slavery, but he viewed slavery as a &quot;grievous wrong to the slave&quot; and spoke in favor of equal treatment for free blacks. Early in his career, Clay favored gradual emancipation in both Kentucky and Missouri, but each state rejected plans that would have provided for gradual emancipation. Clay continued to support gradual emancipation throughout his career and published an open letter in 1849 calling for gradual emancipation in Kentucky, though he qualified this view by stating he would only support emancipation if it included a plan for colonizing free blacks outside of the state. Unlike many other Southern leaders, he consistently favored recognition of Haiti, which had been established through a slave revolt.

In 1816, Clay helped establish the American Colonization Society, a group that wanted to establish a colony for free American blacks in Africa. The group was made up of abolitionists who wanted to end slavery and slaveholders who wanted to deport free blacks. Clay&#x27;s support for colonization reflected his belief that a multiracial society was ultimately unworkable, both for whites and free blacks. Under Clay&#x27;s plan, all enslaved children born after 1860 would be freed at age 25. At that time, they were to work for three years in order to finance their own importation. During this period, enslavers could still sell or mortgage their human property. Some abolitionists did not view this plan favorably. In 1849, Frederick Douglass denounced this plan in a speech to the New England Anti-Slavery Society at Faneuil Hall. He objected to the three years when the enslaved were in jeopardy as they were still held as property. The date of 1860 would lead to family separations as those born before 1860 would remain enslaved and those born after were subjected to a mandatory importation. Those gathered first applauded at the mention of Clay; however, once Douglass made these points, those gathered change their response to hisses and cries of shame. Later in his career, Clay became increasingly concerned about abolitionism, remarking that &quot;the ultraism of the South on the one hand ... and the ultraism of abolition on the other&quot; represented the greatest threat to the Union. Nonetheless, he consistently defended the right of abolitionists to send materials through the mail and opposed the gag rule, which limited congressional debate on slavery.
On his 600-acre plantation, there were 122 slaves held over the course of his life. Clay&#x27;s status as a slave owner and his anti-slavery views occasionally led to conflicts in his political career. During a visit to Indiana in the 1840s, Clay was confronted at a political meeting by a Quaker abolitionist, Hiram Mendenhall, who presented Clay with a petition calling on him to free his slaves. Clay dismissed Mendenhall out of hand, stating that the petition was no different from if it demanded he give up his farm. Many of his contemporaries, including anti-slavery activist James G. Birney, believed that Clay&#x27;s home state of Kentucky had the laws most permissive to slaves of any slave state. Clay considered himself to be a &quot;good&quot; master. Biographer James C. Klotter concludes that Clay took actions, such as keeping families together, to mitigate the harshness of slavery; however, showing the opposite is his treatment of the family of Lewis Hayden. Klotter also states that there is no evidence that Clay ever had sex with any of his slaves. Others state quite the contrary of his punitive and sexual practices.

In 1844, Clay&#x27;s wife discovered that he was having relations with the &quot;yellow girl that attended his poultry and fowls&quot;. The young woman and her children were then sent to Louisiana to be sold. While in Washington, D.C., Clay acquired an octoroon to serve as concubine. Phoebe Moore, age 16, was purchased by Henry Clay from his wife&#x27;s cousin, Senator Thomas Hart Benton, according to her obituary in New Orleans &quot;Times-Picayune&quot;&quot;.&quot; When he was in Washington, she resided with Clay in his Washington home and bore him two children. After he emancipated her, she moved to Memphis, Tennessee.
Regarding keeping families together, Clay applied the opposite to the family of Lewis Hayden. Around 1836. Clay had an enslaved mother, Esther Harvey, and her son, sold South. They were the family of Lewis Hayden, a waiter at the upscale Phoenix Hotel. Around 1842, Hayden was threatened, also by Clay, with the sale of his second wife, Harriet Bell Hayden and her son Joseph who he had adopted. Hayden secured the aid of Vermont resident Delia Webster and Oberlin College student Rev. Calvin Fairbank through the assistance of John Mifflin, AME minister and resident of Oberlin, Ohio. They crafted a successful escape plan via the Underground Railroad through Maysville, Kentucky, across the Ohio River to the free states of Ohio and Michigan. The Haydens became residents of Amherstburg, Ontario, Canada. On January 4, 1845, Webster received a sentence of two years hard labor for her part in the escape; she was pardoned on February 24, 1845. Also during February, Fairbank was sentenced to 15 years. The Kentucky governor pardoned him in 1849. However, he was imprisoned again in 1852 and served 12 years for aiding in another escape.

Another example is Lewis Richardson, Clay&#x27;s self-emancipated slave. He gave a speech that belies Clay&#x27;s self-portrayal as a &quot;good master&quot;. Richardson had been enslaved at Ashland for 20 years, and after a beating escaped via the Underground Railroad in January, 1846. By May of that year, Richardson was also living in Amherstburg, Ontario. In a speech he gave at Union Chapel there, he told not only of continual sparse food and lack of warm clothing but of 150 lashes from overseer Ambrose Brice for the offense of being an hour late returning from a visit to his wife. Brice later denied this claim, stating it was 16 lashes, and the offense was drunkenness. Clay was away on business when this occurred. Richardson&#x27;s speech was published in the abolitionist newspaper &quot;Signal of Liberty&quot;. The text of his speech is available at the following reference.

In 1829, Charlotte Dupuy, who was enslaved by Clay, sued for her freedom while visiting relatives in Maryland. Dupuy&#x27;s attorney gained an order from the court for her to remain in Washington until the case was settled, and she worked for wages for 18 months for Martin Van Buren, Clay&#x27;s successor as secretary of state. The case embarrassed Clay politically and personally, but he ultimately prevailed in court. After winning the case, Clay sent Dupuy to New Orleans, causing her to be away from her own family, but he later freed Dupuy and two of her children. Aaron Dupuy, Charlotte&#x27;s husband, was ordered by Clay to be whipped, at the behest of Clay&#x27;s wife, Lucretia. Dupuy&#x27;s infraction was a late return as Lucretia&#x27;s carriage driver. The overseer attempted the whipping, but Dupuy managed to wrest the whip away and began beating the overseer. He was not freed at the time of Clay&#x27;s death, but became freed after the Civil War. Clay himself wrote, &quot;here in Kentucky slavery is in its most mitigated form, still it is slavery.&quot; Clay&#x27;s will provided for the gradual emancipation of the slaves he held at the time of his death in 1852. Aaron Dupuy was an exception. Clay also stipulated that several of those slaves were bequeathed to his son, John.

===Historical reputation===

Clay&#x27;s Whig Party collapsed four years after his death, but Clay cast a long shadow over the generation of political leaders that presided over the Civil War. Mississippi Senator Henry S. Foote stated his opinion that &quot;had there been one such man in the Congress of the United States as Henry Clay in 1860–1861 there would, I feel sure, have been no civil war&quot;. Clay&#x27;s protege and fellow Kentuckian John J. Crittenden attempted to keep the Union together with the formation of the Constitutional Union Party and the proposed Crittenden Compromise. Though Crittenden&#x27;s efforts were unsuccessful, Kentucky remained in the Union during the Civil War, reflecting in part Clay&#x27;s continuing influence. Abraham Lincoln was a great admirer of Clay, saying he was &quot;my ideal of a great man&quot;. Lincoln wholeheartedly supported Clay&#x27;s economic programs; prior to the Civil War, he also held similar stances about slavery and the Union. Some historians have argued that a Clay victory in the 1844 election would have prevented both the Mexican-American War and the American Civil War.
Clay is generally regarded as one of the important political figures of his era. Most historians and political scientists consider Clay to be one of the most influential speakers of the house in U.S. history. In 1957, a Senate Committee selected Clay as one of the five greatest U.S. senators, along with Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun, Robert La Follette, and Robert A. Taft. A 1986 survey of historians ranked Clay as the greatest senator in U.S. history, while a 2006 survey of historians ranked Clay as the 31st-most influential American of all time. A 1998 poll of historians ranked Clay as the most qualified unsuccessful major party presidential nominee in U.S. history. In 2015, political scientist Michael G. Miller and historian Ken Owen ranked Clay as one of the four most influential American politicians who never served as president, alongside Alexander Hamilton, William Jennings Bryan, and Calhoun. Noting Clay&#x27;s influence over the United States in the last three decades of his life, biographer James Klotter writes that &quot;perhaps posterity should no longer call it the Jacksonian Era ... and instead term it the Clay Era.&quot;

===Monuments and memorials===

Many monuments, memorials, and even high schools have been erected and named in honor of Clay. Sixteen counties, one each in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia, are named for Clay. Communities named for Clay include Clay, Kentucky, Claysville, Alabama and Claysville, Pennsylvania. The United States Navy named a submarine, the , in his honor. Several statues honor Clay, including the Henry Clay Monument in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, and one of Kentucky&#x27;s two statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection. Clay&#x27;s estate of Ashland is a National Historic Landmark. The Decatur House, Clay&#x27;s home in Washington, D.C. during his tenure as secretary of state, is also a National Historic Landmark. Due to his involvement in the American Colonization Society, a town in the newly formed Liberia in West Africa was named Clay-Ashland after Henry Clay and to where the freed slaves from Kentucky emigrated. Clay is also one of the &quot;famous five&quot; senators honored with their portraits in the Senate Reception Room.

<doc id="47621" wikidata="Q228642" url="?curid=47621" title="Isabella of France">
<text>Isabella of France ( – 22 August 1358), sometimes described as the She-Wolf of France (), was Queen of England as the wife of King Edward II, and &quot;de facto&quot; regent of England from 1327 until 1330. She was the youngest surviving child and only surviving daughter of King Philip IV of France and Joan I of Navarre. Isabella was notable in her lifetime for her diplomatic skills, intelligence, and beauty. She overthrew her husband, becoming a &quot;femme fatale&quot; figure in plays and literature over the years, usually portrayed as a beautiful but cruel and manipulative figure.

Isabella arrived in England at age 12 during a period of growing conflict between the king and the powerful baronial factions. Her new husband was notorious for the patronage he lavished on his favourite, Piers Gaveston, but the queen supported Edward during these early years, forming a working relationship with Piers and using her relationship with the French monarchy to bolster her own authority and power. After the death of Gaveston at the hands of the barons in 1312, however, Edward turned to a new favourite, Hugh Despenser the Younger, and attempted to take revenge on the barons, resulting in the Despenser War and a period of internal repression across England. Isabella could not tolerate Hugh Despenser, and by 1325, her marriage to Edward was at a breaking point.

Travelling to France on a diplomatic mission, Isabella may have begun an affair with Roger Mortimer, and the two may possibly have agreed at this point to depose Edward and oust the Despenser family. The Queen returned to England with a small mercenary army in 1326, moving rapidly across England. The King&#x27;s forces deserted him. Isabella deposed Edward, becoming regent on behalf of her young son, Edward III. Some believe that Isabella then arranged the murder of Edward II. Isabella and Mortimer&#x27;s regime began to crumble, partly because of her lavish spending, but also because the Queen successfully, but unpopularly, resolved long-running problems such as the war with Scotland.

In 1330, aged 18, Isabella&#x27;s son, Edward III forcibly asserted his authority. Mortimer was executed, Isabella&#x27;s regency was ended and she was imprisoned, but soon released. She lived out her remaining years as a wealthy courtier and grew close again to her family especially her daughter Joan, Queen of Scots and her grandson Edward, Prince of Wales.

== Early life and marriage: 1295–1308 ==
Isabella was born in Paris on an uncertain date — on the basis of the chroniclers and the eventual date of her marriage, she was probably born between April 1295 and January 1296. She is described as born in 1292 in the Annals of Wigmore, and Piers Langtoft agrees, claiming that she was 7 years old in 1299. The French chronicler Guillaume de Nangis and English chronicler Thomas Walsingham describe her as 12 years old at the time of her marriage in January 1308, placing her birth between January 1295 and of 1296. A papal dispensation by Clement V in November 1305 permitted her immediate marriage by proxy, despite the fact that she was probably only 10 years old. Since her brother Charles was born on 18 June 1294, and she had to reach the canonical age of 12 before her marriage in January 1308, the evidence suggests that she was born between April 1295 and January 1296. Her parents were King Philip IV of France and Queen Joan I of Navarre; her brothers Louis, Philip and Charles became kings of France.

Isabella was born into a royal family that ruled the most powerful state in Western Europe. Her father, King Philip, known as &quot;le Bel&quot; (the Fair) because of his good looks, was a strangely unemotional man; one contemporary described him as &quot;neither a man nor a beast, but a statue&quot;; modern historians have noted that he &quot;cultivated a reputation for Christian kingship and showed few weaknesses of the flesh&quot;. Philip built up centralised royal power in France, engaging in a sequence of conflicts to expand or consolidate French authority across the region, but remained chronically short of money throughout his reign. Indeed, he appeared almost obsessed about building up wealth and lands, something that his daughter was also accused of in later life. Isabella&#x27;s mother died when Isabella was still quite young; some contemporaries suspected Philip IV of her murder, albeit probably incorrectly.

Isabella was brought up in and around the Louvre Palace and the Palais de la Cité in Paris. Isabella was cared for by Théophania de Saint-Pierre, her nurse, given a good education and taught to read, developing a love of books. As was customary for the period, all of Philip&#x27;s children were married young for political benefit. Isabella was promised in marriage by her father to Edward II, the son of King Edward I of England, with the intention to resolve the conflicts between France and England over the latter&#x27;s continental possession of Gascony and claims to Anjou, Normandy and Aquitaine. Pope Boniface VIII had urged the marriage as early as 1298 but it was delayed by wrangling over the terms of the marriage contract. The renewal of the Anglo-French truce in 1299 led to the marriage of Edward I to Philip&#x27;s sister Margaret, further anticipating the marriage of Isabella to Edward II. In 1303, Edward I may have considered a Castilian bride for Edward II instead of Isabella and even increased her dowry before the wedding. Edward I attempted to break the engagement several times for political advantage, and only after he died in 1307 did the wedding proceed.

Isabella and Edward II were finally married at Boulogne-sur-Mer on 25 January 1308. Isabella&#x27;s wardrobe gives some indications of her wealth and style — she had dresses of baudekyn, velvet, taffeta and cloth, along with numerous furs; she had over 72 headdresses and coifs; she brought with her two gold crowns, gold and silver dinnerware and 419 yards of linen. At the time of her marriage, Isabella was probably about twelve and was described by Geoffrey of Paris as &quot;the beauty of beauties... in the kingdom if not in all Europe.&quot; This description was probably not simply flattery by a chronicler, since both Isabella&#x27;s father and brothers were considered very handsome men by contemporaries, and her husband was to nickname her &quot;Isabella the Fair&quot;. Isabella was said to resemble her father, and not her mother, queen regnant of Navarre, a plump, plain woman. This indicates that Isabella was slender and pale-skinned, although the fashion at the time was for blonde, slightly full-faced women, and Isabella may well have followed this stereotype instead. Throughout her career, Isabella was noted as charming and diplomatic, with a particular skill at convincing people to follow her courses of action. Unusual for the medieval period, contemporaries also commented on her high intelligence.

== Queenship ==
As queen, the young Isabella faced numerous challenges. Edward was handsome, but also to have possibly formed close romantic attachments first to Piers Gaveston and then to Hugh Despenser the Younger. Edward found himself at odds with the barons, too, in particular his first cousin Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, whilst continuing the war against the Scots that he had inherited from Edward I. Using her own supporters at court and the patronage of her French family, Isabella attempted to find a political path through these challenges. She successfully formed an alliance with Gaveston, but after his death at the hands of the barons, her position grew increasingly precarious. Edward began to take revenge on his enemies, using an ever more brutal alliance with the Despenser family, in particular his new favourite, Hugh Despenser the Younger. By 1326, Isabella found herself increasingly at odds with both Edward and Hugh, ultimately resulting in Isabella&#x27;s own bid for power and an invasion of England.

=== Fall of Gaveston: 1308–1312 ===
Edward was an unusual character by medieval standards. Edward looked the part of a Plantagenet king: he was tall, athletic, and wildly popular at the beginning of his reign. However, he rejected most of the traditional pursuits of a king for the period — jousting, hunting and warfare — and instead enjoyed music, poetry and rural crafts. Furthermore, there is the question of Edward&#x27;s sexuality in a period when homosexuality was considered a serious crime, but there is no direct evidence of his sexual orientation. Contemporary chroniclers made much of his close affinity with a succession of male favourites. Some condemned Edward for loving them &quot;beyond measure&quot; and &quot;uniquely&quot;, others explicitly referring to an &quot;illicit and sinful union&quot;. Nonetheless, Isabella bore four children by Edward, leading some historians to believe that Edward&#x27;s affairs with his male favourites were platonic, despite Isabella&#x27;s complaints of whose bed he visited.

When Isabella first arrived in England following her marriage, her husband was already involved with Piers Gaveston, an &quot;arrogant, ostentatious&quot; soldier, with a &quot;reckless and headstrong&quot; personality that appealed to Edward. Isabella, then aged twelve, was effectively sidelined by the pair. Edward chose to sit with Gaveston rather than Isabella at their wedding celebration, causing grave offence to her uncles Louis, Count of Évreux, and Charles, Count of Valois, and then refused to grant her either her own lands or her own household. Edward also gave Gaveston Isabella&#x27;s own jewelry, which he wore publicly. Isabella complained to her father that Gaveston took her place next to Edward II, she received insufficient funds and Edward visited Gaveston&#x27;s bed more than hers. It took the intervention of Isabella&#x27;s father, Philip IV before Edward began to provide for her more appropriately.

Isabella&#x27;s relationship with Gaveston was complex. For a time, her dislike of him was widely known, and she was said to be in contact with her father, the pope and cardinals in order to have him exiled. Baronial opposition to Gaveston, championed by Thomas of Lancaster, increased; and Philip IV began to covertly fund this grouping, using Isabella and her household as intermediaries. Edward was forced to exile Gaveston to Ireland for a period and began to show Isabella much greater respect, assigning her lands and patronage. In turn, Philip ceased his support for the barons. Gaveston eventually returned from Ireland, and by 1309–11, the three seemed to be co-existing together relatively comfortably. Indeed, Gaveston&#x27;s key enemy, Edward and Isabella&#x27;s uncle Thomas of Lancaster, considered her to be an ally of Gaveston. Isabella had begun to build up her own supporters at court, principally the Beaumont family, itself opposed to the Lancastrians. Similarly originating from France, the senior member of the Beaumont family, Isabella de Beaumont, had been a close confidant of Edward&#x27;s mother Eleanor of Castile, supported by her brother Henry de Beaumont.

In 1311, Edward conducted a failed campaign against the Scots, during which he and Isabella barely escaped capture. In the aftermath, the barons rose up, signing the Ordinances of 1311, which promised action against Gaveston and expelled Isabella and Henry de Beaumont from court. England fully descended into civil war in 1312. Isabella stood with Edward, sending angry letters to her uncles Louis and Charles asking for support. Edward left Isabella against her will at Tynemouth Priory in Northumberland whilst he unsuccessfully attempted to fight the barons. The campaign was a disaster, and although Edward escaped, Gaveston found himself stranded at Scarborough Castle where his baronial enemies then surrounded and captured him. Guy de Beauchamp and Thomas of Lancaster ensured Gaveston&#x27;s execution as he was being taken south to rejoin Edward.

=== Tensions grow: 1312–1321 ===
Tensions mounted steadily over the decade. In 1312, Isabella gave birth to the future Edward III, but by the end of the year Edward&#x27;s court was beginning to change. Edward was still relying heavily upon his French in-laws, one of which was Isabella&#x27;s uncle Louis who had been sent from Paris to assist him. However, Hugh Despenser the Elder now formed part of the inner circle, marking the beginning of the Despensers&#x27; increased prominence at Edward&#x27;s court. The Despensers were opposed to both the Lancastrians and their other allies in the Welsh Marches, making an easy alliance with Edward, who sought revenge for the death of Gaveston.

In 1313, Isabella travelled to Paris with Edward to garner further French support, which resulted in the Tour de Nesle affair. The journey was a pleasant one, with many festivities, although Isabella was injured when her tent burned down. During the visit, her brothers Louis and Charles put on a satirical puppet show for their guests and Isabella gave new embroidered purses both to her brothers and to their wives. Isabella and Edward then returned to England with new assurances of French support against the English barons. Later in the year, however, when Isabella and Edward held a large dinner in London to celebrate their return, Isabella apparently noticed that the purses she had given to her sisters-in-law were now being carried by two Norman knights: Gautier and Philippe d&#x27;Aunay. Isabella concluded that the pair must have been carrying on an illicit affair, and appears to have informed her father of this during her next visit to France in 1314. The consequence of this was the Tour de Nesle affair in Paris, which led to legal action against all three of Isabella&#x27;s sisters-in-law. Blanche and Margaret of Burgundy were imprisoned for life while Joan of Burgundy was imprisoned for a year before being acquitted. Isabella&#x27;s reputation in France suffered somewhat as a result of her perceived role in the affair.

In the north, however, the situation was becoming worse. Edward attempted to quash the Scots in a fresh campaign in 1314, resulting in the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn. Edward was blamed by the barons for the catastrophic failure of the campaign. Thomas of Lancaster reacted to the defeats in Scotland by taking increased power in England and turning against Isabella, cutting off funds and harassing her household. To make matters worse, the &quot;Great Famine&quot; descended on England during 1315–17, causing widespread loss of life and financial problems.

Despite Isabella giving birth to her second son, John, in 1316, Edward&#x27;s position was precarious. Indeed, John Deydras, a royal pretender, appeared in Oxford, claiming to have been switched with Edward at birth, and to be the real king of England himself. Given Edward&#x27;s unpopularity, the rumours spread considerably before Deydras&#x27; eventual execution, and appear to have greatly upset Isabella. Isabella responded by deepening her alliance with Lancaster&#x27;s enemy, Henry de Beaumont, and by taking up an increased role in government herself, including attending council meetings and acquiring increased lands. Henry&#x27;s sister, Isabella de Vesci, continued to remain a close adviser to the Queen. The Scottish general Sir James Douglas, war leader for Robert I of Scotland, made a bid to capture Isabella personally in 1319. He almost succeeded in capturing her at York, with Isabella only just barely escaping. Suspicions fell on Lancaster, and one of Edward&#x27;s knights, Edmund Darel, was arrested on charges of having betrayed her location, but the charges were essentially unproven. In 1320, Isabella accompanied Edward to France to try and convince her brother, Philip V, to provide fresh support to crush the English barons.

Meanwhile, Hugh de Despenser the Younger became an increasing favourite of Isabella&#x27;s husband, and was believed by some to have begun a sexual relationship with him around this time. Hugh was the same age as Edward. His father, Hugh the Elder, had supported Edward and Gaveston a few years previously. The Despensers were bitter enemies of Lancaster, and, with Edward&#x27;s support, began to increase their power base in the Welsh Marches, in the process making enemies of Roger Mortimer de Chirk and his nephew, Roger Mortimer of Wigmore, their rival Marcher Lords. Whilst Isabella had been able to work with Gaveston, Edward&#x27;s previous favourite, it became increasingly clear that Hugh the Younger and Isabella could not work out a similar compromise. Unfortunately for Isabella, she was still estranged from Lancaster&#x27;s rival faction, giving her little room to manoeuvre. In 1321, Lancaster&#x27;s alliance moved against the Despensers, sending troops into London and demanding their exile. Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, a moderate baron with strong French links, asked Isabella to intervene in an attempt to prevent war; Isabella publicly went down on her knees to appeal to Edward to exile the Despensers, providing him with a face-saving excuse to do so, but Edward intended to arrange their return at the first opportunity. Isabella&#x27;s attempts, though heavily praised by the English, had very little impact and she had no lasting effect as a mediator for foreign or domestic affairs.

=== Return of the Despensers, 1321–1326 ===
Despite the momentary respite delivered by Isabella, by the autumn of 1321, the tensions between the two factions of Edward, Isabella and the Despenser, opposing the baronial opposition led by Thomas of Lancaster, were extremely high, with forces still mobilised across the country. At this point, Isabella undertook a pilgrimage to Canterbury, during which she left the traditional route to stop at Leeds Castle in Kent, a fortification held by Bartholomew de Badlesmere, steward of the King&#x27;s household who had by 1321 joined the ranks of Edward&#x27;s opponents. Some historians believe that the pilgrimage was a deliberate act by Isabella on Edward&#x27;s behalf to create a &quot;casus belli&quot;. Lord Badlesmere was away at the time, having left his wife Margaret de Clare, Baroness Badlesmere in charge of the castle. When the latter adamantly refused the Queen&#x27;s admittance, fighting broke out outside the castle between Isabella&#x27;s guards and the garrison, marking the beginning of the Despenser War. Whilst Edward mobilised his own faction and placed Leeds Castle under siege, Isabella was given the Great Seal and assumed control of the royal Chancery from the Tower of London. After surrendering to Edward&#x27;s forces on 31 October 1321, Margaret, Baroness Badlesmere, Kent and her children were sent to the Tower, and 13 of the Leeds garrison were hanged. By January 1322, Edward&#x27;s army, reinforced by the Despensers returning from exile, had forced the surrender of the Mortimers, and by March Lancaster himself had been captured after the Battle of Boroughbridge; Lancaster was promptly executed, leaving Edward and the Despensers victorious.

Hugh Despenser the Younger was now firmly ensconced as Edward&#x27;s new favourite and together over the next four years Edward and the Despensers imposed a harsh rule over England, a &quot;sweeping revenge&quot; characterised by land confiscation, large-scale imprisonment, executions and the punishment of extended family members, including women and the elderly. This was condemned by contemporary chroniclers, and is felt to have caused concern to Isabella as well; some of those widows being persecuted included her friends. Isabella&#x27;s relationship with Despenser the Younger continued to deteriorate; the Despensers refused to pay her monies owed to her, or return her castles at Marlborough and Devizes. Indeed, various authors have suggested that there is evidence that Hugh Despenser the Younger attempted to assault Isabella herself in some fashion. Certainly, immediately after the Battle of Boroughbridge, Edward began to be markedly less generous in his gifts towards Isabella, and none of the spoils of the war were awarded to her. Worse still, later in the year Isabella was caught up in the failure of another of Edward&#x27;s campaigns in Scotland, in a way that permanently poisoned her relationship with both Edward and the Despensers.

Isabella and Edward had travelled north together at the start of the autumn campaign. Before the disastrous Battle of Old Byland in Yorkshire, Edward had ridden south, apparently to raise more men, sending Isabella east to Tynemouth Priory. With the Scottish army marching south, Isabella expressed considerable concern about her personal safety and requested assistance from Edward. Her husband initially proposed sending Despenser forces to secure her, but Isabella rejected this outright, instead requesting friendly troops. Rapidly retreating south with the Despensers, Edward failed to grasp the situation, resulting in Isabella finding herself and her household cut off from the south by the Scottish army, with the coastline patrolled by Flemish naval forces allied to the Scots. The situation was precarious and Isabella was forced to use a group of squires from her personal retinue to hold off the advancing army whilst other of her knights commandeered a ship. The fighting continued as Isabella and her household retreated onto the vessel, resulting in the death of two of her ladies-in-waiting. Once aboard, Isabella evaded the Flemish navy, landing further south and making her way to York. Isabella was furious both with Edward for, from her perspective, abandoning her to the Scots, and with Despensers for convincing Edward to retreat rather than sending help. For his part, Edward blamed Lewis de Beaumont, the Bishop of Durham and an ally of Isabella, for the fiasco.

Isabella effectively separated from Edward from here onwards, leaving him to live with Hugh Despenser. At the end of 1322, Isabella left the court on a ten-month-long pilgrimage around England by herself. On her return in 1323, she visited Edward briefly, but was removed from the process of granting royal patronage. At the end of 1324, as tensions grew with France, Edward and the Despensers confiscated all of Isabella&#x27;s lands, took over the running of her household and arrested and imprisoned all of her French staff. Isabella&#x27;s youngest children were removed from her and placed into the custody of the Despensers. At this point, Isabella appeared to have realised that any hope of working with Edward was effectively over and begun to consider radical solutions.

== Invasion of England ==
By 1325, Isabella was facing increasing pressure from Hugh Despenser the Younger, Edward&#x27;s new royal favourite. With her lands in England seized, her children taken away from her and her household staff arrested, Isabella began to pursue other options. When her brother, King Charles IV of France, seized Edward&#x27;s French possessions in 1325, she returned to France, initially as a delegate of the King charged with negotiating a peace treaty between the two nations. However, her presence in France became a focal point for the many nobles opposed to Edward&#x27;s reign. Isabella gathered an army to oppose Edward, in alliance with Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, whom she may have taken as a lover. Isabella and Mortimer returned to England with a mercenary army, seizing the country in a lightning campaign. The Despensers were executed and Edward was forced to abdicate — his eventual fate and possible murder remains a matter of considerable historical debate. Isabella ruled as regent until 1330 when her son Edward deposed Mortimer and began to rule directly in his own right.

=== Tensions in Gascony, 1323–1325 ===
Isabella&#x27;s husband Edward, as the Duke of Aquitaine, owed homage to the King of France for his lands in Gascony. Isabella&#x27;s three brothers each had only short reigns, and Edward had successfully avoided paying homage to Louis X, and had paid homage to Philip V only under great pressure. Once Charles IV took up the throne, Edward had attempted to avoid doing so again, increasing tensions between the two. One of the elements in the disputes was the border province of Agenais, part of Gascony and in turn part of Aquitaine. Tensions rose in November 1323 after the construction of a bastide, a type of fortified town, in Saint-Sardos, part of the Agenais, by a French vassal. Gascon forces destroyed the bastide, and in turn Charles attacked the English-held Montpezat. The assault was unsuccessful, but in the subsequent War of Saint-Sardos, Isabella&#x27;s uncle, Charles of Valois, successfully wrested Aquitaine from English control. By 1324, Charles declared Edward&#x27;s lands forfeit and occupied the entirety of Aquitaine apart from the coastal areas.

Edward was still unwilling to travel to France to give homage due to England&#x27;s precarious condition. Criminal gangs were occupying most of the country and there had been an assassination plot against Edward and Hugh Despenser in 1324, with the famous magician John of Nottingham being hired to kill the pair using necromancy. Edward was deeply concerned that, should he leave England, even for a short while, the barons would take the chance to rise up and take their revenge on the Despensers. Charles sent a message through Pope John XXII to Edward, suggesting that he was willing to reverse the forfeiture of the lands if Edward ceded the Agenais and paid homage for the rest of the lands. The Pope proposed Isabella as an ambassador, and Isabella saw this as a perfect opportunity to resolve her situation with Edward and the Despensers.

Having promised to return to England by the summer, Isabella reached Paris in March 1325 and rapidly agreed to a truce in Gascony, under which Prince Edward, then thirteen years old, would come to France to give homage on his father&#x27;s behalf. Prince Edward arrived in France, and gave homage in September. At this point, however, rather than returning, Isabella remained firmly in France with her son. Edward began to send urgent messages to the Pope and to Charles IV, expressing his concern about his wife&#x27;s absence, but to no avail. Edward instructed Isabella to come home in September, but she expressed concern the young Despenser would try to kill her upon her arrival, or the Earl of Richmond. She also feared her own husband might attempt to have her killed. For his part, Charles replied that the, &quot;queen has come of her own will and may freely return if she wishes. But if she prefers to remain here, she is my sister and I refuse to expel her.&quot; Charles went on to refuse to return the lands in Aquitaine to Edward, resulting in a provisional agreement under which Edward resumed administration of the remaining English territories in early 1326 whilst France continued to occupy the rest.

Meanwhile, the messages brought back by Edward&#x27;s agent Walter de Stapledon, Bishop of Exeter and others portrayed a steadily worsening situation. They wrote that Isabella had publicly snubbed Stapledon; Edward&#x27;s political enemies were gathering at the French court and threatening his emissaries; and that Isabella was dressed as a widow, claiming that Hugh Despenser had destroyed her marriage with Edward. Additionally, Isabella surrounded herself with mostly exiles, including Edmund of Kent, John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond, and her rumored lover Roger Mortimer.

=== Roger Mortimer, 1325–1326 ===
Roger Mortimer was a powerful Marcher lord, married to the wealthy heiress Joan de Geneville, and the father of twelve children. Mortimer had been imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1322 following his capture by Edward during the Despenser wars. Mortimer&#x27;s uncle, Roger Mortimer de Chirk finally died in prison, but Mortimer managed to escape the Tower in August 1323: making a hole in the stone wall of his cell and then escaping onto the roof, before using rope ladders provided by an accomplice to get down to the River Thames. He then crossed the river and eventually made it to safety in France. Victorian writers suggested that, given later events, Isabella might have helped Mortimer escape. Additionally, some historians continue to argue that their relationship had already begun at this point, although most believe that there is no hard evidence for their having had a substantial relationship before meeting in Paris.

Isabella was reintroduced to Mortimer in Paris by her cousin, Joan, Countess of Hainault, who appears to have approached Isabella suggesting a marital alliance between their two families, marrying Prince Edward to Joan&#x27;s daughter, Philippa. Mortimer and Isabella may have begun a physical relationship from December 1325 onwards. If so, both Isabella and Mortimer were taking a huge risk in doing so. Female infidelity was a very serious offence in medieval Europe, as shown during the Tour de Nesle Affair. Both of Isabella&#x27;s former French sisters-in-law had died by 1326 as a result of their imprisonment for charges of adultery, and their alleged lovers had been brutally executed. As a result, Isabella&#x27;s motivation has been the subject of discussion by historians. Some believe that there was a strong sexual attraction between the two, that they shared an interest in the Arthurian legends, and that they both enjoyed fine art and high living. One historian has described their relationship as one of the &quot;great romances of the Middle Ages&quot; in spite of the fact that they are reputed to have murdered her husband. They also shared a common enemy: the regime of Edward II and the Despensers.

Taking Prince Edward with them, Isabella and Mortimer left the French court in mid-1326 and travelled north to William I, Count of Hainaut. As Joan had suggested the previous year, Isabella betrothed Prince Edward to Philippa of Hainault, the daughter of the Count, in exchange for a substantial dowry. She then used this money, plus an earlier loan from Charles, to raise a mercenary army, scouring Brabant for men, which were added to a small force of Hainaut troops. William also provided eight men-of-war ships and various smaller vessels as part of the marriage arrangements. Although Edward was now fearing an invasion, secrecy remained key, and Isabella convinced William to detain envoys from Edward. Isabella also appears to have made a secret agreement with the Scots for the duration of the forthcoming campaign. On 22 September, Isabella, Mortimer and their modest force set sail for England.

=== Seizure of power, 1326 ===

Having evaded Edward&#x27;s fleet, which had been sent to intercept them, Isabella and Mortimer landed at Orwell on the east coast of England on 24 September with a small force; estimates of Isabella&#x27;s army vary from between 300 and around 2,000 soldiers, with 1,500 being a popular middle figure. After a short period of confusion during which they attempted to work out where they had actually landed, Isabella moved quickly inland, dressed in her widow&#x27;s clothes. The local levies mobilised to stop them immediately changed sides, and by the following day Isabella was in Bury St Edmunds and shortly afterwards had swept inland to Cambridge. Thomas, Earl of Norfolk, joined Isabella&#x27;s forces and Henry of Lancaster – the brother of the late Thomas, and Isabella&#x27;s uncle – also announced he was joining Isabella&#x27;s faction, marching south to join her.

By the 27th, word of the invasion had reached the King and the Despensers in London. Edward issued orders to local sheriffs to mobilise opposition to Isabella and Mortimer, but London itself was becoming unsafe because of local unrest and Edward made plans to leave. Isabella struck west again, reaching Oxford on 2 October where she was &quot;greeted as a saviour&quot; – Adam Orleton, the Bishop of Hereford, emerged from hiding to give a lecture to the university on the evils of the Despensers. Edward fled London on the same day, heading west towards Wales. Isabella and Mortimer now had an effective alliance with the Lancastrian opposition to Edward, bringing all of his opponents into a single coalition.

Isabella now marched south towards London, pausing at Dunstable, outside the city on 7 October. London was now in the hands of the mobs, although broadly allied to Isabella. Bishop Stapledon failed to realise the extent to which royal power had collapsed in the capital, and tried to intervene militarily to protect his property against rioters; a hated figure locally, he was promptly attacked and killed — his head was later sent to Isabella by her local supporters. Edward, meanwhile, was still fleeing west, reaching Gloucester by 9 October. Isabella responded by marching swiftly west herself in an attempt to cut him off, reaching Gloucester a week after Edward, who slipped across the border into Wales the same day.

Hugh Despenser the Elder continued to hold Bristol against Isabella and Mortimer, who placed it under siege between 18–26 October; when it fell, Isabella was able to recover her daughters Eleanor and Joan, who had been kept in the Despensers&#x27; custody. By now desperate and increasingly deserted by their court, Edward and Hugh Despenser the Younger attempted to sail to Lundy, a small island in the Bristol Channel, but the weather was against them and after several days they were forced to land back in Wales. With Bristol secure, Isabella moved her base of operations up to the border town of Hereford, from where she ordered Henry of Lancaster to locate and arrest her husband. After a fortnight of evading Isabella&#x27;s forces in South Wales, Edward and Hugh were finally caught and arrested near Llantrisant on 16 November.

The retribution began immediately. Hugh Despenser the Elder had been captured at Bristol, and despite some attempts by Isabella to protect him, was promptly executed by his Lancastrian enemies – his body was hacked to pieces and fed to the local dogs. The remainder of the former regime were brought to Isabella. Edmund Fitzalan, a key supporter of Edward II and who had received many of Mortimer&#x27;s confiscated lands in 1322, was executed on 17 November. Hugh Despenser the Younger was sentenced to be brutally executed on 24 November, and a huge crowd gathered in anticipation at seeing him die. They dragged him from his horse, stripped him, and scrawled Biblical verses against corruption and arrogance on his skin. He was then dragged into the city, presented to Queen Isabella, Roger Mortimer and the Lancastrians. Despenser was then condemned to hang as a thief, be castrated, and then to be drawn and quartered as a traitor, his quarters to be dispersed throughout England. Simon of Reading, one of the Despensers&#x27; supporters, was hanged next to him, on charges of insulting Isabella. Once the core of the Despenser regime had been executed, Isabella and Mortimer began to show restraint. Lesser nobles were pardoned and the clerks at the heart of the government, mostly appointed by the Despensers and Stapledon, were confirmed in office. All that was left now was the question of Edward II, still officially Isabella&#x27;s legal husband and lawful king.

=== Death of Edward, 1327 ===
As an interim measure, Edward II was held in the custody of Henry of Lancaster, who surrendered Edward&#x27;s Great Seal to Isabella. The situation remained tense, however; Isabella was clearly concerned about Edward&#x27;s supporters staging a counter-coup, and in November she seized the Tower of London, appointed one of her supporters as mayor and convened a council of nobles and churchmen in Wallingford to discuss the fate of Edward. The council concluded that Edward would be legally deposed and placed under house arrest for the rest of his life. This was then confirmed at the next parliament, dominated by Isabella and Mortimer&#x27;s followers. The session was held in January 1327, with Isabella&#x27;s case being led by her supporter Adam Orleton, Bishop of Hereford. Isabella&#x27;s son, Prince Edward, was confirmed as Edward III of England, with his mother appointed regent. Isabella&#x27;s position was still precarious, as the legal basis for deposing Edward was doubtful and many lawyers of the day maintained that Edward II was still the rightful king, regardless of the declaration of the Parliament. The situation could be reversed at any moment and Edward II was known to be a vengeful ruler.

Edward II&#x27;s subsequent fate, and Isabella&#x27;s role in it, remains hotly contested by historians. The minimally agreed version of events is that Isabella and Mortimer had Edward moved from Kenilworth Castle in the Midlands to the safer location of Berkeley Castle in the Welsh borders, where he was put into the custody of Lord Berkeley. On 23 September, Isabella and Edward III were informed by messenger that Edward had died whilst imprisoned at the castle, because of a &quot;fatal accident&quot;. Edward&#x27;s body was apparently buried at Gloucester Cathedral, with his heart being given in a casket to Isabella. After the funeral, there were rumours for many years that Edward had survived and was really alive somewhere in Europe, some of which were captured in the famous Fieschi Letter written in the 1340s, although no concrete evidence ever emerged to support the allegations. There are, however, various historical interpretations of the events surrounding this basic sequence of events.

According to legend, Isabella and Mortimer famously plotted to murder Edward in such a way as not to draw blame on themselves, sending a famous order (in ) which, depending on where the comma was inserted, could mean either &quot;Do not be afraid to kill Edward; it is good&quot; or &quot;Do not kill Edward; it is good to fear&quot;. In actuality, there is little evidence of anyone deciding to have Edward assassinated, and none whatsoever of the note having been written. Similarly, accounts of Edward being killed with a red-hot poker have no strong contemporary sources to support them. The conventional 20th-century view has been that Edward did die at Berkeley Castle, either murdered on Isabella&#x27;s orders or of ill-health brought on by his captivity, and that subsequent accounts of his survival were simply rumours, similar to those that surrounded Joan of Arc and other near contemporaries after their deaths.

Three recent historians, however, have offered an alternative interpretation of events. Paul Doherty, drawing extensively on the Fieschi Letter of the 1340s, has argued that Edward in fact escaped from Berkeley Castle with the help of William Ockle, a knight whom Doherty argues subsequently pretended to be Edward in disguise around Europe, using the name &quot;William the Welshman&quot; to draw attention away from the real Edward himself. In this interpretation, a look-alike was buried at Gloucester. Ian Mortimer, focusing more on contemporary documents from 1327 itself, argues that Roger de Mortimer engineered a fake &quot;escape&quot; for Edward from Berkeley Castle; after this Edward was kept in Ireland, believing he was really evading Mortimer, before finally finding himself free, but politically unwelcome, after the fall of Isabella and Mortimer. In this version, Edward makes his way to Europe, before subsequently being buried at Gloucester. Finally, Alison Weir, again drawing on the Fieschi Letter, has recently argued that Edward II escaped his captors, killing one in the process, and lived as a hermit for many years; in this interpretation, the body in Gloucester Cathedral is of Edward&#x27;s dead captor. In all of these versions, it is argued that it suited Isabella and Mortimer to publicly claim that Edward was dead, even if they were aware of the truth. Other historians, however, including David Carpenter, have criticised the methodology behind this revisionist approach and disagree with the conclusions.

== Later years ==
Isabella and Mortimer ruled together for four years, with Isabella&#x27;s period as regent marked by the acquisition of huge sums of money and land. When their political alliance with the Lancastrians began to disintegrate, Isabella continued to support Mortimer. Isabella fell from power when her son, Edward III deposed Mortimer in a coup, taking back royal authority for himself. Unlike Mortimer, Isabella survived the transition of power, remaining a wealthy and influential member of the English court, albeit never returning directly to active politics.

=== As regent, 1326–1330 ===
Isabella&#x27;s regency lasted only four years, before the fragile political alliance that had brought her and Mortimer to power disintegrated. 1328 saw the marriage of Isabella&#x27;s son, Edward III to Philippa of Hainault, as agreed before the invasion of 1326; the lavish ceremony was held in London to popular acclaim. Isabella and Mortimer had already begun a trend that continued over the next few years, in starting to accumulate huge wealth. With her lands restored to her, Isabella was already exceptionally rich, but she began to accumulate yet more. Within the first few weeks, Isabella had granted herself almost £12,000; finding that Edward&#x27;s royal treasury contained £60,000, a rapid period of celebratory spending then ensued. Isabella soon awarded herself another £20,000, allegedly to pay off foreign debts. At Edward III&#x27;s coronation, Isabella then extended her land holdings from a value of £4,400 each year to the huge sum of £13,333, making her one of the largest landowners in the kingdom. Isabella also refused to hand over her dower lands to Philippa after her marriage to Edward III, in contravention of usual custom. Isabella&#x27;s lavish lifestyle matched her new incomes. Mortimer, in effect her first minister, after a restrained beginning, also began to accumulate lands and titles at a tremendous rate, particularly in the Marcher territories.

The new regime also faced some key foreign policy dilemmas, which Isabella approached from a realist perspective. The first of these was the situation in Scotland, where Edward II&#x27;s unsuccessful policies had left an unfinished, tremendously expensive war. Isabella was committed to bringing this issue to a conclusion by diplomatic means. Edward III initially opposed this policy, before eventually relenting, leading to the Treaty of Northampton. Under this treaty, Isabella&#x27;s daughter Joan would marry David Bruce (heir apparent to the Scottish throne) and Edward III would renounce any claims on Scottish lands, in exchange for the promise of Scottish military aid against any enemy except the French, and £20,000 in compensation for the raids across northern England. No compensation would be given to those earls who had lost their Scottish estates, and the compensation would be taken by Isabella. Although strategically successful and, historically at least, &quot;a successful piece of policy making&quot;, Isabella&#x27;s Scottish policy was by no means popular and contributed to the general sense of discontent with the regime. Secondly, the Gascon situation, still unresolved from Edward II&#x27;s reign, also posed an issue. Isabella reopened negotiations in Paris, resulting in a peace treaty under which the bulk of Gascony, minus the Agenais, would be returned to England in exchange for a 50,000-mark penalty. The treaty was not popular in England because of the Agenais clause.

Henry, Earl of Lancaster was amongst the first to break with Isabella and Mortimer. By 1327 Lancaster was irritated by Mortimer&#x27;s behaviour and Isabella responded by beginning to sideline him from her government. Lancaster was furious over the passing of the Treaty of Northampton, and refused to attend court, mobilising support amongst the commoners of London. Isabella responded to the problems by undertaking a wide reform of royal administration and local law enforcement. In a move guaranteed to appeal to domestic opinion, Isabella also decided to pursue Edward III&#x27;s claim on the French throne, sending her advisers to France to demand official recognition of his claim. The French nobility were unimpressed and, since Isabella lacked the funds to begin any military campaign, she began to court the opinion of France&#x27;s neighbours, including proposing the marriage of her son John to the Castilian royal family.

By the end of 1328 the situation had descended into near civil war once again, with Lancaster mobilising his army against Isabella and Mortimer. In January 1329 Isabella&#x27;s forces under Mortimer&#x27;s command took Lancaster&#x27;s stronghold of Leicester, followed by Bedford; Isabella — wearing armour, and mounted on a warhorse — and Edward III marched rapidly north, resulting in Lancaster&#x27;s surrender. He escaped death but was subjected to a colossal fine, effectively crippling his power. Isabella was merciful to those who had aligned themselves with him, although some — such as her old supporter Henry de Beaumont, whose family had split from Isabella over the peace with Scotland, which had lost them huge land holdings in Scotland — fled to France.

Despite Lancaster&#x27;s defeat, however, discontent continued to grow. Edmund of Kent had sided with Isabella in 1326, but had since begun to question his decision and was edging back towards Edward II, his half-brother. Edmund of Kent was in conversations with other senior nobles questioning Isabella&#x27;s rule, including Henry de Beaumont and Isabella de Vesci. Edmund was finally involved in a conspiracy in 1330, allegedly to restore Edward II, who, he claimed, was still alive: Isabella and Mortimer broke up the conspiracy, arresting Edmund and other supporters—including Simon Mepeham, Archbishop of Canterbury. Edmund may have expected a pardon, possibly from Edward III, but Isabella was insistent on his execution. The execution itself was a fiasco after the executioner refused to attend and Edmund of Kent had to be killed by a local dung-collector, who had been himself sentenced to death and was pardoned as a bribe to undertake the beheading. Isabella de Vesci escaped punishment, despite having been closely involved in the plot.

=== Mortimer&#x27;s fall from power, 1330 ===
By mid-1330, Isabella and Mortimer&#x27;s regime was increasingly insecure, and Isabella&#x27;s son, Edward III, was growing frustrated at Mortimer&#x27;s grip on power. Various historians, with different levels of confidence, have also suggested that in late 1329 Isabella became pregnant. A child of Mortimer&#x27;s with royal blood would have proved both politically inconvenient for Isabella, and challenging to Edward&#x27;s own position.

Edward quietly assembled a body of support from the Church and selected nobles, whilst Isabella and Mortimer moved into Nottingham Castle for safety, surrounding themselves with loyal troops. In the autumn, Mortimer was investigating another plot against him, when he challenged a young noble, William Montagu, during an interrogation. Mortimer declared that his word had priority over the king&#x27;s, an alarming statement that Montagu reported back to Edward. Edward was convinced that this was the moment to act, and on 19 October, Montagu led a force of twenty-three armed men into the castle by a secret tunnel. Up in the keep, Isabella, Mortimer and other council members were discussing how to arrest Montagu, when Montagu and his men appeared. Fighting broke out on the stairs and Mortimer was overwhelmed in his chamber. Isabella threw herself at Edward&#x27;s feet, famously crying &quot;Fair son, have pity on gentle Mortimer!&quot; Lancastrian troops rapidly took the rest of the castle, leaving Edward in control of his own government for the first time.

Parliament was convened the next month, where Mortimer was put on trial for treason. Isabella was portrayed as an innocent bystander during the proceedings, and no mention of her sexual relationship with Mortimer was made public. Mortimer was executed at Tyburn, but Edward III showed leniency and he was not quartered or disembowelled.

=== In retirement, 1330–1358 ===
After the coup, Isabella was initially transferred to Berkhamsted Castle, and then held under house arrest at Windsor Castle until 1332, when she then moved back to her own Castle Rising in Norfolk. Agnes Strickland, a Victorian historian, argued that Isabella suffered from occasional fits of madness during this period but modern interpretations suggest, at worst, a nervous breakdown following the death of Mortimer. Isabella remained extremely wealthy; despite being required to surrender most of her lands after losing power, in 1331 she was reassigned a yearly income of £3000, which increased to £4000 by 1337. She lived an expensive lifestyle in Norfolk, including minstrels, huntsmen, grooms and other luxuries, and was soon travelling again around England. In 1348, there were suggestions that she might travel to Paris to take part in peace negotiations, but eventually this plan was quashed. She was involved in the talks with Charles II of Navarre in 1358.

As the years went by, Isabella became very close to her daughter Joan, especially after Joan left her unfaithful husband, King David II of Scotland, who was imprisoned by her brother in the Tower of London at the time where she visited him once. Joan nursed her just before she died. She doted on her grandchildren, including Edward the Black Prince. She became increasingly interested in religion as she grew older, visiting a number of shrines. She remained, however, a gregarious member of the court, receiving constant visitors; amongst them appear to have been her friend Marie de St Pol, Countess of Pembroke, and her cousin Henry of Grosmont, Duke of Lancaster. King Edward and his children often visited her as well. She remained interested in Arthurian legends and jewellery; in 1358 she appeared at the St George&#x27;s Day celebrations at Windsor wearing a dress made of silk, silver, 300 rubies, 1800 pearls and a circlet of gold. She may have developed an interest in astrology or geometry towards the end of her life, receiving various presents relating to these disciplines.

Isabella took the nun&#x27;s habit of the Poor Clares before she died on 22 August 1358 at Hertford Castle, and her body was returned to London for burial at the Franciscan church at Newgate, in a service overseen by Archbishop Simon Islip. She was buried in the mantle she had worn at her wedding and at her request, Edward&#x27;s heart, placed into a casket thirty years before, was interred with her. Isabella left the bulk of her property, including Castle Rising, to her favourite grandson, the Black Prince, with some personal effects being granted to her daughter Joan.

== Cultural depictions ==
=== Literature and theatre ===
Queen Isabella appeared with a major role in Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s play &quot;Edward II&quot; (c. 1592) and thereafter has been frequently used as a character in plays, books and films, often portrayed as beautiful but manipulative or wicked. Thomas Gray, the 18th-century poet, combined Marlowe&#x27;s depiction of Isabella with William Shakespeare&#x27;s description of Margaret of Anjou (the wife of Henry VI) as the &quot;She-Wolf of France&quot;, to produce the anti-French poem &quot;The Bard&quot; (1757), in which Isabella rips apart the bowels of Edward II with her &quot;unrelenting fangs&quot;. The &quot;She-Wolf&quot; epithet stuck, and Bertolt Brecht re-used it in &quot;The Life of Edward II of England&quot; (1923).

=== Film ===
In Derek Jarman&#x27;s film &quot;Edward II&quot; (1991), based on Marlowe&#x27;s play, Isabella is portrayed (by actress Tilda Swinton) as a &quot;femme fatale&quot; whose thwarted love for Edward causes her to turn against him and steal his throne. In contrast to the negative depictions, Mel Gibson&#x27;s film &quot;Braveheart&quot; (1995) portrays Isabella (played by the French actress Sophie Marceau) more sympathetically. In the film, an adult Isabella is fictionally depicted as having a romantic affair with the Scottish hero William Wallace. This version of the character takes significant artistic license from her real life counterpart. Additionally, Wallace is incorrectly suggested to be the father of her son, Edward III, despite Wallace&#x27;s death being many years before Edward&#x27;s birth.

== Issue ==
Edward and Isabella had four children, and she suffered at least one miscarriage. Their itineraries demonstrate that they were together nine months prior to the births of all four surviving offspring. Their children were:

# Edward III, born 1312;
# John of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall, born 1316;
# Eleanor of Woodstock, born 1318, married Reinoud II of Guelders;
# Joan of the Tower, born 1321, married David II of Scotland.

<doc id="47622" wikidata="Q428829" url="?curid=47622" title="Caernarfon">
<text>Caernarfon (; ) is a royal town, community and port in Gwynedd, Wales. It has a population of 9,852 (with Caeathro). It lies along the A487 road, on the eastern shore of the Menai Strait, opposite the island of Anglesey. The city of Bangor is to the north-east, while Snowdonia (Eryri) fringes Caernarfon to the east and south-east.

Abundant natural resources in and around the Menai Strait enabled human habitation in prehistoric Britain. The Ordovices, a Celtic tribe, lived in the region during the period known as Roman Britain. The Roman fort Segontium was established around AD 80 to subjugate the Ordovices during the Roman conquest of Britain. The Romans occupied the region until the end of Roman rule in Britain in 382, after which Caernarfon became part of the Kingdom of Gwynedd. In the late 11th century, William the Conqueror ordered the construction of a motte-and-bailey castle at Caernarfon as part of the Norman invasion of Wales. He was unsuccessful, and Wales remained independent until around 1283.

In the 13th century, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, ruler of Gwynedd, refused to pay homage to Edward I of England, prompting the English conquest of Gwynedd. This was followed by the construction of Caernarfon Castle, one of the largest and most imposing fortifications built by the English in Wales. In 1284, the English-style county of Caernarfonshire was established by the Statute of Rhuddlan; the same year, Caernarfon was made a borough, a county and market town, and the seat of English government in north Wales.

The ascent of the Welsh House of Tudor to the throne of England eased hostilities with the English and resulted in Caernarfon Castle falling into a state of disrepair. The town has flourished, leading to its status as a major tourist centre and seat of Gwynedd Council, with a thriving harbour and marina. Caernarfon has expanded beyond its medieval walls and experienced heavy suburbanisation. The community of Caernarfon&#x27;s population includes the highest percentage of Welsh-speaking citizens anywhere in Wales. The status of Royal Borough was granted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1963 and amended to Royal Town in 1974. The castle and town walls are part of a World Heritage Site described as the Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd.

== Toponymy ==
The town&#x27;s name consists of three elements: , , and . &quot;Caer&#x27; means &#x27;fortress&quot;, in this case either the Roman fort of Segontium, which lies on the outskirts of the modern town, or the Norman castle erected near the mouth of the Afon Seiont. &quot;Arfon&quot; means &quot;opposite Môn (Anglesey)&quot;, and the full name therefore means &quot;the fortress in the land opposite Anglesey&quot;.

The earlier British and Romano-British settlement at Segontium was named &#x27; (&quot;Fort Seiont&quot;) after the river. It was also known as &#x27; (&quot;Fortress of Constantine&quot;), after a belief that it was the capital of Gwynedd under Constantine, a supposed son of Saint Elen and the Emperor Magnus Maximus. Both names appear in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; traditionally ascribed to Nennius. A medieval romance about Maximus and Elen, &quot;Macsen&#x27;s Dream&quot;, calls her home &#x27; (&quot;Fort Seiontmouth&quot; or &quot;the fortress at the mouth of the Seiont&quot;) and other pre-conquest poets such as Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd used the name &#x27;. A 1221 charter by Llywelyn the Great to the canons of Penmon priory on Anglesey mentions &#x27;, and the Welsh chronicle mentions both &#x27; and &quot;&quot;.

The town and the county named after it were officially spelled &quot;Carnarvon&quot; until 1926. At a meeting on 10 November 1925 the borough council resolved to ask the county council to change the spelling to &quot;Caernarvon&quot;. The county council gave permission for the change of spelling for the name of the borough with effect from 14 January 1926, and at the same time decided to ask the government to also change the spelling of the county&#x27;s name to Caernarvon. The government confirmed the change in the spelling of the county&#x27;s name with effect from 1 July 1926.

The municipal borough was designated a royal borough in 1963. When the borough was abolished in 1974 the status of &quot;royal town&quot; was granted to the new community which succeeded it. The spelling of both borough and county remained &quot;Caernarvon&quot; until they were abolished in 1974. The spelling of the community&#x27;s name was changed from &quot;Caernarvon&quot; to &quot;Caernarfon&quot; with effect from 2 June 1975 by order of Arfon Borough Council.

==History==
Caernarfon contains a Roman fort, Segontium, and a Norman motte-and-bailey castle was built at the mouth of the River Seiont.

In 1283, King Edward I completed his conquest of Wales which he secured by a chain of castles and walled towns. The construction of a new stone Caernarfon Castle seems to have started as soon as the campaign had finished. Edward&#x27;s architect, James of St. George, may well have modelled the castle on the walls of Constantinople, possibly being aware of the town&#x27;s legendary associations. Edward&#x27;s fourth son, Edward of Caernarfon, later Edward II of England, was born at the castle in April 1284 and made Prince of Wales in 1301. A story recorded in the 16th century suggests that the new prince was offered to the native Welsh on the premise &quot;that [he] was borne in Wales and could speake never a word of English&quot;, however, there is no contemporary evidence to support this.

Caernarfon was constituted a borough in 1284 by a charter of Edward I. The charter, which was confirmed on a number of occasions, appointed the mayor of the borough Constable of the Castle ex officio.

In 1911, David Lloyd George, then Member of Parliament (MP) for Caernarfon boroughs, which included various towns from Llŷn to Conwy, agreed to the British Royal Family&#x27;s idea of holding the investiture of the Prince of Wales at Caernarfon Castle. The ceremony took place on 13 July, with the royal family visiting Wales, and the future Edward VIII was duly invested.

In 1955, Caernarfon was in the running for the title of Capital of Wales on historical grounds but the town&#x27;s campaign was heavily defeated in a ballot of Welsh local authorities, with 11 votes compared to Cardiff&#x27;s 136. Cardiff therefore became the Welsh capital.

On 1 July 1969, the investiture ceremony for Charles, Prince of Wales was again held at Caernarfon Castle. The ceremony went ahead without incident despite terrorist threats and protests, which culminated in the death of two members of Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru (Welsh Defence Movement), Alwyn Jones and George Taylor, who were killed when their bomb – intended for the railway line at Abergele in order to stop the British Royal Train – exploded prematurely. The bombing campaign (one in Abergele, two in Caernarfon and finally one on Llandudno Pier) was organised by the movement&#x27;s leader, John Jenkins. He was later arrested after a tip-off and was sentenced to ten years imprisonment.

In July 2019, Caernarfon hosted a rally for Welsh independence. The event, organised by AUOB (All Under One Banner) Cymru, included a march through the town centre. Organisers estimated that roughly 8,000 people joined the march on the town square; local authorities confirmed at least 5,000 attendees. The event featured a number of speakers including Hardeep Singh Kohli, Evra Rose, Dafydd Iwan, Lleuwen Steffan, Siôn Jobbins, Beth Angell, Gwion Hallam, Meleri Davies and Elfed Wyn Jones. Talks covered criticism of Brexit and Westminster with advocating Welsh Independence.

The history of Caernarfon, as an example where the rise and fall of different civilizations can be seen from one hilltop, is discussed in John Michael Greer&#x27;s book &quot;The Long Descent&quot;. He writes of Caernarfon: 

==Geography==
Caernarfon is situated on the southern bank of the Menai Strait facing the Isle of Anglesey. It is situated south-west of Bangor, north of Porthmadog and approximately west of Llanberis and Snowdonia National Park. The mouth of the River Seiont is in the town, creating a natural harbour where it flows into the Menai Strait. Caernarfon Castle stands at the mouth of the river. The A487 passes directly through Caernarfon, with Bangor to the north and Porthmadog to the south.

As the crow flies, the summit of Snowdon lies a little over to the southeast of the town centre.

==Economy==
Caernarfon&#x27;s historical prominence and landmarks have made it a major tourist centre. As a result, many of the local businesses cater for the tourist trade. Caernarfon has numerous guest houses, inns and pubs, hotels, restaurants and shops. The majority of shops in the town are located either in the centre of town around Pool Street and Castle Square (Y Maes), on Doc Fictoria (Victoria Dock) or in Cei Llechi (Slate Quay). A number of shops are also located within the Town Walls.

The majority of the retail and residential section of Doc Fictoria was opened in 2008. The retail and residential section of Doc Fictoria is built directly beside a Blue Flag beach marina. It contains numerous homes, bars and bistros, cafés and restaurants, an award-winning arts centre, a maritime museum and a range of shops and stores.

Pool Street and Castle Square contain a number of large, national retail shops and smaller independent stores. Pool Street is pedestrianised and serves as the town&#x27;s main shopping street. Castle Square, commonly referred to as the &#x27;Maes&#x27; by both Welsh and English speakers, is the market square of the town. A market is held every Saturday throughout the year and also on Mondays in the summer. The square was revamped at a cost of £2.4 million in 2009. However, since its revamp the square has caused controversy due to traffic and parking difficulties. During the revamp, it was decided to remove barriers between traffic and pedestrians creating a &#x27;shared space&#x27;, to force drivers to be more considerate of pedestrians and other vehicles. This is the first use of this kind of arrangement in Wales, but it has been described by councillor Bob Anderson as being &#x27;too ambiguous&#x27; for road users. Another controversy caused by the revamp of the Maes was that a historic old oak tree was taken down from outside the HSBC bank. When the Maes was re-opened in July 2009 by the local politician and Heritage Minister of Wales, Alun Ffred Jones AM, he said, &quot;the use of beautiful local slate is very prominent in the new Maes.&quot;

There are many old public houses serving the town, including The Four Alls, The Anglesey Arms Hotel, The Castle Hotel, The Crown, Morgan Lloyd, Pen Deitch and The Twthill Vaults. The oldest public house in Caernarfon is the Black Boy Inn, which remained in the same family for over 40 years until sold in 2003 to a local independent family business. The pub has stood inside Caernarfon&#x27;s Town Walls since the 16th century, and many people claim to have seen ghosts within the building.

In and around the Town Walls are numerous restaurants, public houses and inns, and guest houses and hostels.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Caernarfon, at community (town) and county level: Caernarfon Town Council (Cyngor Tref Caernarfon) and Gwynedd Council (Cyngor Gwynedd). The town council is based at the Institute Building on Pavilion Hill (Allt Pafiliwn). As a royal town, the town council is allowed to style itself Caernarfon Royal Town Council (Cyngor Tref Frenhinol Caernarfon), which names it has used in the past, but as at 2024 it does not do so on its website or in council minutes. Gwynedd Council also has its headquarters in the town at the Council Offices on Shirehall Street.

The Caernarfon parliamentary constituency was a former electoral area centred on Caernarfon. Caernarfon is now part of the constituency of Dwyfor Meirionnydd in the UK Parliament, and Arfon in the Senedd. The town is twinned with Landerneau in Brittany.

===Administrative history===
Caernarfon formed part of the ancient parish of Llanbeblig. The parish also included adjoining rural areas, particularly to the south-east where it extended to include the village of Waunfawr. The parish church was St Peblig&#x27;s Church, to the south-east of the walled town. The church stood in relative isolation until the 20th century, but has since been surrounded by the town&#x27;s suburbs.

As part of establishing the castle and fortified town, Edward I of England granted Caernarfon a charter making it a borough in 1284. The Statute of Rhuddlan in the same year created the new county of Caernarfonshire, with Caernarfon serving as county town.

In 1836 Caernarfon became a municipal borough under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country. The Local Government Act 1894 directed that parishes were no longer allowed to straddle borough boundaries, and so the part of the parish of Llanbeblig outside the borough became the separate parish of Waunfawr (initially spelt Waenfawr).

The municipal borough of Caernarfon was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. A community called Caernarfon was created instead, covering the area of the abolished borough. District-level functions passed to Arfon Borough Council, which was in turn replaced in 1996 by Gwynedd Council.

==Demography==
The population in 1841 was 8,001.

The population of Caernarfon Community Parish in 2001 was 9,611. Caernarfon residents are known colloquially as &quot;Cofis&quot;. The word &quot;Cofi&quot; is also used locally in Caernarfon to describe the local Welsh dialect, notable for a number of words not in use elsewhere.

Within Wales, Gwynedd has the highest proportion of speakers of the Welsh language. The greatest concentration of Welsh speakers in Gwynedd is found in and around Caernarfon.

According to the 2011 census, 85.8% of residents were born in Wales, one of the highest proportions in Gwynedd, and 77.0% reported a &quot;Welsh only&quot; national identity.

==Churches==
===St Peblig&#x27;s and Segontium Roman Fort===

Caernarfon historically formed part of the parish of Llanbeblig, named after Saint Peblig, the son of Saint Elen and Macsen Wledig (Magnus Maximus). St Peblig&#x27;s Church stands south-east of the walled town. It is built on an important early Christian site, itself built on a Roman Mithraeum or temple of Mithras. This was located close to the Segontium Roman Fort which lies away. A Roman altar was found in one of the walls of the church during 19th-century restoration work. The present church dates mainly from the 14th century and is built to a Cruciform architectural plan. A major restoration was undertaken in 1894. St Peblig&#x27;s is a Grade I listed building.

===St Mary&#x27;s===
St Mary&#x27;s Church was begun in 1307 as a chapel for the castle and garrison. It is built against the town wall, the Bell Tower acting as a vestry. The church was restored by Benjamin Dean Wyatt in 1811-1814. The exterior mainly reflects Wyatt&#x27;s work, except its north and west walls which are &quot;Master James of St George&#x27;s massive limestone masonry of 1284-1290&quot;, but the arcades in the nave, and other internal elements, are medieval. The church is a Grade I listed building.

===Caernarfon Castle===

The present castle building was constructed between 1283 and 1330 by the order of King Edward I. The banded stonework and polygonal towers are thought to have been in imitation of the Walls of Constantinople. The impressive curtain wall with nine towers and two gatehouses survive largely intact. Caernarfon Castle is now under the care of Cadw and is open to the public. The castle includes the regimental museum of the Royal Welch Fusiliers.

===Caernarfon town walls===

The medieval town walls, including eight towers and two twin-towered gateways, form a complete circuit of around the old town and were built between 1283 and 1285. The walls are in the care of Cadw but only a small section is accessible to the public. The town walls and castle at Caernarfon were declared part of a World Heritage Site in 1986. According to UNESCO, the castle and walls together with other royal castles in Gwynedd &quot;are the finest examples of late 13th century and early 14th century military architecture in Europe&quot;.

===County Hall, police station and gaol===
Caernarfon County Hall and the police station are two former municipal buildings which stand on Castle Ditch, facing the castle walls. Constructed in the mid-19th century, they were designed by John Fisher, the Caernarfonshire county surveyor in a Neoclassical style. They are both Grade I listed buildings. In the 20th century the buildings were vacated. The courthouse was replaced by the new Caernarfon Criminal Justice Centre on the former Segontium School site in Llanberis Road in 2009. The former county hall now operates as an entertainment venue, and the former police station as commercial offices. Adjacent to the old courthouse is the former Caernarfon Gaol which also closed in the early 20th century and converted into council offices.

===Statue of David Lloyd George===
The statue in Castle Square was sculpted by W. Goscombe John and was erected in 1921 when Lloyd George was prime minister. David Lloyd George was the Member of Parliament for the area from 1890 to 1945.

===The Old Market Hall===
The Old Market Hall in Hole-in-the-Wall Street and Crown Street was built in 1832, but the interior and roof were rebuilt later in that century. It is a Grade II listed building. It now acts as a pub and music venue.

===Morfa Common Park===
A small Victorian urban park, Morfa was laid out in 1888. It stands to the south of the town, bordered by the &#x27;Ysbyty Eryri&#x27; hospital [see below] at its southern edge. It is listed at Grade II on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales.

===Others===
Caernarfon has a small hospital, &#x27;Ysbyty Eryri&#x27; (Snowdonia Hospital). The nearest large regional hospital is Ysbyty Gwynedd, in Bangor.

Caernarfon Barracks was commissioned by John Lloyd, County Surveyor of Caernarfonshire, as a military headquarters and completed in 1855.

==Transport==

=== Sea ===
Caernarfon was at one time an important port, exporting slate from the Dyffryn Nantlle quarries. This traffic was facilitated from 1828 by the Nantlle Railway which predated far more widely known ventures such as the Liverpool and Manchester Railway and the Ffestiniog Railway.

=== Rail ===
Five passenger stations have served the town. Caernarvon railway station opened in 1852 as the western terminus of the Bangor and Carnarvon Railway. This connected the town with the North Wales coast and the expanding national network. Carnarvon Castle railway station opened in 1856 as the northern passenger terminus of the 3ft 6in narrow gauge Nantlle Railway. This service ended in 1865 when the line being built from the south by the standard gauge Carnarvonshire Railway took over most of its trackbed. The Carnarvonshire Railway&#x27;s temporary northern terminus was at Pant to the south of the town. Pant station opened in 1867. At the same time, the Carnarvon and Llanberis Railway built its line from Llanberis to Caernarfon. Its temporary western terminus was called Carnarvon (Morfa). It opened in 1869 near the modern road bridges over the Afon Seiont. For a short period, therefore, Caernarfon had three terminating stations on its edges. Records are contradictory, but this ended in either 1870 or 1871 when they were connected by a line through the town using the tunnel which survives, having been converted in 1995 for road traffic. When the through route was opened Pant and Morfa stations closed and the original station became the town&#x27;s only station. The London and North Western Railway also took over all the lines mentioned leaving one station and one service provider by 1871.

The services to Llanberis and south to closed progressively from the 1930s, with tracks being lifted in the mid-1960s, but Caernarvon station survived until 1970, with Bangor to Caernarvon one of the last passenger services to be closed under the Beeching Axe; it is now the site of a Morrisons supermarket. In November 2020 the Welsh Government stated &#x27;further consideration&#x27; should be given to reopening the line. The fifth station was opened in 1997 on the old trackbed in St. Helen&#x27;s Road. It is the northern terminus of the 2ft narrow gauge Rheilffordd Eryri / Welsh Highland Railway. Work began on a permanent station for the town in February 2017. The new station opened to passengers in the Spring of 2019. Heritage steam services provide links to Porthmadog, where passengers can change for services on the Ffestiniog Railway to Blaenau Ffestiniog.

=== Bus ===
Bus services in the town are provided by Arriva Buses Wales, and a number of smaller, local operators. Longer distance, cross-country services are operated by Lloyds Coaches, and connect the town with Bangor to the north, and Aberystwyth via Porthmadog, Dolgellau and Machynlleth to the south. These services are part of the Welsh Government funded TrawsCymru network.

=== Road ===
The A487 trunk road bisects the town, providing access to major urban areas along the North Wales coast and the Port of Holyhead, via the A55 expressway. Llanberis at the foot of Snowdon can be reached via the A4086, which heads east out of the town towards Capel Curig.

=== Bike ===
Heading north out of the town is the Lôn Las Menai cycle path to nearby Y Felinheli. Heading south out of the town is the Lôn Eifion cycle path, which leads to Bryncir, near Criccieth. The route provides views into the Snowdonia mountains, down along the Llŷn Peninsula and across to the Isle of Anglesey.

=== Air ===
Caernarfon Airport is to the southwest, and offers pleasure flights and an aviation museum.

=== Foot ===
The Aber Swing Bridge is a pedestrian swing bridge that crosses over the Afon Seiont to connect pedestrians from the foreshore to the Watergate entrance in the centre of Caernarfon by the Caernarfon Castle.

<doc id="47623" wikidata="Q468591" url="?curid=47623" title="Free Trade Area of the Americas">
<text>The Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA, , ALCA) was a proposed agreement to eliminate or reduce the trade barriers among all countries in the Americas, excluding Cuba. Negotiations to establish the FTAA ended in failure, however, with all parties unable to reach an agreement by the 2005 deadline they had set for themselves.

==History==
===Origins===
Discussions about the Free Trade Area of the Americas began at the first Summit of the Americas in Miami on December 11, 1994. The FTAA came to public attention during the third summit, held in Quebec City in 2001, as the meeting was targeted by large anti-corporatization and anti-globalization protests. The Miami negotiations in 2003 met similar protests, though not as large.

In the last round of negotiations, trade ministers from 34 countries met in Miami, Florida, in the United States, in November 2003 to discuss the proposal. The proposed agreement was an extension of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Discussions have faltered over similar points as the Doha Development Round of World Trade Organization (WTO) talks; developed nations sought expanded trade in services and increased intellectual property rights, while less developed nations sought an end to agricultural subsidies and free trade in agricultural goods. Similar to the WTO talks, Brazil took a leadership role among the less developed nations, while the United States took a similar role for the developed nations.

===Disagreements===
In previous negotiations, the United States had pushed for a single comprehensive agreement to reduce trade barriers for goods, while increasing intellectual property protection. Specific intellectual property protections could include Digital Millennium Copyright Act style copyright protections similar to the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement. Another protection would likely have restricted the importation or cross importation of pharmaceuticals, similar to the proposed agreement between the United States and Canada. Brazil posed a three-track approach that called for a series of bilateral agreements to reduce specific tariffs on goods, a hemispheric pact on rules of origin, and a dispute resolution process Brazil proposed to omit the more controversial issues from the FTA, leaving them to the WTO.

The location of the FTA Secretariat was to have been determined in 2005. The contending cities were: Atlanta, Chicago, Galveston, Houston, San Juan, and Miami in the United States; Cancún and Puebla in Mexico; Panama City, Panama; and Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. The U.S. city of Colorado Springs also submitted its candidacy in the early days but subsequently withdrew. Miami, Panama City and Puebla served successively an interim secretariat headquarters during the negotiation process.

The last summit was held at Mar del Plata, Argentina, in November 2005, but no agreement on FTA was reached. Of the 39 countries present at the negotiations, 20 pledged to meet again in 2006 to resume negotiations, but no meeting took place. The failure of the Mar del Plata summit to establish a comprehensive FTA agenda augured poorly.

===Current status===
The FTAA missed the targeted deadline of 2005, which followed the stalling of useful negotiations of the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 2005. Over the next few years, some governments, most notably the United States, not wanting to lose any chance of hemispheric trade expansion moved in the direction of establishing a series of bilateral trade deals. The leaders planned further discussions at the 6th Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia in 2012, but these discussions did not take place.

As of 2022, U.S. trade policy reflected a withdrawal from a reliance on trade agreements, with a preference for smaller bilateral deals.

==Planned membership==
The following countries were planned to be part of the Free Trade Area of the Americas:

* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 

* 
* 
* 
* 
* 


==Support and opposition==
A vocal critic of the FTAA was Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, who has described it as an &quot;annexation plan&quot; and a &quot;tool of imperialism&quot; for the exploitation of Latin America. As a counterproposal to this initiative, Chávez promoted the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas (&quot;Alianza Bolivariana para las Américas&quot;, ALBA) which emphasizes energy and infrastructure agreements. Evo Morales of Bolivia has referred to the U.S.-backed Free Trade Area of the Americas, as &quot;an agreement to legalize the colonization of the Americas&quot;.

On the other hand, the then presidents of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and Argentina, Néstor Kirchner, have stated that they do not oppose the FTAA but they do demand that the agreement provide for the elimination of U.S. agriculture subsidies, the provision of effective access to foreign markets and further consideration towards the needs and sensibilities of its members.

One of the most contentious issues of the treaty proposed by the United States is with concerns to patents and copyrights. Critics claim that if the measures proposed by the United States were implemented and applied this would reduce scientific research in Latin America. On the Council of Canadians web site, Maude Barlow wrote: &quot;This agreement sets enforceable global rules on patents, copyrights and trademark. It has gone far beyond its initial scope of protecting original inventions or cultural products and now permits the practice of patenting plants and animal forms as well as seeds. It promotes the private rights of corporations over local communities and their genetic heritage and traditional medicines&quot;.

On the weekend of April 20, 2001, the 3rd Summit of the Americas was a summit held in Quebec City, Canada. This international meeting was a round of negotiations regarding a proposed FTAA.

==Agreements==
There are currently 34 countries in the Western Hemisphere, stretching from Canada to Chile that still have the FTAA as a long-term goal. The Implementation of a full multilateral FTAA between all parties could be made possible by enlargement of existing agreements. At this point Agreements within the Area of the Americas include:

===Previous agreements===
* Canada: Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement (1988; superseded by the NAFTA)
* Canada, Mexico and United States: North American Free Trade Agreement (1994; superseded by the USMCA)
* Costa Rica- Dominican Republic (superseded by DR-CAFTA)
* Costa Rica- Trinidad and Tobago (superseded by a Costa Rica – CARICOM FTA).

<doc id="47624" wikidata="Q135" url="?curid=47624" title="Pawn (chess)">
<text>The pawn (♙, ♟) is the most numerous and weakest piece in the game of chess. It may move one square directly forward, it may move two squares directly forward on its first move, and it may capture one square diagonally forward. Each player begins a game with eight pawns, one on each square of their second . The white pawns start on a2 through h2; the black pawns start on a7 through h7.

Individual pawns are referred to by the on which they stand. For example, one speaks of &quot;White&#x27;s f-pawn&quot; or &quot;Black&#x27;s b-pawn&quot;. Alternatively, they can be referred to by the piece which stood on that file at the beginning of the game, e.g. &quot;White&#x27;s king bishop&#x27;s pawn&quot; or &quot;Black&#x27;s queen knight&#x27;s pawn&quot;. It is also common to refer to a &quot;rook&#x27;s pawn&quot;, meaning any pawn on the a- or h-files, a &quot;knight&#x27;s pawn&quot; (on the b- or g-files), a &quot;bishop&#x27;s pawn&quot; (on the c- or f-files), a &quot;queen&#x27;s pawn&quot; (on the d-file), a &quot;king&#x27;s pawn&quot; (on the e-file), and a &quot;central pawn&quot; (on the d- or e-files).

The pawn historically represents soldiers or infantry, or more particularly, armed peasants or pikemen.
==Placement and movement==



Each player begins the game with eight pawns placed along their second rank.

A pawn may move by vertically advancing to a vacant square ahead. The first time a pawn moves, it has the additional option of vertically advancing two squares, provided that both squares are vacant. Unlike other pieces, the pawn can only move forwards. In the second diagram, the pawn on c4 can move to c5; the pawn on e2 can move to either e3 or e4.
===Capturing===


Unlike other pieces, the pawn does not capture in the same way that it moves. A pawn captures by moving diagonally forward one square to the left or right, either replacing an enemy piece on its square (first diagram) or capturing &quot;en passant&quot; (second diagram).

An &quot;en passant&quot; capture can occur after a pawn makes a move of two squares and the square it passes over is attacked by an enemy pawn. The enemy pawn is entitled to capture the moved pawn &quot;in passing&quot; as if the latter had advanced only one square. The capturing pawn moves to the square over which the moved pawn passed, and the moved pawn is removed from the board. The option to capture the moved pawn &quot;en passant&quot; must be exercised on the move immediately following the double-step pawn advance, or it is lost for the remainder of the game. The &quot;en passant&quot; capture is the only capture in chess in which the capturing piece does not replace the captured piece on the same square.
===Promotion===

A pawn that advances to its is &quot;promoted&quot; to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color. The pawn is replaced by the new piece on the same move. The choice of promotion is not limited to pieces that have been captured; thus, a player could, in theory, have as many as nine queens, ten rooks, ten bishops, or ten knights on the board. Promotion to a queen is also known as &quot;queening&quot; and to any other piece as &quot;underpromotion&quot;. Reasons for underpromotion include tactical positions involving a knight check, and avoiding stalemate.

While some chess sets include an extra queen of each color, most standard sets do not come with additional pieces, so the physical piece used to replace a promoted pawn on the board is usually one that was previously captured. In informal games, when the correct piece is not available, an additional queen is often indicated by inverting a previously captured rook. In tournament games, however, this is not acceptable, and may result in the arbiter ruling that the upturned piece is a rook.

==Strategy==

===Pawn structure===
The &quot;pawn structure&quot;, the configuration of pawns on the chessboard, mostly determines the strategic flavor of a game. While other pieces can usually be moved to more favorable positions if they are temporarily badly placed, a poorly positioned pawn is limited in its movement and often cannot be so relocated.

Because pawns capture diagonally and can be blocked from moving straight forward, opposing pawns can become locked in diagonal of two or more pawns of each color, where each player controls squares of one color. In the diagram, Black and White have locked their d- and e-pawns.

Here, White has a long-term advantage. White will have an easier time than Black in finding good squares for their pieces, particularly with an eye to the . Black, in contrast, suffers from a on c8, which is prevented by the black pawns from finding a good square or helping out on the kingside. On the other hand, White&#x27;s central pawns are somewhat and vulnerable to attack. Black can undermine the white pawn chain with an immediate ...c5 and perhaps a later ...f6.
===Isolated pawn===
Pawns on adjacent files can support each other in attack and defense. A pawn that has no friendly pawns in adjacent files is an &quot;isolated pawn&quot;. The square in front of an isolated pawn may become an enduring weakness. Any piece placed directly in front not only blocks the advance of that pawn but also cannot be driven away by other pawns.

In the diagram, Black has an isolated pawn on d5. If all the pieces except the kings and pawns were removed, the weakness of that pawn might prove fatal to Black in the endgame. In the middlegame, however, Black has slightly more freedom of movement than White and may be able to trade off the isolated pawn before an endgame ensues.
===Passed pawn===
A pawn that cannot be blocked or captured by enemy pawns in its path to promotion is a &quot;passed pawn&quot;. Because endgames are often won by the player who can promote a pawn first, having a passed pawn in an endgame can be decisive – especially a protected passed pawn (a passed pawn that is protected by a pawn). In this vein, a pawn &quot;majority&quot;, a greater number of pawns belonging to one player on one side of the chessboard, is strategically important because it can often be converted into a passed pawn.

In the diagram, White has a &quot;protected&quot; passed pawn on c5 and Black has an &quot;outside&quot; passed pawn on h5. This position might appear roughly equal, because each side has a king and three pawns, and the positions of the kings are about equal. In truth, White wins this endgame on the strength of the protected passed pawn, regardless which player moves first. The black king cannot be on both sides of the board at once – to defend the isolated h-pawn and to stop White&#x27;s c-pawn from advancing to promotion. Thus White can capture the h-pawn and then win the game.
===Doubled pawn===
After a capture with a pawn, a player may end up with two pawns on the same , called &quot;doubled pawns&quot;. Doubled pawns are substantially weaker than pawns that are side by side, because they cannot defend each other, they usually cannot both be defended by adjacent pawns, and the front pawn blocks the advance of the back one. In the diagram, the doubled c-pawns are a strategic disadvantage for Black.

There are situations where doubled pawns confer some advantage, typically when the guarding of consecutive squares in a file by the pawns prevents an invasion by the opponent&#x27;s pieces.

Pawns that are both doubled and isolated are typically a tangible weakness. A single piece or pawn in front of doubled isolated pawns blocks both of them, and cannot be easily dislodged. It is rare for a player to have three pawns in a file, i.e. &quot;tripled&quot; pawns.

===Wrong rook pawn===

In chess endgames with a bishop, a may be the &quot;wrong rook pawn&quot;, depending on the square-color of the bishop. This causes some positions to be draws that would otherwise be wins.

==History==
The pawn has its origins in the oldest version of chess, chaturanga, and it is present in all other significant versions of the game as well. In chaturanga, this piece could move one square directly forward and could capture one square diagonally forward.

In medieval chess, as an attempt to make the pieces more interesting, each pawn was given the name of a commoner&#x27;s occupation:
*Gambler and other &quot;lowlifes&quot;, also messengers (in the left-most file, that direction being literally )
*City guard or policeman (in front of the left-side knight, as knights trained city guards in real life)
*Innkeeper (in front of the left-side bishop)
*Doctor (in front of the queen)
*Merchant or money changer (in front of the king)
*Weaver/clerk (in front of the right-side bishop, as they worked for bishops)
*Blacksmith (in front of the right-side knight, as they cared for the horses)
*Worker/farmer (in front of the right-side rook, as they worked for castles)

The most famous example of this is found in the second book ever printed in the English language, &quot;The Game and Playe of the Chesse&quot;. This book, printed by William Caxton, was viewed to be as much a political commentary on society as a chess book. 

The ability to move two spaces and the related ability to capture &quot;en passant&quot; were introduced in 15th-century Europe; the &quot;en passant&quot; capture spread to various regions throughout its history. The &quot;en passant&quot; capture intends to prevent a pawn on its initial square from safely bypassing a square controlled by an enemy pawn. The rule for promotion has changed throughout its history.

===Etymology and word usage===
The term &quot;pawn&quot; is derived from the Old French word &quot;paon&quot;, which comes from the Medieval Latin term for &quot;foot soldier&quot; and is cognate with &quot;peon&quot;. In most other languages, the word for pawn is similarly derived from &quot;paon&quot; (e.g., &quot;pionek&quot; in Polish), its Latin ancestor or some other word for foot soldier. In some languages the term for pawn is a name meaning &quot;peasant&quot; or &quot;farmer&quot;, reflecting how the lower orders were conscripted as footsoldiers in wartime: Hungarian , Slovene , German , Danish/Norwegian/Swedish &quot;bonde&quot;, Latvian . In Irish, the term &#x27;, a diminutive of &#x27; (&quot;chess&quot;) is sometimes used, though the term &quot;ceithearnach&quot; (&quot;foot soldier&quot;) is also used. In Thai the pawn is called เบี้ย (&quot;bîia&quot;), which signifies a cowrie shell or a coin of little value. In Turkish the pawn is called &quot;&quot;, borrowed from the French word Pion in the 19th century.

Outside of the game of chess, &quot;pawn&quot; is often taken to mean &quot;one who is manipulated to serve another&#x27;s purpose&quot;. Because the pawn is the weakest piece, it is often used metaphorically to indicate unimportance or outright disposability, only having utility in the ability to be controlled; for example, &quot;She&#x27;s only a pawn in their game.&quot;

<text>The Yarkovsky effect is a force acting on a rotating body in space caused by the anisotropic emission of thermal photons, which carry momentum. It is usually considered in relation to meteoroids or small asteroids (about 10 cm to 10 km in diameter), as its influence is most significant for these bodies.

The effect was discovered by the Polish-Russian civil engineer Ivan Osipovich Yarkovsky (1844–1902), who worked in Russia on scientific problems in his spare time. Writing in a pamphlet around the year 1900, Yarkovsky noted that the daily heating of a rotating object in space would cause it to experience a force that, while tiny, could lead to large long-term effects in the orbits of small bodies, especially meteoroids and small asteroids. Yarkovsky&#x27;s insight would have been forgotten had it not been for the Estonian astronomer Ernst J. Öpik (1893–1985), who read Yarkovsky&#x27;s pamphlet sometime around 1909. Decades later, Öpik, recalling the pamphlet from memory, discussed the possible importance of the Yarkovsky effect on movement of meteoroids about the Solar System.

==Mechanism==
The Yarkovsky effect is a consequence of the fact that change in the temperature of an object warmed by radiation (and therefore the intensity of thermal radiation from the object) lags behind changes in the incoming radiation. That is, the surface of the object takes time to become warm when first illuminated, and takes time to cool down when illumination stops. In general there are two components to the effect:

* Diurnal effect: On a rotating body illuminated by the Sun (e.g. an asteroid or the Earth), the surface is warmed by solar radiation during the day, and cools at night. The thermal properties of the surface cause a lag between the absorption of radiation from the Sun and the emission of radiation as heat, so the surface is warmest not when the Sun is at its peak but slightly later. This results in a difference between the directions of absorption and re-emission of radiation, which yields a net force along the direction of motion of the orbit. If the object is a prograde rotator, the force is in the direction of motion of the orbit, and causes the semi-major axis of the orbit to increase steadily; the object spirals away from the Sun. A retrograde rotator spirals inward. The diurnal effect is the dominant component for bodies with diameter greater than about 100 m.
* Seasonal effect: This is easiest to understand for the idealised case of a non-rotating body orbiting the Sun, for which each &quot;year&quot; consists of exactly one &quot;day&quot;. As it travels around its orbit, the &quot;dusk&quot; hemisphere which has been heated over a long preceding time period is invariably in the direction of orbital motion. The excess of thermal radiation in this direction causes a braking force that always causes spiraling inward toward the Sun. In practice, for rotating bodies, this seasonal effect increases along with the axial tilt. It dominates only if the diurnal effect is small enough. This may occur because of very rapid rotation (no time to cool off on the night side, hence an almost uniform longitudinal temperature distribution), small size (the whole body is heated throughout) or an axial tilt close to 90°. The seasonal effect is more important for smaller asteroid fragments (from a few metres up to about 100 m), provided their surfaces are not covered by an insulating regolith layer and they do not have exceedingly slow rotations. Additionally, on very long timescales over which the spin axis of the body may be repeatedly changed by collisions (and hence also the direction of the diurnal effect changes), the seasonal effect will also tend to dominate.

In general, the effect is size-dependent, and will affect the semi-major axis of smaller asteroids, while leaving large asteroids practically unaffected. For kilometre-sized asteroids, the Yarkovsky effect is minuscule over short periods: the force on asteroid 6489 Golevka has been estimated at 0.25 newtons, for a net acceleration of 10−12 m/s2. But it is steady; over millions of years an asteroid&#x27;s orbit can be perturbed enough to transport it from the asteroid belt to the inner Solar System.

The mechanism is more complicated for bodies in strongly eccentric orbits.

==Measurement==
The effect was first measured in 1991–2003 on the asteroid 6489 Golevka. The asteroid drifted 15 km from its predicted position over twelve years (the orbit was established with great precision by a series of radar observations in 1991, 1995 and 1999 from the Arecibo radio telescope).

Without direct measurement, it is very hard to predict the exact result of the Yarkovsky effect on a given asteroid&#x27;s orbit. This is because the magnitude of the effect depends on many variables that are hard to determine from the limited observational information that is available. These include the exact shape of the asteroid, its orientation, and its albedo. Calculations are further complicated by the effects of shadowing and thermal &quot;reillumination&quot;, whether caused by local craters or a possible overall concave shape. The Yarkovsky effect also competes with radiation pressure, whose net effect may cause similar small long-term forces for bodies with albedo variations or non-spherical shapes.

As an example, even for the simple case of the pure seasonal Yarkovsky effect on a spherical body in a circular orbit with 90° obliquity, semi-major axis changes could differ by as much as a factor of two between the case of a uniform albedo and the case of a strong north–south albedo asymmetry. Depending on the object&#x27;s orbit and spin axis, the Yarkovsky change of the semi-major axis may be reversed simply by changing from a spherical to a non-spherical shape.

Despite these difficulties, utilizing the Yarkovsky effect is one scenario under investigation to alter the course of potentially Earth-impacting near-Earth asteroids. Possible asteroid deflection strategies include &quot;painting&quot; the surface of the asteroid or focusing solar radiation onto the asteroid to alter the intensity of the Yarkovsky effect and so alter the orbit of the asteroid away from a collision with Earth. The OSIRIS-REx mission, launched in September 2016, studied the Yarkovsky effect on asteroid Bennu.

In 2020, astronomers confirmed Yarkovsky acceleration of the asteroid 99942 Apophis. The findings are relevant to asteroid impact avoidance as 99942 Apophis was thought to have a very small chance of Earth impact in 2068, and the Yarkovsky effect was a significant source of prediction uncertainty.
In 2021, a multidisciplinary professional-amateur collaboration combined Gaia satellite and ground-based radar measurements with amateur stellar occultation observations to further refine 99942 Apophis&#x27;s orbit and measure the Yarkovsky acceleration with high precision, to within 0.5%. With these, astronomers were able to eliminate the possibility of a collision with the Earth for at least the next 100 years.

<text>Llywelyn ap Gruffudd ( – 11 December 1282), Llywelyn II, also known as Llywelyn the Last (), was Prince of Gwynedd, and later was recognised as the Prince of Wales (; ) from 1258 until his death at Cilmeri in 1282. Llywelyn was the son of Gruffudd ap Llywelyn ap Iorwerth and grandson of Llywelyn ab Iorwerth (also known as Llywelyn the Great, or Llywelyn I), and he was one of the last native and independent princes of Wales before its conquest by Edward I of England and English rule in Wales that followed, until Owain Glyndŵr held the title during the Welsh Revolt of 1400–1415.

== Genealogy and early life ==
Llywelyn was the second of the four sons of Gruffudd ap Llywelyn ap Iorwerth, the eldest son of Llywelyn ab Iorwerth, and Senana ferch Caradog, the daughter of Caradoc ap Thomas ap Rhodri, Lord of Anglesey.

The eldest was Owain Goch ap Gruffudd and there were two younger brothers, Dafydd ap Gruffydd and Rhodri ap Gruffudd. Llywelyn is thought to have been born around 1222 or 1223. He is first heard of holding lands in the Vale of Clwyd around 1244.

Following his grandfather&#x27;s death in 1240, Llywelyn&#x27;s uncle, Dafydd ap Llywelyn (who was Llywelyn the Great&#x27;s eldest legitimate son), succeeded him as ruler of Gwynedd. At this time, Llywelyn went on crusade with Richard of Cornwall, brother of Henry III of England.

Llywelyn&#x27;s father, Gruffudd (who was Llywelyn&#x27;s eldest son but illegitimate), and his brother, Owain, were initially kept prisoner by Dafydd, then transferred into the custody of King Henry III of England. Gruffudd died in 1244 from a fall while trying to escape from his cell at the top of the Tower of London. The window from which he attempted to escape the Tower was bricked up and can still be seen to this day. King Henry could no longer use Gruffudd against him, war broke out between Dafydd II and King Henry in 1245. Llywelyn supported his uncle in the savage fighting that followed. Owain, meanwhile, was freed by Henry III after his father&#x27;s death and was given a portion of Snowdonia (Eryri) by Henry at the treaty of Woodstock in 1247.

== Early reign ==
=== Gwynedd ===
Llywelyn and Owain came to terms with King Henry III and in 1247 signed the Treaty of Woodstock at Woodstock Palace. The terms they were forced to accept restricted them to the west of Conwy (Gwynedd Uwch Conwy) around Snowdonia and Anglesey, which was divided between them. The other half of Gwynedd east of Conwy known as the Perfeddwlad was taken over by King Henry.

When Dafydd ap Gruffydd came of age, King Henry accepted his homage and announced his intention to give him part of the already reduced Gwynedd. Llywelyn refused to accept this and Owain and Dafydd formed an alliance against him. This led to the Battle of Bryn Derwin in June 1255. Llywelyn defeated Owain and Dafydd and captured them, thereby becoming the sole ruler of Gwynedd Uwch Conwy. Llywelyn now looked to expand his area of control. The population of Gwynedd Is Conwy resented English rule. This area, also known as &quot;Perfeddwlad&quot; (meaning &quot;middle land&quot;) had been given by King Henry to his son Edward and during the summer of 1256, he visited the area but failed to deal with grievances against the rule of his officers. An appeal was made to Llywelyn, who, that November, crossed the River Conwy with an army, accompanied by his brother, Dafydd, whom he had released from prison. By early December, Llywelyn controlled all of Gwynedd Is Conwy, apart from the royal castle at Dyserth, as a reward for his support and dispossessing his brother-in-law, Rhys Fychan, who supported the king. An English army led by Stephen Bauzan invaded to try to restore Rhys Fychan but was decisively defeated by Welsh forces at the Battle of Cadfan in June 1257, with Rhys having previously slipped away to make his peace with Llywelyn.

=== All of Wales ===
During 1257, Llywelyn aggressively pursued his interests and gained control of lands in Gwrtheyrnion, driving out his cousin, the Anglo-Norman, Roger Mortimer. Then to Powys, which affected his fellow Welshman, Gwenwynwyn, and Deheubarth in South Wales, helping his kin against Norman control going as far as the Bristol Channel, leaving a trail of destruction during the time of Lent. Despite liberating his fellow Welsh folk, some would return to siding with the English upon his departure. The English retaliated by mobilising a force from Scotland to Deganwy in Wales but did not cross into Conwy, which was officially Llywelyn&#x27;s Welsh territory. Henry III waited for an Irish naval force to attack on land from the west to corner Llywelyn, however, his force never arrived. The acts of aggression were followed by a peace truce for 1258, of which the Marcher Lords, did not completely abide by.

The leader of Deheubarth, Rhys Fychan now accepted Llywelyn as overlord, but this caused problems for Llywelyn, as Rhys&#x27;s lands had already been given to Maredudd. Llywelyn restored his lands to Rhys, but the king&#x27;s envoys approached Maredudd and offered him Rhys&#x27;s lands if he would change sides. Maredudd paid homage to Henry in late 1257. After the betrayal, in 1259, Llywelyn jailed Maredudd until Christmas in Criccieth Castle. Maredudd was released only for him to surrender a son as hostage, it was then Dinefwr became a vassal kingdom of Gwynedd.

In early 1258, Llywelyn was using the title Prince of Wales, first used in an agreement between Llywelyn and his supporters and the Scottish nobility associated with the Comyn family. The English Crown refused to recognise this title however, and, in 1263, Llywelyn&#x27;s brother, Dafydd was hostile against the Prince and submitted himself to King Henry.

Then in January 1260, Llywelyn pursued his interests internally by dislodging Roger Mortimer of Buellt. This would be an act of war which would be followed by an English decree which was summoned in Oxford on August 1. Armies assembled at Shrewsbury and Chester with the sole purpose of removing Llywelyn from power. However, the English could not come to an agreement in government over the matter, and a truce was enacted again for a further 2 years. After 2 years the English continued castle building which caused a revolt from the Welsh, who in turn requested and were assisted by Llywelyn in defending their lands in Maelienydd. After, Llywelyn continued his expansion into South Wales to the Lordship of Brecon, where he received fealty from the Welsh who too ousted their Anglo-Norman Marcher Lord Mortimer. This success brought him to the attention of the Montfort family, which would start a new era for Gwynedd and Llywelyn. The change in territory forced Edward I to return to Wales for the first time since 1254.

On 12 December 1263, in the commote of Ystumanner, Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn (Mathrafal, Powys Wenwynwyn) did homage and swore fealty to Llywelyn. In return he was made a vassal lord and the lands taken from him by Llywelyn about six years earlier were restored to him.

== Supremacy in Wales ==
Llywelyn&#x27;s interests were now not solely excluded to Wales. In England, Simon de Montfort (the Younger) defeated the king&#x27;s supporters at the Battle of Lewes in 1264 (Second Barons&#x27; War), capturing the king and Lord Edward. Llywelyn began negotiations with de Montfort, and in 1265, offered him 25,000 marks in exchange for a permanent peace, 5,000 of which immediately and then 3,000 a year thereafter. The Treaty of Pipton, 22 June 1265, established an alliance between Llywelyn and de Montfort, although Pope Clement IV warned Llywelyn against allying himself with the excommunicated Montfort. As well as the rule of the whole Principality, Llywelyn was offered the castles of Maud, Hawarden, Ellesmere and Montgomery. Thus, Llywelyn&#x27;s right to rule the Principality of Wales as the hereditary Prince of Wales would be acknowledged. De Montfort was to die at the Battle of Evesham in 1265, a battle in which Llywelyn took no part. After Simon de Montfort&#x27;s death, Llywelyn launched a campaign in order to rapidly gain a bargaining position before King Henry had fully recovered. In 1265, routed the combined armies of Hamo le Strange and Maurice FitzGerald in North Wales. Llywelyn then moved on to Montgomery, and routed Roger Mortimer&#x27;s army. With these victories and the backing of the papal legate, Ottobuono, Llywelyn opened negotiations with the king and was eventually recognised as Prince of Wales by King Henry in the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267. All of the Welsh princes submitted to Llywelyn II except for Maredudd ap Rhys Gryg. For this recognition he would have to pay the English crown 24,000 marks in installments, this agreement was confirmed by the papacy in Rome. If he wished, Llywelyn could purchase the homage of the one outstanding native prince – Maredudd ap Rhys of Deheubarth – for 5,000 marks. However, Llywelyn&#x27;s territorial ambitions gradually made him unpopular with some minor Welsh leaders, particularly the princes of South Wales.

The Treaty of Montgomery marked the high point of Llywelyn&#x27;s power. Problems began arising soon afterward, initially a dispute with Gilbert de Clare concerning the allegiance of a Welsh nobleman holding lands in Glamorgan. Gilbert built Caerphilly Castle in response to this. King Henry sent a bishop to take possession of the castle while the dispute was resolved but when Gilbert regained the castle by trickery, the king was unable to do anything about it.

Following the death of King Henry in late 1272, with the new King Edward I of England away from the kingdom on a crusade, the rule fell to three men. One of them, Roger Mortimer was one of Llywelyn&#x27;s rivals in the marches. When Humphrey de Bohun tried to take back Brycheiniog, which was granted to Llywelyn by the Treaty of Montgomery, Mortimer supported de Bohun. Llywelyn was also finding it difficult to raise the annual sums required under the terms of this treaty and ceased making payments.

In early 1274, there was a plot by Llywelyn&#x27;s brother, Dafydd, and Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn of Powys Wenwynwyn and his son, Owain, to kill Llywelyn. Dafydd was with Llywelyn at the time, and it was arranged that Owain would come with armed men on 2 February to carry out the assassination; however, he was prevented by a snowstorm. Llywelyn did not discover the full details of the plot until Owain confessed to the Bishop of Bangor. He said that the intention had been to make Dafydd prince of Gwynedd and that Dafydd would reward Gruffydd with lands. Dafydd and Gruffydd fled to England where they were maintained by the king and carried out raids on Llywelyn&#x27;s lands, increasing Llywelyn&#x27;s resentment. When Edward called Llywelyn to Chester in 1275 to pay homage, Llywelyn refused to attend.

Llywelyn also made an enemy of King Edward by continuing to ally himself with the family of Simon de Montfort, even though their power was now greatly reduced. Llywelyn sought to marry Eleanor de Montfort, born c. 1258, Simon de Montfort&#x27;s daughter. They were married by proxy in 1275, but King Edward took exception to the marriage, in part because Eleanor was his first cousin: her mother was Eleanor of England, daughter of King John and princess of the House of Plantagenet. When Eleanor sailed from France to meet Llywelyn, Edward hired men to seize her ship and she was imprisoned at Windsor Castle until Llywelyn made certain concessions.

== Treaty of Aberconwy ==
In 1276, Edward declared Llywelyn a rebel and in 1277, gathered an enormous army to march against him. Edward&#x27;s intention was to disinherit Llywelyn completely and take over Gwynedd Is Conwy himself. He was considering two options for Gwynedd Uwch Conwy: either to divide it between Llywelyn&#x27;s brothers, Dafydd and Owain or to annex Anglesey and divide only the mainland between the two brothers. Edward was supported by Dafydd ap Gruffydd and Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn. Many of the lesser Welsh princes who had supported Llywelyn had hastened to make peace with Edward. By the summer of 1277, Edward&#x27;s forces had left from Chester to reach the River Conwy and encamped at Deganwy, while another force had captured Anglesey and took possession of the harvest there. This deprived Llywelyn and his men of food, forcing them to seek terms. The attack came from all directions from east of the border, Henry de Lacy attacked from Shrewsbury and Montgomeryshire, Roger Mortimer to Builth and Gwenwynwyn returned to take back Cyfeiliog and other parts of Powys. The lack of provisions forced Llywelyn into hiding, but the Welsh did see minor successes against the English.

Following the battles, the result was the Treaty of Aberconwy, signed by Llywelyn on the 9th of November 1277. The outcome and peace accord guaranteed the return of lands to Llywelyn, however at a price. He regained Anglesey and parts of Snowdonia as his Kingdom of Gwynedd ruled as the Prince of Wales with the homage of five lords. He would have to pay a fine of 50,000 marks for the incident and would forgo his share of the rent of Anglesey to the crown. Whilst, the Llyn Peninsula was given to his brother Owain who was released from jail in 1254. Then the Perfeddwlad in Gwynedd was given to Dafydd ap Gruffydd, with a promise that if Llywelyn died without an heir, he would be given a share of Gwynedd Uwch Conwy instead.

With the peace accord in place, Llywelyn went to London and Parliament for the Christmas of 1277 and paid homage to the King of England. Llywelyn met Edward, and his partner Eleanor with the royal family at Worcester, they would marry the next year.

Llywelyn exacted peace for several years, however, the English continued to pursue an Anglicisation policy in Wales. In the North East of Wales, the four cantrefs of the Court of Chester were brought under power violently. Whilst in the South West in Cardiganshire (Ceredigion) and Carmarthenshire the same policy was enacted by local sheriffs. The rough policy forced the Archbishop of Canterbury, John Peckham to attempt to bring harmony between the Church of England and the Church in Wales. In 1280, Peckham met with Llywelyn to make an agreement on the changes. However, Llywelyn&#x27;s intentions were distracted and claimed the truce was broken by his fellow kin, Gruffudd ap Gwenwynwyn. The archbishop reminded Llywelyn that his grievance would not be heard, as Llywelyn&#x27;s terms of Cyfraith Hywel (Welsh law code) were unreasonable in a contemporary setting. However, Llywelyn reconciled with his brother, Dafydd III, and they listened to the grievances of the cantrefs in Chester and once more secretly plotted a revolt together, this time, the forces of Wales were united against the English.

== Marriage and family ==
Llywelyn agreed with Edward I and was given permission to be married at the door of Worcester Cathedral on the 13th of October 1278. It was a minor ceremony attended by the Kings of Scotland and England, the Earl of Lancaster. Eleanor was to die in childbirth on the 19th of June 1282 after she gave birth to a daughter named Gwenllian. A stained glass window exists to this day depicting the wedding of the Prince of Wales and Lady Eleanor. By all accounts, the marriage was a genuine love match; Llywelyn is not known to have fathered any illegitimate children, which is extremely unusual for the Welsh royalty. (In medieval Wales, illegitimate children were as entitled to their father&#x27;s property as legitimate children.)

=== Descendants confusion ===
Since the lifetime of Llywelyn II, sources have differed as to how many children he fathered and whether he has any living descendants today. Llywelyn definitely had one daughter named Gwenllian of Wales. However, she died childless in 1337. He was also alleged to have had another daughter by the same wife, Eleanor de Montfort, named Catherine. However, her existence as Llywelyn&#x27;s first daughter has since been contested by Professor John Edward Lloyd, who said when speaking of Gruffydd Fychan II who supposedly married Catherine&#x27;s granddaughter, Eleanor (parents of Owain Glyndwr): 

Some authors have subsequently adopted Lloyd&#x27;s position and deny the existence of Catherine. However, genealogist Bernard Burke the Norroy and Ulster King of Arms in the 19th century did confirm the evidence of Catherine&#x27;s supposed lineage which continues in modern times with noble families such the former Welsh Barons of Cymmer-yn-Edeirnion (Hughes of Gwerclas), and also the current Croft baronets today.

== Last campaign and death ==


By early 1282, many of the lesser princes who had supported Edward against Llywelyn in 1277 were becoming disillusioned with the exactions of the royal officers. On Palm Sunday that year, Dafydd ap Gruffydd attacked the English at Hawarden Castle and then laid siege to Rhuddlan. Meanwhile, the revolt quickly spread to other parts of Wales, with Aberystwyth Castle captured and burnt by Maredudd ap Rhys Gryg (heir of Prince of South Wales/Deheubarth) and rebellion in South Wales, also inspired by Dafydd according to the annals, where Carreg Cennen Castle was captured. Llywelyn, according to a letter he sent to the Archbishop of Canterbury John Peckham, was not involved in the planning of the revolt. He felt obliged, however, to support his brother and a war began for which the Welsh were ill-prepared.

Events followed a similar pattern to 1277, with Edward&#x27;s forces capturing Gwynedd Is Conwy, Anglesey and taking the harvest. The English force occupying Anglesey tried to cross to the mainland on a bridge of boats but failed and was defeated in the Battle of Moel-y-don. The Archbishop of Canterbury tried mediating between Llywelyn and Edward, and Llywelyn was offered a large estate in England if he would surrender Wales to Edward, while Dafydd was to go on crusade and not return without the king&#x27;s permission. In an emotional reply, which has been compared to the Declaration of Arbroath, Llywelyn said he would not abandon the people whom his ancestors had protected since &quot;the days of Kamber son of Brutus&quot; and rejected the offer.

Llywelyn now left Dafydd to lead the defence of Gwynedd and took a force South, trying to rally support in Mid and South Wales and open up an important second front. On 11 December at the Battle of Orewin Bridge at Builth Wells, he was killed while separated from his army. The exact circumstances are unclear and there are two conflicting accounts of his death. Both accounts agree that Llywelyn was tricked into leaving the bulk of his army and was then attacked and killed. The first account says that Llywelyn and his chief minister approached the forces of Edmund Mortimer and Hugh Le Strange after crossing a bridge. They then heard the sound of battle as the main body of his army was met in battle by the forces of Roger Despenser and Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn. Llywelyn turned to rejoin his forces and was pursued by a lone lancer who struck him down. It was not until some time later that an English knight recognised the body as that of the King. This version of events was written in the north of England some fifty years later and has suspicious similarities with details about the Battle of Stirling Bridge in Scotland.

An alternative version of events written in the east of England by monks in contact with Llywelyn&#x27;s exiled daughter, Gwenllian ferch Llywelyn, and niece, Gwladys ferch Dafydd, states that Llywelyn, at the front of his army, approached the combined forces of Edmund and Roger Mortimer, Hugo Le Strange, and Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn on the promise that he would receive their homage. This was a deception. His army was immediately engaged in fierce battle during which a significant section of it was routed, causing Llywelyn and his eighteen retainers to become separated. At around dusk, Llywelyn and a small group of his retainers (which included clergy) were ambushed and chased into a wood at Aberedw. Llywelyn was surrounded and struck down. As he lay dying, he asked for a priest and gave away his identity. He was then killed and his head hewn from his body. His person was searched and various items recovered, including a list of &quot;conspirators&quot;, which may well have been faked, and his privy seal.

The privy seal of Llywelyn the Last, his wife Eleanor and his brother Dafydd ap Gruffydd are thought to have been melted down by the English after finding them upon their bodies to make a chalice in 1284.

There are legends surrounding the fate of Llywelyn&#x27;s severed head. It is known that it was sent to Edward at Rhuddlan and after being shown to the English troops based in Anglesey, Edward sent the head on to London. In London, it was set up in the city pillory for a day, and crowned with ivy (i.e. to show he was a &quot;king&quot; of Outlaws and in mockery of the ancient Welsh prophecy, which said that a Welshman would be crowned in London as king of the whole of Britain). Then it was carried by a horseman on the point of his lance to the Tower of London and set up over the gate. It was still on the Tower of London 15 years later.

The last resting place of Llywelyn&#x27;s body is not known for certain; however, it has always been tradition that it was interred at the Cistercians Abbey at Abbeycwmhir. On 28 December 1282, Archbishop Peckham wrote a letter to the Archdeacon of Brecon at Brecon Priory:

There is further supporting evidence for this hypothesis in the Chronicle of Florence of Worcester:

Another theory is that his body was transferred to Llanrumney Hall in Cardiff.

The poet Gruffudd ab yr Ynad Coch wrote in an elegy on Llywelyn:

&lt;poem&gt;Do you not see the path of the wind and the rain?
Do you not see the oak trees in turmoil?
Cold my heart in a fearful breast
For the king, the oaken door of Aberffraw&lt;/poem&gt;

There is an enigmatic reference in the Welsh annals Brut y Tywysogion, &quot;... and then Llywelyn was betrayed in the belfry at Bangor by his own men&quot;. No further explanation is given.

== Annexation ==
With the loss of Llywelyn, Welsh morale and the will to resist diminished. Dafydd was Llywelyn&#x27;s named successor. He carried on the struggle for several months, but in June 1283 was captured in the uplands above Abergwyngregyn at Bera Mountain together with his family. He was brought before Edward, then taken to Shrewsbury where a special session of Parliament condemned him to death. He was dragged through the streets, hanged, drawn and quartered.

After the final defeat of 1283, Gwynedd was stripped of all royal insignia, relics and regalia. Edward Longshanks took particular delight in appropriating the royal home of the Gwynedd dynasty. In August 1284, he set up his court at Abergwyngregyn, Gwynedd. With equal deliberateness, he removed all the insignia of majesty from Gwynedd; a coronet was solemnly presented to the shrine of St. Edward at Westminster; the matrices of the seals of Llywelyn, of his wife, and of his brother Dafydd were melted down to make a chalice which was given by the king to Vale Royal Abbey where it remained until the dissolution of that institution in 1538, after which it came into the possession of the family of the final abbot. The most precious religious relic in Gwynedd, the fragment of the True Cross known as Cross of Neith, was paraded through London in May 1285 in a solemn procession on foot led by the king, the queen, the archbishop of Canterbury and fourteen bishops and the magnates of the realm. Edward was thereby appropriating the historical and religious regalia of the house of Gwynedd and placarding to the world the extinction of its dynasty and the annexation of the principality to his Crown. Commenting on this a contemporary chronicler is said to have declared &quot;and then all Wales was cast to the ground&quot;.

Most of Llywelyn&#x27;s relatives ended their lives in captivity with the notable exceptions of his younger brother Rhodri ap Gruffudd, who had long since sold his claim to the crown and endeavoured to keep a very low profile, and a distant cousin, Madog ap Llywelyn, who in 1294 led a revolt and briefly claimed the title Prince of Wales. Llywelyn and Eleanor&#x27;s baby daughter Gwenllian of Wales was captured by Edward&#x27;s troops in 1283. She was interned at Sempringham Priory in England for the rest of her life, becoming a nun in 1317 and dying without issue in 1337, probably knowing little of her heritage and speaking none of her language.

Dafydd&#x27;s two surviving sons were captured and incarcerated at Bristol Gaol, where they eventually died many years later. Llywelyn&#x27;s elder brother Owain Goch ap Gruffudd disappears from the record in 1282. Llywelyn&#x27;s surviving brother Rhodri ap Gruffudd (who had been exiled from Wales since 1272) survived and held manors in Gloucestershire, Cheshire, Surrey, and Powys and died around 1315. His grandson, Owain Lawgoch, later claimed the title Prince of Wales.

== Coat of Arms ==

The Arms of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (and of Owain Glyndŵr and Owain Lawgoch) are here shown graphically, being reproduced from the image on a roll of painted arms c. 1270–1280 Other rolls exist where variations of the coat of arms are found.

== In popular culture ==
The 1982 Bardic Chair at the National Eisteddfod of Wales was awarded to Gerallt Lloyd Owen for his &quot;awdl&quot; &quot;Cilmeri&quot;, which Hywel Teifi Edwards has called the only 20th century &quot;awdl&quot;, that matches T. Gwynn Jones&#x27; 1902 masterpiece &quot;Ymadawiad Arthur&quot; (&quot;The Passing of Arthur&quot;). Owen&#x27;s &quot;Cilmeri&quot; reimagines the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in battle near the village of the same name on 11 December 1282, while leading his doomed uprising against the occupation of Wales by King Edward I of England. Owen&#x27;s poem depicts the Prince as a tragic hero and invests his fall with an anguish unmatched since Gruffudd ab yr Ynad Coch wrote his famous lament for the king immediately following his death. Owen also, according to Edwards, encapsulates in the Prince&#x27;s death the Welsh people&#x27;s continuing &quot;battle for national survival&quot;.
