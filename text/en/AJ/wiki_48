<text>The Godavari (, ) is India&#x27;s second longest river after the Ganga River and drains the third largest basin in India, covering about 10% of India&#x27;s total geographical area. Its source is in Trimbakeshwar, Nashik, Maharashtra. It flows east for , draining the states of Maharashtra (48.6%), Telangana (18.8%), Andhra Pradesh (4.5%), Chhattisgarh (10.9%) and Odisha (5.7%). The river ultimately empties into the Bay of Bengal through an extensive network of distributaries. Its drainage basin is one of the largest in the Indian subcontinent, with only the Ganga and Indus rivers having a larger drainage basin. In terms of length, catchment area and discharge, the Godavari is the largest in peninsular India, and had been dubbed as the Dakshina Ganga (Southern Ganges).

The river has been revered in Hindu scriptures for many millennia and continues to harbour and nourish a rich cultural heritage. In the past few decades, the river has been barricaded by several barrages and dams, keeping a head of water (depth) which lowers evaporation. Its broad river delta houses 729 persons/km2 – nearly twice the Indian average population density and has a substantial risk of flooding, which in lower parts would be exacerbated if the global sea level were to rise.

==Course==


The Godavari originates in the Western Ghats of central India near Nashik in Maharashtra, from the Arabian Sea. It flows for , first eastwards across the Deccan Plateau then turns southeast, entering the Eluru district and Alluri Sitharama Raju district of Andhra Pradesh, until it splits into two distributaries that widen into a large river delta at Dhavaleshwaram Barrage in Rajamahendravaram and then flows into the Bay of Bengal.

The Godavari River has a coverage area of , which is nearly one-tenth of the area of India and is equivalent to the area of the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland put together. The river basin is considered to be divided into 3 sections: 
* Upper (source to the confluence with Manjira), 
* Middle (between confluence of Manjira and Pranhita) and 
* Lower (Pranhita confluence to mouth).

These put together account for 24.2% of the total basin area. The rivers annual average water inflows are nearly 110 billion cubic metres. Nearly 50% of the water availability is being harnessed. The water allocation from the river among the riparian states are governed by the Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal. The river has highest flood flows in India and experienced recorded flood of 3.6 million cusecs in the year 1986 and annual flood of 1.0 million cusecs is normal.

===Within Maharashtra===
The river originates in Maharashtra state and has an extensive course. The upper basin (origin to its confluence with Manjira) of which lies entirely within the state, cumulatively draining an area as large as – about half the area of Maharashtra. Within Nashik district, the river assumes a north-easterly course until it flows into the Gangapur Reservoir created by a dam of the same name. The reservoir along with the Kashypi Dam provides potable water to Nashik, one of the largest cities located on its banks. The river as it emerges through the dam, some upstream from Nashik, flows on a rocky bed undulated by a series of chasms and rocky ledges, resulting in the formation of two significant waterfalls – the Gangapur and the Someshwar waterfalls. The latter, located at Someshwar is more popularly known as the Dudhsagar Waterfall. About east of Gangapur the river passes the town of Nashik where it collects its effluents in the form of the river Nasardi on its right bank.

About south of Nashik, the river bends sharply to the east, washing the base of a high cliff formerly the site of a Mughal fort, but which is now being eroded away by the action of floods. About below Nashik is the confluence of the Godavari and one of its tributaries, the Darna. The stream occupies, for nine months in the year, a small space in a wide and gravelly bed, the greyish banks being high, topped with a deep layer of black soil. A few kilometres after its meeting with the Darna, the Godavari swerves to the north-east, before the Banganga, from the north-west, meets it on the left. The course of the main stream then tends more decidedly south. At Nandur-Madhmeshwar, the Kadva, a second large affluent, brings considerable increase to the waters of the Godavari. The river begins its southeasterly course characteristic of rivers of the Deccan Plateau. The river exits the Niphad Taluka of Nashik and enters the Kopargaon taluka, Ahmednagar District. Within Ahmednagar District the river quickly completes its short course, flowing alongside the town of Kopargaon and reaching Puntamba. Beyond this, the river serves as a natural boundary between the following districts:
* Ahmednagar and Aurangabad: Along the boundary here, it receives its first major tributary the Pravara River, draining the former district. The confluence is located at Pravarasangam. By virtue of a sub-tributary of Pravara – Mandohol, which originates in Pune District – the basin impinges the Pune district. The river at Paithan has been impounded by the Jayakwadi Dam forming the NathSagar Reservoir. Kalsubai located in Godavari basin, is the highest peak in Maharashtra.
* Beed and Jalna
* Beed and Parbhani: Located along here is its merger with Sindphana, an important tributary which drains a considerably large area within Beed. The sub-tributary river Bindusara forms a landmark at Beed.

The river beyond, near the village Sonpeth, flows into Parbhani. In Parbhani district, the river flows through Gangakhed taluka. As mentioned above, the Godavari is also called Dakshinganga so the city is called as Gangakhed (meaning a village on the bank of Ganga). As per Hindu rituals this place is considered quite important for after death peace to flow ashes into the river.

Its course is relatively non-significant except for receiving two smaller streams – Indrayani and Masuli – merging at its left and right banks, respectively. Within the last taluka of the district Parbhani, Purna, the river drains a major tributary of the same name: Purna.

It then exits into the neighbouring district of Nanded where before reaching the town Nanded, it is impounded by the Vishnupuri Dam and thus with it, bringing Asia&#x27;s largest lift irrigation projects to life. A little downstream from Nanded, the river receives Asna, a small stream, on its left bank. It then runs into the controversial Babli project soon ends its course within Maharashtra, albeit temporarily, at its merger with a major tributary – Manjira.

The river after flowing into Telangana, re-emerges to run as a state boundary separating the Mancherial, Telangana from Gadchiroli, Maharashtra. At the state border, it runs between Sironcha and Somnoor Sangam receiving one tributary at each of those nodal points – the Pranhita and subsequently the Indravati.

===Within Telangana===
Godavari enters into Telangana in Nizamabad district at Kandakurthy where Manjira, Haridra rivers joins Godavari and forms Triveni Sangamam. The river flows along the border between Nirmal and Mancherial districts in the north and Nizamabad, Jagtial, Peddapalli districts to its south. About after entering Telangana it merges with the back waters of the Sriram Sagar Dam. The river after emerging through the dam gates, enjoys a wide river bed, often splitting to encase sandy islands. The river receives a minor but significant tributary Kadam river. It then emerges at its eastern side to act as a state border with Maharashtra only to later enter into Bhadradri Kothagudem district. In this district, the river flows through an important Hindu pilgrimage town – Bhadrachalam.

The river further swells after receiving a minor tributary Kinnerasani River and exits into Andhra Pradesh.

===Within Andhra Pradesh===
Within the state of Andhra Pradesh, the river flows through hilly terrain of the Eastern Ghats known as the Papi hills which explains the narrowing of its bed as it flows through a gorge for a few km, only to re-widen at Polavaram. The deepest bed level of a submarine plunge pool in Godavari River, located 36 km upstream of Polavaram dam, is at 45 meters below the sea level. Before crossing the Papi hills, it receives its last major tributary Sabari River on its left bank. The river upon reaching the plains begins to widen out until it reaches Rajamahendravaram. Arma Konda () is the highest peak in the Godavari river basin as well as in Eastern Ghats.

Dowleswaram Barrage was constructed across the river in Rajamahendravaram. At Rajamahendravaram, the Godavari splits into two large branches which are called Gautami (Gautami Godavari) and Vasishta Godavari and five smaller branches. Similarly, the Vasishta splits into two branches named Vasishta and Vainateya. These four branches which join the Bay of Bengal at different places, form a delta of length along the coast of the Bay of Bengal and is called the Konaseema region. This delta along with the delta of the Krishna River is called the &quot;Rice Granary&quot; of South India.

===Within Puducherry===
The Gautami which is the largest branch of the whole passes along Yanam enclave of Union territory of Puducherry and empties itself into sea at &quot;Point Godavery&quot;. In fact, Yanam is bounded on south by Gautami branch and the Coringa River originates at Yanam which merges into the sea near Coringa village in Andhra Pradesh.
==Discharge==

Mean annual, minimum and maximum discharge (Q – m3/s) at Rajahmundry (period from 1998/01/01 to 2023/12/31):
==Tributaries==
The major left bank tributaries include the Purna, Pranhita, Indravati, and Sabari River, covering nearly 59.7% of the total catchment area of the basin. The right bank tributaries Pravara, Manjira, and Manair contribute 16.1% of the basin.

The Pranhita River is the largest tributary of the Godavari River, covering about 34% of its drainage basin. Though the river proper flows only for , by virtue of its extensive tributaries Wardha, Wainganga, Penganga, the sub-basin drains all of Vidharba region as well as the southern slopes of the Satpura Ranges. Indravati is the 2nd largest tributary, known as the &quot;lifeline&quot; of the Kalahandi, Nabarangapur of Odisha and Bastar district of Chhattisgarh. Due to their enormous sub-basins both Indravati and Pranhita are considered rivers in their own right. Manjira is the longest tributary and holds the Nizam Sagar reservoir. Purna is a prime river in the water scarce Marathwada region of Maharashtra.

Other than these seven principal tributaries, it has many smaller but significant ones draining into it. Indravati river floodwaters overflow into the Jouranala which is part of Sabari basin. A barrage at is constructed across the Indravati river to divert Indravati water in to Sabari river for enhanced hydropower generation.

=== Seven mouths of Godavari ===
Before merging into the Bay of Bengal, the Godavari has seven mouths in total and is considered sacred by local Hindus. As per their traditional belief, the holy waters of the Godavari are said to have been brought from the head of Shiva by the &quot;Rishi Gautama&quot;, and the seven branches by which it is traditionally supposed to have reached the sea are said have been made by seven great rishis known as Sapta Rishis. Thus, they are named after these seven great rishis and are named as Tulyabhāga (Tulya or Kaśyapa), Ātreya (Atri), Gautamī (Gautama), Jamadagni (now replaced by Vṛddhagautamī i.e. Old Gautami), Bhardvāja (Bharadvaja), Kauśika (Visvamitra) and Vaśișțha (Vasishtha). So bathing in these mouths are considered an act of great religious efficacy by native Hindus. These mouths are remembered by a Sanskrit sloka as follow:

Together they are referred as &quot;Sapta Godavari&quot; and the Godavari river before splitting is referred as &quot;Akhanda Godavari&quot;. However, there exists another eight mouth named as Vainateyam, which is not one of these traditional seven mouths and is supposed to have been created by a rishi of that name who stole a part of Vasisththa branch. Godavari was frequently referred as Ganga or Ganges by ancient Indian writings. However, the original branches of &quot;Kauśika&quot;, &quot;Bhardwaja&quot; and &quot;Jamadagni&quot; does not exist any longer and the pilgrims bathe in the sea at the spots where they are supposed to have been. The traditional Bharadwāja mouth is in &quot;Tirthālamondi&quot; (now bordering Savithri Nagar of Yanam and before a Hamlet of Guttenadivi) and the traditional Kauśika mouth is located at Rameswaram, a hamlet of Samathakurru village in Allavaram Mandal of Konaseema district. Traditional mouth of Jamadagni is not known and people instead take bath in the Vriddha Gautami branch at Kundaleswaram village in Katrenikona Mandal of Konaseema district. There is a local legend saying the &quot;Injaram&quot; and &quot;Patha (Old) Injaram&quot; (now on the other bank of Gautami river within Island Polavalam mandal of Konaseema district) were split by Godavari river. Thus the Godavari passing between these two now referred as Gautami and the old passage being referred as Vriddha Gautami. In early British records, the Injaram &quot;Paragana&quot; (district) was counted along with Muramalla village (now located on the other side of Gautami within Island Polavalam mandal) and said to have comprised 22 villages.

==Religious significance==

The river is sacred to Hindus and has several places on its banks that have been places of pilgrimage for thousands of years. Amongst the huge numbers of people who have bathed in her waters as a rite of cleansing are said to have been the deity Baladeva 5000 years ago and the saint Chaitanya Mahaprabhu 500 years ago. Every twelve years, the Pushkaram fair is held on the banks of the river.
A legend has it that the sage Gautama lived in the Brahmagiri Hills at Tryambakeshwar with his wife Ahalya. The couple lived the rest of their lives in the then village called &quot;Govuru&quot;, now known as Kovvur (&quot;cow&quot;) since British rule. Ahalya lived in a nearby place called &quot;Thagami&quot; (now Thogummi). The sage, as a reason for the practice of &quot;annadanam&quot; (&quot;giving away food&quot; to the needy), started cultivating rice crops and other crops. Once, the god Ganesha, on the wish of the sages, sent a miraculous cow &quot;mayadhenu&quot;, which resembled a normal cow. It entered the sage&#x27;s abode and started spoiling the rice while he was meditating. Since cattle is sacred to Hindus and treated with respect, he put the &quot;darbha&quot; grass on the cow. But, to his surprise, it fell dead. Seeing what happened before their eyes, the sages and their wives cried out, &quot;We thought that Gautama-maharishi is a righteous man, but he committed bovicide (killing of a cow or cattle)!&quot;. The sage wished to atone for this grievous sin. Therefore, he went to Nashik and observed tapas (penance) to propitiate Tryambakeshvara (a manifestation of the god Shiva), on the advice of the sages, praying for atonement and asking him to make the Ganges flow over the cow. Shiva was pleased with the sage and diverted the Ganges, which washed away the cow and gave rise to the Godavari River in Nashik. The water stream flowed past Kovvur and ultimately merged with the Bay of Bengal.

=== Sapta Sāgara Yatra ===
In olden days a pilgrimage named as &quot;sapta sāgara yātra&quot; was made by those desirous of offspring along the banks of the holy waters from the seven mouths. It starts with holy bathing at Tulyabhaga river at Chollangi village on Amavasya during Krishna Paksha of Pushya month as per Hindu calendar. That day is locally referred as &quot;Chollangi Amavasya&quot;. That place where the river branch merges with sea is referred as &quot;Tulya Sāgara Sangamam&quot;. Secondly, they take bath in Coringa village in the Coringa river which is considered as Atreya branch of Godavari and the holy bathing place is called as &quot;Atreya Sāgara Sangamam&quot;. After bathing at different banks of the other branches the pilgrimage ends by bathing near Narsapuram or Antarvedi.

==Crossings==

There are 4 bridges spanning the river between East Godavari and West Godavari districts.
# Old Godavari Bridge (also known as Havelock bridge, and named after then Madras governor)
# Godavari Bridge (also known as Rail-cum-road bridge and Kovvur-Rajahmundry Bridge)
# Godavari Arch Bridge (also known as New railway bridge)
# Godavari Fourth Bridge (also known as new road bridge)

Details:
* Old Godavari Bridge. Construction of this bridge started in 1876, and was completed in 1897. It was constructed under the supervision of F.T. Granville Walton who had constructed the Dufferin Bridge over the Ganges, and Granville Mills, both British engineers. Spanning over 3 km in length, it linked the East Godavari and West Godavari districts. The bridge has been a vital link enabling trains to run between Chennai and Howrah. Trains continued over the bridge for a century until 1997, when train services over the bridge were suspended after the construction of two additional bridges.
* Godavari Bridge. Construction of this bridge started in 1970, and was completed in 1974. It serves as both a railway and a roadway between the East Godavari and West Godavari Districts.
* Godavari Arch Bridge. This bridge was completed in 1997, was built upstream of the earlier bridges.
* Godavari Fourth Bridge. This bridge is the newest. It was opened to public from Godavari Pushkaras 2015. This is a road connectivity bridge link supposed to ease traffic flow between Rajamahendravaram and Kovvur

==Dams==
The main Godavari River up to the confluence with Pranhita tributary is dammed fully to utilize the available water for irrigation. However, its main tributaries Pranhita, Indravati and Sabari which join in the lower reaches of the basin, carry three times more water compared to main Godavari. In 2015, the water surplus Godavari River is linked to the water deficit Krishna River by commissioning the Polavaram right bank canal with the help of Pattiseema lift scheme to augment water availability to the Prakasam Barrage located in Andhra Pradesh. More dams are constructed in the Godavari River basin than in any other river basin of India. The following are the few dams located in the river basin:
* Gangapur Dam: This is a large earth fill dam with gross water storage of 215.88 million cubic metres, and located upstream from Nashik city. The reservoir known as the Gangapur Bandh Sagar provides drinking water to the Nashik city and also supplies water to the thermal power station situated downstream at Eklahare.
* Jayakwadi Dam: Located near Paithan, it is one of the largest earthen dams in India. This dam was built to address the dual problems of flooding along the banks, during monsoon months, and that of drought, rest of the year, in the Marathwada region. Two &#x27;left&#x27; and &#x27;right&#x27; canals provide the irrigation to fertile land up to Nanded district. This dam has contributed to industrial development of Aurangabad and Jalna, Maharashtra. Majalgaon Dam is also constructed under Jayakwadi stage 2 to expand the irrigation potential further in Parbhani, Nanded and Beed districts.
* Vishnupuri barrage: Asia&#x27;s Largest Lift Irrigation project, the Vishnupuri Prakalp has been constructed on the river at a distance of from the city Nanded.
* Ghatghar Dam was built for hydro power generation by diverting the water of Pravara tributary outside Godavari river basin to a west flowing river which joins Arabian sea.
* Upper Vaitarna reservoir was built across west flowing Vaitarna river merging some part of Godavari river catchment area. Godavari water impounded in this reservoir is diverted outside the river basin for Mumbai city drinking water supply after generating hydro power.
* Sriram Sagar Dam: This is another multipurpose project on the Godavari River on the borders of Adilabad and Nizamabad District. It is near the town of Pochampadu, 60 km away from Nizamabad. It has been described by The Hindu as a &quot;lifeline for a large part of Telangana&quot;. It serves the irrigation needs in Karimnagar, Warangal, Adilabad, Nalgonda, and Khammam districts and also generates power.
* Sir Arthur Cotton Barrage was built by Sir Arthur Cotton in 1852. It got damaged in 1987 floods, and rebuilt as a barrage cum roadway soon after and named after him. The roadway connects Rajamahendravaram in East Godavari and Vijjeswaram in West Godavari. The irrigation canals of this barrage also form part of National Waterway 4.

==Hydro power stations==
The Godavari River in Maharashtra is one of the rivers whose water energy is least harnessed for generating hydro electricity. The 600 MW capacity Upper Indravati hydro power station is the biggest hydro power station which diverts Godavari River water to the Mahanadi River basin. The following is the list of hydro electric power stations excluding small and medium installations.

==Unutilized water==
Nearly 2490 tmcft of water has gone waste to the sea on average in a water year from 1 June 2003 to 31 May 2022 (19 years). The yearly water unutilized is given below
There is least possibility to construct new reservoirs in the river basin area due to land submergence and displacement of population. However, a freshwater coastal reservoir, located on the adjacent sea, with adequate storage capacity (nearly 29 billion m3) is economically feasible to harness the remaining unutilized water in the river.

==Geology and sediment transfer in the Godavari Drainage Basin==
The primary and initial catchment of the Godavari drainage basin is largely represented by the basalt of the Deccan Volcanic Province (~50% of the total basin area). This is followed by the Precambrian granites and gneisses of the eastern Dharwar Craton, sandstones, shales and limestones of the Gondwana Supergroup, various sedimentary units of Cuddapah and Vindhyan basins, charnockites and khondalites of the Proterozoic Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt and the sandstones of the Rajahmundry Formation. The Godavari River carries the largest sediment load among the peninsular rivers and the majority of the mass transfer in Godavari occurs during the monsoon. Mineral magnetic studies of the Godavari River sediments suggest that the floodplains in the entire stretch of the river are characterized by a Deccan basalt source. The bed loads on the other hand are of sourced from local bedrock. Influx of Deccan source in the Godavari River up to the delta regions and possibly in the Bay of Bengal off the Godavari, therefore, can be related to the intensive chemical weathering in the Deccan basalts. Abrupt increase in δ13C values and decrease in TOC content accompanied with a significant increase in ferrimagnetic mineral concentration in Bay of Bengal sediments from ~3.2 to 3.1 cal. ka BP reflected a shift of organic carbon and sediment source and a severe decline in vegetation coverage. Such phenomena indicate intensified deforestation and soil/rock erosion in the Deccan Plateau producing higher ferrimagnetic mineral inputs, which is in agreement with significant expansion of agricultural activities in the Deccan Chalcolithic cultural period.

==Mineral deposits==

The Godavari River basin is endowed with rich mineral deposits such as oil and gas, coal, iron, limestone, manganese, copper, bauxite, granite, laterite, and others. The following are the few noted deposits:

* Araku hills, bauxite
* Godavari Valley Coalfield, coal
* Bailadila iron, iron
* Krishna Godavari Basin, oil &amp; gas
* Malanjkhand, copper
* MOIL, manganese
* Pench Kanhan Coalfield, coal
* Rowghat Mines, iron
* Wardha Valley Coalfield, coal
* River plunge pools across Papikondalu, gold
==Ecological concerns==
The frequent drying up of the Godavari River in the drier months has been a matter of great concern. Indiscriminate damming along the river has been cited as an obvious reason. Within Maharashtra sugarcane irrigation has been blamed as one of the foremost causes.

In 2013, the river was at its all-time low in the Nizamabad district of Telangana. This had hit the growth of fish, making the life of fishermen miserable. The water-level was so low that people could easily walk into the middle of the river. Shortage in rainfall and closure of the controversial Babli project gates in Maharashtra was thought to have affected the water flow in the river and water availability to the Sriram Sagar Project except during above 20% excess monsoon (i.e. one out of four years) years.

A study has found that the delta is at a greater risk as the rate of sediment aggradation (raising the level of the delta through sediment deposition) no longer exceeds relative sea level rise. It further states that the suspended sediment load at the delta has reduced from 150·2 million tons during 1970–1979 to 57·2 million tons by 2000–2006, which translates into a three-fold decline in the past 4 decades. Impacts of this can be seen in destroyed villages like Uppada in Godavari delta, destruction of Mangrove forests and fragmentation of shoreline – possibly a fallout of dam construction.

Said to further epitomise the insensitivity towards Godavari, is the Polavaram Project which is touted to be gigantic – both in terms of size and violations. Deemed as being pointless and politically driven, the project raises questions about environmental clearance, displacement of upstream human habitations, loss of forest cover, technicalities in the dam design which are said to play down flood threats and unsafe embankments.

High alkalinity water is discharged from the ash dump areas of many coal fired power stations into the river which further increases the alkalinity of the river water whose water is naturally of high alkalinity since the river basin is draining vast area of basalt formations. This problem aggravates during the lean flow months in entire river basin. Already the Godavari basin area in Telangana is suffering from high alkalinity and salinity water problem which is converting soils in to unproductive sodic alkali soils. The following are the few coal fired power stations located in the river basin:

==In popular culture==
One of the ships of the Indian Navy has been named INS &quot;Godavari&quot; after the river. &quot;Godavari&quot; is also the codename of some variants of AMD APU chips.

<text>Year 218 ([[Roman numerals|CCXVIII]]) was a common year starting on Thursday of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Severus and Adventus (or, less frequently, year 971 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 218 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

<text>An urban growth boundary (UGB) is a regional boundary, set in an attempt to control urban sprawl by, in its simplest form, mandating that the area inside the boundary be used for urban development and the area outside be preserved in its natural state or used for agriculture. Legislating for an urban growth boundary is one way, among many others, of managing the major challenges posed by unplanned urban growth and the encroachment of cities upon agricultural and rural land.

An urban growth boundary circumscribes an entire urbanized area and is used by local governments as a guide to zoning and land use decisions, and by utilities and other infrastructure providers to improve efficiency through effective long term planning (e.g. optimising sewerage catchments, school districts, etc.).

If the area affected by the boundary includes multiple jurisdictions a special urban planning agency may be created by the state or regional government to manage the boundary. In a rural context, the terms town boundary, village curtilage or village envelope may be used to apply the same constraining principles. Some jurisdictions refer to the area within an urban growth boundary as an urban growth area (UGA) or urban service area, etc. While the names are different, the concept is the same.

==History==

Opposition to unregulated urban growth and ribbon development began to grow towards the end of the 19th century in England. The campaign group Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) was formed in 1926 and exerted environmentalist pressure. Implementation of the notion dated from Herbert Morrison&#x27;s 1934 leadership of the London County Council. It was first formally proposed by the Greater London Regional Planning Committee in 1935, &quot;to provide a reserve supply of public open spaces and of recreational areas and to establish a green belt or girdle of open space&quot;.

New provisions for compensation in the &quot;1947 Town and Country Planning Act&quot; allowed local authorities around the country to incorporate green belt proposals in their first development plans. The codification of Green Belt policy and its extension to areas other than London came with the historic Circular 42/55 inviting local planning authorities to consider the establishment of Green Belts.

In the United States, the first urban growth boundary was established in 1958, around the city of Lexington, Kentucky. Lexington&#x27;s population was expanding, and city leaders were concerned about the survival of the surrounding horse farms closely tied to the city&#x27;s cultural identity. The first statewide urban growth boundary policy was implemented in Oregon, under then governor Tom McCall, as part of the state&#x27;s land-use planning program in the early 1970s. Tom McCall and his allies convinced the Oregon Legislature in 1973 to adopt the nation&#x27;s first set of statewide land use planning laws. McCall, with the help of a unique coalition of farmers and environmentalists, persuaded the Legislature that the state&#x27;s natural beauty and easy access to nature would be lost in a rising tide of urban sprawl. The new goals and guidelines required every city and county in Oregon to have a long-range plan addressing future growth that meets both local and statewide goals. The state of Tennessee passed the Tennessee Growth Policy Act
(TGPA) in 1998 as a response to the state&#x27;s growing population, increased land development, and conflicts regarding municipal annexation. Tennessee in the year prior to the TGPA&#x27;s passing was ranked 4th in the United States for fastest rates of land development.

==Places with urban growth boundaries==

===Albania===
Albania maintains the &#x27;yellow line&#x27; system hailing from its socialist regime — limiting urban development beyond a designated boundary for all municipalities.

===Australia===
After the release of Melbourne 2030 in October 2002, the state government of Victoria legislated an urban growth boundary to limit urban sprawl. Since then, the urban growth boundary has been significantly increased a number of times.

===Canada===
In Canada, Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa (the &quot;Greenbelt&quot;), London, and Waterloo, Ontario have boundaries to restrict growth and preserve greenspace. In Montreal and in the rest of Quebec, an agricultural protection law serves a similar purpose by restricting urban development to white zones and forbidding it on green zones.

Such boundaries are notably absent from cities such as Calgary, Edmonton, and Winnipeg that lie on flat plains and have expanded outwardly on former agricultural land. In British Columbia, the Agricultural Land Reserve serves a similar purpose adjacent to urban areas.

===China===
In 2017, Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping delivered a speech in the 19th National Congress, in which he mentioned the delineation of &quot;boundaries for urban development&quot; (). On November 11, 2019, the Party General Office and the General Office of the State Council issued a guiding opinion, requiring &quot;three control lines&quot;, including boundaries of urban development, to be designated in territorial spatial planning.

====Hong Kong====
In the plan of some new towns, green belts are included and growth cannot sprawl into or across the green belts. In addition a majority of new towns are surrounded by country parks.

===France===

In France, Rennes decided in the 1960s to maintain a green belt after its ring road. This green belt is named &quot;Ceinture verte&quot;.

===New Zealand===
Over the past two decades, Greater Auckland has been subject to a process of growth management facilitated through various strategic and legislative documents. An overarching objective has been to manage the growth of Auckland in a higherdensity, centres-based manner consistent with the Auckland Regional Growth Strategy. Effect is given to that strategy through a series of layers of control including the &quot;Local Government Amendment (Auckland) Act&quot;, the &quot;Regional Policy Statement&quot; and then via District Plans. A key outcome of the process was the establishment of a metropolitan urban limit (MUL) or urban fence, which dictated the nature and extent of urban activities that could occur within the MUL and hence also dictated the relative values of land within the MUL.

===Romania===
Containment of built-up development is defined through a General Zoning Plan in the case of both urban and rural municipalities. The plan defines the &#x27;intravilan&#x27; as the boundary within which built-up development is allowed. Oradea municipality provides tools to verify if land parcels are located in intravilan or not.

===South Africa===
An integrated development plan is required in terms of Chapter 5 of the national &quot;Municipal Systems Act&quot; No 32 of 2000 for all local authorities in South Africa. This plan would include a spatial development framework plan as one of its components, which would require larger metropolitan areas to indicate an urban edge beyond which urban-type development would be largely restricted or forbidden. The concept was introduced in the 1970s by the Natal Town and Regional Planning Commission of the Province of Natal (now known as KwaZulu-Natal) in the regional guide plans for Durban and Pietermaritzburg. The concept was at that stage termed an &quot;urban fence&quot;.

===United Kingdom===

Controls to constrain the area of urban development existed in London as early as the 16th century. In the middle of the 20th century the countryside abutting the London conurbation was protected by the Metropolitan Green Belt. Further green belts were then created around other urban areas in the United Kingdom.

=== United States ===

The U.S. states of Oregon, Washington and Tennessee require cities and counties to establish urban/county growth boundaries.

Oregon restricts the development of farm and forest land. Oregon&#x27;s law provides that the growth boundary be adjusted regularly to ensure adequate supply of developable land; as of 2018 the boundary had been expanded more than thirty times since it was created in 1980. In the Metro area, the urban growth boundary has to have enough land within it for 20 years of growth; it is reviewed every six years. Other cities in Oregon seek regulatory review of proposed urban growth boundary expansions as needed. Some economic analysis has concluded that farmland lying immediately outside of Portland&#x27;s growth boundary is worth as little as one-tenth as much as similar land located immediately on the other side; other analysis have found that the UGB has no effect on prices when some other variables are taken into account.

Washington&#x27;s Growth Management Act, modeled on Oregon&#x27;s earlier law and approved in 1990, affected mostly the state&#x27;s more urban counties: as of 2018, Clark County, King County, Kitsap County, Pierce County, Snohomish County, and Thurston County.

In Tennessee, the boundaries are not used to control growth per se, but rather to define long-term city boundaries. (This was a response to a short-lived law in the late 1990s allowing almost any group of people in the state to form their own city). Every county in the state (except those with consolidated city-county governments) has to set a &quot;planned growth area&quot; for each of its municipalities, which defines how far out services such as water and sewer will go. In the Memphis area, annexation reserves have been created for all municipalities in the county. These are areas that have been set aside for a particular municipality to annex in the future. Cities cannot annex land outside of these reserves, so in effect the urban growth boundaries are along the borders of these annexation reserves. Additionally, new cities are only allowed to incorporate in areas determined to be planned for urban growth.

California requires each county to have a Local Agency Formation Commission, which sets urban growth boundaries for each city and town in the county.

States such as Texas use the delineation of extraterritorial jurisdictional boundaries to map out future city growth with the idea of minimizing competitive annexations rather than controlling growth.

Notable U.S. cities surrounded by UGBs include Portland, Oregon; Boulder, Colorado; Honolulu, Hawaii; Virginia Beach, Virginia; Lexington, Kentucky; Seattle, Washington; Knoxville, Tennessee; and San Jose, California. Urban growth boundaries also exist in Miami-Dade County, Florida and the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area of Minnesota. In Miami-Dade, it is referred to as the Urban Development Boundary (UDB), and is generally to protect from continued sprawl into and drainage of the Everglades. Portland, Oregon is required to have an urban growth boundary which contains at least of vacant land.

Urban growth boundaries have come under an increasing amount of scrutiny in the past 10 years as housing prices have substantially risen, especially on the West Coast of the U.S. By limiting the supply of developable land, critics argue, UGBs increase the price of existing developable and already-developed land. As a result, they theorize, housing on that land becomes more expensive. In Portland, Oregon, for example, the housing boom of the previous four years drove the growth-management authority to substantially increase the UGB in 2004. While some point to affordability for this action, in reality it was in response to Oregon State law. By law, Metro, the regional government, is required to maintain a 20-year supply of land within the boundary. Even with the addition of several thousand acres (several km2) housing prices continued to rise at record-matching paces. Supporters of UGBs point out that Portland&#x27;s housing market is still more affordable than other West Coast cities, and housing prices have increased across the country.

<text>Year 215 ([[Roman numerals|CCXV]]) was a common year starting on Sunday of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Laetus and Sulla (or, less frequently, year 968 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 215 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Roman Empire ====
* Caracalla&#x27;s troops massacre the population of Alexandria, Egypt, beginning with the leading citizens. The emperor was angry about a satire, produced in Alexandria, mocking his claim that he killed Geta in self-defense.
* A coin, the Antoninianus, is introduced. The weight of this coin is a mere 1/50 of a pound. Copper disappears gradually, and by the middle of the third century, with Rome&#x27;s economy in crisis, the Antonianus will be the only official currency.

==== China ====
* Zhang Liao holds off Sun Quan&#x27;s invasion force at the Battle of Xiaoyao Ford in Hefei, China.

==== Caucasus ====
* Vachagan I becomes king of Caucasian Albania.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==

<text>Year 989 ([[Roman numerals|CMLXXXIX]]) was a common year starting on Tuesday of the Julian calendar.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Byzantine Empire ====
* Emperor Basil II uses his contingent of 6,000 Varangians to help him defeat Bardas Phokas (the Younger), who suffers a seizure during the siege of Abydos (threatening to blockade the Dardanelles). Phokas dies, ending the revolt and threat to Constantinople. Upon Phokas&#x27; death, the other rebel leader Bardas Skleros (who is captured and blinded) yields to Basil&#x27;s superior forces.

==== Europe ====
* Summer – Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine, captures the city of Reims by treachery of its new archbishop, Arnulf (the illegitimate son of the late King Lothair III). King Hugh I (Capet) demands that Pope John XV discipline Arnulf. But John XV, not wishing to defy Empress Theophanu, refuses.
* Winter – Theophanu arrives with her son, King Otto III in Rome to meet John XV. Crescentius II (the Younger) offers his submission to the Holy Roman Empire, in return for which she confirms his title as patrician of Rome.

=== By topic ===

==== Religion ====
* Council of Charroux: French bishops under the patronage of William IV, duke of Aquitaine, declare the first Peace of God (or Pax Dei). This agreement grants immunity from violence to noncombatants (peasants and clergy) who can not defend themselves.

==== Art ====
* October 25 – The Hagia Sophia at Constantinople is struck by a great earthquake, causing the collapse of the western dome arch. Basil II asks the Armenian architect Trdat, the creator of the Cathedral of Ani, to direct the repairs.

<text>Year 988 ([[Roman numerals|CMLXXXVIII]]) was a leap year starting on Sunday of the Julian calendar.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Byzantine Empire ====
* Fall – Emperor Basil II, supported by a contingent of 6,000 Varangians (the future Varangian Guard), organizes the defences of Constantinople to meet a threat from the insurgents, Bardas Phokas the Younger and Bardas Skleros. Basil crosses the Bosphorus, and leads a surprise attack on the rebel camp of Kalokyros Delphinas, at Chrysopolis. Delphinas is captured and executed, either by crucifixion or by impalement (approximate date).

==== Europe ====
* April 1 – 16-year old Robert II of France (&quot;Robert the Pious&quot;) is married to the much older Rozala (the widow of Arnulf II). The marriage is arranged by Robert&#x27;s father, King Hugh Capet, to secure the loyalty of the County of Flanders. 
* Borrell II, count of Barcelona, does not renew his allegiance to Hugh Capet. He becomes a &quot;de facto&quot; independent ruler, and starts minting its own currency – this will be confirmed legally by the Treaty of Corbeil (1258).
* Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine (younger brother of the late King Lothair of France), revolts against Hugh Capet. He conquers the city of Laon in northern France with support of his half-brother Arnulf (archbishop of Reims).
* Almanzor (Al-Mansur), &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Al-Andalus, continues his offensive against the kingdoms of León and Castile. King Bermudo II escapes to Zamora; the city resists for four days, but is finally sacked and captured.

==== China ====
* The Liao dynasty adopts civil service examinations in the &#x27;Southern Chancellery&#x27;, based on Tang dynasty models (approximate date).

=== By topic ===

==== Religion ====
* Grand Prince Vladimir the Great, ruler of Kievan Rus&#x27;, marries Anna Porphyrogenita (sister of Basil II) and converts to Christianity. He is baptized at Cherson in the Crimea, taking the Christian name of Basil (in honor of his brother-in-law). Vladimir returns in triumph to Kyiv, and begins the Christianization of Kievan Rus&#x27; to the Eastern Orthodox Church.
* The Mezhyhirskyi Monastery (located on the Dnieper River) is founded by Michael I, first metropolitan bishop of Kiev. He arrives with Greek monks from Constantinople.

==== Economy ====
* March 18 – The city of Odense (located on the island of Funen) in Denmark is founded. King Otto III grants trade rights and to the neighbouring settlements.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Ali ibn Ridwan, Arab physician and astrologer (d. 1061)
* Matilda of Swabia, German noblewoman (d. 1032)
* Minamoto no Yoriyoshi, Japanese nobleman (d. 1075)
* Nōin, Japanese monk and &quot;waka&quot; poet (d. 1051)
* Pang Ji, chancellor of the Song dynasty (d. 1063)
* Shōshi, empress consort of Japan (d. 1074)
* Stephen I, king of Croatia (approximate date)

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Europe ====
* Summer – Emperor Otto II (the Red) assembles an imperial expeditionary force at Taranto, and proceeds along the gulf coast towards Calabria. In the meantime, Emir Abu&#x27;l-Qasim (Kalbid) of the Emirate of Sicily declares a Holy War (&quot;jihad&quot;) against the Germans, but his forces retreat when he notices the unexpected strength of Otto&#x27;s troops (not far from Rossano).
* July 13 (or 14) – Battle of Stilo: Abu&#x27;l-Qasim is cornered by the imperial German forces led by Otto II at Cape Colonna (south of Crotone). After a violent clash, the German heavy cavalry destroys the Muslim centre, killing al-Qasim in the initial fighting. The Saracens hold together and draw Otto into a trap, encircling and defeating his forces (killing around 4,000 men).
* King Harald Bluetooth invades Norway, pillaging southwest Norway all the way to Stad, where he encounters Haakon Sigurdsson (the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Norway) and his army. He flees back to Denmark, ending the invasion.

==== Asia ====
* &#x27;Adud al-Dawla, emir (&quot;king of kings&quot;) of the Buyid Dynasty, concludes a 10-year peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire. He establishes what will soon become the most important hospital of Baghdad.
* The Indian Rashtrakuta Dynasty ends as its last ruler Indra IV commits &quot;Sallekhana&quot; (the Jain religious practice of voluntarily starving oneself to death).

<doc id="48029" wikidata="Q11093" url="?curid=48029" title="Valerie Solanas">
<text>Valerie Jean Solanas (April 9, 1936 – April 25, 1988) was an American radical feminist known for the &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot;, which she self-published in 1967, and her attempt to murder the artist Andy Warhol in 1968.

On June 3, 1968, Solanas went to the Factory, shot Warhol and the art critic Mario Amaya, and attempted to shoot Warhol&#x27;s manager, Fred Hughes. Solanas was charged with attempted murder, assault, and illegal possession of a firearm. After her release, she continued to promote the &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot;. She died in 1988 of pneumonia in San Francisco.

== Early life ==
Valerie Solanas was born in 1936 in Ventnor City, New Jersey, to Louis Solanas and Dorothy Marie Biondo. Her father was a bartender and her mother a dental assistant. She had a younger sister, Judith Arlene Solanas Martinez. Her father was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to parents who immigrated from Spain. Her mother was an Italian-American of Genoan and Sicilian descent born in Philadelphia.

Solanas alleged that her father regularly sexually abused her. Her parents divorced when she was young, and her mother remarried shortly afterwards. Solanas disliked her stepfather and began rebelling against her mother, becoming a truant. As a child, she wrote insults for children to use on one another, for the cost of a dime. She beat up a girl in high school who was bothering a younger boy, and also hit a nun.

Because of her rebellious behavior, Solanas&#x27; mother sent her to be raised by her grandparents in 1949. Solanas reported that her grandfather was a violent alcoholic who often beat her. When she was aged 15, she left her grandparents and became homeless. In 1953, Solanas gave birth to a son, fathered by a married sailor. The child, named David, was taken away and she never saw him again.

After high school, Solanas earned a degree in psychology from the University of Maryland, College Park, where she was in the Psi Chi Honor Society. While at the University of Maryland, she hosted a call-in radio show where she gave advice on how to combat men. Solanas was an open lesbian, despite the conservative cultural climate of the 1950s.

Solanas attended the University of Minnesota&#x27;s Graduate School of Psychology, where she worked in the animal research laboratory, before dropping out and moving to attend Berkeley for a few courses. It was during this time that she began writing the &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot;.

== New York City and the Factory ==
In the mid-1960s, Solanas moved to New York City and supported herself through begging and prostitution. In 1965, she wrote two works: an autobiographical short story, &quot;A Young Girl&#x27;s Primer on How to Attain the Leisure Class&quot;, and a play, &quot;Up Your Ass&quot;, about a young prostitute. According to James Martin Harding, the play is &quot;based on a plot about a woman who &#x27;is a man-hating hustler and panhandler&#x27; and who ... ends up killing a man.&quot; Harding describes it as more a &quot;provocation than ... a work of dramatic literature&quot; and &quot;rather adolescent and contrived&quot;. The short story was published in &quot;Cavalier&quot; magazine in July 1966. &quot;Up Your Ass&quot; remained unpublished until 2014.

In 1967, Solanas called pop artist Andy Warhol at his studio, the Factory, and asked him to produce &quot;Up Your Ass&quot;. According to Warhol, he thought the title was &quot;wonderful&quot; and he invited her to come over with it. He accepted the script for review, told Solanas it was &quot;well typed&quot;, and promised to read it. However, when he read the script he thought it was so pornographic that it must have been a police trap. Solanas later contacted Warhol about the script and when she was told that he had lost it, she started demanding money. She was staying at the Chelsea Hotel and told Warhol that she needed money for rent so he offered to pay her $25 to appear in his film &quot;I, a Man&quot; (1967).

In her role in &quot;I, a Man&quot;, Solanas leaves the film&#x27;s title character, played by Tom Baker, to fend for himself, explaining, &quot;I gotta go beat my meat&quot; as she exits the scene. She was satisfied with her experience working with Warhol and her performance in the film, and brought Maurice Girodias, the founder of Olympia Press, to see it. Girodias described her as being &quot;very relaxed and friendly with Warhol&quot;. Solanas also had a nonspeaking role in Warhol&#x27;s film &quot;Bike Boy&quot; (1967).

=== &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot; ===
In 1967, Solanas self-published her best-known work, the &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot;, a scathing critique of patriarchal culture. The manifesto&#x27;s opening words are:

Some authors have argued that the &quot;Manifesto&quot; is a parody and satirical work targeting patriarchy. According to Harding, Solanas described herself as &quot;a social propagandist&quot;, but she denied that the work was &quot;a put on&quot; and insisted that her intent was &quot;dead serious&quot;. The &quot;Manifesto&quot; has been translated into over a dozen languages and is excerpted in several feminist anthologies.

While living at the Chelsea Hotel, Solanas introduced herself to Girodias, a fellow resident of the hotel. In August 1967, Girodias and Solanas signed an informal contract stating that she would give Girodias her &quot;next writing, and other writings&quot;. In exchange, Girodias paid her $500. Solanas took this to mean that Girodias would own her work. She told Paul Morrissey that &quot;everything I write will be his. He&#x27;s done this to me ... He&#x27;s screwed me!&quot; Solanas intended to write a novel based on the &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot; and believed that a conspiracy was behind Warhol&#x27;s failure to return the &quot;Up Your Ass&quot; script. She suspected that he was coordinating with Girodias to steal her work.

=== Shooting ===
According to an unquoted source in &quot;The Outlaw Bible of American Literature&quot;, on June 3, 1968, at , Solanas reportedly arrived at the Hotel Chelsea and asked for Girodias at the desk, only to be told he was gone for the weekend. She remained at the hotel for three hours before heading to the Grove Press, where she asked for Barney Rosset, who was also not available. In her 2014 biography of Solanas, Breanne Fahs argues that it is unlikely that she appeared at the Chelsea Hotel looking for Girodias, speculating that Girodias may have fabricated the account in order to boost sales for the &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot;, which he had published.

Fahs states that &quot;the more likely story ... places Valerie at the Actors Studio at 432 West Forty-Fourth Street early that morning&quot;. Actress Sylvia Miles states that Solanas appeared at the Actors Studio looking for Lee Strasberg, asking to leave a copy of &quot;Up Your Ass&quot; for him. Miles said that Solanas &quot;had a different look, a bit tousled, like somebody whose appearance is the last thing on her mind&quot;. Miles told Solanas that Strasberg would not be in until the afternoon, accepted the script, and then &quot;shut the door because I knew she was trouble. I didn&#x27;t know what sort of trouble, but I knew she was trouble.&quot;

Fahs records that Solanas then traveled to producer Margo Feiden&#x27;s (then Margo Eden) residence in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, as she believed that Feiden would be willing to produce &quot;Up Your Ass&quot;. As related to Fahs, Solanas talked to Feiden for almost four hours, trying to convince her to produce the play and discussing her vision for a world without men. Throughout this time, Feiden repeatedly refused to produce the play. According to Feiden, Solanas then pulled out her gun, and when Feiden again refused to commit to producing the play, she responded, &quot;Yes, you will produce the play because I&#x27;ll shoot Andy Warhol and that will make me famous and the play famous, and then you&#x27;ll produce it.&quot; As she was leaving Feiden&#x27;s residence, Solanas handed Feiden a partial copy of an earlier draft of the play and other personal papers.

Fahs describes how Feiden then &quot;frantically called her local police precinct, Andy Warhol&#x27;s precinct, police headquarters in Lower Manhattan, and the offices of Mayor John Lindsay and Governor Nelson Rockefeller to report what happened and inform them that Solanas was on her way at that very moment to shoot Andy Warhol&quot;. In some instances, the police responded that &quot;You can&#x27;t arrest someone because you believe she is going to kill Andy Warhol&quot;, and even asked Feiden, &quot;Listen lady, how would you know what a real gun looked like?&quot; In a 2009 interview with James Barron of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Feiden said that she knew Solanas intended to kill Warhol, but could not prevent it. (A &quot;New York Times&quot; assistant Metro editor responded to an online comment regarding the story, saying that the &quot;Times&quot; &quot;does not present the account as definitive&quot;.)

Solanas proceeded to the Factory and waited outside. Morrissey arrived and asked her what she was doing there, and she replied, &quot;I&#x27;m waiting for Andy to get money.&quot; Morrissey tried to get rid of her by telling her that Warhol was not coming in that day, but she told him she would wait. At Solanas went up into the studio. Morrissey told her again that Warhol was not coming in and that she had to leave. She left but rode the elevator up and down until Warhol finally boarded it.

Solanas entered the Factory with Warhol, who complimented her on her appearance, as she was uncharacteristically wearing makeup. Morrissey told her to leave, threatening to &quot;beat the hell&quot; out of her and throw her out otherwise. The phone rang and Warhol answered while Morrissey went to the bathroom. While Warhol was on the phone, Solanas fired at him three times. Her first two shots missed, but the third went through his spleen, stomach, liver, esophagus, and lungs. She then shot art critic Mario Amaya in the hip. Solanas further tried to shoot Fred Hughes, Warhol&#x27;s manager, but her gun jammed. Hughes asked her to leave, which she did, leaving behind a paper bag with her address book on a table. Warhol was taken to Columbus–Mother Cabrini Hospital, where he underwent a successful five-hour operation.

Later that day, Solanas turned herself in to police, gave up her gun, and confessed to the shooting, telling an officer that Warhol &quot;had too much control in my life&quot;. She was fingerprinted and charged with felonious assault and possession of a deadly weapon. The next morning, the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; ran the front-page headline: &quot;Actress Shoots Andy Warhol&quot;. Solanas demanded a retraction of the statement that she was an actress. The &quot;Daily News&quot; changed the headline in its later edition and added a quote from Solanas stating, &quot;I&#x27;m a writer, not an actress.&quot;

At her arraignment in Manhattan Criminal Court, Solanas denied shooting Warhol because he would not produce her play but said &quot;it was for the opposite reason&quot;, that &quot;he has a legal claim on my works&quot;. She told the judge that &quot;it&#x27;s not often that I shoot somebody. I didn&#x27;t do it for nothing. Warhol had tied me up, lock, stock, and barrel. He was going to do something to me which would have ruined me.&quot; She declared that she wanted to represent herself and she insisted that she &quot;was right in what I did! I have nothing to regret!&quot; The judge struck Solanas&#x27; comments from the court record and had her admitted to Bellevue Hospital for psychiatric observation.

=== Trial ===

After a cursory evaluation, Solanas was declared mentally unstable and transferred to the prison ward of Elmhurst Hospital. She appeared at New York Supreme Court on June 13, 1968. Florynce Kennedy represented her and asked for a writ of , arguing that Solanas was being held inappropriately at Elmhurst. The judge denied the motion and Solanas returned to Elmhurst. On June 28, Solanas was indicted on charges of attempted murder, assault, and illegal possession of a firearm. She was declared &quot;incompetent&quot; in August and sent to Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. That same month, Olympia Press published the &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot; with essays by Girodias and Krassner.

In January 1969, Solanas underwent psychiatric evaluation and was diagnosed with chronic paranoid schizophrenia. In June, she was deemed fit to stand trial. She represented herself without an attorney and pleaded guilty to &quot;reckless assault with intent to harm&quot;. Solanas was sentenced to three years in prison, with one year of time served.

== Media response ==
The shooting of Warhol propelled Solanas into the public spotlight, prompting a flurry of commentary and opinions in the media. Robert Marmorstein, writing in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, declared that Solanas &quot;has dedicated the remainder of her life to the avowed purpose of eliminating every single male from the face of the earth&quot;. Norman Mailer called her the &quot;Robespierre of feminism&quot;. Historian Alice Echols writes that members of New York Radical Women knew &quot;next to nothing&quot; about Solanas until her 1968 shooting of Warhol, but that afterward, Solanas’s case became a among radical feminists, and &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot; became &quot;obligatory reading&quot;.

Ti-Grace Atkinson, the New York chapter president of the National Organization for Women (NOW), described Solanas as &quot;the first outstanding champion of women&#x27;s rights&quot; and &quot;a &#x27;heroine&#x27; of the feminist movement&quot;, and &quot;smuggled [her manifesto] ... out of the mental hospital where Solanas was confined&quot;. According to Betty Friedan, the NOW board rejected Atkinson&#x27;s statement. Atkinson left NOW and founded another feminist organization. According to Friedan, &quot;the media continued to treat Ti-Grace as a leader of the women&#x27;s movement, despite its repudiation of her&quot;. Kennedy, another NOW member, called Solanas &quot;one of the most important spokeswomen of the feminist movement.&quot;

English professor Dana Heller argued that Solanas was &quot;very much aware of feminist organizations and activism&quot;, but &quot;had no interest in participating in what she often described as &#x27;a civil disobedience luncheon club.&#x27;&quot; Heller also stated that Solanas could &quot;reject mainstream liberal feminism for its blind adherence to cultural codes of feminine politeness and decorum which the &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot; identifies as the source of women&#x27;s debased social status&quot;.

== Later life and death ==
After Solanas was released from the New York State Prison for Women in 1971, she stalked Warhol and others over the telephone. In November 1971, Solanas was arrested again for aggravated assault after threatening Barney Rosset, editor of &quot;Evergreen Review&quot;. She was subsequently institutionalized several times and then drifted into obscurity.

Solanas may have intended to write an eponymous autobiography. In a 1977 &quot;Village Voice&quot; interview, she announced a book with her name as the title. The book, possibly intended as a parody, was supposed to deal with the &quot;conspiracy&quot; that led to her imprisonment. In a corrective 1977 &quot;Village Voice&quot; interview, Solanas said the book would not be autobiographical other than a small portion and that it would be about many things, include proof of statements in the manifesto, and would &quot;deal intensively with the subject of bullshit&quot;, but she said nothing about parody.

In the mid-1970s, according to Heller, Solanas was &quot;apparently homeless&quot; in New York City, &quot;continued to defend her political beliefs and the &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot;&quot;, and &quot;actively promoted&quot; her new &quot;Manifesto&quot; revision. In the late 1980s, Ultra Violet tracked down Solanas in northern California and interviewed her over the phone. According to Ultra Violet, Solanas had changed her name to Onz Loh and stated that the August 1968 version of the &quot;Manifesto&quot; had many errors, unlike her own printed version of October 1967, and that the book had not sold well. Solanas said that until she was informed by Violet, she was unaware of Warhol&#x27;s death in 1987.
On April 25, 1988, at the age of 52, Valerie Solanas died of pneumonia at the Bristol Hotel in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco. A building superintendent at the hotel, not on duty that night, had a vague memory of Solanas: &quot;Once, he had to enter her room, and he saw her typing at her desk. There was a pile of typewritten pages beside her. What she was writing and what happened to the manuscript remain a mystery.&quot; Her mother burned all her belongings posthumously.

== Legacy ==
=== Popular culture ===
Composer Pauline Oliveros released &quot;To Valerie Solanas and Marilyn Monroe in Recognition of Their Desperation&quot; in 1970. In the work, Oliveros seeks to explore how, &quot;Both women seemed to be desperate and caught in the traps of inequality: Monroe needed to be recognized for her talent as an actress. Solanas wished to be supported for her own creative work.&quot;

Actress Lili Taylor played Solanas in the film &quot;I Shot Andy Warhol&quot; (1996), which focused on Solanas&#x27;s assassination attempt on Warhol (played by Jared Harris). Taylor won Special Recognition for Outstanding Performance at the Sundance Film Festival for her role. The film&#x27;s director, Mary Harron, requested permission to use songs by The Velvet Underground but was denied by Lou Reed, who feared that Solanas would be glorified in the film. Six years before the film&#x27;s release, Reed and John Cale included a song about Solanas, &quot;I Believe&quot;, on their concept album about Warhol, &quot;Songs for Drella&quot; (1990). In &quot;I Believe&quot;, Reed sings, &quot;I believe life&#x27;s serious enough for retribution ... I believe being sick is no excuse. And I believe I would&#x27;ve pulled the switch on her myself.&quot; Reed believed Solanas was to blame for Warhol&#x27;s death from a gallbladder infection twenty years after she shot him.

&quot;Up Your Ass&quot; was rediscovered in 1999 and produced in 2000 by George Coates Performance Works in San Francisco. The copy Warhol had lost was found in a trunk of lighting equipment owned by Billy Name. Coates learned about the rediscovered manuscript while at an exhibition at The Andy Warhol Museum marking the 30th anniversary of the shooting. Coates turned the piece into a musical with an all-female cast. Coates consulted with Solanas&#x27; sister, Judith, while writing the piece, and sought to create a &quot;very funny satirist&quot; out of Solanas, not just showing her as Warhol&#x27;s attempted assassin.

Solanas&#x27; life has inspired three plays. &quot;Valerie Shoots Andy&quot; (2001), by Carson Kreitzer, starred two actors playing a younger (Heather Grayson) and an older (Lynne McCollough) Solanas. &quot;Tragedy in Nine Lives&quot; (2003), by Karen Houppert, examined the encounter between Solanas and Warhol as a Greek tragedy and starred Juliana Francis as Solanas. In 2011, &quot;Pop!&quot;, a musical by Maggie-Kate Coleman and Anna K. Jacobs, focused mainly on Warhol (played by Tom Story). Rachel Zampelli played Solanas and sang &quot;Big Gun&quot;, described as the &quot;evening&#x27;s strongest number&quot; by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

Swedish author Sara Stridsberg wrote a semi-fictional novel about Solanas called (&#x27;The Dream Faculty&#x27;), published in 2006. The book&#x27;s narrator visits Solanas toward the end of her life at the Bristol Hotel. Stridsberg was awarded the Nordic Council&#x27;s Literature Prize for the book. The novel was later translated into and published in English under the title &quot;Valerie, or, The Faculty of Dreams: A Novel&quot; in 2019.

In 2006 Solanas was featured in eleventh episode of the second season Adult Swim show The Venture Bros as part of a group called The Groovy Gang. The group was a parody of the Scooby Gang from Scooby-Doo and was made up of parodies of Solanas (Velma), Ted Bundy (Fred), David Berkowitz (Shaggy), Patty Hearst (Daphne), and Groovy (Scooby). In the episode she is voiced by Joanna Adler. Most of her lines in the episode are quotes from the SCUM Manifesto.

Solanas was featured in a 2017 episode of the FX series &quot;American Horror Story: Cult&quot;, &quot;Valerie Solanas Died for Your Sins: Scumbag&quot;. She was played by Lena Dunham. The episode portrayed Solanas as the instigator of most of the Zodiac Killer murders.

=== Influence and analysis ===
Author James Martin Harding explained that, by declaring herself independent from Warhol, after her arrest she &quot;aligned herself with the historical avant-garde&#x27;s rejection of the traditional structures of bourgeois theater&quot;/ and that her anti-patriarchal &quot;militant hostility ... pushed the avant-garde in radically new directions&quot;. Harding believed that Solanas&#x27; assassination attempt on Warhol was its own theatrical performance. At the shooting, she left on a table at the Factory a paper bag containing a gun, her address book, and a sanitary napkin. Harding stated that leaving behind the sanitary napkin was part of the performance, and called &quot;attention to basic feminine experiences that were taboo and tacitly elided within avant-garde circles&quot;.

Feminist philosopher Avital Ronell compared Solanas to an array of people: Lorena Bobbitt, a &quot;girl Nietzsche&quot;, Medusa, the Unabomber, and Medea. Ronell believed that Solanas was threatened by the hyper-feminine women of the Factory that Warhol liked and felt lonely because of the rejection she felt due to her own butch androgyny. She believed Solanas was ahead of her time, living in a period before feminist and lesbian activists such as the Guerrilla Girls and the Lesbian Avengers.

Solanas has also been credited with instigating radical feminism. Catherine Lord wrote that &quot;the feminist movement would not have happened without Valerie Solanas&quot;. Lord believed that the reissuing of the &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot; and the disowning of Solanas by &quot;women&#x27;s liberation politicos&quot; triggered a wave of radical feminist publications. According to Vivian Gornick, many of the women&#x27;s liberation activists who initially distanced themselves from Solanas changed their minds a year later, developing the first wave of radical feminism. At the same time, perceptions of Warhol were transformed from largely nonpolitical into political martyrdom because the motive for the shooting was political, according to Harding and Victor Bockris. Solanas&#x27; idiosyncratic views on gender are a focus of Andrea Long Chu&#x27;s 2019 book, &quot;Females&quot;.

Fahs describes Solanas as a contradiction that &quot;alienates her from the feminist movement&quot;, arguing that Solanas never wanted to be &quot;in movement&quot; but nevertheless fractured the feminist movement by provoking NOW members to disagree about her case. Many contradictions are seen in Solanas&#x27; lifestyle as a lesbian who sexually serviced men, her claim to be asexual, a rejection of queer culture, and a non-interest in working with others despite a dependency on others. Fahs also brings into question the contradictory stories of Solanas&#x27; life. She is described as a victim, a rebel, and a desperate loner, yet her cousin says she worked as a waitress in her late 20s and 30s, not primarily as a prostitute, and friend Geoffrey LaGear said she had a &quot;groovy childhood&quot;. Solanas also kept in touch with her father throughout her life, despite claiming that he sexually abused her. Fahs believes that Solanas embraced these contradictions as a key part of her identity.

In 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; started a series of delayed obituaries of significant individuals whose importance the paper&#x27;s obituary writers had not recognized at the time of their deaths. In June 2020, they started a series of obituaries on LGBTQ individuals, and on June 26, they profiled Solanas.

<doc id="48030" wikidata="Q23380" url="?curid=48030" title="Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres">
<text>Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres ( ; ; 29 August 1780 – 14 January 1867) was a French Neoclassical painter. Ingres was profoundly influenced by past artistic traditions and aspired to become the guardian of academic orthodoxy against the ascendant Romantic style. Although he considered himself a painter of history in the tradition of Nicolas Poussin and Jacques-Louis David, it is his portraits, both painted and drawn, that are recognized as his greatest legacy. His expressive distortions of form and space made him an important precursor of modern art, influencing Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, and other modernists.

Born into a modest family in Montauban, he travelled to Paris to study in the studio of David. In 1802 he made his Salon debut, and won the for his painting &quot;The Ambassadors of Agamemnon in the tent of Achilles&quot;. By the time he departed in 1806 for his residency in Rome, his style—revealing his close study of Italian and Flemish Renaissance masters—was fully developed, and would change little for the rest of his life. While working in Rome and subsequently Florence from 1806 to 1824, he regularly sent paintings to the Paris Salon, where they were faulted by critics who found his style bizarre and archaic. He received few commissions during this period for the history paintings he aspired to paint, but was able to support himself and his wife as a portrait painter and draughtsman.

He was finally recognized at the Salon in 1824, when his Raphaelesque painting, &quot;The Vow of Louis XIII&quot;, was met with acclaim, and Ingres was acknowledged as the leader of the Neoclassical school in France. Although the income from commissions for history paintings allowed him to paint fewer portraits, his &quot;Portrait of Monsieur Bertin&quot; marked his next popular success in 1833. The following year, his indignation at the harsh criticism of his ambitious composition &quot;The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian&quot; caused him to return to Italy, where he assumed directorship of the French Academy in Rome in 1835. He returned to Paris for good in 1841. In his later years he painted new versions of many of his earlier compositions, a series of designs for stained glass windows, several important portraits of women, and &quot;The Turkish Bath&quot;, the last of his several Orientalist paintings of the female nude, which he finished at the age of 83.

==Early years: Montauban and Toulouse==
Ingres was born in Montauban, Tarn-et-Garonne, France, the first of seven children (five of whom survived infancy) of (1755–1814) and his wife Anne Moulet (1758–1817). His father was a successful jack-of-all-trades in the arts, a painter of miniatures, sculptor, decorative stonemason, and amateur musician; his mother was the nearly illiterate daughter of a master wigmaker. From his father the young Ingres received early encouragement and instruction in drawing and music, and his first known drawing, a study after an antique cast, was made in 1789. Starting in 1786, he attended the local school École des Frères de l&#x27;Éducation Chrétienne, but his education was disrupted by the turmoil of the French Revolution, and the closing of the school in 1791 marked the end of his conventional education. The deficiency in his schooling would always remain for him a source of insecurity.

In 1791, Joseph Ingres took his son to Toulouse, where the young Jean-Auguste-Dominique was enrolled in the Académie Royale de Peinture, Sculpture et Architecture. There he studied under the sculptor Jean-Pierre Vigan, the landscape painter Jean Briant, and the neoclassical painter Guillaume-Joseph Roques. Roques&#x27; veneration of Raphael was a decisive influence on the young artist. Ingres won prizes in several disciplines, such as composition, &quot;figure and antique&quot;, and life studies. His musical talent was developed under the tutelage of the violinist Lejeune, and from the ages of thirteen to sixteen he played second violin in the Orchestre du Capitole de Toulouse.

From an early age he was determined to be a history painter, which, in the hierarchy of genres established by the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture under Louis XIV, and continued well into the 19th Century, was considered the highest level of painting. He did not want to simply make portraits or illustrations of real life like his father; he wanted to represent the heroes of religion, history and mythology, to idealize them and show them in ways that explained their actions, rivaling the best works of literature and philosophy.

==In Paris (1797–1806)==

In March 1797, the Academy awarded Ingres first prize in drawing, and in August he traveled to Paris to study in the studio of Jacques-Louis David, France&#x27;s—and Europe&#x27;s—leading painter during the revolutionary period, in whose studio he remained for four years. Ingres followed his master&#x27;s neoclassical example. In 1797 David was working on his enormous masterpiece, &quot;The Intervention of the Sabine Women&quot;, and was gradually modifying his style away from Roman models of rigorous realism to the ideals of purity, virtue and simplicity in Greek art. 

One of the other students of David, Étienne-Jean Delécluze, who later became an art critic, described Ingres as a student: He was distinguished not just by the candor of his character and his disposition to work alone ... he was one of the most studious ... he took little part in the all the turbulent follies around him, and he studied with more perseverance than most of his co-disciples ... All of the qualities which characterize today the talent of this artist, the finesse of contour, the true and profound sentiment of the form, and a modeling with extraordinary correctness and firmness, could already be seen in his early studies. While several of his comrades and David himself signaled a tendency toward exaggeration in his studies, everyone was struck by his grand compositions and recognized his talent. He was admitted to the painting department of the École des Beaux-Arts in October 1799. In 1800 and 1801, he won the grand prize for figure painting for his paintings of male torsos. 

In 1800 and 1801, he competed for the Prix de Rome, the highest prize of the Academy, which entitled the winner to four years of residence at the French Academy in Rome. He came in second in his first attempt, but in 1801 he took the top prize with &quot;The Ambassadors of Agamemnon in the tent of Achilles&quot;. The figures of the envoys, in the right of the painting, are muscular and solid as statues, in the style taught by David, but the two main figures on the left, Achilles and Patroclus, are mobile, vivid and graceful, like figures in a delicate bas-relief.

His residence in Rome was postponed until 1806 due to shortage of state funds. In the meantime he worked in Paris alongside several other students of David in a studio provided by the state, and further developed a style that emphasized purity of contour. He found inspiration in the works of Raphael, in Etruscan vase paintings, and in the outline engravings of the English artist John Flaxman. His drawings of Hermaphrodite and the Nymph Salmacis showed a new stylized ideal of female beauty, which would reappear later in his &quot;Jupiter et Thetis&quot; and his famous nudes.

In 1802 he made his debut at the Salon with &quot;Portrait of a Woman&quot; (the current whereabouts of which is unknown). Between 1804 and 1806 he painted a series of portraits which were striking for their extreme precision, particularly in the richness of their fabrics and tiny details. These included the &quot;Portrait of Philipbert Riviére&quot; (1805), &quot;Portrait of Sabine Rivière&quot; (1805–06), &quot;Portrait of Madame Aymon&quot; (also known as &quot;La Belle Zélie&quot;; 1806), and &quot;Portrait of Caroline Rivière&quot; (1805–06). The female faces were not at all detailed but were softened, and were notable for their large oval eyes and delicate flesh colours and their rather dreamlike expressions. His portraits typically had simple backgrounds of solid dark or light colour, or of sky. These were the beginning of a series that would make him among the most celebrated portrait artists of the 19th century.

As Ingres waited to depart to Rome, his friend Lorenzo Bartolini introduced him to Italian Renaissance paintings, particularly the works of Bronzino and Pontormo, which Napoleon had brought back from his campaign in Italy and placed in the Louvre. Ingres assimilated their clarity and monumentality into his own portrait style. In the Louvre were also masterpieces of Flemish art, including the &quot;Ghent Altarpiece&quot; by Jan van Eyck, which the French army had seized during its conquest of Flanders. The precision of Renaissance Flemish art became part of Ingres&#x27;s style. Ingres&#x27;s stylistic eclecticism represented a new tendency in art. The Louvre, newly filled with booty seized by Napoleon in his campaigns in Italy and the Low Countries, provided French artists of the early 19th century with an unprecedented opportunity to study, compare, and copy masterworks from antiquity and from the entire history of European painting. As art historian Marjorie Cohn has written: &quot;At the time, art history as a scholarly enquiry was brand-new. Artists and critics outdid each other in their attempts to identify, interpret, and exploit what they were just beginning to perceive as historical stylistic developments.&quot; From the beginning of his career, Ingres freely borrowed from earlier art, adopting the historical style appropriate to his subject, and was consequently accused by critics of plundering the past.

In 1803 he received a prestigious commission, being one of five artists selected (along with Jean-Baptiste Greuze, Robert Lefèvre, Charles Meynier, and Marie-Guillemine Benoist) to paint full-length portraits of Napoleon Bonaparte as First Consul. These were to be distributed to the prefectural towns of Liège, Antwerp, Dunkerque, Brussels, and Ghent, all of which were newly ceded to France in the 1801 Treaty of Lunéville. Napoleon is not known to have granted the artists a sitting, and Ingres&#x27;s meticulously painted portrait of &quot;Bonaparte, First Consul&quot; appears to be modelled on an image of Napoleon painted by Antoine-Jean Gros in 1802.

In the summer of 1806, Ingres became engaged to Marie-Anne-Julie Forestier, a painter and musician, before leaving for Rome in September. Although he had hoped to stay in Paris long enough to witness the opening of that year&#x27;s Salon, in which he was to display several works, he reluctantly left for Italy just days before the opening.

Ingres painted a new portrait of Napoleon for presentation at the Salon of 1806, this one showing Napoleon on the Imperial Throne for his coronation. This painting was entirely different from his earlier portrait of Napoleon as First Consul; it concentrated almost entirely on the lavish imperial costume that Napoleon had chosen to wear, and the symbols of power he held. The scepter of Charles V, the sword of Charlemagne the rich fabrics, furs and capes, crown of gold leaves, golden chains and emblems were all presented in extremely precise detail; the Emperor&#x27;s face and hands were almost lost in the majestic costume.

At the Salon, his paintings—&quot;Self-Portrait&quot;, portraits of the Rivière family, and &quot;Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne&quot;—received a very chilly reception. David delivered a severe judgement, and the critics were hostile. Chaussard (&quot;Le Pausanias Français&quot;, 1806) praised &quot;the fineness of Ingres&#x27;s brushwork and the finish&quot;, but condemned Ingres&#x27;s style as gothic and asked: How, with so much talent, a line so flawless, an attention to detail so thorough, has M. Ingres succeeded in painting a bad picture? The answer is that he wanted to do something singular, something extraordinary ... M. Ingres&#x27;s intention is nothing less than to make art regress by four centuries, to carry us back to its infancy, to revive the manner of Jean de Bruges.

==Rome and the French Academy (1806–1814)==
Newly arrived in Rome, Ingres read with mounting indignation the relentlessly negative press clippings sent to him from Paris by his friends. In letters to his prospective father-in-law, he expressed his outrage at the critics: &quot;So the Salon is the scene of my disgrace; ... The scoundrels, they waited until I was away to assassinate my reputation ... I have never been so unhappy...I knew I had many enemies; I never was agreeable with them and never will be. My greatest wish would be to fly to the Salon and to confound them with my works, which don&#x27;t in any way resemble theirs; and the more I advance, the less their work will resemble mine.&quot; He vowed never again to exhibit at the Salon, and his refusal to return to Paris led to the breaking up of his engagement. Julie Forestier, when asked years later why she had never married, responded, &quot;When one has had the honor of being engaged to M. Ingres, one does not marry.&quot;

On 23 November 1806, he wrote to Jean Forestier, the father of his former fiancée, &quot;Yes, art will need to be reformed, and I intend to be that revolutionary.&quot; Characteristically, he found a studio on the grounds of the Villa Medici away from the other resident artists, and painted furiously. Many drawings of monuments in Rome from this time are attributed to Ingres, but it appears from more recent scholarship that they were actually the work of his collaborators, particularly his friend the landscape artist François-Marius Granet. As required of every winner of the &quot;Prix&quot;, he sent works at regular intervals to Paris so his progress could be judged. Traditionally fellows sent paintings of male Greek or Roman heroes, but for his first samples Ingres sent &quot;Baigneuse à mi-corps&quot; (1807), a painting of the back of a young woman bathing, based on an engraving of an antique vase, and &quot;La Grande Bagneuse&quot; (1808), a larger painting of the back of a nude bather, and the first Ingres model to wear a turban, a detail he borrowed from the Fornarina by his favourite painter, Raphael. To satisfy the Academy in Paris, he also dispatched &quot;Oedipus and the Sphinx&quot; to show his mastery of the male nude. The verdict of the academicians in Paris was that the figures were not sufficiently idealized. In later years Ingres painted several variants of these compositions; another nude begun in 1807, the &quot;Venus Anadyomene&quot;, remained in an unfinished state for decades, to be completed forty years later and finally exhibited in 1855.
During his time in Rome he also painted numerous portraits: &quot;Madame Duvaucey&quot; (1807), &quot;François-Marius Granet&quot; (1807), &quot;Joseph-Antoine Moltedo&quot; (1810), &quot;Madame Panckoucke&quot; (1811), and &quot;Charles-Joseph-Laurent Cordier&quot; (1811). In 1812 he painted one of his few portraits of an older woman, &quot;Comtesse de Tournon&quot;, mother of the prefect of Rome. In 1810 Ingres&#x27;s pension at the Villa Medici ended, but he decided to stay in Rome and seek patronage from the French occupation government.

In 1811 Ingres completed his final student exercise, the immense &quot;Jupiter and Thetis&quot;, a scene from the Iliad of Homer: the goddess of the Sea, Thetis, pleads with Zeus to act in favor of her son Achilles. The face of the water nymph Salmacis he had drawn years earlier reappeared as Thetis. Ingres wrote with enthusiasm that he had been planning to paint this subject since 1806, and he intended to &quot;deploy all of the luxury of art in its beauty&quot;. However, once again, the critics were hostile, finding fault with the exaggerated proportions of the figures and the painting&#x27;s flat, airless quality.

Although facing uncertain prospects, in 1813 Ingres married a young woman, Madeleine Chapelle, recommended to him by her friends in Rome. After a courtship carried out through correspondence, he proposed without having met her, and she accepted. Their marriage was happy; Madame Ingres&#x27;s faith was unwavering. He continued to suffer disparaging reviews, as &quot;Don Pedro of Toledo Kissing Henry IV&#x27;s Sword&quot;, &quot;Raphael and the Fornarina&quot; (Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University), several portraits, and the &quot;Interior of the Sistine Chapel&quot; met with generally hostile critical response at the Paris Salon of 1814.

==Rome after the Academy and Florence (1814–1824)==
After he left the Academy, a few important commissions came to him. The French governor of Rome, General Miollis, a wealthy patron of the arts, asked him to decorate rooms of the Monte Cavallo Palace, a former papal residence, for an expected visit of Napoleon. Ingres painted a large-scale &quot;Romulus&#x27; Victory Over Acron&quot; (1811) for the salon of the Empress and &quot;The Dream of Ossian&quot; (1813), based on a book of poems that Napoleon admired, for the ceiling of the Emperor&#x27;s bedroom. General Miollis also commissioned Ingres to paint &quot;Virgil reading The Aeneid before Augustus, Livia and Octavia&quot; (1812) for his own residence, the villa Aldobrandini. The painting shows the moment when Virgil, reciting his work to the Emperor Augustus, his wife Livia and his sister Octavia, mentions the name of Octavia&#x27;s dead son, Marcellus, causing Octavia to faint. The interior was precisely depicted, following the archeological finds at Pompeii. As usual, Ingres made several versions of the same scene: a three-figure fragment cut from an abandoned version is in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels, and in 1825 he made a chalk drawing in vertical format as a model for a reproductive engraving made by Pradier in 1832. The General Miollis version was repurchased by Ingres in the 1830s, reworked by assistants under Ingres&#x27;s direction, and never finished; &quot;The Dream of Ossian&quot; was likewise repurchased, modified, but left unfinished.

He traveled to Naples in the spring of 1814 to paint &quot;Queen Caroline Murat&quot;. Joachim Murat, the King of Naples, had earlier purchased the Dormeuse de Naples, a sleeping nude (the original is lost, but several drawings exist, and Ingres later revisited the subject in &quot;L&#x27;Odalisque à l&#x27;esclave&quot;). Murat also commissioned two historical paintings, &quot;Raphael et la Fornarina&quot; and &quot;Paolo et Francesca&quot;, and what later became one of Ingres&#x27;s most famous works, &quot;La Grande Odalisque&quot;, to accompany &quot;Dormeuse de Naples&quot;. Ingres never received payment, due to the collapse of the Murat regime and execution of Joachim Murat in 1815. With the fall of Napoleon&#x27;s dynasty, he found himself essentially stranded in Rome without patronage.

He continued to produce masterful portraits, in pencil and oils, of almost photographic precision; but with the departure of the French administration, the painting commissions were rare. During this low point of his career, Ingres augmented his income by drawing pencil portraits of the many wealthy tourists, in particular the English, passing through postwar Rome. For an artist who aspired to a reputation as a history painter, this seemed menial work, and to the visitors who knocked on his door asking, &quot;Is this where the man who draws the little portraits lives?&quot;, he would answer with irritation, &quot;No, the man who lives here is a painter!&quot; The portrait drawings he produced in such profusion during this period rank today among his most admired works. He is estimated to have made some five hundred portrait drawings, including portraits of his famous friends. His friends included many musicians including Paganini, and he regularly played the violin with others who shared his enthusiasm for Mozart, Haydn, Gluck, and Beethoven.

He also produced a series of small paintings in what was known as the Troubador style, idealized portrayals of events in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In 1815 he painted &quot;Aretino and Charles V&#x27;s Ambassador&quot; as well as &quot;Aretino and Tintoretto&quot;, an anecdotal painting whose subject, a painter brandishing a pistol at his critic, may have been especially satisfying to the embattled Ingres. Other paintings in the same style included &quot;Henry IV Playing with His Children&quot; (1817) and the &quot;Death of Leonardo.&quot;
In 1816 Ingres produced his only etching, a portrait of the French ambassador to Rome, Monsignor Gabriel Cortois de Pressigny. The only other prints he is known to have executed are two lithographs: &quot;The Four Magistrates of Besançon&quot;, made as an illustration for Baron Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Voyages pittoresques et romantiques dans l&#x27;ancienne France&quot;, and a copy of &quot;La Grande Odalisque&quot;, both in 1825.

In 1817 the Count of Blacas, who was ambassador of France to the Holy See, provided Ingres with his first official commission since 1814, for a painting of &quot;Christ Giving the Keys to Peter&quot;. Completed in 1820, this imposing work was well received in Rome but to the artist&#x27;s chagrin the ecclesiastical authorities there would not permit it to be sent to Paris for exhibition.

A commission came in 1816 or 1817 from the descendants of the Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alva, for a painting of the Duke receiving papal honours for his repression of the Protestant Reformation. Ingres loathed the subject—he regarded the Duke as one of history&#x27;s brutes—and struggled to satisfy both the commission and his conscience. After revisions which eventually reduced the Duke to a tiny figure in the background, Ingres left the work unfinished. He entered in his diary, &quot;J&#x27;etais forcé par la necessité de peindre un pareil tableau; Dieu a voulu qu&#x27;il reste en ebauche.&quot; (&quot;I was forced by need to paint such a painting; God wanted it to remain a sketch.&quot;)
He continued to send works to the Salon in Paris, hoping to make his breakthrough there. In 1819 he sent his reclining nude, &quot;La Grande Odalisque&quot;, as well as a history painting, &quot;Philip V and the Marshal of Berwick&quot;, and &quot;Roger Freeing Angelica&quot;, based on an episode in the 16th-century epic poem &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; by Ariosto but his work was once again condemned by critics as gothic and unnatural. The critic Kératy complained that the Grande Odalisque&#x27;s back was three vertebrae too long. The critic Charles Landon wrote: &quot;After a moment of attention, one sees that in this figure there are no bones, no muscles, no blood, no life, no relief, no anything which constitutes imitation...it is evident that the artist deliberately erred, that he wanted to do it badly, that he believed in bringing back to life the pure and primitive manner of the painters of Antiquity; but he took for his model a few fragments from earlier periods and a degenerate execution, and completely lost his way.&quot;

In 1820 Ingres and his wife moved to Florence at the urging of the Florentine sculptor Lorenzo Bartolini, an old friend from his years in Paris. He still had to depend upon his portraits and drawings for income, but his luck began to change. His history painting &quot;Roger Freeing Angelica&quot; was purchased for the private collection of Louis XVIII, and was hung in the Musée du Luxembourg in Paris, which was newly devoted to the work of living artists. This was the first work of Ingres to enter a museum.
In 1821, he finished a painting commissioned by a childhood friend, Monsieur de Pastoret, &quot;The Entry into Paris of the Dauphin, the Future Charles V&quot;; de Pastoret also ordered a portrait of himself and a religious work (&quot;Virgin with the Blue Veil&quot;). In August 1820, with the help of de Pastoret, he received a commission for a major religious painting for the Cathedral of Montauban. The theme was the re-establishment of the bond between the church and the state. Ingres&#x27;s painting, &quot;The Vow of Louis XIII&quot; (1824), inspired by Raphael, was purely in the Renaissance style, and depicted King Louis XIII vowing to dedicate his reign to the Virgin Mary. This was perfectly in tune with the doctrine of the new government of the Restoration. He spent four years bringing the large canvas to completion, and he took it to the Paris Salon in October 1824, where it became the key that finally opened the door of the Paris art establishment and to his career as an official painter.

==Return to Paris and retreat to Rome (1824–1834)==

The &quot;Vow of Louis XIII&quot; in the Salon of 1824 finally brought Ingres critical success. Although Stendhal complained about &quot;the sort of material beauty which excludes the idea of divinity&quot;, most critics praised the work. The journalist and future Prime Minister and French President Adolphe Thiers celebrated the breakthrough of a new style: &quot;Nothing is better than variety like this, the essential character of the new style.&quot; In January 1825 Ingres was awarded the Cross of the Légion d&#x27;honneur by Charles X, and in June 1825 he was elected a member of Académie des Beaux-Arts. Lithographs of &quot;La Grande Odalisque&quot; published in 1826 in two competing versions by Delpech and Sudré found eager buyers; Ingres received 24,000 francs for the reproduction rights – twenty times the amount he had been paid for the original painting six years earlier. The 1824 Salon also brought forward a counter-current to the neoclassicism of Ingres: Eugène Delacroix exhibited &quot;Les Massacres de Scio&quot;, in a romantic style sharply contrasting to that of Ingres.

The success of Ingres&#x27;s painting led in 1826 to a major new commission, &quot;The Apotheosis of Homer&quot;, a giant canvas which celebrated all the great artists of history, intended to decorate the ceiling of one of the halls of the Museum Charles X at the Louvre. Ingres was unable to finish the work in time for the 1827 Salon, but displayed the painting in grisaille. The 1827 Salon became a confrontation between the neoclassicism of Ingres&#x27;s &quot;Apotheosis&quot; and a new manifesto of romanticism by Delacroix, &quot;The Death of Sardanapalus&quot;. Ingres joined the battle with enthusiasm; he called Delacroix &quot;the apostle of ugliness&quot; and told friends that he recognized &quot;the talent, the honorable character and distinguished spirit&quot; of Delacroix, but that &quot;he has tendencies which I believe are dangerous and which I must push back.&quot;

Despite the considerable patronage he enjoyed under the Bourbon government, Ingres welcomed the July Revolution of 1830. That the outcome of the Revolution was not a republic but a constitutional monarchy was satisfactory to the essentially conservative and pacifistic artist, who in a letter to a friend in August 1830 criticized agitators who &quot;still want to soil and disturb the order and happiness of a freedom so gloriously, so divinely won.&quot; Ingres&#x27;s career was little affected, and he continued to receive official commissions and honors under the July Monarchy.

Ingres exhibited in the Salon of 1833, where his portrait of &quot;Louis-François Bertin&quot; (1832) was a particular success. The public found its realism spellbinding, although some of the critics declared its naturalism vulgar and its colouring drab. In 1834 he finished a large religious painting, &quot;The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian&quot;, which depicted the first saint to be martyred in Gaul. The painting was commissioned in 1824 by the Ministry of the Interior for the Cathedral of Autun, and the iconography in the picture was specified by the bishop. Ingres conceived the painting as the summation of all of his work and skill, and worked on it for ten years before displaying it at the Salon of 1834. He was surprised, shocked and angered by the response; the painting was attacked by both the neoclassicists and by the romantics. Ingres was accused of historical inaccuracy, for the colours, and for the feminine appearance of the Saint, who looked like a beautiful statue. In anger, Ingres announced that he would no longer accept public commissions, and that he would no longer participate in the Salon. He later did participate in some semi-public expositions and a retrospective of his work at the 1855 Paris International Exposition, but never again took part in the Salon or submitted his work for public judgement. Instead, at the end of 1834 he returned to Rome to become the Director of the Academy of France.

==Director of the French Academy in Rome (1834–1841)==
Ingres remained in Rome for six years. He devoted much of his attention to the training of the painting students, as he was later to do at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He re-organized the Academy, increased the size of the library, added many molds of classical statues to the Academy collection, and assisted the students in getting public commissions in both Rome and Paris. He traveled to Orvieto (1835), Siena (1835), and to Ravenna and Urbino to study the paleochristian mosaics, medieval murals and Renaissance art. He devoted considerable attention to music, one of the subjects of the academy; he welcomed Franz Liszt and Fanny Mendelssohn. He formed a long friendship with Liszt. Composer Charles Gounod, who was a pensioner at the time at the Academy, described Ingres&#x27;s appreciation of modern music, including Weber and Berlioz, and his adoration for Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart and Gluck. He joined the music students and his friend Niccolò Paganini in playing Beethoven&#x27;s violin works. Gounod wrote that Ingres &quot;had the tenderness of an infant and the indignation of an apostle.&quot; When Stendhal visited the Academy and disparaged Beethoven, Ingres turned to the doorman, indicated Stendhal, and told him, &quot;If this gentleman ever calls again, I am not here.&quot;

His rancor against the Paris art establishment for his failure at the 1834 Salon did not abate. In 1836 he refused a major commission from the French Minister of the Interior, Adolphe Thiers, to decorate the interior of the Church of the Madeleine in Paris, because the commission had been offered first to a rival, Paul Delaroche, who refused it. He did complete a small number of works which he sent to patrons in Paris. One was &quot;L&#x27;Odalisque et l&#x27;esclave&quot;, (1839), a portrait of a blonde odalisque, or member of a harem, who reclines languorously while a turbaned musician plays. This fitted into the popular genre of orientalism; his rival Eugène Delacroix had created a painting on a similar theme, &quot;Les Femmes d&#x27;Alger&quot;, for the 1834 Salon. The setting was inspired by Persian miniatures and was full of exotic detail, but the woman&#x27;s long reclining form was pure Ingres. The critic Théophile Gautier wrote of Ingres&#x27;s work: &quot;It is impossible to better paint the mystery, the silence and the suffocating atmosphere of the seraglio.&quot; In 1842 he painted a second version, nearly identical to the first but with a landscape background (painted by his student Paul Flandrin).
The second painting he sent, in 1840, was &quot;The Illness of Antiochus&quot; (1840; also known as &quot;Aniochus and Stratonice&quot;) a history painting on a theme of love and sacrifice, a theme once painted by David in 1800, when Ingres was in his studio. It was commissioned by the Duc d&#x27;Orleans, the son of King Louis Philippe I), and had very elaborate architectural background designed by one of the Academy students, Victor Baltard, the future architect of the Paris market Les Halles. The central figure was an ethereal woman in white, whose contemplative pose with her hand on her chin recurs in some of Ingres&#x27;s female portraits.

His painting of Aniochius and Stratonice, despite its small size, just one meter, was a major success for Ingres. In August it was shown in the private apartment of the duc d&#x27;Orléans in the Pavilion Marsan of the Palais des Tuileries. The King greeted him personally at Versailles and gave him a tour of the Palace. He was offered a commission to paint a portrait of the Duke, the heir to the throne, and another from the Duc de Lunyes to create two huge murals for the Château de Dampierre. In April 1841 he returned definitively to Paris.

==Last years (1841–1867)==
One of the first works executed after his return to Paris was a portrait of the duc d&#x27;Orléans. After the heir to the throne was killed in a carriage accident a few months after the painting was completed in 1842, Ingres received commissions to make additional copies. He also received a commission to design seventeen stained glass windows for the chapel on the place where the accident occurred, and a commission for eight additional stained-glass designs for Orléans chapel in Dreux. He became a professor at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He took his students frequently to the Louvre to the see the classical and Renaissance art, instructing them to look straight ahead and to avoid the works of Rubens, which he believed deviated too far from the true values of art.

The Revolution of 1848, which overthrew Louis Philippe and created the French Second Republic, had little effect on his work or his ideas. He declared that the revolutionaries were &quot;cannibals who called themselves French&quot;, but during the Revolution completed his &quot;Venus Anadyomene&quot;, which he had started as an academic study in 1808. It represented Venus, rising from the sea which had given birth to her, surrounded by cherubs. He welcomed the patronage of the new government of Louis-Napoleon, who in 1852 became Emperor Napoleon III.

In 1843 Ingres began the decorations of the great hall in the Château de Dampierre with two large murals, the &quot;Golden Age&quot; and the &quot;Iron Age&quot;, illustrating the origins of art. He made more than five hundred preparatory drawings, and worked on the enormous project for six years. In an attempt to imitate the effect of Renaissance frescos, he chose to paint the murals in oil on plaster, which created technical difficulties. Work on the &quot;Iron Age&quot; never progressed beyond the architectural background painted by an assistant. Meanwhile, the growing crowd of nudes in the &quot;Golden Age&quot; discomfited Ingres&#x27;s patron, the Duc de Luynes, and Ingres suspended work on the mural in 1847. Ingres was devastated by the loss of his wife, who died on 27 July 1849, and he was finally unable to complete the work. In July 1851, he announced a gift of his artwork to his native city of Montauban, and in October he resigned as professor at the École des Beaux-Arts.

However, in 1852, Ingres, then seventy-one years of age, married forty-three-year-old Delphine Ramel, a relative of his friend Marcotte d&#x27;Argenteuil. Ingres was rejuvenated, and in the decade that followed he completed several significant works, including the portrait of &quot;Princesse Albert de Broglie, née Joséphine-Eléonore-Marie-Pauline de Galard de Brassac de Béarn&quot;. In 1853 he began the &quot;Apotheosis of Napoleon I&quot;, for the ceiling of a hall in the Hôtel de Ville, Paris. (It was destroyed in May 1871 when the Paris Commune set fire to the building.) With the help of assistants, in 1854 he completed another history painting, &quot;Joan of Arc at the Coronation of Charles VII&quot;. A retrospective of his works was featured at the Paris Universal Exposition of 1855, and in the same year Napoleon III named him a Grand Officer of the Légion d&#x27;honneur. In 1862 he was awarded the title of Senator, and made a member of the Imperial Council on Public Instruction. Three of his works were shown in the London International Exhibition, and his reputation as a major French painter was confirmed once more.

He continued to rework and refine his classic themes. In 1856 Ingres completed &quot;The Source&quot; (The Spring), a painting begun in 1820 and closely related to his &quot;Venus Anadyoméne&quot;. He painted two versions of &quot;Louis XIV and Molière&quot; (1857 and 1860), and produced variant copies of several of his earlier compositions. These included religious works in which the figure of the Virgin from &quot;The Vow of Louis XIII&quot; was reprised: &quot;The Virgin of the Adoption&quot; of 1858 (painted for Mademoiselle Roland-Gosselin) was followed by &quot;The Virgin Crowned&quot; (painted for Madame la Baronne de Larinthie) and &quot;The Virgin with Child&quot;. In 1859 he produced new versions of &quot;The Virgin of the Host&quot;, and in 1862 he completed &quot;Christ and the Doctors&quot;, a work commissioned many years before by Queen Marie Amalie for the chapel of Bizy. He painted small replicas of &quot;Paolo and Francesca&quot; and &quot;Oedipus and the Sphinx&quot;. In 1862 he completed a small oil-on-paper version of &quot;The Golden Age&quot;. The last of his important portrait paintings date from this period: &quot;Marie-Clothilde-Inés de Foucauld, Madame Moitessier, Seated&quot; (1856), &quot;Self-Portrait at the Age of Seventy-eight&quot; and &quot;Madame J.-A.-D. Ingres, née Delphine Ramel&quot;, both completed in 1859. At the request of the Uffizi Gallery of Florence, he made his own-self portrait in 1858. The only colour in the painting is the red of his rosette of the Legion of Honour.

Near the end of his life, he made one of his best-known masterpieces, &quot;The Turkish Bath&quot;. It reprised a figure and theme he had been painting since 1828, with his &quot;Petite Baigneuse&quot;. Originally completed in a square format in 1852 and sold to Prince Napoleon in 1859, it was returned to the artist soon afterward—according to a legend, Princess Clothilde was shocked by the abundant nudity. After reworking the painting as a &quot;tondo&quot;, Ingres signed and dated it in 1862, although he made additional revisions in 1863. The painting was eventually purchased by a Turkish diplomat, Khalid Bey, who owned a large collection of nudes and erotic art, including several paintings by Courbet. The painting continued to cause a scandal long after Ingres was dead. It was initially offered to the Louvre in 1907, but was rejected, before being given to the Louvre in 1911.

Ingres died of pneumonia on 14 January 1867, at the age of eighty-six, in his apartment on the Quai Voltaire in Paris. He is interred in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris with a tomb sculpted by his student Jean-Marie Bonnassieux. The contents of his studio, including a number of major paintings, over 4000 drawings, and his violin, were bequeathed by the artist to the city museum of Montauban, now known as the Musée Ingres.
==Style==
Ingres&#x27;s style was formed early in life and changed comparatively little. His earliest drawings, such as the &quot;Portrait of a Man&quot; (or &quot;Portrait of an unknown&quot;, 3 July 1797, now in the Louvre) already show a suavity of outline and an extraordinary control of the parallel hatchings which model the forms. From the first, his paintings are characterized by a firmness of outline reflecting his often-quoted conviction that &quot;drawing is the probity of art&quot;. He believed colour to be no more than an accessory to drawing, explaining: &quot;Drawing is not just reproducing contours, it is not just the line; drawing is also the expression, the inner form, the composition, the modelling. See what is left after that. Drawing is seven eighths of what makes up painting.&quot;

The art historian Jean Clay said Ingres &quot;proceeded always from certitude to certitude, with the result that even his freest sketches reveal the same kind of execution as that found in the final works.&quot; In depicting the human body he disregarded rules of anatomy—which he termed a &quot;dreadful science that I cannot think of without disgust&quot;—in his quest for a sinuous arabesque. Abhorring the visible brushstroke, Ingres made no recourse to the shifting effects of colour and light on which the Romantic school depended; he preferred local colours only faintly modelled in light by half tones. &quot;Ce que l&#x27;on sait,&quot; he would repeat, &quot;il faut le savoir l&#x27;épée à la main.&quot; (&quot;Whatever you know, you must know it with sword in hand.&quot;) Ingres thus left himself without the means of producing the necessary unity of effect when dealing with crowded compositions, such as the &quot;Apotheosis of Homer&quot; and the &quot;Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian&quot;. Among Ingres&#x27;s historical and mythological paintings, the most satisfactory are usually those depicting one or two figures, such as &quot;Oedipus&quot;, &quot;The Half-Length Bather&quot;, &quot;Odalisque&quot;, and &quot;The Spring&quot;, subjects only animated by the consciousness of perfect physical well-being.

In &quot;Roger Freeing Angelica&quot;, the female nude seems merely juxtaposed with the meticulously rendered but inert figure of Roger flying to the rescue on his hippogriff, for Ingres was rarely successful in the depiction of movement and drama. According to Sanford Schwartz, the &quot;historical, mythological, and religious pictures bespeak huge amounts of energy and industry, but, conveying little palpable sense of inner tension, are costume dramas ... The faces in the history pictures are essentially those of models waiting for the session to be over. When an emotion is to be expressed, it comes across stridently, or woodenly.&quot;

Ingres was averse to theories, and his allegiance to classicism—with its emphasis on the ideal, the generalized, and the regular—was tempered by his love of the particular. He believed that &quot;the secret of beauty has to be found through truth. The ancients did not create, they did not make; they recognized.&quot; In many of Ingres&#x27;s works there is a collision between the idealized and the particular that creates what Robert Rosenblum termed an &quot;oil-and-water sensation&quot;. This contradiction is vivid in &quot;Cherubini and the Muse of Lyric Poetry&quot; (1842), for example, in which the realistically painted 81-year-old composer is attended by an idealized muse in classical drapery.

Ingres&#x27;s choice of subjects reflected his literary tastes, which were severely limited: he read and reread Homer, Virgil, Plutarch, Dante, histories, and the lives of the artists. Throughout his life he revisited a small number of favourite themes, and painted multiple versions of many of his major compositions. He did not share his age&#x27;s enthusiasm for battle scenes, and generally preferred to depict &quot;moments of revelation or intimate decision manifested by meeting or confrontation, but never by violence.&quot; His numerous odalisque paintings were influenced to a great extent by the writings of Mary Wortley Montagu, the wife of the ambassador to Turkey whose diaries and letters, when published, fascinated European society.

Although capable of painting quickly, he often laboured for years over a painting. Ingres&#x27;s pupil Amaury-Duval wrote of him: &quot;With this facility of execution, one has trouble explaining why Ingres&#x27; oeuvre is not still larger, but he scraped out [his work] frequently, never being satisfied ... and perhaps this facility itself made him rework whatever dissatisfied him, certain that he had the power to repair the fault, and quickly, too.&quot; Ingres&#x27;s &quot;Venus Anadyomene&quot; was begun in 1807 but not completed until 1848, after a long hiatus resulting from his indecision about the position of the arms. &quot;The Source&quot; (1856) had a similar history. It was begun in the 1820s as a sketch of &quot;such simplicity that one would suppose she had been painted in a single stroke&quot; according to Amaury-Duval, who believed that Ingres&#x27; reworking of the painting in 1855 was a loss.

===Portraits===
While Ingres believed that history painting was the highest form of art, his modern reputation rests largely upon the exceptional quality of his portraits. By the time of his retrospective at the Exposition Universelle in 1855, an emerging consensus viewed his portrait paintings as his masterpieces. Their consistently high quality belies Ingres&#x27;s often-stated complaint that the demands of portraiture robbed him of time he could have spent painting historical subjects. Baudelaire called him &quot;the sole man in France who truly makes portraits. The portraits of M. Bertin, M. Molé and Mme d&#x27;Haussonville are true portraits, that is, the ideal reconstruction of individuals...A good portrait seems to me always as a biography dramatized.&quot; His most famous portrait is that of Louis-François Bertin, the chief editor of the &quot;Journal des Debats&quot;, which was widely admired when it was exhibited at the 1833 Salon. Ingres had originally planned to paint Bertin standing, but many hours of effort ended in a creative impasse before he decided on a seated pose. Édouard Manet described the resulting portrait as &quot;The Buddha of the Bourgeoisie&quot;. The portrait quickly became a symbol of the rising economic and political power of Bertin&#x27;s social class.

For his female portraits, he often posed the subject after a classical statue; the famous portrait of the Comtesse de&#x27;Haussonville may have been modeled after a Roman statue called &quot;Pudicity&quot; (&quot;modesty&quot;) in the Vatican collection. Another trick that Ingres used was to paint the fabrics and details in the portraits with extreme precision and accuracy, but to idealize the face. The eye of the viewer would perceive the fabrics as realistic and would assume the face was equally true. His portraits of women range from the warmly sensuous &quot;Madame de Senonnes&quot; (1814) to the realistic &quot;Mademoiselle Jeanne Gonin&quot; (1821), the Junoesque &quot;Marie-Clothilde-Inés de Foucauld, Madame Moitessier&quot; (portrayed standing and seated, 1851 and 1856), and the chilly &quot;Joséphine-Eléonore-Marie-Pauline de Galard de Brassac de Béarn, Princesse de Broglie&quot; (1853).

===Drawings===
Drawing was the foundation of Ingres&#x27;s art. In the Ecole des Beaux-Arts he excelled at figure drawing, winning the top prizes. During his years in Rome and Florence, he made hundreds of drawings of family, friends, and visitors, many of them of very high portrait quality. He never began a painting without first resolving the drawing, usually with a long series of drawing in which he refined the composition. In the case of his large history paintings, each figure in the painting was the subject of numerous sketches and studies as he tried different poses. He demanded that his students at the Academy and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts perfect their drawing before anything else; he declared that a &quot;thing well drawn is always a thing well painted&quot;.
His portrait drawings, of which about 450 are extant, are today among his most admired works. While a disproportionate number of them date from his difficult early years in Italy, he continued to produce portrait drawings of his friends until the end of his life. Agnes Mongan has written of the portrait drawings:Before his departure in the fall of 1806 from Paris for Rome, the familiar characteristics of his drawing style were well established, the delicate yet firm contour, the definite yet discreet distortions of form, the almost uncanny capacity to seize a likeness in the precise yet lively delineation of features.The preferred materials were also already established: the sharply pointed graphite pencil on a smooth white paper. So familiar to us are both the materials and the manner that we forget how extraordinary they must have seemed at the time ... Ingres&#x27; manner of drawing was as new as the century. It was immediately recognized as expert and admirable. If his paintings were sternly criticized as &quot;Gothic,&quot; no comparable criticism was leveled at his drawings.

His student Raymond Balze described Ingres&#x27;s working routine in executing his portrait drawings, each of which required four hours, as &quot;an hour and a half in the morning, then two-and-a-half hours in the afternoon, he very rarely retouched it the next day. He often told me that he got the essence of the portrait while lunching with the model who, off guard, became more natural.&quot; The resulting drawings, according to John Canaday, revealed the sitters&#x27; personalities by means so subtle—and so free of cruelty—that Ingres could &quot;expose the vanities of a fop, a silly woman, or a windbag, in drawings that delighted them.&quot;

Ingres drew his portrait drawings on wove paper, which provided a smooth surface very different from the ribbed surface of laid paper (which is, nevertheless, sometimes referred to today as &quot;Ingres paper&quot;). The early drawings are characterized by very taut contours drawn with sharply pointed graphite, while later drawings show freer lines and more emphatic modeling, drawn with a softer, blunter graphite.

Drawings made in preparation for paintings, such as the many studies for &quot;The Martyrdom of St. Symphorian&quot; and &quot;The Golden Age&quot;, are more varied in size and treatment than are the portrait drawings. It was his usual practice to make many drawings of nude models, in search of the most eloquent gesture, before making another series of drawings for the draperies. In his early years he sometimes had his model pose behind a translucent veil that suppressed details and emphasized the arabesque. He often used female models when testing poses for male figures, as he did in drawings for &quot;Jesus Among the Doctors&quot;. Nude studies exist even for some of his commissioned portraits, but these were drawn using hired models.

Ingres drew a number of landscape views while in Rome, but he painted only one pure landscape, the small tondo &quot;Raphael&#x27;s Casino&quot; (although two other small landscape tondos are sometimes attributed to him).

===Colour===
For Ingres, colour played an entirely secondary role in art. He wrote, &quot;Colour adds ornament to a painting; but it is nothing but the handmaiden, because all it does is to render more agreeable the true perfections of the art. Rubens and Van Dyck can be pleasing at first sight, but they are deceptive; they are from the poor school of colourists, the school of deception. Never use bright colours, they are anti-historic. It is better to fall into gray than to into bright colours.&quot; The Institute in Paris complained in 1838 that the students of Ingres in Rome &quot;had a deplorable lack of knowledge of the truth and power of colour, and a knowledge of the different effects of light. A dull and opaque effect is found in all their canvases. They seem to have only been lit by twilight.&quot; The poet and critic Baudelaire observed: &quot;the students of M. Ingres have very uselessly avoided any semblance of colour; they believe or pretend to believe that they are not needed in painting.&quot;

Ingres&#x27;s own paintings vary considerably in their use of colour, and critics were apt to fault them as too grey or, contrarily, too jarring. Baudelaire—who said &quot;M. Ingres adores colour like a fashionable milliner&quot;—wrote of the portraits of Louis-François Bertin and Madame d&#x27;Haussonville: &quot;Open your eyes, nation of simpletons, and tell us if you ever saw such dazzling, eye-catching painting, or even a greater elaboration of colour&quot;. Ingres&#x27;s paintings are often characterized by strong local colours, such as the &quot;acid blues and bottle greens&quot; Kenneth Clark professed to &quot;perversely enjoy&quot; in &quot;La Grande Odalisque&quot;. In other works, especially in his less formal portraits such as the &quot;Mademoiselle Jeanne-Suzanne-Catherine Gonin&quot; (1821), colour is restrained.

==Ingres and Delacroix==
Ingres and Delacroix became, in the mid-19th century, the most prominent representatives of the two competing schools of art in France, neoclassicism and romanticism. Neo-classicism was based in large part on the philosophy of Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717–1768), who wrote that art should embody &quot;noble simplicity and calm grandeur&quot;. Many painters followed this course, including François Gérard, Antoine-Jean Gros, Anne-Louis Girodet, and Jacques-Louis David, the teacher of Ingres. A competing school, romanticism, emerged first in Germany, and moved quickly to France. It rejected the idea of the imitation of classical styles, which it described as &quot;gothic&quot; and &quot;primitive&quot;. The Romanticists in French painting were led by Théodore Géricault and especially Delacroix. The rivalry first emerged at the Paris Salon of 1824, where Ingres exhibited &quot;The Vow of Louis XIII&quot;, inspired by Raphael, while Delacroix showed &quot;The Massacre at Chios&quot;, depicting a tragic event in the Greek War of Independence. Ingres&#x27;s painting was calm, static and carefully constructed, while the work of Delacroix was turbulent, full of motion, colour, and emotion.

The dispute between the two painters and schools reappeared at the 1827 Salon, where Ingres presented &quot;L&#x27;Apotheose d&#x27;Homer&quot;, an example of classical balance and harmony, while Delacroix showed &quot;The Death of Sardanapalus&quot;, another glittering and tumultuous scene of violence. The duel between the two painters, each considered the best of his school, continued over the years. Paris artists and intellectuals were passionately divided by the conflict, although modern art historians tend to regard Ingres and other Neoclassicists as embodying the Romantic spirit of their time.

At the 1855 Universal Exposition, both Delacroix and Ingres were well represented. The supporters of Delacroix and the romantics heaped abuse on the work of Ingres. The Brothers Goncourt described &quot;the miserly talent&quot; of Ingres: &quot;Faced with history, M. Ingres calls vainly to his assistance a certain wisdom, decency, convenience, correction and a reasonable dose of the spiritual elevation that a graduate of a college demands. He scatters persons around the center of the action ... tosses here and there an arm, a leg, a head perfectly drawn, and thinks that his job is done...&quot;

Baudelaire also, previously sympathetic toward Ingres, shifted toward Delacroix. &quot;M. Ingres can be considered a man gifted with high qualities, an eloquent evoker of beauty, but deprived of the energetic temperament which creates the fatality of genius.&quot;

Delacroix himself was merciless toward Ingres. Describing the exhibition of works by Ingres at the 1855 Exposition, he called it &quot;ridiculous ... presented, as one knows, in a rather pompous fashion ... It is the complete expression of an incomplete intelligence; effort and pretension are everywhere; nowhere is there found a spark of the natural.&quot;

According to Ingres&#x27; student Paul Chenavard, later in their careers, Ingres and Delacroix accidentally met on the steps of the French Institute; Ingres put his hand out, and the two shook amicably.

==Pupils==
Ingres was a conscientious teacher and was greatly admired by his students. The best known of them is Théodore Chassériau, who studied with him from 1830, as a precocious eleven-year-old, until Ingres closed his studio in 1834 to return to Rome. Ingres considered Chassériau his truest disciple—even predicting, according to an early biographer, that he would be &quot;the Napoleon of painting&quot;. 

By the time Chassériau visited Ingres in Rome in 1840, however, the younger artist&#x27;s growing allegiance to the romantic style of Delacroix was apparent, leading Ingres to disown his favourite student, of whom he subsequently spoke rarely and censoriously. No other artist who studied under Ingres succeeded in establishing a strong identity; among the most notable of them were Jean-Hippolyte Flandrin, Henri Lehmann, and Eugène Emmanuel Amaury-Duval.

==Influence on modern art==
Ingres&#x27;s influence on later generations of artists was considerable. One of his heirs was Degas, who studied under Louis Lamothe, a minor disciple of Ingres. In the 20th century, his influence was even stronger. Picasso and Matisse were among those who acknowledged a debt to Ingres; Matisse described him as the first painter &quot;to use pure colours, outlining them without distorting them.&quot; The startling effects of Ingres&#x27;s paintings—the collapsing of traditional depth and perspective and the presentation of figures &quot;like the figures in a deck of cards&quot;—were criticized in the 19th century but were welcomed by the avant-garde in the 20th century.
An important retrospective of works by Ingres was held at the Salon d&#x27;automne in Paris in 1905, which was visited by Picasso, Matisse, and many other artists. The original and striking composition of &quot;The Turkish Bath&quot;, shown for the first time in public, had a visible influence on the composition and poses of the figures in Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Les Demoiselles d&#x27;Avignon&quot; in 1907. The exhibit also included many of his studies for the unfinished mural &quot;l&#x27;Age d&#x27;or&quot;, including a striking drawing of women gracefully dancing in a circle. Matisse produced his own version on this composition in his painting &quot;La Danse&quot; in 1909. The particular pose and colouring of Ingres&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Monsieur Bertin&quot; also made a reappearance in Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Gertrude Stein&quot; (1906).

Barnett Newman credited Ingres as a progenitor of abstract expressionism, explaining: &quot;That guy was an abstract painter ... He looked at the canvas more often than at the model. Kline, de Kooning—none of us would have existed without him.&quot;

Pierre Barousse, the curator of the Musée Ingres, wrote: ...One realizes in how many ways a variety of artists claim him as their master, from the most plainly conventional of the nineteenth century such as Cabanel or Bouguereau, to the most revolutionary of our century from Matisse to Picasso. A classicist? Above all, he was moved by the impulse to penetrate the secret of natural beauty and to reinterpret it through its own means; an attitude fundamentally different to that of David ... there results a truly personal and unique art admired as much by the Cubists for its plastic autonomy, as by the Surrealists for its visionary qualities.

Ingres is one of the most cited artists in the interpictural compositions of the Peruvian painter Herman Braun-Vega. The latter dedicated an entire exhibition to him in 2006 on the occasion of the year dedicated to Ingres in France museums.

==&quot;Violon d&#x27;Ingres&quot;==
Ingres&#x27;s well-known passion for playing the violin gave rise to a common expression in the French language, &quot;violon d&#x27;Ingres&quot;, meaning a second skill beyond the one by which a person is mainly known.

Ingres was an amateur violin player from his youth, and played for a time as second violinist for the orchestra of Toulouse. When he was Director of the French Academy in Rome, he played frequently with the music students and guest artists. Charles Gounod, who was a student under Ingres at the Academy, merely noted that &quot;he was not a professional, even less a virtuoso&quot;. Along with the student musicians, he performed Beethoven string quartets with Niccolò Paganini. In an 1839 letter, Franz Liszt described his playing as &quot;charming&quot;, and planned to play through all the Mozart and Beethoven violin sonatas with Ingres. Liszt also dedicated his transcriptions of the 5th and 6th symphonies of Beethoven to Ingres on their original publication in 1840.

The American avant-garde artist Man Ray used this expression as the title of a famous photograph portraying Alice Prin (aka Kiki de Montparnasse) in the pose of the &quot;Valpinçon Bather&quot; with two f-holes painted on to make her body resemble a violin.

<doc id="48034" wikidata="Q295859" url="?curid=48034" title="Anzac Day">
<text>Anzac Day is a national day of remembrance in Australia, New Zealand and Tonga that broadly commemorates all Australians and New Zealanders &quot;who served and died in all wars, conflicts, and peacekeeping operations&quot; and &quot;the contribution and suffering of all those who have served&quot;. Observed on 25 April each year, Anzac Day was originally devised to honour the members of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) who served in the Gallipoli campaign, their first engagement in the First World War (1914–1918).

==History==
Anzac Day marks the anniversary of the first campaign that led to major casualties for Australian and New Zealand forces during the First World War. The acronym ANZAC stands for Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, whose soldiers were known as Anzacs. Anzac Day remains one of the most important national occasions of both Australia and New Zealand; however, the ceremonies and their meanings have changed significantly since 1915. According to Martin Crotty, a historian at the University of Queensland, Anzac commemorations have &quot;suited political purposes right from 1916 when the first Anzac Day march was held in London and Australia, which were very much around trying to get more people to sign up to the war in 1916–1918&quot;.

===Gallipoli campaign, 1915===

In 1915, Australian and New Zealand soldiers formed part of an Allied expedition that set out to capture the Gallipoli Peninsula in the Ottoman Empire to open the way to the Black Sea for the Allied navies. The objective was to capture Constantinople, the capital of the Ottoman Empire, which was a member of the Central Powers during the war. The ANZAC force landed at Gallipoli on 25 April, meeting fierce resistance from the Ottoman Army commanded by Mustafa Kemal (later known as Atatürk). What had been planned as a bold strike to knock the Ottomans out of the war quickly became a stalemate, and the campaign dragged on for eight months. At the end of 1915, the Allied forces were evacuated after both sides had suffered heavy casualties and endured great hardships. The Allied deaths totalled over 56,000, including 8,709 from Australia and 2,721 from New Zealand. News of the landing at Gallipoli made a profound impact on Australians and New Zealanders at home and 25 April quickly became the day on which they remembered the sacrifice of those who had died in the war.

Though the Gallipoli campaign failed to achieve its military objectives of capturing Constantinople and knocking the Ottoman Empire out of the war, the actions of the Australian and New Zealand troops during the campaign bequeathed an intangible but powerful legacy. The creation of what became known as an Anzac legend became an important part of the national identity in both countries. This has shaped the way their citizens have viewed both their past and their understanding of the present. The heroism of the soldiers in the failed Gallipoli campaign made their sacrifices iconic in New Zealand memory, and is often credited with securing the psychological independence of the nation.

===From 1915 to World War II===
On 30 April 1915, when the first news of the landing reached New Zealand, a half-day holiday was declared and impromptu services were held.

Adelaide, South Australia, was the site of Australia&#x27;s first built memorial to the Gallipoli landing, unveiled by Governor-General Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson on Wattle Day, 7 September 1915, just over four months after the first landings. The monument was originally the centrepiece of the Wattle Day League&#x27;s Gallipoli Memorial Wattle Grove on Sir Lewis Cohen Avenue in the South Park Lands. The original native pines and remnant seedlings of the original wattles still grow in Wattle Grove, but in 1940 the Adelaide City Council moved the monument and its surrounding pergola a short distance away to Lundie Gardens. Also in South Australia, Eight Hour Day, 13 October 1915, was renamed Anzac Day and a carnival was organised to raise money for the Wounded Soldiers Fund. The name Anzac Day was chosen through a competition, won by Robert Wheeler, a draper of Prospect.

Melbourne observed an Anzac Remembrance Day on 17 December 1915.

Anniversary commemorations started in Queensland. On 10 January 1916, Canon David John Garland was appointed the honorary secretary of the Anzac Day Commemoration Committee of Queensland (ADCCQ) at a public meeting which endorsed 25 April as the date to be promoted as &quot;Anzac Day&quot; in 1916 and ever after. Queensland Premier T.J. Ryan urged the other Australian states to enact a similar parade, and soon the date became a national day of reflection. Devoted to the cause of a non-denominational commemoration that could be attended by the whole of Australian society, Garland worked amicably across all denominational divides, creating the framework for Anzac Day commemorative services. Garland is specifically credited with initiating the Anzac Day march, the wreath-laying ceremonies at memorials and the special church services, the two minutes silence, and the luncheon for returned soldiers. Garland intended the silence to be used in lieu of a prayer to allow the Anzac Day service to be universally attended, allowing attendees to make a silent prayer or remembrance in accordance with their own beliefs. He particularly feared that the universality of the ceremony would fall victim to religious sectarian disputes. The State Library of Queensland holds the minutes from the Anzac Day Commemoration Committee of Queensland; the collection has been digitised and available to view online. In 2019, the collection was added to UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World Australian Register.

The date 25 April was officially named Anzac Day in 1916; in that year, it was marked by a wide variety of ceremonies and services in Australia, New Zealand and London. In New Zealand, it was as a half-day holiday. Over 2,000 people attended the service in Rotorua. In London, over 2,000 Australian and New Zealand troops marched through the streets of the city. An unnamed London newspaper reputedly dubbed them &quot;The Knights of Gallipoli&quot;. Marches were held all over Australia; wounded soldiers from Gallipoli attended the Sydney march in convoys of cars, accompanied by nurses.

In Egypt, General John Monash paraded the troops on Anzac Day 1916.

For the remaining years of the war, Anzac Day was used as an occasion for patriotic rallies and recruiting campaigns, and marches of serving members of the AIF were held in most cities. From 1916 onwards, in both Australia and New Zealand, Anzac memorials were held on or about 25 April, mainly organised by returned servicemen and school children in cooperation with local authorities. Early morning services were solemn, with a more upbeat tone set for honouring returned soldiers during afternoon activities.

Australian troops did not return to great victory parades at the end of the war. This was partly because their arrival home depended on available shipping, but also because of the influenza epidemic of 1919, which prevented people assembling in large numbers. The 1919 Sydney parade was cancelled as a result, but a public commemorative service was held in the Domain, where participants were required to wear masks and stand three feet apart.

Anzac Day was gazetted as a public holiday in New Zealand in 1920, through the Anzac Day Act, after lobbying by the New Zealand Returned Services&#x27; Association, the RSA.

In Australia at the 1921 State Premiers&#x27; Conference, it was decided that Anzac Day would be observed on 25 April each year. However, it was not observed uniformly in all the states until 1922 when the States were invited to co-operate with the Commonwealth in observing the day, and an invitation was telegraphed to the various religious bodies suggesting that memorial services be held in the morning.
In the early 1920s returned soldiers mostly commemorated Anzac Day informally, primarily as a means of keeping in contact with each other. But as time passed and they inevitably began to drift apart, the ex-soldiers perceived a need for an institutionalised reunion. During the late 1920s, Anzac Day became established as a National Day of Commemoration for the 60,000 Australians and 18,000 New Zealanders who died during the war. The first year in which all the Australian states observed some form of public holiday together on Anzac Day was 1927. By the mid-1930s, all the rituals now associated with the daydawn vigils, marches, memorial services, reunions, two-up gamesbecame part of Australian Anzac Day culture. New Zealand commemorations also adopted many of these rituals, with the dawn service being introduced from Australia in 1939.

===Changes after World War II===
With the coming of the Second World War, Anzac Day became a day on which to commemorate the lives of Australians and New Zealanders which were lost in that war as well and in subsequent wars. The meaning of the day has been further broadened to include those killed in all the military operations in which the countries have been involved. Anzac Day was first commemorated at the Australian War Memorial in 1942, but, due to government orders preventing large public gatherings in case of Japanese air attack, it was a small affair and was neither a march nor a memorial service. Anzac Day has been annually commemorated at the Australian War Memorial ever since. In New Zealand, Anzac Day saw a surge in popularity immediately after World War II.

===Decline in popularity===
By the 1950s, many New Zealanders had become antagonistic or indifferent towards the day. Much of this was linked to the legal ban on commerce on Anzac Day, and the banning by many local authorities of sports events and other entertainment on the day. Annoyance was particularly pronounced in 1953 and 1959, when Anzac Day fell on a Saturday. There was widespread public debate on the issue, with some people calling for the public holiday to be moved to the nearest Sunday or abolished altogether. In 1966, a new &quot;Anzac Day Act&quot; was passed, allowing sport and entertainment in the afternoon.

During and after Australia&#x27;s involvement in the Vietnam War (1962–1975), interest in Anzac Day reached its lowest point in Australia. On 26 April 1975, &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper covered the passing of Anzac Day in a single story. In the 1960s and 1970s, anti-war protesters used Anzac Day events as a platform to voice opposition to conscription and Australia&#x27;s military involvement in general; in the following 20 years, the relevance of Australia&#x27;s war connection with the British Empire was brought into question. In 1967, two members of the left-wing Progressive Youth Movement in Christchurch staged a minor protest at the Anzac Day ceremony, laying a wreath protesting against the Vietnam War. They were subsequently convicted of disorderly conduct. In 1978, a women&#x27;s group laid a wreath dedicated to all the women raped and killed during war, and movements for feminism, gay rights, and peace used the occasion to draw attention to their respective causes at various times during the 1980s. In 1981, the group Women Against Rape in War marched up Anzac Parade towards the Australian War Memorial to lay their wreath at the Stone of Remembrance. At the head of the procession, women held a banner which read, &quot;In memory of all women of all countries raped in all wars.&quot; More than 60 women were arrested by police. Following this time, there were calls for a new type of comradeship that did not discriminate based on sex or race.

===1990s–2010s: Revival===
However, since the late 1980s and especially the 1990s, interest in and attendance at Anzac Day has grown. On 25 April 1990, Bob Hawke became the first Australian politician to visit Gallipoli, and he also decided that government would pay to take Anzac veterans to Gallipoli for the 75th anniversary of the dawn landing. This is seen by historians as a major milestone in the recovery of Anzac Day.

Prime Minister John Howard was also a huge proponent of Anzac Day commemorations, and visited Gallipoli on 25 April in both 2000 and 2005.

An increasing number of attendees have been young Australians, many of whom attend ceremonies swathed in Australian flags, wearing green and gold T-shirts and beanies and with Australian flag tattoos imprinted on their skin. This phenomenon has been perceived by some as a reflection of the desire of younger generations of Australians to honour the sacrifices made by the previous generations.
Australians and New Zealanders recognise 25 April as a ceremonial occasion to reflect on the cost of war and to remember those who fought and died in war. Commemorative services and marches are held at dawn, the time of the original landing, mainly at war memorials in cities and towns across both nations and the sites of some of Australia and New Zealand&#x27;s more-recognised battles and greatest losses, such as Villers-Bretonneux in France and Gallipoli in Turkey.

One of the traditions of Anzac Day is the gunfire breakfast (coffee with rum added) which occurs shortly after many dawn ceremonies, and recalls the &quot;breakfast&quot; taken by many soldiers before facing battle. Later in the day, ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen meet and join in marches through the major cities and many smaller centres.

In 2018, female veterans were encouraged to march at the front of their sections. The &quot;By The Left&quot; initiative was launched following a number of reported cases where servicewomen had been challenged that they were wearing their medals on the wrong side, as people should wear their own medals on the left side of their chest, but people marching in place of their parents or other ancestors should wear that person&#x27;s medals on the right side.

According to historian Carolyn Holbrook of Deakin University, &quot;We reached Peak Anzac in 2015 sure, and there has been some backing off since then, but in terms of the dawn services and Anzac Day commemoration, it will remain huge for a good while yet... There is nothing better to take its place in terms of a national mythology.&quot;

In recent years, there has been greater recognition of the often overlooked role that women, immigrants and Indigenous Australians played in the wars, in the news and in the arts. &quot;Black Diggers&quot;, which premiered at the Sydney Festival, told the stories of the Aboriginal men who enlisted, whose sacrifices were ignored, and who were quickly forgotten upon their return. Country Arts SA&#x27;s &quot;Aboriginal Diggers Project&quot; is a 3-year project (2017–2019) capturing the stories and experiences of Aboriginal servicemen and women who have served in Australia&#x27;s Military from the Boer War to the present day through film, theatre and visual arts.

=== 2020–2022: COVID-19 pandemic===
;2020
In 2020, most Anzac Day marches in Australia and New Zealand were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a consequence of the cancellation of the service, two Army veterans, Bill Sowry and Terry James, suggested standing in front of the driveways to observe a minute of silence; and, at the same time, Justin Wilbur, the son of a Vietnam veteran, offered to light a candle as a tribute to the soldiers. He created a Facebook group &quot;Aussies and Kiwis for ANZACS&quot;, and Ashleigh Leckie, a Navy veteran, combined their ideas and put forth what we now know as the &quot;Driveway at Dawn&quot; movement. This movement was later adopted by the RSL and RSA and was consequently renamed &quot;Light up the Dawn&quot; and &quot;Stand at Dawn&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, Kathy Lette presented a Zoom performance of &quot;The One Day of the Year&quot; with five actors performing from their homes.

;2021
In 2021 major state marches occurred although under pandemic restriction settings such as in Queensland and the Northern Territory, others with ticketing and/or restrictions on numbers marching and watching, such as the national event in Canberra, Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania. Overseas services were not held. Services did not happen in Perth as on 24 April Perth city and the Peel region entered a sudden 3 day COVID-19 lockdown and Anzac Day services in the affected areas were cancelled.

;2022
In 2022 dawn services returned in both Australia and in Gallipoli. The end of pandemic restriction meant crowds returned to pre-pandemic levels in Queensland New South Wales South Australia, Victoria, The ACT, Tasmania and the Northern Territory where Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Deputy Opposition Leader Richard Marles (representing Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese who was sick with COVID at the time) attended a dawn service. Perth saw the return of the dawn service for the first time in three years albeit with only 500 attendees due to ongoing COVID restrictions. Dawn services occurred in New Zealand but parades were cancelled due to the pandemic.

=== Post-pandemic: 2023–present ===
30,000 attended the Canberra war memorial service in 2023, continuing a trend since 2015 of declining crowds.

=== 2024 ===

In 2024 in New South Wales it was proposed to change Anzac Day from a half-holiday to a full day, with many big supermarkets forced to stay closed for the whole day. Small cafes, newsagents and petrol stations can remain open. The Returned Services League (RSL), which represents serving and returned defence force people, is a strong supporter of this change.

==As a public holiday==
ANZAC Day is a public holiday in Australia, New Zealand and Tonga (including in the dependencies of Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the Cook Islands, Niue, Norfolk Island and Tokelau).

==Dawn service and commemoration in Australia==

===Dawn service===

A dawn service was held on the Western Front by an Australian battalion on the first anniversary of the Gallipoli landing on 25 April 1916, and historians agree that in Australia dawn services spontaneously popped up around the country to commemorate the fallen at Gallipoli in the years after this. The timing of the dawn service is based on the time that the ANZAC forces started the landing on the Gallipoli peninsula, but also has origins in a combination of military, symbolic and religious traditions. Various stories name different towns as having the first ever service in Australia, including Albany, Western Australia, but no definite proof has been found to corroborate any of them. In Rockhampton, Queensland on 26 April 1916, over 600 people attended an interdenominational service that started at 6.30 am. However, the dawn service held at the Sydney Cenotaph in 1928 can lay claim to being the first of a continuous tradition. The 1931 service at the Cenotaph was the first attended by the Governor and representatives of state and federal governments.

Dawn services were originally very simple and in many cases they were restricted to veterans only, to remember and reflect among the comrades with whom they shared a special bond. Before dawn the gathered veterans would be ordered to stand-to and a lone bugler would play the &quot;Last Post&quot;. Two minutes of silence would follow, concluded with the &quot;Reveille&quot;. In more recent times the families of veterans and the general public have been encouraged to take part in dawn services. Some of the ceremonies have also become more elaborate, incorporating hymns, prayer readings, laying of wreaths, laments and the playing of the Australian national anthem, but others have retained the simple format of the dawn stand-to. The fourth stanza of Laurence Binyon&#x27;s poem &quot;&quot; (known as the &quot;Ode of Remembrance&quot;, or simply as &quot;the Ode&quot;) is often recited.
===Commemorative services and traditions===
Despite federation being proclaimed in Australia in 1901, it is argued that the national identity of Australia was largely forged during the violent conflict of World War I, and the most iconic event in the war for most Australians was the landing at Gallipoli. Dr. Paul Skrebels of the University of South Australia has noted that Anzac Day has continued to grow in popularity; even the threat of a terrorist attack at the Gallipoli site in 2004 did not deter some 15,000 Australians from making the pilgrimage to Turkey to commemorate the fallen ANZAC troops.

In cities and towns nationwide, marches by veterans from all past wars, as well as current serving members of the Australian Defence Force and Reserves, allied veterans, Australian Defence Force Cadets and Australian Air League, members of Scouts Australia, Guides Australia, and other service groups take place. The Anzac Day March from each state capital is televised live with commentary. These events are generally followed by social gatherings of veterans, hosted either in a public house or in an RSL club, often including a traditional Australian gambling game called two-up, which was an extremely popular pastime with ANZAC soldiers. (In most Australian states and territories, gambling is forbidden outside of licensed venues; however, due to the significance of this tradition, two-up is legal only on Anzac Day.)

A National Ceremony is held at the Australian War Memorial, starting at 10:30 am, with the traditional order of service including the Commemorative Address, wreath laying, hymns, the sounding of the Last Post, observance of one minute&#x27;s silence, and the national anthems of Australia and New Zealand. Families often place artificial red poppies beside the names of relatives on the Memorial&#x27;s Roll of Honour. Sprigs of rosemary or laurel are often worn on lapels.

Although commemoration events are always held on 25 April, most states and territories currently observe a substitute public holiday on the following Monday when Anzac Day falls on a Sunday. When Anzac Day falls on Easter Monday, such as in 2011, the Easter Monday holiday is transferred to Tuesday. This followed a 2008 meeting of the Council for the Australian Federation in which the states and territories made an in-principle agreement to work towards making this a universal practice. However, in 2009, the Legislative Council of Tasmania rejected a bill amendment that would have enabled the substitute holiday in that state.

===Commemorative postage stamps===
Australia Post has issued stamps over the years to commemorate Anzac Day, the first being in 1935 for the 20th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings.

The list of issued stamps includes:
* 1935 – 20th Anniversary (2 values) 2d Red and 1/- Black featuring the London Cenotaph.
* 1955 – the then current 3½d Purple Nursing commemorative stamp was privately overprinted with the words &quot;ANZAC 1915–1955 40 YEARS LEST WE FORGET&quot; and a value ranging from 1d to £1 was also added which was the fundraising amount in addition to the legal cost of stamp of which the denomination was 3½d. Eight values were issued and were intended to raise funds for the Anzac commemorations. It is believed these stamps were authorised by the secretary of a leading Melbourne RSL club.
* 1965 – 50th Anniversary (3 values) 5d Khaki, 8d Blue and 2/3 Maroon featuring Simpson and his donkey.

===Australian rules football===
During many wars, Australian rules football matches have been played overseas in places like northern Africa, Vietnam, and Iraq as a celebration of Australian culture and as a bonding exercise between soldiers.

The modern-day tradition began in 1995 and is played every year between traditional AFL rivals Collingwood and Essendon at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. This annual match is often considered the biggest of the AFL season outside of the finals, sometimes drawing bigger crowds than all but the Grand Final, and often selling out in advance. The inaugural match in 1995 drew a crowd of 94,825 people, with the 2023 match drawing a crowd of 95,179, the second biggest home and away crowd in AFL history. The Anzac Medal is awarded to the player in the match who best exemplifies the Anzac spirit – skill, courage, self-sacrifice, teamwork and fair play. As of 2024, Collingwood hold the advantage 17 wins to 10, with two draws (in 1995 and 2024). The match was not played in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2013, St Kilda and the Sydney Swans played an Anzac Day game in Wellington, New Zealand, the first AFL game played for premiership points outside of Australia. The winning team, Sydney, were presented with the inaugural Simpson–Henderson Trophy by the Prime Minister of New Zealand. The trophy was named after two notable Anzac soldiers: John Simpson Kirkpatrick and Richard Alexander Henderson.

===Rugby League football===

From 1997, the Anzac Test, a rugby league test match, has commemorated Anzac Day, though it is typically played prior to Anzac Day. The match is always played between the Australian and New Zealand national teams, and has drawn attendances of between 20,000 and 45,000 in the past. The final Anzac test occurred in 2017.

Domestically, matches have been played on Anzac Day since 1927 (with occasional exceptions). Since 2002, the National Rugby League (NRL) has followed the lead of the Australian Football League, hosting a match between traditional rivals St. George Illawarra Dragons and the Sydney Roosters each year to commemorate Anzac Day in the ANZAC Day Cup, although these two sides had previously met on Anzac Day several times as early as the 1970s. Between 2009 and 2023, an additional Anzac Day game has been played between the Melbourne Storm and New Zealand Warriors; the South Sydney Rabbitohs replaced the New Zealand Warriors in 2024.

==Commemoration in New Zealand==

New Zealand&#x27;s commemoration of Anzac Day is similar. The number of New Zealanders attending Anzac Day events in New Zealand, and at Gallipoli, is increasing. For some, the day adds weight to the idea that war is futile.
Dawn marches and other memorials nationwide are typically attended by the New Zealand Defence Force, the New Zealand Cadet Forces, members of the New Zealand Police, Fire and Emergency New Zealand, Order of St John Ambulance Service (Youth and Adult Volunteers) as well as Scouting New Zealand, GirlGuiding New Zealand and other uniformed community service groups including in most places the local pipe band to lead or accompany the march, and sometimes a brass band to accompany the hymns.

Anzac Day now promotes a sense of unity, perhaps more effectively than any other day on the national calendar. People whose politics, beliefs and aspirations are widely different can nevertheless share a genuine sorrow at the loss of so many lives in war.

Paper poppies are widely distributed by the Returned Services Association and worn as symbols of remembrance. This tradition follows that of the wearing of poppies on Remembrance Sunday in other Commonwealth countries.

The day is a public holiday in New Zealand. Shops are prohibited from opening before 1 pm under the &quot;Shop Trading Hours Act 1990&quot;. A prior act passed in 1949 prevented the holiday from being Mondayised (moved to the 26th or 27th should the 25th fall on a weekend), although this drew criticism from trade unionists and Labour Party politicians. In 2013, a member&#x27;s bill introduced by Labour MP David Clark to Mondayise Anzac Day and Waitangi Day passed, despite opposition from the governing National Party.

==Commemoration at Gallipoli==

In Turkey the name ANZAC Cove was officially recognised by the Turkish government on Anzac Day in 1985. That year, a monolith installed at Ari Burnu Cemetery (ANZAC Beach) was inscribed with a quotation attributed to Kemal Atatürk in 1934:

The words also appear on the Kemal Atatürk Memorial, Canberra, and the Atatürk Memorial in Wellington. However, despite the common attribution to Atatürk by governments and politicians from Australia and Turkey, historians have found no direct evidence that Atatürk ever spoke these words. A version of the quote first appeared in 1953 from a Turkish journalist with the later inclusion of the phrase &quot;There is no difference between the Johnnies and the Mehmets&quot; emerging in 1978.

In 1990, to mark the 75th anniversary of the Gallipoli landing, government officials from Australia and New Zealand (including Australian prime minister Bob Hawke and New Zealand governor-general Paul Reeves) as well as most of the last surviving Gallipoli veterans, and many Australian and New Zealand tourists travelled to Turkey for a special Dawn Service at Gallipoli. The Gallipoli Dawn Service was held at the Ari Burnu War Cemetery at Anzac Cove, but the growing numbers of people attending resulted in the construction of a more spacious site on North Beach, known as the Anzac Commemorative Site in time for the year 2000 service.

A ballot was held to allocate passes for Australians and New Zealanders wishing to attend Anzac Day commemorations at Gallipoli in 2015. Of the 10,500 people who could be safely, securely and comfortably accommodated at the Anzac Commemorative Site, in 2015 this comprised places for 8,000 Australians, 2,000 New Zealanders and 500 official representatives of all nations involved in the Gallipoli campaign. Only those who received an offer of attendance passes attended the commemorations in 2015.

==Commemoration in other countries==


===Antarctica===
* Scott Base holds a ceremony honouring the fallen on Anzac Day. Americans from the nearby McMurdo Station are often invited.

===Belgium===
* In Ypres, Belgium, a dawn service is held at the Buttes New British Cemetery in Zonnebeke; there is a 9:30 am service at the Tyne Cot Cemetery; a procession from the Ypres Cloth Hall to Menin Gate begins at 11:10 am and the Wreath-laying ceremony at the Belgian War Memorial takes place at 11:35 am. In addition, the nightly Last Post Ceremony takes place at the Menin Gate at 8 pm, when buglers from the Last Post Association sound this act of homage as they have every night since 1928.
*In Comines-Warneton, The Ploegsteert Toronto Avenue Cemetery Commemoration Service takes place at 4 pm.

===Brunei===
* In Muara, a pre-dawn service is held on 25 April at the Brunei-Australia Memorial as a remembrance of the servicemen and women of Australia and New Zealand. The commemoration is held on Muara Beach, the site where the Allied forces led by Australia&#x27;s 9th Division landed in Brunei on 10 June 1945 as part of the campaign to liberate Borneo from the Japanese.

===Canada===
* In St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, the Gallipoli offensive is commemorated each year on 25 April by the Royal Newfoundland Regiment, which was the only unit from North America to fight on Gallipoli, who hold a march from Government House through the streets ending at the National War Memorial. Members of both the Australian and New Zealand armed forces are invited each year to participate in the march and wreath laying ceremonies.
* In Ottawa, Ontario, a service starting at 9 am is held at the Canadian War Museum.
* In Toronto, Ontario, Anzac service is held at the Armour Heights Officers&#x27; Mess, Canadian Forces College.
* In London, Ontario a dawn service starting at 5:45 am was held in 2017 at the Worseley Barracks.
* In Winnipeg, Manitoba Anzac Day was commemorated by the Down Under Club of Winnipeg on Saturday 29 April 2017 from 6 pm until 10 pm at the Scandinavian Cultural Centre.

===Egypt===
* In Cairo, Egypt, Anzac Day is remembered by the expatriate New Zealand and Australian communities with a dawn ceremony held at the Cairo Commonwealth War Memorial Cemetery, Abu Seifen Street, Old Cairo. New Zealand and Australian Embassies rotate hosting the service.

===France===
* In the town of Villers-Bretonneux, the Australian government holds an annual dawn service. For decades, the commemoration was organised by French locals (on the next closest weekend to Anzac Day) until the Australian government took over the organisation of an Anzac Day dawn service at the Australian National Memorial, Villers-Bretonneux. Historian Romain Fathi has explained that several factors contributed to this &quot;commemorative take-over&quot;, such as the need to have an official service in France, a deteriorating relationship with Turkey in the mid-2000s that jeopardised access to Anzac Cove, and associating Anzac Day with victory on the Western Front, rather than defeat at Gallipoli. Indeed, in the Australian narrative of Second Villers-Bretonneux, the town was re-taken on 25 April 1918, a symbolic anniversary. In fact, that operation was not finished until 27 April.
* The town of Fromelles holds an annual service at Pheasant Wood Military Cemetery where a few hundred lost Australian soldiers were reburied after being discovered nearby. The ceremony is attended by representatives of the Australian government and French military. The Battle of Fromelles, an important battle for Australians, happened near the town.
* In France services are also held in the towns of Le Quesnoy and Longueval. Since the 1990s, an Anzac Day service has also been held at Bullecourt, organised by local French authorities.
* In French Polynesia, Anzac Day has been commemorated with an official ceremony held in Papeete since 2006. The 2009 ceremony was attended by French Polynesia President Oscar Temaru, who praised the &quot;courage and liberty&quot; of Australian and New Zealand soldiers in a statement.

===Germany===
* In Germany, Anzac Day is commemorated in Berlin, at the Commonwealth Kriegsgräber, Charlottenburg. (Commonwealth War Graves).

===Greece===
* In the Greek capital of Athens, Anzac Day is commemorated at the Phaleron Allied War Cemetery. 
* Since 1998, Anzac Day has also been commemorated in the island of Lemnos, which served as an Allied base of operations during the Gallipoli campaign, and where there are two Allied cemeteries, at Mudros Bay and at Portianou.

===Hong Kong===
* In Hong Kong, a simple dawn commemorative service is held at The Centotaph in Central, with a member of the Hong Kong Police Band playing the Last Post and Reveille from the balcony of the nearby Hong Kong Club.

===India===
* On 25 April 2019 a wreath-laying ceremony was held for the first time in the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery, Kolkata. The Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery in Kolkata is housed inside the Bhawanipur Cemetery and houses over 700 war graves, including those of four Australian and two New Zealand soldiers, all of whom died in World War II. The ceremony was headed by Australian high commissioner to India Harinder Sindhu and Australian consul-general in Kolkata Andrew Ford.

==Commercialisation==
From the beginning, there has been concern to protect the Anzac tradition from inappropriate use. In Australia, use of the word &quot;Anzac&quot; is regulated under the &quot;Protection of Word &quot;Anzac&quot; Act 1920&quot;. The &quot;Protection of Word &#x27;Anzac&#x27; Regulations 1921&quot; state that: &quot;no person may use the word &#x27;Anzac&#x27;, or any word resembling it, in connection with any trade, business, calling or profession or in connection with any entertainment or any lottery or art union or as the name or part of a name of any private residence, boat, vehicle of charitable or other institution, or other institution, or any building without the authority of the Minister for Veterans&#x27; Affairs&quot;. The maximum penalty is 12 months imprisonment, or $10,200 for a person and $51,000 for a corporation.

Over recent years, some historians and commentators have raised concerns over what they see as the increasing commercialisation of Anzac Day. In 2015, historian Carolyn Holbrook stated that companies were seeking to associate themselves with Anzac Day as &quot;Anzac is the most potent and popular brand going around in Australia today.&quot; Questionable Anzac marketing campaigns included Woolworths&#x27; Fresh in Our Memories campaign in 2015, which provoked a strong public backlash. According to Holbrook, Anzac Day is more sacred than Easter or Christmas to many. Historian professor Joan Beaumont, researcher Jo Hawkins and historical commentator David Stephens have argued that the federal government has not been sufficiently enforcing regulations which limit the extent to which companies can refer to Anzac Day, or use the word Anzac, in their marketing. There has been widespread public opposition to the more blatant attempts to commercialise Anzac Day, which has led to some products being withdrawn from sale. Many of the products associated with the centenary of the Gallipoli landings were also commercial failures.

A notable exception is the manufacture and sale of the Anzac biscuit, originally home made to published recipes from about 1920, and for many decades manufactured commercially for retail sale in both Australia and New Zealand. Commercial manufacture and sale of the biscuits is explicitly exempted from restrictions on the use of the word Anzac.

==Criticism of some commemorations==
For decades, there have been concerns that the participation of young people in Anzac Day events has injected a carnival element into what is traditionally a solemn occasion. The change was highlighted by a rock concert-style performance at the 2005 Anzac Cove commemoration during which attendees drank and slept between headstones. After the event the site was left strewn with rubbish. In 2013, historian Jonathan King said that &quot;escalating commercial pressures threaten to turn the centenary [of the landing at Gallipoli] into a Big Day Out&quot;.

Digital change has been the focus of recent concern. The centenary commemoration of Anzac and the First World War has coincided with the emergence of a mature internet and comprehensive use of social media. According to Tom Sear, a new era of &quot;digital commemoration&quot; of Anzac Day has begun. Anzac Day selfies, memes, virtual reality Anzac avatars, Facebook posts and tweeting are part of a new participative, and immersive experience of the day. Digital media have personalised the experience of Anzac Day, focusing on sharing the activities online. In a time when the line between being online and offline is increasingly blurred, there has been a turn towards commemorative activities that seek to generate empathy and connection between contemporary audiences and historical subjects through digital media. Leading news organisations such as the ABC and News Corp live tweeted and made Facebook posts about the original Anzac landings in 2015. These online forums, and their capacity for personalised feedback, have disquieted some historians, who are concerned about the distance, solemnity and critical perspective of traditional Anzac Day commemorations being lost. Equally others emphasise how, particularly young people, using these technologies of the present, play a role in connecting wider communities of Anzac Day commemorators.

==Criticism of Anzac Day==
At its inception, Anzac Day faced criticism from the Australian labour movement, and in the country at large, there has been opposition to political exploitation of what was seen as a day of mourning. One controversy occurred in 1960 with the publication of Alan Seymour&#x27;s classic play, &quot;The One Day of the Year&quot;, which dramatised the growing social divide in Australia and the questioning of old values. In the play, Anzac Day is critiqued by the central character, Hughie, as a day of drunken debauchery by returned soldiers and as a day when questions of what it means to be loyal to a nation or empire must be raised. The play was scheduled to be performed at the inaugural Adelaide Festival of Arts, but after complaints from the Returned Services League, the governors of the festival refused permission for this to occur.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, related to Australia&#x27;s involvement in the Vietnam war and other issues, Anzac Day not only sank in popularity but was the focus for the expression of much dissent. (&quot;See &quot;)

Anzac Day has been criticised in recent years by a number of Australians and New Zealanders, as, for example, &quot;a day that obscures the politics of war and discourages political dissent&quot;. In October 2008, former Australian prime minister Paul Keating stated that he believes it is misguided for people to gather each year at Anzac Cove to commemorate the landing at Gallipoli, because it is &quot;utter and complete nonsense&quot; to suggest that the nation was &quot;born again or even, redeemed there&quot;. Kevin Rudd, the Australian prime minister at the time, rejected Keating&#x27;s views, saying the Gallipoli campaign is &quot;part of our national consciousness, it&#x27;s part of our national psyche, it&#x27;s part of our national identity, and I, for one, as Prime Minister of the country, am absolutely proud of it&quot;.

Some critics have suggested that the revival in public interest in Anzac Day amongst the young results from the fact that younger Australians have not themselves experienced war. Critics see the revival as part of a rise of unreflective nationalism in Australia which was particularly fostered by the then Australian prime minister John Howard. Some historians believe Anzac Day events are now on the decline, although it is likely there will continue to be smaller dawn services and official events in the future. Martin Crotty thought that perhaps it was now a ritual for older, traditional Australians, with old values of mateship and loyalty and even as a &quot;reaction against globalisation&quot;; however, Carolyn Holbrook disagrees, arguing that young people are responsible for the resurgence, and among older people there is a big group of sceptics, Baby Boomers who were influenced by Vietnam War protests.

Other criticisms have revolved around a perceived overzealousness in Australian attachment to the event, either from participants unaware of the loss or when the focus is at the expense of remembrance of the contribution of New Zealand. In 2005, John Howard was criticised for shunning the New Zealand Anzac ceremony at Gallipoli, preferring instead to spend his morning at a barbecue on the beach with Australian soldiers. In 2009, New Zealand historians noted that some Australian children were unaware that New Zealand was a part of ANZAC. In 2012, a New Zealand journalist caused controversy following comments that Australian World War I soldiers were bludgers and thieves.

<doc id="48039" wikidata="Q298521" url="?curid=48039" title="Saul Kripke">
<text>Saul Aaron Kripke (; November 13, 1940 – September 15, 2022) was an American analytic philosopher and logician. He was Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and emeritus professor at Princeton University. From the 1960s until his death, he was a central figure in a number of fields related to mathematical and modal logic, philosophy of language and mathematics, metaphysics, epistemology, and recursion theory.

Kripke made influential and original contributions to logic, especially modal logic. His principal contribution is a semantics for modal logic involving possible worlds, now called Kripke semantics. He received the 2001 Schock Prize in Logic and Philosophy.

Kripke was also partly responsible for the revival of metaphysics and essentialism after the decline of logical positivism, claiming necessity is a metaphysical notion distinct from the epistemic notion of &quot;a priori&quot;, and that there are necessary truths that are known &quot;a posteriori&quot;, such as that water is H2O. A 1970 Princeton lecture series, published in book form in 1980 as &quot;Naming and Necessity&quot;, is considered one of the most important philosophical works of the 20th century. It introduced the concept of names as rigid designators, designating (picking out, denoting, referring to) the same object in every possible world, as contrasted with descriptions. It also established Kripke&#x27;s causal theory of reference, disputing the descriptivist theory found in Gottlob Frege&#x27;s concept of sense and Bertrand Russell&#x27;s theory of descriptions. Kripke is often seen in opposition to the other great late-20th-century philosopher to eschew logical positivism: W. V. O. Quine. Quine rejected essentialism and modal logic.

Kripke also gave an original reading of Ludwig Wittgenstein, known as &quot;Kripkenstein&quot;, in his &quot;Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language&quot;. The book contains his rule-following argument, a paradox for skepticism about meaning. Much of his work remains unpublished or exists only as tape recordings and privately circulated manuscripts.

==Life and career==
Saul Kripke was the oldest of three children born to Dorothy K. Kripke and Myer S. Kripke. His father was the leader of Beth El Synagogue, the only Conservative congregation in Omaha, Nebraska; his mother wrote Jewish educational books for children. Saul and his two sisters, Madeline and Netta, attended Dundee Grade School and Omaha Central High School. Kripke was labeled a prodigy, teaching himself Ancient Hebrew by the age of six, reading Shakespeare&#x27;s complete works by nine, and mastering the works of Descartes and complex mathematical problems before finishing elementary school. He wrote his first completeness theorem in modal logic at 17, and had it published a year later. After graduating from high school in 1958, Kripke attended Harvard University and graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in 1962 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics. During his sophomore year at Harvard, he taught a graduate-level logic course at nearby MIT. Upon graduation he received a Fulbright Fellowship, and in 1963 was appointed to the Society of Fellows. Kripke later said, &quot;I wish I could have skipped college. I got to know some interesting people but I can&#x27;t say I learned anything. I probably would have learned it all anyway just reading on my own.&quot; His cousin is Eric Kripke, known for creating the television show &quot;The Boys&quot;.

After briefly teaching at Harvard, Kripke moved in 1968 to Rockefeller University in New York City, where he taught until 1976. In 1978 he took a chaired professorship at Princeton University. In 1988 he received the university&#x27;s Behrman Award for distinguished achievement in the humanities. In 2002 Kripke began teaching at the CUNY Graduate Center, and in 2003 he was appointed a distinguished professor of philosophy there.

Kripke has received honorary degrees from the University of Nebraska, Omaha (1977), Johns Hopkins University (1997), University of Haifa, Israel (1998), and the University of Pennsylvania (2005). He was a member of the American Philosophical Society and an elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and in 1985 was a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy. He won the Schock Prize in Logic and Philosophy in 2001.

Kripke was married to philosopher Margaret Gilbert.

Kripke died of pancreatic cancer on September 15, 2022, in Plainsboro, New Jersey, at the age of 81.

==Work==

Kripke&#x27;s contributions to philosophy include:

# Kripke semantics for modal and related logics, published in several essays beginning in his teens.
# His 1970 Princeton lectures &quot;Naming and Necessity&quot; (published in 1972 and 1980), which significantly restructured philosophy of language.
# His interpretation of Wittgenstein.
# His theory of truth.

He has also contributed to recursion theory (see admissible ordinal and Kripke–Platek set theory).

===Modal logic===
Two of Kripke&#x27;s earlier works, &quot;A Completeness Theorem in Modal Logic&quot; (1959) and &quot;Semantical Considerations on Modal Logic&quot; (1963), the former written when he was a teenager, were on modal logic. The most familiar logics in the modal family are constructed from a weak logic called K, named after Kripke. Kripke introduced the now-standard Kripke semantics (also known as relational semantics or frame semantics) for modal logics. Kripke semantics is a formal semantics for non-classical logic systems. It was first made for modal logics, and later adapted to intuitionistic logic and other non-classical systems. The discovery of Kripke semantics was a breakthrough in the making of non-classical logics, because the model theory of such logics was absent before Kripke.

A Kripke frame or modal frame is a pair formula_1, where &quot;W&quot; is a non-empty set, and &quot;R&quot; is a binary relation on &quot;W&quot;. Elements of &quot;W&quot; are called &quot;nodes&quot; or &quot;worlds&quot;, and &quot;R&quot; is known as the accessibility relation. Depending on the properties of the accessibility relation (transitivity, reflexivity, etc.), the corresponding frame is described, by extension, as being transitive, reflexive, etc.

A Kripke model is a triple formula_2, where formula_1 is a Kripke frame, and formula_4 is a relation between nodes of &quot;W&quot; and modal formulas, such that:

* formula_5 if and only if formula_6,
* formula_7 if and only if formula_6 or formula_9,
* formula_10 if and only if formula_11 implies formula_12.

We read formula_13 as &quot;&quot;w&quot; satisfies &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot; is satisfied in &quot;w&quot;, or &quot;w&quot; forces &quot;A&quot;&quot;. The relation formula_4 is called the &quot;satisfaction relation&quot;, &quot;evaluation&quot;, or &quot;forcing relation&quot;. The satisfaction relation is uniquely determined by its value on propositional variables.

A formula &quot;A&quot; is valid in:

* a model formula_2, if formula_13 for all &quot;w&quot; ∈ &quot;W&quot;,
* a frame formula_1, if it is valid in formula_2 for all possible choices of formula_4,
* a class &quot;C&quot; of frames or models, if it is valid in every member of &quot;C&quot;.

We define Thm(&quot;C&quot;) to be the set of all formulas that are valid in &quot;C&quot;. Conversely, if &quot;X&quot; is a set of formulas, let Mod(&quot;X&quot;) be the class of all frames which validate every formula from &quot;X&quot;.

A modal logic (i.e., a set of formulas) &quot;L&quot; is sound with respect to a class of frames &quot;C&quot;, if &quot;L&quot; ⊆ Thm(&quot;C&quot;). &quot;L&quot; is complete with respect to &quot;C&quot; if &quot;L&quot; ⊇ Thm(&quot;C&quot;).

Semantics is useful for investigating a logic (i.e., a derivation system) only if the semantical entailment relation reflects its syntactical counterpart, the &quot;consequence&quot; relation (&quot;derivability&quot;). It is vital to know which modal logics are sound and complete with respect to a class of Kripke frames, and for them, to determine which class it is.

For any class &quot;C&quot; of Kripke frames, Thm(&quot;C&quot;) is a normal modal logic (in particular, theorems of the minimal normal modal logic, &quot;K&quot;, are valid in every Kripke model). However, the converse does not hold generally. There are Kripke incomplete normal modal logics, which is unproblematic, because most of the modal systems studied are complete of classes of frames described by simple conditions.

A normal modal logic &quot;L&quot; corresponds to a class of frames &quot;C&quot;, if &quot;C&quot; = Mod(&quot;L&quot;). In other words, &quot;C&quot; is the largest class of frames such that &quot;L&quot; is sound wrt &quot;C&quot;. It follows that &quot;L&quot; is Kripke complete if and only if it is complete of its corresponding class.

Consider the schema T : formula_20. T is valid in any reflexive frame formula_1: if formula_22, then formula_13 since &quot;w&quot; &quot;R&quot; &quot;w&quot;. On the other hand, a frame which validates T has to be reflexive: fix &quot;w&quot; ∈ &quot;W&quot;, and define satisfaction of a propositional variable &quot;p&quot; as follows: formula_24 if and only if &quot;w&quot; &quot;R&quot; &quot;u&quot;. Then formula_25, thus formula_26 by T, which means &quot;w&quot; &quot;R&quot; &quot;w&quot; using the definition of formula_4. T corresponds to the class of reflexive Kripke frames.

It is often much easier to characterize the corresponding class of &quot;L&quot; than to prove its completeness, thus correspondence serves as a guide to completeness proofs. Correspondence is also used to show &quot;incompleteness&quot; of modal logics: suppose &quot;L&quot;1 ⊆ &quot;L&quot;2 are normal modal logics that correspond to the same class of frames, but &quot;L&quot;1 does not prove all theorems of &quot;L&quot;2. Then &quot;L&quot;1 is Kripke incomplete. For example, the schema formula_28 generates an incomplete logic, as it corresponds to the same class of frames as GL (viz. transitive and converse well-founded frames), but does not prove the GL-tautology formula_29.

==== Canonical models ====

For any normal modal logic &quot;L&quot;, a Kripke model (called the canonical model) can be constructed, which validates precisely the theorems of &quot;L&quot;, by an adaptation of the standard technique of using maximal consistent sets as models. Canonical Kripke models play a role similar to the Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra construction in algebraic semantics.

A set of formulas is &quot;L&quot;-&quot;consistent&quot; if no contradiction can be derived from them using the axioms of &quot;L&quot;, and modus ponens. A &quot;maximal L-consistent set&quot; (an &quot;L&quot;-&quot;MCS&quot; for short) is an &quot;L&quot;-consistent set which has no proper &quot;L&quot;-consistent superset.

The canonical model of &quot;L&quot; is a Kripke model formula_2, where &quot;W&quot; is the set of all &quot;L&quot;-&quot;MCS&quot;, and the relations &quot;R&quot; and formula_4 are as follows:

: formula_32 if and only if for every formula formula_33, if formula_34 then formula_35,
: formula_36 if and only if formula_37.

The canonical model is a model of &quot;L&quot;, as every &quot;L&quot;-&quot;MCS&quot; contains all theorems of &quot;L&quot;. By Zorn&#x27;s lemma, each &quot;L&quot;-consistent set is contained in an &quot;L&quot;-&quot;MCS&quot;, in particular every formula unprovable in &quot;L&quot; has a counterexample in the canonical model.

The main application of canonical models are completeness proofs. Properties of the canonical model of K immediately imply completeness of K with respect to the class of all Kripke frames. This argument does &quot;not&quot; work for arbitrary &quot;L&quot;, because there is no guarantee that the underlying &quot;frame&quot; of the canonical model satisfies the frame conditions of &quot;L&quot;.

We say that a formula or a set &quot;X&quot; of formulas is canonical with respect to a property &quot;P&quot; of Kripke frames, if

* &quot;X&quot; is valid in every frame which satisfies &quot;P&quot;,
* for any normal modal logic &quot;L&quot; which contains &quot;X&quot;, the underlying frame of the canonical model of &quot;L&quot; satisfies &quot;P&quot;.

A union of canonical sets of formulas is itself canonical. It follows from the preceding discussion that any logic axiomatized by a canonical set of formulas is Kripke complete, and compact.

The axioms T, 4, D, B, 5, H, G (and thus any combination of them) are canonical. GL and Grz are not canonical, because they are not compact. The axiom M by itself is not canonical (Goldblatt, 1991), but the combined logic S4.1 (in fact, even K4.1) is canonical.

In general, it is undecidable whether a given axiom is canonical. We know a nice sufficient condition: H. Sahlqvist identified a broad class of formulas (now called Sahlqvist formulas) such that:

* a Sahlqvist formula is canonical,
* the class of frames corresponding to a Sahlqvist formula is first-order definable,
* there is an algorithm which computes the corresponding frame condition to a given Sahlqvist formula.

This is a powerful criterion: for example, all axioms listed above as canonical are (equivalent to) Sahlqvist formulas. A logic has the finite model property (FMP) if it is complete with respect to a class of finite frames. An application of this notion is the decidability question: it follows from Post&#x27;s theorem that a recursively axiomatized modal logic L which has FMP is decidable, provided it is decidable whether a given finite frame is a model of L. In particular, every finitely axiomatizable logic with FMP is decidable.

There are various methods for establishing FMP for a given logic. Refinements and extensions of the canonical model construction often work, using tools such as filtration or unravelling. As another possibility, completeness proofs based on cut-free sequent calculi usually produce finite models directly.

Most of the modal systems used in practice (including all listed above) have FMP.

In some cases, we can use FMP to prove Kripke completeness of a logic: every normal modal logic is complete wrt a class of modal algebras, and a finite modal algebra can be transformed into a Kripke frame. As an example, Robert Bull proved using this method that every normal extension of S4.3 has FMP, and is Kripke complete.

Kripke semantics has a straightforward generalization to logics with more than one modality. A Kripke frame for a language with
formula_38 as the set of its necessity operators consists of a non-empty set &quot;W&quot; equipped with binary relations &quot;Ri&quot; for each &quot;i&quot; ∈ &quot;I&quot;. The definition of a satisfaction relation is modified as follows:

: formula_39 if and only if formula_40

==== Carlson models ====

A simplified semantics, discovered by Tim Carlson, is often used for polymodal provability logics. A Carlson model is a structure formula_41 with a single accessibility relation &quot;R&quot;, and subsets &quot;Di&quot; ⊆ &quot;W&quot; for each modality. Satisfaction is defined as:

: formula_39 if and only if formula_43

Carlson models are easier to visualize and to work with than usual polymodal Kripke models; there are, however, Kripke complete polymodal logics which are Carlson incomplete.

In &quot;Semantical Considerations on Modal Logic&quot;, published in 1963, Kripke responded to a difficulty with classical quantification theory. The motivation for the world-relative approach was to represent the possibility that objects in one world may fail to exist in another. But if standard quantifier rules are used, every term must refer to something that exists in all the possible worlds. This seems incompatible with our ordinary practice of using terms to refer to things that exist contingently.

Kripke&#x27;s response to this difficulty was to eliminate terms. He gave an example of a system that uses the world-relative interpretation and preserves the classical rules. But the costs are severe. First, his language is artificially impoverished, and second, the rules for the propositional modal logic must be weakened.

Kripke&#x27;s possible worlds theory has been used by narratologists (beginning with Pavel and Dolezel) to understand &quot;reader&#x27;s manipulation of alternative plot developments, or the characters&#x27; planned or fantasized alternative action series.&quot; This application has become especially useful in the analysis of hyperfiction.

===Intuitionistic logic===
Kripke semantics for intuitionistic logic follows the same principles as the semantics of modal logic, but uses a different definition of satisfaction.

An intuitionistic Kripke model is a triple
formula_44, where formula_45 is a partially ordered Kripke frame, and formula_4 satisfies the following conditions:
* if &quot;p&quot; is a propositional variable, formula_47, and formula_26, then formula_24 (&quot;persistency&quot; condition),
* formula_50 if and only if formula_13 and formula_9,
* formula_53 if and only if formula_13 or formula_9,
* formula_7 if and only if for all formula_57, formula_58 implies formula_59,
* not formula_60.

Intuitionistic logic is sound and complete with respect to its Kripke semantics, and it has the Finite Model Property.

Intuitionistic first-order logic

Let &quot;L&quot; be a first-order language. A Kripke model of &quot;L&quot; is a triple
formula_61, where
formula_45 is an intuitionistic Kripke frame, &quot;Mw&quot; is a
(classical) &quot;L&quot;-structure for each node &quot;w&quot; ∈ &quot;W&quot;, and the following compatibility conditions hold whenever &quot;u&quot; ≤ &quot;v&quot;:
* the domain of &quot;Mu&quot; is included in the domain of &quot;Mv&quot;,
* realizations of function symbols in &quot;Mu&quot; and &quot;Mv&quot; agree on elements of &quot;Mu&quot;,
* for each &quot;n&quot;-ary predicate &quot;P&quot; and elements &quot;a&quot;1...,&quot;an&quot; ∈ &quot;Mu&quot;: if &quot;P&quot;(&quot;a&quot;1...,&quot;an&quot;) holds in &quot;Mu&quot;, then it holds in &quot;Mv&quot;.
Given an evaluation &quot;e&quot; of variables by elements of &quot;Mw&quot;, we define the satisfaction relation formula_63:
* formula_64 if and only if formula_65 holds in &quot;Mw&quot;,
* formula_66 if and only if formula_63 and formula_68,
* formula_69 if and only if formula_63 or formula_68,
* formula_72 if and only if for all formula_57, formula_74 implies formula_75,
* not formula_76,
* formula_77 if and only if there exists an formula_78 such that formula_79,
* formula_80 if and only if for every formula_57 and every formula_82, formula_83.
Here &quot;e&quot;(&quot;x&quot;→&quot;a&quot;) is the evaluation which gives &quot;x&quot; the value &quot;a&quot;, and otherwise agrees with &quot;e&quot;.

===&quot;Naming and Necessity&quot;===

The three lectures that form &quot;Naming and Necessity&quot; constitute an attack on the descriptivist theory of names. Kripke attributes variants of descriptivist theories to Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, and John Searle, among others. According to descriptivist theories, proper names either are synonymous with descriptions, or have their reference determined by virtue of the name&#x27;s being associated with a description or cluster of descriptions that an object uniquely satisfies. Kripke rejects both these kinds of descriptivism. He gives several examples purporting to render descriptivism implausible as a theory of how names get their references determined (e.g., surely Aristotle could have died at age two and so not satisfied any of the descriptions we associate with his name, but it would seem wrong to deny that he was still Aristotle).

As an alternative, Kripke outlined a causal theory of reference, according to which a name refers to an object by virtue of a causal connection with the object as mediated through communities of speakers. He points out that proper names, in contrast to most descriptions, are rigid designators: that is, a proper name refers to the named object in every possible world in which the object exists, while most descriptions designate different objects in different possible worlds. For example, &quot;Richard Nixon&quot; refers to the same person in every possible world in which Nixon exists, while &quot;the person who won the United States presidential election of 1968&quot; could refer to Nixon, Humphrey, or others in different possible worlds.

Kripke also raised the prospect of &quot;a posteriori necessities&quot;—facts that are necessarily true, though they can be known only through empirical investigation. Examples include &quot;Hesperus is Phosphorus&quot;, &quot;Cicero is Tully&quot;, &quot;Water is H2O&quot;, and other identity claims where two names refer to the same object. According to Kripke, the Kantian distinctions between analytic and synthetic, &quot;a priori&quot; and &quot;a posteriori&quot;, and contingent and necessary do not map onto one another. Rather, analytic/synthetic is a semantic distinction, &quot;a priori&quot;/&quot;a posteriori&quot; is an epistemic distinction, and contingent/necessary is a metaphysical distinction.

Finally, Kripke gave an argument against identity materialism in the philosophy of mind, the view that every mental particular is identical with some physical particular. Kripke argued that the only way to defend this identity is as an &quot;a posteriori&quot; necessary identity, but that such an identity—e.g., that pain is C-fibers firing—could not be necessary, given the (clearly conceivable) possibility that pain could be separate from the firing of C-fibers, or the firing of C-fibers be separate from pain. (Similar arguments have since been made by David Chalmers.) In any event, the psychophysical identity theorist, according to Kripke, incurs a dialectical obligation to explain the apparent logical possibility of these circumstances, since according to such theorists they should be impossible.

Kripke delivered the John Locke Lectures in philosophy at Oxford in 1973. Titled &quot;Reference and Existence&quot;, they were in many respects a continuation of &quot;Naming and Necessity&quot;, and deal with the subjects of fictional names and perceptual error. In 2013 Oxford University Press published the lectures as a book, also titled &quot;Reference and Existence&quot;.

In a 1995 paper, philosopher Quentin Smith argued that key concepts in Kripke&#x27;s new theory of reference originated in the work of Ruth Barcan Marcus more than a decade earlier. Smith identified six significant ideas in the New Theory that he claimed Marcus had developed: (1) that proper names are direct references that do not consist of contained definitions; (2) that while one can single out a single thing by a description, this description is not equivalent to a proper name of this thing; (3) the modal argument that proper names are directly referential, and not disguised descriptions; (4) a formal modal logic proof of the necessity of identity; (5) the concept of a rigid designator, though Kripke coined that term; and (6) &quot;a posteriori&quot; identity. Smith argued that Kripke failed to understand Marcus&#x27;s theory at the time but later adopted many of its key conceptual themes in his New Theory of Reference.

Other scholars have subsequently offered detailed responses arguing that no plagiarism occurred.

====&quot;A Puzzle about Belief&quot;====

In &quot;Naming and Necessity&quot;, Kripke argues for direct reference theory (that the meaning of a name is simply the object it refers to). Nevertheless, he acknowledges the possibility that propositions containing names may have some additional semantic properties, properties that could explain why two names referring to the same person may give different truth values in propositions about beliefs. For example, Lois Lane believes that Superman can fly, although she does not believe that Clark Kent can fly. According to the mediated reference theory of names, this is explained by the fact that the names &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Clark Kent&quot;, though referring to the same person, have distinct semantic properties.

But in his article &quot;A Puzzle about Belief&quot; (1988) Kripke seems to oppose even this possibility. His argument can be reconstructed as follows: The idea that two names referring to the same object may have different semantic properties is supposed to explain the fact that the intersubstitution of coreferring names in propositions about beliefs can alter truth value (as in Lois Lane&#x27;s case). But the same phenomenon occurs even without the intersubstitution of coreferring names: Kripke invites us to imagine a French, monolingual boy, Pierre, who believes the proposition expressed by &quot;Londres est jolie&quot; (&quot;London is beautiful&quot;). Pierre moves to London without realizing that London = Londres. He then learns English the same way a child would learn the language, that is, not by translating words from French to English. Pierre learns the name &quot;London&quot; from the unattractive part of the city where he lives, and so comes to believe that London is not beautiful. Pierre will now assent to the sentences &quot;Londres est jolie&quot; and &quot;London is not beautiful&quot;. With only translation and disquotation, the puzzle can be generated: Pierre both believes that London is pretty and doesn&#x27;t believe that London is pretty. This paradox arises without making use of intersubstitution of coreferring names. Kripke shows later in the article how this puzzle can be generated &quot;within a single language&quot;, using only disquotation. The upshot of this, according to Kripke, is that intersubstitution of coreferring names cannot be blamed for the difficulty created by belief contexts. If this is right, contra proponents of mediated reference theory, the inconsistency of belief contexts involving coreferring names cannot be taken as evidence against his direct reference theory of names.

===Wittgenstein===

First published in 1982, Kripke&#x27;s &quot;Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language&quot; contends that the central argument of Wittgenstein&#x27;s &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; centers on a devastating rule-following paradox that undermines the possibility of our ever following rules in our use of language. Kripke writes that this paradox is &quot;the most radical and original skeptical problem that philosophy has seen to date&quot;, and that Wittgenstein does not reject the argument that leads to the rule-following paradox, but accepts it and offers a &quot;skeptical solution&quot; to ameliorate the paradox&#x27;s destructive effects.

Most commentators accept that &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; contains the rule-following paradox as Kripke presents it, but few have agreed with his attributing a skeptical solution to Wittgenstein. Kripke himself expresses doubts in &quot;Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language&quot; as to whether Wittgenstein would endorse his interpretation of &quot;Philosophical Investigations.&quot; He says that the work should not be read as an attempt to give an accurate statement of Wittgenstein&#x27;s views, but rather as an account of Wittgenstein&#x27;s argument &quot;as it struck Kripke, as it presented a problem for him&quot;.

The portmanteau &quot;Kripkenstein&quot; has been coined for Kripke&#x27;s interpretation of &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot;. Kripkenstein&#x27;s main significance was a clear statement of a new kind of skepticism, dubbed &quot;meaning skepticism&quot;: the idea that for isolated individuals there is no fact in virtue of which they mean one thing rather than another by the use of a word. Kripke&#x27;s &quot;skeptical solution&quot; to meaning skepticism is to ground meaning in the behavior of a community.

Kripke&#x27;s book generated a large secondary literature, divided between those who find his skeptical problem interesting and perceptive, and others, such as Gordon Baker, Peter Hacker, and Colin McGinn, who argue that his meaning skepticism is a pseudo-problem that stems from a confused, selective reading of Wittgenstein. Kripke&#x27;s position has been defended against these and other attacks by the Cambridge philosopher Martin Kusch, and Wittgenstein scholar David G. Stern considers Kripke&#x27;s book &quot;the most influential and widely discussed&quot; work on Wittgenstein since the 1980s.

===Truth===
In his 1975 article &quot;Outline of a Theory of Truth&quot;, Kripke showed that a language can consistently contain its own truth predicate, something deemed impossible by Alfred Tarski, a pioneer in formal theories of truth. The approach involves letting truth be a partially defined property over the set of grammatically well-formed sentences in the language. Kripke showed how to do this recursively by starting from the set of expressions in a language that do not contain the truth predicate, and defining a truth predicate over just that segment: this action adds new sentences to the language, and truth is in turn defined for all of them. Unlike Tarski&#x27;s approach, however, Kripke&#x27;s lets &quot;truth&quot; be the union of all of these definition-stages; after a denumerable infinity of steps the language reaches a &quot;fixed point&quot; such that using Kripke&#x27;s method to expand the truth-predicate does not change the language any further. Such a fixed point can then be taken as the basic form of a natural language containing its own truth predicate. But this predicate is undefined for any sentences that do not, so to speak, &quot;bottom out&quot; in simpler sentences not containing a truth predicate. That is, &quot; &#x27;Snow is white&#x27; is true&quot; is well-defined, as is &quot; &#x27; &quot;Snow is white&quot; is true&#x27; is true,&quot; and so forth, but neither &quot;This sentence is true&quot; nor &quot;This sentence is not true&quot; receive truth-conditions; they are, in Kripke&#x27;s terms, &quot;ungrounded.&quot;

Gödel&#x27;s first incompleteness theorem demonstrates that self-reference cannot be avoided naively, since propositions about seemingly unrelated objects (such as integers) can have an informal self-referential meaning, and this idea – manifested by the diagonal lemma – is the basis for Tarski&#x27;s theorem that truth cannot be consistently defined. But Kripke&#x27;s truth predicate does not give a truth value (true/false) to propositions such as the one built in Tarski&#x27;s proof, since it is provable by induction that it is undefined at stage formula_84 for every finite formula_84.

Kripke&#x27;s proposal is problematic in the sense that while the language contains a &quot;truth&quot; predicate of itself (at least a partial one), some of its sentences – such as the liar sentence (&quot;this sentence is false&quot;) – have an undefined truth value, but the language does not contain its own &quot;undefined&quot; predicate. In fact it cannot, as that would create a new version of the liar paradox, the &quot;strengthened liar paradox&quot; (&quot;this sentence is false or undefined&quot;). Thus while the liar sentence is undefined in the language, the language cannot express that it is undefined.

==Saul Kripke Center==

The Saul Kripke Center at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York is dedicated to preserving and promoting Kripke&#x27;s work. Its director is Romina Padro. The Saul Kripke Center holds events related to Kripke&#x27;s work and is creating a digital archive of previously unpublished recordings of Kripke&#x27;s lectures, lecture notes, and correspondence dating back to the 1950s. In his favorable review of Kripke&#x27;s &quot;Philosophical Troubles&quot;, the philosopher Mark Crimmins wrote, &quot;That four of the most admired and discussed essays in 1970s philosophy are here is enough to make this first volume of Saul Kripke&#x27;s collected articles a must-have... The reader&#x27;s delight will grow as hints are dropped that there is a great deal more to come in this series being prepared by Kripke and an ace team of philosopher-editors at the Saul Kripke Center at The Graduate Center of the City University of New York.&quot;

<doc id="48041" wikidata="Q83188" url="?curid=48041" title="Relativism">
<text>Relativism is a family of philosophical views which deny claims to objectivity within a particular domain and assert that valuations in that domain are relative to the perspective of an observer or the context in which they are assessed. There are many different forms of relativism, with a great deal of variation in scope and differing degrees of controversy among them. &quot;Moral relativism&quot; encompasses the differences in moral judgments among people and cultures. &quot;Epistemic relativism&quot; holds that there are no absolute principles regarding normative belief, justification, or rationality, and that there are only relative ones. &quot;Alethic relativism&quot; (also factual relativism) is the doctrine that there are no absolute truths, i.e., that truth is always relative to some particular frame of reference, such as a language or a culture (cultural relativism), while linguistic relativism asserts that a language&#x27;s structures influence a speaker&#x27;s perceptions. Some forms of relativism also bear a resemblance to philosophical skepticism. &quot;Descriptive relativism&quot; seeks to describe the differences among cultures and people without evaluation, while normative relativism evaluates the word truthfulness of views within a given framework.

==Forms of relativism==
===Anthropological versus philosophical relativism===
Anthropological relativism refers to a methodological stance, in which the researcher suspends (or brackets) their own cultural prejudice while trying to understand beliefs or behaviors in their contexts. This has become known as methodological relativism, and concerns itself specifically with avoiding ethnocentrism or the application of one&#x27;s own cultural standards to the assessment of other cultures. This is also the basis of the so-called &quot;emic&quot; and &quot;etic&quot; distinction, in which:
* An &quot;emic&quot; or &quot;insider&quot; account of behavior is a description of a society in terms that are meaningful to the participant or actor&#x27;s own culture; an emic account is therefore culture-specific, and typically refers to what is considered &quot;common sense&quot; within the culture under observation.
* An &quot;etic&quot; or outsider account is a description of a society by an observer, in terms that can be applied to other cultures; that is, an etic account is culturally neutral, and typically refers to the conceptual framework of the social scientist. (This is complicated when it is scientific research itself that is under study, or when there is theoretical or terminological disagreement within the social sciences.)

Philosophical relativism, in contrast, asserts that the truth of a proposition depends on the metaphysical, or theoretical frame, or the instrumental method, or the context in which the proposition is expressed, or on the person, groups, or culture who interpret the proposition.

Methodological relativism and philosophical relativism can exist independently from one another, but most anthropologists base their methodological relativism on that of the philosophical variety.

===Descriptive versus normative relativism===
The concept of relativism also has importance both for philosophers and for anthropologists in another way. In general, anthropologists engage in descriptive relativism (&quot;how things are&quot; or &quot;how things seem&quot;), whereas philosophers engage in normative relativism (&quot;how things ought to be&quot;), although there is some overlap (for example, descriptive relativism can pertain to concepts, normative relativism to truth).

Descriptive relativism assumes that certain cultural groups have different modes of thought, standards of reasoning, and so forth, and it is the anthropologist&#x27;s task to describe, but not to evaluate the validity of these principles and practices of a cultural group. It is possible for an anthropologist in his or her fieldwork to be a descriptive relativist about some things that typically concern the philosopher (e.g., ethical principles) but not about others (e.g., logical principles). However, the descriptive relativist&#x27;s empirical claims about epistemic principles, moral ideals and the like are often countered by anthropological arguments that such things are universal, and much of the recent literature on these matters is explicitly concerned with the extent of, and evidence for, cultural or moral or linguistic or human universals.

The fact that the various species of descriptive relativism are empirical claims may tempt the philosopher to conclude that they are of little philosophical interest, but there are several reasons why this is not so. First, some philosophers, notably Kant, argue that certain sorts of cognitive differences between human beings (or even all rational beings) are impossible, so such differences could never be found to obtain in fact, an argument that places a priori limits on what empirical inquiry could discover and on what versions of descriptive relativism could be true. Second, claims about actual differences between groups play a central role in some arguments for normative relativism (for example, arguments for normative ethical relativism often begin with claims that different groups in fact have different moral codes or ideals). Finally, the anthropologist&#x27;s descriptive account of relativism helps to separate the fixed aspects of human nature from those that can vary, and so a descriptive claim that some important aspect of experience or thought does (or does not) vary across groups of human beings tells us something important about human nature and the human condition.

Normative relativism concerns normative or evaluative claims that modes of thought, standards of reasoning, or the like are only right or wrong relative to a framework. &#x27;Normative&#x27; is meant in a general sense, applying to a wide range of views; in the case of beliefs, for example, normative correctness equals truth. This does not mean, of course, that framework-relative correctness or truth is always clear, the first challenge being to explain what it amounts to in any given case (e.g., with respect to concepts, truth, epistemic norms). Normative relativism (say, in regard to normative ethical relativism) therefore implies that things (say, ethical claims) are not simply true in themselves, but only have truth values relative to broader frameworks (say, moral codes). (Many normative ethical relativist arguments run from premises about ethics to conclusions that assert the relativity of truth values, bypassing general claims about the nature of truth, but it is often more illuminating to consider the type of relativism under question directly.)

===Legal relativism===
In English common law, two (perhaps three) separate standards of proof are recognized:
* proof based on the balance of probabilities is the lesser standard used in civil litigation, which cases mostly concern money or some other penalty, that, if further and better evidence should emerge, is reasonably reversible.
* proof beyond reasonable doubt is used in criminal law cases where an accused&#x27;s right to personal freedom or survival is in question, because such punishment is not reasonably reversible.
* Absolute truth is so complex as to be only capable of being fully understood by the omniscient established during the Tudor period as the one true God 

==Related and contrasting positions==
Relationism is the theory that there are only relations between individual entities, and no intrinsic
properties. Despite the similarity in name, it is held by some to be a position distinct from relativism—for instance, because &quot;statements about relational properties [...] assert an absolute truth about things in the world&quot;.
On the other hand, others wish to equate relativism, relationism and even relativity, which is a precise theory of relationships between physical objects: Nevertheless, &quot;This confluence of relativity theory with relativism became a strong contributing factor in the increasing prominence of relativism&quot;.

Whereas previous investigations of science only sought sociological or psychological explanations of failed scientific theories or pathological science, the &#x27;strong programme&#x27; is more relativistic, assessing scientific truth and falsehood equally in a historic and cultural context.

==Criticisms==
A common argument against relativism suggests that it inherently refutes itself: the statement &quot;all is relative&quot; classes either as a relative statement or as an absolute one. If it is relative, then this statement does not rule out absolutes. If the statement is , on the other hand, then it provides an example of an absolute statement, proving that not all truths are relative. However, this argument against relativism only applies to relativism that positions truth as relative–i.e. epistemological/truth-value relativism. More specifically, it is only extreme forms of epistemological relativism that can come in for this criticism as there are many epistemological relativists who posit that some aspects of what is regarded as factually &quot;true&quot; are not universal, yet still accept that other universal truths exist (e.g. gas laws or moral laws).

Another argument against relativism posits the existence of natural law. Simply put, the physical universe works under basic principles: the &quot;Laws of Nature&quot;. Some contend that a natural moral law may also exist, for example as argued by, Immanuel Kant in &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot;, Richard Dawkins in &quot;The God Delusion&quot; (2006) and addressed by C. S. Lewis in &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; (1952). Dawkins said &quot;I think we face an equal but much more sinister challenge from the left, in the shape of cultural relativism - the view that scientific truth is only one kind of truth and it is not to be especially privileged&quot;.
Philosopher Hilary Putnam, among others, states that some forms of relativism make it impossible to believe one is in error. If there is no truth beyond an individual&#x27;s belief that something is true, then an individual cannot hold their own beliefs to be false or mistaken. A related criticism is that relativizing truth to individuals destroys the distinction between truth and belief.

==Views==
===Philosophical===
====Ancient====

=====Sophism=====
Sophists are considered the founding fathers of relativism in Western philosophy. Elements of relativism emerged among the Sophists in the 5th century BC. Notably, it was Protagoras who coined the phrase, &quot;Man is the measure of all things: of things which are, that they are, and of things which are not, that they are not.&quot; The thinking of the Sophists is mainly known through their opponent, Plato. In a paraphrase from Plato&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Theaetetus&quot;, Protagoras said: &quot;What is true for you is true for you, and what is true for me is true for me.&quot;

====Modern====
=====Bernard Crick=====
Bernard Crick, a British political scientist and advocate of relativism, suggested in &quot;In Defence of Politics&quot; (1962) that moral conflict between people is inevitable. He thought that only ethics can resolve such conflict, and when that occurs in public it results in politics. Accordingly, Crick saw the process of dispute resolution, harms reduction, mediation or peacemaking as central to all of moral philosophy. He became an important influence on feminists and later on the Greens.

=====Paul Feyerabend=====
Philosopher of science Paul Feyerabend is often considered to be a relativist, although he denied being one.

Feyerabend argued that modern science suffers from being methodologically monistic (the belief that only a single methodology can produce scientific progress). Feyerabend summarises his case in &quot;Against Method&quot; with the phrase &quot;anything goes&quot;.

:In an aphorism [Feyerabend] often repeated, &quot;potentially every culture is all cultures&quot;. This is intended to convey that world views are not hermetically closed, since their leading concepts have an &quot;ambiguity&quot; - better, an open-endedness - which enables people from other cultures to engage with them. [...] It follows that relativism, understood as the doctrine that truth is relative to closed systems, can get no purchase. [...] For Feyerabend, both hermetic relativism and its absolutist rival [realism] serve, in their different ways, to &quot;devalue human existence&quot;. The former encourages that unsavoury brand of political correctness which takes the refusal to criticise &quot;other cultures&quot; to the extreme of condoning murderous dictatorship and barbaric practices. The latter, especially in its favoured contemporary form of &quot;scientific realism&quot;, with the excessive prestige it affords to the abstractions of &quot;the monster &#x27;science&#x27;&quot;, is in bed with a politics which likewise disdains variety, richness and everyday individuality - a politics which likewise &quot;hides&quot; its norms behind allegedly neutral facts, &quot;blunts choices and imposes laws&quot;.

=====Thomas Kuhn=====
Thomas Kuhn&#x27;s philosophy of science, as expressed in &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;, is often interpreted as relativistic. He claimed that, as well as progressing steadily and incrementally (&quot;normal science&quot;), science undergoes periodic revolutions or &quot;paradigm shifts&quot;, leaving scientists working in different paradigms with difficulty in even communicating. Thus the truth of a claim, or the existence of a posited entity, is relative to the paradigm employed. However, it is not necessary for him to embrace relativism because every paradigm presupposes the prior, building upon itself through history and so on. This leads to there being a fundamental, incremental, and referential structure of development which is not relative but again, fundamental.

:From these remarks, one thing is however certain: Kuhn is not saying that incommensurable theories cannot be compared - what they can&#x27;t be is compared in terms of a system of common measure. He very plainly says that they can be compared, and he reiterates this repeatedly in later work, in a (mostly in vain) effort to avert the crude and sometimes catastrophic misinterpretations he suffered from mainstream philosophers and post-modern relativists alike.

But Kuhn rejected the accusation of being a relativist later in his postscript:

:scientific development is ... a unidirectional and irreversible process. Later scientific theories are better than earlier ones for solving puzzles ... That is not a relativist&#x27;s position, and it displays the sense in which I am a convinced believer in scientific progress.

Some have argued that one can also read Kuhn&#x27;s work as essentially positivist in its ontology: the revolutions he posits are epistemological, lurching toward a presumably &#x27;better&#x27; understanding of an objective reality through the lens presented by the new paradigm. However, a number of passages in &quot;Structure&quot; do indeed appear to be distinctly relativist, and to directly challenge the notion of an objective reality and the ability of science to progress towards an ever-greater grasp of it, particularly through the process of paradigm change.

:In the sciences there need not be progress of another sort. We may, to be more precise, have to relinquish the notion, explicit or implicit, that changes of paradigm carry scientists and those who learn from them closer and closer to the truth.

:We are all deeply accustomed to seeing science as the one enterprise that draws constantly nearer to some goal set by nature in advance. But need there be any such goal? Can we not account for both science&#x27;s existence and its success in terms of evolution from the community&#x27;s state of knowledge at any given time? Does it really help to imagine that there is some one full, objective, true account of nature and that the proper measure of scientific achievement is the extent to which it brings us closer to that ultimate goal?

=====George Lakoff and Mark Johnson=====
George Lakoff and Mark Johnson define relativism in &quot;Metaphors We Live By&quot; as the rejection of both subjectivism and metaphysical objectivism in order to focus on the relationship between them, i.e. the metaphor by which we relate our current experience to our previous experience. In particular, Lakoff and Johnson characterize &quot;objectivism&quot; as a &quot;straw man&quot;, and, to a lesser degree, criticize the views of Karl Popper, Kant and Aristotle.

===== Robert Nozick =====
In his book &quot;Invariances&quot;, Robert Nozick expresses a complex set of theories about the absolute and the relative. He thinks the absolute/relative distinction should be recast in terms of an invariant/variant distinction, where there are many things a proposition can be invariant with regard to or vary with. He thinks it is coherent for truth to be relative, and speculates that it might vary with time. He thinks necessity is an unobtainable notion, but can be approximated by robust invariance across a variety of conditions—although we can never identify a proposition that is invariant with regard to everything. Finally, he is not particularly warm to one of the most famous forms of relativism, moral relativism, preferring an evolutionary account.

=====Joseph Margolis=====
Joseph Margolis advocates a view he calls &quot;robust relativism&quot; and defends it in his books &quot;Historied Thought, Constructed World&quot;, Chapter 4 (California, 1995) and &quot;The Truth about Relativism&quot; (Blackwell, 1991). He opens his account by stating that our logics should depend on what we take to be the nature of the sphere to which we wish to apply our logics. Holding that there can be no distinctions which are not &quot;privileged&quot; between the alethic, the ontic, and the epistemic, he maintains that a many-valued logic just might be the most apt for aesthetics or history since, because in these practices, we are loath to hold to simple binary logic; and he also holds that many-valued logic is relativistic. (This is perhaps an unusual definition of &quot;relativistic&quot;. Compare with his comments on &quot;relationism&quot;.) To say that &quot;True&quot; and &quot;False&quot; are mutually exclusive and exhaustive judgements on &quot;Hamlet&quot;, for instance, really does seem absurd. A many-valued logicwith its values &quot;apt&quot;, &quot;reasonable&quot;, &quot;likely&quot;, and so onseems intuitively more applicable to interpreting &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Where apparent contradictions arise between such interpretations, we might call the interpretations &quot;incongruent&quot;, rather than dubbing either of them &quot;false&quot;, because using many-valued logic implies that a measured value is a mixture of two extreme possibilities. Using the subset of many-valued logic, fuzzy logic, it can be said that various interpretations can be represented by membership in more than one possible truth set simultaneously. Fuzzy logic is therefore probably the best mathematical structure for understanding &quot;robust relativism&quot; and has been interpreted by Bart Kosko as philosophically being related to Zen Buddhism.

It was Aristotle who held that relativism implies that we should, sticking with appearances only, end up contradicting ourselves somewhere if we could apply all attributes to all &quot;ousiai&quot; (beings). Aristotle, however, made non-contradiction dependent upon his essentialism. If his essentialism is false, then so too is his ground for disallowing relativism. (Subsequent philosophers have found other reasons for supporting the principle of non-contradiction.)

Beginning with Protagoras and invoking Charles Sanders Peirce, Margolis shows that the historic struggle to discredit relativism is an attempt to impose an unexamined belief in the world&#x27;s essentially rigid rule-like nature. Plato and Aristotle merely attacked &quot;relationalism&quot;the doctrine of true for l or true for k, and the like, where l and k are different speakers or different worldsor something similar (most philosophers would call this position &quot;relativism&quot;). For Margolis, &quot;true&quot; means true; that is, the alethic use of &quot;true&quot; remains untouched. However, in real world contexts, and context is ubiquitous in the real world, we must apply truth values. Here, in epistemic terms, we might &quot;tout court&quot; retire &quot;true&quot; as an evaluation and keep &quot;false&quot;. The rest of our value-judgements could be graded from &quot;extremely plausible&quot; down to &quot;false&quot;. Judgements which on a bivalent logic would be incompatible or contradictory are further seen as &quot;incongruent&quot;, although one may well have more weight than the other. In short, relativistic logic is not, or need not be, the bugbear it is often presented to be. It may simply be the best type of logic to apply to certain very uncertain spheres of real experiences in the world (although some sort of logic needs to be applied in order to make that judgement). Those who swear by bivalent logic might simply be the ultimate keepers of the great fear of the flux.

=====Richard Rorty=====
Philosopher Richard Rorty has a somewhat paradoxical role in the debate over relativism: he is criticized for his relativistic views by many commentators, but has always denied that relativism applies to much anybody, being nothing more than a Platonic scarecrow. Rorty claims, rather, that he is a pragmatist, and that to construe pragmatism as relativism is to beg the question.

:&#x27;&quot;Relativism&quot; is the traditional epithet applied to pragmatism by realists&#x27;

:&#x27;&quot;Relativism&quot; is the view that every belief on a certain topic, or perhaps about any topic, is as good as every other. No one holds this view. Except for the occasional cooperative freshman, one cannot find anybody who says that two incompatible opinions on an important topic are equally good. The philosophers who get called &#x27;relativists&#x27; are those who say that the grounds for choosing between such opinions are less algorithmic than had been thought.&#x27;

:&#x27;In short, my strategy for escaping the self-referential difficulties into which &quot;the Relativist&quot; keeps getting himself is to move everything over from epistemology and metaphysics into cultural politics, from claims to knowledge and appeals to self-evidence to suggestions about what we should try.&#x27;

Rorty takes a deflationary attitude to truth, believing there is nothing of interest to be said about truth in general, including the contention that it is generally subjective. He also argues that the notion of warrant or justification can do most of the work traditionally assigned to the concept of truth, and that justification &quot;is&quot; relative; justification is justification to an audience, for Rorty.

In &quot;Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity&quot; he argues that the debate between so-called relativists and so-called objectivists is beside the point because they do not have enough premises in common for either side to prove anything to the other.

===== Nalin de Silva =====
In his book &quot;Mage Lokaya&quot; (My World), 1986, Nalin de Silva criticized the basis of the established western system of knowledge, and its propagation, which he refers as &quot;domination throughout the world&quot;.He explained in this book that mind independent reality is impossible and knowledge is not found but constructed. Further he has introduced and developed the concept of &quot;Constructive Relativism&quot; as the basis on which knowledge is constructed relative to the sense organs, culture and the mind completely based on Avidya.

====Postmodernism====
The term &quot;relativism&quot; often comes up in debates over postmodernism, poststructuralism and phenomenology. Critics of these perspectives often identify advocates with the label &quot;relativism&quot;. For example, the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis is often considered a relativist view because it posits that linguistic categories and structures shape the way people view the world. Stanley Fish has defended postmodernism and relativism.

These perspectives do not strictly count as relativist in the philosophical sense, because they express agnosticism on the nature of reality and make epistemological rather than ontological claims. Nevertheless, the term is useful to differentiate them from realists who believe that the purpose of philosophy, science, or literary critique is to locate externally true meanings. Important philosophers and theorists such as Michel Foucault, Max Stirner, political movements such as post-anarchism or post-Marxism can also be considered as relativist in this sense - though a better term might be social constructivist.

The spread and popularity of this kind of &quot;soft&quot; relativism varies between academic disciplines. It has wide support in anthropology and has a majority following in cultural studies. It also has advocates in political theory and political science, sociology, and continental philosophy (as distinct from Anglo-American analytical philosophy). It has inspired empirical studies of the social construction of meaning such as those associated with labelling theory, which defenders can point to as evidence of the validity of their theories (albeit risking accusations of performative contradiction in the process). Advocates of this kind of relativism often also claim that recent developments in the natural sciences, such as Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle, quantum mechanics, chaos theory and complexity theory show that science is now becoming relativistic. However, many scientists who use these methods continue to identify as realist or post-positivist, and some sharply criticize the association.

===Religious===
====Buddhism====
Madhyamaka Buddhism, which forms the basis for many Mahayana Buddhist schools and which was founded by Nāgārjuna. Nāgārjuna taught the idea of relativity. In the Ratnāvalī, he gives the example that shortness exists only in relation to the idea of length. The determination of a thing or object is only possible in relation to other things or objects, especially by way of contrast. He held that the relationship between the ideas of &quot;short&quot; and &quot;long&quot; is not due to intrinsic nature (svabhāva). This idea is also found in the Pali Nikāyas and Chinese Āgamas, in which the idea of relativity is expressed similarly: &quot;That which is the element of light ... is seen to exist on account of [in relation to] darkness; that which is the element of good is seen to exist on account of bad; that which is the element of space is seen to exist on account of form.&quot;

Madhyamaka Buddhism discerns two levels of truth: relative and ultimate. The two truths doctrine states that there are &quot;Relative&quot; or conventional, common-sense truth, which describes our daily experience of a concrete world, and &quot;Ultimate&quot; truth, which describes the ultimate reality as &quot;sunyata&quot;, empty of concrete and inherent characteristics. Conventional truth may be understood, in contrast, as &quot;obscurative truth&quot; or &quot;that which obscures the true nature&quot;. It is constituted by the appearances of mistaken awareness. Conventional truth would be the appearance that includes a duality of apprehender and apprehended, and objects perceived within that. Ultimate truth is the phenomenal world free from the duality of apprehender and apprehended.

==== Catholicism ====
The Catholic Church, especially under John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI, has identified relativism as one of the most significant problems for faith and morals today.

According to the Church and to some theologians, relativism, as a denial of absolute truth, leads to moral license and a denial of the possibility of sin and of God. Whether moral or epistemological, relativism constitutes a denial of the capacity of the human mind and reason to arrive at truth. Truth, according to Catholic theologians and philosophers (following Aristotle) consists of &quot;adequatio rei et intellectus&quot;, the correspondence of the mind and reality. Another way of putting it states that the mind has the same form as reality. This means when the form of the computer in front of someone (the type, color, shape, capacity, etc.) is also the form that is in their mind, then what they know is true because their mind corresponds to objective reality.

The denial of an absolute reference, of an &quot;axis mundi&quot;, denies God, who equates to Absolute Truth, according to these Christian theologians. They link relativism to secularism, an obstruction of religion in human life.

=====Leo XIII=====
Pope Leo XIII (1810–1903) was the first known Pope to use the word &quot;relativism&quot;, in his encyclical &quot;Humanum genus&quot; (1884). Leo condemned Freemasonry and claimed that its philosophical and political system was largely based on relativism.

=====John Paul II=====
John Paul II wrote in &quot;Veritatis Splendor&quot;

:As is immediately evident, the crisis of truth is not unconnected with this development. Once the idea of a universal truth about the good, knowable by human reason, is lost, inevitably the notion of conscience also changes. Conscience is no longer considered in its primordial reality as an act of a person&#x27;s intelligence, the function of which is to apply the universal knowledge of the good in a specific situation and thus to express a judgment about the right conduct to be chosen here and now. Instead, there is a tendency to grant to the individual conscience the prerogative of independently determining the criteria of good and evil and then acting accordingly. Such an outlook is quite congenial to an individualist ethic, wherein each individual is faced with his own truth, different from the truth of others. Taken to its extreme consequences, this individualism leads to a denial of the very idea of human nature.

In &quot;Evangelium Vitae&quot; (The Gospel of Life), he says:

:Freedom negates and destroys itself, and becomes a factor leading to the destruction of others, when it no longer recognizes and respects its essential link with the truth. When freedom, out of a desire to emancipate itself from all forms of tradition and authority, shuts out even the most obvious evidence of an objective and universal truth, which is the foundation of personal and social life, then the person ends up by no longer taking as the sole and indisputable point of reference for his own choices the truth about good and evil, but only his subjective and changeable opinion or, indeed, his selfish interest and whim.

===== Benedict XVI =====
In April 2005, in his homily during Mass prior to the conclave which would elect him as Pope, then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger talked about the world &quot;moving towards a dictatorship of relativism&quot;:

:How many winds of doctrine we have known in recent decades, how many ideological currents, how many ways of thinking. The small boat of thought of many Christians has often been tossed about by these waves – thrown from one extreme to the other: from Marxism to liberalism, even to libertinism; from collectivism to radical individualism; from atheism to a vague religious mysticism; from agnosticism to syncretism, and so forth. Every day new sects are created and what Saint Paul says about human trickery comes true, with cunning which tries to draw those into error (cf Ephesians 4, 14). Having a clear Faith, based on the Creed of the Church, is often labeled today as a fundamentalism. Whereas, relativism, which is letting oneself be tossed and &quot;swept along by every wind of teaching&quot;, looks like the only attitude acceptable to today&#x27;s standards. We are moving towards a dictatorship of relativism which does not recognize anything as certain and which has as its highest goal one&#x27;s own ego and one&#x27;s own desires. However, we have a different goal: the Son of God, true man. He is the measure of true humanism. Being an &quot;Adult&quot; means having a faith which does not follow the waves of today&#x27;s fashions or the latest novelties. A faith which is deeply rooted in friendship with Christ is adult and mature. It is this friendship which opens us up to all that is good and gives us the knowledge to judge true from false, and deceit from truth.

On June 6, 2005, Pope Benedict XVI told educators:

:Today, a particularly insidious obstacle to the task of education is the massive presence in our society and culture of that relativism which, recognizing nothing as definitive, leaves as the ultimate criterion only the self with its desires. And under the semblance of freedom it becomes a prison for each one, for it separates people from one another, locking each person into his or her own &#x27;ego&#x27;.

Then during the World Youth Day in August 2005, he also traced to relativism the problems produced by the communist and sexual revolutions, and provided a counter-counter argument.

:In the last century we experienced revolutions with a common programme–expecting nothing more from God, they assumed total responsibility for the cause of the world in order to change it. And this, as we saw, meant that a human and partial point of view was always taken as an absolute guiding principle. Absolutizing what is not absolute but relative is called totalitarianism. It does not liberate man, but takes away his dignity and enslaves him. It is not ideologies that save the world, but only a return to the living God, our Creator, the Guarantor of our freedom, the Guarantor of what is really good and true.

=====Pope Francis=====
Pope Francis refers in &quot;Evangelii gaudium&quot; to two forms of relativism, &quot;doctrinal relativism&quot; and a &quot;practical relativism&quot; typical of &quot;our age&quot;. The latter is allied to &quot;widespread indifference&quot; to systems of belief.

==== Jainism ====
Mahavira (599-527 BC), the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism, developed a philosophy known as Anekantavada. John Koller describes &quot;anekāntavāda&quot; as &quot;epistemological respect for view of others&quot; about the nature of existence, whether it is &quot;inherently enduring or constantly changing&quot;, but &quot;not relativism; it does not mean conceding that all arguments and all views are equal&quot;.

====Sikhism====
In Sikhism the Gurus (spiritual teachers) have propagated the message of &quot;many paths&quot; leading to the one God and ultimate salvation for all souls who tread on the path of righteousness. They have supported the view that proponents of all faiths can, by doing good and virtuous deeds and by remembering the Lord, certainly achieve salvation. The students of the Sikh faith are told to accept all leading faiths as possible vehicles for attaining spiritual enlightenment provided the faithful study, ponder and practice the teachings of their prophets and leaders. The holy book of the Sikhs called the Sri Guru Granth Sahib says: &quot;Do not say that the Vedas, the Bible and the Koran are false. Those who do not contemplate them are false.&quot; Guru Granth Sahib page 1350; later stating: &quot;The seconds, minutes, and hours, days, weeks and months, and the various seasons originate from the one Sun; O nanak, in just the same way, the many forms originate from the Creator.&quot; Guru Granth Sahib page 12,13.

<text>In computer networking, a routing table, or routing information base (RIB), is a data table stored in a router or a network host that lists the routes to particular network destinations, and in some cases, metrics (distances) associated with those routes. The routing table contains information about the topology of the network immediately around it.

The construction of routing tables is the primary goal of routing protocols. Static routes are entries that are fixed, rather than resulting from routing protocols and network topology discovery procedures.

==Overview==
A routing table is analogous to a distribution map in package delivery. Whenever a node needs to send data to another node on a network, it must first know &quot;where&quot; to send it. If the node cannot directly connect to the destination node, it has to send it via other nodes along a route to the destination node. Each node needs to keep track of which way to deliver various packages of data, and for this it uses a routing table. A routing table is a database that keeps track of paths, like a map, and uses these to determine which way to forward traffic. A routing table is a data file in RAM that is used to store route information about directly connected and remote networks. Nodes can also share the contents of their routing table with other nodes.

The primary function of a router is to forward a packet toward its destination network, which is the destination IP address of the packet. To do this, a router needs to search the routing information stored in its routing table. The routing table contains network/next hop associations. These associations tell a router that a particular destination can be optimally reached by sending the packet to a specific router that represents the next hop on the way to the final destination. The next hop association can also be the outgoing or exit interface to the final destination.

With hop-by-hop routing, each routing table lists, for all reachable destinations, the address of the next device along the path to that destination: the next hop. Assuming that the routing tables are consistent, the simple algorithm of relaying packets to their destination&#x27;s next hop thus suffices to deliver data anywhere in a network. Hop-by-hop is the fundamental characteristic of the IP Internet layer and the OSI Network Layer.

When a router interface is configured with an IP address and subnet mask, the interface becomes a host on that attached network. A directly connected network is a network that is directly attached to one of the router interfaces. The network address and subnet mask of the interface, along with the interface type and number, are entered into the routing table as a directly connected network.

A remote network is a network that can only be reached by sending the packet to another router. Routing table entries to remote networks may be either dynamic or static. Dynamic routes are routes to remote networks that were learned automatically by the router through a dynamic routing protocol. Static routes are routes that a network administrator manually configured.

Routing tables are also a key aspect of certain security operations, such as unicast reverse path forwarding (uRPF). In this technique, which has several variants, the router also looks up, in the routing table, the &quot;source address&quot; of the packet. If there exists no route back to the source address, the packet is assumed to be malformed or involved in a network attack and is dropped.

==Difficulties==
The need to record routes to large numbers of devices using limited storage space represents a major challenge in routing table construction. In the Internet, the currently dominant address aggregation technology is a bitwise prefix matching scheme called Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). Supernetworks can also be used to help control routing table size.

==Contents==
The routing table consists of at least three information fields:
#&quot;network identifier&quot;: The destination subnet and netmask
#&quot;metric&quot;: The routing metric of the path through which the packet is to be sent. The route will go in the direction of the gateway with the lowest metric.
#&quot;next hop&quot;: The next hop, or gateway, is the address of the next station to which the packet is to be sent on the way to its final destination

Depending on the application and implementation, it can also contain additional values that refine path selection: 
#&quot;quality of service&quot; associated with the route. For example, the U flag indicates that an IP route is up.
#&quot;filtering criteria&quot;: Access-control lists associated with the route
#&quot;interface&quot;: Such as eth0 for the first Ethernet card, eth1 for the second Ethernet card, etc.

Shown below is an example of what the table above could look like on a computer connected to the internet via a home router:

* The columns Network destination and Netmask together describe the Network identifier as mentioned earlier. For example, destination 192.168.0.0 and netmask 255.255.255.0 can be written as 192.168.0.0/24. 
* The Gateway column contains the same information as the Next hop, i.e. it points to the gateway through which the network can be reached. 
* The Interface indicates what locally available interface is responsible for reaching the gateway. In this example, gateway 192.168.0.1 (the internet router) can be reached through the local network card with address 192.168.0.100. 
* Finally, the Metric indicates the associated cost of using the indicated route. This is useful for determining the efficiency of a certain route from two points in a network. In this example, it is more efficient to communicate with the computer itself through the use of address 127.0.0.1 (called &quot;localhost&quot;) than it would be through 192.168.0.100 (the IP address of the local network card).

==Forwarding table==
Routing tables are generally not used directly for packet forwarding in modern router architectures; instead, they are used to generate the information for a simpler forwarding table. This forwarding table contains only the routes which are chosen by the routing algorithm as preferred routes for packet forwarding. It is often in a compressed or pre-compiled format that is optimized for hardware storage and lookup.

This router architecture separates the control plane function of the routing table from the forwarding plane function of the forwarding table. This separation of control and forwarding provides uninterrupted high-performance forwarding.

<doc id="48044" wikidata="Q17035059" url="?curid=48044" title="Transcendental argument for the existence of God">
<text>The Transcendental Argument for the existence of God (TAG) is an argument that attempts to prove the existence of God by appealing to the necessary conditions for the possibility of experience and knowledge.

A version was formulated by Immanuel Kant in his 1763 work &quot;The Only Possible Argument in Support of a Demonstration of the Existence of God.&quot; C. S. Lewis&#x27;s argument from reason is also a kind of transcendental argument.

Most contemporary formulations of a transcendental argument for God have been developed within the framework of Christian presuppositional apologetics and the likes of Cornelius Van Til and Greg Bahnsen.

==Transcendental reasoning==

&quot;Transcendental&quot; in this case is used as an adjective specifying a specific kind of argument, and not a noun. Transcendental arguments should not be confused with arguments for the existence of something transcendent. Rather, transcendental arguments are arguments that make inferences from the ability to think and experience.

So-called &quot;progressive&quot; transcendental arguments begin with an apparently indubitable and universally accepted statement about people&#x27;s experiences of the world. They use this to make substantive knowledge-claims about the world, e.g., that it &quot;is&quot; causally and spatiotemporally related. They start with what is left at the &quot;end&quot; of the skeptic&#x27;s process of doubting.

Progressive transcendental arguments take the form of modus ponens with modal operators:

:If possibly &quot;P&quot;, then necessarily &quot;Q&quot;.
:Actually &quot;P&quot;.
:Therefore, necessarily &quot;Q&quot;.

&quot;Regressive&quot; transcendental arguments, on the other hand, &quot;begin at the same point&quot; as the skeptic, e.g., the fact that we have experience of a causal and spatiotemporal world, and show that certain notions are implicit in our conceptions of such experience. Regressive transcendental arguments are more conservative in that they do not purport to make substantive ontological claims about the world.

Regressive transcendental arguments take the form of modus tollens with modal operators:

:If possibly &quot;P&quot;, then necessarily &quot;Q&quot;.
:Actually not &quot;Q&quot;.
:Therefore, necessarily not &quot;P&quot;.

They are also sometimes said to be distinct from standard deductive and inductive forms of reasoning, although this has been disputed, for instance by Anthony Genova and Graham Bird.

==The argument==
There are many versions of the transcendental argument for the existence of God (both progressive and regressive), but they generally proceed as follows:

# If there is a transcendental unity of apperception, God exists.
# There is a transcendental unity of apperception.
# Therefore, God exists.

The transcendental unity of apperception refers to the combination of different impressions, experiences and categories into a single, intelligible consciousness held by a person. It is argued that the negation of the existence of God therefore entails the impossibility of knowledge, which is self-refuting.

The TAG differs from thomistic and evidentialist arguments, which presuppose the validity of human perception and judgement when proving the existence of God.

==Ash&#x27;ari==

Medieval Ash&#x27;ari Islamic theologians formulated a type of transcendental argument based on the notion that morality, logic, etc. cannot be fully understood apart from revelation and thereby, belief in the Quran and the Islamic truth claims were necessary in order to interpret the external world. For al-Ashari and others, it does not make sense to argue against religion using a priori assumptions about morality or scientific probabilities when these can only be understood in light of divine revelation.

==Criticism==
Barry Stroud has criticized transcendental arguments, distinguishing between epistemic (what we must presuppose) and metaphysical (what actually exists) transcendental arguments. Stroud argues that transcendental arguments often only establish the former but assert the latter, so TAG, as a metaphysical transcendental argument, can only establish that human thought presupposes logic, science, and morality, but attempting to ground them in something beyond human thought, such as God, ultimately fails.

=== Presuppositional apologetics ===
Internet Infidels co-founder Jeffery Jay Lowder has argued that the presuppositional apologetics&#x27; version of TAG is fatally flawed for numerous reasons. First, Bahnsen fails to defend the &quot;necessity&quot; of Christianity instead of the mere &quot;sufficiency&quot; for the rational justification of the laws of logic, the laws of science, and the laws of morality. In other words, such reasoning affirms the consequent.
Second, Bahnsen conflates &quot;atheism&quot; with &quot;materialism&quot; and has really presented an argument against materialism, not an argument for Christianity. Third, Bahnsen believed that the laws of logic, laws of science, and laws of morality are abstract objects, but Christianity arguably underdetermines the relationship between God and abstract objects. Some Christian philosophers, such as Peter van Inwagen, affirm Platonism and the compatibility of God and abstract objects. But other Christian philosophers argue that Platonism is incompatible with divine aseity. William Lane Craig urges Christian philosophers to consider anti-realist theories of abstract objects.

<doc id="48046" wikidata="Q107342" url="?curid=48046" title="Syllogism">
<text>A syllogism (, &quot;syllogismos&quot;, &#x27;conclusion, inference&#x27;) is a kind of logical argument that applies deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion based on two propositions that are asserted or assumed to be true.
In its earliest form (defined by Aristotle in his 350 BC book &quot;Prior Analytics&quot;), a deductive syllogism arises when two true premises (propositions or statements) validly imply a conclusion, or the main point that the argument aims to get across. For example, knowing that all men are mortal (major premise), and that Socrates is a man (minor premise), we may validly conclude that Socrates is mortal. Syllogistic arguments are usually represented in a three-line form: 
&lt;poem&gt;All men are mortal.
Socrates is a man.
Therefore, Socrates is mortal.&lt;/poem&gt;In antiquity, two rival syllogistic theories existed: Aristotelian syllogism and Stoic syllogism. From the Middle Ages onwards, &quot;categorical syllogism&quot; and &quot;syllogism&quot; were usually used interchangeably. This article is concerned only with this historical use. The syllogism was at the core of historical deductive reasoning, whereby facts are determined by combining existing statements, in contrast to inductive reasoning, in which facts are predicted by repeated observations.

Within some academic contexts, syllogism has been superseded by first-order predicate logic following the work of Gottlob Frege, in particular his &quot;Begriffsschrift&quot; (&quot;Concept Script&quot;; 1879). Syllogism, being a method of valid logical reasoning, will always be useful in most circumstances, and for general-audience introductions to logic and clear-thinking.

==Early history==
In antiquity, two rival syllogistic theories existed: Aristotelian syllogism and Stoic syllogism.

===Aristotle===

Aristotle defines the syllogism as &quot;a discourse in which certain (specific) things having been supposed, something different from the things supposed results of necessity because these things are so.&quot; Despite this very general definition, in &quot;Prior Analytics&quot; Aristotle limits himself to categorical syllogisms that consist of three categorical propositions, including categorical modal syllogisms.

The use of syllogisms as a tool for understanding can be dated back to the logical reasoning discussions of Aristotle. Before the mid-12th century, medieval logicians were only familiar with a portion of Aristotle&#x27;s works, including such titles as &quot;Categories&quot; and &quot;On Interpretation&quot;, works that contributed heavily to the prevailing Old Logic, or &quot;logica vetus&quot;. The onset of a New Logic, or &quot;logica nova&quot;, arose alongside the reappearance of &quot;Prior Analytics&quot;, the work in which Aristotle developed his theory of the syllogism.

&quot;Prior Analytics&quot;, upon rediscovery, was instantly regarded by logicians as &quot;a closed and complete body of doctrine&quot;, leaving very little for thinkers of the day to debate, and reorganize. Aristotle&#x27;s theory on the syllogism for &quot;assertoric&quot; sentences was considered especially remarkable, with only small systematic changes occurring to the concept over time. This theory of the syllogism would not enter the context of the more comprehensive logic of consequence until logic began to be reworked in general in the mid-14th century by the likes of John Buridan.

Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Prior Analytics&quot; did not, however, incorporate such a comprehensive theory on the modal syllogism—a syllogism that has at least one modalized premise, that is, a premise containing the modal words &quot;necessarily&quot;, &quot;possibly&quot;, or &quot;contingently&quot;. Aristotle&#x27;s terminology in this aspect of his theory was deemed vague, and in many cases unclear, even contradicting some of his statements from &quot;On Interpretation&quot;. His original assertions on this specific component of the theory were left up to a considerable amount of conversation, resulting in a wide array of solutions put forth by commentators of the day. The system for modal syllogisms laid forth by Aristotle would ultimately be deemed unfit for practical use, and would be replaced by new distinctions and new theories altogether.

=== Medieval syllogism ===

====Boethius====

Boethius (c. 475–526) contributed an effort to make the ancient Aristotelian logic more accessible. While his Latin translation of &quot;Prior Analytics&quot; went primarily unused before the 12th century, his textbooks on the categorical syllogism were central to expanding the syllogistic discussion. Rather than in any additions that he personally made to the field, Boethius&#x27; logical legacy lies in his effective transmission of prior theories to later logicians, as well as his clear and primarily accurate presentations of Aristotle&#x27;s contributions.

====Peter Abelard====

Another of medieval logic&#x27;s first contributors from the Latin West, Peter Abelard (1079–1142), gave his own thorough evaluation of the syllogism concept, and accompanying theory in the &quot;Dialectica&quot;—a discussion of logic based on Boethius&#x27; commentaries and monographs. His perspective on syllogisms can be found in other works as well, such as &quot;Logica Ingredientibus&quot;. With the help of Abelard&#x27;s distinction between &quot;de dicto&quot; modal sentences and &quot;de re&quot; modal sentences, medieval logicians began to shape a more coherent concept of Aristotle&#x27;s modal syllogism model.

====Jean Buridan====

The French philosopher Jean Buridan (c. 1300 – 1361), whom some consider the foremost logician of the later Middle Ages, contributed two significant works: &quot;Treatise on Consequence&quot; and &quot;Summulae de Dialectica&quot;, in which he discussed the concept of the syllogism, its components and distinctions, and ways to use the tool to expand its logical capability. For 200 years after Buridan&#x27;s discussions, little was said about syllogistic logic. Historians of logic have assessed that the primary changes in the post-Middle Age era were changes in respect to the public&#x27;s awareness of original sources, a lessening of appreciation for the logic&#x27;s sophistication and complexity, and an increase in logical ignorance—so that logicians of the early 20th century came to view the whole system as ridiculous.

==Modern history==

The Aristotelian syllogism dominated Western philosophical thought for many centuries. Syllogism itself is about drawing valid conclusions from assumptions (axioms), rather than about verifying the assumptions. However, people over time focused on the logic aspect, forgetting the importance of verifying the assumptions.

In the 17th century, Francis Bacon emphasized that experimental verification of axioms must be carried out rigorously, and cannot take syllogism itself as the best way to draw conclusions in nature. Bacon proposed a more inductive approach to the observation of nature, which involves experimentation, and leads to discovering and building on axioms to create a more general conclusion. Yet, a full method of drawing conclusions in nature is not the scope of logic or syllogism, and the inductive method was covered in Aristotle&#x27;s subsequent treatise, the &quot;Posterior Analytics&quot;.

In the 19th century, modifications to syllogism were incorporated to deal with disjunctive (&quot;A or B&quot;) and conditional (&quot;if A then B&quot;) statements. Immanuel Kant famously claimed, in &quot;Logic&quot; (1800), that logic was the one completed science, and that Aristotelian logic more or less included everything about logic that there was to know. (This work is not necessarily representative of Kant&#x27;s mature philosophy, which is often regarded as an innovation to logic itself.) Kant&#x27;s opinion stood unchallenged in the West until 1879, when Gottlob Frege published his &quot;Begriffsschrift&quot; (&quot;Concept Script&quot;). This introduced a calculus, a method of representing categorical statements (and statements that are not provided for in syllogism as well) by the use of quantifiers and variables.

A noteworthy exception is the logic developed in Bernard Bolzano&#x27;s work &quot;Wissenschaftslehre&quot; (&quot;Theory of Science&quot;, 1837), the principles of which were applied as a direct critique of Kant, in the posthumously published work &quot;New Anti-Kant&quot; (1850). The work of Bolzano had been largely overlooked until the late 20th century, among other reasons, because of the intellectual environment at the time in Bohemia, which was then part of the Austrian Empire. In the last 20 years, Bolzano&#x27;s work has resurfaced and become subject of both translation and contemporary study.

This led to the rapid development of sentential logic and first-order predicate logic, subsuming syllogistic reasoning, which was, therefore, after 2000 years, suddenly considered obsolete by many. The Aristotelian system is explicated in modern fora of academia primarily in introductory material and historical study.

One notable exception to this modern relegation is the continued application of Aristotelian logic by officials of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and the Apostolic Tribunal of the Roman Rota, which still requires that any arguments crafted by Advocates be presented in syllogistic format.

===Boole&#x27;s acceptance of Aristotle===
George Boole&#x27;s unwavering acceptance of Aristotle&#x27;s logic is emphasized by the historian of logic John Corcoran in an accessible introduction to &quot;Laws of Thought&quot;. Corcoran also wrote a point-by-point comparison of &quot;Prior Analytics&quot; and &quot;Laws of Thought&quot;. According to Corcoran, Boole fully accepted and endorsed Aristotle&#x27;s logic. Boole&#x27;s goals were &quot;to go under, over, and beyond&quot; Aristotle&#x27;s logic by:

# providing it with mathematical foundations involving equations;
# extending the class of problems it could treat, as solving equations was added to assessing validity; and
# expanding the range of applications it could handle, such as expanding propositions of only two terms to those having arbitrarily many.

More specifically, Boole agreed with what Aristotle said; Boole&#x27;s &#x27;disagreements&#x27;, if they might be called that, concern what Aristotle did not say. First, in the realm of foundations, Boole reduced Aristotle&#x27;s four propositional forms to one form, the form of equations, which by itself was a revolutionary idea. Second, in the realm of logic&#x27;s problems, Boole&#x27;s addition of equation solving to logic—another revolutionary idea—involved Boole&#x27;s doctrine that Aristotle&#x27;s rules of inference (the &quot;perfect syllogisms&quot;) must be supplemented by rules for equation solving. Third, in the realm of applications, Boole&#x27;s system could handle multi-term propositions and arguments, whereas Aristotle could handle only two-termed subject-predicate propositions and arguments. For example, Aristotle&#x27;s system could not deduce: &quot;No quadrangle that is a square is a rectangle that is a rhombus&quot; from &quot;No square that is a quadrangle is a rhombus that is a rectangle&quot; or from &quot;No rhombus that is a rectangle is a square that is a quadrangle.&quot;

==Basic structure==
A categorical syllogism consists of three parts:
# Major premise
# Minor premise
# Conclusion/Consequent

Each part is a categorical proposition, and each categorical proposition contains two categorical terms. In Aristotle, each of the premises is in the form &quot;All S are P,&quot; &quot;Some S are P&quot;, &quot;No S are P&quot; or &quot;Some S are not P&quot;, where &quot;S&quot; is the subject-term and &quot;P&quot; is the predicate-term:

* &quot;All S are P,&quot; and &quot;No S are P&quot; are termed &quot;universal&quot; propositions;
* &quot;Some S are P&quot; and &quot;Some S are not P&quot; are termed &quot;particular&quot; propositions.

More modern logicians allow some variation. Each of the premises has one term in common with the conclusion: in a major premise, this is the &quot;major term&quot; (i.e., the predicate of the conclusion); in a minor premise, this is the &quot;minor term&quot; (i.e., the subject of the conclusion). For example:

:Major premise: All humans are mortal.
:Minor premise: All Greeks are humans.
:Conclusion/Consequent: All Greeks are mortal.

Each of the three distinct terms represents a category. From the example above, &quot;humans&quot;, &quot;mortal&quot;, and &quot;Greeks&quot;: &quot;mortal&quot; is the major term, and &quot;Greeks&quot; the minor term. The premises also have one term in common with each other, which is known as the &quot;middle term&quot;; in this example, &quot;humans&quot;. Both of the premises are universal, as is the conclusion.

:Major premise: All mortals die.
:Minor premise: All men are mortals.
:Conclusion/Consequent: All men die.

Here, the major term is &quot;die&quot;, the minor term is &quot;men&quot;, and the middle term is &quot;mortals&quot;. Again, both premises are universal, hence so is the conclusion.

=== Polysyllogism ===

A polysyllogism, or a sorites, is a form of argument in which a series of incomplete syllogisms is so arranged that the predicate of each premise forms the subject of the next until the subject of the first is joined with the predicate of the last in the conclusion. For example, one might argue that all lions are big cats, all big cats are predators, and all predators are carnivores. To conclude that therefore all lions are carnivores is to construct a sorites argument.

==Types==


There are infinitely many possible syllogisms, but only 256 logically distinct types and only 24 valid types (enumerated below). A syllogism takes the form (note: M – Middle, S – subject, P – predicate.):

:Major premise: All M are P.
:Minor premise: All S are M.
:Conclusion/Consequent: All S are P.

The premises and conclusion of a syllogism can be any of four types, which are labeled by letters as follows. The meaning of the letters is given by the table:

In &quot;Prior Analytics&quot;, Aristotle uses mostly the letters A, B, and C (Greek letters &quot;alpha&quot;, &quot;beta&quot;, and &quot;gamma&quot;) as term place holders, rather than giving concrete examples. It is traditional to use &quot;is&quot; rather than &quot;are&quot; as the copula, hence &quot;All A is B&quot; rather than &quot;All As are Bs&quot;. It is traditional and convenient practice to use a, e, i, o as infix operators so the categorical statements can be written succinctly. The following table shows the longer form, the succinct shorthand, and equivalent expressions in predicate logic:

The convention here is that the letter S is the subject of the conclusion, P is the predicate of the conclusion, and M is the middle term. The major premise links M with P and the minor premise links M with S. However, the middle term can be either the subject or the predicate of each premise where it appears. The differing positions of the major, minor, and middle terms gives rise to another classification of syllogisms known as the &quot;figure&quot;. Given that in each case the conclusion is S-P, the four figures are:

(Note, however, that, following Aristotle&#x27;s treatment of the figures, some logicians—e.g., Peter Abelard and Jean Buridan—reject the fourth figure as a figure distinct from the first.)

Putting it all together, there are 256 possible types of syllogisms (or 512 if the order of the major and minor premises is changed, though this makes no difference logically). Each premise and the conclusion can be of type A, E, I or O, and the syllogism can be any of the four figures. A syllogism can be described briefly by giving the letters for the premises and conclusion followed by the number for the figure. For example, the syllogism BARBARA below is AAA-1, or &quot;A-A-A in the first figure&quot;.

The vast majority of the 256 possible forms of syllogism are invalid (the conclusion does not follow logically from the premises). The table below shows the valid forms. Even some of these are sometimes considered to commit the existential fallacy, meaning they are invalid if they mention an empty category. These controversial patterns are marked in &quot;italics&quot;. All but four of the patterns in italics (felapton, darapti, fesapo and bamalip) are weakened moods, i.e. it is possible to draw a stronger conclusion from the premises.

The letters A, E, I, and O have been used since the medieval Schools to form mnemonic names for the forms as follows: &#x27;Barbara&#x27; stands for AAA, &#x27;Celarent&#x27; for EAE, etc.

Next to each premise and conclusion is a shorthand description of the sentence. So in AAI-3, the premise &quot;All squares are rectangles&quot; becomes &quot;MaP&quot;; the symbols mean that the first term (&quot;square&quot;) is the middle term, the second term (&quot;rectangle&quot;) is the predicate of the conclusion, and the relationship between the two terms is labeled &quot;a&quot; (All M are P).

The following table shows all syllogisms that are essentially different. The similar syllogisms share the same premises, just written in a different way. For example &quot;Some pets are kittens&quot; (SiM in Darii) could also be written as &quot;Some kittens are pets&quot; (MiS in Datisi).

In the Venn diagrams, the black areas indicate no elements, and the red areas indicate at least one element. In the predicate logic expressions, a horizontal bar over an expression means to negate (&quot;logical not&quot;) the result of that expression.

It is also possible to use graphs (consisting of vertices and edges) to evaluate syllogisms.

==Terms in syllogism==

With Aristotle, we may distinguish singular terms, such as &quot;Socrates&quot;, and general terms, such as &quot;Greeks&quot;. Aristotle further distinguished types (a) and (b):

Such a predication is known as a distributive, as opposed to non-distributive as in &quot;Greeks are numerous&quot;. It is clear that Aristotle&#x27;s syllogism works only for distributive predication, since we cannot reason &quot;All Greeks are animals, animals are numerous, therefore all Greeks are numerous&quot;. In Aristotle&#x27;s view singular terms were of type (a), and general terms of type (b). Thus, &quot;Men&quot; can be predicated of &quot;Socrates&quot; but &quot;Socrates&quot; cannot be predicated of anything. Therefore, for a term to be interchangeable—to be either in the subject or predicate position of a proposition in a syllogism—the terms must be general terms, or &quot;categorical terms&quot; as they came to be called. Consequently, the propositions of a syllogism should be categorical propositions (both terms general) and syllogisms that employ only categorical terms came to be called &quot;categorical syllogisms&quot;.

It is clear that nothing would prevent a singular term occurring in a syllogism—so long as it was always in the subject position—however, such a syllogism, even if valid, is not a categorical syllogism. An example is &quot;Socrates is a man, all men are mortal, therefore Socrates is mortal.&quot; Intuitively this is as valid as &quot;All Greeks are men, all men are mortal therefore all Greeks are mortals&quot;. To argue that its validity can be explained by the theory of syllogism would require that we show that &quot;Socrates is a man&quot; is the equivalent of a categorical proposition. It can be argued &quot;Socrates is a man&quot; is equivalent to &quot;All that are identical to Socrates are men&quot;, so our non-categorical syllogism can be justified by use of the equivalence above and then citing BARBARA.

==Existential import==

If a statement includes a term such that the statement is false if the term has no instances, then the statement is said to have &quot;existential import&quot; with respect to that term. It is ambiguous whether or not a universal statement of the form &quot;All A is B&quot; is to be considered as true, false, or even meaningless if there are no As. If it is considered as false in such cases, then the statement &quot;All A is B&quot; has existential import with respect to A.

It is claimed Aristotle&#x27;s logic system does not cover cases where there are no instances. Aristotle&#x27;s goal was to develop a logic for science. He relegates fictions, such as mermaids and unicorns, to the realms of poetry and literature. In his mind, they exist outside the ambit of science, which is why he leaves no room for such non-existent entities in his logic. This is a thoughtful choice, not an inadvertent omission. Technically, Aristotelian science is a search for definitions, where a definition is &quot;a phrase signifying a thing&#x27;s essence.&quot; Because non-existent entities cannot be anything, they do not, in Aristotle&#x27;s mind, possess an essence. This is why he leaves no place for fictional entities like goat-stags (or unicorns).

However, many logic systems developed since &quot;do&quot; consider the case where there may be no instances. Medieval logicians were aware of the problem of existential import and maintained that negative propositions do not carry existential import, and that positive propositions with subjects that do not supposit are false.

The following problems arise:

For example, if it is accepted that AiB is false if there are no As and AaB entails AiB, then AiB has existential import with respect to A, and so does AaB. Further, if it is accepted that AiB entails BiA, then AiB and AaB have existential import with respect to B as well. Similarly, if AoB is false if there are no As, and AeB entails AoB, and AeB entails BeA (which in turn entails BoA) then both AeB and AoB have existential import with respect to both A and B. It follows immediately that all universal categorical statements have existential import with respect to both terms. If AaB and AeB is a fair representation of the use of statements in normal natural language of All A is B and No A is B respectively, then the following example consequences arise:

:&quot;All flying horses are mythical&quot; is false if there are no flying horses.
:If &quot;No men are fire-eating rabbits&quot; is true, then &quot;There are fire-eating rabbits&quot; is true; and so on.

If it is ruled that no universal statement has existential import then the square of opposition fails in several respects (e.g. AaB does not entail AiB) and a number of syllogisms are no longer valid (e.g. BaC, AaB-&gt;AiC).

These problems and paradoxes arise in both natural language statements and statements in syllogism form because of ambiguity, in particular ambiguity with respect to All. If &quot;Fred claims all his books were Pulitzer Prize winners&quot;, is Fred claiming that he wrote any books? If not, then is what he claims true? Suppose Jane says none of her friends are poor; is that true if she has no friends?

The first-order predicate calculus avoids such ambiguity by using formulae that carry no existential import with respect to universal statements. Existential claims must be explicitly stated. Thus, natural language statements—of the forms &quot;All A is B, No A is B&quot;, &quot;Some A is B&quot;, and &quot;Some A is not B&quot;—can be represented in first order predicate calculus in which any existential import with respect to terms A and/or B is either explicit or not made at all. Consequently, the four forms &quot;AaB, AeB, AiB&quot;, and &quot;AoB&quot; can be represented in first order predicate in every combination of existential import—so it can establish which construal, if any, preserves the square of opposition and the validity of the traditionally valid syllogism. Strawson claims such a construal is possible, but the results are such that, in his view, the answer to question (e) above is &quot;no&quot;.

==Syllogistic fallacies==
People often make mistakes when reasoning syllogistically.

For instance, from the premises some A are B, some B are C, people tend to come to a definitive conclusion that therefore some A are C. However, this does not follow according to the rules of classical logic. For instance, while some cats (A) are black things (B), and some black things (B) are televisions (C), it does not follow from the parameters that some cats (A) are televisions (C). This is because in the structure of the syllogism invoked (i.e. III-1) the middle term is not distributed in either the major premise or in the minor premise, a pattern called the &quot;fallacy of the undistributed middle&quot;. Because of this, it can be hard to follow formal logic, and a closer eye is needed in order to ensure that an argument is, in fact, valid.

Determining the validity of a syllogism involves determining the distribution of each term in each statement, meaning whether all members of that term are accounted for.

In simple syllogistic patterns, the fallacies of invalid patterns are:

*Undistributed middle: Neither of the premises accounts for all members of the middle term, which consequently fails to link the major and minor term.
*Illicit treatment of the major term: The conclusion implicates all members of the major term (P – meaning the proposition is negative); however, the major premise does not account for them all (i.e., P is either an affirmative predicate or a particular subject there).
*Illicit treatment of the minor term: Same as above, but for the minor term (S – meaning the proposition is universal) and minor premise (where S is either a particular subject or an affirmative predicate).
*Exclusive premises: Both premises are negative, meaning no link is established between the major and minor terms.
*Affirmative conclusion from a negative premise: If either premise is negative, the conclusion must also be.
*Negative conclusion from affirmative premises: If both premises are affirmative, the conclusion must also be.

<text>Engrish is a slang term for the inaccurate, poorly translated, nonsensical or ungrammatical use of the English language by native speakers of other languages. The word itself relates to Japanese speakers&#x27; tendency to struggle to pronounce the English and distinctly arising from the fact Japanese has only one liquid phoneme (usually romanized &quot;r&quot;), but its definition encompasses many more errors. Terms such as &quot;Japanglish&quot;, &quot;Japlish&quot;, &quot;Jinglish&quot;, or &quot;Janglish&quot; are more specific to Japanese Engrish. The related Japanese term &quot;wasei-eigo&quot; (: &#x27;Japanese-made English&#x27;) refers to pseudo-anglicisms that have entered everyday Japanese.

The term &quot;Engrish&quot; first appears in the 1940s (suggestive of a mispronunciation of &quot;English&quot;) but it was not until the 1980s that it began to be used as a byname for defective Asian English. While the term may refer to spoken English, it often describes written English. In Japan, it is common to add English text to items for decorative and fashion purposes (see &quot;cool&quot;). Such text is often added to create a cosmopolitan feeling rather than to be read by native English speakers, and so may often be meaningless or grammatically incorrect. Engrish can be found in many places, including signs, menus, and advertisements. The words are frequently humorous to speakers of English.

==Japanese Engrish / Japanglish==
Japanese and English have significantly different grammar: Japanese word order, the frequent omission of subjects in Japanese, the absence of articles, a near-complete absence of consonant clusters, and difficulties in distinguishing /l/ and /r/, or /θ/ and /s/ sounds, all contribute to substantial problems using Standard English effectively. Japanese people have tended to score comparatively poorly on international tests of English.

Further, English is frequently used in Japan (and elsewhere) for aesthetic rather than functional purposes; i.e., for Japanese consumption, not for English speakers &quot;per se&quot;, as a way of appearing &quot;smart, sophisticated and modern&quot;, in much the same way as Japanese and similar writing scripts are used in Western fashion. Such decorative English is not meant to be read and understood by native English speakers, so emphasis is not placed on coherence or accuracy.

The Japanese language also makes extensive use of loanwords, especially from English in recent decades, and these words are transliterated into a Japanese form of pronunciation using the katakana syllabary. Japanese speakers may thus only be familiar with the Japanese pronunciation or Japanese meaning, rather than its original pronunciation or meaning. This is particularly the case when the source English word contains sounds or sound clusters which have no equivalent in katakana. 

Examples include: 
* &quot;Modan gāru&quot; vs &quot;Modern girl&quot;
* For a more recent example: Sega&#x27;s &quot;Mega Drive&quot; is spelled in katakana as , hence it is pronounced as &quot;Mega Doraibu&quot;; the console was renamed for the American market as Sega Genesis.
* The jazz fusion band Casiopea (est. 1976) has its name based on &quot;Ca&quot;ss&quot;iop&quot;eia&quot;&quot;: neither the &quot;double s&quot; nor the three-vowel &quot;-eia&quot; would fit the katakana format.

==In popular culture==
Engrish has been featured occasionally in &quot;South Park&quot;, an American animated TV show by Trey Parker and Matt Stone. One example is the song &quot;Let&#x27;s Fighting Love&quot;, used in the episode &quot;Good Times with Weapons&quot;, which parodies the poorly translated opening theme sequences sometimes shown in anime. Parker and Stone&#x27;s feature-length film &quot;Team America: World Police&quot; (2004) also features Engrish when the North Korean leader Kim Jong-il is depicted singing the song &quot;I&#x27;m so Ronery&quot;.

&quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; featured a parody of the drama series &quot;Elizabeth R&quot;, where they portrayed the cast riding motor-scooters and speaking Engrish, thus changing the title to &quot;Erizabeth L&quot;.

In the 1983 film &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;, the Parker family goes to a Chinese restaurant for their Christmas dinner, and are serenaded by the waitstaff with Engrish Christmas carols, such as &quot;Deck the harrs wis boughs of horry, fa ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra&quot; and &quot;Jingre berrs, jingre berrs, jingre arr the way, oh what fun it is to ride in one-horse open sreigh!&quot;

The British fashion brand Superdry, which takes inspiration from Japanese clothing styles, has established a style of placing meaningless Japanese text such as &#x27;Sunglasses company&#x27; and &#x27;membership certificate&#x27; on clothing sold in Britain. The company explained to a Japanese television news programme that most translations were done using simple automatic translation programs such as Babel Fish, without attempting to make the texts accurate.

<text>An autonomous robot is a robot that acts without recourse to human control. Historic examples include space probes. Modern examples include self-driving vacuums and cars.

Industrial robot arms that work on assembly lines inside factories may also be considered autonomous robots, though their autonomy is restricted due to a highly structured environment and their inability to locomote.

== Components and criteria of robotic autonomy==
=== Self-maintenance ===
The first requirement for complete physical autonomy is the ability for a robot to take care of itself. Many of the battery-powered robots on the market today can find and connect to a charging station, and some toys like Sony&#x27;s &quot;Aibo&quot; are capable of self-docking to charge their batteries.

Self-maintenance is based on &quot;proprioception&quot;, or sensing one&#x27;s own internal status. In the battery charging example, the robot can tell proprioceptively that its batteries are low, and it then seeks the charger. Another common proprioceptive sensor is for heat monitoring. Increased proprioception will be required for robots to work autonomously near people and in harsh environments. Common proprioceptive sensors include thermal, optical, and haptic sensing, as well as the Hall effect (electric).

=== Sensing the environment ===
Exteroception is sensing things about the environment. Autonomous robots must have a range of environmental sensors to perform their task and stay out of trouble. The autonomous robot can recognize sensor failures and minimize the impact on the performance caused by failures.

*Common exteroceptive sensors include the electromagnetic spectrum, sound, touch, chemical (smell, odor), temperature, range to various objects, and altitude.

Some robotic lawn mowers will adapt their programming by detecting the speed in which grass grows as needed to maintain a perfectly cut lawn, and some vacuum cleaning robots have dirt detectors that sense how much dirt is being picked up and use this information to tell them to stay in one area longer.

=== Task performance ===
The next step in autonomous behavior is to actually perform a physical task. A new area showing commercial promise is domestic robots, with a flood of small vacuuming robots beginning with iRobot and Electrolux in 2002. While the level of intelligence is not high in these systems, they navigate over wide areas and pilot in tight situations around homes using contact and non-contact sensors. Both of these robots use proprietary algorithms to increase coverage over simple random bounce.

The next level of autonomous task performance requires a robot to perform conditional tasks. For instance, security robots can be programmed to detect intruders and respond in a particular way depending upon where the intruder is. For example, Amazon launched its Astro for home monitoring, security and eldercare in September 2021.

=== Autonomous navigation ===

==== Indoor navigation ====

For a robot to associate behaviors with a place (localization) requires it to know where it is and to be able to navigate point-to-point. Such navigation began with wire-guidance in the 1970s and progressed in the early 2000s to beacon-based triangulation. Current commercial robots autonomously navigate based on sensing natural features. The first commercial robots to achieve this were Pyxus&#x27; HelpMate hospital robot and the CyberMotion guard robot, both designed by robotics pioneers in the 1980s. These robots originally used manually created CAD floor plans, sonar sensing and wall-following variations to navigate buildings. The next generation, such as MobileRobots&#x27; PatrolBot and autonomous wheelchair, both introduced in 2004, have the ability to create their own laser-based maps of a building and to navigate open areas as well as corridors. Their control system changes its path on the fly if something blocks the way.

At first, autonomous navigation was based on planar sensors, such as laser range-finders, that can only sense at one level. The most advanced systems now fuse information from various sensors for both localization (position) and navigation. Systems such as Motivity can rely on different sensors in different areas, depending upon which provides the most reliable data at the time, and can re-map a building autonomously.

Rather than climb stairs, which requires highly specialized hardware, most indoor robots navigate handicapped-accessible areas, controlling elevators, and electronic doors. With such electronic access-control interfaces, robots can now freely navigate indoors. Autonomously climbing stairs and opening doors manually are topics of research at the current time.

As these indoor techniques continue to develop, vacuuming robots will gain the ability to clean a specific user-specified room or a whole floor. Security robots will be able to cooperatively surround intruders and cut off exits. These advances also bring concomitant protections: robots&#x27; internal maps typically permit &quot;forbidden areas&quot; to be defined to prevent robots from autonomously entering certain regions.

==== Outdoor navigation ====

Outdoor autonomy is most easily achieved in the air, since obstacles are rare. Cruise missiles are rather dangerous highly autonomous robots. Pilotless drone aircraft are increasingly used for reconnaissance. Some of these unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are capable of flying their entire mission without any human interaction at all except possibly for the landing where a person intervenes using radio remote control. Some drones are capable of safe, automatic landings, however. SpaceX operates a number of autonomous spaceport drone ships, used to safely land and recover Falcon 9 rockets at sea.

Outdoor autonomy is the most difficult for ground vehicles, due to:
* Three-dimensional terrain
* Great disparities in surface density
* Weather exigencies
* Instability of the sensed environment

=== Open problems in autonomous robotics ===

There are several open problems in autonomous robotics which are special to the field rather than being a part of the general pursuit of AI. According to George A. Bekey&#x27;s &quot;Autonomous Robots: From Biological Inspiration to Implementation and Control&quot;, problems include things such as making sure the robot is able to function correctly and not run into obstacles autonomously. Reinforcement learning has been used to control and plan the navigation of autonomous robots, specifically when a group of them operate in collaboration with each other.

;Energy autonomy and foraging
Researchers concerned with creating true artificial life are concerned not only with intelligent control, but further with the capacity of the robot to find its own resources through foraging (looking for food, which includes both energy and spare parts).

This is related to autonomous foraging, a concern within the sciences of behavioral ecology, social anthropology, and human behavioral ecology; as well as robotics, artificial intelligence, and artificial life.

==Societal impact and issues==
As autonomous robots have grown in ability and technical levels, there has been increasing societal awareness and news coverage of the latest advances, and also some of the philosophical issues, economic effects, and societal impacts that arise from the roles and activities of autonomous robots.

Elon Musk, a prominent business executive and billionaire has warned for years of the possible hazards and pitfalls of autonomous robots; however, his own company is one of the most prominent companies that is trying to devise new advanced technologies in this area.

In 2021, a United Nations group of government experts, known as the &quot;Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons – Group of Governmental Experts on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems&quot;, held a conference to highlight the ethical concerns which arise from the increasingly advanced technology for autonomous robots to wield weapons and to play a military role.

==Technical development==
===Early robots===
The first autonomous robots were known as Elmer and Elsie, constructed in the late 1940s by W. Grey Walter. They were the first robots programmed to &quot;think&quot; the way biological brains do and were meant to have free will. Elmer and Elsie were often labeled as tortoises because of how they were shaped and the manner in which they moved. They were capable of phototaxis, the movement that occurs in response to light stimulus.

===Space probes===
The Mars rovers MER-A and MER-B (now known as &quot;Spirit&quot; rover and &quot;Opportunity&quot; rover) found the position of the Sun and navigated their own routes to destinations, on the fly, by:

* Mapping the surface with 3D vision
* Computing safe and unsafe areas on the surface within that field of vision
* Computing optimal paths across the safe area towards the desired destination
* Driving along the calculated route
* Repeating this cycle until either the destination is reached, or there is no known path to the destination

The planned ESA Rover, &quot;Rosalind Franklin&quot; rover, is capable of vision based relative localisation and absolute localisation to autonomously navigate safe and efficient trajectories to targets by:

* Reconstructing 3D models of the terrain surrounding the Rover using a pair of stereo cameras
* Determining safe and unsafe areas of the terrain and the general &quot;difficulty&quot; for the Rover to navigate the terrain
* Computing efficient paths across the safe area towards the desired destination
* Driving the Rover along the planned path
* Building up a navigation map of all previous navigation data

During the final NASA Sample Return Robot Centennial Challenge in 2016, a rover, named Cataglyphis, successfully demonstrated fully autonomous navigation, decision-making, and sample detection, retrieval, and return capabilities. The rover relied on a fusion of measurements from inertial sensors, wheel encoders, Lidar, and camera for navigation and mapping, instead of using GPS or magnetometers. During the 2-hour challenge, Cataglyphis traversed over 2.6 km and returned five different samples to its starting position.

===General-use autonomous robots===


The Seekur robot was the first commercially available robot to demonstrate MDARS-like capabilities for general use by airports, utility plants, corrections facilities and Homeland Security.

The DARPA Grand Challenge and DARPA Urban Challenge have encouraged development of even more autonomous capabilities for ground vehicles, while this has been the demonstrated goal for aerial robots since 1990 as part of the AUVSI International Aerial Robotics Competition.

AMR transfer carts developed by Seyiton are used to transfer loads of up to 1500 kilograms inside factories. 

Between 2013 and 2017, TotalEnergies has held the ARGOS Challenge to develop the first autonomous robot for oil and gas production sites. The robots had to face adverse outdoor conditions such as rain, wind and extreme temperatures.

Some significant current robots include: 
* Sophia is an autonomous robot that is known for its human-like appearance and behavior compared to previous robotic variants. As of 2018, Sophia&#x27;s architecture includes scripting software, a chat system, and OpenCog, an AI system designed for general reasoning. Sophia imitates human gestures and facial expressions and is able to answer certain questions and to make simple conversations on predefined topics (e.g. on the weather). The AI program analyses conversations and extracts data that allows it to improve responses in the future.
* Nine other robot humanoid &quot;siblings&quot; who were also created by Hanson Robotics. Fellow Hanson robots are Alice, Albert Einstein Hubo, BINA48, Han, Jules, Professor Einstein, Philip K. Dick Android, Zeno, and Joey Chaos. Around 2019–20, Hanson released &quot;Little Sophia&quot; as a companion that could teach children how to code, including support for Python, Blockly, and Raspberry Pi.

===Military autonomous robots===

Lethal autonomous weapons (LAWs) are a type of autonomous robot military system that can independently search for and engage targets based on programmed constraints and descriptions. LAWs are also known as lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS), autonomous weapon systems (AWS), robotic weapons, killer robots or slaughterbots. LAWs may operate in the air, on land, on water, under water, or in space. The autonomy of current systems was restricted in the sense that a human gives the final command to attack – though there are exceptions with certain &quot;defensive&quot; systems.

*UGV Interoperability Profile (UGV IOP), Robotics and Autonomous Systems – Ground IOP (RAS-G IOP), was originally a research program started by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) to organize and maintain open architecture interoperability standards for Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV). The IOP was initially created by U.S. Army Robotic Systems Joint Project Office (RS JPO):
* In October 2019, Textron and Howe &amp; Howe unveiled their Ripsaw M5 vehicle, and on 9 January 2020, the U.S. Army awarded them a contract for the Robotic Combat Vehicle-Medium (RCV-M) program. Four Ripsaw M5 prototypes are to be delivered and used in a company-level to determine the feasibility of integrating unmanned vehicles into ground combat operations in late 2021. It can reach speeds of more than , has a combat weight of 10.5 tons and a payload capacity of . The RCV-M is armed with a 30 mm autocannon and a pair of anti-tank missiles. The standard armor package can withstand 12.7×108mm rounds, with optional add-on armor increasing weight to up to 20 tons. If disabled, it will retain the ability to shoot, with its sensors and radio uplink prioritized to continue transmitting as its primary function.
* Crusher is a off-road Unmanned Ground Combat Vehicle developed by researchers at the Carnegie Mellon University&#x27;s National Robotics Engineering Center for DARPA. It is a follow-up on the previous Spinner vehicle. DARPA&#x27;s technical name for the Crusher is &quot;Unmanned Ground Combat Vehicle and Perceptor Integration System&quot;, and the whole project is known by the acronym UPI, which stands for &quot;Unmanned Ground Combat Vehicle PerceptOR Integration&quot;.
* CATS Warrior will be an autonomous wingman drone capable of take-off &amp; landing from land &amp; in sea from an aircraft carrier, it will team up with the existing fighter platforms of the IAF like Tejas, Su-30 MKI and Jaguar which will act like its mothership.
* The Warrior is primarily envisioned for the Indian Air Force use and a similar, smaller version will be designed for the Indian Navy. It would be controlled by the mothership and accomplish tasks such as scouting, absorbing enemy fire, attacking the targets if necessary with its internal &amp; external pylons weapons or sacrifice itself by crashing into the target.
* The SGR-A1 is a type of autonomous sentry gun that was jointly developed by Samsung Techwin (now Hanwha Aerospace) and Korea University to assist South Korean troops in the Korean Demilitarized Zone. It is widely considered as the first unit of its kind to have an integrated system that includes surveillance, tracking, firing, and voice recognition. While units of the SGR-A1 have been reportedly deployed, their number is unknown due to the project being &quot;highly classified&quot;.

==Types of robots==

===Humanoid===
Tesla Robot and NVIDIA GR00T are humanoid robots.

===Delivery robot===

A delivery robot is an autonomous robot used for delivering goods.

=== Charging robot ===

An automatic charging robot, unveiled on July 27, 2022, is an arm-shaped robot to charge an electric vehicle. It has been running a pilot operation at Hyundai Motor Group&#x27;s headquarters since 2021. VISION AI System based on deep learning technology has been applied. When an electric vehicle is parked in front of the charger, the robot arm recognizes the charger of the electric vehicle and derives coordinates. And automatically insert a connector into the electric car and operate fast charging. The robot arm is configured in a vertical multi-joint structure so that it can be applied to chargers at different locations for each vehicle. In addition, waterproof and dustproof functions are applied.

===Construction robots===
Construction robots are used directly on job sites and perform work such as building, material handling, earthmoving, and surveillance.

===Research and education mobile robots===
Research and education mobile robots are mainly used during a prototyping phase in the process of building full scale robots. They are a scaled down version of bigger robots with the same types of sensors, kinematics and software stack (e.g. ROS). They are often extendable and provide comfortable programming interface and development tools. Next to full scale robot prototyping they are also used for education, especially at university level, where more and more labs about programming autonomous vehicles are being introduced.

==Legislation==

In March 2016, a bill was introduced in Washington, D.C., allowing pilot ground robotic deliveries. The program was to take place from September 15 through the end of December 2017. The robots were limited to a weight of 50 pounds unloaded and a maximum speed of 10 miles per hour. In case the robot stopped moving because of malfunction the company was required to remove it from the streets within 24 hours. There were allowed only 5 robots to be tested per company at a time. A 2017 version of the Personal Delivery Device Act bill was under review as of March 2017.

In February 2017, a bill was passed in the US state of Virginia via the House bill, HB2016, and the Senate bill, SB1207, that will allow autonomous delivery robots to travel on sidewalks and use crosswalks statewide beginning on July 1, 2017. The robots will be limited to a maximum speed of 10 mph and a maximum weight of 50 pounds. In the states of Idaho and Florida there are also talks about passing the similar legislature.

It has been discussed that robots with similar characteristics to invalid carriages (e.g. 10 mph maximum, limited battery life) might be a workaround for certain classes of applications. If the robot was sufficiently intelligent and able to recharge itself using the existing electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure it would only need minimal supervision and a single arm with low dexterity might be enough to enable this function if its visual systems had enough resolution.

In November 2017, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors announced that companies would need to get a city permit in order to test these robots. In addition, the Board banned sidewalk delivery robots from making non-research deliveries.

<text>David Gauthier (; 10 September 1932 – 9 November 2023) was a Canadian philosopher best known for his neo-Hobbesian or contractarian theory of morality, as developed in his 1986 book &quot;Morals by Agreement&quot;.

==Life and career==
David Gauthier was born in Toronto on 10 September 1932. He was educated at the University of Toronto (B.A. (Hons.), 1954), Harvard University (A.M., 1955), and the University of Oxford (B.Phil., 1957; D.Phil., 1961).

Gauthier taught at the University of Toronto from 1958 until 1980, when he joined the Department of Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh, where he remained for the rest of his career.

In the 1962 Canadian federal election, Gauthier ran as a candidate for the New Democratic Party in the riding of Eglinton, in Toronto, placing third.

Gauthier also held visiting appointments at UCLA, UC Berkeley, Princeton, UC Irvine, and the University of Waterloo.

In 1979, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada (F.R.S.C.). Asteroid 15911 Davidgauthier (1997 TL21) was named in his honour.

Gauthier died on 9 November 2023, at the age of 91.

==Philosophy==
Gauthier was the author of numerous articles, some of the most important of which are collected in &quot;Moral Dealing&quot;, as well as several books including &quot;Practical Reasoning&quot;, &quot;The Logic of Leviathan&quot;, &quot;Morals by Agreement&quot;, and &quot;Rousseau: The Sentiment of Existence&quot;.

In addition to systematic work in moral theory, Gauthier was also interested in the history of political philosophy, especially Hobbes and Rousseau. He conducted work on the theory of practical rationality, where he began from an attempt to understand economic rationality, rather than from Kantian or Aristotelian antecedents.

Gauthier understood value as a matter of individuals&#x27; subjective preferences, and argued that moral constraints on straightforward utility-maximizing are prudentially justified. He argued that it is most prudent to give up straightforward maximizing and instead adopt a disposition of constrained maximization, according to which one resolves to cooperate with all similarly disposed persons (those disposed towards cooperation) and defect on the rest (straightforward maximizers), since repeated cooperation provides greater yields than repeated mutual defection from contracts (as is seen in a basic Prisoner&#x27;s dilemma game). According to Gauthier&#x27;s contractarian ethics, moral constraints are justified because they make us all better off, in terms of our preferences (whatever they may be). A consequence is that good moral thinking is just an elevated and subtly strategic version of means–end reasoning.

In &quot;Morals by Agreement&quot;, Gauthier defines translucency. An individual is translucent if their intentions can be guessed or judged by other individuals. Celeste M. Friend argues against the argument of translucency in the evolution of cooperation. First, translucency might not be realistic in human societies. This first argument was first brought by Geoffrey Sayre-McCord.  Second, translucency might be the product of social interactions: one becomes often more translucent as trust is gained, and not the other way round. Finally, excessive translucency would also reveal the underlying self-interest in being translucent, therefore hindering cooperation.

<text>Moral relativism or ethical relativism (often reformulated as relativist ethics or relativist morality) is used to describe several philosophical positions concerned with the differences in moral judgments across different peoples and cultures. An advocate of such ideas is often referred to as a relativist.

&quot;Descriptive&quot; moral relativism holds that people do, in fact, disagree fundamentally about what is moral, without passing any evaluative or normative judgments about this disagreement. &quot;Meta-ethical&quot; moral relativism holds that moral judgments contain an (implicit or explicit) indexical such that, to the extent they are truth-apt, their truth-value changes with context of use. &quot;Normative&quot; moral relativism holds that everyone &quot;ought&quot; to tolerate the behavior of others even when large disagreements about morality exist. Though often intertwined, these are distinct positions. Each can be held independently of the others.

American philosopher Richard Rorty in particular has argued that the label of being a &quot;relativist&quot; has become warped and turned into a sort of pejorative. He has written specifically that thinkers labeled as such usually simply believe &quot;that the grounds for choosing between such [philosophical] opinions is less algorithmic than had been thought&quot;, not that every single conceptual idea is as valid as any other. In this spirit, Rorty has lamented that &quot;philosophers have... become increasingly isolated from the rest of culture.&quot;

Moral relativism has been debated for thousands of years across a variety of contexts during the history of civilization. Arguments of particular notability have been made in areas such as ancient Greece and historical India while discussions have continued to the present day. Besides the material created by philosophers, the concept has additionally attracted attention in diverse fields including art, religion, and science.

==Variations==

===Descriptive===
Descriptive moral relativism is merely the positive or descriptive position that there exist, in fact, fundamental disagreements about the right course of action even when the same facts hold true and the same consequences seem likely to arise. It is the observation that different cultures have different moral standards.

Descriptive relativists do not necessarily advocate the tolerance of all behavior in light of such disagreement; that is to say, they are not necessarily normative relativists. Likewise, they do not necessarily make any commitments to the semantics, ontology, or epistemology of moral judgement; that is, not all descriptive relativists are meta-ethical relativists.

Descriptive relativism is a widespread position in academic fields such as anthropology and sociology, which simply admit that it is incorrect to assume that the same moral or ethical frameworks are always in play in all historical and cultural circumstances.

===Meta-ethical===
Meta-ethical moral relativists believe not only that people disagree about moral issues, but that terms such as &quot;good&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;, &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; do not stand subject to universal truth conditions at all; rather, they are relative to the traditions, convictions, or practices of an individual or a group of people. The American anthropologist William Graham Sumner was an influential advocate of this view. He argues in his 1906 work &quot;Folkways&quot; that what people consider right and wrong is shaped entirely—not primarily—by the traditions, customs, and practices of their culture. Moreover, since in his analysis of human understanding there cannot be any higher moral standard than that provided by the local morals of a culture, no trans-cultural judgement about the rightness or wrongness of a culture&#x27;s morals could possibly be justified.

Meta-ethical relativists are, first, descriptive relativists: they believe that, given the same set of facts, some societies or individuals will have a fundamental disagreement about what a person &quot;ought&quot; to do or prefer (based on societal or individual norms). What&#x27;s more, they argue that one cannot adjudicate these disagreements using any available independent standard of evaluation—any appeal to a relevant standard would always be merely personal or at best societal.

This view contrasts with moral universalism, which argues that, even though well-intentioned persons disagree, and some may even remain unpersuadable (e.g. someone who is closed-minded), there is still a meaningful sense in which an action could be more &quot;moral&quot; (morally preferable) than another; that is, they believe there &quot;are&quot; objective standards of evaluation that seem worth calling &quot;moral facts&quot;—regardless of whether they are universally accepted.

===Normative===
Normative moral relativists believe not only the meta-ethical thesis, but that it has normative implications on what we ought to do. Normative moral relativists argue that meta-ethical relativism implies that we &quot;ought&quot; to tolerate the behavior of others even when it runs counter to our personal or cultural moral standards. Most philosophers do not agree, partially because of the challenges of arriving at an &quot;ought&quot; from relativistic premises. Meta-ethical relativism seems to eliminate the normative relativist&#x27;s ability to make prescriptive claims. In other words, normative relativism may find it difficult to make a statement like &quot;we think it is moral to tolerate behaviour&quot; without always adding &quot;other people think &quot;intolerance&quot; of certain behaviours is moral&quot;. Some philosophers even argue that intolerance is, to some degree, important. As Russell Blackford puts it, &quot;we need not adopt a quietism about moral traditions that cause hardship and suffering. Nor need we passively accept the moral norms of our own respective societies, to the extent that they are ineffective or counterproductive or simply unnecessary&quot;. That is, it is perfectly reasonable (and practical) for a person or group to defend their subjective values against others, even if there is no universal prescription or morality. We can also criticize other cultures for failing to pursue even &quot;their own goals&quot; effectively.

The moral relativists may also still try to make sense of non-universal statements like &quot;in this country, it is wrong to do X&quot; or even &quot;to me, it is right to do Y&quot;.

Moral universalists argue further that their system often &quot;does&quot; justify tolerance, and that disagreement with moral systems does not always demand interference, and certainly not aggressive interference. For example, the utilitarian might call another society&#x27;s practice &#x27;ignorant&#x27; or &#x27;less moral&#x27;, but there would still be much debate about courses of action (e.g. whether to focus on providing better education, or technology, etc.).

==History==

Moral relativism encompasses views and arguments that people in various cultures have held over several thousand years. For example, the ancient Jaina Anekantavada principle of Mahavira (c. 599–527 BC) states that truth and reality are perceived differently from diverse points of view, and that no single point of view is the complete truth; and the Greek philosopher Protagoras (c. 481–420 BC) famously asserted that &quot;man is the measure of all things&quot;. The Greek historian Herodotus (c. 484–420 BC) observed that each society regards its own belief system and way of doing things as better than all others. Sextus Empiricus and other ancient Pyrrhonist philosophers denied the existence of objective morality.

In the early modern era Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677) notably held that nothing is inherently good or evil. The 18th-century Enlightenment philosopher David Hume (1711–1776) serves in several important respects as the father both of modern emotivism and of moral relativism, though Hume himself did not espouse relativism. He distinguished between matters of fact and matters of value, and suggested that moral judgments consist of the latter, for they do not deal with verifiable facts obtained in the world, but only with our sentiments and passions. But Hume regarded some of our sentiments as universal. He famously denied that morality has any objective standard, and suggested that the universe remains indifferent to our preferences and our troubles.

Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) believed that we have to assess the value of our values since values are relative to one&#x27;s goals and one&#x27;s self. He emphasized the need to analyze our moral values and how much impact they may have on us. The problem with morality, according to Nietzsche, is that those who were considered &quot;good&quot; were the powerful nobles who had more education, and considered themselves better than anyone below their rank. Thus, what is considered good is relative. A &quot;good man&quot; is not questioned on whether or not there is a &quot;bad&quot;, such as temptations, lingering inside him and he is considered to be more important than a man who is considered &quot;bad&quot; who is considered useless to making the human race better because of the morals we have subjected ourselves to. But since what is considered good and bad is relative, the importance and value we place on them should also be relative. He proposed that morality itself could be a danger. Nietzsche believed that morals should be constructed actively, making them relative to who we are and what we, as individuals, consider to be true, equal, good and bad, etc. instead of reacting to moral laws made by a certain group of individuals in power.

One scholar, supporting an anti-realist interpretation, concludes that &quot;Nietzsche&#x27;s central argument for anti-realism about value is explanatory: moral facts don&#x27;t figure in the &#x27;best explanation&#x27; of experience, and so are not real constituents of the objective world. Moral values, in short, can be &#x27;explained away.

It is certain that Nietzsche criticizes Plato&#x27;s prioritization of transcendence as the Forms. The Platonist view holds that what is &#x27;true&#x27;, or most real, is something which is other-worldly while the (real) world of experience is like a mere &#x27;shadow&#x27; of the Forms, most famously expressed in Plato&#x27;s allegory of the cave. Nietzsche believes that this transcendence also had a parallel growth in Christianity, which prioritized life-denying moral qualities such as humility and obedience through the church. (See &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot;, &quot;On the Genealogy of Morals&quot;, &quot;The Twilight of the Idols&quot;, &quot;The Antichrist&quot;, etc.)

Anthropologists such as Ruth Benedict (1887–1948) have cautioned observers against ethnocentricism—using the standards of their own culture to evaluate their subjects of study. Benedict said that transcendent morals do not exist—only socially constructed customs do (&quot;see&quot; cultural relativism); and that in comparing customs, the anthropologist &quot;insofar as he remains an anthropologist ... is bound to avoid any weighting of one in favor of the other&quot;. To some extent, the increasing body of knowledge of great differences in belief among societies caused both social scientists and philosophers to question whether any objective, absolute standards pertaining to values could exist. This led some to posit that differing systems have equal validity, with no standard for adjudicating among conflicting beliefs. The Finnish philosopher-anthropologist Edward Westermarck (1862–1939) ranks as one of the first to formulate a detailed theory of moral relativism. He portrayed all moral ideas as subjective judgments that reflect one&#x27;s upbringing. He rejected G.E. Moore&#x27;s (1873–1958) ethical intuitionism—in vogue during the early part of the 20th century, and which identified moral propositions as true or false, and known to us through a special faculty of intuition—because of the obvious differences in beliefs among societies, which he said provided evidence of the lack of any innate, intuitive power.

==Arguments for meta-ethical relativism==

===Scientific===

====Morality and evolution====

Research within evolutionary biology, cognitive psychology, ethology, and evolutionary anthropology has claimed that morality is a natural phenomenon that was shaped by evolutionary mechanisms. In this case, morality is defined as the set of relative social practices that promote the survival and successful reproduction of the species, or even multiple cooperating species.

===Literary===
The literary perspectivism begins at the different versions of the Greek myths. Symbolism created multiple suggestions for a verse. Structuralism teaches us the polysemy of the poems.

Examples of relativistic literary works: Gogol&#x27;s &quot;Dead Souls&quot;; &quot;The Alexandria Quartet&quot; by Lawrence Durrell; Raymond Queneau&#x27;s &quot;Zazie dans le métro&quot;.

==Criticisms of meta-ethical relativism==

===Philosophical===

====R. M. Hare====

Some philosophers, for example R. M. Hare (1919–2002), argue that moral propositions remain subject to human logical rules, notwithstanding the absence of any factual content, including those subject to cultural or religious standards or norms. Thus, for example, they contend that one cannot hold contradictory ethical judgments. This allows for moral discourse with shared standards, notwithstanding the descriptive properties or truth conditions of moral terms. They do not affirm or deny that moral facts exist, only that human logic applies to our moral assertions; consequently, they postulate an objective and preferred standard of moral justification, albeit in a very limited sense. Nevertheless, according to Hare, human logic shows the error of relativism in one very important sense (see Hare&#x27;s &quot;Sorting out Ethics&quot;). Hare and other philosophers also point out that, aside from logical constraints, all systems treat certain moral terms alike in an evaluative sense. This parallels our treatment of other terms such as &quot;less&quot; or &quot;more&quot;, which meet with universal understanding and do not depend upon independent standards (for example, one can convert measurements). It applies to good and bad when used in their non-moral sense, too; for example, when we say, &quot;this is a &quot;good&quot; wrench&quot; or &quot;this is a &quot;bad&quot; wheel&quot;. This evaluative property of certain terms also allows people of different beliefs to have meaningful discussions on moral questions, even though they may disagree about certain &quot;facts&quot;.

====Walter Terence Stace====
&quot;Ethical Relativity&quot; is the topic of the first two chapters in &quot;The Concept of Morals&quot;, in which Walter Terence Stace argues against moral absolutism, but for moral universalism.

====Philosophical poverty====
Critics propose that moral relativism fails because it rejects basic premises of discussions on morality, or because it cannot arbitrate disagreement. Many critics, including Ibn Warraq and Eddie Tabash, have suggested that meta-ethical relativists essentially take themselves out of any discussion of normative morality, since they seem to be rejecting an assumption of such discussions: the premise that there are right and wrong answers that can be discovered through reason. Practically speaking, such critics will argue that meta-ethical relativism may amount to moral nihilism, or else incoherence.

These critics argue specifically that the moral relativists reduce the extent of their input in normative moral discussions to either rejecting the very having of the discussion, or else deeming both disagreeing parties to be correct. For instance, the moral relativist can only appeal to preference to object to the practice of murder or torture by individuals for hedonistic pleasure. This accusation that relativists reject widely held terms of discourse is similar to arguments used against other &quot;discussion-stoppers&quot; like some forms of solipsism or the rejection of induction.

Philosopher Simon Blackburn made a similar criticism, and explains that moral relativism fails as a &quot;moral system&quot; simply because it cannot arbitrate disagreements.

====Other criticism====
Some arguments come when people question which moral justifications or truths are said to be relative. Because people belong to many groups based on culture, race, religion, etc., it is difficult to claim that the values of the group have authority for the members. A part of meta-ethical relativism is identifying which group of people those truths are relative to. Another component is that many people belong to more than one group. The beliefs of the groups that a person belongs to may be fundamentally different, and so it is hard to decide which are relative and which win out. A person practicing meta-ethical relativism would not necessarily object to either view, but develop an opinion and argument.

===Religious===

====Protestantism====
====Roman Catholicism====

Catholic and some secular intellectuals attribute the perceived post-war decadence of Europe to the displacement of absolute values by moral relativism. Pope Benedict XVI, Marcello Pera and others have argued that after about 1960, Europeans massively abandoned many traditional norms rooted in Christianity and replaced them with continuously evolving relative moral rules. In this view, sexual activity has become separated from procreation, which led to a decline in the importance of families and to depopulation. The most authoritative response to moral relativism from the Catholic perspective can be found in &quot;Veritatis Splendor&quot;, an encyclical by Pope John Paul II. Many of the main criticisms of moral relativism by the Catholic Church relate largely to modern controversies, such as elective abortion.

====Buddhism====
Bhikkhu Bodhi, an American Buddhist monk, has written: 

By assigning value and spiritual ideals to private subjectivity, the materialistic world view ... threatens to undermine any secure objective foundation for morality. The result is the widespread moral degeneration that we witness today. To counter this tendency, mere moral exhortation is insufficient. If morality is to function as an efficient guide to conduct, it cannot be propounded as a self-justifying scheme but must be embedded in a more comprehensive spiritual system which grounds morality in a transpersonal order. Religion must affirm, in the clearest terms, that morality and ethical values are not mere decorative frills of personal opinion, not subjective superstructure, but intrinsic laws of the cosmos built into the heart of reality.
== Views commonly confused with moral relativism ==

=== Moral relativism vs ethical subjectivism ===
Moral relativism is a distinct position from ethical subjectivism (the view that the truth of ethical claims are not mind independent). While these views are often held together, they do not entail each other. For example, someone who claims &quot;something is morally right for me to do because the people in my culture think it is right&quot; is both a moral relativist (because what is right and wrong depends on who is doing it), and an ethical subjectivist (because what is right and wrong is determined by mental states, i.e. what people think is right and wrong).

However, someone who thinks that what is right and wrong is whatever a deity thinks is right or wrong would be a subjectivist (morality is based on mental states), but not a relativist (morality is the same for everyone). In contrast, someone who claims that to act ethically you must follow the laws of your country would be a relativist (morality is dependent on who you are), but not a subjectivist (morality is based on facts about the world, not mental states).

=== Moral relativism vs moral anti-realism ===
Depending on how a moral relativist position is constructed, it may or may not be independent of moral realism. Moral realists are committed to some version of the following three claims:

# Semantic thesis: Moral statements have meaning, they express propositions, or are the kind of things that can be true or false.
# Alethic thesis: Some moral propositions are true.
# Metaphysical thesis: The metaphysical status of moral facts is robust and ordinary, not importantly different from other facts about the world.

While many moral relativists deny one or more of these claims, and therefore could be moral anti-realists, a denial is not required. A moral relativist who claims that you should act according to the laws in whatever country you are a citizen of, accepts all three claims: moral facts express propositions that can be true or false (you can see if a given action is against the law or not), some moral propositions are true (some actions abide by the laws in someone&#x27;s country), and moral facts are ordinary (laws are not mental states, they are physical objects in the world). However, this view is a relativist one as it is dependent on the country you are a citizen of.

<doc id="48055" wikidata="Q1752697" url="?curid=48055" title="Argument from nonbelief">
<text>An argument from nonbelief is a philosophical argument for the nonexistence of God that asserts an inconsistency between God&#x27;s existence and a world that fails to recognize such an entity. It is similar to the classic argument from evil in affirming an inconsistency between the world that exists and the world that would exist if God had certain desires combined with the power to see them through.

There are two key varieties of the argument. The argument from reasonable nonbelief (or the argument from divine hiddenness) was first elaborated in J. L. Schellenberg&#x27;s 1993 book &quot;Divine Hiddenness and Human Reason&quot;. This argument says that if God existed (and was perfectly good and loving) every reasonable person would have been brought to believe in God; however, there are reasonable nonbelievers; therefore, this God does not exist.

Theodore Drange subsequently developed the argument from nonbelief, based on the mere existence of nonbelief in God. Drange considers the distinction between reasonable (by which Schellenberg means inculpable) and unreasonable (culpable) nonbelief to be irrelevant and confusing. Nevertheless, the overwhelming majority of academic discussion is concerned with Schellenberg&#x27;s formulation.

==Historical references to the problem of divine hiddenness==
The theme of divine hiddenness, silence or darkness has a long history in Judeo-Christian and Islamic theology. The roots of the Judeo-Christian description of God as hidden are in the Bible, for example in the Psalms, &quot;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?...I cry by day, but you do not answer...&quot;, and in Isaiah: &quot;Truly you are a God who hides himself, O God of Israel, the Savior.&quot;

One of the first philosophers to write on the theme of divine hiddenness was Anselm of Canterbury, who in his &quot;Proslogion&quot; links it to an existential or spiritual concern:
Daniel Howard-Snyder and Paul Moser, in the introduction to a volume of papers on the idea of divine hiddenness as evidence against theism, cite Nietzsche&#x27;s question as anticipating this contemporary theme: &quot;a god who is all-knowing and all-powerful and who does not even make sure his creatures understand his intentions—could that be a god of goodness?&quot;

==Schellenberg&#x27;s hiddenness argument==

Discussion of Schellenberg&#x27;s argument has made explicit a non-theological use of the term &#x27;hiddenness&#x27;, which is now commonly used simply as a way of talking about the subjective condition of nonbelief in God. In his first presentation of the argument Schellenberg emphasized inculpable or reasonable nonbelief, but he has since shifted to speaking more specifically about nonresistant nonbelief. The first presentation is often given by commentators as follows, based on Schellenberg&#x27;s own summing up:
Schellenberg has stated that this formulation is misleading, when taken on its own, because it does not make explicit the reason why a perfectly loving God would want to prevent nonbelief. His deepest claim, he says, is &quot;about the connection between love and openness to relationship—a personal and positively meaningful and explicit sort of relationship of the sort that logically presupposes each party&#x27;s belief in the other&#x27;s existence.&quot; A later presentation of the argument by Schellenberg, which aims at accessibility for students, includes this element:
In an article revisiting the argument ten years after it was originally proposed, Schellenberg observes that criticism has mainly centered around the idea that God would prevent inculpable nonbelief. He asserts that there are relatively few criticisms questioning the existence of inculpable nonbelief, and almost no theistic philosopher objects to the idea that God is perfectly loving.

=== God is perfectly loving ===
Schellenberg says he has not seen any serious objections to this premise by theistic philosophers, but there certainly are other conceptions of God. Daniel Howard-Snyder writes about the possibility of believing in an unsurpassably great personal god that is nevertheless dispassionate towards its creatures. Drawing on the Stoic concept of Eudaimonia, he says one can think of a god more akin to a wise sage than the loving parent that Schellenberg envisions.

Theodore Drange, in his attempt to improve the argument (see below), states that there are many theists who do not view God as perfectly loving, and &quot;some Christians think of him as an angry deity bent on punishing people for their sins.&quot; Drange concludes that the argument should be put forward only in relation to theists who already accept the first premise and believe in a god who is perfectly loving.

Most theists, in fact, do admit that love is a central concept in almost all of the world&#x27;s religions. God is often directly associated with love, especially with agape. Theologians such as N.T. Wright suggest that our experience of love is itself a proof of God&#x27;s existence. However, there are a few others (e.g. Brian Davies in the Thomist tradition) who suggest that the modern interpretation of what it means to say God loves human beings is incorrect, and so that God is able to be loving in a sense while actually willing disbelief.

=== Nonresistant nonbelief, lack of evidence, and sin ===

When asked what he would say when facing God on judgment day, Bertrand Russell famously replied that he would say &quot;Not enough evidence, God! Not enough evidence!&quot; Some nonbelievers may have hidden from themselves what seems to them to be possible evidence of the divine, but the view of the hiddenness argument is that others have tried hard to believe in God. Schellenberg addresses this difference with his distinction between culpable and &quot;inculpable&quot; nonbelief, with the latter defined as &quot;non-belief that exists through no fault of the non-believer.&quot;

Historically, the Calvinist tradition has placed the blame on nonbelievers, who are predestined by God towards nonbelief. Calvin&#x27;s religious epistemology is based on the &quot;sensus divinitatis&quot; (Sense of Divinity), the view that the presence of God is universally perceived by all humans. Paul Helm explains, &quot;Calvin’s use of the term &#x27;sense&#x27; signals that the knowledge of God is a common human endowment; mankind is created not only as capable of knowing God, but as actually knowing him.&quot; According to this tradition, there is no inculpable or nonresistant nonbelief. Jonathan Edwards, the 18th century American theologian, claimed that while every human being has been granted the capacity to know God, successful use of these capacities requires an attitude of &quot;true benevolence&quot;, a divinely gifted willingness to be open to the truth about God. Thus, the failure of non-believers to see &quot;divine things&quot; is in his view due to &quot;a dreadful stupidity of mind, occasioning a sottish insensibility of their truth and importance.&quot;

=== Demographics of theism and the problem of natural nonbelief ===
In modern times, there are fewer proponents of these views. One reason is that, as Stephen Maitzen argues, anthropology has long established that while religious belief in general is essentially universal, belief in what Calvin would recognize as God is very unevenly distributed among cultures (consider for example God in Buddhism, Jain cosmology, or non-theistic animism). If God exists, then why, Maitzen asks, does the prevalence of belief in God vary so dramatically with cultural and national boundaries? Jason Marsh has extended this kind of demographic challenge by focusing on human evolution and cognitive science of religion. Why is theistic belief apparently non-existent among early humans but common at later times, at least in some regions? According to Marsh, the hiddenness problem is harder to answer once we appreciate that much nonbelief is &#x27;natural&#x27;, owing to the kinds of minds people naturally possess and to their place in evolutionary and cultural history.

Another reason why many philosophers no longer attribute nonbelief to human sinfulness has to do with respect. In fact, modern critics, such as Howard-Snyder, who praised Schellenberg&#x27;s book for being &quot;religiously sensitive,&quot; are similarly sensitive towards the nonbeliever. Howard-Snyder wrote:
=== Would a perfectly loving God prevent nonresistant nonbelief? ===
The most serious criticisms of the hiddenness argument have been leveled against the idea that a perfectly loving God would prevent nonresistant nonbelief. Schellenberg argues in two steps, by first claiming that a loving God would enable humans to partake in a relationship with it, and then, assuming that belief in that god is a necessary condition for such relationships to occur, inferring that a loving God would not permit nonbelief. He states:

He justifies this claim by arguing that a conception of divine love can best be formed by extrapolating the best aspects of love in human relations, and draws an analogy with perfect parental love:

But, says Schellenberg, belief in God&#x27;s existence is necessary for engaging in such a meaningful relationship with God. He therefore concludes that if there is a perfectly loving God, such creatures will always believe in it. He further argues that since belief is involuntary, these creatures should always have evidence &quot;causally sufficient&quot; for such belief:

==Objections and counterarguments==

=== Skeptical theism ===
Skeptical theism is the view that we should remain skeptical of claims that our perceptions about God&#x27;s purposes can reasonably be considered good evidence of what they are. The central thesis of skeptical theism is that it would not be surprising for an infinitely intelligent and knowledgeable being&#x27;s reasons for permitting a perception of evil or alleged hiddenness to be beyond human comprehension.[2] That is, what is perceived as hiddenness may be necessary for a greater good or to prevent equal or even greater evils.

Schellenberg has responded to skeptical theism (i.e. noseeum/unknown-purpose defense). First, Schellenberg says that he has given known reasons to think that a perfectly loving being would always be open to a personal relationship; ipso facto, God would not sacrifice some time in the relationship for the sake of unknown greater goods, and if the greatest good for finite creatures is to be in a relationship with God, then God would not sacrifice that for the sake of unknown greater goods. Finally, Schellenberg&#x27;s position is that all known and unknown goods are ultimately in God; hence, God can bring about unknown greater goods without hiddenness.

==== Noseeum defense ====
The philosophers Michael Bergmann and Michael Rea described the philosopher William Rowe&#x27;s justification for the second premise of the argument from evil, which is equally applicable to a perception of hiddenness:Some evidential arguments ... rely on a “noseeum” inference of the following sort: NI: If, after thinking hard, we can’t think of any God-justifying reason for permitting some horrific evil then it is likely that there is no such reason. (The reason NI is called a ‘noseeum’ inference is that it says, more or less, that because we don’t see ‘um, they probably ain’t there.)Various analogies are offered to show that the noseeum inference is logically unsound. For example, a novice chess player&#x27;s inability to discern a chess master&#x27;s choice of moves cannot be used to infer that there is no good reason for the move. The skeptical theist and noseeum defense place the burden of proof on the atheist to prove that their intuitions about God are trustworthy.

=== Unreasonable demands on God ===
This argument is sometimes seen as demanding God to prove his existence, for example by performing miracles. Critics have argued that even in Schellenberg&#x27;s more refined version, the nonbeliever is imposing their own epistemological expectations on the will of God. A detailed discussion of these kinds of demands, and their moral and spiritual implications, is provided by Paul Moser, who says that such demands amount to cognitive idolatry. He defines idolatry as &quot;our not letting the true God be Lord in our lives&quot; and instead committing to something other than God by pursuing a quest for self-realization in our own terms. If this is idolatry in our actions, then idolatry in our knowing, he says, is as follows:
Schellenberg considers this criticism irrelevant to the argument, which in his opinion, does not impose any demands for demonstrations of God&#x27;s power, but rather looks for evidence that &quot;need only be such as will be causally sufficient for belief in the absence of resistance... This result might be effected through the much more spiritually appropriate means of religious experience, interpreted in the sensitive manner of a Pascal or a Kierkegaard.&quot; Schellenberg then expresses a certain frustration that theistic writers who otherwise extol the value of religious experiences deny non-theists the right to do so.

=== Soul-making theodicy ===

John Hick used the term &quot;soul-making&quot; in his theodicy &quot;Evil and the God of Love&quot; to describe the kind of spiritual development that he believes justifies the existence of evil. This defense is employed by Michael Murray, who explains how, in his view, divine hiddenness is essential to soul-making. It may seem that it is not hard to imagine a world where God is known and yet believers act freely with ample opportunities for spiritual development. But Murray gives a deep and careful analysis of the argument, concluding that if God&#x27;s existence were revealed in such a way as to remove reasonable non-belief, then &quot;any desire that we might have to believe or act in ways contrary to that which has been revealed would be overwhelmed.&quot;

Critics note here that, for example, in Christianity (and even more in Judaism, where God is represented as talking to Job and explaining why he is just), God is already believed to have exposed himself very distinctly: for example to the Apostles who saw his resurrection. One theistic explanation of this might be that God knows some people would not believe anyway but if God knows this before creating, there is a problem about God&#x27;s liability for what is created. More fundamentally in relation to Murray&#x27;s argument, there is the problem for orthodox believers of explaining the existence of Satan, a fallen angel who is obviously aware of God and yet, according to theistic scriptures, freely chose to rebel against God.

=== Turning the tables ===
Like with the argument from evil, one can &quot;flip&quot; the argument from divine hiddenness. In other words, one can argue that the fact that many or most people believe that God exists (and/or have experiences of God) is evidence that God &quot;does&quot; exist.

=== Unknown purpose defense ===
Alvin Plantinga writes that the statement &quot;We can see no good reason for God to do X&quot; only implies &quot;There is no good reason for God to do X&quot; on the assumption that &quot;If there were a good reason for God to do X, we would be able to see it,&quot; which he suggests is absurd. This point might be applied to versions of the argument from nonbelief that suggest without support that there is no good reason for God to permit nonbelief. Critics of Plantinga might suggest that if nobody is able to present an apparently good reason for God to allow nonbelief, then it is less ad hoc to merely posit God&#x27;s non-existence, or indifference to people&#x27;s belief, to explain this inability, than to posit both the existence of a God who cares about people&#x27;s beliefs as well as some unthinkable reason obvious only to God to remain hidden.

=== There really are no atheists defense ===
This argument posits that all true atheists are, at their core, lying in order to live in a way that contradicts God&#x27;s commands, as seen in certain interpretations of Romans 1:18-25. Critics point out that there are atheists who are genuinely not lying and are not using their atheism as an excuse to sin. However, proponents argue that atheists could still be deceiving themselves, even if they are not lying to others (for example, the argument about loving the wrong woman, which may need further clarification). Some have suggested that this argument overlooks Stephen Maitzen&#x27;s point regarding the demographics of theism: if all atheists are liars, why are people in some societies more likely to lie than in others? Additionally, others contend that the argument fails to address Jason Marsh&#x27;s point about natural nonbelief in early humans. Since it is plausible that natural nonbelief existed in early humans, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to claim that such nonbelief is self-deceptive. Natural nonbelief, they argue, entails nonresistant nonbelief.

==Drange&#x27;s argument from nonbelief==
Theodore Drange proposed a version of the nonbelief argument in 1996. He considers the distinction between culpable and inculpable nonbelief to be unhelpful in the argument, arguing instead that the mere existence of nonbelief is evidence against the existence of God. A semi-formal presentation of the argument is as follows:
#If God exists, God:
## wants all humans to believe God exists before they die;
## can bring about a situation in which all humans believe God exists before they die;
## does not want anything that would conflict with and be at least as important as its desire for all humans to believe God exists before they die; and
## always acts in accordance with what it most wants.
# If God exists, all humans would believe so before they die (from 1).
# But not all humans believe God exists before they die.
# Therefore, God does not exist (from 2 and 3).

Drange&#x27;s argument is directed primarily to Christians, and the philosopher Laura Garcia has replied from that perspective. She says that Drange&#x27;s argument hinges on the idea that belief in God&#x27;s existence is, according to Christians, necessary for salvation. According to Garcia this idea is mistaken: &quot;many Christians deny this claim and the Catholic Church explicitly rejects it.&quot; But as Garcia notes, Drange has answered that for many Christians—in particular, evangelical Christians—his point should remain convincing, and that there are in any case other good things that belief in God can bring for humans, which a good God would desire, such as peace of mind and a sense of meaning in life.

<doc id="48063" wikidata="Q2633" url="?curid=48063" title="Fibonacci coding">
<text>In mathematics and computing, Fibonacci coding is a universal code which encodes positive integers into binary code words. It is one example of representations of integers based on Fibonacci numbers. Each code word ends with &quot;11&quot; and contains no other instances of &quot;11&quot; before the end.

The Fibonacci code is closely related to the Zeckendorf representation, a positional numeral system that uses Zeckendorf&#x27;s theorem and has the property that no number has a representation with consecutive 1s. The Fibonacci code word for a particular integer is exactly the integer&#x27;s Zeckendorf representation with the order of its digits reversed and an additional &quot;1&quot; appended to the end.

==Definition==
For a number formula_1, if formula_2 represent the digits of the code word representing formula_1 then we have:

: formula_4

where is the th Fibonacci number, and so is the th distinct Fibonacci number starting with formula_5. The last bit formula_6 is always an appended bit of 1 and does not carry place value.

It can be shown that such a coding is unique, and the only occurrence of &quot;11&quot; in any code word is at the end (that is, &quot;d&quot;(&quot;k&quot;−1) and &quot;d&quot;(&quot;k&quot;)). The penultimate bit is the most significant bit and the first bit is the least significant bit. Also, leading zeros cannot be omitted as they can be in, for example, decimal numbers.

The first few Fibonacci codes are shown below, and also their so-called &quot;implied probability&quot;, the value for each number that has a minimum-size code in Fibonacci coding.

To encode an integer :
# Find the largest Fibonacci number equal to or less than &#x27;; subtract this number from &#x27;, keeping track of the remainder.
# If the number subtracted was the th Fibonacci number , put a 1 in place in the code word (counting the left most digit as place 0).
# Repeat the previous steps, substituting the remainder for &quot;&quot;, until a remainder of 0 is reached.
# Place an additional 1 after the rightmost digit in the code word.

To decode a code word, remove the final &quot;1&quot;, assign the remaining the values 1,2,3,5,8,13... (the Fibonacci numbers) to the bits in the code word, and sum the values of the &quot;1&quot; bits.

==Comparison with other universal codes==

Fibonacci coding has a useful property that sometimes makes it attractive in comparison to other universal codes: it is an example of a self-synchronizing code, making it easier to recover data from a damaged stream. With most other universal codes, if a single bit is altered, then none of the data that comes after it will be correctly read. With Fibonacci coding, on the other hand, a changed bit may cause one token to be read as two, or cause two tokens to be read incorrectly as one, but reading a &quot;0&quot; from the stream will stop the errors from propagating further. Since the only stream that has no &quot;0&quot; in it is a stream of &quot;11&quot; tokens, the total edit distance between a stream damaged by a single bit error and the original stream is at most three.

This approach, encoding using sequence of symbols, in which some patterns (like &quot;11&quot;) are forbidden, can be freely generalized.

==Example==
The following table shows that the number 65 is represented in Fibonacci coding as 0100100011, since . The first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1) are not used, and an additional 1 is always appended.

:formula_7

==Generalizations==
The Fibonacci encodings for the positive integers are binary strings that end with &quot;11&quot; and contain no other instances of &quot;11&quot;. This can be generalized to binary strings that end with &quot;N&quot; consecutive 1s and contain no other instances of &quot;N&quot; consecutive 1s. For instance, for &quot;N&quot; = 3 the positive integers are encoded as 111, 0111, 00111, 10111, 000111, 100111, 010111, 110111, 0000111, 1000111, 0100111, …. In this case, the number of encodings as a function of string length is given by the sequence of tribonacci numbers.

For general constraints defining which symbols are allowed after a given symbol, the maximal information rate can be obtained by first finding the optimal transition probabilities using a maximal entropy random walk, then using an entropy coder (with switched encoder and decoder) to encode a message as a sequence of symbols fulfilling the found optimal transition probabilities.

<text>Sesame Street is an American educational children&#x27;s television series that combines live-action, sketch comedy, animation, and puppetry. It is produced by Sesame Workshop (known as the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop until June 2000) and was created by Joan Ganz Cooney and Lloyd Morrisett. It is known for its images communicated through the use of Jim Henson&#x27;s Muppets, and includes short films, with humor and cultural references. It premiered on November 10, 1969, to positive reviews, some controversy, and high viewership. It has aired on the United States national public television provider PBS since its debut, with its first run moving to premium channel HBO on January 16, 2016, then its sister streaming service HBO Max in 2020.

The show&#x27;s format consists of a combination of commercial television production elements and techniques which have evolved to reflect changes in American culture and audiences&#x27; viewing habits. It was the first children&#x27;s TV show to use educational goals and a curriculum to shape its content, and the first show whose educational effects were formally studied. Its format and content have undergone significant changes to reflect changes to its curriculum.

Shortly after its creation, its producers developed what came to be called the CTW Model (after the production company&#x27;s previous name), a system of planning, production and evaluation based on collaboration between producers, writers, educators and researchers. The show was initially funded by government and private foundations, but has become somewhat self-supporting due to revenues from licensing arrangements, international sales and other media. By 2006, independently produced versions (&quot;co-productions&quot;) of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; were broadcast in 20 countries. In 2001, there were over 120 million viewers of various international versions of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;; and by its 40th anniversary in 2009, it was broadcast in more than 140 countries.

Since its debut, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; has garnered praise. It was by then the 15th-highest-rated children&#x27;s television show in the United States. A 1996 survey found that 95% of all American preschoolers had watched it by the time they were three. In 2018, it was estimated that 86 million Americans had watched it as children. As of 2022, it has won 222 Emmy Awards and 11 Grammy Awards, more than any other children&#x27;s show. &quot;Sesame Street&quot; remains one of the longest-running shows in the world.

==History==

&quot;Sesame Street&quot; was conceived in 1966 during discussions between television producer Joan Ganz Cooney and Carnegie Foundation vice president Lloyd Morrisett. Their goal was to create a children&#x27;s television show that would &quot;master the addictive qualities of television and do something good with them,&quot; such as helping young children prepare for school. After two years of research, the newly formed Children&#x27;s Television Workshop (CTW) received a combined grant of US$8million ($ million in dollars) from the Carnegie Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the U.S. federal government to create and produce a new children&#x27;s television show.

&quot;Sesame Street&quot; was officially announced at a press conference on May 6, 1969. Joan Ganz Cooney, Children&#x27;s Television Workshop&#x27;s executive director, said that &quot;Sesame Street&quot; would use the techniques of commercial television programs to teach young children. Live shorts and animated cartoons would teach young children the alphabet, numbers, vocabulary, shapes, and basic reasoning skills. By repeating concepts throughout an episode, young children&#x27;s interest would be held while they learn the concepts. Guest cameos would help attract older children and adults. Cooney said that the name &quot;Sesame Street&quot; came from the saying &quot;open sesame&quot;, which gives the idea of a place where exciting things occur. The show was given an initial six-month run in order to determine whether it was effective and would continue to air.

The program premiered on public television stations on November 10, 1969. It was the first preschool educational television program to base its contents and production values on laboratory and formative research. Initial responses to the show included adulatory reviews, some controversy, and high ratings.

According to writer Michael Davis, by the mid-1970s the show had become &quot;an American institution.&quot; The cast and crew expanded during this time, with emphasis on the hiring of women crew members and the addition of minorities to the cast. The show&#x27;s success continued into the 1980s. In 1981, when the federal government withdrew its funding, CTW turned to and expanded other revenue sources, including its magazine division, book royalties, product licensing, and foreign broadcast income. Its curriculum has expanded to include more affective topics such as relationships, ethics and emotions. Many of its storylines have been inspired by the experiences of its writing staff, cast and crew—most notably, the 1982 death of Will Lee, who played Mr. Hooper; and the marriage of Luis and Maria in 1988.

By the end of the 1990s, the show faced societal and economic challenges, including changes in young children&#x27;s viewing habits, competition from other shows, the development of cable television, and a drop in ratings. As the 21st century began, the show made major changes. Starting in 2002, its format became more narrative-focused and included ongoing storylines. After its 30th anniversary in 1999, due to the popularity of the Muppet Elmo, the show also incorporated a popular segment known as &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot;. In 2009, the show won the Outstanding Achievement Emmy for its 40 years on the air.

In late 2015, in response to &quot;sweeping changes in the media business&quot; and as part of a five-year programming and development deal, premium television service HBO began airing first-run episodes of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. The episodes became available on PBS stations and websites nine months after they aired on HBO. The deal allowed Sesame Workshop to produce more episodes—increasing from 18 to 35 per season—and to create a spinoff series with the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; Muppets, and a new educational series.

At its 50th anniversary in 2019, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; had produced over 4,500 episodes, two feature-length movies (&quot;Follow That Bird&quot; in 1985 and &quot;The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland&quot; in 1999), 35 TV specials, 200 home videos, and 180 albums. Its YouTube channel has over 24 million subscribers. It was announced in October 2019 that first-run episodes will move to HBO Max beginning with the show&#x27;s 51st season in 2020. On December 13, 2024, it was announced that Max would not be renewing their contract to make episodes of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, meaning 2025 will be the last year for episodes made with Max. Episodes will be in the Max streaming library until 2027. A spokesperson for Sesame Workshop stated: &quot;We will continue to invest in our best-in-class programming and look forward to announcing our new distribution plans in the coming months, ensuring that &#x27;Sesame Street&#x27; reaches as many children as possible for generations to come.&quot;

==Format==

From its first episode, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s format has utilized &quot;a strong visual style, fast-moving action, humor, and music,&quot; as well as animation and live-action short films. When it premiered, most researchers believed that young children did not have long attention spans, and the show&#x27;s producers were concerned that an hour-long show would not hold their attention. At first, its &quot;street scenes&quot;—the action recorded on its set—consisted of character-driven interactions. Rather than ongoing stories, they were written as individual, curriculum-based segments interrupted by &quot;inserts&quot; of puppet sketches, short films and animations. This structure allowed producers to use a mixture of styles and characters, and to vary its pace, presumably keeping it interesting to young viewers. However, by season 20, research showed that children were able to follow a story—and the street scenes, while still interspersed with other segments, became evolving storylines.

On recommendations by child psychologists, the producers initially decided that the show&#x27;s human actors and Muppets would not interact because they were concerned it would confuse young children. When CTW tested the new show, they found that children paid attention during the Muppet segments, and that their interest was lost during the &quot;Street&quot; segments. They requested that Henson and his team create Muppets such as Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch to interact with the human actors, and the Street segments were re-shot.

&quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s format remained intact until the 2000s, when the changing audience required that producers move to a more narrative format. In 1998, the popular &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World,&quot; a 15-minute-long segment hosted by the Muppet Elmo, was created. Starting in 2014, during the show&#x27;s 45th season, the producers introduced a half-hour version of the program. The new version, which originally complemented the full-hour series, was broadcast weekday afternoons and streamed on the Internet. In 2017, in response to the changing viewing habits of toddlers, the show&#x27;s producers decreased the show&#x27;s length from one hour to 30 minutes across all its broadcast platforms. The new version focused on fewer characters, reduced pop culture references &quot;once included as winks for their parents&quot;, and focused &quot;on a single backbone topic.&quot;

The format will be changed yet again in Season 56, as it was announced on October 30, 2023 by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; that &quot;Sesame Street&quot; will be reimagined by completely dropping the half-hour magazine-style format of the long-running children&#x27;s show in favor of a longer narrative-driven style and more live action Muppet puppet characters. The reimagined format will feature two 11-minute story segments, paired with a new animated series, &quot;Tales from 123&quot;.

==Educational goals==
Author Malcolm Gladwell said that &quot;&quot;Sesame Street&quot; was built around a single, breakthrough insight: that if you can hold the attention of children, you can educate them.&quot; Gerald S. Lesser, the CTW&#x27;s first advisory board chair, went even further, saying that the effective use of television as an educational tool needed to capture, focus, and sustain children&#x27;s attention. &quot;Sesame Street&quot; was the first children&#x27;s show to structure each episode, and the segments within them, to capture children&#x27;s attention, and to make, as Gladwell put it, &quot;small but critical adjustments&quot; to keep it. According to CTW researchers Rosemarie Truglio and Shalom Fisch, it was one of the few children&#x27;s shows to utilize a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum, garnered from formative and summative research.

&quot;Sesame Street&quot;&#x27;s creators and researchers formulated both cognitive and affective goals for the show. They initially focused on cognitive goals, while addressing affective goals indirectly, believing it would increase children&#x27;s self-esteem and feelings of competency. One of their primary goals was preparing young children for school, especially children from low-income families, using modeling, repetition, and humor. They adjusted its content to increase viewers&#x27; attention and the show&#x27;s appeal, and encouraged older children and parents to &quot;co-view&quot; it by including more sophisticated humor, cultural references, and celebrity guests; by 2019, 80% of parents watched &quot;Sesame Street&quot; with their children, and 650 celebrities had appeared on the show.


During &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s first season, some critics felt that it should address more overtly such affective goals as social competence, tolerance of diversity, and nonaggressive ways of resolving conflict. The show&#x27;s creators and producers responded by featuring these themes in interpersonal disputes between its Street characters. During the 1980s, the show incorporated real-life experiences of its cast and crew, including the death of Will Lee (Mr. Hooper) and the pregnancy of Sonia Manzano (Maria). In later seasons, it addressed real-life disasters such as the September 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina.

In its first season, the show addressed its outreach goals by focusing on the promotion of educational materials used in preschool settings; and in subsequent seasons, by focusing on their development. Innovative programs were developed because their target audience, children and their families in low-income, inner-city homes, did not traditionally watch educational programs on television and because traditional methods of promotion and advertising were not effective with these groups.

Starting in 2006, the Workshop expanded its outreach by creating a series of PBS specials and DVDs focusing on how military deployment affects the families of servicepeople. Its outreach efforts also focused on families of prisoners, health and wellness, and safety. In 2013, SW started Sesame Street in Communities, to help families dealing with difficult issues.

==Funding==
As a result of Cooney&#x27;s initial proposal in 1968, the Carnegie Institute awarded her a $1 million grant to create a new children&#x27;s television program and establish the CTW, renamed in June 2000 to Sesame Workshop (SW). Cooney and Morrisett procured additional multimillion-dollar grants from the U.S. federal government, The Arthur Vining Davis Foundations, CPB, and the Ford Foundation. Davis reported that Cooney and Morrisett decided that if they did not procure full funding from the beginning, they would drop the idea of producing the show. As Lesser reported, funds gained from a combination of government agencies and private foundations protected them from the economic pressures experienced by commercial broadcast television networks, but created challenges in procuring future funding.

After &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s initial success, its producers began to think about its survival beyond its development and first season and decided to explore other funding sources. From the first season, they understood that the source of their funding, which they considered &quot;seed&quot; money, would need to be replaced. The 1970s were marked by conflicts between the CTW and the federal government; in 1978, the U.S. Department of Education refused to deliver a $2 million check (equivalent to $ million in ) until the last day of CTW&#x27;s fiscal year. As a result, the CTW decided to depend upon licensing arrangements with toy companies and other manufacturers, publishing, and international sales for their funding.

In 1998, the CTW accepted corporate sponsorship to raise funds for &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and other projects. For the first time, they allowed short advertisements by indoor playground manufacturer Discovery Zone, their first corporate sponsor, to air before and after each episode. Consumer advocate Ralph Nader, who had previously appeared on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, called for a boycott of the show, saying that the CTW was &quot;exploiting impressionable children.&quot; In 2015, in response to funding challenges, it was announced that premium television service HBO would air first-run episodes of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Steve Youngwood, SW&#x27;s Chief Operating Officer, called the move &quot;one of the toughest decisions we ever made.&quot; According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the move &quot;drew an immediate backlash.&quot; Critics claimed that it favored privileged children over less-advantaged children and their families, the original focus of the show. They also criticized choosing to air first-run episodes on HBO, a network with adult dramas and comedies.

==Production==

===Research===
Producer Joan Ganz Cooney has stated, &quot;Without research, there would be no &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.&quot; In 1967, when she and her team began planning the show&#x27;s development, combining research with television production was, as she put it, &quot;positively heretical.&quot; Its producers soon began developing what came to be called the CTW Model, a system of planning, production and evaluation that did not fully emerge until the end of the show&#x27;s first season. According to Morrow, the Model consisted of four parts: &quot;the interaction of receptive television producers and child science experts, the creation of a specific and age-appropriate curriculum, research to shape the program directly, and independent measurement of viewers&#x27; learning.&quot;

Cooney credited the show&#x27;s high standard in research procedures to Harvard professors Gerald S. Lesser, whom CTW hired to design its educational objectives; and Edward L. Palmer, who conducted the show&#x27;s formative research and bridged the gap between producers and researchers. CTW conducted research in two ways: in-house formative research that informed and improved production; and independent summative evaluations, conducted by the Educational Testing Service (ETS) during the first two seasons, which measured its educational effectiveness. Cooney said, &quot;From the beginning, we—the planners of the project—designed the show as an experimental research project with educational advisers, researchers, and television producers collaborating as equal partners.&quot; She characterized the collaboration as an &quot;arranged marriage.&quot;

===Writing===
&quot;Sesame Street&quot; has used many writers in its long history. As Peter Hellman wrote in his 1987 article in &quot;New York Magazine&quot;, &quot;The show, of course, depends upon its writers, and it isn&#x27;t easy to find adults who could identify the interest level of a pre-schooler.&quot; Fifteen writers a year worked on the show&#x27;s scripts, but very few lasted longer than one season. Norman Stiles, head writer in 1987, reported that most writers would &quot;burn out&quot; after writing about a dozen scripts. According to Gikow, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; went against the convention of hiring teachers to write for the show, as most educational television programs did at the time. Instead, Cooney and the producers felt that it would be easier to teach writers how to interpret curriculum than to teach educators how to write comedy. As Stone stated, &quot;Writing for children is not so easy.&quot; Long-time writer Tony Geiss agreed, stating in 2009, &quot;It&#x27;s not an easy show to write. You have to know the characters and the format and how to teach and be funny at the same time, which is a big, ambidextrous stunt.&quot;

The show&#x27;s research team developed an annotated document, or &quot;Writer&#x27;s Notebook,&quot; which served as a bridge between the show&#x27;s curriculum goals and script development. The notebook was a compilation of programming ideas designed to teach specific curriculum points, provided extended definitions of curriculum goals, and assisted the writers and producers in translating the goals into televised material. Suggestions in the notebook were free of references to specific characters and contexts on the show so that they could be implemented as openly and flexibly as possible.

The research team, in a series of meetings with the writers, also developed &quot;a curriculum sheet&quot; that described the show&#x27;s goals and priorities for each season. After receiving the curriculum focus and goals for the season, the writers met to discuss ideas and story arcs for the characters, and an &quot;assignment sheet&quot; was created that suggested how much time was allotted for each goal and topic. When a script was completed, the show&#x27;s research team analyzed it to ensure that the goals were met. Then each production department met to determine what each episode needed in terms of costumes, lights, and sets. The writers were present during the show&#x27;s taping, which for the first twenty-four years of the show took place in Manhattan, and after 1992, at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens to make last-minute revisions when necessary.

===Media===
Early in their history &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and the CTW began to look for alternative funding sources and turned to creating products and writing licensing agreements. They became, as Cooney put it, &quot;a multiple-media institution.&quot; In 1970, the CTW created a &quot;non-broadcast&quot; division responsible for creating and publishing books and &quot;Sesame Street Magazine&quot;. By 2019, the Sesame Workshop had published over 6,500 book titles. The Workshop decided from the start that all materials their licensing program created would &quot;underscore and amplify&quot; the show&#x27;s curriculum. In 2004, over 68% of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s revenue came from licenses and products such as toys and clothing. By 2008, the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; Muppets accounted for between $15 million and $17 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees, split between the Sesame Workshop and The Jim Henson Company. By 2019, the Sesame Workshop had over 500 licensing agreements and had produced over 200 hours of home video. There have been two theatrically released &quot;Sesame Street&quot; movies, &quot;Follow That Bird&quot;, released in 1985, and &quot;Elmo in Grouchland&quot;, released in 1999. In early 2019, it was announced that a third film, a musical co-starring Anne Hathaway and written and directed by Jonathan Krisel, would be produced. In November 2019, Sesame Street announced a family friendly augmented reality application produced by Weyo in partnership with Sesame Workshop in honor of the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

Jim Henson, the creator of the Muppets, owned the trademarks to those characters, and was reluctant to market them at first. He agreed when the CTW promised that the profits from toys, books, computer games, and other products were to be used exclusively to fund the CTW and its outreach efforts. Even though Cooney and the CTW had very little experience with marketing, they demanded complete control over all products and product decisions. Any product line associated with the show had to be educational and inexpensive, and could not be advertised during the show&#x27;s airings. As Davis reported, &quot;Cooney stressed restraint, prudence, and caution&quot; in their marketing and licensing efforts.

Director Jon Stone, talking about the music of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, said: &quot;There was no other sound like it on television.&quot; For the first time in children&#x27;s television, the show&#x27;s songs fulfilled a specific purpose and supported its curriculum. In order to attract the best composers and lyricists, the CTW allowed songwriters like Joe Raposo, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s first musical director, to retain the rights to the songs they wrote, which earned them lucrative profits and helped the show sustain public interest. By 2019, there were 180 albums of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; music produced, and its songwriters had received 11 Grammys. In late 2018, the SW announced a multi-year agreement with Warner Music Group to re-launch Sesame Street Records in the U.S. and Canada. For the first time in 20 years, &quot;an extensive catalog of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; recordings&quot; was made available to the public in a variety of formats, including CD and vinyl compilations, digital streaming, and downloads.

&quot;Sesame Street&quot; used animations and short films commissioned from outside studios, interspersed throughout each episode, to help teach their viewers basic concepts like numbers and letters. Jim Henson was one of the many producers to create short films for the show. Shortly after &quot;Sesame Street&quot; debuted in the United States, the CTW was approached independently by producers from several countries to produce versions of the show at home. These versions came to be called &quot;co-productions.&quot; By 2001 there were over 120 million viewers of all international versions of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, and in 2006, there were twenty co-productions around the world. By its 50th anniversary in 2019, 190 million children viewed over 160 versions of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in 70 languages. In 2005, Doreen Carvajal of &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that income from the co-productions and international licensing accounted for $96 million. &quot;Sesame Street the Musical&quot; opened at Theatre Row off Broadway on September 8, 2022.

In 2015, HBO acquired the production rights to the show, which included an agreement of exclusive rights for nine months at which point the episodes were to be given away free of charge to other networks (e.g. PBS). In December 2024, HBO announced it would part ways with &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

==Cast, crew and characters==

Shortly after the CTW was created in 1968, Joan Ganz Cooney was named its first executive director. She was one of the first female executives in American television. Her appointment was called &quot;one of the most important television developments of the decade.&quot; She assembled a team of producers, all of whom had previously worked on &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;. Jon Stone was responsible for writing, casting, and format; Dave Connell took over animation; and Sam Gibbon served as the show&#x27;s chief liaison between the production staff and the research team. Cameraman Frankie Biondo has worked on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; from its first episode in 1969.

Jim Henson and the Muppets&#x27; involvement in &quot;Sesame Street&quot; began when he and Cooney met at one of the curriculum planning seminars in Boston. Author Christopher Finch reported that Stone, who had worked with Henson previously, felt that if they could not bring him on board, they should &quot;make do without puppets.&quot; Henson was initially reluctant, but he agreed to join &quot;Sesame Street&quot; to meet his own social goals. He also agreed to waive his performance fee for full ownership of the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; Muppets and to split any revenue they generated with the CTW. As Morrow stated, Henson&#x27;s puppets were a crucial part of the show&#x27;s popularity and it brought Henson national attention. Davis reported that Henson was able to take &quot;arcane academic goals&quot; and translate them to &quot;effective and pleasurable viewing.&quot; In early research, the Muppet segments of the show scored high, and more Muppets were added during the first few seasons. Morrow reported that the Muppets were effective teaching tools because children easily recognized them, they were stereotypical and predictable, and they appealed to adults and older siblings.

Although the producers decided against depending upon a single host for &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, instead casting a group of ethnically diverse actors, they realized that a children&#x27;s television program needed to have, as Lesser put it, &quot;a variety of distinctive and reliable personalities,&quot; both human and Muppet. Jon Stone, whose goal was to cast white actors in the minority, was responsible for hiring the show&#x27;s first cast. He did not audition actors until Spring 1969, a few weeks before the five test shows were due to be filmed. Stone videotaped the auditions, and Ed Palmer took them out into the field to test children&#x27;s reactions. The actors who received the &quot;most enthusiastic thumbs up&quot; were cast. For example, Loretta Long was chosen to play Susan when the children who saw her audition stood up and sang along with her rendition of &quot;I&#x27;m a Little Teapot.&quot; Stone stated that casting was the only aspect of the show that was &quot;just completely haphazard.&quot; Most of the cast and crew found jobs on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; through personal relationships with Stone and the other producers. According to puppeteer Marty Robinson in 2019, longevity was common among the show&#x27;s cast and crew.

According to the CTW&#x27;s research, children preferred watching and listening to other children more than to puppets and adults, so they included children in many scenes. Dave Connell insisted that no child actors be used, so these children were non-professionals, unscripted, and spontaneous. Many of their reactions were unpredictable and difficult to control, but the adult cast learned to handle the children&#x27;s spontaneity flexibly, even when it resulted in departures from the planned script or lesson. CTW research also revealed that the children&#x27;s hesitations and on-air mistakes served as models for viewers. According to Morrow, this resulted in the show having a &quot;fresh quality,&quot; especially in its early years.

==Reception==
===Ratings===
When &quot;Sesame Street&quot; premiered on November 10, 1969, it aired on only 67.6% of American televisions, but it earned a 3.3 Nielsen rating, which totaled 1.9 million households. By the show&#x27;s tenth anniversary in 1979, nine million American children under the age of 6 were watching &quot;Sesame Street&quot; daily. According to a 1993 survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Education, out of the show&#x27;s 6.6 million viewers, 2.4 million kindergartners regularly watched it. 77% of preschoolers watched it once a week, and 86% of kindergartners and first- and second-grade students had watched it once a week before starting school. The show reached most young children in almost all demographic groups.

The show&#x27;s ratings significantly decreased in the early 1990s, due to changes in children&#x27;s viewing habits and in the television marketplace. The producers responded by making large-scale structural changes to the show. By 2006, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; had become &quot;the most widely viewed children&#x27;s television show in the world,&quot; with 20 international independent versions and broadcasts in over 120 countries. A 1996 survey found that 95% of all American preschoolers had watched the show by the time they were three years old. In 2008, it was estimated that 77 million Americans had watched the series as children. By the show&#x27;s 40th anniversary in 2009, it was ranked the fifteenth-most-popular children&#x27;s show on television, and by its 50th anniversary in 2019, the show had 100% brand awareness globally. In 2018, the show was the second-highest-rated program on PBS Kids. In 2021, however, the Sesame Street documentary &quot;50 Years of Sunny Days,&quot; which was broadcast nationally on ABC, did not fare well in the ratings, scoring only approximately 2.3 million viewers.

===Influence===

, there were over 1,000 research studies regarding &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s efficacy, impact, and effect on American culture. The CTW solicited the Educational Testing Service (ETS) to conduct summative research on the show. ETS&#x27;s two &quot;landmark&quot; summative evaluations, conducted in 1970 and 1971, demonstrated that the show had a significant educational impact on its viewers. These studies have been cited in other studies of the effects of television on young children. Additional studies conducted throughout &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s history demonstrated that the show continued to have a positive effect on its young viewers.

Lesser believed that &quot;Sesame Street&quot; research &quot;may have conferred a new respectability upon the studies of the effects of visual media upon children.&quot; He also believed that the show had the same effect on the prestige of producing shows for children in the television industry. Historian Robert Morrow, in his book &quot;Sesame Street and the Reform of Children&#x27;s Television&quot;, which chronicled the show&#x27;s influence on children&#x27;s television and on the television industry as a whole, reported that many critics of commercial television saw &quot;Sesame Street&quot; as a &quot;straightforward illustration for reform.&quot; Les Brown, a writer for &quot;Variety&quot;, saw in &quot;Sesame Street&quot; &quot;a hope for a more substantial future&quot; for television.

Morrow reported that the networks responded by creating more high-quality television programs, but that many critics saw them as &quot;appeasement gestures.&quot; According to Morrow, despite the CTW Model&#x27;s effectiveness in creating a popular show, commercial television &quot;made only a limited effort to emulate CTW&#x27;s methods,&quot; and did not use a curriculum or evaluate what children learned from them. By the mid-1970s commercial television had abandoned their experiments with creating better children&#x27;s programming. Other critics hoped that &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, with its depiction of a functioning, multicultural community, would nurture racial tolerance in its young viewers. It was not until the mid-1990s that another children&#x27;s television educational program, &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot;, used the CTW&#x27;s methods to create and modify their content. The creators of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; were influenced by &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, but wanted to use research conducted in the 30 years since its debut. Angela Santomero, one of its producers, said, &quot;We wanted to learn from &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and take it one step further.&quot;

Critic Richard Roeper said that perhaps one of the strongest indicators of the influence of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; has been the enduring rumors and urban legends surrounding the show and its characters, especially speculation concerning the sexuality of Bert and Ernie.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Sesame Street&quot; was praised from its debut in 1969. &quot;Newsday&quot; reported that several newspapers and magazines had written &quot;glowing&quot; reports about the CTW and Cooney. The press overwhelmingly praised the new show; several popular magazines and niche magazines lauded it. In 1970, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; won twenty awards, including a Peabody Award, three Emmys, an award from the Public Relations Society of America, a Clio, and a Prix Jeunesse. By 1995, the show had won two Peabody Awards and four Parents&#x27; Choice Awards. It was the subject of a traveling exhibition by the Smithsonian Institution, and a film exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art.


&quot;Sesame Street&quot; was not without its detractors, however. The state commission in Mississippi, where Henson was from, operated the state&#x27;s PBS member station; in May 1970 it voted to not air &quot;Sesame Street&quot; because of its &quot;highly [racially] integrated cast of children&quot; which &quot;the commission members felt ... Mississippi was not yet ready for.&quot; According to &quot;Children and Television&quot;, Lesser&#x27;s account of the development and early years of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, there was little criticism of the show in the months following its premiere, but it increased at the end of its first season and beginning of the second season. Historian Robert W. Morrow speculated that much of the early criticism, which he called &quot;surprisingly intense,&quot; stemmed from cultural and historical reasons in regards to, as he put it, &quot;the place of children in American society and the controversies about television&#x27;s effects on them.&quot;

According to Morrow, the &quot;most important&quot; studies finding negative effects of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; were conducted by educator Herbert A. Sprigle and psychologist Thomas D. Cook during its first two seasons. Social scientist and Head Start founder Urie Bronfenbrenner criticized the show for being too wholesome. Psychologist Leon Eisenberg saw &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s urban setting as &quot;superficial&quot; and having little to do with the problems confronted by the inner-city child. Head Start director Edward Zigler was probably &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s most vocal critic in the show&#x27;s early years.

In spite of their commitment to multiculturalism, the CTW experienced conflicts with the leadership of minority groups, especially Latino groups and feminists, who objected to &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s depiction of Latinos and women. The CTW took steps to address their objections. By 1971, the CTW hired Hispanic actors, production staff, and researchers, and by the mid-1970s, Morrow reported that &quot;the show included Chicano and Puerto Rican cast members, films about Mexican holidays and foods, and cartoons that taught Spanish words.&quot; As &quot;The New York Times&quot; has stated, creating strong female characters &quot;that make kids laugh, but not...as female stereotypes&quot; has been a challenge for the producers of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. According to Morrow, change regarding how women and girls were depicted on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; occurred slowly. As more female Muppet performers like Camille Bonora, Fran Brill, Pam Arciero, Carmen Osbahr, Stephanie D&#x27;Abruzzo, Jennifer Barnhart, and Leslie Carrara-Rudolph were hired and trained, stronger female characters like Rosita (1991) and Abby Cadabby (2006) were created.

In 2002, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; was ranked number 27 on TV Guide&#x27;s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. Sesame Workshop won a Peabody Award in 2009 for its website, sesamestreet.org, and the show was given Peabody&#x27;s Institutional Award in 2019 for 50 years of educating and entertaining children globally. In 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked the show number 30 on its list of the 60 best TV series. As of 2021, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; has received 205 Emmy Awards, more than any other television series. In 2023, &quot;Variety&quot; ranked &quot;Sesame Street&quot; #12 on its list of the 100 greatest TV shows of all time.

<text>A polder () is a low-lying tract of land that forms an artificial hydrological entity, enclosed by embankments known as dikes. The three types of polder are:

# Land reclaimed from a body of water, such as a lake or the seabed
# Flood plains separated from the sea or river by a dike
# Marshes separated from the surrounding water by a dike and subsequently drained; these are also known as &quot;koogs&quot;, especially in Germany

The ground level in drained marshes subsides over time. All polders will eventually be below the surrounding water level some or all of the time. Water enters the low-lying polder through infiltration and water pressure of groundwater, or rainfall, or transport of water by rivers and canals. This usually means that the polder has an excess of water, which is pumped out or drained by opening sluices at low tide. Care must be taken not to set the internal water level too low. Polder land made up of peat (former marshland) will sink in relation to its previous level, because of peat decomposing when exposed to oxygen from the air. 
Polders are at risk of flooding at all times, and care must be taken to protect the surrounding dikes. Dikes are typically built with locally available materials, and each material has its own risks: sand is prone to collapse owing to saturation by water; dry peat is lighter than water and potentially unable to retain water in very dry seasons. Some animals dig tunnels in the barrier, allowing water to infiltrate the structure; the muskrat is known for this activity and hunted in certain European countries because of it. Polders are most commonly, though not exclusively, found in river deltas, former fenlands, and coastal areas.

Flooding of polders has also been used as a military tactic in the past. One example is the flooding of the polders along the Yser River during World War I. Opening the sluices at high tide and closing them at low tide turned the polders into an inaccessible swamp, which allowed the Allied armies to stop the German army.

The Netherlands has a large area of polders: as much as 20% of the land area has at some point in the past been reclaimed from the sea, thus contributing to the development of the country. IJsselmeer is the most famous polder project of the Netherlands. Some other countries which have polders are Bangladesh, Belgium, Canada and China. Some examples of Dutch polder projects are Beemster, Schermer, Flevopolder and Noordoostpolder.

==Etymology==
The Dutch word derives successively from Middle Dutch , from Old Dutch , and ultimately from &quot;pol-&quot;, a piece of land elevated above its surroundings, with the augmentative suffix &quot;-er&quot; and epenthetical &quot; -d-&quot;. The word has been adopted in thirty-six languages.

==Netherlands==


The Netherlands is frequently associated with polders, as its engineers became noted for developing techniques to drain wetlands and make them usable for agriculture and other development. This is illustrated by the saying &quot;God created the world, but the Dutch created the Netherlands&quot;.

The Dutch have a long history of reclamation of marshes and fenland, resulting in some 3,000 &quot;polders&quot; nationwide. By 1961, about half of the country&#x27;s land, , was reclaimed from the sea. About half the total surface area of &quot;polders&quot; in northwest Europe is in the Netherlands. The first embankments in Europe were constructed in Roman times. The first polders were constructed in the 11th century. The oldest extant polder is the Achtermeer polder, from 1533.

As a result of flooding disasters, water boards called &quot;waterschap&quot; (when situated more inland) or &quot;hoogheemraadschap&quot; (near the sea, mainly used in the Holland region) were set up to maintain the integrity of the water defences around polders, maintain the waterways inside a polder, and control the various water levels inside and outside the polder. Water boards hold separate elections, levy taxes, and function independently from other government bodies. Their function is basically unchanged even today. As such, they are the oldest democratic institutions in the country. The necessary cooperation among all ranks to maintain polder integrity gave its name to the Dutch version of third-way politics—the &quot;Polder Model&quot;.

The 1953 flood disaster prompted a new approach to the design of dikes and other water-retaining structures, based on an acceptable probability of overflowing. Risk is defined as the product of probability and consequences. The potential damage in lives, property, and rebuilding costs is compared with the potential cost of water defences. From these calculations follows an acceptable flood risk from the sea at one in 4,000–10,000 years, while it is one in 100–2,500 years for a river flood. The particular established policy guides the Dutch government to improve flood defences as new data on threat levels become available.

Major Dutch polders and the years they were laid dry include Beemster (1609–1612), Schermer (1633–1635), and Haarlemmermeerpolder (1852). Polders created as part of the Zuiderzee Works include Wieringermeerpolder (1930), Noordoostpolder (1942) and Flevopolder (1956–1968)

== Examples of polders ==
===Brazil===
Several cities on the Paraíba Valley region (in the state of São Paulo) have polders on land claimed from the floodplains around the Paraíba do Sul river.

===Bangladesh===
Bangladesh has 139 polders, of which 49 are sea-facing, while the rest are along the numerous distributaries of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River delta. These were constructed in the 1960s to protect the coast from tidal flooding and reduce salinity incursion. They reduce long-term flooding and waterlogging following storm surges from tropical cyclones. They are also cultivated for agriculture.

===Belgium===

* De Moeren, near Veurne in West Flanders
* Polders along the Yser river between Nieuwpoort and Diksmuide
* Polders of Muisbroek and Ettenhoven, in Ekeren and Hoevenen
* Polder of Stabroek, in Stabroek
* Kabeljauwpolder, in Zandvliet
* Scheldepolders on the left bank of the Scheldt
* Uitkerkse polders, near Blankenberge in West Flanders
* Prosperpolder, near Doel, Antwerp and Kieldrecht.

===Canada===
* Tantramar Marshes
* Holland Marsh
* Pitt Polder Ecological Reserve
* Grand Pré, Nova Scotia
* Minas Basin

=== China ===

* The city of Kunshan has over 100 polders.

====History====
The Jiangnan region, at the Yangtze River Delta, has a long history of constructing polders. Most of these projects were performed between the 10th and 13th centuries. The Chinese government also assisted local communities in constructing dikes for swampland water drainage. The Lijia (里甲) self-monitoring system of 110 households under a &quot;lizhang&quot; (里长) headman was used for the purposes of service administration and tax collection in the polder, with a &quot;liangzhang&quot; (粮长, grain chief) responsible for maintaining the water system and a &quot;tangzhang&quot; (塘长, dike chief) for polder maintenance.

===Denmark===
* Filsø
* Kolindsund
* Lammefjorden

===Finland===
* Söderfjärden
* Munsmo
* Two polders ( in total) near Vassor in Korsholm

===France===
* Marais Poitevin
* Les Moëres, adjacent to the Flemish polder &quot;De Moeren&quot; in Belgium.
* Polders de Couesnon near Mont-Saint Michel in Normandy

===Germany===

In Germany, land reclaimed by diking is called a &quot;koog&quot;. The German &quot;Deichgraf&quot; system was similar to the Dutch and is widely known from Theodor Storm&#x27;s novella &quot;The Rider on the White Horse&quot;.

* Altes Land near Hamburg
* Blockland and Hollerland near Bremen
* Nordstrand, Germany
* Bormerkoog and Meggerkoog near Friedrichstadt
* 36 &quot;koogs&quot; in the district of Nordfriesland
* 12 &quot;koogs&quot; in the district of Dithmarschen

In southern Germany, the term &quot;polder&quot; is used for retention basins recreated by opening dikes during river floodplain restoration, a meaning somewhat opposite to that in coastal context.

<doc id="48068" wikidata="Q1178" url="?curid=48068" title="Maurice Ravel">
<text>Joseph Maurice Ravel (7 March 1875 – 28 December 1937) was a French composer, pianist and conductor. He is often associated with Impressionism along with his elder contemporary Claude Debussy, although both composers rejected the term. In the 1920s and 1930s Ravel was internationally regarded as France&#x27;s greatest living composer.

Born to a music-loving family, Ravel attended France&#x27;s premier music college, the Paris Conservatoire; he was not well regarded by its conservative establishment, whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal. After leaving the conservatoire, Ravel found his own way as a composer, developing a style of great clarity and incorporating elements of modernism, baroque, neoclassicism and, in his later works, jazz. He liked to experiment with musical form, as in his best-known work, &quot;Boléro&quot; (1928), in which repetition takes the place of development. Renowned for his abilities in orchestration, Ravel made some orchestral arrangements of other composers&#x27; piano music, of which his 1922 version of Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; is the best known.

A slow and painstaking worker, Ravel composed fewer pieces than many of his contemporaries. Among his works to enter the repertoire are pieces for piano, chamber music, two piano concertos, ballet music, two operas and eight song cycles; he wrote no symphonies or church music. Many of his works exist in two versions: first, a piano score and later an orchestration. Some of his piano music, such as &quot;Gaspard de la nuit&quot; (1908), is exceptionally difficult to play, and his complex orchestral works such as &quot;Daphnis et Chloé&quot; (1912) require skilful balance in performance.

Ravel was among the first composers to recognise the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public. From the 1920s, despite limited technique as a pianist or conductor, he took part in recordings of several of his works; others were made under his supervision.

==Life and career==

===Early years===

Ravel was born in the Basque town of Ciboure, France, near Biarritz, from the Spanish border. His father, Pierre-Joseph Ravel, was an educated and successful engineer, inventor and manufacturer, born in Versoix near the Franco-Swiss border. His mother, Marie, &quot;née&quot; Delouart, was Basque but had grown up in Madrid. In 19th-century terms, Joseph had married beneath his status – Marie was illegitimate and barely literate – but the marriage was a happy one. Some of Joseph&#x27;s inventions were successful, including an early internal combustion engine and a notorious circus machine, the &quot;Whirlwind of Death&quot;, an automotive loop-the-loop that was a major attraction until a fatal accident at Barnum and Bailey&#x27;s Circus in 1903.

Both Ravel&#x27;s parents were Roman Catholics; Marie was also something of a free-thinker, a trait inherited by her elder son. He was baptised in the Ciboure parish church six days after he was born. The family moved to Paris three months later, and there a younger son, Édouard, was born. (He was close to his father, whom he eventually followed into the engineering profession.) Maurice was particularly devoted to their mother; her Basque-Spanish heritage was a strong influence on his life and music. Among his earliest memories were folk songs she sang to him. The household was not rich, but the family was comfortable, and the two boys had happy childhoods.

Ravel senior delighted in taking his sons to factories to see the latest mechanical devices, but he also had a keen interest in music and culture in general. In later life, Ravel recalled, &quot;Throughout my childhood I was sensitive to music. My father, much better educated in this art than most amateurs are, knew how to develop my taste and to stimulate my enthusiasm at an early age.&quot; There is no record that Ravel received any formal general schooling in his early years; his biographer Roger Nichols suggests that the boy may have been chiefly educated by his father.

When he was seven, Ravel started piano lessons with Henri Ghys, a friend of Emmanuel Chabrier; five years later, in 1887, he began studying harmony, counterpoint and composition with Charles-René, a pupil of Léo Delibes. Without being anything of a child prodigy, he was a highly musical boy. Charles-René found that Ravel&#x27;s conception of music was natural to him &quot;and not, as in the case of so many others, the result of effort&quot;. Ravel&#x27;s earliest known compositions date from this period: variations on a chorale by Schumann, variations on a theme by Grieg and a single movement of a piano sonata. They survive only in fragmentary form.

In 1888 Ravel met the young pianist Ricardo Viñes, who became not only a lifelong friend, but also one of the foremost interpreters of his works, and an important link between Ravel and Spanish music. The two shared an appreciation of Wagner, Russian music, and the writings of Poe, Baudelaire and Mallarmé. At the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889, Ravel was much struck by the new Russian works conducted by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. This music had a lasting effect on both Ravel and his older contemporary Claude Debussy, as did the exotic sound of the Javanese gamelan, also heard during the Exposition.

Émile Decombes took over as Ravel&#x27;s piano teacher in 1889; in the same year Ravel gave his earliest public performance. Aged fourteen, he took part in a concert at the Salle Érard along with other pupils of Decombes, including Reynaldo Hahn and Alfred Cortot.

===Paris Conservatoire===
With the encouragement of his parents, Ravel applied for entry to France&#x27;s most important musical college, the Conservatoire de Paris. In November 1889, playing music by Chopin, he passed the examination for admission to the preparatory piano class run by Eugène Anthiome. Ravel won the first prize in the Conservatoire&#x27;s piano competition in 1891, but otherwise he did not stand out as a student. Nevertheless, these years were a time of considerable advance in his development as a composer. The musicologist Arbie Orenstein writes that for Ravel the 1890s were a period &quot;of immense growth... from adolescence to maturity&quot;.
In 1891 Ravel progressed to the classes of Charles-Wilfrid de Bériot, for piano, and Émile Pessard, for harmony. He made solid, unspectacular progress, with particular encouragement from Bériot but, in the words of the musicologist Barbara L. Kelly, he &quot;was only teachable on his own terms&quot;. His later teacher Gabriel Fauré understood this, but it was not generally acceptable to the conservative faculty of the Conservatoire of the 1890s. Ravel was expelled in 1895, having won no more prizes. His earliest works to survive in full are from these student days: &quot;Sérénade grotesque&quot;, for piano, and &quot;Ballade de la Reine morte d&#x27;aimer&quot;, a &quot;mélodie&quot; setting a poem by Roland de Marès (both 1893).

Ravel was never so assiduous a student of the piano as his colleagues such as Viñes and Cortot were. It was plain that as a pianist he would never match them, and his overriding ambition was to be a composer. From this point he concentrated on composition. His works from the period include the songs &quot;Un grand sommeil noir&quot; and &quot;D&#x27;Anne jouant de l&#x27;espinette&quot; to words by Paul Verlaine and Clément Marot, and the piano pieces &quot;Menuet antique&quot; and &quot;Habanera&quot; (for four hands), the latter eventually incorporated into the &quot;Rapsodie espagnole&quot;. At around this time, Joseph Ravel introduced his son to Erik Satie, who was earning a living as a café pianist. Ravel was one of the first musicians – Debussy was another – who recognised Satie&#x27;s originality and talent. Satie&#x27;s constant experiments in musical form were an inspiration to Ravel, who counted them &quot;of inestimable value&quot;.
In 1897 Ravel was readmitted to the Conservatoire, studying composition with Fauré, and taking private lessons in counterpoint with André Gedalge. Both these teachers, particularly Fauré, regarded him highly and were key influences on his development as a composer. As Ravel&#x27;s course progressed, Fauré reported &quot;a distinct gain in maturity... engaging wealth of imagination&quot;. Ravel&#x27;s standing at the Conservatoire was nevertheless undermined by the hostility of the Director, Théodore Dubois, who deplored the young man&#x27;s musically and politically progressive outlook. Consequently, according to a fellow student, Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi, he was &quot;a marked man, against whom all weapons were good&quot;. He wrote some substantial works while studying with Fauré, including the overture &quot;Shéhérazade&quot; and a single movement violin sonata, but he won no prizes, and therefore was expelled again in 1900. As a former student he was allowed to attend Fauré&#x27;s classes as a non-participating &quot;auditeur&quot; until finally abandoning the Conservatoire in 1903.

In May 1897 Ravel conducted the first performance of the &quot;Shéhérazade&quot; overture, which had a mixed reception, with boos mingling with applause from the audience, and unflattering reviews from the critics. One described the piece as &quot;a jolting debut: a clumsy plagiarism of the Russian School&quot; and called Ravel a &quot;mediocrely gifted debutant... who will perhaps become something if not someone in about ten years, if he works hard&quot;. Another critic, Pierre Lalo, thought that Ravel showed talent, but was too indebted to Debussy and should instead emulate Beethoven. Over the succeeding decades Lalo became Ravel&#x27;s most implacable critic. In 1899 Ravel composed his first piece to become widely known, though it made little impact initially: &quot;Pavane pour une infante défunte&quot; (&quot;Pavane for a dead princess&quot;). It was originally a solo piano work, commissioned by the Princesse de Polignac.

From the start of his career, Ravel appeared calmly indifferent to blame or praise. Those who knew him well believed that this was no pose but wholly genuine. The only opinion of his music that he truly valued was his own, perfectionist and severely self-critical. At twenty years of age he was, in the words of the biographer Burnett James, &quot;self-possessed, a little aloof, intellectually biased, given to mild banter&quot;. He dressed like a dandy and was meticulous about his appearance and demeanour. Orenstein comments that, short in stature, light in frame and bony in features, Ravel had the &quot;appearance of a well-dressed jockey&quot;, whose large head seemed suitably matched to his formidable intellect. During the late 1890s and into the early years of the next century, Ravel was bearded in the fashion of the day; from his mid-thirties he was clean-shaven.

===Les Apaches and Debussy===
Around 1900 Ravel and a number of innovative young artists, poets, critics and musicians joined together in an informal group; they came to be known as Les Apaches (&quot;The Hooligans&quot;), a name coined by Viñes to represent their status as &quot;artistic outcasts&quot;. They met regularly until the beginning of the First World War, and members stimulated one another with intellectual argument and performances of their works. The membership of the group was fluid, and at various times included Igor Stravinsky and Manuel de Falla as well as their French friends.

Among the enthusiasms of the Apaches was the music of Debussy. Ravel, twelve years his junior, had known Debussy slightly since the 1890s, and their friendship, though never close, continued for more than ten years. In 1902 André Messager conducted the premiere of Debussy&#x27;s opera&quot; Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; at the Opéra-Comique. It divided musical opinion. Dubois unavailingly forbade Conservatoire students to attend, and the conductor&#x27;s friend and former teacher Camille Saint-Saëns was prominent among those who detested the piece. The Apaches were loud in their support. The first run of the opera consisted of fourteen performances: Ravel attended all of them.
Debussy was widely held to be an Impressionist composer – a label he intensely disliked. Many music lovers began to apply the same term to Ravel, and the works of the two composers were frequently taken as part of a single genre. Ravel thought that Debussy was indeed an Impressionist but that he himself was not. Orenstein comments that Debussy was more spontaneous and casual in his composing while Ravel was more attentive to form and craftsmanship. Ravel wrote that Debussy&#x27;s &quot;genius was obviously one of great individuality, creating its own laws, constantly in evolution, expressing itself freely, yet always faithful to French tradition. For Debussy, the musician and the man, I have had profound admiration, but by nature I am different from Debussy... I think I have always personally followed a direction opposed to that of [his] symbolism.&quot; During the first years of the new century Ravel&#x27;s new works included the piano piece &quot;Jeux d&#x27;eau&quot; (1901), the String Quartet and the orchestral song cycle &quot;Shéhérazade&quot; (both 1903). Commentators have noted some Debussian touches in some parts of these works. Nichols calls the quartet &quot;at once homage to and exorcism of Debussy&#x27;s influence&quot;.

The two composers ceased to be on friendly terms in the middle of the first decade of the 1900s, for musical and possibly personal reasons. Their admirers began to form factions, with adherents of one composer denigrating the other. Disputes arose about the chronology of the composers&#x27; works and who influenced whom. Prominent in the anti-Ravel camp was Lalo, who wrote, &quot;Where M. Debussy is all sensitivity, M. Ravel is all insensitivity, borrowing without hesitation not only technique but the sensitivity of other people.&quot; The public tension led to personal estrangement. Ravel said, &quot;It&#x27;s probably better for us, after all, to be on frigid terms for illogical reasons.&quot; Nichols suggests an additional reason for the rift. In 1904 Debussy left his wife and went to live with the singer Emma Bardac. Ravel, together with his close friend and confidante Misia Edwards and the opera star Lucienne Bréval, contributed to a modest regular income for the deserted Lilly Debussy, a fact that Nichols suggests may have rankled with her husband.

===Scandal and success===
During the first years of the new century Ravel made five attempts to win France&#x27;s most prestigious prize for young composers, the Prix de Rome, past winners of which included Berlioz, Gounod, Bizet, Massenet and Debussy. In 1900 Ravel was eliminated in the first round; in 1901 he won the second prize for the competition. In 1902 and 1903 he won nothing: according to the musicologist Paul Landormy, the judges suspected Ravel of making fun of them by submitting cantatas so academic as to seem like parodies. In 1905 Ravel, by now thirty, competed for the last time, inadvertently causing a &quot;furore&quot;. He was eliminated in the first round, which even critics unsympathetic to his music, including Lalo, denounced as unjustifiable. The press&#x27;s indignation grew when it emerged that the senior professor at the Conservatoire, Charles Lenepveu, was on the jury, and only his students were selected for the final round; his insistence that this was pure coincidence was not well received. &quot;L&#x27;affaire Ravel&quot; became a national scandal, leading to the early retirement of Dubois and his replacement by Fauré, appointed by the government to carry out a radical reorganisation of the Conservatoire.

Among those taking a close interest in the controversy was Alfred Edwards, owner and editor of &quot;Le Matin&quot;, for which Lalo wrote. Edwards was married to Ravel&#x27;s friend Misia; the couple took Ravel on a seven-week Rhine cruise on their yacht in June and July 1905, the first time he had travelled abroad.

By the latter part of the 1900s Ravel had established a pattern of writing works for piano and subsequently arranging them for full orchestra. He was in general a slow and painstaking worker, and reworking his earlier piano compositions enabled him to increase the number of pieces published and performed. There appears to have been no mercenary motive for this; Ravel was known for his indifference to financial matters. The pieces that began as piano compositions and were then given orchestral dress were &quot;Pavane pour une infante défunte&quot; (orchestrated 1910), &quot;Une barque sur l&#x27;océan&quot; (1906, from the 1905 piano suite &quot;Miroirs&quot;), the Habanera section of &quot;Rapsodie espagnole&quot; (1907–08), &quot;Ma mère l&#x27;Oye&quot; (1908–10, orchestrated 1911), &quot;Valses nobles et sentimentales&quot; (1911, orchestrated 1912), &quot;Alborada del gracioso&quot; (from &quot;Miroirs&quot;, orchestrated 1918) and &quot;Le tombeau de Couperin&quot; (1914–17, orchestrated 1919).
Ravel was not by inclination a teacher, but he gave lessons to a few young musicians he felt could benefit from them. Manuel Rosenthal was one, and records that Ravel was a very demanding teacher when he thought his pupil had talent. Like his own teacher, Fauré, he was concerned that his pupils should find their own individual voices and not be excessively influenced by established masters. He warned Rosenthal that it was impossible to learn from studying Debussy&#x27;s music: &quot;Only Debussy could have written it and made it sound like only Debussy can sound.&quot; When George Gershwin asked him for lessons in the 1920s, Ravel, after serious consideration, refused, on the grounds that they &quot;would probably cause him to write bad Ravel and lose his great gift of melody and spontaneity&quot;. The best-known composer who studied with Ravel was probably Ralph Vaughan Williams, who was his pupil for three months in 1907–08. Vaughan Williams recalled that Ravel helped him escape from &quot;the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner... &quot;Complexe mais pas compliqué&quot; was his motto.&quot;

Vaughan Williams&#x27;s recollections throw some light on Ravel&#x27;s private life, about which the latter&#x27;s reserved and secretive personality has led to much speculation. Vaughan Williams, Rosenthal and Marguerite Long have all recorded that Ravel frequented brothels; Long attributed this to his self-consciousness about his diminutive stature, and consequent lack of confidence with women. By other accounts, none of them first-hand, Ravel was in love with Misia Edwards, or wanted to marry the violinist Hélène Jourdan-Morhange. Rosenthal records and discounts contemporary speculation that Ravel, a lifelong bachelor, may have been homosexual. Such speculation recurred in a 2000 life of Ravel by Benjamin Ivry; subsequent studies have concluded that Ravel&#x27;s sexuality and personal life remain a mystery.

Ravel&#x27;s first concert outside France was in 1909. As the guest of the Vaughan Williamses, he visited London, where he played for the Société des Concerts Français, gaining favourable reviews and enhancing his growing international reputation.

===1910 to First World War===

The Société Nationale de Musique, founded in 1871 to promote the music of rising French composers, had been dominated since the mid-1880s by a conservative faction led by Vincent d&#x27;Indy. Ravel, together with several other former pupils of Fauré, set up a new, modernist organisation, the Société Musicale Indépendente, with Fauré as its president. The new society&#x27;s inaugural concert took place on 20 April 1910; the seven items on the programme included premieres of Fauré&#x27;s song cycle &quot;La chanson d&#x27;Ève&quot;, Debussy&#x27;s piano suite &quot;D&#x27;un cahier d&#x27;esquisses&quot;, Zoltán Kodály&#x27;s &quot;Six pièces pour piano&quot; and the original piano duet version of Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Ma mère l&#x27;Oye&quot;. The performers included Fauré, Florent Schmitt, Ernest Bloch, Pierre Monteux and, in the Debussy work, Ravel. Kelly considers it a sign of Ravel&#x27;s new influence that the society featured Satie&#x27;s music in a concert in January 1911.

The first of Ravel&#x27;s two operas, the one-act comedy &quot;L&#x27;heure espagnole&quot; was premiered in 1911. The work had been completed in 1907, but the manager of the Opéra-Comique, Albert Carré, repeatedly deferred its presentation. He was concerned that its plot – a bedroom farce – would be badly received by the ultra-respectable mothers and daughters who were an important part of the Opéra-Comique&#x27;s audience. The piece was only modestly successful at its first production, and it was not until the 1920s that it became popular.
In 1912 Ravel had three ballets premiered. The first, to the orchestrated and expanded version of &quot;Ma mère l&#x27;Oye&quot;, opened at the Théâtre des Arts in January. The reviews were excellent: the &quot;Mercure de France&quot; called the score &quot;absolutely ravishing, a masterwork in miniature&quot;. The music rapidly entered the concert repertoire; it was played at the Queen&#x27;s Hall, London, within weeks of the Paris premiere, and was repeated at the Proms later in the same year. &quot;The Times&quot; praised &quot;the enchantment of the work... the effect of mirage, by which something quite real seems to float on nothing&quot;. New York audiences heard the work in the same year. Ravel&#x27;s second ballet of 1912 was &quot;Adélaïde ou le langage des fleurs&quot;, danced to the score of &quot;Valses nobles et sentimentales&quot;, which opened at the Châtelet in April. &quot;Daphnis et Chloé&quot; opened at the same theatre in June. This was his largest-scale orchestral work, and took him immense trouble and several years to complete.

&quot;Daphnis et Chloé&quot; was commissioned in or about 1909 by the impresario Sergei Diaghilev for his company, the Ballets Russes. Ravel began work with Diaghilev&#x27;s choreographer, Michel Fokine, and designer, Léon Bakst. Fokine had a reputation for his modern approach to dance, with individual numbers replaced by continuous music. This appealed to Ravel, and after discussing the action in great detail with Fokine, Ravel began composing the music. There were frequent disagreements between the collaborators, and the premiere was under-rehearsed because of the late completion of the work. It had an unenthusiastic reception and was quickly withdrawn, although it was revived successfully a year later in Monte Carlo and London. The effort to complete the ballet took its toll on Ravel&#x27;s health; neurasthenia obliged him to rest for several months after the premiere.

Ravel composed little during 1913. He collaborated with Stravinsky on a performing version of Mussorgsky&#x27;s unfinished opera &quot;Khovanshchina&quot;, and his own works were the &quot;Trois poèmes de Mallarmé&quot; for soprano and chamber ensemble, and two short piano pieces, &quot;À la manière de Borodine&quot; and &quot;À la manière de Chabrier&quot;. In 1913, together with Debussy, Ravel was among the musicians present at the dress rehearsal of &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;. Stravinsky later said that Ravel was the only person who immediately understood the music. Ravel predicted that the premiere of the &quot;Rite&quot; would be seen as an event of historic importance equal to that of &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;.

===War===

When Germany invaded France in 1914 Ravel tried to join the French Air Force. He considered his small stature and light weight ideal for an aviator, but was rejected because of his age and a minor heart complaint. While waiting to be enlisted, Ravel composed &quot;Trois Chansons&quot;, his only work for a cappella choir, setting his own texts in the tradition of French 16th-century chansons. He dedicated the three songs to people who might help him to enlist. After several unsuccessful attempts to enlist, Ravel finally joined the Thirteenth Artillery Regiment as a lorry driver in March 1915, when he was forty. Stravinsky expressed admiration for his friend&#x27;s courage: &quot;at his age and with his name he could have had an easier place, or done nothing&quot;. Some of Ravel&#x27;s duties put him in mortal danger, driving munitions at night under heavy German bombardment. At the same time his peace of mind was undermined by his mother&#x27;s failing health. His own health also deteriorated; he suffered from insomnia and digestive problems, underwent a bowel operation following amoebic dysentery in September 1916, and had frostbite in his feet the following winter.

During the war the Ligue Nationale pour la Defense de la Musique Française was formed by Saint-Saëns, Dubois, d&#x27;Indy and others, campaigning for a ban on the performance of contemporary German music. Ravel declined to join, telling the committee of the league in 1916, &quot;It would be dangerous for French composers to ignore systematically the productions of their foreign colleagues, and thus form themselves into a sort of national coterie: our musical art, which is so rich at the present time, would soon degenerate, becoming isolated in banal formulas.&quot; The league responded by banning Ravel&#x27;s music from its concerts.

Ravel&#x27;s mother died in January 1917, and he fell into a &quot;horrible despair&quot;, compounding the distress he felt at the suffering endured by the people of his country during the war. He composed few works in the war years. The Piano Trio was almost complete when the conflict began, and the most substantial of his wartime works is &quot;Le tombeau de Couperin&quot;, composed between 1914 and 1917. The suite celebrates the tradition of François Couperin, the 18th-century French composer; each movement is dedicated to a friend of Ravel&#x27;s who died in the war.

===1920s===
After the war, those close to Ravel recognised that he had lost much of his physical and mental stamina. As the musicologist Stephen Zank puts it, &quot;Ravel&#x27;s emotional equilibrium, so hard won in the previous decade, had been seriously compromised.&quot; His output, never large, became smaller. Nonetheless, after the death of Debussy in 1918, he was generally seen, in France and abroad, as the leading French composer of the era. Fauré wrote to him, &quot;I am happier than you can imagine about the solid position which you occupy and which you have acquired so brilliantly and so rapidly. It is a source of joy and pride for your old professor.&quot; Ravel was offered the Legion of Honour in 1920, and although he declined the decoration, he was viewed by the new generation of composers typified by Satie&#x27;s protégés Les Six as an establishment figure. Satie had turned against him, and commented, &quot;Ravel refuses the Légion d&#x27;honneur, but all his music accepts it.&quot; Despite this attack, Ravel continued to admire Satie&#x27;s early music, and always acknowledged the older man&#x27;s influence on his own development. Ravel took a benign view of Les Six, promoting their music, and defending it against journalistic attacks. He regarded their reaction against his works as natural, and preferable to their copying his style. Through the Société Musicale Indépendente, he was able to encourage them and composers from other countries. The Société presented concerts of recent works by American composers including Aaron Copland, Virgil Thomson and George Antheil and by Vaughan Williams and his English colleagues Arnold Bax and Cyril Scott.
Orenstein and Zank both comment that, although Ravel&#x27;s post-war output was small, averaging only one composition a year, it included some of his finest works. In 1920 he completed &quot;La valse&quot;, in response to a commission from Diaghilev. He had worked on it intermittently for some years, planning a concert piece, &quot;a sort of apotheosis of the Viennese waltz, mingled with, in my mind, the impression of a fantastic, fatal whirling&quot;. It was rejected by Diaghilev, who said, &quot;It&#x27;s a masterpiece, but it&#x27;s not a ballet. It&#x27;s the portrait of a ballet.&quot; Ravel heard Diaghilev&#x27;s verdict without protest or argument, left, and had no further dealings with him. Nichols comments that Ravel had the satisfaction of seeing the ballet staged twice by other managements before Diaghilev died. A ballet danced to the orchestral version of &quot;Le tombeau de Couperin&quot; was given at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées in November 1920, and the premiere of &quot;La valse&quot; followed in December. The following year &quot;Daphnis et Chloé&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;heure espagnole&quot; were successfully revived at the Paris Opéra.

In the post-war era there was a reaction against the large-scale music of composers such as Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss. Stravinsky, whose &quot;Rite of Spring&quot; was written for a huge orchestra, began to work on a much smaller scale. His 1923 ballet score &quot;Les noces&quot; is composed for voices and twenty-one instruments. Ravel did not like the work (his opinion caused a cooling in Stravinsky&#x27;s friendship with him) but he was in sympathy with the fashion for &quot;dépouillement&quot; – the &quot;stripping away&quot; of pre-war extravagance to reveal the essentials. Many of his works from the 1920s are noticeably sparer in texture than earlier pieces. Other influences on him in this period were jazz and atonality. Jazz was popular in Parisian cafés, and French composers such as Darius Milhaud incorporated elements of it in their work. Ravel commented that he preferred jazz to grand opera, and its influence is heard in his later music. Arnold Schönberg&#x27;s abandonment of conventional tonality also had echoes in some of Ravel&#x27;s music such as the &quot;Chansons madécasses&quot; (1926), which Ravel doubted he could have written without the example of &quot;Pierrot Lunaire&quot;. His other major works from the 1920s include the orchestral arrangement of Mussorgsky&#x27;s piano suite &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; (1922), the opera &quot;L&#x27;enfant et les sortilèges&quot; to a libretto by Colette (1926), &quot;Tzigane&quot; (1924) and the Violin Sonata No.2 (1927).

Finding city life fatiguing, Ravel moved to the countryside. In May 1921 he took up residence at Le Belvédère, a small house on the fringe of Montfort-l&#x27;Amaury, west of Paris, in the Seine-et-Oise département. Looked after by a devoted housekeeper, Mme Revelot, he lived there for the rest of his life. At Le Belvédère Ravel composed and gardened, when not performing in Paris or abroad. His touring schedule increased considerably in the 1920s, with concerts in Britain, Sweden, Denmark, the US, Canada, Spain, Austria and Italy.

 After two months of planning, Ravel made a four-month tour of North America in 1928, playing and conducting. His fee was a guaranteed minimum of $10,000 and a constant supply of Gauloises cigarettes. He appeared with most of the leading orchestras in Canada and the US and visited twenty-five cities. Audiences were enthusiastic and the critics were complimentary. At an all-Ravel programme conducted by Serge Koussevitzky in New York, the entire audience stood up and applauded as the composer took his seat. Ravel was touched by this spontaneous gesture and observed, &quot;You know, this doesn&#x27;t happen to me in Paris.&quot; Orenstein, commenting that this tour marked the zenith of Ravel&#x27;s international reputation, lists its non-musical highlights as a visit to Poe&#x27;s house in New York, and excursions to Niagara Falls and the Grand Canyon. Ravel was unmoved by his new international celebrity. He commented that the critics&#x27; recent enthusiasm was of no more importance than their earlier judgment, when they called him &quot;the most perfect example of insensitivity and lack of emotion&quot;.

The last composition Ravel completed in the 1920s, &quot;Boléro&quot;, became his most famous. He was commissioned to provide a score for Ida Rubinstein&#x27;s ballet company, and having been unable to secure the rights to orchestrate Albéniz&#x27;s &quot;Iberia&quot;, he decided on &quot;an experiment in a very special and limited direction... a piece lasting seventeen minutes and consisting wholly of orchestral tissue without music&quot;. Ravel continued that the work was &quot;one long, very gradual crescendo. There are no contrasts, and there is practically no invention except the plan and the manner of the execution. The themes are altogether impersonal.&quot; He was astonished, and not wholly pleased, that it became a mass success. When one elderly member of the audience at the Opéra shouted &quot;Rubbish!&quot; at the premiere, he remarked, &quot;That old lady got the message!&quot; The work was popularised by the conductor Arturo Toscanini, and has been recorded several hundred times. Ravel commented to Arthur Honegger, one of Les Six, &quot;I&#x27;ve written only one masterpiece – &quot;Boléro&quot;. Unfortunately there&#x27;s no music in it.&quot;

===Last years===
At the beginning of the 1930s Ravel was working on two piano concertos. He completed the Piano Concerto in D major for the Left Hand first. It was commissioned by the Austrian pianist Paul Wittgenstein, who had lost his right arm during the First World War. Ravel was stimulated by the technical challenges of the project: &quot;In a work of this kind, it is essential to give the impression of a texture no thinner than that of a part written for both hands.&quot; Ravel, not proficient enough to perform the work with only his left hand, demonstrated it with both hands. Wittgenstein was initially disappointed by the piece, but after long study he became fascinated by it and ranked it as a great work. In January 1932 he premiered it in Vienna to instant acclaim, and performed it in Paris with Ravel conducting the following year. The critic Henry Prunières wrote, &quot;From the opening measures, we are plunged into a world in which Ravel has but rarely introduced us.&quot;

The Piano Concerto in G major was completed a year later. After the premiere in January 1932 there was high praise for the soloist, Marguerite Long, and for Ravel&#x27;s score, though not for his conducting. Long, the dedicatee, played the concerto in more than twenty European cities, with the composer conducting; they planned to record it together, but at the sessions Ravel confined himself to supervising proceedings and Pedro de Freitas Branco conducted.
In October 1932 Ravel suffered a blow to the head in a taxi accident. The injury was not thought serious at the time, but in a study for the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; in 1988 the neurologist R. A. Henson concludes that it may have exacerbated an existing cerebral condition. As early as 1927 close friends had been concerned at Ravel&#x27;s growing absent-mindedness, and within a year of the accident he started to experience symptoms suggesting aphasia. Before the accident he had begun work on music for a film, &quot;Don Quixote&quot; (1933), but he was unable to meet the production schedule, and Jacques Ibert wrote most of the score. Ravel completed three songs for baritone and orchestra intended for the film; they were published as &quot;Don Quichotte à Dulcinée&quot;. The manuscript orchestral score is in Ravel&#x27;s hand, but Lucien Garban and Manuel Rosenthal helped in transcription. Ravel composed no more after this. The exact nature of his illness is unknown. Experts have ruled out the possibility of a tumour, and have variously suggested frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. Though no longer able to write music or perform, Ravel remained physically and socially active until his last months. Henson notes that Ravel preserved most or all his auditory imagery and could still hear music in his head.

In 1937 Ravel began to suffer pain from his condition, and was examined by Clovis Vincent, a well-known Paris neurosurgeon. Vincent advised surgical treatment. He thought a tumour unlikely, and expected to find ventriculomegaly from hydrocephalus that surgery might prevent from progressing. Ravel&#x27;s brother Edouard accepted this advice; as Henson comments, the patient was in no state to express a considered view. After the operation there seemed to be an improvement in his condition, but it was short-lived, and he soon lapsed into a coma. He died on 28 December, at the age of 62.

On 30 December 1937 Ravel was interred next to his parents in a granite tomb at Levallois-Perret cemetery, in north-west Paris. He was an atheist and there was no religious ceremony.

==Music==

Marcel Marnat&#x27;s catalogue of Ravel&#x27;s complete works lists eighty-five works, including many incomplete or abandoned. Though that total is small in comparison with the output of his major contemporaries, it is nevertheless inflated by Ravel&#x27;s frequent practice of writing works for piano and later rewriting them as independent pieces for orchestra. The performable body of works numbers about sixty; slightly more than half are instrumental. Ravel&#x27;s music includes pieces for piano, chamber music, two piano concerti, ballet music, opera and song cycles. He wrote no symphonies or church works.

Ravel drew on many generations of French composers from Couperin and Rameau to Fauré and the more recent innovations of Satie and Debussy. Foreign influences include Mozart, Schubert, Liszt and Chopin. He considered himself in many ways a classicist, often using traditional structures and forms, such as the ternary, to present his new melodic and rhythmic content and innovative harmonies. The influence of jazz on his later music is heard within conventional classical structures in the Piano Concerto and the Violin Sonata.
Ravel placed high importance on melody, telling Vaughan Williams that there is &quot;an implied melodic outline in all vital music&quot;. His themes are frequently modal, eschewing the familiar major or minor scales. Chords of the ninth and eleventh and unresolved appoggiaturas, such as those in the &quot;Valses nobles et sentimentales&quot;, are characteristic of Ravel&#x27;s harmonic language.

Dance forms appealed to Ravel, most famously the bolero and pavane, but also the minuet, forlane, rigaudon, waltz, czardas, habanera and passacaglia. National and regional consciousness was important to him, and although a planned concerto on Basque themes never materialised, his works include allusions to Hebraic, Greek, Hungarian and gypsy themes. He wrote several short pieces paying tribute to composers he admired – Borodin, Chabrier, Fauré and Haydn, interpreting their characteristics in a Ravellian style. Another important influence was literary rather than musical: Ravel said that he learnt from Poe that &quot;true art is a perfect balance between pure intellect and emotion&quot;, with the corollary that a piece of music should be a perfectly balanced entity with no irrelevant material allowed to intrude.

===Operas===

Ravel completed two operas, and worked on three others. The unrealised three were &quot;Olympia&quot;, &quot;La cloche engloutie&quot; and &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot;. &quot;Olympia&quot; was to be based on Hoffmann&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman&quot;; he made sketches for it in 1898–99, but did not progress far. &quot;La cloche engloutie&quot; after Hauptmann&#x27;s &quot;The Sunken Bell&quot; occupied him intermittently from 1906 to 1912, Ravel destroyed the sketches for both these works, except for a &quot;Symphonie horlogère&quot; which he incorporated into the opening of &quot;L&#x27;heure espagnole&quot;. The third unrealised project was an operatic version of Joseph Delteil&#x27;s 1925 novel about Joan of Arc. It was to be a large-scale, full-length work for the Paris Opéra, but Ravel&#x27;s final illness prevented him from writing it.

Ravel&#x27;s first completed opera was &quot;L&#x27;heure espagnole&quot; (premiered in 1911), described as a &quot;comédie musicale&quot;. It is among the works set in or illustrating Spain that Ravel wrote throughout his career. Nichols comments that the essential Spanish colouring gave Ravel a reason for virtuoso use of the modern orchestra, which the composer considered &quot;perfectly designed for underlining and exaggerating comic effects&quot;. Edward Burlingame Hill found Ravel&#x27;s vocal writing particularly skilful in the work, &quot;giving the singers something besides recitative without hampering the action&quot;, and &quot;commenting orchestrally upon the dramatic situations and the sentiments of the actors without diverting attention from the stage&quot;. Some find the characters artificial and the piece lacking in humanity. The critic David Murray writes that the score &quot;glows with the famous Ravel &quot;tendresse&quot;.&quot;

The second opera, also in one act, is &quot;L&#x27;enfant et les sortilèges&quot; (1926), a &quot;fantaisie lyrique&quot; to a libretto by Colette. She and Ravel had planned the story as a ballet, but at the composer&#x27;s suggestion Colette turned it into an opera libretto. It is more uncompromisingly modern in its musical style than &quot;L&#x27;heure espagnole&quot;, and the jazz elements and bitonality of much of the work upset many Parisian opera-goers. Ravel was once again accused of artificiality and lack of human emotion, but Nichols finds &quot;profoundly serious feeling at the heart of this vivid and entertaining work&quot;. The score presents an impression of simplicity, disguising intricate links between themes, with, in Murray&#x27;s phrase, &quot;extraordinary and bewitching sounds from the orchestra pit throughout&quot;.

Although one-act operas are generally staged less often than full-length ones, Ravel&#x27;s are produced regularly in France and abroad.

===Other vocal works===
A substantial proportion of Ravel&#x27;s output was vocal. His early works in that sphere include cantatas written for his unsuccessful attempts at the Prix de Rome. His other vocal music from that period shows Debussy&#x27;s influence, in what Kelly describes as &quot;a static, recitative-like vocal style&quot;, prominent piano parts and rhythmic flexibility. By 1906 Ravel was taking even further than Debussy the natural, sometimes colloquial, setting of the French language in &quot;Histoires naturelles&quot;. The same technique is highlighted in &quot;Trois poèmes de Mallarmé&quot; (1913); Debussy set two of the three poems at the same time as Ravel, and the former&#x27;s word-setting is noticeably more formal than the latter&#x27;s, in which syllables are often elided. In the cycles &quot;Shéhérazade&quot; and &quot;Chansons madécasses&quot;, Ravel gives vent to his taste for the exotic, even the sensual, in both the vocal line and the accompaniment.

Ravel&#x27;s songs often draw on vernacular styles, using elements of many folk traditions in such works as &quot;Cinq mélodies populaires grecques&quot;, &quot;Deux mélodies hébraïques&quot; and &quot;Chants populaires&quot;. Among the poets on whose lyrics he drew were Marot, Léon-Paul Fargue, Leconte de Lisle and Verlaine. For three songs dating from 1914 to 1915, he wrote his own texts.

Although Ravel wrote for mixed choirs and male solo voices, he is chiefly associated, in his songs, with the soprano and mezzo-soprano voices. Even when setting lyrics clearly narrated by a man, he often favoured a female voice, and he seems to have preferred his best-known cycle, &quot;Shéhérazade&quot;, to be sung by a woman, although a tenor voice is a permitted alternative in the score.

===Orchestral works===
During his lifetime it was above all as a master of orchestration that Ravel was famous. He minutely studied the ability of each orchestral instrument to determine its potential, putting its individual colour and timbre to maximum use. The critic Alexis Roland-Manuel wrote, &quot;In reality he is, with Stravinsky, the one man in the world who best knows the weight of a trombone-note, the harmonics of a &#x27;cello or a &quot;pp&quot; tam-tam in the relationships of one orchestral group to another.&quot;
For all Ravel&#x27;s orchestral mastery, only four of his works were conceived as concert works for symphony orchestra: &quot;Rapsodie espagnole&quot;, &quot;La valse&quot; and the two concertos. All the other orchestral works were written either for the stage, as in &quot;Daphnis et Chloé&quot;, or as a reworking of piano pieces, &quot;Alborada del gracioso&quot; and &quot;Une barque sur l&#x27;ocean&quot;, (&quot;Miroirs&quot;), &quot;Valses nobles et sentimentales,&quot; &quot;Ma mère l&#x27;Oye&quot;, &quot;Tzigane&quot; (originally for violin and piano) and &quot;Le tombeau de Couperin.&quot; In the orchestral versions, the instrumentation generally clarifies the harmonic language of the score and brings sharpness to classical dance rhythms. Occasionally, as in the &quot;Alborada del gracioso&quot;, critics have found the later orchestral version less persuasive than the sharp-edged piano original.

In some of his scores from the 1920s, including &quot;Daphnis et Chloé&quot;, Ravel frequently divides his upper strings, having them play in six to eight parts while the woodwind are required to play with extreme agility. His writing for the brass ranges from softly muted to triple-forte outbursts at climactic points. In the 1930s he tended to simplify his orchestral textures. The lighter tone of the G major Piano Concerto follows the models of Mozart and Saint-Saëns, alongside use of jazz-like themes. The critics Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor comment that in the slow movement, &quot;one of the most beautiful tunes Ravel ever invented&quot;, the composer &quot;can truly be said to join hands with Mozart&quot;. The most popular of Ravel&#x27;s orchestral works, &quot;Boléro&quot; (1928), was conceived several years before its completion; in 1924 he said that he was contemplating &quot;a symphonic poem without a subject, where the whole interest will be in the rhythm&quot;.

Ravel made orchestral versions of piano works by Schumann, Chabrier, Debussy and Mussorgsky&#x27;s piano suite &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;. Orchestral versions of the last by Mikhail Tushmalov, Sir Henry Wood and Leo Funtek predated Ravel&#x27;s 1922 version, and many more have been made since, but Ravel&#x27;s remains the best known. Kelly remarks on its &quot;dazzling array of instrumental colour&quot;, and a contemporary reviewer commented on how, in dealing with another composer&#x27;s music, Ravel had produced an orchestral sound wholly unlike his own.

===Piano music===
Although Ravel wrote fewer than thirty works for the piano, they exemplify his range; Orenstein remarks that the composer keeps his personal touch &quot;from the striking simplicity of &quot;Ma mère l&#x27;Oye&quot; to the transcendental virtuosity of &quot;Gaspard de la nuit&quot;&quot;. Ravel&#x27;s earliest major work for piano, &quot;Jeux d&#x27;eau&quot; (1901), is frequently cited as evidence that he evolved his style independently of Debussy, whose major works for piano all came later. When writing for solo piano, Ravel rarely aimed at the intimate chamber effect characteristic of Debussy, but sought a Lisztian virtuosity. The authors of &quot;The Record Guide&quot; consider that works such as &quot;Gaspard de la Nuit&quot; and &quot;Miroirs&quot; have a beauty and originality with a deeper inspiration &quot;in the harmonic and melodic genius of Ravel himself&quot;.
Most of Ravel&#x27;s piano music is extremely difficult to play, and presents pianists with a balance of technical and artistic challenges. Writing of the piano music the critic Andrew Clark commented in 2013, &quot;A successful Ravel interpretation is a finely balanced thing. It involves subtle musicianship, a feeling for pianistic colour and the sort of lightly worn virtuosity that masks the advanced technical challenges he makes in &quot;Alborada del gracioso&quot;... and the two outer movements of &quot;Gaspard de la nuit&quot;. Too much temperament, and the music loses its classical shape; too little, and it sounds pale.&quot; This balance caused a breach between the composer and Viñes, who said that if he observed the nuances and speeds Ravel stipulated in &quot;Gaspard de la nuit&quot;, &quot;Le gibet&quot; would &quot;bore the audience to death&quot;. Some pianists continue to attract criticism for over-interpreting Ravel&#x27;s piano writing.

Ravel&#x27;s regard for his predecessors is heard in several of his piano works; &quot;Menuet sur le nom de Haydn&quot; (1909), &quot;À la manière de Borodine&quot; (1912), &quot;À la manière de Chabrier&quot; (1913) and &quot;Le tombeau de Couperin&quot; all incorporate elements of the named composers interpreted in a characteristically Ravellian manner. Clark comments that those piano works which Ravel later orchestrated are overshadowed by the revised versions: &quot;Listen to &quot;Le tombeau de Couperin&quot; and the complete ballet music for &quot;Ma mère L&#x27;Oye&quot; in the classic recordings conducted by André Cluytens, and the piano versions never sound quite the same again.&quot;

===Chamber music===
Apart from a one-movement Sonata for Violin and Piano dating from 1899, unpublished in the composer&#x27;s lifetime, Ravel wrote seven chamber works. The earliest is the String Quartet (1902–03), dedicated to Fauré, and showing the influence of Debussy&#x27;s quartet of ten years earlier. Like the Debussy, it differs from the more monumental quartets of the established French school of Franck and his followers, with more succinct melodies, fluently interchanged, in flexible tempos and varieties of instrumental colour. The Introduction and Allegro for harp, flute, clarinet and string quartet (1905) was composed very quickly by Ravel&#x27;s standards. It is an ethereal piece in the vein of the &quot;Pavane pour une infante défunte&quot;. Ravel also worked at unusual speed on the Piano Trio (1914) to complete it before joining the French Army. It contains Basque, Baroque and far Eastern influences, and shows Ravel&#x27;s growing technical skill, dealing with the difficulties of balancing the percussive piano with the sustained sound of the violin and cello, &quot;blending the two disparate elements in a musical language that is unmistakably his own,&quot; in the words of the commentator Keith Anderson.

Ravel&#x27;s four chamber works composed after the First World War are the Sonata for Violin and Cello (1920–22), the &quot;Berceuse sur le nom de Gabriel Fauré&quot; for violin and piano (1922), the chamber original of &quot;Tzigane&quot; for violin and piano (1924) and finally the Violin Sonata (1923–27). The two middle works are respectively an affectionate tribute to Ravel&#x27;s teacher, and a virtuoso display piece for the violinist Jelly d&#x27;Arányi. The Violin and Cello Sonata is a departure from the rich textures and harmonies of the pre-war Piano Trio: the composer said that it marked a turning point in his career, with thinness of texture pushed to the extreme and harmonic charm renounced in favour of pure melody. His last chamber work, the Violin Sonata (sometimes called the Second after the posthumous publication of his student sonata), is a frequently dissonant work. Ravel said that the violin and piano are &quot;essentially incompatible&quot; instruments, and that his Sonata reveals their incompatibility. Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor consider the post-war sonatas &quot;rather laboured and unsatisfactory&quot;, and neither work has matched the popularity of Ravel&#x27;s pre-war chamber works.

===Recordings===
Ravel&#x27;s interpretations of some of his piano works were captured on piano roll between 1914 and 1928, although some rolls supposedly played by him may have been made under his supervision by Robert Casadesus, a better pianist. Transfers of the rolls have been released on compact disc. In 1913 there was a gramophone recording of &quot;Jeux d&#x27;eau&quot; played by Mark Hambourg, and by the early 1920s there were discs featuring the &quot;Pavane pour une infante défunte&quot; and &quot;Ondine&quot;, and movements from the String Quartet, &quot;Le tombeau de Couperin&quot; and &quot;Ma mère l&#x27;Oye&quot;. Ravel was among the first composers who recognised the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public, and throughout the 1920s there was a steady stream of recordings of his works, some of which featured the composer as pianist or conductor. A 1932 recording of the G major Piano Concerto was advertised as &quot;Conducted by the composer&quot;, although he had in fact supervised the sessions while a more proficient conductor took the baton. Recordings for which Ravel actually was the conductor included a &quot;Boléro&quot; in 1930, and a sound film of a 1933 performance of the D major concerto with Wittgenstein as soloist.

==Honours and legacy==
Ravel declined not only the Légion d&#x27;honneur, but all state honours from France, refusing to let his name go forward for election to the Institut de France. He accepted foreign awards, including honorary membership of the Royal Philharmonic Society in 1921, the Belgian Ordre de Léopold in 1926, and an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford in 1928.

After Ravel&#x27;s death, his brother and legatee, Edouard, turned the composer&#x27;s house at Montfort-l&#x27;Amaury into a museum, leaving it substantially as Ravel had known it. As at 2023 the maison-musée de Maurice Ravel remains open for guided tours.

In his later years, Edouard Ravel declared his intention to leave the bulk of the composer&#x27;s estate to the city of Paris for the endowment of a Nobel Prize in music, but evidently changed his mind. After his death in 1960, the estate passed through several hands. Despite the substantial royalties paid for performing Ravel&#x27;s music, the news magazine &quot;Le Point&quot; reported in 2000 that it was unclear who the beneficiaries were. The British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported in 2001 that no money from royalties had been forthcoming for the maintenance of the Ravel museum at Montfort-l&#x27;Amaury, which was in a poor state of repair.

Many works have been dedicated to Ravel or composed in his memory, by Satie, Stravinsky and others.

<text>Goldie Jeanne Hawn (born November 21, 1945) is an American actress. She rose to fame on the NBC sketch comedy program &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; (1968–1970), before going on to receive the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in &quot;Cactus Flower&quot; (1969).

Hawn appeared in such films as &quot;There&#x27;s a Girl in My Soup&quot; (1970), &quot;Butterflies Are Free&quot; (1972), &quot;The Sugarland Express&quot; (1974), &quot;Shampoo&quot; (1975), &quot;Foul Play&quot; (1978), &quot;Seems Like Old Times&quot; (1980), and &quot;Private Benjamin&quot; (1980), for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for playing the title role. She later starred in &quot;Overboard&quot; (1987), &quot;Bird on a Wire&quot; (1990), &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; (1992), &quot;Housesitter&quot; (1992), &quot;The First Wives Club&quot; (1996), &quot;The Out-of-Towners&quot; (1999), and &quot;The Banger Sisters&quot; (2002). Hawn made her return to film with roles in &quot;Snatched&quot; (2017), &quot;The Christmas Chronicles&quot; (2018), and &quot;The Christmas Chronicles 2&quot; (2020).

Hawn is the mother of actors Oliver Hudson, Kate Hudson, and Wyatt Russell. She has been in a relationship with Kurt Russell since 1983. In 2003, she founded the Hawn Foundation, which educates underprivileged children.

==Early life==
Hawn was born in Washington, D.C. to Laura (née Steinhoff), a jewellery shop/dance school owner, and Edward Rutledge Hawn, a musician and conductor who was a descendent of Edward Rutledge, the youngest signatory of the Declaration of Independence. She was named after her mother&#x27;s aunt. She has one sister, entertainment publicist Patti Hawn; their brother, Edward Jr., died in infancy before Patti was conceived. The girls were unaware of their deceased brother&#x27;s existence growing up.

Her father was a Presbyterian of German and English descent. Her mother was Jewish, the daughter of Jewish immigrants from Hungary. Hawn was raised Jewish in Takoma Park, Maryland, and attended Montgomery Blair High School in nearby Silver Spring, Maryland.

Hawn began taking ballet and tap dance lessons at the age of three and danced in the corps de ballet of the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo production of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; in 1955. She made her stage debut in 1964, playing Juliet in a Virginia Shakespeare Festival production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

In 1964, Hawn ran and taught in a ballet school, having dropped out of American University where she was majoring in drama. She made her professional dancing debut in a production of &quot;Can-Can&quot; at the Texas Pavilion of the New York World&#x27;s Fair. She began working as a professional dancer a year later and appeared as a go-go dancer in New York City and at the Peppermint Box in New Jersey.

==Career==
===1960s===

Hawn moved to California to dance in a show at Melodyland Theatre, a theater in the round across from Disneyland, joining the chorus of &quot;Pal Joey&quot; and &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot; during the June 14 to September 1966 season. Hawn began her acting career as a cast member of the short-lived sitcom &quot;Good Morning World&quot; during the 1967–1968 television season, her role being that of the girlfriend of a radio disc jockey, with a stereotypical &quot;dumb blonde&quot; personality.

Her next role, which brought her to international attention, was also as a dumb blonde, as one of the regular cast members on the 1968–1973 sketch comedy show &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;. Hawn often broke out into high-pitched giggles in the middle of a joke, then delivered a polished performance a moment after. Noted equally for her chipper attitude as for her bikini-attired and painted body, Hawn was seen as a 1960s &quot;It&quot; girl.

Her &quot;Laugh-In&quot; persona was parlayed into three popular film appearances in the late 1960s and early 1970s: &quot;Cactus Flower&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;s a Girl in My Soup&quot;, and &quot;Butterflies Are Free&quot;. Hawn made her film debut in a bit role as a giggling dancer in the 1968 film &quot;The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band&quot;, in which she was billed as &quot;Goldie Jeanne&quot;, but in her first major film role, in &quot;Cactus Flower&quot; (1969), she won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress as Walter Matthau&#x27;s suicidal fiancée. The same year, she appeared in &quot;The Spring Thing&quot;, a television special hosted by Bobbie Gentry and Noel Harrison. Other guests were Meredith MacRae, Irwin C. Watson, Rod McKuen, Shirley Bassey and Harpers Bizarre.

===1970s===

After Hawn&#x27;s Academy Award win, her film career took off. She starred in a string of successful comedies starting with &quot;There&#x27;s a Girl in My Soup&quot; (1970), &quot;$&quot; (1971), and &quot;Butterflies Are Free&quot; (1972). She continued proving herself in the dramatic league in 1974 with the satirical dramas &quot;The Girl from Petrovka&quot; and Steven Spielberg&#x27;s theatrical debut &quot;The Sugarland Express&quot;. She then co-starred in Hal Ashby&#x27;s classic satire &quot;Shampoo&quot; (1975). She also hosted two television specials: &quot;Pure Goldie&quot; in 1971 and &quot;The Goldie Hawn Special&quot; in 1978. The latter was a sort of comeback for Hawn, who had been out of the spotlight for two years since the 1976 release of the romantic comedy western &quot;The Duchess and the Dirtwater Fox&quot;, while she was focusing on her marriage and the birth of her son.

On the special she performed show tunes and comedy bits alongside comic legend George Burns, teen matinee idol Shaun Cassidy, television star John Ritter (during his days on &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;), and even the Harlem Globetrotters joined her for a montage. The special later went on to be nominated for a primetime Emmy. Four months later the film &quot;Foul Play&quot; (with Chevy Chase), was released and became a box office smash, reviving Hawn&#x27;s film career. The plot centered around an innocent woman in San Francisco who becomes mixed up in an assassination plot. Hawn&#x27;s next film, Mario Monicelli&#x27;s &quot;Lovers and Liars&quot; (1979), was a box office bomb.

In 1972, Hawn recorded and released a solo country LP for Warner Brothers, titled &quot;Goldie&quot;. It was recorded with the help of Dolly Parton and Buck Owens. AllMusic gives the album a favorable review, calling it a &quot;sweetly endearing country-tinged middle of the road pop record&quot;.

===1980s===

Hawn&#x27;s popularity continued into the 1980s, starting with another primetime variety special alongside actress and singer Liza Minnelli, &quot;Goldie and Liza Together&quot; (1980), which was nominated for four Emmy Awards. In the same year, Hawn took the lead role in &quot;Private Benjamin&quot;, a comedy she co-produced with her friend Nancy Meyers, who co-wrote the script. Meyers recalls Hawn&#x27;s reaction when she first described the idea for the story with Hawn as its lead:

&quot;Private Benjamin&quot; also stars Eileen Brennan and Armand Assante and garnered Hawn her second Academy Award nomination, this time for Best Actress. Hawn&#x27;s box office success continued with comedies like &quot;Seems Like Old Times&quot; (1980), written by Neil Simon; &quot;Best Friends&quot; (1982), written by Valerie Curtin and Barry Levinson; &quot;Protocol&quot; (1984), co-written by Nancy Meyers; &quot;Wildcats&quot; (1986)—Hawn also served as executive producer on the latter two; and the World War II romantic drama &quot;Swing Shift&quot; (1984).

At the age of thirty-nine, Hawn posed for the cover of &quot;Playboy&quot; January 1985 issue and was the subject of the Playboy Interview. Her last film of the 1980s was opposite partner Kurt Russell, for the third time, in the comedy &quot;Overboard&quot; (1987).
===1990s===
In 1990, she starred in the action comedy &quot;Bird on a Wire&quot;, a critically panned but commercially successful film that paired Hawn with Mel Gibson. Hawn had mixed success in the early 1990s, with the thriller &quot;Deceived&quot; (1991), the drama &quot;CrissCross&quot;, and opposite Bruce Willis and Meryl Streep in &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; (both 1992). Earlier that year, she starred in &quot;Housesitter&quot;, a screwball comedy with Steve Martin, which was a commercial success.

Hawn was absent from the screen for four years while caring for her mother, who died of cancer in 1994. Hawn made her entry back into film as producer of the satirical comedy &quot;Something to Talk About&quot; starring Julia Roberts and Dennis Quaid and made her directorial debut in the television film &quot;Hope&quot; (1997) starring Christine Lahti and Jena Malone.
Hawn returned to the screen again in 1996 as the aging, alcoholic actress Elise Elliot in the financially and critically successful &quot;The First Wives Club&quot;, opposite Bette Midler and Diane Keaton, with whom she covered the Lesley Gore hit &quot;You Don&#x27;t Own Me&quot; for the film&#x27;s soundtrack. Hawn also performed a cover version of the Beatles&#x27; song, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, on George Martin&#x27;s 1998 album, &quot;In My Life&quot;.

She starred in Woody Allen&#x27;s musical &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot; (1996) and reunited with Steve Martin for the comedy &quot;The Out-of-Towners&quot; (1999), a remake of the 1970 Neil Simon hit. The film was critically panned and was a box office failure. In 1997, Hawn, along with her co-stars from &quot;The First Wives Club&quot;, Diane Keaton and Bette Midler, received the Women in Film Crystal Awards.

In 1999, she was awarded Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year.

===2000s===
In 2001, Hawn was reunited with former co-stars Warren Beatty (her co-star in &quot;$&quot; and &quot;Shampoo&quot;) and Diane Keaton for the comedy &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot;, a critical and financial fiasco. Budgeted at an estimated US$90 million, the film opened to little notice and grossed only $7 million in its North American theatrical release. In 2002, she starred in &quot;The Banger Sisters&quot;, opposite Susan Sarandon and Geoffrey Rush, her last live action film for fifteen years. In 2005 Hawn&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;A Lotus Grows in the Mud&quot;, was published.
===2010s===
In 2013, Hawn guest-starred, along with Gordon Ramsay, in an episode of &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;, in which she provided the voice of neighbor Peggy McGee. In 2017, Hawn returned to the big screen for the first time since 2002, co-starring with Amy Schumer in the comedy &quot;Snatched&quot;, playing mother and daughter. In 2018, Hawn cameoed as Mrs. Claus in the Netflix film &quot;The Christmas Chronicles&quot;. She played Mrs. Claus again, in a leading role, in its 2020 sequel &quot;The Christmas Chronicles 2.&quot;

==Personal life==
Hawn has studied meditation. In a 2012 interview, she stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t think of myself as a Buddhist. I was born Jewish, and I consider that my religion.&quot; She also stated, &quot;It&#x27;s not the idea of a particular religion that&#x27;s important; it&#x27;s the development of a spiritual life.&quot;

Hawn is a supporter of the LGBT community. Speaking on nations such as Nigeria and others which have criminalized gay people, she denounced these laws, stating, &quot;This is man&#x27;s inhumanity to man, of the first order.&quot;

===Marriages and relationships===
Hawn&#x27;s pre-fame boyfriends included actor Mark Goddard and singer Spiro Venduras. Her first husband was dancer (later director) Gus Trikonis, who appeared as a Shark in &quot;West Side Story&quot;. They married on May 16, 1969, in Honolulu and separated on April 9, 1973. Hawn then dated stuntman Ted Grossman, Swedish actor Bruno Wintzell and Italian actor Franco Nero, but did not file for divorce from Trikonis until New Year&#x27;s Eve 1975, after becoming engaged to musician Bill Hudson of the Hudson Brothers, whom she&#x27;d met the previous summer on a first-class flight from New York to Los Angeles. Hawn was granted a divorce in June 1976 and married Hudson on July 3 in Takoma Park, Maryland. They had two children, son Oliver (born September 7, 1976) and daughter Kate (born April 19, 1979). Hudson filed for divorce on August 15, 1980. Hawn subsequently had romances with French actor Yves Rénier and Moroccan businessman Victor Drai. The divorce from Hudson was finalized in March 1982.

Hawn has been in a relationship with Kurt Russell since Valentine&#x27;s Day 1983. The couple first met while filming &quot;The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band&quot; in 1967, but became involved after reconnecting on the set of &quot;Swing Shift&quot;. They have a son together, Wyatt (born July 10, 1986). In 2000 and again in 2004, news outlets reported that Hawn and Russell were on the verge of breaking up. During the alleged separations, Hawn was linked to newsman Charles Glass and Pakistani former cricketer and former Prime Minister, Imran Khan. Hawn and Russell, who celebrated 40 years together in 2023, own homes in Vancouver, Snowmass, Manhattan, Santa Ynez Valley, Brentwood; and Palm Desert. Hawn has revealed that she has no plans to marry Russell, stating that she &quot;would have been long divorced if [she&#x27;d] been married,&quot; and that she and Russell chose to stay together and they do not feel that marriage &quot;cements&quot; a relationship.

===The Hawn Foundation===
In 2003, Hawn founded the Hawn Foundation, a non-profit organization which provides youth education programs intended to improve academic performance through &quot;life-enhancing strategies for well-being&quot;. The Hawn Foundation has supported research studies conducted by external researchers to evaluate the effectiveness of its educational program for children, called MindUP.

<text>Essentialism is the view that objects have a set of attributes that are necessary to their identity. In early Western thought, Platonic idealism held that all things have such an &quot;essence&quot;—an &quot;idea&quot; or &quot;form&quot;. In &quot;Categories&quot;, Aristotle similarly proposed that all objects have a substance that, as George Lakoff put it, &quot;make the thing what it is, and without which it would be not &quot;that&quot; kind of thing&quot;. The contrary view—non-essentialism—denies the need to posit such an &quot;essence&quot;. Essentialism has been controversial from its beginning. In the &quot;Parmenides&quot; dialogue, Plato depicts Socrates questioning the notion, suggesting that if we accept the idea that every beautiful thing or just action partakes of an essence to be beautiful or just, we must also accept the &quot;existence of separate essences for hair, mud, and dirt&quot;.

Older social theories were often conceptually essentialist. In biology and other natural sciences, essentialism provided the rationale for taxonomy at least until the time of Charles Darwin. The role and importance of essentialism in modern biology is still a matter of debate. Beliefs which posit that social identities such as race, ethnicity, nationality, or gender are essential characteristics have been central to many discriminatory or extremist ideologies. For instance, psychological essentialism is correlated with racial prejudice. Essentialist views about race have also been shown to diminish empathy when dealing with members of another racial group. In medical sciences, essentialism can lead to a reified view of identities, leading to fallacious conclusions and potentially unequal treatment.

==In philosophy==
An &quot;essence&quot; characterizes a substance or a form, in the sense of the forms and ideas in Platonic idealism. It is permanent, unalterable, and eternal, and is present in every possible world. Classical humanism has an essentialist conception of the human, in its endorsement of the notion of an eternal and unchangeable human nature. This has been criticized by Kierkegaard, Marx, Heidegger, Sartre, Badiou and many other existential, materialist and anti-humanist thinkers. Essentialism, in its broadest sense, is any philosophy that acknowledges the primacy of &quot;essence&quot;. Unlike existentialism, which posits &quot;being&quot; as the fundamental reality, the essentialist must be approached from a metaphysical perspective. Empirical knowledge is developed from experience of a relational universe whose components and attributes are defined and measured in terms of intellectually constructed laws. Thus, for the scientist, reality is explored as an evolutionary system of diverse entities, the order of which is determined by the principle of causality.

In Plato&#x27;s philosophy, in particular the &quot;Timaeus&quot; and the &quot;Philebus&quot;, things were said to come into being by the action of a demiurge who works to form chaos into ordered entities. Many definitions of &quot;essence&quot; hark back to the ancient Greek hylomorphic understanding of the formation of the things. According to that account, the structure and real existence of any thing can be understood by analogy to an artefact produced by a craftsperson. The craftsperson requires &quot;hyle&quot; (timber or wood) and a model, plan or idea in their own mind, according to which the wood is worked to give it the indicated contour or form (&quot;morphe&quot;). Aristotle was the first to use the terms &quot;hyle&quot; and &quot;morphe&quot;. According to his explanation, all entities have two aspects: &quot;matter&quot; and &quot;form&quot;. It is the particular form imposed that gives some matter its identity—its quiddity or &quot;whatness&quot; (i.e., &quot;what it is&quot;). Plato was one of the first essentialists, postulating the concept of ideal forms—an abstract entity of which individual objects are mere facsimiles. To give an example: the ideal form of a circle is a perfect circle, something that is physically impossible to make manifest; yet the circles we draw and observe clearly have some &quot;idea&quot; in common—the ideal form. Plato proposed that these ideas are eternal and vastly superior to their manifestations, and that we understand these manifestations in the material world by comparing and relating them to their respective ideal form. Plato&#x27;s forms are regarded as patriarchs to essentialist dogma simply because they are a case of what is intrinsic and a-contextual of objects—the abstract properties that make them what they are. One example is Plato&#x27;s parable of the cave. Plato believed that the universe was perfect and that its observed imperfections came from man&#x27;s limited perception of it. For Plato, there were two realities: the &quot;essential&quot; or ideal and the &quot;perceived&quot;.

Aristotle (384–322 BC) applied the term &quot;essence&quot; to that which things in a category have in common and without which they cannot be members of that category (for example, &quot;rationality&quot; is the essence of man; without rationality a creature cannot be a man). In his critique of Aristotle&#x27;s philosophy, Bertrand Russell said that his concept of essence transferred to metaphysics what was only a verbal convenience and that it confused the properties of language with the properties of the world. In fact, a thing&#x27;s &quot;essence&quot; consisted in those defining properties without which we could not use the &quot;name&quot; for it. Although the concept of essence was &quot;hopelessly muddled&quot; it became part of every philosophy until modern times. The Egyptian-born philosopher Plotinus (204–270 AD) brought idealism to the Roman Empire as Neoplatonism, and with it the concept that not only do all existents emanate from a &quot;primary essence&quot; but that the mind plays an active role in shaping or ordering the objects of perception, rather than passively receiving empirical data.

==Examples==

=== Naturalism ===
Dating back to the 18th century, naturalism is a form of essentialism in which social matters are explained through the logic of natural dispositions. The invoked nature can be biological, ontological or theological. It is opposed by antinaturalism and culturalism.

====Human nature====
In the case of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, the divergent conceptions of human nature may be partitioned into &quot;essentialist&quot; versus &quot;non-essentialist&quot; (or even &quot;anti-essentialist&quot;) positions. Another established dichotomy is that of monism versus pluralism about the matter.
===Biological essentialism===

Before evolution was developed as a scientific theory, the essentialist view of biology posited that all species are unchanging throughout time. The historian Mary P. Winsor has argued that biologists such as Louis Agassiz in the 19th century believed that taxa such as species and genus were fixed, reflecting the mind of the creator. Some religious opponents of evolution continue to maintain this view of biology. 

Work by historians of systematic biology in the 21st century has cast doubt upon this view of pre-Darwinian thinkers. Winsor, Ron Amundson and Staffan Müller-Wille have each argued that in fact the usual suspects (such as Linnaeus and the Ideal Morphologists) were very far from being essentialists, and that the so-called &quot;essentialism story&quot; (or &quot;myth&quot;) in biology is a result of conflating the views expressed and biological examples used by philosophers going back to Aristotle and continuing through to John Stuart Mill and William Whewell in the immediately pre-Darwinian period, with the way that biologists used such terms as &quot;species&quot;. 

Anti-essentialists contend that an essentialist typological categorization has been rendered obsolete and untenable by evolutionary theory for several reasons. First, they argue that biological species are dynamic entities, emerging and disappearing as distinct populations are molded by natural selection. This view contrasts with the static essences that essentialists say characterize natural categories. Second, the opponents of essentialism argue that our current understanding of biological species emphasizes genealogical relationships rather than &quot;intrinsic&quot; traits. Lastly, non-essentialists assert that every organism has a mutational load, and the variability and diversity within species contradict the notion of fixed biological natures.

===Gender essentialism===
In feminist theory and gender studies, gender essentialism is the attribution of fixed essences to men and women—this idea that men and women are fundamentally different continues to be a matter of contention. Gay/lesbian rights advocate Diana Fuss wrote: &quot;Essentialism is most commonly understood as a belief in the real, true essence of things, the invariable and fixed properties which define the &#x27;whatness&#x27; of a given entity.&quot; Women&#x27;s essence is assumed to be universal and is generally identified with those characteristics viewed as being specifically feminine. These ideas of femininity are usually biologized and are often preoccupied with psychological characteristics, such as nurturance, empathy, support, and non-competitiveness, etc. Feminist theorist Elizabeth Grosz states in her 1995 publication &quot;Space, time and perversion: essays on the politics of bodies&quot; that essentialism &quot;entails the belief that those characteristics defined as women&#x27;s essence are shared in common by all women at all times. It implies a limit of the variations and possibilities of change—it is not possible for a subject to act in a manner contrary to her essence. Her essence underlies all the apparent variations differentiating women from each other. Essentialism thus refers to the existence of fixed characteristic, given attributes, and ahistorical functions that limit the possibilities of change and thus of social reorganization.&quot;

Gender essentialism is pervasive in popular culture, as illustrated by the #1 &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller &quot;Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus&quot;, but this essentialism is routinely critiqued in introductory women&#x27;s studies textbooks such as &quot;Women: Images &amp; Realities&quot;. Starting in the 1980s, some feminist writers have put forward essentialist theories about gender and science. Evelyn Fox Keller, Sandra Harding,
 and Nancy Tuana
 argued that the modern scientific enterprise is inherently patriarchal and incompatible with women&#x27;s nature. Other feminist scholars, such as Ann Hibner Koblitz, Lenore Blum, Mary Gray, Mary Beth Ruskai, and Pnina Abir-Am and Dorinda Outram have criticized those theories for ignoring the diverse nature of scientific research and the tremendous variation in women&#x27;s experiences in different cultures and historical periods.

===Racial, cultural and strategic essentialism===

Cultural and racial essentialism is the view that fundamental biological or physical characteristics of human &quot;races&quot; produce personality, heritage, cognitive abilities, or &#x27;natural talents&#x27; that are shared by all members of a racial group. In the early 20th century, many anthropologists taught this theory – that race was an entirely biological phenomenon and that this was core to a person&#x27;s behavior and identity. This, coupled with a belief that linguistic, cultural, and social groups fundamentally existed along racial lines, formed the basis of what is now called scientific racism. After the Nazi eugenics program, along with the rise of anti-colonial movements, racial essentialism lost widespread popularity. New studies of culture and the fledgling field of population genetics undermined the scientific standing of racial essentialism, leading race anthropologists to revise their conclusions about the sources of phenotypic variation. A significant number of modern anthropologists and biologists in the West came to view race as an invalid genetic or biological designation.

Historically, beliefs which posit that social identities such as ethnicity, nationality or gender determine a person&#x27;s essential characteristics have in many cases been shown to have destructive or harmful results. It has been argued by some that essentialist thinking lies at the core of many simplistic, discriminatory or extremist ideologies. Psychological essentialism is also correlated with racial prejudice. In medical sciences, essentialism can lead to an over-emphasis on the role of identities—for example assuming that differences in hypertension in African-American populations are due to racial differences rather than social causes—leading to fallacious conclusions and potentially unequal treatment. Older social theories were often conceptually essentialist.

Strategic essentialism, a major concept in postcolonial theory, was introduced in the 1980s by the Indian literary critic and theorist Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak. It refers to a political tactic in which minority groups, nationalities, or ethnic groups mobilize on the basis of shared gendered, cultural, or political identity. While strong differences may exist between members of these groups, and among themselves they engage in continuous debates, it is sometimes advantageous for them to temporarily &quot;essentialize&quot; themselves, despite it being based on erroneous logic, and to bring forward their group identity in a simplified way to achieve certain goals, such as or antiglobalization.

===Machine Learning===

Pelillo argues that traditional machine learning techniques often align with an essentialist paradigm by relying on features - properties assumed to be essential for classification tasks. For instance, pattern recognition, which attempts to extract essential attributes from data, is described as inherently essentialist since it presupposes that objects have stable, identifiable essences that define their categories. This perspective extends to similarity-based approaches, which use prototype theory to establish relationships within data by grouping instances around central prototypes that exhibit the &quot;essence&quot; of a category.

Expanding on this, Pelillo and Scantamburlo highlight that certain machine-learning scenarios, such as when data is highly dimensional or features are poorly defined, challenge the essentialist framework. They advocate for alternative paradigms that consider relational and contextual information instead of isolated feature analysis. This relational focus aligns with anti-essentialist stances, which view categories as dynamic and context-dependent rather than fixed.

Šekrst and Skansi build on these ideas, noting that supervised learning, by utilizing labeled datasets, reflects essentialist tendencies since it relies on predefined human-defined categories. However, they argue that this does not commit machine learning to an ontological stance on essentialism. Instead, they propose that the categories used in supervised learning are human-constructed in feature selection processes and reflect epistemological practices rather than metaphysical truths. Similarly, unsupervised learning&#x27;s clustering and similarity-based approaches often resemble prototypical reasoning but do not inherently affirm or deny essentialism, focusing instead on pragmatic task performance.

== In historiography ==
Essentialism in history as a field of study entails discerning and listing essential cultural characteristics of a particular nation or culture, in the belief that a people or culture can be understood in this way. Sometimes such essentialism leads to claims of a praiseworthy national or cultural identity, or to its opposite, the condemnation of a culture based on presumed essential characteristics. Herodotus, for example, claims that Egyptian culture is essentially feminized and possesses a &quot;softness&quot; which has made Egypt easy to conquer. To what extent Herodotus was an essentialist is a matter of debate; he is also credited with not essentializing the concept of the Athenian identity, or differences between the Greeks and the Persians that are the subject of his &quot;Histories&quot;.

Essentialism had been operative in colonialism, as well as in critiques of colonialism. Post-colonial theorists, such as Edward Said, insisted that essentialism was the &quot;defining mode&quot; of &quot;Western&quot; historiography and ethnography until the nineteenth century and even after, according to Touraj Atabaki, manifesting itself in the historiography of the Middle East and Central Asia as Eurocentrism, over-generalization, and reductionism. Into the 21st century, most historians, social scientists, and humanists reject methodologies associated with essentialism, although some have argued that certain varieties of essentialism may be useful or even necessary. Karl Popper splits the ambiguous term &quot;realism&quot; into &quot;essentialism&quot; and &quot;realism&quot;. He uses &quot;essentialism&quot; whenever he means the opposite of nominalism, and &quot;realism&quot; only as opposed to idealism. Popper himself is a realist as opposed to an idealist, but a methodological nominalist as opposed to an essentialist. For example, statements like &quot;a puppy is a young dog&quot; should be read from right to left as an answer to &quot;What shall we call a young dog&quot;, never from left to right as an answer to &quot;What is a puppy?&quot;

==In psychology==

There is a difference between metaphysical essentialism and psychological essentialism, the latter referring not to an actual claim about the world but a claim about a way of representing entities in cognition. Influential in this area is Susan Gelman, who has outlined many domains in which children and adults construe classes of entities, particularly biological entities, in essentialist terms—i.e., as if they had an immutable underlying essence which can be used to predict unobserved similarities between members of that class. This causal relationship is unidirectional; an observable feature of an entity does not define the underlying essence.

===In developmental psychology===
Essentialism has emerged as an important concept in psychology, particularly developmental psychology. In 1991, Kathryn Kremer and Susan Gelman studied the extent to which children from four–seven years old demonstrate essentialism. Children believed that underlying essences predicted observable behaviours. Children were able to describe living objects&#x27; behaviour as self-perpetuated and non-living objects&#x27; behavior as a result of an adult influencing the object. Understanding the underlying causal mechanism for behaviour suggests essentialist thinking. Younger children were unable to identify causal mechanisms of behaviour whereas older children were able to. This suggests that essentialism is rooted in cognitive development. It can be argued that there is a shift in the way that children represent entities, from not understanding the causal mechanism of the underlying essence to showing sufficient understanding.

There are four key criteria that constitute essentialist thinking. The first facet is the aforementioned individual causal mechanisms. The second is innate potential: the assumption that an object will fulfill its predetermined course of development. According to this criterion, essences predict developments in entities that will occur throughout its lifespan. The third is immutability. Despite altering the superficial appearance of an object it does not remove its essence. Observable changes in features of an entity are not salient enough to alter its essential characteristics. The fourth is inductive potential. This suggests that entities may share common features but are essentially different; however similar two beings may be, their characteristics will be at most analogous, differing most importantly in essences. The implications of psychological essentialism are numerous. Prejudiced individuals have been found to endorse exceptionally essential ways of thinking, suggesting that essentialism may perpetuate exclusion among social groups. For example, essentialism of nationality has been linked to anti-immigration attitudes. In multiple studies in India and the United States, it was shown that in lay view a person&#x27;s nationality is considerably fixed at birth, even if that person is adopted and raised by a family of another nationality at day one and never told about their origin. This may be due to an over-extension of an essential-biological mode of thinking stemming from cognitive development. Paul Bloom of Yale University has stated that &quot;one of the most exciting ideas in cognitive science is the theory that people have a default assumption that things, people and events have invisible essences that make them what they are. Experimental psychologists have argued that essentialism underlies our understanding of the physical and social worlds, and developmental and cross-cultural psychologists have proposed that it is instinctive and universal. We are natural-born essentialists.&quot; Scholars suggest that the categorical nature of essentialist thinking predicts the use of stereotypes and can be targeted in the application of stereotype prevention.

<text>In mathematics, a great circle or orthodrome is the circular intersection of a sphere and a plane passing through the sphere&#x27;s center point.

==Discussion==
Any arc of a great circle is a geodesic of the sphere, so that great circles in spherical geometry are the natural analog of straight lines in Euclidean space. For any pair of distinct non-antipodal points on the sphere, there is a unique great circle passing through both. (Every great circle through any point also passes through its antipodal point, so there are infinitely many great circles through two antipodal points.) The shorter of the two great-circle arcs between two distinct points on the sphere is called the &quot;minor arc&quot;, and is the shortest surface-path between them. Its arc length is the great-circle distance between the points (the intrinsic distance on a sphere), and is proportional to the measure of the central angle formed by the two points and the center of the sphere.

A great circle is the largest circle that can be drawn on any given sphere. Any diameter of any great circle coincides with a diameter of the sphere, and therefore every great circle is concentric with the sphere and shares the same radius. Any other circle of the sphere is called a small circle, and is the intersection of the sphere with a plane not passing through its center. Small circles are the spherical-geometry analog of circles in Euclidean space.

Every circle in Euclidean 3-space is a great circle of exactly one sphere.

The disk bounded by a great circle is called a &quot;great disk&quot;: it is the intersection of a ball and a plane passing through its center.
In higher dimensions, the great circles on the &quot;n&quot;-sphere are the intersection of the &quot;n&quot;-sphere with 2-planes that pass through the origin in the Euclidean space .

Half of a great circle may be called a &quot;great semicircle&quot; (e.g., as in parts of a meridian in astronomy).

==Derivation of shortest paths==

To prove that the minor arc of a great circle is the shortest path connecting two points on the surface of a sphere, one can apply calculus of variations to it.

Consider the class of all regular paths from a point formula_1 to another point formula_2. Introduce spherical coordinates so that formula_1 coincides with the north pole. Any curve on the sphere that does not intersect either pole, except possibly at the endpoints, can be parametrized by

:formula_4

provided formula_5 is allowed to take on arbitrary real values. The infinitesimal arc length in these coordinates is

: formula_6

So the length of a curve formula_7 from formula_1 to formula_2 is a functional of the curve given by

: formula_10

According to the Euler–Lagrange equation, formula_11 is minimized if and only if
:formula_12,
where formula_13 is a formula_14-independent constant, and
:formula_15
From the first equation of these two, it can be obtained that
:formula_16.
Integrating both sides and considering the boundary condition, the real solution of formula_13 is zero. Thus, formula_18 and formula_19 can be any value between 0 and formula_20, indicating that the curve must lie on a meridian of the sphere. In a Cartesian coordinate system, this is
:formula_21
which is a plane through the origin, i.e., the center of the sphere.

==Applications==
Some examples of great circles on the celestial sphere include the celestial horizon, the celestial equator, and the ecliptic. Great circles are also used as rather accurate approximations of geodesics on the Earth&#x27;s surface for air or sea navigation (although it is not a perfect sphere), as well as on spheroidal celestial bodies.

The equator of the idealized earth is a great circle and any meridian and its opposite meridian form a great circle. Another great circle is the one that divides the land and water hemispheres. A great circle divides the earth into two hemispheres and if a great circle passes through a point it must pass through its antipodal point.

The Funk transform integrates a function along all great circles of the sphere.

<text>Sesame Workshop (SW), originally known as the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop (CTW), is an American nonprofit organization that has been responsible for the production of several educational children&#x27;s programs—including its first and best-known, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;—that have been televised internationally. Joan Ganz Cooney and Lloyd Morrisett developed the idea to form an organization to produce the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; television series. They spent two years, from 1966 to 1968, researching, developing, and raising money for the new series. Cooney was named as the Workshop&#x27;s first executive director, which was termed &quot;one of the most important television developments of the decade.&quot;

&quot;Sesame Street&quot; premiered on National Educational Television (NET) as a series run in the United States on November 10, 1969, and moved to NET&#x27;s successor, the Public Broadcasting Service, in late 1970. The Workshop was formally incorporated in 1970. Gerald S. Lesser and Edward L. Palmer were hired to perform research for the series; they were responsible for developing a system of planning, production, and evaluation, and the interaction between television producers and educators, later termed the &quot;CTW model&quot;. The CTW applied this system to its other television series, including &quot;The Electric Company&quot; and &quot;3-2-1 Contact&quot;. The early 1980s were a challenging period for the Workshop; difficulty finding audiences for their other productions and a series of bad investments harmed the organization until licensing agreements stabilized its revenues by 1985.

Following the success of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, the CTW developed other activities, including unsuccessful ventures into adult programs, the publications of books and music, and international co-productions. In 1999 the CTW partnered with MTV Networks to create an educational channel called Noggin. They sold their stake in the channel to Viacom (owner of MTV Networks) in 2002. The Workshop produced a variety of original series for Noggin, including &quot;The Upside Down Show&quot;, &quot;Sponk!&quot; and &quot;Out There&quot;. In June 2000, the CTW changed its name to Sesame Workshop to better represent its activities beyond television. 

By 2005, income from the organization&#x27;s international co-productions of the series was $96 million. By 2008, the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; Muppets accounted for $15–17 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees. Sherrie Westin is the president of the company, starting in 2021.

== History ==

=== Background ===
During the late 1960s, 97% of all American households owned a television set, and preschool children watched an average of 27 hours of television per week. Early childhood educational research at the time had shown that when children were prepared to succeed in school, they earned better grades and learned more effectively. Children from low-income families, however, had fewer resources than children from higher-income families to prepare them for school. Research had shown that children from low-income, minority backgrounds tested &quot;substantially lower&quot; than middle-class children in school-related skills, and that they continued to have educational deficits throughout school. The topic of developmental psychology had grown during this period, and scientists were beginning to understand that changes of early childhood education could increase children&#x27;s cognitive growth.

In the winter of 1966, Joan Ganz Cooney hosted what she called &quot;a little dinner party&quot; at her apartment near Gramercy Park. Attending were her husband Tim Cooney, her boss Lewis Freedman, and Lloyd and Mary Morrisett, whom the Cooneys knew socially. Cooney was a producer of documentary films at New York public television station WNDT (now WNET), and won an Emmy for a documentary about poverty in America. Lloyd Morrisett was a vice-president at Carnegie Corporation, and was responsible for funding educational research, but had been frustrated in his efforts because they were unable to reach the large numbers of children in need of early education and intervention. Cooney was committed to using television to change society, and Morrisett was interested in using television to &quot;reach greater numbers of needy kids&quot;. The conversation during the party, which according to writer Michael Davis was the start of a five-decade long professional relationship between Cooney and Morrisett, turned to the possibilities of using television to educate young children. A week later, Cooney and Freedman met with Morrisett at the office of Carnegie Corporation to discuss doing a feasibility study for creating an educational television program for preschoolers. Cooney was chosen to perform the study.

In the summer of 1967, Cooney took a leave of absence from WNDT, and funded by Carnegie Corporation, traveled the U.S. and Canada interviewing experts in child development, education, and television. She reported her findings in a fifty-five-page document entitled &quot;The Potential Uses of Television in Preschool Education&quot;. The report described what the new series, which became &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, would be like and proposed the creation of a company that managed its production, which eventually became known as the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop (CTW).

=== Founding ===
For the next two years, Cooney and Morrisett researched and developed the new show, acquiring $8 million funding for &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, and establishing the CTW. Due to her professional experience, Cooney always assumed the show&#x27;s natural network would be PBS. Morrisett was amenable to broadcast it by commercial stations, but all three major networks rejected the idea. Davis, considering &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s licensing income years later, termed their decision &quot;a billion-dollar blunder&quot;. Morrisett was responsible for fund acquisition, and was so successful at it that writer Lee D. Mitgang later said that it &quot;defied conventional media wisdom&quot;. Cooney was responsible for the show&#x27;s creative development, and for hiring the production and research staff for the CTW. The Carnegie Corporation provided their initial $1 million grant, and Morrisett, using his contacts, procured additional multimillion-dollar grants from the U.S. federal government, the Arthur Vining Davis Foundations, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and the Ford Foundation. Morrisett&#x27;s friend Harold Howe, who was the commissioner for the U.S. Department of Education, promised $4 million, half of the new organization&#x27;s budget. The Carnegie Corporation donated an additional $1 million. Mitgang stated, &quot;Had Morrisett been any less effective in lining up financial support, Cooney&#x27;s report likely would have become just another long-forgotten foundation idea&quot;. Funds gained from a combination of government agencies and private foundations protected them from the economic problems experienced by commercial networks, but caused difficulty for procuring future funding.

Cooney&#x27;s proposal included using in-house formative research that would inform and improve production, and independent summative evaluations to test the show&#x27;s effect on its young viewers&#x27; learning. In 1967, Morrisett recruited Harvard University professor Gerald S. Lesser, whom he had met while they were both psychology students at Yale, to help develop and lead the Workshop&#x27;s research department. In 1972, the Markle Foundation donated $72,000 to Harvard to form the Center for Research in Children&#x27;s Television, which served as a research agency for the CTW. Harvard produced about 20 major research studies about &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and its effect on young children. Lesser also served as the first chairman of the Workshop&#x27;s advisory board, a position he held until his retirement in 1997. According to Lesser, the CTW&#x27;s advisory board was unusual because instead of rubber-stamping the Workshop&#x27;s decisions like most boards for other children&#x27;s television shows, it contributed significantly to the series&#x27; design and implementation. Lesser reported in &quot;Children and Television: Lessons from Sesame Street&quot;, his 1974 book about the beginnings of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop, that about 8–10% of the Workshop&#x27;s initial budget was spent on research.

CTW&#x27;s summative research was done by the Workshop&#x27;s first research director, Edward L. Palmer, whom they met at the curriculum seminars Lesser conducted in Boston in the summer of 1967. In the summer of 1968, Palmer began to create educational goals, define the Workshop&#x27;s research activities, and hire his research team. Lesser and Palmer were the only scientists in the U.S. studying the interaction of children and television at the time. They were responsible for developing a system of planning, production, and evaluation, and the interaction between television producers and educators, later called the &quot;CTW model&quot;. Cooney observed of the CTW model: &quot;From the beginning, we—the planners of the project—designed the show as an experimental research project with educational advisers, researchers, and television producers collaborating as equal partners&quot;. She described the collaboration as an &quot;arranged marriage&quot;.

The CTW devoted 8% of its initial budget to outreach and publicity. In what television historian Robert W. Morrow called &quot;an extensive campaign&quot; that Lesser stated &quot;would demand at least as much ingenuity as production and research&quot;, the Workshop promoted the show with educators, the broadcast industry, and the show&#x27;s target audience, which consisted of inner-city children and their families. They hired Evelyn Payne Davis from the Urban League, whom Michael Davis called &quot;remarkable, unsinkable, and indispensable&quot;, as the Workshop&#x27;s first Vice President of Community Relations and manager of the Workshop&#x27;s Community Educational Services (CES) division. Bob Hatch was hired to publicize their new series, both before its premiere and to take advantage of the media attention concerning &quot;Sesame Street&quot; during its first year of production.

According to Davis, despite her involvement with the project&#x27;s initial research and development, Cooney&#x27;s installment as CTW&#x27;s executive director was questionable due to her lack of executive experience, untested financial management skills, and lack of experience with children&#x27;s television and education. Davis also speculated that sexism was involved, stating, &quot;Doubters also questioned whether a woman could gain the full confidence of a quorum of men from the federal government and two elite philanthropies, institutions whose wealth exceeded the gross national product of entire countries&quot;. At first, Cooney did not fight for the position. However she had the help of her husband and Morrisett, and the project&#x27;s investors soon realized they could not begin without her. She was eventually named to the post in February 1968. As one of the first female executives in American television, her appointment was termed &quot;one of the most important television developments of the decade&quot;. The formation of the Children Television Workshop was announced at a press conference at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City on 20 May 1968.

After her appointment, Cooney hired Bob Davidson as her assistant; he was responsible for making agreements with approximately 180 public television stations to broadcast the new series. She assembled a team of producers: Jon Stone was responsible for writing, casting, and format; David Connell assumed control of animation and volume production; and Samuel Gibbon served as the show&#x27;s chief liaison between the production staff and the research team. Stone, Connell, and Gibbon had worked on another children&#x27;s show, &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;, together. Cooney later said about &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s original team of producers, &quot;collectively, we were a genius&quot;. CTW&#x27;s first children&#x27;s show, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, premiered on 10 November 1969. The CTW was not incorporated until 1970 because its creators wanted to see if the series was a success before they hired lawyers and accountants. Morrisett served as the first chairperson of CTW&#x27;s board of trustees, a job he had for 28 years.

=== Early years ===
During the second season of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, to capitalize on the momentum the Workshop was enjoying and the attention it received from the press, the Workshop created its second series, &quot;The Electric Company&quot;, in 1971. Morrisett used the same fund-acquisition techniques as he had used for &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. &quot;The Electric Company&quot; stopped production in 1977, but continued in reruns until 1985; it eventually became one of the most widely used TV shows in American classrooms and was revived in 2009. Starting in the early 1970s, the Workshop ventured into adult programming, but found that it was difficult to make their programs accessible to all socio-economic groups. In 1971, it produced a medical program for adults termed &quot;Feelin&#x27; Good&quot;, hosted by Dick Cavett, which was broadcast until 1974. According to writer Cary O&#x27;Dell, the show &quot;lacked a clear direction and never found a large audience&quot;. In 1977, the Workshop broadcast an adult drama called &quot;Best of Families&quot;, which was set in New York City around the turn of the 20th century. However, it lasted for only six or seven episodes and helped the Workshop decide to emphasize children&#x27;s programs only.
Throughout the 1970s, the CTW&#x27;s main non-television efforts changed from promotion to the development of educational materials for preschool settings. Early efforts included mobile viewing units that broadcast the show in the inner cities, in Appalachia, in Native American communities, and in migrant worker camps. In the early 1980s, the CTW created the Preschool Education Program (PEP), whose goal was to assist preschools, by combining television viewing, books, hands-on activities, and other media, in using the series as an educational resource. The Workshop also provided materials to non-English speaking children and adults. Starting in 2006, the Workshop expanded its programs by creating a series of PBS specials and DVDs largely concerning how military deployment affects the families of soldiers. Other efforts by the Workshop concerned families of prisoners, health and wellness, and safety.

According to Cooney and O&#x27;Dell, the 1980s were a problematic period for the Workshop. A series of poor investments in video games, motion picture production, theme parks, and other business ventures hurt the organization financially. Cooney brought in Bill Whaley during the late 1970s to work on their licensing agreements, but he was unable to compensate for the CTW&#x27;s losses until 1986, when licensing revenues stabilized and its portfolio investments increased. Despite financial troubles, the Workshop continued to produce new shows throughout the decade. &quot;3-2-1 Contact&quot; premiered in 1980 and ran for seven seasons. The CTW found that finding funding for this series and other science-oriented series like &quot;Square One Television&quot;, which was broadcast from 1987 to 1992, was easy because the National Science Foundation and other foundations were interested in funding science education.

=== Later years ===
Cooney stepped down as chairman and chief executive officer of the CTW in 1990, when she was replaced by David Britt, who was her &quot;chief lieutenant in the executive ranks through the mid-1990s&quot; and whom Cooney termed her &quot;right-hand for many years&quot;. Britt had worked for her at the CTW since 1975 and had served as its president and chief operating officer since 1988. At that time, Cooney became chairman of the Workshop&#x27;s executive board, which managed its businesses and licensing, and became more involved with the organization&#x27;s creative efforts. The Workshop had a reorganization in 1995, and dismissed about 12 percent of its staff. In 1998, for the first time in the series&#x27; history, they accepted funds from corporations for &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and its other programs, a policy criticized by consumer advocate Ralph Nader. The Workshop defended the acceptance of corporate sponsorship, stating that it compensated for a decrease of government subsidies.

Also in 1998, the CTW invested $25 million in an educational cable channel called Noggin. Noggin was a joint venture between the CTW and Viacom&#x27;s MTV Networks, and launched on February 2, 1999. Gary Knell explained that creating a new channel allowed the CTW to more easily &quot;ensure that our programming gets out there.&quot; While the Workshop would eventually produce various new shows for Noggin, the channel&#x27;s early lineup consisted mostly of older shows from the CTW&#x27;s library.

In 2000, profits earned from the Noggin deal, along with the revenue caused partly by the &quot;Tickle Me Elmo&quot; craze, enabled the CTW to purchase The Jim Henson Company&#x27;s rights to the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; Muppets from the German media company EM.TV, which had acquired Henson earlier that year. The transaction, valued at $180 million, also included a small interest Henson had in the Noggin cable channel. Gary Knell stated, &quot;Everyone, most especially the puppeteers, were thrilled that we were able to bring them home. It protected &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and allowed our international expansion to continue. Owning these characters has allowed us to maximize their potential. We are now in control of our own destiny&quot;.

The CTW changed its name to Sesame Workshop in June 2000, to better represent its non-television activities and interactive media. Also in 2000, Gary Knell succeeded Britt as president and CEO of the Workshop; according to Davis, he &quot;presided over an especially fertile period in the nonprofit&#x27;s history&quot;. Under Knell&#x27;s management, Sesame Workshop produced a variety of original shows for Noggin. The first was an interactive game show called &quot;Sponk!&quot;, which was meant to model good collaboration and teamwork skills. Sesame Workshop also co-produced a &quot;Sesame Street&quot; spin-off, &quot;Play with Me Sesame&quot;, for Noggin. In April 2002, Noggin premiered an overnight block for teenagers called The N. Sesame Workshop created its first-ever teen drama series, &quot;Out There&quot;, for The N.

In August 2002, Sesame Workshop sold its 50% share of Noggin to Viacom. The buyout was partially caused by SW&#x27;s need to pay off debt. Sesame Workshop remained involved with the network&#x27;s programming, as Viacom entered a multi-year production deal with Sesame Workshop shortly after the split and continued to broadcast the company&#x27;s shows. The last collaboration between Noggin and Sesame Workshop was &quot;The Upside Down Show&quot;, which premiered in 2006.

Outside of Noggin, Knell was instrumental in the creation of the cable channel Sprout (now Universal Kids, shutting down in March 2025) in 2005. Sprout (launched as PBS Kids Sprout) was founded as a partnership between the Workshop, Comcast, PBS, and HIT Entertainment, all of whom contributed older programming from their archive libraries to the new network. After seven years as a partner, the Workshop divested its stake in Sprout to NBCUniversal in December 2012.

In 2007, the Sesame Workshop founded The Joan Ganz Cooney Center, an independent, non-profit organization that studies how to improve children&#x27;s literacy by using and developing digital technologies &quot;grounded in detailed educational curriculum&quot;, just as was done during the development of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

The 2008–2009 recession, which resulted in budget reductions for many nonprofit arts organizations, severely affected the organization; in 2009, it had to dismiss 20% of its staff. Despite earning about $100 million from licensing revenue, royalties, and foundation and government funding in 2012, the Workshop&#x27;s total revenue was down 15% and its operating loss doubled to $24.3 million. In 2013, it responded by dismissing 10% of its staff, saying that it was necessary to &quot;strategically focus&quot; their resources because of &quot;today&#x27;s rapidly changing digital environment&quot;. In 2011, Knell left Sesame Workshop to become the chief executive of National Public Radio (NPR). H. Melvin Ming, who had been the organization&#x27;s chief financial officer since 1999 and chief operating officer since 2002, was named as his replacement. In 2014, H. Melvin Ming retired and was succeeded by former HIT Entertainment and Nickelodeon executive Jeffery D. Dunn. Dunn&#x27;s appointment was the first time someone not affiliated with CTW or Sesame Workshop became its manager, although he had associations with the organization previously. In 2021, Dunn retired. It was replaced by Sherrie Rollins Westin, who had served as president of SW&#x27;s Social Impact and Philanthropy Division for six years.

In 2019, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; reported that Sesame Workshop&#x27;s operating income was approximately $1.6 million, after the majority of its funds earned from grants, licensing deals, and royalties went back into its content, its total operating costs were over $100 million per year. Operating costs included salaries, $6 million in rent for its Lincoln Center corporate offices, its production facilities in Queens, and the costs of producing content for its YouTube channels and other outlets. The organization employed about 400 people, including &quot;several highly skilled puppeteers&quot;. Royalties and distribution fees, which accounted for $52.9 million in 2018, made up the Workshop&#x27;s biggest revenue source. Donations brought in $47.8 million, or 31 percent of its income. Licensing revenue from games, toys, and clothing earned the organization $4.5 million.

== Funding sources ==
After &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s initial success, the CTW began to think about its survival beyond the development and first season of the show, since its funding sources were composed of organizations and institutions that tended to start projects, not sustain them. Although the organization was what Cooney termed &quot;the darling of the federal government for a brief period of two or three years&quot;, its first ten years of existence was marked by conflicts between the two; in 1978, the US Department of Education refused to deliver a $2 million check until the last day of the CTW&#x27;s fiscal year. According to Davis, the federal government was opposed to funding public television, but the Workshop used Cooney&#x27;s prestige and fame, and the fact that there would be &quot;great public outcry&quot; if the series was de-funded, to withstand the government&#x27;s attacks on PBS. Eventually, the CTW got its own line item in the federal budget. By 2019, the U.S. government donated about four percent of the Workshop&#x27;s budget, or less than $5 million a year.

For the first time, a public broadcasting series had the potential to earn a great deal of money. Immediately after its premiere, &quot;Sesame Street &quot;gained attention from marketers, so the Workshop explored sources such as licensing arrangements, publishing, and international sales, and became, as Cooney envisioned, a &quot;multiple media institution&quot;. Licensing became the foundation of, as writer Louise Gikow stated, the Sesame Workshop endowment, which had the potential to fund the organization and future productions and projects. Muppet creator Jim Henson owned the trademarks to the Muppet characters: he was reluctant to market them at first, but agreed when the CTW promised that the profits from toys, books, and other products were to be used exclusively to fund the CTW. The producers demanded complete control of all products and product decisions throughout its history; any product line associated with the series had to be educational, inexpensive, and not advertised during broadcastings of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. As Davis reported, &quot;Cooney stressed restraint, prudence, and caution&quot; in their marketing and licensing efforts. In the early 1970s, the CTW negotiated with Random House to establish and manage a non-broadcast materials division. Random House and the CTW named Christopher Cerf to assist the CTW in publishing books and other materials that emphasized the series&#x27; curriculum. By 2019, the Sesame Workshop had over 500 licensing agreements, and its total revenue in 2018 was $35 million. A million children play with &quot;Sesame Street&quot;-themed toys per day.

Soon after the premiere of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, producers, educators, and officials of other nations began requesting that a version of the series be broadcast in their countries. CBS executive Michael Dann was required to quit his job at that network due to a change of corporate policy preceding the so-called &quot;rural purge&quot;; upon his ouster, he became vice-president of the CTW and Cooney&#x27;s assistant. Dann then began developing foreign versions of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; by arranging what were eventually termed co-productions, or independent programs with their own sets, characters, and curriculum goals. By 2009, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; had expanded into 140 countries; &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 2005 that income from the CTW&#x27;s international co-productions of the series was $96 million. By 2008, the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; Muppets accounted for between $15 million and $17 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees, divided between the Workshop and Henson Associates. The Workshop began pursuing funding from corporate sponsors in 1998; consumer advocate Ralph Nader urged parents to protest the move by boycotting the show. In 2018 the Workshop made a deal with Apple to develop original content including puppet series for Apple&#x27;s streaming service. In 2019, &quot;Parade Magazine&quot; reported that the organization had received two $100 million grants from the MacArthur Foundation and from the LEGO Foundation; the funds were used to undertake &quot;the largest early childhood intervention in the history of humanitarian response to help refugee children and families&quot;.

=== Publishing ===
In 1970, the CTW established a department managing the development of &quot;nonbroadcast&quot; materials based upon &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. The Workshop decided that all materials its licensing program created would &quot;underscore and amplify&quot; the series&#x27; curriculum. Coloring books, for example, were prohibited because the Workshop felt they would restrict children&#x27;s imaginations. CTW published &quot;Sesame Street Magazine&quot; in 1970, which incorporated the show&#x27;s curriculum goals in a magazine format. As with the series, research was performed for the magazine, initially by CTW&#x27;s research department for a year and a half, and then by the Magazine Research Group in 1975.

Working with Random House editor Jason Epstein, the CTW hired Christopher Cerf to manage &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s book publishing program. During the division&#x27;s first year, Cerf earned $900,000 for the CTW. He quit to become more involved with writing and composing music for the series, and was replaced eventually by Bill Whaley. Ann Kearns, vice president of licensing for the CTW in 2000, stated that Whaley was responsible for expanding the licensing to other products, and for creating a licensing model used by other children&#x27;s series. As of 2019, the Workshop had published over 6,500 book titles. and as researcher Renee Cherow-O&#x27;Leary stated in 2001, &quot;the print materials produced by CTW have been an enduring part of the legacy of Sesame Street&quot;. In one of these books, for example, the death of the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; character Mr. Hooper was featured in a book entitled &quot;I&#x27;ll Miss You, Mr. Hooper&quot;, published soon after the series featured it in 1983. In 2019, &quot;Parade Magazine&quot; reported that 20 million copies of &quot;The Monster at the End of the Book&quot; and &quot;Another Monster at the End of this Book&quot; had been sold, making them the top two best-selling e-books sold. Its YouTube channel had almost 5 million subscribers.

=== Music ===
According to director Jon Stone, the music of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; was unlike any other children&#x27;s program on television. For the first time, the show&#x27;s songs fulfilled a specific purpose and was related to its curriculum. Cooney observed in her initial report that children had an &quot;affinity for commercial jingles&quot;, so many of the show&#x27;s songs were like television advertisements.

To attract the best composers and lyricists, and to encourage them to compose more music for the series, the CTW allowed songwriters to retain the rights to the songs they wrote. For the first time in children&#x27;s television, the writers earned lucrative profits, which as Davis reported, &quot;helped the show sustain the level of public interest in the show&quot;. Scriptwriters often wrote their own lyrics to accompany their scripts. Songwriters of note were Joe Raposo, Jeff Moss, Christopher Cerf, Tony Geiss, and Norman Stiles. Many of the songs written for &quot;Sesame Street&quot; have become what writer David Borgenicht termed &quot;timeless classics&quot;. These songs included &quot;Can You Tell Me How to Get to Sesame Street?&quot;, &quot;I Love Trash&quot;, &quot;Rubber Duckie&quot;, &quot;Bein&#x27; Green&quot;, and &quot;Sing&quot;. Many &quot;Sesame Street&quot; songs were recorded by well-known artists such as Barbra Streisand, Lena Horne, Dizzy Gillespie, Paul Simon, and Jose Feliciano. By 2019, there were 180 albums of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; music produced.

The show&#x27;s first album, &quot;Sesame Street Book &amp; Record&quot;, recorded in 1970, was a major success and won a Grammy Award. &quot;Parade Magazine&quot; reported in 2019 that the show&#x27;s music had been honored with 11 children&#x27;s Grammys. According to Gikow, Raposo won three Emmys and four Grammys for his work for the series.

=== International co-productions ===

Soon after &quot;Sesame Street&quot; debuted in the US, the CTW was asked independently by producers from several countries to produce versions of the series in their countries. Cooney remarked, &quot;To be frank, I was really surprised, because we thought we were creating the quintessential American show. We thought the Muppets were quintessentially American, and it turns out they&#x27;re the most international characters ever created&quot;. She hired former CBS executive Mike Dann, who quit commercial television to become her assistant, as a CTW vice-president. One of Dann&#x27;s tasks was to manage offers to produce versions of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in other countries. In response to Dann&#x27;s appointment, television critic Marvin Kitman said, &quot;After [Dann] sells [&quot;Sesame Street&quot;] in Russia and Czechoslovakia, he might try Mississippi, where it is considered too controversial for educational TV&quot;. This was a reference to the May 1970 decision by the state&#x27;s PBS station to not air the series. By summer 1970, Dann had made the first international agreements for what the CTW came to term &quot;co-productions&quot;.

The earliest international versions were what CTW vice-president Charlotte Cole and her colleagues termed &quot;fairly simple&quot;, consisting of dubbed versions of the series with local language voice-overs and instructional cutaways. Dubbed versions of the series continued to be produced if the country&#x27;s needs and resources warranted it. Eventually, a variant of the CTW model was used to create and produce independently produced preschool television series in other countries. By 2006, there were twenty co-productions. In 2001, there were more than 120 million viewers of all international versions of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, and by the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 2019, 190 million children viewed over 160 versions of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in 70 languages. In 2005, Doreen Carvajal of &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that income from the co-productions and international licensing accounted for $96 million. As Cole and her colleagues reported in 2000, &quot;Children&#x27;s Television Workshop (CTW) can be regarded as the single largest informal educator of young children in the world&quot;.

=== Interactive media ===

Ten years after the premiere of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, the CTW began experimenting with new technologies. In 1979, it began to plan the development of a theme park, Sesame Place, which opened in 1980 in Langhorne, Pennsylvania. Three international parks, &quot;Parque Plaza Sesamo&quot; in Monterrey, Mexico since 1995, Universal Studios Japan, and &quot;Vila Sesamo&quot; Kids&#x27; Land in Brazil were later built. One of the park&#x27;s features was a computer gallery, which was developed by a small in-house team and included 55 computer programs. The team evolved into the Children&#x27;s Computer Workshop (CCW) in 1982, which was disbanded and became the Interactive Technologies division of the CTW in the late 1980s. As &quot;Sesame Street&quot; researcher Shalom M. Fisch stated, no television series could be as interactive as computer games, even &quot;participatory&quot; shows like &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; or the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; segment &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot;. The CTW has chosen to take advantage of the contingent feedback inherent in interactive computer games by developing and creating educational software based upon the television series&#x27; content and curriculum.

In 2008, Sesame Workshop began to offer clips and full-length episodes on the websites Hulu, YouTube, and iTunes, where &quot;Word on the Street&quot; segments became the most popular webcast. Sesame Workshop won a Peabody Award in 2009 for its website, sesamestreet.org. In 2010, the Workshop began offering, for a subscription fee, a library of over 100 eBooks. The on-line publishing platform was managed by the electronic publishing company Impelsys.
