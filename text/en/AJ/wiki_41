<text>A barometer is a scientific instrument that is used to measure air pressure in a certain environment. Pressure tendency can forecast short term changes in the weather. Many measurements of air pressure are used within surface weather analysis to help find surface troughs, pressure systems and frontal boundaries.

Barometers and pressure altimeters (the most basic and common type of altimeter) are essentially the same instrument, but used for different purposes. An altimeter is intended to be used at different levels matching the corresponding atmospheric pressure to the altitude, while a barometer is kept at the same level and measures subtle pressure changes caused by weather and elements of weather. The average atmospheric pressure on the Earth&#x27;s surface varies between 940 and 1040 hPa (mbar). The average atmospheric pressure at sea level is 1013 hPa (mbar).

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek (), meaning &quot;weight&quot;, and (), meaning &quot;measure&quot;.

== History ==
Evangelista Torricelli is usually credited with inventing the barometer in 1643,&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/history/barometerhistory1.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.barometerfair.com/history_of_the_barometer.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; although the historian W. E. Knowles Middleton suggests the more likely date is 1644 (when Torricelli first reported his experiments; the 1643 date was only suggested after his death). Gasparo Berti, an Italian mathematician and astronomer, also built a rudimentary water barometer sometime between 1640 and 1644, but it was not a true barometer as it was not intended to move and record variable air pressure. French scientist and philosopher René Descartes described the design of an experiment to determine atmospheric pressure as early as 1631, but there is no evidence that he built a working barometer at that time.

=== Baliani&#x27;s siphon experiment ===

On 27 July 1630, Giovanni Battista Baliani wrote a letter to Galileo Galilei explaining an experiment he had made in which a siphon, led over a hill about 21 m high, failed to work. When the end of the siphon was opened in a reservoir, the water level in that limb would sink to about 10 m above the reservoir. Galileo responded with an explanation of the phenomenon: he proposed that it was the power of a vacuum that held the water up, and at a certain height the amount of water simply became too much and the force could not hold any more, like a cord that can support only so much weight. This was a restatement of the theory of &quot;horror vacui&quot; (&quot;nature abhors a vacuum&quot;), which dates to Aristotle, and which Galileo restated as &quot;resistenza del vacuo&quot;.

=== Berti&#x27;s vacuum experiment ===

Galileo&#x27;s ideas, presented in his &quot;Discorsi&quot; (&quot;Two New Sciences&quot;), reached Rome in December 1638. Physicists Gasparo Berti and father Raffaello Magiotti were excited by these ideas, and decided to seek a better way to attempt to produce a vacuum other than with a siphon. Magiotti devised such an experiment. Four accounts of the experiment exist, all written some years later. No exact date was given, but since &quot;Two New Sciences&quot; reached Rome in December 1638, and Berti died before January 2, 1644, science historian W. E. Knowles Middleton places the event to sometime between 1639 and 1643. Present were Berti, Magiotti, Jesuit polymath Athanasius Kircher, and Jesuit physicist Niccolò Zucchi.

In brief, Berti&#x27;s experiment consisted of filling with water a long tube that had both ends plugged, then standing the tube in a basin of water. The bottom end of the tube was opened, and water that had been inside of it poured out into the basin. However, only part of the water in the tube flowed out, and the level of the water inside the tube stayed at an exact level, which happened to be , the same height limit Baliani had observed in the siphon. What was most important about this experiment was that the lowering water had left a space above it in the tube which had no intermediate contact with air to fill it up. This seemed to suggest the possibility of a vacuum existing in the space above the water.

=== Evangelista Torricelli ===

Evangelista Torricelli, a friend and student of Galileo, interpreted the results of the experiments in a novel way. He proposed that the weight of the atmosphere, not an attracting force of the vacuum, held the water in the tube. In a letter to Michelangelo Ricci in 1644 concerning the experiments, he wrote:

Many have said that a vacuum does not exist, others that it does exist in spite of the repugnance of nature and with difficulty; I know of no one who has said that it exists without difficulty and without a resistance from nature. I argued thus: If there can be found a manifest cause from which the resistance can be derived which is felt if we try to make a vacuum, it seems to me foolish to try to attribute to vacuum those operations which follow evidently from some other cause; and so by making some very easy calculations, I found that the cause assigned by me (that is, the weight of the atmosphere) ought by itself alone to offer a greater resistance than it does when we try to produce a vacuum.

It was traditionally thought, especially by the Aristotelians, that the air did not have weight; that is, that the kilometers of air above the surface of the Earth did not exert any weight on the bodies below it. Even Galileo had accepted the weightlessness of air as a simple truth. Torricelli proposed that rather than an attractive force of the vacuum sucking up water, air did indeed have weight, which pushed on the water, holding up a column of it. He argued that the level that the water stayed at—c. 10.3 m above the water surface below—was reflective of the force of the air&#x27;s weight pushing on the water in the basin, setting a limit for how far down the water level could sink in a tall, closed, water-filled tube. He viewed the barometer as a balance—an instrument for measurement—as opposed to merely an instrument for creating a vacuum, and since he was the first to view it this way, he is traditionally considered the inventor of the barometer, in the sense in which we now use the term.

==== Torricelli&#x27;s mercury barometer ====

Because of rumors circulating in Torricelli&#x27;s gossipy Italian neighbourhood, which included that he was engaged in some form of sorcery or witchcraft, Torricelli realized he had to keep his experiment secret to avoid the risk of being arrested. He needed to use a liquid that was heavier than water, and from his previous association and suggestions by Galileo, he deduced that by using mercury, a shorter tube could be used. With mercury, which is about 14 times denser than water, a tube only 80 cm was now needed, not 10.5 m.

=== Blaise Pascal ===

In 1646, Blaise Pascal along with Pierre Petit, had repeated and perfected Torricelli&#x27;s experiment after hearing about it from Marin Mersenne, who himself had been shown the experiment by Torricelli toward the end of 1644. Pascal further devised an experiment to test the Aristotelian proposition that it was vapours from the liquid that filled the space in a barometer. His experiment compared water with wine, and since the latter was considered more &quot;spiritous&quot;, the Aristotelians expected the wine to stand lower (since more vapours would mean more pushing down on the liquid column). Pascal performed the experiment publicly, inviting the Aristotelians to predict the outcome beforehand. The Aristotelians predicted the wine would stand lower. It did not.

==== First atmospheric pressure vs. altitude experiment ====

However, Pascal went even further to test the mechanical theory. If, as suspected by mechanical philosophers like Torricelli and Pascal, air had weight, the pressure would be less at higher altitudes. Therefore, Pascal wrote to his brother-in-law, Florin Perier, who lived near a mountain called the Puy de Dôme, asking him to perform a crucial experiment. Perier was to take a barometer up the Puy de Dôme and make measurements along the way of the height of the column of mercury. He was then to compare it to measurements taken at the foot of the mountain to see if those measurements taken higher up were in fact smaller. In September 1648, Perier carefully and meticulously carried out the experiment, and found that Pascal&#x27;s predictions had been correct. The column of mercury stood lower as the barometer was carried to a higher altitude.

== Types ==

=== Water barometers ===

The concept that decreasing atmospheric pressure predicts stormy weather, postulated by Lucien Vidi, provides the theoretical basis for a weather prediction device called a &quot;weather glass&quot; or a &quot;Goethe barometer&quot; (named for Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the renowned German writer and polymath who developed a simple but effective weather ball barometer using the principles developed by Torricelli). The French name, &quot;le baromètre Liègeois&quot;, is used by some English speakers. This name reflects the origins of many early weather glasses – the glass blowers of Liège, Belgium.

The weather ball barometer consists of a glass container with a sealed body, half filled with water. A narrow spout connects to the body below the water level and rises above the water level. The narrow spout is open to the atmosphere. When the air pressure is lower than it was at the time the body was sealed, the water level in the spout will rise above the water level in the body; when the air pressure is higher, the water level in the spout will drop below the water level in the body. A variation of this type of barometer can be easily made at home.

=== Mercury barometers ===
A mercury barometer is an instrument used to measure atmospheric pressure in a certain location and has a vertical glass tube closed at the top sitting in an open mercury-filled basin at the bottom. Mercury in the tube adjusts until the weight of it balances the atmospheric force exerted on the reservoir. High atmospheric pressure places more force on the reservoir, forcing mercury higher in the column. Low pressure allows the mercury to drop to a lower level in the column by lowering the force placed on the reservoir. Since higher temperature levels around the instrument will reduce the density of the mercury, the scale for reading the height of the mercury is adjusted to compensate for this effect. The tube has to be at least as long as the amount dipping in the mercury + head space + the maximum length of the column.

Torricelli documented that the height of the mercury in a barometer changed slightly each day and concluded that this was due to the changing pressure in the atmosphere. He wrote: &quot;We live submerged at the bottom of an ocean of elementary air, which is known by incontestable experiments to have weight&quot;. Inspired by Torricelli, Otto von Guericke on 5 December 1660 found that air pressure was unusually low and predicted a storm, which occurred the next day.
The mercury barometer&#x27;s design gives rise to the expression of atmospheric pressure in inches or millimeters of mercury (mmHg). A torr was originally defined as 1 mmHg. The pressure is quoted as the level of the mercury&#x27;s height in the vertical column. Typically, atmospheric pressure is measured between and of Hg. One atmosphere (1 atm) is equivalent to of mercury.

Design changes to make the instrument more sensitive, simpler to read, and easier to transport resulted in variations such as the basin, siphon, wheel, cistern, Fortin, multiple folded, stereometric, and balance barometers.

In 2007, a European Union directive was enacted to restrict the use of mercury in new measuring instruments intended for the general public, effectively ending the production of new mercury barometers in Europe. The repair and trade of antiques (produced before late 1957) remained unrestricted.

==== Fitzroy barometer ====
&quot;Fitzroy&quot; barometers combine the standard mercury barometer with a thermometer, as well as a guide of how to interpret pressure changes.

==== Fortin barometer ====
Fortin barometers use a variable displacement mercury cistern, usually constructed with a thumbscrew pressing on a leather diaphragm bottom (V in the diagram). This compensates for displacement of mercury in the column with varying pressure. To use a Fortin barometer, the level of mercury is set to zero by using the thumbscrew to make an ivory pointer (O in the diagram) just touch the surface of the mercury. The pressure is then read on the column by adjusting the vernier scale so that the mercury just touches the sightline at Z. Some models also employ a valve for closing the cistern, enabling the mercury column to be forced to the top of the column for transport. This prevents water-hammer damage to the column in transit.

===Sympiesometer===
A sympiesometer is a compact and lightweight barometer that was widely used on ships in the early 19th century. The sensitivity of this barometer was also used to measure altitude.

Sympiesometers have two parts. One is a traditional mercury thermometer that is needed to calculate the expansion or contraction of the fluid in the barometer. The other is the barometer, consisting of a J-shaped tube open at the lower end and closed at the top, with small reservoirs at both ends of the tube.

==== Wheel barometers ====
A wheel barometer uses a &quot;J&quot; tube sealed at the top of the longer limb. The shorter limb is open to the atmosphere, and floating on top of the mercury there is a small glass float. A fine silken thread is attached to the float which passes up over a wheel and then back down to a counterweight (usually protected in another tube). The wheel turns the point on the front of the barometer. As atmospheric pressure increases, mercury moves from the short to the long limb, the float falls, and the pointer moves. When pressure falls, the mercury moves back, lifting the float and turning the dial the other way.

Around 1810 the wheel barometer, which could be read from a great distance, became the first practical and commercial instrument favoured by farmers and the educated classes in the UK. The face of the barometer was circular with a simple dial pointing to an easily readable scale: &quot;Rain - Change - Dry&quot; with the &quot;Change&quot; at the top centre of the dial. Later models added a barometric scale with finer graduations: &quot;Stormy (28 inches of mercury), Much Rain (28.5), Rain (29), Change (29.5), Fair (30), Set fair (30.5), very dry(31)&quot;.

Natalo Aiano is recognised as one of the finest makers of wheel barometers, an early pioneer in a wave of artisanal Italian instrument and barometer makers that were encouraged to emigrate to the UK. He listed as working in Holborn, London –1805. From 1770 onwards, a large number of Italians came to England because they were accomplished glass blowers or instrument makers. By 1840 it was fair to say that the Italians dominated the industry in England.

===Vacuum pump oil barometer===

Using vacuum pump oil as the working fluid in a barometer has led to the creation of the new &quot;World&#x27;s Tallest Barometer&quot; in February 2013. The barometer at Portland State University (PSU) uses doubly distilled vacuum pump oil and has a nominal height of about 12.4 m for the oil column height; expected excursions are in the range of ±0.4 m over the course of a year. Vacuum pump oil has very low vapour pressure and is available in a range of densities; the lowest density vacuum oil was chosen for the PSU barometer to maximize the oil column height.

=== Aneroid barometers ===
An aneroid barometer is an instrument used for measuring air pressure via a method that does not involve liquid. Invented in 1844 by French scientist Lucien Vidi, the aneroid barometer uses a small, flexible metal box called an aneroid cell (capsule), which is made from an alloy of beryllium and copper. The evacuated capsule (or usually several capsules, stacked to add up their movements) is prevented from collapsing by a strong spring. Small changes in external air pressure cause the cell to expand or contract. This expansion and contraction drives mechanical levers such that the tiny movements of the capsule are amplified and displayed on the face of the aneroid barometer. Many models include a manually set needle which is used to mark the current measurement so that a relative change can be seen. This type of barometer is common in homes and in recreational boats. It is also used in meteorology, mostly in barographs, and as a pressure instrument in radiosondes.

==== Barographs ====

A barograph is a recording aneroid barometer where the changes in atmospheric pressure are recorded on a paper chart.

The principle of the barograph is same as that of the aneroid barometer. Whereas the barometer displays the pressure on a dial, the barograph uses the small movements of the box to transmit by a system of levers to a recording arm that has at its extreme end either a scribe or a pen. A scribe records on smoked foil while a pen records on paper using ink, held in a nib. The recording material is mounted on a cylindrical drum which is rotated slowly by a clock. Commonly, the drum makes one revolution per day, per week, or per month, and the rotation rate can often be selected by the user.

=== MEMS barometers ===

Microelectromechanical systems (or MEMS) barometers are extremely small devices between 1 and 100 micrometres in size (0.001 to 0.1 mm). They are created via photolithography or photochemical machining. Typical applications include miniaturized weather stations, electronic barometers and altimeters.

A barometer can also be found in smartphones such as the Samsung Galaxy Nexus, Samsung Galaxy S3-S6, Motorola Xoom, Apple iPhone 6 and newer iPhones, and Timex Expedition WS4 smartwatch, based on MEMS and piezoresistive pressure-sensing technologies. Inclusion of barometers on smartphones was originally intended to provide a faster GPS lock. However, third party researchers were unable to confirm additional GPS accuracy or lock speed due to barometric readings. The researchers suggest that the inclusion of barometers in smartphones may provide a solution for determining a user&#x27;s elevation, but also suggest that several pitfalls must first be overcome.

=== More unusual barometers ===
There are many other more unusual types of barometer. From variations on the storm barometer, such as the Collins Patent Table Barometer, to more traditional-looking designs such as Hooke&#x27;s Otheometer and the Ross Sympiesometer. Some, such as the Shark Oil barometer, work only in a certain temperature range, achieved in warmer climates.

== Applications ==

Barometric pressure and the pressure tendency (the change of pressure over time) have been used in weather forecasting since the late 19th century. When used in combination with wind observations, reasonably accurate short-term forecasts can be made. Simultaneous barometric readings from across a network of weather stations allow maps of air pressure to be produced, which were the first form of the modern weather map when created in the 19th century. Isobars, lines of equal pressure, when drawn on such a map, give a contour map showing areas of high and low pressure. Localized high atmospheric pressure acts as a barrier to approaching weather systems, diverting their course. Atmospheric lift caused by low-level wind convergence into the surface brings clouds and sometimes precipitation. The larger the change in pressure, especially if more than 3.5 hPa (0.1 inHg), the greater the change in weather that can be expected. If the pressure drop is rapid, a low pressure system is approaching, and there is a greater chance of rain. Rapid pressure rises, such as in the wake of a cold front, are associated with improving weather conditions, such as clearing skies.

With falling air pressure, gases trapped within the coal in deep mines can escape more freely. Thus low pressure increases the risk of firedamp accumulating. Collieries therefore keep track of the pressure. In the case of the Trimdon Grange colliery disaster of 1882 the mines inspector drew attention to the records and in the report stated &quot;the conditions of atmosphere and temperature may be taken to have reached a dangerous point&quot;.

Aneroid barometers are used in scuba diving. A submersible pressure gauge is used to keep track of the contents of the diver&#x27;s air tank. Another gauge is used to measure the hydrostatic pressure, usually expressed as a depth of sea water. Either or both gauges may be replaced with electronic variants or a dive computer.

== Compensations ==
=== Temperature ===
The density of mercury will change with increase or decrease in temperature, so a reading must be adjusted for the temperature of the instrument. For this purpose a mercury thermometer is usually mounted on the instrument. Temperature compensation of an aneroid barometer is accomplished by including a bi-metal element in the mechanical linkages. Aneroid barometers sold for domestic use typically have no compensation under the assumption that they will be used within a controlled room temperature range.

=== Altitude ===
As the air pressure decreases at altitudes above sea level (and increases below sea level) the uncorrected reading of the barometer will depend on its location. The reading is then adjusted to an equivalent sea-level pressure for purposes of reporting. For example, if a barometer located at sea level and under fair weather conditions is moved to an altitude of 1,000 feet (305 m), about 1 inch of mercury (~35 hPa) must be added on to the reading. The barometer readings at the two locations should be the same if there are negligible changes in time, horizontal distance, and temperature. If this were not done, there would be a false indication of an approaching storm at the higher elevation.

Aneroid barometers have a mechanical adjustment that allows the equivalent sea level pressure to be read directly and without further adjustment if the instrument is not moved to a different altitude. Setting an aneroid barometer is similar to resetting an analog clock that is not at the correct time. Its dial is rotated so that the current atmospheric pressure from a known accurate and nearby barometer (such as the local weather station) is displayed. No calculation is needed, as the source barometer reading has already been converted to equivalent sea-level pressure, and this is transferred to the barometer being set—regardless of its altitude. Though somewhat rare, a few aneroid barometers intended for monitoring the weather are calibrated to manually adjust for altitude. In this case, knowing &quot;either&quot; the altitude or the current atmospheric pressure would be sufficient for future accurate readings.

The table below shows examples for three locations in the city of San Francisco, California. Note the corrected barometer readings are identical, and based on equivalent sea-level pressure. (Assume a temperature of 15 °C.)

In 1787, during a scientific expedition on Mont Blanc, De Saussure undertook research and executed physical experiments on the boiling point of water at different heights. He calculated the height at each of his experiments by measuring how long it took an alcohol burner to boil an amount of water, and by these means he determined the height of the mountain to be 4775 metres. (This later turned out to be 32 metres less than the actual height of 4807 metres). For these experiments De Saussure brought specific scientific equipment, such as a barometer and thermometer. His calculated boiling temperature of water at the top of the mountain was fairly accurate, only off by 0.1 kelvin.

Based on his findings, the altimeter could be developed as a specific application of the barometer. In the mid-19th century, this method was used by explorers.

==Equation==
When atmospheric pressure is measured by a barometer, the pressure is also referred to as the &quot;barometric pressure&quot;. Assume a barometer with a cross-sectional area &quot;A&quot;, a height &quot;h&quot;, filled with mercury from the bottom at Point B to the top at Point C. The pressure at the bottom of the barometer, Point B, is equal to the atmospheric pressure. The pressure at the very top, Point C, can be taken as zero because there is only mercury vapour above this point and its pressure is very low relative to the atmospheric pressure. Therefore, one can find the atmospheric pressure using the barometer and this equation:

:Patm = ρgh

where ρ is the density of mercury, g is the gravitational acceleration, and h is the height of the mercury column above the free surface area. The physical dimensions (length of tube and cross-sectional area of the tube) of the barometer itself have no effect on the height of the fluid column in the tube.

In thermodynamic calculations, a commonly used pressure unit is the &quot;standard atmosphere&quot;. This is the pressure resulting from a column of mercury of 760 mm in height at 0 °C. For the density of mercury, use ρHg = 13,595 kg/m3 and for gravitational acceleration use g = 9.807 m/s2.

If water were used (instead of mercury) to meet the standard atmospheric pressure, a water column of roughly 10.3 m (33.8 ft) would be needed.

Standard atmospheric pressure as a function of elevation:

Note: 1 torr = 133.3 Pa = 0.03937 inHg

<text>Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi. It is generally assumed to be a natural process, which differentiates it from composting. Composting is a human-driven process in which biodegradation occurs under a specific set of circumstances.

The process of biodegradation is threefold: first an object undergoes biodeterioration, which is the mechanical weakening of its structure; then follows biofragmentation, which is the breakdown of materials by microorganisms; and finally assimilation, which is the incorporation of the old material into new cells.

In practice, almost all chemical compounds and materials are subject to biodegradation, the key element being time. Things like vegetables may degrade within days, while glass and some plastics take many millennia to decompose. A standard for biodegradability used by the European Union is that greater than 90% of the original material must be converted into , water and minerals by biological processes within 6 months.

== Mechanisms ==
The process of biodegradation can be divided into three stages: biodeterioration, biofragmentation, and assimilation. Biodeterioration is sometimes described as a surface-level degradation that modifies the mechanical, physical and chemical properties of the material. This stage occurs when the material is exposed to abiotic factors in the outdoor environment and allows for further degradation by weakening the material&#x27;s structure. Some abiotic factors that influence these initial changes are compression (mechanical), light, temperature and chemicals in the environment. While biodeterioration typically occurs as the first stage of biodegradation, it can in some cases be parallel to biofragmentation. Hueck, however, defined Biodeterioration as the undesirable action of living organisms on Man&#x27;s materials, involving such things as breakdown of stone facades of buildings, corrosion of metals by microorganisms or merely the esthetic changes induced on man-made structures by the growth of living organisms.

Biofragmentation of a polymer is the lytic process in which bonds within a polymer are cleaved, generating oligomers and monomers in its place. The steps taken to fragment these materials also differ based on the presence of oxygen in the system. The breakdown of materials by microorganisms when oxygen is present is aerobic digestion, and the breakdown of materials when oxygen is not present is anaerobic digestion. The main difference between these processes is that anaerobic reactions produce methane, while aerobic reactions do not (however, both reactions produce carbon dioxide, water, some type of residue, and a new biomass). In addition, aerobic digestion typically occurs more rapidly than anaerobic digestion, while anaerobic digestion does a better job reducing the volume and mass of the material. Due to anaerobic digestion&#x27;s ability to reduce the volume and mass of waste materials and produce a natural gas, anaerobic digestion technology is widely used for waste management systems and as a source of local, renewable energy.

In the assimilation stage, the resulting products from biofragmentation are then integrated into microbial cells. Some of the products from fragmentation are easily transported within the cell by membrane carriers. However, others still have to undergo biotransformation reactions to yield products that can then be transported inside the cell. Once inside the cell, the products enter catabolic pathways that either lead to the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or elements of the cells structure.

== Factors affecting biodegradation rate ==

In practice, almost all chemical compounds and materials are subject to biodegradation processes. The significance, however, is in the relative rates of such processes, such as days, weeks, years or centuries. A number of factors determine the rate at which this degradation of organic compounds occurs. Factors include light, water, oxygen and temperature. The degradation rate of many organic compounds is limited by their bioavailability, which is the rate at which a substance is absorbed into a system or made available at the site of physiological activity, as compounds must be released into solution before organisms can degrade them. The rate of biodegradation can be measured in a number of ways. Respirometry tests can be used for aerobic microbes. First one places a solid waste sample in a container with microorganisms and soil, and then aerates the mixture. Over the course of several days, microorganisms digest the sample bit by bit and produce carbon dioxide – the resulting amount of CO2 serves as an indicator of degradation. Biodegradability can also be measured by anaerobic microbes and the amount of methane or alloy that they are able to produce.

It&#x27;s important to note factors that affect biodegradation rates during product testing to ensure that the results produced are accurate and reliable. Several materials will test as being biodegradable under optimal conditions in a lab for approval but these results may not reflect real world outcomes where factors are more variable. For example, a material may have tested as biodegrading at a high rate in the lab may not degrade at a high rate in a landfill because landfills often lack light, water, and microbial activity that are necessary for degradation to occur. Thus, it is very important that there are standards for plastic biodegradable products, which have a large impact on the environment. The development and use of accurate standard test methods can help ensure that all plastics that are being produced and commercialized will actually biodegrade in natural environments. One test that has been developed for this purpose is DINV 54900.

== Plastics ==
The term Biodegradable Plastics refers to materials that maintain their mechanical strength during practical use but break down into low-weight compounds and non-toxic byproducts after their use. This breakdown is made possible through an attack of microorganisms on the material, which is typically a non-water-soluble polymer. Such materials can be obtained through chemical synthesis, fermentation by microorganisms, and from chemically modified natural products.

Plastics biodegrade at highly variable rates. PVC-based plumbing is selected for handling sewage because PVC resists biodegradation. Some packaging materials on the other hand are being developed that would degrade readily upon exposure to the environment. Examples of synthetic polymers that biodegrade quickly include polycaprolactone, other polyesters and aromatic-aliphatic esters, due to their ester bonds being susceptible to attack by water. A prominent example is poly-3-hydroxybutyrate, the renewably derived polylactic acid. Others are the cellulose-based cellulose acetate and celluloid (cellulose nitrate).
Under low oxygen conditions plastics break down more slowly. The breakdown process can be accelerated in specially designed compost heap. Starch-based plastics will degrade within two to four months in a home compost bin, while polylactic acid is largely undecomposed, requiring higher temperatures. Polycaprolactone and polycaprolactone-starch composites decompose slower, but the starch content accelerates decomposition by leaving behind a porous, high surface area polycaprolactone. Nevertheless, it takes many months.

In 2016, a bacterium named &quot;Ideonella sakaiensis&quot; was found to biodegrade PET. In 2020, the PET degrading enzyme of the bacterium, PETase, has been genetically modified and combined with MHETase to break down PET faster, and also degrade PEF. In 2021, researchers reported that a mix of microorganisms from cow stomachs could break down three types of plastics.

Many plastic producers have gone so far even to say that their plastics are compostable, typically listing corn starch as an ingredient. However, these claims are questionable because the plastics industry operates under its own definition of compostable:
:&quot;that which is capable of undergoing biological decomposition in a compost site such that the material is not visually distinguishable and breaks down into carbon dioxide, water, inorganic compounds and biomass at a rate consistent with known compostable materials.&quot; (Ref: ASTM D 6002)

The term &quot;composting&quot; is often used informally to describe the biodegradation of packaging materials. Legal definitions exist for compostability, the process that leads to compost. Four criteria are offered by the European Union:
#Chemical composition: volatile matter and heavy metals as well as fluorine should be limited.
#Biodegradability: the conversion of &gt;90% of the original material into , water and minerals by biological processes within 6 months.
#Disintegrability: at least 90% of the original mass should be decomposed into particles that are able to pass through a 2x2 mm sieve.
#Quality: absence of toxic substances and other substances that impede composting.

== Biodegradable technology ==
Biodegradable technology is established technology with some applications in product packaging, production, and medicine. The chief barrier to widespread implementation is the trade-off between biodegradability and performance. For example, lactide-based plastics are inferior packaging properties in comparison to traditional materials.

Oxo-biodegradation is defined by CEN (the European Standards Organisation) as &quot;degradation resulting from oxidative and cell-mediated phenomena, either simultaneously or successively.&quot; While sometimes described as &quot;oxo-fragmentable,&quot; and &quot;oxo-degradable&quot; these terms describe only the first or oxidative phase and should not be used for material which degrades by the process of oxo-biodegradation defined by CEN: the correct description is &quot;oxo-biodegradable.&quot; Oxo-biodegradable formulations accelerate the biodegradation process but it takes considerable skill and experience to balance the ingredients within the formulations so as to provide the product with a useful life for a set period, followed by degradation and biodegradation.

Biodegradable technology is especially utilized by the bio-medical community. Biodegradable polymers are classified into three groups:
medical, ecological, and dual application, while in terms of origin they are divided into two groups: natural and synthetic. The Clean Technology Group is exploiting the use of supercritical carbon dioxide, which under high pressure at room temperature is a solvent that can use biodegradable plastics to make polymer drug coatings. The polymer (meaning a material composed of molecules with repeating structural units that form a long chain) is used to encapsulate a drug prior to injection in the body and is based on lactic acid, a compound normally produced in the body, and is thus able to be excreted naturally. The coating is designed for controlled release over a period of time, reducing the number of injections required and maximizing the therapeutic benefit. Professor Steve Howdle states that biodegradable polymers are particularly attractive for use in drug delivery, as once introduced into the body they require no retrieval or further manipulation and are degraded into soluble, non-toxic by-products. Different polymers degrade at different rates within the body and therefore polymer selection can be tailored to achieve desired release rates.

Other biomedical applications include the use of biodegradable, elastic shape-memory polymers. Biodegradable implant materials can now be used for minimally invasive surgical procedures through degradable thermoplastic polymers. These polymers are now able to change their shape with increase of temperature, causing shape memory capabilities as well as easily degradable sutures. As a result, implants can now fit through small incisions, doctors can easily perform complex deformations, and sutures and other material aides can naturally biodegrade after a completed surgery.

== Biodegradation vs. composting ==
There is no universal definition for biodegradation and there are various definitions of composting, which has led to much confusion between the terms. They are often lumped together; however, they do not have the same meaning. Biodegradation is the naturally-occurring breakdown of materials by microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi or other biological activity. Composting is a human-driven process in which biodegradation occurs under a specific set of circumstances. The predominant difference between the two is that one process is naturally-occurring and one is human-driven.

Biodegradable material is capable of decomposing without an oxygen source (anaerobically) into carbon dioxide, water, and biomass, but the timeline is not very specifically defined. Similarly, compostable material breaks down into carbon dioxide, water, and biomass; however, compostable material also breaks down into inorganic compounds. The process for composting is more specifically defined, as it is controlled by humans. Essentially, composting is an accelerated biodegradation process due to optimized circumstances. Additionally, the end product of composting not only returns to its previous state, but also generates and adds beneficial microorganisms to the soil called humus. This organic matter can be used in gardens and on farms to help grow healthier plants in the future. Composting more consistently occurs within a shorter time frame since it is a more defined process and is expedited by human intervention. Biodegradation can occur in different time frames under different circumstances, but is meant to occur naturally without human intervention.

Even within composting, there are different circumstances under which this can occur. The two main types of composting are at-home versus commercial. Both produce healthy soil to be reused – the main difference lies in what materials are able to go into the process. At-home composting is mostly used for food scraps and excess garden materials, such as weeds. Commercial composting is capable of breaking down more complex plant-based products, such as corn-based plastics and larger pieces of material, like tree branches. Commercial composting begins with a manual breakdown of the materials using a grinder or other machine to initiate the process. Because at-home composting usually occurs on a smaller scale and does not involve large machinery, these materials would not fully decompose in at-home composting. Furthermore, one study has compared and contrasted home and industrial composting, concluding that there are advantages and disadvantages to both.

The following studies provide examples in which composting has been defined as a subset of biodegradation in a scientific context. The first study, &quot;Assessment of Biodegradability of Plastics Under Simulated Composting Conditions in a Laboratory Test Setting,&quot; clearly examines composting as a set of circumstances that falls under the category of degradation. Additionally, this next study looked at the biodegradation and composting effects of chemically and physically crosslinked polylactic acid. Notably discussing composting and biodegrading as two distinct terms. The third and final study reviews European standardization of biodegradable and compostable material in the packaging industry, again using the terms separately.

The distinction between these terms is crucial because waste management confusion leads to improper disposal of materials by people on a daily basis. Biodegradation technology has led to massive improvements in how we dispose of waste; there now exist trash, recycling, and compost bins in order to optimize the disposal process. However, if these waste streams are commonly and frequently confused, then the disposal process is not at all optimized. Biodegradable and compostable materials have been developed to ensure more of human waste is able to breakdown and return to its previous state, or in the case of composting even add nutrients to the ground. When a compostable product is thrown out as opposed to composted and sent to a landfill, these inventions and efforts are wasted. Therefore, it is important for citizens to understand the difference between these terms so that materials can be disposed of properly and efficiently.

== Environmental and social effects ==
Plastic pollution from illegal dumping poses health risks to wildlife. Animals often mistake plastics for food, resulting in intestinal entanglement. Slow-degrading chemicals, like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), nonylphenol (NP), and pesticides also found in plastics, can release into environments and subsequently also be ingested by wildlife.

These chemicals also play a role in human health, as consumption of tainted food (in processes called biomagnification and bioaccumulation) has been linked to issues such as cancers, neurological dysfunction, and hormonal changes. A well-known example of biomagnification impacting health in recent times is the increased exposure to dangerously high levels of mercury in fish, which can affect sex hormones in humans.

In efforts to remediate the damages done by slow-degrading plastics, detergents, metals, and other pollutants created by humans, economic costs have become a concern. Marine litter in particular is notably difficult to quantify and review. Researchers at the World Trade Institute estimate that cleanup initiatives&#x27; cost (specifically in ocean ecosystems) has hit close to thirteen billion dollars a year. The main concern stems from marine environments, with the biggest cleanup efforts centering around garbage patches in the ocean. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a garbage patch the size of Mexico, is located in the Pacific Ocean. It is estimated to be upwards of a million square miles in size. While the patch contains more obvious examples of litter (plastic bottles, cans, and bags), tiny microplastics are nearly impossible to clean up. &quot;National Geographic&quot; reports that even more non-biodegradable materials are finding their way into vulnerable environments – nearly thirty-eight million pieces a year.

Materials that have not degraded can also serve as shelter for invasive species, such as tube worms and barnacles. When the ecosystem changes in response to the invasive species, resident species and the natural balance of resources, genetic diversity, and species richness is altered. These factors may support local economies in way of hunting and aquaculture, which suffer in response to the change. Similarly, coastal communities which rely heavily on ecotourism lose revenue thanks to a buildup of pollution, as their beaches or shores are no longer desirable to travelers. The World Trade Institute also notes that the communities who often feel most of the effects of poor biodegradation are poorer countries without the means to pay for their cleanup. In a positive feedback loop effect, they in turn have trouble controlling their own pollution sources.

== Etymology of &quot;biodegradable&quot; ==
The first known use of &quot;biodegradable&quot; in a biological context was in 1959 when it was employed to describe the breakdown of material into innocuous components by microorganisms. Now &quot;biodegradable&quot; is commonly associated with environmentally friendly products that are part of the earth&#x27;s innate cycles like the carbon cycle and capable of decomposing back into natural elements.

<text>Biomass is the mass of living biological organisms in a given area or ecosystem at a given time. Biomass can refer to &quot;species biomass&quot;, which is the mass of one or more species, or to &quot;community biomass&quot;, which is the mass of all species in the community. It can include microorganisms, plants or animals. The mass can be expressed as the average mass per unit area, or as the total mass in the community.

How biomass is measured depends on why it is being measured. Sometimes, the biomass is regarded as the natural mass of organisms &quot;in situ&quot;, just as they are. For example, in a salmon fishery, the salmon biomass might be regarded as the total wet weight the salmon would have if they were taken out of the water. In other contexts, biomass can be measured in terms of the dried organic mass, so perhaps only 30% of the actual weight might count, the rest being water. For other purposes, only biological tissues count, and teeth, bones and shells are excluded. In some applications, biomass is measured as the mass of organically bound carbon (C) that is present.

In 2018, Bar-On et al. estimated the total live biomass on Earth at about 550 billion (5.5×1011) tonnes C, most of it in plants. In 1998 Field et.al. estimated the total annual net primary production of biomass at just over 100 billion tonnes C/yr. The total live biomass of bacteria was once thought to be about the same as plants, but recent studies suggest it is significantly less. The total number of DNA base pairs on Earth, as a possible approximation of global biodiversity, is estimated at , and weighs 50 billion tonnes. Anthropogenic mass (human-made material) is expected to exceed all living biomass on earth at around the year 2020.

==Ecological pyramids==

An ecological pyramid is a graphical representation that shows, for a given ecosystem, the relationship between biomass or biological productivity and trophic levels.
* A &quot;biomass pyramid&quot; shows the amount of biomass at each trophic level.
* A &quot;productivity pyramid&quot; shows the production or turn-over in biomass at each trophic level.

An ecological pyramid provides a snapshot in time of an ecological community.

The bottom of the pyramid represents the primary producers (autotrophs). The primary producers take energy from the environment in the form of sunlight or inorganic chemicals and use it to create energy-rich molecules such as carbohydrates. This mechanism is called primary production. The pyramid then proceeds through the various trophic levels to the apex predators at the top.

When energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next, typically only ten percent is used to build new biomass. The remaining ninety percent goes to metabolic processes or is dissipated as heat. This energy loss means that productivity pyramids are never inverted, and generally limits food chains to about six levels. However, in oceans, biomass pyramids can be wholly or partially inverted, with more biomass at higher levels.

==Terrestrial biomass==
Terrestrial biomass generally decreases markedly at each higher trophic level (plants, herbivores, carnivores). Examples of terrestrial producers are grasses, trees and shrubs. These have a much higher biomass than the animals that consume them, such as deer, zebras and insects. The level with the least biomass are the highest predators in the food chain, such as foxes and eagles.

In a temperate grassland, grasses and other plants are the primary producers at the bottom of the pyramid. Then come the primary consumers, such as grasshoppers, voles and bison, followed by the secondary consumers, shrews, hawks and small cats. Finally the tertiary consumers, large cats and wolves. The biomass pyramid decreases markedly at each higher level.

Changes in plant species in the terrestrial ecosystem can result in changes in the biomass of soil decomposer communities. Biomass in C3 and C4 plant species can change in response to altered concentrations of CO2. C3 plant species have been observed to increase in biomass in response to increasing concentrations of CO2 of up to 900 ppm.

==Ocean biomass==

Ocean or marine biomass, in a reversal of terrestrial biomass, can increase at higher trophic levels. In the ocean, the food chain typically starts with phytoplankton, and follows the course:

Phytoplankton → zooplankton → predatory zooplankton → filter feeders → predatory fish


Phytoplankton are the main primary producers at the bottom of the marine food chain. Phytoplankton use photosynthesis to convert inorganic carbon into protoplasm. They are then consumed by zooplankton that range in size from a few micrometers in diameter in the case of protistan microzooplankton to macroscopic gelatinous and crustacean zooplankton.

Zooplankton comprise the second level in the food chain, and includes small crustaceans, such as copepods and krill, and the larva of fish, squid, lobsters and crabs.

In turn, small zooplankton are consumed by both larger predatory zooplankters, such as krill, and by forage fish, which are small, schooling, filter-feeding fish. This makes up the third level in the food chain.

A fourth trophic level can consist of predatory fish, marine mammals and seabirds that consume forage fish. Examples are swordfish, seals and gannets.

Apex predators, such as orcas, which can consume seals, and shortfin mako sharks, which can consume swordfish, make up a fifth trophic level. Baleen whales can consume zooplankton and krill directly, leading to a food chain with only three or four trophic levels.

Marine environments can have inverted biomass pyramids. In particular, the biomass of consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) is larger than the biomass of primary producers. This happens because the ocean&#x27;s primary producers are tiny phytoplankton which are r-strategists that grow and reproduce rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of primary production. In contrast, terrestrial primary producers, such as forests, are K-strategists that grow and reproduce slowly, so a much larger mass is needed to achieve the same rate of primary production.

Among the phytoplankton at the base of the marine food web are members from a phylum of bacteria called cyanobacteria. Marine cyanobacteria include the smallest known photosynthetic organisms. The smallest of all, &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot;, is just 0.5 to 0.8 micrometres across. In terms of individual numbers, Prochlorococcus is possibly the most plentiful species on Earth: a single millilitre of surface seawater can contain 100,000 cells or more. Worldwide, there are estimated to be several octillion (1027) individuals. &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; is ubiquitous between 40°N and 40°S and dominates in the oligotrophic (nutrient poor) regions of the oceans. The bacterium accounts for an estimated 20% of the oxygen in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and forms part of the base of the ocean food chain.

==Bacterial biomass==
Bacteria and archaea are both classified as prokaryotes, and their biomass is commonly estimated together. The global biomass of prokaryotes is estimated at 30 billion tonnes C, dominated by bacteria.

The estimates for the global biomass of prokaryotes had changed significantly over recent decades, as more data became available. A much-cited study from 1998 collected data on abundances (number of cells) of bacteria and archaea in different natural environments, and estimated their total biomass at 350 to 550 billion tonnes C. This vast amount is similar to the biomass of carbon in all plants. The vast majority of bacteria and archaea were estimated to be in sediments deep below the seafloor or in the deep terrestrial biosphere (in deep continental aquifers). However, updated measurements reported in a 2012 study reduced the calculated prokaryotic biomass in deep subseafloor sediments from the original ≈300 billion tonnes C to ≈4 billion tonnes C (range 1.5–22 billion tonnes). This update originates from much lower estimates of both the prokaryotic abundance and their average weight.

A census published in PNAS in May 2018 estimated global bacterial biomass at ≈70 billion tonnes C, of which ≈60 billion tonnes are in the terrestrial deep subsurface. It also estimated the global biomass of archaea at ≈7 billion tonnes C. A later study by the Deep Carbon Observatory published in 2018 reported a much larger dataset of measurements, and updated the total biomass estimate in the deep terrestrial biosphere. It used this new knowledge and previous estimates to update the global biomass of bacteria and archaea to 23–31 billion tonnes C. Roughly 70% of the global biomass was estimated to be found in the deep subsurface. The estimated number of prokaryotic cells globally was estimated to be 11–15 × 1029. With this information, the authors of the May 2018 PNAS article revised their estimate for the global biomass of prokaryotes to ≈30 billion tonnes C, similar to the Deep Carbon Observatory estimate.

These estimates convert global abundance of prokaryotes into global biomass using average cellular biomass figures that are based on limited data. Recent estimates used an average cellular biomass of about 20–30 femtogram carbon (fgC) per cell in the subsurface and terrestrial habitats.

==Global biomass==
The total global biomass has been estimated at 550 billion tonnes C. A breakdown of the global biomass is given by kingdom in the table below, based on a 2018 study by Bar-On et. al.
 Animals represent less than 0.5% of the total biomass on Earth, with about 2 billion tonnes C in total. Most animal biomass is found in the oceans, where arthropods, such as copepods, account for about 1 billion tonnes C and fish for another 0.7 billion tonnes C. Roughly half of the biomass of fish in the world are mesopelagic, such as lanternfish, spending most of the day in the deep, dark waters. Marine mammals such as whales and dolphins account for about 0.006 billion tonnes C.

Land animals account for about 500 million tonnes C, or about 20% of the biomass of animals on Earth. Terrestrial arthropods account for about 150 million tonnes C, most of which is found in the topsoil. Land mammals account for about 180 million tonnes C, most of which are humans (about 80 million tonnes C) and domesticated mammals (about 90 million tonnes C). Wild terrestrial mammals account for only about 3 million tonnes C, less than 2% of the total mammalian biomass on land.
Most of the global biomass is found on land, with only 5 to 10 billion tonnes C found in the oceans. On land, there is about 1,000 times more plant biomass (&quot;phytomass&quot;) than animal biomass (&quot;zoomass&quot;). About 18% of this plant biomass is eaten by the land animals. However, marine animals eat most of the marine autotrophs, and the biomass of marine animals is greater than that of marine autotrophs.

According to a 2020 study published in &quot;Nature&quot;, human-made materials, or technomass, outweigh all living biomass on earth, with plastic alone exceeding the mass of all land and marine animals combined.

==Global rate of production==
Net primary production is the rate at which new biomass is generated, mainly due to photosynthesis. Global primary production can be estimated from satellite observations. Satellites scan the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) over terrestrial habitats and scan sea-surface chlorophyll levels over oceans. This results in 56.4 billion tonnes C/yr (53.8%) for terrestrial primary production and 48.5 billion tonnes C/yr for oceanic primary production. Thus, the total photoautotrophic primary production for the Earth is about 104.9 billion tonnes C/yr. This translates to about 426 gC/m2/yr for land production (excluding areas with permanent ice cover) and 140 gC/m2/yr for the oceans.

However, there is a much more significant difference in standing stocks—while accounting for almost half of the total annual production, oceanic autotrophs account for only about 0.2% of the total biomass.

Terrestrial freshwater ecosystems generate about 1.5% of the global net primary production.

<doc id="47497" wikidata="Q430178" url="?curid=47497" title="Doctor Doom">
<text>Doctor Doom is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; #5 in July 1962, and has endured as the archenemy of the superhero team the Fantastic Four.

In the Marvel Universe, Victor von Doom is the monarch of the European country of Latveria. He uses his expertise in both science and magic in pursuit of his goals to bring order to humanity through world domination, and prove his intellectual superiority over Mister Fantastic–his college rival and the leader of the Fantastic Four–whom he blames for his disfigurement. Although he primarily comes into conflict with the Fantastic Four, Doom has also fought other superheroes, including Spider-Man, Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Black Panther, the X-Men, and the Avengers. Doom was ranked #4 by &quot;Wizard&quot; on its list of the 101 Greatest Villains of All Time and #3 on IGN&#x27;s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time. In a later article, IGN would declare Doom as Marvel&#x27;s greatest villain.

The character has been adapted in various media incarnations, including films, television series, and video games. Joseph Culp, Julian McMahon, and Toby Kebbell have portrayed Doom in live-action, while Paul Dobson, Clive Revill, Lex Lang, and others have provided his voice in animation and video games. Robert Downey Jr. will portray the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films &quot;&quot; (2026) and &quot;&quot; (2027).

==Publication history==
===Creation and development===
Like many of Marvel&#x27;s Silver Age characters, Doom was conceived by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. With the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; title performing well, Lee and Kirby were trying to dream up a &quot;soul-stirring...super sensational new villain&quot; for the series. Looking for a name, Lee latched onto &quot;Doctor Doom&quot; as &quot;eloquent in its simplicity — magnificent in its implied menace.&quot;

Due to the rush to publish, the character was not given a full origin story until &quot;Fantastic Four Annual&quot; #2, two years after his debut.

In a 1987 interview, Kirby commented on Doctor Doom&#x27;s design. &quot;Dr. Doom was the classic conception of Death, of approaching Death. I saw Dr. Doom as The Man in the Iron Mask, who symbolized approaching Death. It was the reason for the armor and the hood. Death is connected with armor and inhuman-like steel. Death is something without mercy and human flesh contains that element of mercy. Therefore, I had to erase it, and I did it with a mask.&quot;

Kirby further described Doom as being &quot;paranoid&quot;, wrecked by his twisted face and wanting the whole world to be like him. Kirby went on to say that &quot;Doom is an evil person, but he&#x27;s not always been evil. He was [respected]...but through a flaw in his own character, he was a perfectionist.&quot; At one point in the 1970s, Kirby drew his interpretation of what Doom would look like under the mask, giving Doom only &quot;a tiny scar on his cheek&quot;. Due to this slight imperfection, Doom hides his face not from the world, but from himself. To Kirby, this is the motivation for Doom&#x27;s vengeance against the world; because others are superior due to this slight scar, Doom wants to elevate himself above them. Stan Lee&#x27;s writing typically showed Doom&#x27;s arrogance as his constant downfall, and how his pride leads to von Doom&#x27;s disfigurement at the hands of his own machine, and to the failures of many of his schemes.

While the Fantastic Four had fought various villains such as the Mole Man, Skrulls, the Miracle Man, and Namor the Sub-Mariner, Doom managed to overshadow them all and became the Fantastic Four&#x27;s archnemesis. During the 1970s, Doom branched out to more Marvel titles such as &quot;Astonishing Tales&quot;, &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, and &quot;Super-Villain Team-Up&quot; (1975). Beginning with issue #42, he also had appearances in &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; (February 1976). Doom&#x27;s origin was also a feature in &quot;Astonishing Tales&quot; when his ties to the villain Mephisto were revealed.

In the book &quot;Superhero: The Secret Origin of a Genre&quot;, Peter Coogan writes that Doom&#x27;s original appearance was representative of a change in the portrayal of &quot;mad scientists&quot; to full-fledged villains, often with upgraded powers. These supervillains are genre-crossing villains who exist in adventures &quot;in a world in which the ordinary laws of nature are slightly suspended&quot;; characters such as Professor Moriarty, Count Dracula, Auric Goldfinger, Hannibal Lecter, Joker, Lex Luthor, and Darth Vader, also fit this description. Sanderson also found traces of William Shakespeare&#x27;s characters Richard III and Iago in Doom; all of them &quot;are descended from the &#x27;vice&#x27; figure of medieval drama&quot;, who address the audience in monologs detailing their thoughts and ambitions.

===1980s–1990s===
In 1976, Marvel and DC Comics collaborated on &quot;Superman vs. the Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, and seeking to replicate that success the two companies again teamed the characters in &quot;Superman and Spider-Man&quot; in 1981. Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter co-wrote the story with Marv Wolfman, and recalled choosing Victor von Doom based on his iconic status: &quot;I figured I needed the heaviest-duty bad guy we had to offer — Doctor Doom. Their greatest hero against our greatest villain.&quot;

In 1981 John Byrne began his six-year run writing and illustrating &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, sparking a &quot;second golden age&quot; for the title but also attempting to &quot;turn the clock back [...] get back and see fresh what it was that made the book great at its inception.&quot; Doctor Doom made his first appearance under Byrne&#x27;s tenure with issue #236. Whereas Kirby had intimated that Doom&#x27;s disfigurement was more a figment of Victor&#x27;s vain personality, Byrne decided that Doom&#x27;s face was truly ravaged: only Doom&#x27;s own robot slaves are allowed to see the monarch without his helmet. Byrne emphasized other aspects of Doom&#x27;s personality; despite his ruthless nature, Victor von Doom is a man of honor. Returning to Latveria after being temporarily deposed, Doctor Doom abandons a scheme to wrest mystical secrets from Doctor Strange in order to oversee his land&#x27;s reconstruction. Despite a tempestuous temper, Doom occasionally shows warmth and empathy to others; he tries to free his mother from Mephisto and treats Kristoff Vernard like his own son. Byrne gave further detail regarding Doom&#x27;s scarring: Byrne introduced the idea that the accident at Empire State University only left Victor with a small scar that was exaggerated into a more disfiguring accident by Doom&#x27;s own arrogance—by donning his newly forged face mask before it had fully cooled, he caused massive irreparable damage.

After his debut, Doctor Doom remained a key villain in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; throughout the 1980s, appearing in titles as &quot;Punisher&quot;, &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot;, and &quot;Excalibur&quot;. During Steven Englehart&#x27;s run on &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, Doom was exiled by his heir, Kristoff, but this storyline was left unresolved when Englehart departed. Walt Simonson&#x27;s &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #350 controversially revealed that the Doom seen during Englehart&#x27;s arc was a robotic imposter, with the real Doom returning in new armor to reclaim Latveria. Simonson&#x27;s retcon suggested the last true appearance of Doom was in the &quot;Battle of the Baxter Building,&quot; but later writers often disregarded his interpretations, leading to further revisions of Doom&#x27;s character and history.

===2000s–2010s===
Mark Waid began to redefine Doctor Doom in the 2003 &quot;Unthinkable&quot; storyline (&quot;Fantastic Four&quot; vol. 3, #66-70 and #500), where Doom forsakes technology for mysticism. He kills his first love, Valeria, to gain powers from demons and imprisons Franklin Richards in Hell. Doom challenges Reed Richards to escape a magical prison, but with Doctor Strange&#x27;s help, Richards succeeds, causing Doom to be dragged to Hell. Doom remained there until the 2004 &quot;Ragnarok&quot; storyline in &quot;Thor&quot;, where Thor&#x27;s hammer, Mjolnir, provided his escape. In 2005–2006, Doctor Doom starred in the limited series &quot;Books of Doom&quot;, written by Ed Brubaker. This retelling of his origin explored the early, less-seen parts of Doom&#x27;s life and questioned whether his path to dictatorship was fated or due to personal faults—a nature versus nurture debate. Brubaker&#x27;s portrayal was influenced by the original Lee/Kirby version, and he chose not to show Doom&#x27;s face, following Kirby&#x27;s example.

In &quot;Spider-Man/Fantastic Four&quot; #4, the Mighty Avengers invaded Latveria due to Victor&#x27;s involvement in a chemical bomb plot involving the Venom symbiote, which was actually orchestrated by Kristoff Vernard. In the &quot;Siege&quot; storyline, Doctor Doom initially supports Norman Osborn&#x27;s attack on Asgard but later withdraws. He also stars in &quot;Doomwar&quot; written by Jonathan Maberry, where he allies with the isolationist Desturi to seize control of Wakanda.

In &quot;Fantastic Four: Three&quot;, Doctor Doom seeks to be &quot;reborn&quot; and plans to abdicate his throne to Kristoff. Valeria von Doom visits him, notices his brain damage, and offers to restore his mental capacity in exchange for his help with Reed and the Fantastic Four. A humbled Doom later attends Johnny Storm&#x27;s funeral, and is recommended for the Future Foundation. Leading up to &quot;Secret Wars&quot;, Doom usurps the power of the Beyonders, creating a new Battleworld where he assumes the role of God. However, Reed Richards and a group of heroes challenge Doom, and with the Molecule Man&#x27;s help, they restore the multiverse. Reed ultimately uses the Beyonder&#x27;s power to heal Doom&#x27;s face and purify his soul.

Doom returns to his kingdom, saving Tony Stark from Latverian rebels and claiming to be a new man. He relinquishes his dictatorship, entrusting Tony with a Wand of Watoomb to defeat Madame Masque. When more rebels appear, he teleports Stark to the Bronx Zoo, and they later confront Madame Masque in Chicago. After discovering she&#x27;s possessed, Doom helps Tony trap her in his armor and exorcises the demon. He then vanishes before Tony wakes up. Doom later interrupts Tony&#x27;s breakfast with Amara, trying to prove he has changed, but Tony remains distrustful. Following Stark&#x27;s coma caused by Captain Marvel, Doom takes up the Iron Man mantle, faces Mephisto disguised as the Maker, joins the Avengers, and eventually conceives a child with Dr. Amara Perera.

When Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm seek their teammates to restore the Fantastic Four&#x27;s powers, Doom follows them into parallel universes to assist an alternate Reed Richards against a version of Doom who has merged with Galactus. Meanwhile, Gwenpool, unaware of Doom&#x27;s reformation, tries to attack him using an AI Doombot named Vincent. Doom easily captures her but is amused by her taunts. Gwen escapes, believing Doom is still a threat, and attacks again, releasing an earlier version of Doom. Doom defeats his doppelganger to save Gwen, who realizes her mistake and hopes for reform. Later, she enlists Doom, Vincent, Doctor Strange, and Terrible Eye to help her friend Cecil regain human form.

Doctor Doom was featured in his first solo series in 2019. Doom is framed for a Moon space station explosion he had warned about, while also experiencing random encounters with rival supervillain Kang the Conqueror due to a theorized quantum entanglement.

==Fictional character biography==

Victor von Doom was born in Latveria to a tribe of Romani people under the rule of an unnamed nobleman, the Baron. His mother, the witch Cynthia von Doom, died at the hands of Mephisto when Victor was young. His father, Werner von Doom, a renowned medicine man, kept her sorcery a secret to protect Victor. After Cynthia&#x27;s death, the Baron&#x27;s wife fell ill, and when Werner failed to save her, he was labeled a murderer and forced to flee with young Victor. Werner ultimately died of exposure on a mountainside, leaving Victor to discover his mother&#x27;s occult instruments and swear revenge on the Baron. As Victor grew, he became a brilliant inventor, merging sorcery and technology to defend the Roma people. His exploits attracted the attention of the dean of Empire State University, who offered him a chance to study in the U.S., prompting Victor to leave his homeland and his love, Valeria, behind.

Upon arriving in the United States, Victor von Doom met Reed Richards, his future rival. He built a machine to communicate with the dead, specifically his mother, but ignored Richards’ warnings about its flaws, leading to a catastrophic explosion that severely damaged his face. Expelled after the incident, Victor traveled until he collapsed on a Tibetan mountainside, where he was rescued by monks. Mastering their disciplines, he forged an iron mask that permanently bonded to his skin, adopting the identity of Doctor Doom. As Doom, he sought revenge on those he held responsible for his accident, particularly Reed Richards, and successfully led a revolution to take over Latveria, focusing on the welfare of the Roma.

===1960s===
In his first appearance, Doctor Doom captures the Invisible Girl, using her as a hostage to force the Fantastic Four to travel back in time to steal Blackbeard&#x27;s enchanted treasure to help him conquer the world. However, Reed Richards tricks Doom by swapping the treasure for worthless chains. Doom then allies with the Sub-Mariner, who installs a magnetic device in the Baxter Building to pull them into space, aiming to eliminate the Fantastic Four. The Sub-Mariner returns the Baxter Building to New York, leaving Doom stranded on an asteroid. After learning the secrets of the advanced Ovids, Doom swaps consciousnesses with Mister Fantastic but accidentally switches back, ending up trapped in Sub-Atomica when hit by a shrinking ray he intended for the Fantastic Four. Doom takes over this micro-world but is ousted by the Fantastic Four and thrown into space while trying to send them there. Saved by Rama-Tut, he returns to Earth and uses a special berry juice to turn the Fantastic Four against each other. However, Richards outsmarts Doom with the hallucinogenic juice, leading Doom to believe he has killed him and depart. During the 1960s, Doom attempted to recruit Spider-Man into joining forces with him, and he came into conflict with the Avengers when Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch illegally entered Latveria to find a long-lost relative of theirs. He stole the Silver Surfer&#x27;s powers in 1967, but lost them after breaching a barrier Galactus had set for the Surfer on Earth.

===1970s and 1980s===
During the 1970s, Doctor Doom expanded into more Marvel titles, featuring a battle for the Latverian throne against Prince Rudolfo in &quot;Astonishing Tales&quot;. In August 1981, he appeared in &quot;Iron Man&quot;, where Stark thwarted Doom&#x27;s time-travelling plan to enlist Morgan le Fay to defeat King Arthur&#x27;s forces with an army of revived warriors. Stranded in the past due to this interference, Doom vowed revenge, but he had to postpone it to return to the present day.

Doctor Doom later allies with the Puppet Master to trap the Fantastic Four in the miniature city of &quot;Liddleville,&quot; using cybernetic copies of their bodies. However, he sabotages the plan to disrupt Reed&#x27;s focus, but the Puppet Master ultimately aids the FF in escaping, trapping Doom in the android body he used to monitor them.

During John Byrne&#x27;s 1980s run, Doctor Doom attempted to steal Terrax the Tamer&#x27;s cosmic powers, leading to a fight that destroyed his body. He survived by transferring his consciousness to another human and was later restored to his original body by the Beyonder. On Battleworld, Doom briefly succeeded in stealing the Beyonder&#x27;s power, but it was too vast for him to control, allowing the Beyonder to reclaim it.

===1990s===
When Franklin Richards was kidnapped by Onslaught, Doctor Doom joined forces with the Fantastic Four, Avengers and the X-Men to battle him in Central Park. During the fight, Doom was forced to sacrifice himself alongside others to contain Onslaught, which allowed the X-Men to destroy him. Though believed dead, Doom and the heroes were saved by Franklin, who created a pocket dimension called Counter-Earth, where Doom later uncovered a secret power linked to Franklin and persuaded the boy to relinquish control of the world.

===2000s===
When Susan Richards faced complications with her second pregnancy, Johnny Storm contacted Doctor Doom for help, knowing he couldn&#x27;t resist the chance to outdo Reed. Doom saved Susan&#x27;s daughter and cured Johnny&#x27;s inability to &quot;flame off&quot; by channeling Johnny&#x27;s excess energy into her. Afterward, Doom named the baby &quot;Valeria&quot; and plotted to make her his familiar, seeking to sacrifice his long-lost love for magical powers equivalent to years of sorcery study. With this power, he trapped Franklin in Hell, immobilized Doctor Strange, and neutralized the Fantastic Four. However, Reed freed Doctor Strange&#x27;s astral self, allowing them to outsmart Doom and provoke his demonic benefactors to take him to Hell.

To eliminate Doom as a threat, Reed took control of Latveria to dismantle his equipment, and planned to trap them both in a pocket dimension. This backfired when the team intervened, leading Doom to transfer his spirit into Sue, Johnny, and Ben. Reed was forced to kill Ben to stop Doom. Doom returned to Hell, and Reed later used a machine Doom had once created to travel to Heaven and restore Ben to life. Doom remained in Hell until he escaped during a dimensional tear caused by Mjolnir&#x27;s fall to Earth, though he focused on rebuilding his power base instead of lifting the hammer. These events were later removed from Marvel continuity in the 2015 &quot;Secret Wars&quot;.

Later, a Doombot was defeated by Reed Richards, Hank Pym, Iron Man, and She-Hulk in New York City, raising questions about Doom&#x27;s involvement. In the midst of the superhero Civil War, he sends a message to Storm and the Black Panther, inviting an alliance between Latveria and Wakanda. In Latveria, Panther spurns the invitation, detonating an EMP that blacked out a local portion of Latveria before Doctor Doom&#x27;s robots could destroy his ship. It is later revealed that Doom is working with the Red Skull on a weapon, believing it would lead him to become the Baron of Iron, despite his disagreements with the Skull&#x27;s principles.

At the end of the first chapter of the X-Men event &quot;Endangered Species&quot;, Doom is contacted by Beast to help reverse the effects of Decimation but rejects the offer, admitting he lacks talent in genetics. In &quot;Spider-Man: One More Day&quot;, Doom is approached by Spider-Man for help in saving Aunt May. Additionally, he transforms Latveria into a refugee camp for Atlanteans after the destruction of their kingdom, and allies with Loki to manipulate his brother into unwittingly releasing his Asgardian allies.

Doctor Doom later defends Latveria against the Mighty Avengers after it is revealed that one of his satellites carried the &#x27;Venom Virus&#x27; released in New York City, a result of hacking by one of Doom&#x27;s enemies. During a battle with Iron Man and the Sentry, the time travel mechanism in his armor overloads, trapping them all in the past; Doom continues his relationship with Morgan le Fay using his time machine. Although he and Iron Man eventually return to the present, Doom leaves Iron Man in his exploding castle and is falsely incarcerated at The Raft. He later escapes the Raft in the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; storyline, thanks to a virus was uploaded into the prison&#x27;s systems by the Skrulls. After the Secret Invasion and the onset of &quot;Dark Reign,&quot; Doctor Doom joined the Cabal with Norman Osborn, Emma Frost, Namor, Loki&#x27;s female form, and the Hood, seeking revenge for his tarnished reputation.

Soon after, he allies with the isolationist Desturi to seize control of Wakanda. Doom severely injures T&#x27;Challa, the Black Panther, aiming to take Wakanda&#x27;s vibranium for his own enhancement. However, T&#x27;Challa destroys the vibranium stockpile, believing his people can survive without it. In &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #566-569, written by Mark Millar, Doctor Doom receives a power upgrade after being thrown back in time by the Marquis of Death. He fights through time to seek revenge, claiming to have rebuilt himself to destroy the Marquis. However, later issues ignore this arc, suggesting it was merely a dream of Valeria von Doom. Doom then joins the supervillain group Intelligencia but is betrayed and captured during their plan. He escapes with Bruce Banner&#x27;s help and returns to Latveria, seemingly damaged by the experience.

===2010s===
At the start of the &quot;Siege&quot; storyline, Doom, working with the Cabal, demands that Osborn reverse his actions against Namor, but Osborn refuses. After a violent attack by the Void, it&#x27;s revealed that the &quot;Doctor Doom&quot; present was actually a Doombot, which releases nanites that destroy Avengers Tower and force evacuations. The real Doom warns Osborn not to strike him again, threatening further consequences.

It&#x27;s revealed that the Scarlet Witch at Wundagore Mountain is a Doombot, indicating that the real Wanda was captured by Doom after the House of M event. Wanda&#x27;s enhanced powers resulted from her and Doom&#x27;s attempt to channel the Life Force to resurrect her children, which ultimately overwhelmed her. With Wiccan&#x27;s help, they sought to use the entity possessing Wanda to restore mutant powers, but the Young Avengers intervened, concerned about the consequences. Doom aimed to transfer this entity into himself, gaining god-like powers, but accidentally killed Cassie before Wanda and Wiccan could reclaim those powers from him.

In &quot;Fantastic Four: Three,&quot; a guilt-ridden Doctor Doom, planning to abdicate his throne to Kristoff, is approached by Valeria, who asks for his help with her father. Noticing Doom&#x27;s brain damage and memory loss from a previous battle, she offers to restore his mental faculties in exchange for assisting with the Fantastic Four, which he agrees to. Later, Doom attends Johnny Storm&#x27;s funeral. Due to this agreement, Doom is recommended by Nathaniel and Valeria von Doom to join the Future Foundation. Despite an angry attack from the Thing, Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman welcome him. Valeria learns that Kristoff Vernard is Doom&#x27;s backup for restoring his memories, so they all head to Latveria, where a brain transfer machine successfully restores Doom&#x27;s knowledge. Although Kristoff offers to return the throne to Doom, he declines, citing a promise to Valeria to help her defeat Mister Fantastic when needed. Doom then plans a symposium to defeat the Council of Reeds—alternate versions of Reed Richards trapped in their universe. Mister Fantastic, Victor, Valeria, and Nathaniel Richards meet with the supervillain geniuses and Uatu the Watcher about what to do with the Council of Reeds.

Around this time, von Doom performed brain surgery on the Hulk to separate him from Bruce Banner, extracting the uniquely Banner elements from the Hulk&#x27;s brain and cloning a new body for Banner, in return for a favor from the Hulk. This clone is killed soon afterward. Later, Doom is apparently killed by the Mad Celestials. With no knowledge as to how he survived, Doom awakens in the ruins of the Interdimensional Council of Reeds, where Valeria had left him a present: the full army of lobotomized Doctor Dooms from alternate realities who were previously captured by the council, along with two Infinity Gauntlets from alternate universes. With these resources, Doom created the Parliament of Doom, an interdimensional council charged with maintaining peace across the multiverse. He later returned to again rule Latveria, upon ruling the council for a millennium. An ill-fated excursion into the alternate universe of the one of Infinity Gauntlets resulted in Reed and Nathaniel Richards rescuing Doom from his own council.

During the confrontation between the Avengers and the X-Men, Doom allies with Magneto and others against Red Skull&#x27;s Red Onslaught form. In an attempt to atone for past misdeeds, Doom absorbs the Scarlet Witch reality-altering powers and resurrects the dead Cassie Lang, whom he had accidentally killed. He subsequently makes a Faustian deal with an unspecified demon to resurrect Brother Voodoo. After returning to normal, Doom is taken into captivity for his initial killing of Lang.

As the final Incursion approaches in the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, Doom usurps the power of the Beyonders with the aid of Doctor Strange and the Molecule Man. He then creates a new Battleworld from the destroyed multiverse, claiming the role of God, and rewriting history to resurrect those he killed, while taking Sue as his wife and assigning roles to Franklin and Valeria. Ultimately, Reed and a group of survivors challenge Doom, and with Molecule Man&#x27;s help, they restore the multiverse. Reed chooses to heal Doom&#x27;s face using the Beyonder&#x27;s power.

In the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot;, Doom returns to Latveria and saves Tony Stark by using a sonic attack to incapacitate a group of rebels. He tells Tony he&#x27;s a new man and gives him one of the Wands of Watoomb for protection against Madame Masque. When more rebels arrive, Doom teleports Iron Man to the Bronx Zoo, then to the Jackpot Club in Chicago to confront a Masque. Realizing she is demonically possessed, Doom has Tony trap her in the Iron Man armor while he exorcises the demon. He disappears before Tony regains consciousness, then later interrupts Tony&#x27;s breakfast date with Amara to prove he has changed, but Tony remains distrustful and Doom leaves again, not without a little smooch though.

After Tony Stark&#x27;s defeat by Captain Marvel in &quot;Civil War II&quot;, Doom discovers his calling to heal the world, reflecting on his dissatisfaction as a god. Inspired by Stark, he establishes Stark&#x27;s legacy, fights for his brand of justice as the third Iron Man, and later conflicts with Mephisto disguised as Maker. Doom joins the Avengers and conceives a child with Dr. Amara Perera, prompting a group of villains led by the Hood to target him. The final battle occurs when the Hood tries to take over Stark Industries, leading to a confrontation between Doom and the Hood, during which Doom&#x27;s face is severely burned by a demon. After the villains&#x27; defeat, Victor retreats to the ruins of Castle Doom.

A young woman named Zora Vokuvic breaks into Castle Doom, demanding to see Doctor Doom and insisting that Latveria needs its leader back amid turmoil. Initially resistant, Doom is persuaded when Zora hands him his iconic mask, prompting him to venture out and quell the civil war, vowing to restore the nation with his own strength.

===2020s===
Doctor Doom is framed for the destruction of the Antlion space station by Symkarian rebels and is killed while on the run, only to be sent back to Earth by Death as her &quot;greatest servant.&quot; After fending off assassins including Taskmaster and MODOK, he sends Reed Richards his solution to the black hole threatening Earth and sets off to regain his power. During the &quot;King in Black&quot; storyline, Doctor Doom confronts Iron Man during Knull&#x27;s invasion. Iron Man is bonded with an Extremis-powered Symbiote, and they are attacked by a Symbiote-possessed Santa Claus, revealed to be Mike Dunworthy. Doom seeks to learn from Iron Man&#x27;s new armor, but is turned down, leaving him to ponder whether Santa Claus could be a Sorcerer Supreme.

During the &quot;Blood Hunt&quot; storyline, Doctor Doom puts Latveria on high alert amidst a vampire invasion, ordering border guards to maintain defenses while noting he will have new subjects to attend to. He later approaches Strange Academy students in Madripoor after the disappearance of Agatha Harkness and the Living Darkhold. At the Latverian embassy in Alberia, Doom saves Tatiana Keska from vampires, despite knowing she has grievances against him. Doctor Doom informs Doctor Strange and Clea that Blade is possessed by Varnae and declares they need mages to bring back the Sun, requesting the title of Sorcerer Supreme. After being temporarily granted the title, he casts a spell that removes the Darkforce surrounding Earth, which inadvertently allows vampires to walk in sunlight. However, he then betrays his promise and refuses to return the title, making Doctor Strange disappear.

In the &quot;Venom War&quot; storyline, Doctor Doom encountered Flexo and provided him with tactics for dealing with Eddie Brock in his King in Black form. This proves useful when Flexo severely injured Eddie Brock at the Grand Garden Arena.

==Powers and abilities==
Doctor Doom is a polymath and inventor with genius-level intellect, renowned for creating doomsday machines and robots, particularly his Doombots, which he can control technopathically. Throughout his history, he has been depicted as one of the most intelligent humans in the Marvel Universe, notably restoring the Thing&#x27;s human form—though Reed Richards also achieved this, he struggled to maintain it. However, Richards managed to process complex calculations to save Kitty Pryde from disintegration, a feat Doom admitted he could not replicate. Additionally, Doom has leveraged his scientific prowess to steal or replicate the powers of beings like the Silver Surfer, the Beyonder, and even Galactus&#x27;s world-ship. Doom often uses &quot;Doombots,&quot; his robot doubles, to retroactively explain his actions or erase events from his history. This device was also used to depict Kristoff Vernard believing himself to be the real Doom for a time.

In addition to being a genius scientist and inventor, Doom is a powerful sorcerer, initially trained by Tibetan monks and later enhanced by his lover, Morgan le Fay. He possesses abilities such as energy absorption, lightning manipulation, dimensional travel, healing, and summoning demonic creatures. Doom placed second in a magic tournament held by the ancient sorcerer the Aged Genghis, and after Doctor Strange relinquished the title of Sorcerer Supreme, he acknowledged Doom&#x27;s potential to assume that role. This mastery of magic gives Doom a unique advantage over his intellectual rival, Reed Richards, who lacks knowledge of sorcery.

The alien Ovoids inadvertently taught Doctor Doom how to psionically transfer his consciousness into another being through eye contact, a technique he uses to frequently escape. However, he rarely employs this ability, as it can revert if his concentration breaks, and he is reluctant to do so due to his ego about his appearance.

Doom&#x27;s armor enhances his strength and durability to superhuman levels, allowing him to contend with powerful foes like Spider-Man and the Hulk, although he prefers long-range tactics against stronger opponents. The armor is nearly indestructible, shielding him from various forms of manipulation and housing advanced weaponry, including lasers, a force field generator, and lethal electric shocks. Additionally, his armor supports him with air, food, water, and energy systems for extended periods in extreme environments such as outer space. Even without the armor, Doom is a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, capable of defeating strong opponents due to his knowledge of pressure points and skill with melee weapons.

=== Monarch of Latveria ===
As the absolute monarch of Latveria, Doctor Doom rules the country with an iron fist and has frequently used his political power for his own personal benefit. Doom has reshaped the country in his own image, renaming both the capital city Hassenstadt and Castle Sabbat to Doomstadt and Castle Doom respectively. Doom frequently monitors the citizens of Latveria from Castle Doom and uses his Doombots to maintain order within his nation. Despite his infamous reputation as a supervillain, Doom has diplomatic immunity – allowing him to escape legal prosecution for most of his crimes he commits outside of Latveria. Doom also has total control of the nation&#x27;s natural and technological resources, along with its manpower, economy, and military. Though from the outside it seems tyrannical, it seems the Latverian people really do adore Doom, as shown with two of his apprentices, Zora Vukovic, (aka, Victorious) and Kristoff Vernard. He is also known to harbor fugitive supervillains within Latveria as means of protecting them from prosecution, although he only does this for villains who play a part in his schemes. After renouncing his rulership, it is likely he lost this status.

===Psychology===

Doom&#x27;s primary weakness is his arrogance, which often blinds him to his own role in his failures. Layla Miller noted that he refuses to accept responsibility for the accident that scarred his face, instead blaming Reed Richards. While Doom typically views himself as superior, he occasionally listens to heroes like Mister Fantastic when it benefits him. Even when allied with others, he often seeks personal gain, as seen when he attempted to steal Thanos’ Infinity Gauntlet during a confrontation with the Titan. Doom adheres to a strict code of honor, keeping his word but often interpreting promises in a self-serving way. For instance, while he may not harm someone directly, he won&#x27;t stop others from doing so. His sense of honor has led him to save Captain America and spare Spider-Man&#x27;s life, but he refuses to attack weakened opponents, preferring that any victory over the Fantastic Four come solely from him. Despite his flaws, Doom is devoted to his subjects. When judged by the Panther God of Wakanda, it is revealed that Doom truly wished for a utopian future where humanity thrived, albeit one where he was in power.

==Inventions==
Doctor Victor von Doom&#x27;s genius in science and technology has allowed him to build numerous devices to handle enemies or acquire greater power. The most notable among them include:

* Doombots - Doombots have the face of the real Doctor Doom but with no hood and have guns. They are used for many missions, typically those where he fears defeat, thus functioning as his version of a Life Model Decoy. The Doombots are programmed to believe themselves to be the real Doctor Doom unless they are in his presence.
* Servo-Guards - Robots that are programmed to attack the enemies of Doom.
* Time Platform - Doctor Doom&#x27;s time machine features a 10-by-10-foot platform and a control console, allowing transport to any point in Earth&#x27;s timestream. He can return on his own using his armor&#x27;s time circuitry, and one such machine was captured by the Fantastic Four, who used it to send Godzilla back in time.
* A device to imbue people with superpowers.

== Cultural influence and legacy ==

=== Critical reception ===
&quot;UGO Networks&quot; stated that Doctor Doom is an iconic figure in Marvel comics, known for his &quot;iron mask and emerald cowl,&quot; along with his formidable armor and army of Doombots.

* A ride called &quot;Doctor Doom&#x27;s Fearfall&quot; is located at Islands of Adventure in the Universal Orlando Resort.

==Other versions==
===1602===

In Neil Gaiman&#x27;s alternative-universe tale, &quot;Marvel 1602&quot;, Dr. Doom is &quot;Count Otto von Doom&quot;, also known as &quot;Otto the Handsome&quot;. A mastermind genius of physics and even genetics, von Doom keeps the Four of the Fantastick imprisoned in his castle, continually tapping Richard Reed for knowledge. The Four eventually escape during an attack on Doom&#x27;s castle by the other heroes of the time, which also leads to the scarring of his face.

Otto von Doom returns in &quot;1602: The Fantastick Four&quot;, in which he plans to visit a city beyond the edge of the world, believing they have knowledge that could restore his face. He kidnaps William Shakespeare to record these events.

===Age of Apocalypse===

In the Age of Apocalypse, Victor von Doom is an agent of the Human High Council and the Head of Security. His facial scar is the result of a mutant uprising in Latveria.

Doctor Doom made an appearance in Marvel UK&#x27;s &quot;Combat Colin&quot; strip. A superheroes convention is attacked by the robotic Steamroller Man. After Combat Colin and his sidekick Semi-Automatic Steve defeats the robot, its controller is revealed to be Doctor Doom, who explains that after years of being defeated by American superheroes he thought (wrongly) he could stand a chance against some incompetent Brits. The final panel shows Doom back in his lair, surrounded by newspaper cuttings detailing his past defeats and wondering how he would do in a fight with Thomas the Tank Engine.

===Doom Supreme===
In an alternate reality, Doctor Doom, known as Doom Supreme, became a master of dark arts after losing his beloved Valeria, using her remains to forge his armor through sacrifice. He also sacrificed alternate versions of himself to power his armor and intimidated others into allegiance, claiming to be &quot;the Doom who breaks other Dooms.&quot;

Doom Supreme, after witnessing a battle between the Prehistoric Avengers and a younger Thanos, is advised by Mephisto to form a new Masters of Evil from the worst villains in the Multiverse to conquer it, saving Earth-616 for last. He assembles a powerful group, including Black Skull, Dark Phoenix, and her Berserkers, Ghost Goblin, Kid Thanos, and King Killmonger. They attack various Earths, eventually arriving on Earth-616, where he defeats Orb and sends his team to fight the Avengers. After a climactic battle at Avengers Mountain, where it explodes, Doom Supreme enhances his power by placing a fragment of the Watcher&#x27;s eye into his own.

Doom Supreme interacts with a version of Doctor Doom called Doom-Thing. When Doom-Thing threatens him, Doom Supreme subdues him and explains that he collects alternate versions of Doctor Doom, leading Doom-Thing to swear allegiance to him while tasked with cleaning up his mess.

Doom Supreme arrives on Earth-616 after Agamotto breaks up the Avengers&#x27; fight with the Prehistoric Avengers, removes Agamotto&#x27;s eyes, and kills the Prehistoric Star Brand as the Multiversal Masters of Evil arrive.

As most of the Multiversal Masters of Evil are defeated, Dark Phoenix confronts Doom Supreme, only to discover he&#x27;s just a hologram on Doom the Living Planet, surrounded by his loyal Doctor Doom variants. Doom Supreme arrives at the God Quarry, instructing his variants to hold off the Multiversal Avengers while he casts a spell to claim rights to all existence. During the battle, Avenger Prime, revealed to be a variation of Loki, joins the fray.

As the Multiversal Avengers battle the Doctor Doom variants, Doom Supreme begins turning the air into acid, he is confronted by Avenger Prime and Namor. Old Man Phoenix and Echo use their powers to make Doom the Living Planet bleed molten blood, injuring the Doctor Doom variants.

Amidst the chaos, Avenger Prime breaks off from fighting Doom Supreme due to news of a Celestial-sized Mephisto attacking. Ka-Zar and an alternate Galactus join the fight, while Gorilla-Man and Ursa Major decimate the Doctor Doom variants. As Doom Supreme confronts Dark Phoenix, claiming to have awaited her, they share a tense moment before he turns against Mephisto. Ultimately, the Multiversal Avengers regroup, and apprehend the remaining Doctor Doom variants.

===Earth-111===
In this reality, visited by Ben Grimm while attempting to recover the coordinates of the Ultimate Nullifer, divided between the subconscious minds of four alternative Johnny Storms, Doom was the leader of the &#x27;Challengers of Doom&#x27; consisting of himself, Reed Richard, Sue Storm, and the Hulk-, with Latveria having been destroyed in an unspecified past disaster and Doom relocating to New York to become a hero. When Galactus came to Earth and landed in Russia, Doom dismissed it as a hoax, prompting Grimm to note that this Doom was more arrogant than the version he knew as the Doom of Earth-616 was at least willing to listen to even his enemies if the situation was serious enough rather than dismiss their views as automatically irrelevant.

===Earth-1191===
Unlike most Dooms this version is portrayed as an old, senile man with delusions of retaining his old authority and physique- seen by Layla Miller as a natural &#x27;evolution&#x27; of Doom&#x27;s inability to accept that &quot;he&quot; might be the reason for his failures-, although with periods of lucidity in which, while physically decrepit, he is still as smart and devious (and in turn, dangerous) as ever. Currently he&#x27;s been taken in by Layla Miller and Madrox who hope that he can aid them in traveling back to their present. After finding and reactivating a time machine provided by the future X-Men, Doom, while in another lucid moment, betrays them, ordering the time traveling &quot;Cortex&quot; to use his abilities to &quot;Destroy all the mutants&quot;. Doom also is able to take control of the heavily cyberized Cyclops though his cybernetic implants, forcing Cyclops&#x27; daughter Ruby to take him down. After this battle, Doom vanishes.

===Earth-691===
In the alternate 31st century of the original Guardians of the Galaxy, designated as Earth-691, Doom is revealed to have somehow managed to place his brain inside the adamantium skeleton of Wolverine at some unknown point in the past, hiding this fact with a perfect replica of his original armor, cloak, hood, and simulated flesh intended to give the appearance that he has managed to prolong his life to unnatural lengths. He eventually comes face to face with Rancor, a descendant of Wolverine, and offers to become her ally, though he secretly intended to use her as a pawn for his own gain, while she intends to slay him on her quest to determine what happened to Wolverine. During their battle, Doom reveals himself to be in control of Wolverine&#x27;s skeleton, heavily modified with cybernetics and missing half of one of the claws, which had eventually come into the possession of Rancor. Rancor manages to strike at one of Doom&#x27;s robotic eyes, forcing him to retreat. Doom is not seen again in this reality.

===Earth-X===
In the dystopian future of Earth-X, Doctor Doom has killed the Invisible Woman and Human Torch, but died in the process. Reed Richards took his place as ruler of Latveria and also wears his armor.

===House of M===

In the &quot;House of M&quot; continuity, Doom rules Latveria, with his mother alive, married to Valeria, and having adopted Kristoff. After Reed Richards&#x27;s test flight results in the deaths of Reed, Sue, and John Jameson from cosmic radiation, Ben Grimm survives but loses his intelligence. This prompts Doom to form the Fearsome Four with himself, the It (Grimm), the Invincible Woman (Valeria), and the Inhuman Torch (Kristoff). However, due to Doom&#x27;s arrogance and brutality, the It betrays the team, leading to the deaths of Valeria and Kristoff, and his mother&#x27;s kidnapping. Left broken, Doom genetically mutates himself, transforming his skin into liquid metal and gaining the ability to form weapons from his hands as he prepares for revenge.

===Iron Man 2093===
In an alternative future set in 2093, where a reborn King Arthur rules a renewed Camelot, Doom and Iron Man are drawn to stop a plan to destroy most of Earth&#x27;s population. While Iron Man battles his descendant wielding Excalibur, Doom confronts his future self, who has allied with the future Iron Man to complete a sinister plan. Rejecting his future counterpart, Doom asserts that no amount of power justifies such an affront to his dignity, then kills the older Doom, suggesting a stable time loop where the younger Doom will always defeat his future self.

=== Marvel Mangaverse ===
In &quot;Marvel Mangaverse&quot;, Doom makes T&#x27;Channa, T&#x27;Challa&#x27;s sister, his disciple, she banishes him to another dimension and assumes the identity of Doctor Doom.

This universe&#x27;s Doctor Doom saved Earth by transferring his mind into Galactus, with the result that Earth has been spared but Doom&#x27;s hunger for power has led him to devour every other planet in the universe. With the help of alternate counterparts of Reed Richards and Emma Frost from an undesignated universe, they are able to defeat him by transferring his mind into Emma Frost&#x27;s body, while she becomes the Life Bringer.

===Marvel Universe vs the Avengers===
Weeks after a pathogen has turned most of Earth&#x27;s population into homicidal cannibals, Dr. Doom aids the Avengers in repelling the infected and offers them Doom Stones to prevent further transformations, but demands absolute loyalty in return. Most Avengers reluctantly accept, while Thor returns to Asgard; however, they later discover that the stones do not halt the infection but enhance cognitive function in the cannibals and accelerate the transformation process. Hawkeye uncovers Doom&#x27;s infection and, after Doom activates the stones&#x27; harmful effects, he is ultimately killed by Hawkeye with an arrow tipped with Wolverine&#x27;s severed adamantium claws.

===Marvel Zombies vs. The Army Of Darkness===
In more of an anti-hero role, the Earth-2149 version of Doom is still ruler of Latveria. Doom has fortified his castle to defend against the infected superheroes and refuses help from Nick Fury, and takes in refugees for the purpose of repopulating the planet once the situation is resolved. To the disgust of his allies, it is revealed Doom has only chosen the hardiest breeding stock of the Latverian survivors; there are no elderly people or children. He creates a makeshift portal that will allow escape into other dimensions, should the zombie plague doom the planet. Doom is forced to vaporize the mutant Dazzler and the zombified Enchantress after the latter infects the former, but is then attacked by the zombified Marvel superheroes and infected by Reed Richards, who had infected himself and his teammates on purpose.

Shortly before he turns, a &quot;dying&quot; Doom heroically uses his portal to allow the refugees escape to another reality. Despite his defenses, the zombies breaks through once more. With only himself and Ash Williams remaining, he reveals he has been infected by the virus, and cannot go through the portal himself. Though tempted to eat Ash, he resists, as he considers Ash to have allowed him revenge against Reed Richards, allowing the man to escape, even giving him the ability to choose one of many realities. As Ash escapes through it, Doom ultimately destroys the device, trapping himself with the zombies. Having witnessed Doom saving the refugees by using his portal for their escape, the zombified Thing suddenly attacked Doom. He is later seen in New York, as a zombie who attempts to devour Galactus before engaging in battle with the zombified superheroes who succeeded in absorbing Galactus&#x27; cosmic powers before him, presumably being killed by them off-screen.

===MC2===

In the Fantastic Five series set in the MC2, Doom is revealed to be held captive by the Sub-Mariner for ten years, after the destruction of Atlantis. Doom manages to escape, and uses the same device he once employed to imbue Terrax with the Power Cosmic on his Doombots- unable to use it on himself as his human body would be destroyed from the strain-, and attempts to take over the world. Taking advantage of Doom&#x27;s desire to prove himself superior, Reed Richards challenges Doom to a psychic duel, using a device that will send the loser&#x27;s mind to the Crossroads of Infinity. The two are so evenly matched that both are sent to the Crossroads - although Namor notes that it is possible that Reed sacrificed himself to try to save Doom - leaving their bodies as empty shells, although Reed&#x27;s teammates note that there is always a possibility that the two shall return so long as their bodies remain alive.

===Mini-Marvels===
Doctor Doom makes shortly cameos in Mini-Marvels. In the &quot;Classic Mini Marvels&quot; section, there&#x27;s a short story about him in which he tries to read Marvel&#x27;s comics. He can be seen in &quot;Civil Guards&quot; as one of the doctors that are experimenting with Spider-Man&#x27;s body. The Avengers also have a photo of Doom in their house, as shown in &quot;World War Hulk&quot;.

===Mutant X===
In the Mutant X universe, Doom leads the United Nations in battle against the Goblyn Queen and later the Beyonder.

An alternate of Doom with the powers of Charles Xavier is a superhero and leader of his own X-Men.

===Old Man Logan===
In the alternative Wolverine-centric future shown on Earth-807128, the supervillains of the Marvel universe finally won and divided America (later renamed Amerika) up amongst themselves. Doctor Doom has his own area of land called New Latveria (also called Doom&#x27;s Lair). He is seen for only a few panels dressed in all gray standing atop a cliff watching a now old Logan and Hawkeye driving the Spider Buggy built by the Human Torch. It is revealed that Clyde Wyncham has taken on the role of Doom.

On Earth-21923 that was similar to Earth-807128, Doctor Doom&#x27;s history is still the same. After Old Man Logan killed Red Skull and Hulk, a power vacuum was caused in Amerika which led to Doctor Doom taking over the Presidential Quarter. At one point during his takeover of the Presidential Quarter, he came across a village that was established by Baron Mordo. When Doctor Doom cut off Baron Mordo&#x27;s access to Agatha Harkness, he killed Baron Mordo, took the Darkhold that was in his possession, and freed Sofia Strange and those enslaved to Mordo. In addition, he allowed Agatha to leave with her life while stating that she owes him. When asked by Sofia on what he plans to do with the Darkhold, Doctor Doom states that he is going to use it to rule.

===Old Woman Laura===
In an alternate timeline, Doom gathered most of the supervillains on Earth into an army, attempting to conquer the world. When his &quot;soldiers&quot; were defeated and imprisoned, Doom retreated to Latveria, creating an impenetrable forcefield over the whole country. Decades later, Wolverine receives word that Doom is holding her clone sister Bellona prisoner, and leads a covert attack to take Doom out once and for all. Doom manages to capture Laura, revealing that he deliberately leaked the intel that drove her to attack. He attempts to transfer his mind into Laura&#x27;s body in order to escape his own decrepit form, only to discover that Laura is herself dying. Doom returns to his own body, but is killed by Laura immediately after.

===Spider-Man: Life Story===
In &quot;Spider-Man: Life Story&quot; a reality in which the Marvel superheroes aged in real time and started their careers the same year as their publication, Doctor Doom has taken over Earth as a result of the Civil War between Captain America and Iron Man and a resistance being formed to combat him composed of those that didn&#x27;t die or disappear entirely.

===&quot;The End&quot;===
In Alan Davis&#x27; mini-series, Fantastic Four: The End, Dr. Doom appears as a four-armed cyborg with little of his humanity left. Doom breaks during the &quot;mutant wars&quot; and is now a killing machine, focused on the deaths of the Fantastic Four. He engages in a final battle with the Four and is seemingly killed in an explosion when his powers react with those of Franklin and Valeria Richards. Doom is later revealed to be alive and conquers the Negative Zone after killing Annihilus and obtaining his power rod and immortality.

===&quot;The Last Fantastic Four Story&quot;===
Dr. Doom is seen trying to destroy the Adjudicator, however he and his robotic planes are shown to disintegrate and he is last seen cheering the Fantastic Four (even though he will find a way to destroy them). How he survived remains unknown.

===Ultimate Marvel===

In the Ultimate Marvel universe, Victor Van Damme, a descendant of Vlad Tepes Dracula, is part of the Baxter Building think tank alongside Reed Richards and Susan Storm. He secretly reprograms a teleporter&#x27;s coordinates, causing the accident that gives the Ultimate Fantastic Four their powers and transforms him into a metallic-skinned figure with clawed hands and goat-hooved legs. When he learns of their transformation, he derides Reed as a &quot;freak,&quot; believing himself to be the only one worthy of such power.

For a time, Doom leads a micronation in Copenhagen known as &quot;Free State,&quot; where citizens live rent-free in exchange for loyalty and receive dragon tattoos that serve as mind control devices. The Fantastic Four eventually liberate the citizens during their first battle, but they cannot imprison Doom due to his diplomatic immunity. During the Namor fiasco, it was revealed that the mother of Sue and Johnny Storm possesses a similar dragon tattoo. After the collapse of the Keep, Doom returned to Latveria and transformed it from a Third World nation into the ninth-richest country in the world within six months. Although the citizens, now bearing Doom&#x27;s dragon tattoos, revere him as &quot;the good doctor,&quot; their loyalty comes at a cost. Meanwhile, Doom switches bodies with Reed Richards to claim a life he believes is rightfully his, leaving Reed in control of Latveria while he seeks recognition by saving Johnny Storm from an alien parasite. Despite Reed&#x27;s efforts to combat the zombie Fantastic Four, Doom ultimately reverts their bodies and defeats the threat himself.

Doom seems to reappear in issue six of &quot;Ultimate Power&quot;, seeking control over the Supremeverse, but is revealed in issue eight to be a Doombot. Later, in &quot;Ultimates 3,&quot; he is shown controlling Ultron, though he lacks his distinctive goat legs and resembles his 616 counterpart, with the reason for this change yet to be explained. The Thing supposedly killed Victor in his Latverian home as retribution for Doom&#x27;s causing the events of &quot;Ultimatum&quot;; however&#x27; Doom later reveals that while in the zombie universe he had Sue and Johnny Storm&#x27;s mother, Mary Storm, in disguise ruling in his absence. This was who The Thing unknowingly killed. The Ultimate version of Reed Richards appears to have taken over the role of Doctor Doom.

More recently, the Parliament of Doom (an organization constituted by numerous Doctor Dooms of alternative universes led by the Victor von Doom of Earth-616) fought the Fantastic Four in an alternative past of Earth-616, being one of the Doctor Dooms present very similar to Ultimate Doctor Doom, with features such as goat-hooved legs. It is yet unknown if that Doctor Doom is in fact from the Ultimate Universe or an alternative version of that reality.

Following the events of &quot;Cataclysm&quot;, Phil Coulson and Danny Ketch reveal that the real Victor (who once again has his goat-hooved legs) was being held captive by S.H.I.E.L.D. before it disbanded. He is released and forced to join the Future Foundation alongside Invisible Woman, Falcon, and Tony Stark.

When the time-displaced young X-Men are transferred into the Ultimate Marvel universe by accident, Doom captures and brainwashes the younger Beast to serve him, requiring the displaced X-Men to join forces with the new Ultimate Spider-Man and the Ultimate Marvel X-Men to rescue him.

Later, it is revealed that Doom teamed up with Hydra to &quot;save&quot; the world from corrupt governments, capturing Miles Morales and Jessica Drew to exploit their DNA for a super soldier army. However, Miles unexpectedly taps into a hidden power, defeating Doom and Hydra, just as another Earth&#x27;s image appears in the sky.

Ultimate Doom is a scientific genius who views science as an art, having transformed his body into solid metal and gained powers similar to Colossus, including the ability to expel his internal organs as poisonous gas and regenerate, though he cannot heal wounds inflicted by his own spikes. He exhibits super strength and can launch metal spikes from his forearms, making him formidable enough to break the arms of a zombie version of Ben Grimm. The Ultimate Universe&#x27;s Doom is also an accomplished sorcerer.

===Venomverse===
In Venomverse, Doom was consumed by the Poisons and became their second in command after Poison Thanos. He with the other Poison Heroes started battling the Army of Venoms in which he was the only survivor. Then the Poisons tried to invade Earth-616, he and Thanos along with the other Poisons got killed, after the Poison Queen was destroyed.

===Warlock===
On the original Counter Earth, Victor von Doom is a genius, but not a villain. He appears in the original &quot;Warlock&quot; series. Von Doom&#x27;s armor is now represented only by the metallic mask and the green hood/cape is gone. He is referred to as &quot;the most famous egghead in the country&quot;, the &quot;like spirit-brother&quot; of Reed Richards, and &quot;a man as dedicated to counter-Earth&#x27;s survival as Earth&#x27;s von Doom is to its enslavement&quot;.

He and Reed Richards are mentioned in passing in &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; #2 and &quot;Warlock&quot; #2 as scientists without any sort of super-powers.
In &quot;Warlock&quot; #6, it is told how von Doom and Richards had been roommates, friends and lab partners in college. After von Doom&#x27;s disfiguring accident, Richards&#x27; emotional support prevented him from becoming a villain. When Richards and his three companions hijacked a spaceship in order to be the first humans in space, von Doom unsuccessfully attempted to talk him out of it. Though all of the counter &quot;fantastic four&quot; were exposed to cosmic radiation, it was only Richards that was affected due to the interference of Man-Beast though the effects only became apparent ten years later when he became the Brute due to &quot;latent cosmic radiation - and a mysterious guiding hand&quot;.

In &quot;Warlock&quot; #5-7, Victor von Doom was employed at the Livermore Valley Lab in California where he worked on &quot;Earth-Corer-1&quot;, a vehicle designed to tunnel into the Earth. He warned the president of a massive earthquake that would be caused by a nuclear bomb test. The resulting earthquake accidentally activated &quot;Antipersonnel missiles, nicknamed deathbirds&quot; which began killing people indiscriminately. Von Doom was able to destroy them with Adam Warlock&#x27;s help, using one of his inventions called the &quot;deactivator&quot;. He died while helping Adam Warlock stop the Brute from absorbing all of Counter-Earth&#x27;s geothermal energy, turning him back into Reed Richards.

===What If?===
There are some &quot;What If&quot; stories revolving around Doctor Doom:

* In &quot;What If Doctor Doom had become a Hero?&quot;, Victor Doom heeds Reed Richards&#x27; warnings, successfully using his machine to free his mother from Hell and becoming a hero who liberates Latveria. However, when Mephisto traps his nation and demands a soul for a soul, Doom sacrifices Valeria, choosing ambition over love, and spends his future fighting demons to reclaim her.
* In &quot;What If Doctor Doom Were Sorcerer Supreme?&quot; a young Victor von Doom seeks the Ancient One to harness his magical potential, but his ambition leads to deadly rivalries with fellow student Mordo. Ultimately, the Ancient One attempts to curtail Doom&#x27;s growing power by taking him to Mephisto&#x27;s realm, where Doom dies but transfers his memories into Stephen Strange, shaping the future of magic.
* In &quot;What if Doctor Doom had Become the Thing?&quot;, a scheming Victor von Doom sabotages Reed Richards&#x27; rocket project to further his own ambitions, ultimately using armor that amplifies cosmic rays and transforms him into the Thing. After a confrontation with Reed and the emergence of a hulk-like Ben Grimm, Doom is defeated and forced to retreat, facing the consequences of his manipulations.
* In &quot;What If: Secret Wars,&quot; Doctor Doom, after defeating the Beyonder, eliminates Inhumans, Eternals and the remaining superheroes and establishes a utopia on Earth. After a lengthy battle with the Celestials, he restores Earth and reintroduces himself as &quot;Victor,&quot; stepping back to guide humanity rather than rule over it.
* In &quot;&quot;What If: Iron Man: Demon in an Armor&quot;,&quot; Doctor Doom, after transferring his mind into Tony Stark&#x27;s body, uses Stark&#x27;s identity to build his own reputation while Stark, amnesic and believing himself to be Doom, creates a new life. Their eventual confrontation reveals the truth, but Stark refuses to switch back, having forged his own honorable identity despite Doom&#x27;s actions.

===King Loki===
In the future depicted in &quot;Loki: Agent of Asgard&quot;, Doctor Doom discovers Latveria completely destroyed after King Loki destroyed the Earth. Doom attempts to prevent this future by imprisoning the Loki of the present.

===Ultimate Universe===
In Earth-6160, a world marked by alternate history due to the interference of the Maker, Latveria is an independent territory close to the European Coalition and used as his seat of political power, as he reshapes the global status quo, eroding national identities and independence in favor of a new world order, creating a Council composed of leaders of regional power blocs and creating a permanent war economy between their territories, while they operate covertly as a group, keeping their local populations controlled as a worldwide form of shadow government.

It is shown through Howard Stark&#x27;s history files that the Maker arrived in 1963, establishing the futuristic enclave known as &quot;The City&quot; at Latveria, showcasing himself as a force of progress to the world and performing feats such as taking care of external threats like Galactus and performing a moon landing. He is regarded as an Imperator, or the de facto ruler of the Earth, due to being regarded as the only one capable of keeping the public safe from global threats and disseminating technological advances on a regular base, using the organization H.A.N.D as a secret police. As Stark rebels against the Maker, he imprisons both of them and Kang inside the city, leaving two years before it opens.

===King Thor===
In King Thor&#x27;s timeline, Doom acquired the powers of Iron Fist, Ghost Rider, Star Brand and Doctor Strange. He wanted to destroy the new mortals that appeared in a desolate Earth, but he got attacked by King Thor and Old Man Phoenix. During the battle, he killed Logan, which allowed the Phoenix Force to go to Thor right before Doom was about to use his Penance Stare to Thor. Now with the power of the Phoenix Force, Thor was able to defeat Doom.

<doc id="47498" wikidata="Q54" url="?curid=47498" title="All your base are belong to us">
<text>&quot;All your base are belong to us&quot; is an Internet meme based on a poorly translated phrase from the opening cutscene of the Japanese video game &quot;Zero Wing&quot;. The phrase first appeared on the European release of the 1991 Sega Mega Drive / Genesis port of the 1989 Japanese arcade game. 

By the early 2000s, a GIF animation depicting the opening text became widespread on web forums. A music video accompanied by a techno remix of the clip, originally posted on the comedy forum Newgrounds, gained popularity and became a derivative Internet meme in its own right. The original meme has been referenced many times in media outside of the forums.

==&quot;Zero Wing&quot; transcript==
Below are some other examples of text as it appeared in the poorly translated English release, alongside a more accurate translation from the original Japanese. 
==History==

&quot;Zero Wing&quot; was released in Japanese arcades by developer Toaplan on 1 July 1989, and in North America in April 1990. The European release of the game on the Sega Mega Drive, also known as the Sega Genesis, which contained the script of the meme&#x27;s origin, occurred in July 1991.

&quot;Zero Wing&quot; is one of the most widely known examples of poor linguistic translation in video games. Translations were handled internally by the design team, not with a professional translator. According to game designer Tatsuya Uemara, the English skills of the team member who prepared the translations were &quot;really terrible&quot;.

The first references of the meme could be seen in 1999 and the early 2000s when an animated GIF of the scene appeared on forums and sites like Zany Video Game Quotes, OverClocked, and TribalWar forums. In November 2000, Kansas City computer programmer and part-time disc jockey Jeffrey Ray Roberts (1977–2011), of the gabber band The Laziest Men on Mars, made a techno dance track, &quot;Invasion of the Gabber Robots,&quot; which remixed some of the &quot;Zero Wing&quot; video game music with a voice-over of the phrase, &quot;All your base are belong to us&quot;. (The original music for &quot;Zero Wing&quot; was written by Tatsuya Uemura and arranged by Noriyuki Iwadare.) On 16 February 2001, user Bad_CRC posted an animated music video accompanying the song onto the Flash game and animation sharing site Newgrounds. The video was shared rapidly, soon becoming an Internet meme and receiving widespread media attention. The meme&#x27;s popularity was seen throughout the early 2000s when it was broadcast unauthorized onto the ticker of a Raleigh, North Carolina, TV channel, used as a placeholder message by YouTube while under maintenance, and reproduced onto T-shirts.

The meme was addressed by Toaplan representatives Tatsuya Uemura (programmer and music composer of &quot;Zero Wing&quot; and Toaplan founding member) and Masahiro Yuge (fellow Toaplan composer and founder) in interviews during the 2010s. Uemura stated that the poor English translation in the Mega Drive version was handled by a member of Toaplan in charge of export and overseas business.

The 15th and 20th anniversaries of the posting of the remix on Newgrounds were recognized by numerous culture sites. The meme has been highlighted for its uniqueness in that, unlike other memes of the time, it lacked sexual innuendos or vulgarity.

==Mentions in media==

The phrase or some variation of lines from the game has appeared numerous times in films, commercials, news broadcasts, other games, and social media posts.

On 1 April 2003, in Sturgis, Michigan, seven people placed signs through the town that read: &quot;All your base are belong to us. You have no chance to survive make your time.&quot; They claimed to be playing an April Fools&#x27; joke, but most people who saw the signs were unfamiliar with the phrase. Many residents were upset that the signs appeared while the US was at war with Iraq, and police chief Eugene Alli said the signs could be &quot;a borderline terrorist threat, depending on what someone interprets it to mean&quot;.

In February 2004, North Carolina State University students and members of TheWolfWeb in Raleigh, North Carolina, exploited a web-based service used by local schools and businesses to report weather-related closures to display the phrase within a news ticker on a live news broadcast on News 14 Carolina.

On 1 June 2006, the phrase &quot;All Your Video Are Belong to Us&quot; appeared in all-caps below the YouTube logo as a placeholder while YouTube was under maintenance. Some users believed the site had been hacked, leading YouTube to add the message &quot;No, we haven&#x27;t be hacked. Get a sense of humor.&quot;

On 19 January 2019, American Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) tweeted &quot;All your base (are) belong to us&quot; in response to a poll by &quot;Hill-HarrisX&quot; indicating that 45% of the Republicans who were polled approved of Ocasio-Cortez&#x27;s suggested implementation of a 70% marginal tax rate for individual income over $10 million per year.

<doc id="47501" wikidata="Q4538627" url="?curid=47501" title="Brightness temperature">
<text>Brightness temperature or radiance temperature is a measure of the intensity of electromagnetic energy coming from a source. In particular, it is the temperature at which a black body would have to be in order to duplicate the observed intensity of a grey body object at a frequency formula_1.
This concept is used in radio astronomy, planetary science, materials science and climatology.

The brightness temperature provides &quot;a more physically recognizable way to describe intensity&quot;.

When the electromagnetic radiation observed is thermal radiation emitted by an object simply by virtue of its temperature, then the actual temperature of the object will always be equal to or higher than the brightness temperature. Since the emissivity is limited by 1, the brightness temperature is a lower bound of the object’s actual temperature.

For radiation emitted by a non-thermal source such as a pulsar, synchrotron, maser, or a laser, the brightness temperature may be far higher than the actual temperature of the source. In this case, the brightness temperature is simply a measure of the intensity of the radiation as it would be measured at the origin of that radiation. 

In some applications, the brightness temperature of a surface is determined by an optical measurement, for example using a pyrometer, with the intention of determining the real temperature. As detailed below, the real temperature of a surface can in some cases be calculated by dividing the brightness temperature by the emissivity of the surface. Since the emissivity is a value between 0 and 1, the real temperature will be greater than or equal to the brightness temperature. At high frequencies (short wavelengths) and low temperatures, the conversion must proceed through Planck&#x27;s law.

The brightness temperature is not a temperature as ordinarily understood. It characterizes radiation, and depending on the mechanism of radiation can differ considerably from the physical temperature of a radiating body (though it is theoretically possible to construct a device which will heat up by a source of radiation with some brightness temperature to the actual temperature equal to brightness temperature). 

Nonthermal sources can have very high brightness temperatures. In pulsars the brightness temperature can reach 1030 K. For the radiation of a helium–neon laser with a power of 1 mW, a frequency spread Δf = 1 GHz, an output aperture of 1 mm, and a beam dispersion half-angle of 0.56 mrad, the brightness temperature would be .

For a black body, Planck&#x27;s law gives:
formula_2
where formula_3 (the Intensity or Brightness) is the amount of energy emitted per unit surface area per unit time per unit solid angle and in the frequency range between formula_1 and formula_5; formula_6 is the temperature of the black body; formula_7 is the Planck constant; formula_1 is frequency; formula_9 is the speed of light; and formula_10 is the Boltzmann constant.

For a grey body the spectral radiance is a portion of the black body radiance, determined by the emissivity formula_11.
That makes the reciprocal of the brightness temperature:
formula_12

At low frequency and high temperatures, when formula_13, we can use the Rayleigh–Jeans law:
formula_14
so that the brightness temperature can be simply written as:
formula_15

In general, the brightness temperature is a function of formula_1, and only in the case of blackbody radiation it is the same at all frequencies. The brightness temperature can be used to calculate the spectral index of a body, in the case of non-thermal radiation.

== Calculating by frequency ==
The brightness temperature of a source with known spectral radiance can be expressed as:
formula_17

When formula_13 we can use the Rayleigh–Jeans law:
formula_19

For narrowband radiation with very low relative spectral linewidth formula_20 and known radiance formula_21 we can calculate the brightness temperature as:
formula_22

== Calculating by wavelength ==
Spectral radiance of black-body radiation is expressed by wavelength as:
formula_23

So, the brightness temperature can be calculated as:
formula_24

For long-wave radiation formula_25 the brightness temperature is:
formula_26

For almost monochromatic radiation, the brightness temperature can be expressed by the radiance formula_21 and the coherence length formula_28:
formula_29

==In oceanography==

In oceanography, the microwave brightness temperature, as measured by satellites looking at the ocean surface, depends on salinity as well as on the temperature and roughness (e.g. from wind-driven waves) of the water.

<doc id="47502" wikidata="Q736777" url="?curid=47502" title="Calibration">
<text>In measurement technology and metrology, calibration is the comparison of measurement values delivered by a device under test with those of a calibration standard of known accuracy. Such a standard could be another measurement device of known accuracy, a device generating the quantity to be measured such as a voltage, a sound tone, or a physical artifact, such as a meter ruler.

The outcome of the comparison can result in one of the following:

* no significant error being noted on the device under test
* a significant error being noted but no adjustment made
* an adjustment made to correct the error to an acceptable level

Strictly speaking, the term &quot;calibration&quot; means just the act of comparison and does not include any subsequent adjustment.

The calibration standard is normally traceable to a national or international standard held by a metrology body.

==BIPM Definition==
The formal definition of calibration by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) is the following: &quot;Operation that, under specified conditions, in a first step, establishes a relation between the quantity values with measurement uncertainties provided by measurement standards and corresponding indications with associated measurement uncertainties (of the calibrated instrument or secondary standard) and, in a second step, uses this information to establish a relation for obtaining a measurement result from an indication.&quot;
This definition states that the calibration process is purely a comparison, but introduces the concept of measurement uncertainty in relating the accuracies of the device under test and the standard.

==Modern calibration processes==
The increasing need for known accuracy and uncertainty and the need to have consistent and comparable standards internationally has led to the establishment of national laboratories. In many countries a National Metrology Institute (NMI) will exist which will maintain primary standards of measurement (the main SI units plus a number of derived units) which will be used to provide traceability to customer&#x27;s instruments by calibration.

The NMI supports the metrological infrastructure in that country (and often others) by establishing an unbroken chain, from the top level of standards to an instrument used for measurement. Examples of National Metrology Institutes are NPL in the UK, NIST in the United States, PTB in Germany and many others. Since the Mutual Recognition Agreement was signed it is now straightforward to take traceability from any participating NMI and it is no longer necessary for a company to obtain traceability for measurements from the NMI of the country in which it is situated, such as the National Physical Laboratory in the UK.

===Quality of calibration===
To improve the quality of the calibration and have the results accepted by outside organizations it is desirable for the calibration and subsequent measurements to be &quot;traceable&quot; to the internationally defined measurement units. Establishing traceability is accomplished by a formal comparison to a standard which is directly or indirectly related to national standards (such as NIST in the USA), international standards, or certified reference materials. This may be done by national standards laboratories operated by the government or by private firms offering metrology services.

Quality management systems call for an effective metrology system which includes formal, periodic, and documented calibration of all measuring instruments. ISO 9000 and ISO 17025 standards require that these traceable actions are to a high level and set out how they can be quantified.

To communicate the quality of a calibration the calibration value is often accompanied by a traceable uncertainty statement to a stated confidence level. This is evaluated through careful uncertainty analysis.
Some times a DFS (Departure From Spec) is required to operate machinery in a degraded state. Whenever this does happen, it must be in writing and authorized by a manager with the technical assistance of a calibration technician.

Measuring devices and instruments are categorized according to the physical quantities they are designed to measure. These vary internationally, e.g., NIST 150-2G in the U.S. and NABL-141 in India. Together, these standards cover instruments that measure various physical quantities such as electromagnetic radiation (RF probes), sound (sound level meter or noise dosimeter), time and frequency (intervalometer), ionizing radiation (Geiger counter), light (light meter), mechanical quantities (limit switch, pressure gauge, pressure switch), and, thermodynamic or thermal properties (thermometer, temperature controller). The standard instrument for each test device varies accordingly, e.g., a dead weight tester for pressure gauge calibration and a dry block temperature tester for temperature gauge calibration.

==Instrument calibration prompts==
Calibration may be required for the following reasons:
* a new instrument
* after an instrument has been repaired or modified
* moving from one location to another location
* when a specified time period has elapsed
* when a specified usage (operating hours) has elapsed
* before and/or after a critical measurement
* after an event, for example
** after an instrument has been exposed to a shock, vibration, or physical damage, which might potentially have compromised the integrity of its calibration
** sudden changes in weather
* whenever observations appear questionable or instrument indications do not match the output of surrogate instruments
* as specified by a requirement, e.g., customer specification, instrument manufacturer recommendation.

In general use, calibration is often regarded as including the process of adjusting the output or indication on a measurement instrument to agree with value of the applied standard, within a specified accuracy. For example, a thermometer could be calibrated so the error of indication or the correction is determined, and adjusted (e.g. via calibration constants) so that it shows the true temperature in Celsius at specific points on the scale. This is the perception of the instrument&#x27;s end-user. However, very few instruments can be adjusted to exactly match the standards they are compared to. For the vast majority of calibrations, the calibration process is actually the comparison of an unknown to a known and recording the results.

==Basic calibration process==

===Purpose and scope===
The calibration process begins with the design of the measuring instrument that needs to be calibrated. The design has to be able to &quot;hold a calibration&quot; through its calibration interval. In other words, the design has to be capable of measurements that are &quot;within engineering tolerance&quot; when used within the stated environmental conditions over some reasonable period of time. Having a design with these characteristics increases the likelihood of the actual measuring instruments performing as expected.
Basically, the purpose of calibration is for maintaining the quality of measurement as well as to ensure the proper working of particular instrument.

===Intervals===
The exact mechanism for assigning tolerance values varies by country and as per the industry type. The measuring of equipment is manufacturer generally assigns the measurement tolerance, suggests a calibration interval (CI) and specifies the environmental range of use and storage. The using organization generally assigns the actual calibration interval, which is dependent on this specific measuring equipment&#x27;s likely usage level. The assignment of calibration intervals can be a formal process based on the results of previous calibrations. The standards themselves are not clear on recommended CI values:
:&quot;ISO 17025&quot;
::&quot;A calibration certificate (or calibration label) shall not contain any recommendation on the calibration interval except where this has been agreed with the customer. This requirement may be superseded by legal regulations.”
:&quot;ANSI/NCSL Z540&quot;
::&quot;...shall be calibrated or verified at periodic intervals established and maintained to assure acceptable reliability...&quot;
:&quot;ISO-9001&quot;
::&quot;Where necessary to ensure valid results, measuring equipment shall...be calibrated or verified at specified intervals, or prior to use...”
:&quot;MIL-STD-45662A&quot;
::&quot;... shall be calibrated at periodic intervals established and maintained to assure acceptable accuracy and reliability...Intervals shall be shortened or may be lengthened, by the contractor, when the results of previous calibrations indicate that such action is appropriate to maintain acceptable reliability.&quot;

===Standards required and accuracy===
The next step is defining the calibration process. The selection of a standard or standards is the most visible part of the calibration process. Ideally, the standard has less than 1/4 of the measurement uncertainty of the device being calibrated. When this goal is met, the accumulated measurement uncertainty of all of the standards involved is considered to be insignificant when the final measurement is also made with the 4:1 ratio. This ratio was probably first formalized in Handbook 52 that accompanied MIL-STD-45662A, an early US Department of Defense metrology program specification. It was 10:1 from its inception in the 1950s until the 1970s, when advancing technology made 10:1 impossible for most electronic measurements.

Maintaining a 4:1 accuracy ratio with modern equipment is difficult. The test equipment being calibrated can be just as accurate as the working standard. If the accuracy ratio is less than 4:1, then the calibration tolerance can be reduced to compensate. When 1:1 is reached, only an exact match between the standard and the device being calibrated is a completely correct calibration. Another common method for dealing with this capability mismatch is to reduce the accuracy of the device being calibrated.

For example, a gauge with 3% manufacturer-stated accuracy can be changed to 4% so that a 1% accuracy standard can be used at 4:1. If the gauge is used in an application requiring 16% accuracy, having the gauge accuracy reduced to 4% will not affect the accuracy of the final measurements. This is called a limited calibration. But if the final measurement requires 10% accuracy, then the 3% gauge never can be better than 3.3:1. Then perhaps adjusting the calibration tolerance for the gauge would be a better solution. If the calibration is performed at 100 units, the 1% standard would actually be anywhere between 99 and 101 units. The acceptable values of calibrations where the test equipment is at the 4:1 ratio would be 96 to 104 units, inclusive. Changing the acceptable range to 97 to 103 units would remove the potential contribution of all of the standards and preserve a 3.3:1 ratio. Continuing, a further change to the acceptable range to 98 to 102 restores more than a 4:1 final ratio.

This is a simplified example. The mathematics of the example can be challenged. It is important that whatever thinking guided this process in an actual calibration be recorded and accessible. Informality contributes to tolerance stacks and other difficult to diagnose post calibration problems.

Also in the example above, ideally the calibration value of 100 units would be the best point in the gauge&#x27;s range to perform a single-point calibration. It may be the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendation or it may be the way similar devices are already being calibrated. Multiple point calibrations are also used. Depending on the device, a zero unit state, the absence of the phenomenon being measured, may also be a calibration point. Or zero may be resettable by the user-there are several variations possible. Again, the points to use during calibration should be recorded.

There may be specific connection techniques between the standard and the device being calibrated that may influence the calibration. For example, in electronic calibrations involving analog phenomena, the impedance of the cable connections can directly influence the result.

===Manual and automatic calibrations===
Calibration methods for modern devices can be manual or automatic.
As an example, a manual process may be used for calibration of a pressure gauge. The procedure requires multiple steps, to connect the gauge under test to a reference master gauge and an adjustable pressure source, to apply fluid pressure to both reference and test gauges at definite points over the span of the gauge, and to compare the readings of the two. The gauge under test may be adjusted to ensure its zero point and response to pressure comply as closely as possible to the intended accuracy. Each step of the process requires manual record keeping. 
An automatic pressure calibrator is a device that combines an electronic control unit, a pressure intensifier used to compress a gas such as Nitrogen, a pressure transducer used to detect desired levels in a hydraulic accumulator, and accessories such as liquid traps and gauge fittings. An automatic system may also include data collection facilities to automate the gathering of data for record keeping.

===Process description and documentation===
All of the information above is collected in a calibration procedure, which is a specific test method. These procedures capture all of the steps needed to perform a successful calibration. The manufacturer may provide one or the organization may prepare one that also captures all of the organization&#x27;s other requirements. There are clearinghouses for calibration procedures such as the Government-Industry Data Exchange Program (GIDEP) in the United States.

This exact process is repeated for each of the standards used until transfer standards, certified reference materials and/or natural physical constants, the measurement standards with the least uncertainty in the laboratory, are reached. This establishes the traceability of the calibration.

See Metrology for other factors that are considered during calibration process development.

After all of this, individual instruments of the specific type discussed above can finally be calibrated. The process generally begins with a basic damage check. Some organizations such as nuclear power plants collect &quot;as-found&quot; calibration data before any routine maintenance is performed. After routine maintenance and deficiencies detected during calibration are addressed, an &quot;as-left&quot; calibration is performed.

More commonly, a calibration technician is entrusted with the entire process and signs the calibration certificate, which documents the completion of a successful calibration.
The basic process outlined above is a difficult and expensive challenge. The cost for ordinary equipment support is generally about 10% of the original purchase price on a yearly basis, as a commonly accepted rule-of-thumb. Exotic devices such as scanning electron microscopes, gas chromatograph systems and laser interferometer devices can be even more costly to maintain.

The &#x27;single measurement&#x27; device used in the basic calibration process description above does exist. But, depending on the organization, the majority of the devices that need calibration can have several ranges and many functionalities in a single instrument. A good example is a common modern oscilloscope. There easily could be 200,000 combinations of settings to completely calibrate and limitations on how much of an all-inclusive calibration can be automated.

To prevent unauthorized access to an instrument tamper-proof seals are usually applied after calibration. The picture of the oscilloscope rack shows these, and prove that the instrument has not been removed since it was last calibrated as they will possible unauthorized to the adjusting elements of the instrument. There also are labels showing the date of the last calibration and when the calibration interval dictates when the next one is needed. Some organizations also assign unique identification to each instrument to standardize the record keeping and keep track of accessories that are integral to a specific calibration condition.

When the instruments being calibrated are integrated with computers, the integrated computer programs and any calibration corrections are also under control.

==Historical development==
===Origins===
The words &quot;calibrate&quot; and &quot;calibration&quot; entered the English language as recently as the American Civil War, in descriptions of artillery, thought to be derived from a measurement of the calibre of a gun.

Some of the earliest known systems of measurement and calibration seem to have been created between the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley, with excavations revealing the use of angular gradations for construction. The term &quot;calibration&quot; was likely first associated with the precise division of linear distance and angles using a dividing engine and the measurement of gravitational mass using a weighing scale. These two forms of measurement alone and their direct derivatives supported nearly all commerce and technology development from the earliest civilizations until about AD 1800.

===Calibration of weights and distances ()===

Early measurement devices were &quot;direct&quot;, i.e. they had the same units as the quantity being measured. Examples include length using a yardstick and mass using a weighing scale. At the beginning of the twelfth century, during the reign of Henry I (1100-1135), it was decreed that a yard be &quot;the distance from the tip of the King&#x27;s nose to the end of his outstretched thumb.&quot; However, it wasn&#x27;t until the reign of Richard I (1197) that we find documented evidence.
:&quot;Assize of Measures&quot;
:&quot;Throughout the realm there shall be the same yard of the same size and it should be of iron.&quot;

Other standardization attempts followed, such as the Magna Carta (1225) for liquid measures, until the Mètre des Archives from France and the establishment of the Metric system.

===The early calibration of pressure instruments===
One of the earliest pressure measurement devices was the Mercury barometer, credited to Torricelli (1643), which read atmospheric pressure using Mercury. Soon after, water-filled manometers were designed. All these would have linear calibrations using gravimetric principles, where the difference in levels was proportional to pressure. The normal units of measure would be the convenient inches of mercury or water.

In the direct reading hydrostatic manometer design on the right, applied pressure Pa pushes the liquid down the right side of the manometer U-tube, while a length scale next to the tube measures the difference of levels. The resulting height difference &quot;H&quot; is a direct measurement of the pressure or vacuum with respect to atmospheric pressure. In the absence of differential pressure both levels would be equal, and this would be used as the zero point. 
The Industrial Revolution saw the adoption of &quot;indirect&quot; pressure measuring devices, which were more practical than the manometer.
An example is in high pressure (up to 50 psi) steam engines, where mercury was used to reduce the scale length to about 60 inches, but such a manometer was expensive and prone to damage. This stimulated the development of indirect reading instruments, of which the Bourdon tube invented by Eugène Bourdon is a notable example. 
In the front and back views of a Bourdon gauge on the right, applied pressure at the bottom fitting reduces the curl on the flattened pipe proportionally to pressure. This moves the free end of the tube which is linked to the pointer. The instrument would be calibrated against a manometer, which would be the calibration standard. For measurement of indirect quantities of pressure per unit area, the calibration uncertainty would be dependent on the density of the manometer fluid, and the means of measuring the height difference. From this other units such as pounds per square inch could be inferred and marked on the scale.

<text>The carbon cycle is a part of the biogeochemical cycle where carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere of Earth. Other major biogeochemical cycles include the nitrogen cycle and the water cycle. Carbon is the main component of biological compounds as well as a major component of many rocks such as limestone. The carbon cycle comprises a sequence of events that are key to making Earth capable of sustaining life. It describes the movement of carbon as it is recycled and reused throughout the biosphere, as well as long-term processes of carbon sequestration (storage) to and release from carbon sinks. 

To describe the dynamics of the carbon cycle, a distinction can be made between the &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot; carbon cycle. The fast cycle is also referred to as the &quot;biological carbon cycle&quot;. Fast cycles can complete within years, moving substances from atmosphere to biosphere, then back to the atmosphere. Slow or geological cycles (also called deep carbon cycle) can take millions of years to complete, moving substances through the Earth&#x27;s crust between rocks, soil, ocean and atmosphere. 

Humans have disturbed the carbon cycle for many centuries. They have done so by modifying land use and by mining and burning carbon from ancient organic remains (coal, petroleum and gas). Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased nearly 52% over pre-industrial levels by 2020, resulting in global warming. The increased carbon dioxide has also caused a reduction in the ocean&#x27;s pH value and is fundamentally altering marine chemistry. Carbon dioxide is critical for photosynthesis.

==Main compartments of the Carbon Cycle==
The carbon cycle was first described by Antoine Lavoisier and Joseph Priestley, and popularised by Humphry Davy. The global carbon cycle is now usually divided into the following major &quot;reservoirs of carbon&quot; (also called carbon pools) interconnected by pathways of exchange:
* Atmosphere
* Terrestrial biosphere
* Ocean, including dissolved inorganic carbon and living and non-living marine biota
* Sediments, including fossil fuels, freshwater systems, and non-living organic material.
* Earth&#x27;s interior (mantle and crust). These carbon stores interact with the other components through geological processes.

The carbon exchanges between reservoirs occur as the result of various chemical, physical, geological, and biological processes. The ocean contains the largest active pool of carbon near the surface of the Earth.
The natural flows of carbon between the atmosphere, ocean, terrestrial ecosystems, and sediments are fairly balanced; so carbon levels would be roughly stable without human influence.

===Atmosphere===
Carbon in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere exists in two main forms: carbon dioxide and methane. Both of these gases absorb and retain heat in the atmosphere and are partially responsible for the greenhouse effect. Methane produces a larger greenhouse effect per volume as compared to carbon dioxide, but it exists in much lower concentrations and is more short-lived than carbon dioxide. Thus, carbon dioxide contributes more to the global greenhouse effect than methane.

Carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere primarily through photosynthesis and enters the terrestrial and oceanic biospheres. Carbon dioxide also dissolves directly from the atmosphere into bodies of water (ocean, lakes, etc.), as well as dissolving in precipitation as raindrops fall through the atmosphere. When dissolved in water, carbon dioxide reacts with water molecules and forms carbonic acid, which contributes to ocean acidity. It can then be absorbed by rocks through weathering. It also can acidify other surfaces it touches or be washed into the ocean.
Human activities over the past two centuries have increased the amount of carbon in the atmosphere by nearly 50% as of year 2020, mainly in the form of carbon dioxide, both by modifying ecosystems&#x27; ability to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and by emitting it directly, e.g., by burning fossil fuels and manufacturing concrete.

In the far future (2 to 3 billion years), the rate at which carbon dioxide is absorbed into the soil via the carbonate–silicate cycle will likely increase due to expected changes in the sun as it ages. The expected increased luminosity of the Sun will likely speed up the rate of surface weathering. This will eventually cause most of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to be squelched into the Earth&#x27;s crust as carbonate. Once the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere falls below approximately 50 parts per million (tolerances vary among species), C3 photosynthesis will no longer be possible. This has been predicted to occur 600 million years from the present, though models vary.

Once the oceans on the Earth evaporate in about 1.1 billion years from now, plate tectonics will very likely stop due to the lack of water to lubricate them. The lack of volcanoes pumping out carbon dioxide will cause the carbon cycle to end between 1 billion and 2 billion years into the future.

===Terrestrial biosphere===

The terrestrial biosphere includes the organic carbon in all land-living organisms, both alive and dead, as well as carbon stored in soils. About 500 gigatons of carbon are stored above ground in plants and other living organisms, while soil holds approximately 1,500 gigatons of carbon. Most carbon in the terrestrial biosphere is organic carbon, while about a third of soil carbon is stored in inorganic forms, such as calcium carbonate. Organic carbon is a major component of all organisms living on Earth. Autotrophs extract it from the air in the form of carbon dioxide, converting it to organic carbon, while heterotrophs receive carbon by consuming other organisms.

Because carbon uptake in the terrestrial biosphere is dependent on biotic factors, it follows a diurnal and seasonal cycle. In CO2 measurements, this feature is apparent in the Keeling curve. It is strongest in the northern hemisphere because this hemisphere has more land mass than the southern hemisphere and thus more room for ecosystems to absorb and emit carbon.

Carbon leaves the terrestrial biosphere in several ways and on different time scales. The combustion or respiration of organic carbon releases it rapidly into the atmosphere. It can also be exported into the ocean through rivers or remain sequestered in soils in the form of inert carbon. Carbon stored in soil can remain there for up to thousands of years before being washed into rivers by erosion or released into the atmosphere through soil respiration. Between 1989 and 2008 soil respiration increased by about 0.1% per year. In 2008, the global total of CO2 released by soil respiration was roughly 98 billion tonnes, about 3 times more carbon than humans are now putting into the atmosphere each year by burning fossil fuel (this does not represent a net transfer of carbon from soil to atmosphere, as the respiration is largely offset by inputs to soil carbon). There are a few plausible explanations for this trend, but the most likely explanation is that increasing temperatures have increased rates of decomposition of soil organic matter, which has increased the flow of CO2. The length of carbon sequestering in soil is dependent on local climatic conditions and thus changes in the course of climate change. 

===Ocean===
The ocean can be conceptually divided into a surface layer within which water makes frequent (daily to annual) contact with the atmosphere, and a deep layer below the typical mixed layer depth of a few hundred meters or less, within which the time between consecutive contacts may be centuries. The dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the surface layer is exchanged rapidly with the atmosphere, maintaining equilibrium. Partly because its concentration of DIC is about 15% higher but mainly due to its larger volume, the deep ocean contains far more carbon—it is the largest pool of actively cycled carbon in the world, containing 50 times more than the atmosphere—but the timescale to reach equilibrium with the atmosphere is hundreds of years: the exchange of carbon between the two layers, driven by thermohaline circulation, is slow.

Carbon enters the ocean mainly through the dissolution of atmospheric carbon dioxide, a small fraction of which is converted into carbonate. It can also enter the ocean through rivers as dissolved organic carbon. It is converted by organisms into organic carbon through photosynthesis and can either be exchanged throughout the food chain or precipitated into the oceans&#x27; deeper, more carbon-rich layers as dead soft tissue or in shells as calcium carbonate. It circulates in this layer for long periods of time before either being deposited as sediment or, eventually, returned to the surface waters through thermohaline circulation. 

Oceans are basic (with a current pH value of 8.1 to 8.2). The increase in atmospheric CO2 shifts the pH of the ocean towards neutral in a process called ocean acidification. Oceanic absorption of CO2 is one of the most important forms of carbon sequestering. The projected rate of pH reduction could slow the biological precipitation of calcium carbonates, thus decreasing the ocean&#x27;s capacity to absorb CO2.

===Geosphere===
The geologic component of the carbon cycle operates slowly in comparison to the other parts of the global carbon cycle. It is one of the most important determinants of the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, and thus of global temperatures.

Most of the Earth&#x27;s carbon is stored inertly in the Earth&#x27;s lithosphere. Much of the carbon stored in the Earth&#x27;s mantle was stored there when the Earth formed. Some of it was deposited in the form of organic carbon from the biosphere. Of the carbon stored in the geosphere, about 80% is limestone and its derivatives, which form from the sedimentation of calcium carbonate stored in the shells of marine organisms. The remaining 20% is stored as kerogens formed through the sedimentation and burial of terrestrial organisms under high heat and pressure. Organic carbon stored in the geosphere can remain there for millions of years.

Carbon can leave the geosphere in several ways. Carbon dioxide is released during the metamorphism of carbonate rocks when they are subducted into the Earth&#x27;s mantle. This carbon dioxide can be released into the atmosphere and ocean through volcanoes and hotspots. It can also be removed by humans through the direct extraction of kerogens in the form of fossil fuels. After extraction, fossil fuels are burned to release energy and emit the carbon they store into the atmosphere.

==Types of dynamic==
There is a fast and a slow carbon cycle. The fast cycle operates in the biosphere and the slow cycle operates in rocks. The fast or biological cycle can complete within years, moving carbon from atmosphere to biosphere, then back to the atmosphere. The slow or geological cycle may extend deep into the mantle and can take millions of years to complete, moving carbon through the Earth&#x27;s crust between rocks, soil, ocean and atmosphere.

The fast carbon cycle involves relatively short-term biogeochemical processes between the environment and living organisms in the biosphere (see diagram at start of article). It includes movements of carbon between the atmosphere and terrestrial and marine ecosystems, as well as soils and seafloor sediments. The fast cycle includes annual cycles involving photosynthesis and decadal cycles involving vegetative growth and decomposition. The reactions of the fast carbon cycle to human activities will determine many of the more immediate impacts of climate change.

The slow (or deep) carbon cycle involves medium to long-term geochemical processes belonging to the rock cycle (see diagram on the right). The exchange between the ocean and atmosphere can take centuries, and the weathering of rocks can take millions of years. Carbon in the ocean precipitates to the ocean floor where it can form sedimentary rock and be subducted into the Earth&#x27;s mantle. Mountain building processes result in the return of this geologic carbon to the Earth&#x27;s surface. There the rocks are weathered and carbon is returned to the atmosphere by degassing and to the ocean by rivers. Other geologic carbon returns to the ocean through the hydrothermal emission of calcium ions. In a given year between 10 and 100 million tonnes of carbon moves around this slow cycle. This includes volcanoes returning geologic carbon directly to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide. However, this is less than one percent of the carbon dioxide put into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels.

== Processes within fast carbon cycle ==

=== Terrestrial carbon in the water cycle ===
The movement of terrestrial carbon in the water cycle is shown in the diagram on the right and explained below:

# Atmospheric particles act as cloud condensation nuclei, promoting cloud formation.
#Raindrops absorb organic and inorganic carbon through particle scavenging and adsorption of organic vapors while falling toward Earth.
#Burning and volcanic eruptions produce highly condensed polycyclic aromatic molecules (i.e. black carbon) that is returned to the atmosphere along with greenhouse gases such as CO2. 
#Terrestrial plants fix atmospheric CO2 through photosynthesis, returning a fraction back to the atmosphere through respiration. Lignin and celluloses represent as much as 80% of the organic carbon in forests and 60% in pastures. 
#Litterfall and root organic carbon mix with sedimentary material to form organic soils where plant-derived and petrogenic organic carbon is both stored and transformed by microbial and fungal activity.
#Water absorbs plant and settled aerosol-derived dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) as it passes over forest canopies (i.e. throughfall) and along plant trunks/stems (i.e. stemflow). Biogeochemical transformations take place as water soaks into soil solution and groundwater reservoirs and overland flow occurs when soils are completely saturated, or rainfall occurs more rapidly than saturation into soils.
#Organic carbon derived from the terrestrial biosphere and &quot;in situ&quot; primary production is decomposed by microbial communities in rivers and streams along with physical decomposition (i.e. photo-oxidation), resulting in a flux of CO2 from rivers to the atmosphere that are the same order of magnitude as the amount of carbon sequestered annually by the terrestrial biosphere. Terrestrially-derived macromolecules such as lignin and black carbon are decomposed into smaller components and monomers, ultimately being converted to CO2, metabolic intermediates, or biomass.
#Lakes, reservoirs, and floodplains typically store large amounts of organic carbon and sediments, but also experience net heterotrophy in the water column, resulting in a net flux of CO2 to the atmosphere that is roughly one order of magnitude less than rivers. Methane production is also typically high in the anoxic sediments of floodplains, lakes, and reservoirs.
#Primary production is typically enhanced in river plumes due to the export of fluvial nutrients. Nevertheless, estuarine waters are a source of CO2 to the atmosphere, globally.
#Coastal marshes both store and export blue carbon. Marshes and wetlands are suggested to have an equivalent flux of CO2 to the atmosphere as rivers, globally.
#Continental shelves and the open ocean typically absorb CO2 from the atmosphere. 
#The marine biological pump sequesters a small but significant fraction of the absorbed CO2 as organic carbon in marine sediments (see below).

=== Terrestrial runoff to the ocean ===
Terrestrial and marine ecosystems are chiefly connected through riverine transport, which acts as the main channel through which erosive terrestrially derived substances enter into oceanic systems. Material and energy exchanges between the terrestrial biosphere and the lithosphere as well as organic carbon fixation and oxidation processes together regulate ecosystem carbon and dioxygen (O2) pools.

Riverine transport, being the main connective channel of these pools, will act to transport net primary productivity (primarily in the form of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC)) from terrestrial to oceanic systems. During transport, part of DOC will rapidly return to the atmosphere through redox reactions, causing &quot;carbon degassing&quot; to occur between land-atmosphere storage layers. The remaining DOC and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) are also exported to the ocean. In 2015, inorganic and organic carbon export fluxes from global rivers were assessed as 0.50–0.70 Pg C y−1 and 0.15–0.35 Pg C y−1 respectively. On the other hand, POC can remain buried in sediment over an extensive period, and the annual global terrestrial to oceanic POC flux has been estimated at 0.20 Gg C y−1.

=== Biological pump in the ocean ===

The ocean biological pump is the ocean&#x27;s biologically driven sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere and land runoff to the deep ocean interior and seafloor sediments. The biological pump is not so much the result of a single process, but rather the sum of a number of processes each of which can influence biological pumping. The pump transfers about 11 billion tonnes of carbon every year into the ocean&#x27;s interior. An ocean without the biological pump would result in atmospheric CO2 levels about 400 ppm higher than the present day.

Most carbon incorporated in organic and inorganic biological matter is formed at the sea surface where it can then start sinking to the ocean floor. The deep ocean gets most of its nutrients from the higher water column when they sink down in the form of marine snow. This is made up of dead or dying animals and microbes, fecal matter, sand and other inorganic material.

The biological pump is responsible for transforming dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) into organic biomass and pumping it in particulate or dissolved form into the deep ocean. Inorganic nutrients and carbon dioxide are fixed during photosynthesis by phytoplankton, which both release dissolved organic matter (DOM) and are consumed by herbivorous zooplankton. Larger zooplankton - such as copepods, egest fecal pellets - which can be reingested, and sink or collect with other organic detritus into larger, more-rapidly-sinking aggregates. DOM is partially consumed by bacteria and respired; the remaining refractory DOM is advected and mixed into the deep sea. DOM and aggregates exported into the deep water are consumed and respired, thus returning organic carbon into the enormous deep ocean reservoir of DIC.

A single phytoplankton cell has a sinking rate around one metre per day. Given that the average depth of the ocean is about four kilometres, it can take over ten years for these cells to reach the ocean floor. However, through processes such as coagulation and expulsion in predator fecal pellets, these cells form aggregates. These aggregates have sinking rates orders of magnitude greater than individual cells and complete their journey to the deep in a matter of days.

About 1% of the particles leaving the surface ocean reach the seabed and are consumed, respired, or buried in the sediments. The net effect of these processes is to remove carbon in organic form from the surface and return it to DIC at greater depths, maintaining a surface-to-deep ocean gradient of DIC. Thermohaline circulation returns deep-ocean DIC to the atmosphere on millennial timescales. The carbon buried in the sediments can be subducted into the earth&#x27;s mantle and stored for millions of years as part of the slow carbon cycle (see next section).

===Viruses as regulators===
Viruses act as &quot;regulators&quot; of the fast carbon cycle because they impact the material cycles and energy flows of food webs and the microbial loop. The average contribution of viruses to the Earth ecosystem carbon cycle is 8.6%, of which its contribution to marine ecosystems (1.4%) is less than its contribution to terrestrial (6.7%) and freshwater (17.8%) ecosystems. Over the past 2,000 years, anthropogenic activities and climate change have gradually altered the regulatory role of viruses in ecosystem carbon cycling processes. This has been particularly conspicuous over the past 200 years due to rapid industrialization and the attendant population growth.

== Processes within slow carbon cycle ==

Slow or deep carbon cycling is an important process, though it is not as well-understood as the relatively fast carbon movement through the atmosphere, terrestrial biosphere, ocean, and geosphere. The deep carbon cycle is intimately connected to the movement of carbon in the Earth&#x27;s surface and atmosphere. If the process did not exist, carbon would remain in the atmosphere, where it would accumulate to extremely high levels over long periods of time. Therefore, by allowing carbon to return to the Earth, the deep carbon cycle plays a critical role in maintaining the terrestrial conditions necessary for life to exist.

Furthermore, the process is also significant simply due to the massive quantities of carbon it transports through the planet. In fact, studying the composition of basaltic magma and measuring carbon dioxide flux out of volcanoes reveals that the amount of carbon in the mantle is actually greater than that on the Earth&#x27;s surface by a factor of one thousand. Drilling down and physically observing deep-Earth carbon processes is evidently extremely difficult, as the lower mantle and core extend from 660 to 2,891 km and 2,891 to 6,371  km deep into the Earth respectively. Accordingly, not much is conclusively known regarding the role of carbon in the deep Earth. Nonetheless, several pieces of evidence—many of which come from laboratory simulations of deep Earth conditions—have indicated mechanisms for the element&#x27;s movement down into the lower mantle, as well as the forms that carbon takes at the extreme temperatures and pressures of said layer. Furthermore, techniques like seismology have led to a greater understanding of the potential presence of carbon in the Earth&#x27;s core.

===Carbon in the lower mantle ===
Carbon principally enters the mantle in the form of carbonate-rich sediments on tectonic plates of ocean crust, which pull the carbon into the mantle upon undergoing subduction. Not much is known about carbon circulation in the mantle, especially in the deep Earth, but many studies have attempted to augment our understanding of the element&#x27;s movement and forms within the region. For instance, a 2011 study demonstrated that carbon cycling extends all the way to the lower mantle. The study analyzed rare, super-deep diamonds at a site in Juina, Brazil, determining that the bulk composition of some of the diamonds&#x27; inclusions matched the expected result of basalt melting and crystallisation under lower mantle temperatures and pressures. Thus, the investigation&#x27;s findings indicate that pieces of basaltic oceanic lithosphere act as the principle transport mechanism for carbon to Earth&#x27;s deep interior. These subducted carbonates can interact with lower mantle silicates, eventually forming super-deep diamonds like the one found.

However, carbonates descending to the lower mantle encounter other fates in addition to forming diamonds. In 2011, carbonates were subjected to an environment similar to that of 1800 km deep into the Earth, well within the lower mantle. Doing so resulted in the formations of magnesite, siderite, and numerous varieties of graphite. Other experiments—as well as petrologic observations—support this claim, indicating that magnesite is actually the most stable carbonate phase in most part of the mantle. This is largely a result of its higher melting temperature. Consequently, scientists have concluded that carbonates undergo reduction as they descend into the mantle before being stabilised at depth by low oxygen fugacity environments. Magnesium, iron, and other metallic compounds act as buffers throughout the process. The presence of reduced, elemental forms of carbon like graphite would indicate that carbon compounds are reduced as they descend into the mantle.
Polymorphism alters carbonate compounds&#x27; stability at different depths within the Earth. To illustrate, laboratory simulations and density functional theory calculations suggest that tetrahedrally coordinated carbonates are most stable at depths approaching the core–mantle boundary. A 2015 study indicates that the lower mantle&#x27;s high pressure causes carbon bonds to transition from sp2 to sp3 hybridised orbitals, resulting in carbon tetrahedrally bonding to oxygen. CO3 trigonal groups cannot form polymerisable networks, while tetrahedral CO4 can, signifying an increase in carbon&#x27;s coordination number, and therefore drastic changes in carbonate compounds&#x27; properties in the lower mantle. As an example, preliminary theoretical studies suggest that high pressure causes carbonate melt viscosity to increase; the melts&#x27; lower mobility as a result of its increased viscosity causes large deposits of carbon deep into the mantle.

Accordingly, carbon can remain in the lower mantle for long periods of time, but large concentrations of carbon frequently find their way back to the lithosphere. This process, called carbon outgassing, is the result of carbonated mantle undergoing decompression melting, as well as mantle plumes carrying carbon compounds up towards the crust. Carbon is oxidised upon its ascent towards volcanic hotspots, where it is then released as CO2. This occurs so that the carbon atom matches the oxidation state of the basalts erupting in such areas.

=== Carbon in the core ===
Although the presence of carbon in the Earth&#x27;s core is well-constrained, recent studies suggest large inventories of carbon could be stored in this region. Shear (S) waves moving through the inner core travel at about fifty percent of the velocity expected for most iron-rich alloys. Because the core&#x27;s composition is believed to be an alloy of crystalline iron and a small amount of nickel, this seismic anomaly indicates the presence of light elements, including carbon, in the core. In fact, studies using diamond anvil cells to replicate the conditions in the Earth&#x27;s core indicate that iron carbide (Fe7C3) matches the inner core&#x27;s wave speed and density. Therefore, the iron carbide model could serve as an evidence that the core holds as much as 67% of the Earth&#x27;s carbon. Furthermore, another study found that in the pressure and temperature condition of the Earth&#x27;s inner core, carbon dissolved in iron and formed a stable phase with the same Fe7C3 composition—albeit with a different structure from the one previously mentioned. In summary, although the amount of carbon potentially stored in the Earth&#x27;s core is not known, recent studies indicate that the presence of iron carbides can explain some of the geophysical observations.

==Human influence on fast carbon cycle==


Since the Industrial Revolution, and especially since the end of WWII, human activity has substantially disturbed the global carbon cycle by redistributing massive amounts of carbon from the geosphere. Humans have also continued to shift the natural component functions of the terrestrial biosphere with changes to vegetation and other land use. Man-made (synthetic) carbon compounds have been designed and mass-manufactured that will persist for decades to millennia in air, water, and sediments as pollutants. Climate change is amplifying and forcing further indirect human changes to the carbon cycle as a consequence of various positive and negative feedbacks.

=== Climate change ===


Current trends in climate change lead to higher ocean temperatures and acidity, thus modifying marine ecosystems. Also, acid rain and polluted runoff from agriculture and industry change the ocean&#x27;s chemical composition. Such changes can have dramatic effects on highly sensitive ecosystems such as coral reefs, thus limiting the ocean&#x27;s ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere on a regional scale and reducing oceanic biodiversity globally.

The exchanges of carbon between the atmosphere and other components of the Earth system, collectively known as the carbon cycle, currently constitute important negative (dampening) feedbacks on the effect of anthropogenic carbon emissions on climate change. Carbon sinks in the land and the ocean each currently take up about one-quarter of anthropogenic carbon emissions each year.

These feedbacks are expected to weaken in the future, amplifying the effect of anthropogenic carbon emissions on climate change. The degree to which they will weaken, however, is highly uncertain, with Earth system models predicting a wide range of land and ocean carbon uptakes even under identical atmospheric concentration or emission scenarios. Arctic methane emissions indirectly caused by anthropogenic global warming also affect the carbon cycle and contribute to further warming.

==== Fossil carbon extraction and burning ====
The largest and one of the fastest growing human impacts on the carbon cycle and biosphere is the extraction and burning of fossil fuels, which directly transfer carbon from the geosphere into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is also produced and released during the calcination of limestone for clinker production. Clinker is an industrial precursor of cement.

, about 450 gigatons of fossil carbon have been extracted in total; an amount approaching the carbon contained in all of Earth&#x27;s living terrestrial biomass. Recent rates of global emissions directly into the atmosphere have exceeded the uptake by vegetation and the oceans. These sinks have been expected and observed to remove about half of the added atmospheric carbon within about a century. Nevertheless, sinks like the ocean have evolving saturation properties, and a substantial fraction (20–35%, based on coupled models) of the added carbon is projected to remain in the atmosphere for centuries to millennia.

====Halocarbons====
Halocarbons are less prolific compounds developed for diverse uses throughout industry; for example as solvents and refrigerants. Nevertheless, the buildup of relatively small concentrations (parts per trillion) of chlorofluorocarbon, hydrofluorocarbon, and perfluorocarbon gases in the atmosphere is responsible for about 10% of the total direct radiative forcing from all long-lived greenhouse gases (year 2019); which includes forcing from the much larger concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane. Chlorofluorocarbons also cause stratospheric ozone depletion. International efforts are ongoing under the Montreal Protocol and Kyoto Protocol to control rapid growth in the industrial manufacturing and use of these environmentally potent gases. For some applications more benign alternatives such as hydrofluoroolefins have been developed and are being gradually introduced.

=== Land use changes ===

Since the invention of agriculture, humans have directly and gradually influenced the carbon cycle over century-long timescales by modifying the mixture of vegetation in the terrestrial biosphere. Over the past several centuries, direct and indirect human-caused land use and land cover change (LUCC) has led to the loss of biodiversity, which lowers ecosystems&#x27; resilience to environmental stresses and decreases their ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere. More directly, it often leads to the release of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems into the atmosphere.

Deforestation for agricultural purposes removes forests, which hold large amounts of carbon, and replaces them, generally with agricultural or urban areas. Both of these replacement land cover types store comparatively small amounts of carbon so that the net result of the transition is that more carbon stays in the atmosphere. However, the effects on the atmosphere and overall carbon cycle can be intentionally and/or naturally reversed with reforestation.

<doc id="47505" wikidata="Q139" url="?curid=47505" title="Queen (chess)">
<text>The queen (♕, ♛) is the most powerful piece in the game of chess. It can move any number of squares vertically, horizontally or , combining the powers of the rook and bishop. Each player starts the game with one queen, placed in the middle of the first next to the king. Because the queen is the strongest piece, a pawn is promoted to a queen in the vast majority of cases.

The predecessor to the queen is the &quot;ferz&quot;, a weak piece only able to move or capture one step diagonally, originating from the Persian game of shatranj. The modern queen gained its power and its modern move in Spain in the 15th century.
==Placement and movement==
The white queen starts on d1, while the black queen starts on d8. With the chessboard oriented correctly, the white queen starts on a white square and the black queen starts on a black square—thus the mnemonics &quot;queen gets her color&quot;, &quot;queen on [her] [own] color&quot;, or &quot;the dress [queen piece] matches the shoes [square]&quot; (Latin: &quot;servat rēgīna colōrem&quot;).

The queen can be moved any number of unoccupied squares in a straight line vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, thus combining the moves of the rook and bishop. The queen captures by moving to the square on which an enemy piece stands.



Although both players start with one queen each, a pawn can be promoted to any of several types of pieces, including a queen, when the pawn is moved to the player&#x27;s furthest rank (the opponent&#x27;s first rank). Such a queen created by promotion can be an additional queen or, if the player&#x27;s queen has been captured, a replacement queen. The queen is by far the most common piece type a pawn is promoted to due to the relative power of a queen; promotion to a queen is colloquially called &quot;queening&quot;.

==Piece value==

The queen is typically worth about nine pawns, which is slightly stronger than a rook and a bishop together, but slightly weaker than two rooks, though there are exceptions. It is almost always disadvantageous to exchange the queen for a single piece other than the enemy&#x27;s queen.

The reason that the queen is stronger than a combination of a rook and bishop, even though they control the same number of squares, is twofold. First, the queen is more mobile than the rook and the bishop, as the entire power of the queen can be transferred to another location in one move, while transferring the entire firepower of a rook and bishop requires two moves, the bishop always being restricted to squares of one color. Second, unlike the bishop, the queen is not hampered by an inability to control squares of the opposite color to the square on which it stands. A factor in favor of the rook and bishop together is that they can attack (or defend) a square twice, while a queen can only do so once. However, experience has shown that this factor is usually less significant than the points favoring the queen.

The queen is strongest when the board is open, the enemy king is poorly defended, or there are &quot;loose&quot; (i.e. undefended) pieces in the enemy camp. Because of its long range and ability to move in multiple directions, the queen is well-equipped to execute forks. Compared to other long range pieces (i.e. rooks and bishops), the queen is less restricted and stronger in closed positions.

==Strategy==
A player should generally delay developing the queen, as developing it too quickly can expose it to attacks by enemy pieces, causing the player to lose time removing the queen from danger. Despite this, beginners often the queen early in the game, hoping to plunder the enemy position and deliver an early checkmate, such as the scholar&#x27;s mate.

Early queen attacks are rare in high-level chess, but there are some openings with early queen development that are used by high-level players. For example, the Scandinavian Defense (1.e4 d5), which often features queen moves by Black on the second and third moves, is considered sound and has been played at the world championship level. Some less common examples have also been observed in high-level games. The Danvers Opening (1.e4 e5 2.Qh5), which is widely characterized as a beginner&#x27;s opening, has occasionally been played by the American grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura.

A queen exchange often marks the beginning of the endgame, but there are queen endgames, and sometimes queens are exchanged in the opening, long before the endgame. A common goal in the endgame is to promote a pawn to a queen. As the queen has the largest range and mobility, queen and king vs. lone king is an easy win when compared to some other basic mates. Queen and king vs. rook and king is also a win for the player with the queen, but it is not easy.

==Queen sacrifice==

A &quot;queen sacrifice&quot; is the deliberate sacrifice of a queen in order to gain a more favorable tactical position. One of the most widely known examples of this was in the game Anderssen–Kieseritzky, 1851, where Anderssen sacrificed a queen (along with three other pieces) to reach checkmate.

==History==

The queen was originally the counsellor or prime minister or vizier (Sanskrit &quot;mantri&quot;, Persian &quot;farzīn&quot;, Arabic &quot;firzān&quot;, &quot;firz&quot; or &quot;wazīr&quot;). Initially, its only move was one square diagonally. Around 1300, its abilities were enhanced to allow it to jump two squares diagonally (onto a same-colored square) for its first move.

The &quot;fers&quot; changed into the queen over time. The first surviving mention of this piece as a queen or similar is the Latin in the &quot;Einsiedeln Poem&quot;, a 98-line Medieval Latin poem written around 997 and preserved in a monastery at Einsiedeln in Switzerland. Some surviving early medieval pieces depict the piece as a queen. The word &quot;fers&quot; became grammatically feminized in several languages, such as &quot;alferza&quot; in Spanish and &quot;fierce&quot; or &quot;fierge&quot; in French. The &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; also refer to the queen as &quot;femina&quot; (woman) and &quot;coniunx&quot; (spouse), and the name &quot;Amazon&quot; has sometimes been seen.

During the great chess reform at the end of the 15th century, Catholic nations kept using an equivalent of Latin &quot;domina&quot; (&quot;lady&quot;), such as &quot;dama&quot; in Spanish, &quot;donna&quot; in Italy, and &quot;dame&quot; in France, all of which evoke &quot;Our Lady&quot;. However, Protestant nations such as Germany and England refused any derivatives of &quot;domina&quot; as it might have suggested some cult of the Virgin Mary and instead opted for secular terms such as &quot;Königin&quot; in German and &quot;queen&quot; in English.

In Russian, the piece keeps its Persian name of &quot;ferz&quot;; &quot;koroleva&quot; (queen) is colloquial and is never used by professional chess players. However, the names &quot;korolevna&quot; (king&#x27;s daughter), &quot;tsaritsa&quot; (tsar&#x27;s wife), and &quot;baba&quot; (old woman) are attested as early as 1694. In Arabic countries, the queen remains termed and, in some cases, depicted as a vizier.

Historian Marilyn Yalom proposes several factors that might have been partly responsible for influencing the piece towards its identity as a queen and its power in modern chess: the prominence of medieval queens such as Eleanor of Aquitaine, Blanche of Castile, and more particularly Isabella I of Castile; the cult of the Virgin Mary; the power ascribed to women in the troubadour tradition of courtly love; and the medieval popularity of chess as a game particularly suitable for women to play on equal terms with men. She points to medieval poetry depicting the Virgin as the chess-queen of God or &quot;Fierce Dieu&quot;.

Significantly, the earliest surviving treatise to describe the modern movement of the queen (as well as the bishop and pawn), &quot;Repetición de amores e arte de axedres con CL iuegos de partido&quot; (&quot;Discourses on Love and the Art of Chess with 150 Problems&quot;) by Luis Ramírez de Lucena, was published during the reign of Isabella I of Castile. Even before that, the Valencian poem &quot;Scachs d&#x27;amor&quot; (&quot;Chess of Love&quot;) depicted a chess game between Francesc de Castellví and Narcís de Vinyoles and commented on by Bernat Fenollar, which clearly had the modern moves of the queen and the bishop. Well before the queen&#x27;s powers expanded, it was already being romantically described as essential to the king&#x27;s survival, so that when the queen was lost, there was nothing more of value on the board.

Marilyn Yalom wrote that:
* The chess queen, rather than ferz or similar, is known of in what is now Spain and Portugal only from the 12th century, but started sooner elsewhere.
* The modern move of the Queen started in Spain during Isabella I&#x27;s reign, perhaps inspired by her great political power, and spread from there, perhaps being spread by the invention of printing and the 1492 Expulsion from Spain of the Jews who carried the new chess rule with them as they fled.

During the 15th century, the queen&#x27;s move took its modern form as a combination of the move of the rook and the current move of the bishop. Starting from Spain, this new version – called &quot;queen&#x27;s chess&quot; (in Italian, &quot;scacchi della donna&quot;) or, pejoratively, &quot;madwoman&#x27;s chess&quot; (&quot;scacchi alla rabiosa&quot;) – spread throughout Europe rapidly, partly due to the advent of the printing press and the popularity of new books on chess. The new rules faced a backlash in some quarters, ranging from anxiety over a powerful female warrior figure to frank abuse against women in general.

At various times, the ability of pawns to be queened was restricted while the original queen was still on the board, so as not to cause scandal by providing the king with more than one queen. An early 12th-century Latin poem refers to a queened pawn as a &quot;ferzia&quot;, as opposed to the original queen or &quot;regina&quot;, to account for this.

When the queen was attacked, it was customary to warn the opponent by announcing &quot;&quot;gardez la reine&quot; or simply &quot;gardez&quot;&quot;, similar to the announcement of &quot;check&quot;. Some published rules even required this announcement before the queen could be legally captured. This custom was largely abandoned in the 19th century.

In Russia, for a long time, the queen could also move like a knight; some players disapproved of this ability to &quot;gallop like the horse&quot; (knight). The book &quot;A History of Chess&quot; by H.J.R. Murray, says that William Coxe, who was in Russia in 1772, saw chess played with the queen also moving like a knight. Such an augmented queen piece is now known as the fairy chess piece &quot;amazon&quot;.

Around 1230, the queen was also independently invented as a piece in Japan, where it formed part of the game of dai shogi. The piece was retained in the smaller and more popular chu shogi, but does not form a part of modern shogi.

===Nomenclature===
In most languages the piece is known as &quot;queen&quot; or &quot;lady&quot; (e.g. Italian &quot;regina&quot; or Spanish &quot;dama&quot;). Asian and Eastern European languages tend to refer to it as &quot;vizier&quot;, minister or advisor (e.g. Arabic/Persian وزیر &quot;wazir&quot; (vazir), Russian/Persian ферзь/فرز &quot;ferz&quot;). In Polish it is known as the &quot;hetman&quot;, the name of a major historical military-political office, while in Estonian it is called &quot;lipp&quot; (&quot;flag&quot;, &quot;standard&quot;).

<text>Cirrus (cloud classification symbol: Ci) is a genus of high cloud made of ice crystals. Cirrus clouds typically appear delicate and wispy with white strands. In the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, cirrus are usually formed when warm, dry air rises, causing water vapor deposition onto mineral dust and metallic particles at high altitudes. Globally, they form anywhere between above sea level, with the higher elevations usually in the tropics and the lower elevations in more polar regions.

Cirrus clouds can form from the tops of thunderstorms and tropical cyclones and sometimes predict the arrival of rain or storms. Although they are a sign that rain and maybe storms are on the way, cirrus themselves drop no more than falling streaks of ice crystals. These crystals dissipate, melt, and evaporate as they fall through warmer and drier air and never reach ground. Cirrus clouds warm the earth, potentially contributing to climate change. A warming earth will likely produce more cirrus clouds, potentially resulting in a self-reinforcing loop.

Optical phenomena, such as sun dogs and halos, can be produced by light interacting with ice crystals in cirrus clouds. There are two other high-level cirrus-like clouds called cirrostratus and cirrocumulus. Cirrostratus looks like a sheet of cloud, whereas cirrocumulus looks like a pattern of small cloud tufts. Unlike cirrus and cirrostratus, cirrocumulus clouds contain droplets of supercooled (below freezing point) water.

Cirrus clouds form in the atmospheres of Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; and on Titan, one of Saturn&#x27;s larger moons. Some of these extraterrestrial cirrus clouds are made of ammonia or methane, much like water ice in cirrus on Earth. Some interstellar clouds, made of grains of dust smaller than a thousandth of a millimeter, are also called &quot;cirrus&quot;.

== Description ==
Cirrus are wispy clouds made of long strands of ice crystals that are described as feathery, hair-like, or layered in appearance. First defined scientifically by Luke Howard in an 1803 paper, their name is derived from the Latin word &quot;cirrus&quot;, meaning &#x27;curl&#x27; or &#x27;fringe&#x27;. They are transparent, meaning that the sun can be seen through them. Ice crystals in the clouds cause them to usually appear white, but the rising or setting sun can color them various shades of yellow or red. At dusk, they can appear gray.

Cirrus comes in five visually-distinct species: castellanus, fibratus, floccus, spissatus, and uncinus:

* Cirrus castellanus has cumuliform tops caused by high-altitude convection rising up from the main cloud body.
* Cirrus fibratus looks striated and is the most common cirrus species.
* Cirrus floccus species looks like a series of .
* Cirrus spissatus is a particularly dense form of cirrus that often forms from thunderstorms.
* Cirrus uncinus clouds are hooked and are the form that is usually called mare&#x27;s tails.

Each species is divided into up to four varieties: intortus, vertebratus, radiatus, and duplicatus:

* Intortus variety has an extremely contorted shape, with Kelvin–Helmholtz waves being a form of cirrus intortus that has been twisted into loops by layers of wind blowing at different speeds, called wind shear.
* Radiatus variety has large, radial bands of cirrus clouds that stretch across the sky.
* Vertebratus variety occurs when cirrus clouds are arranged side-by-side like ribs. 
* Duplicatus variety occurs when cirrus clouds are arranged above one another in layers.

Cirrus clouds often produce hair-like filaments called fall streaks, made of heavier ice crystals that fall from the cloud. These are similar to the virga produced in liquid–water clouds. The sizes and shapes of fall streaks are determined by the wind shear.

Cirrus cloud cover varies diurnally. During the day, cirrus cloud cover drops, and during the night, it increases. Based on CALIPSO satellite data, cirrus covers an average of 31% to 32% of the Earth&#x27;s surface. Cirrus cloud cover varies wildly by location, with some parts of the tropics reaching up to 70% cirrus cloud cover. Polar regions, on the other hand, have significantly less cirrus cloud cover, with some areas having a yearly average of only around 10% coverage. These percentages treat clear days and nights, as well as days and nights with other cloud types, as lack of cirrus cloud cover.

== Formation ==
Cirrus clouds are usually formed as warm, dry air rises, causing water vapor to undergo deposition onto particles, including mostly mineral dust and metallic particles at high altitudes. Particles gathered by research aircraft from cirrus clouds over several locations above North America and Central America included mineral dust (containing aluminum, potassium, calcium, iron, and silicon), metallic particles in elemental, sulfate and oxide forms (containing sodium, potassium, iron, nickel, copper, zinc, tin, silver, molybdenum and lead), possible biological particles (containing oxygen, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus) and elemental carbon. The authors concluded that mineral dust contributed the largest number of ice nuclei to cirrus cloud formation.

The average cirrus cloud altitude increases as latitude decreases, but the altitude is always capped by the tropopause. These conditions commonly occur at the leading edge of a warm front. Because absolute humidity is low at such high altitudes, this genus tends to be fairly transparent. Cirrus clouds can also form inside fallstreak holes (also called &quot;cavum&quot;).

At latitudes of 65° N or S, close to polar regions, cirrus clouds form, on average, only above sea level. In temperate regions, at roughly 45° N or S, their average altitude increases to above sea level. In tropical regions, at roughly 5° N or S, cirrus clouds form above sea level on average. Across the globe, cirrus clouds can form anywhere from above sea level. Cirrus clouds form with a vast range of thicknesses. They can be as little as from top to bottom to as thick as . Cirrus cloud thickness is usually somewhere between those two extremes, with an average thickness of .

The jet stream, a high-level wind band, can stretch cirrus clouds long enough to cross continents. Jet streaks, bands of faster-moving air in the jet stream, can create arcs of cirrus cloud hundreds of kilometers long.

Cirrus cloud formation may be effected by organic aerosols (particles produced by plants) acting as additional nucleation points for ice crystal formation. However, research suggests that cirrus clouds more commonly form on mineral dust or metallic particles rather than on organic ones.

=== Tropical cyclones ===
Sheets of cirrus clouds commonly fan out from the eye walls of tropical cyclones. (The eye wall is the ring of storm clouds surrounding the eye of a tropical cyclone.) A large shield of cirrus and cirrostratus typically accompanies the high altitude outflowing winds of tropical cyclones, and these can make the underlying bands of rain—and sometimes even the eye—difficult to detect in satellite photographs.

=== Thunderstorms ===

Thunderstorms can form dense cirrus at their tops. As the cumulonimbus cloud in a thunderstorm grows vertically, the liquid water droplets freeze when the air temperature reaches the freezing point. The anvil cloud takes its shape because the temperature inversion at the tropopause prevents the warm, moist air forming the thunderstorm from rising any higher, thus creating the flat top. In the tropics, these thunderstorms occasionally produce copious amounts of cirrus from their anvils. High-altitude winds commonly push this dense mat out into an anvil shape that stretches downwind as much as several kilometers.

Individual cirrus cloud formations can be the remnants of anvil clouds formed by thunderstorms. In the dissipating stage of a cumulonimbus cloud, when the normal column rising up to the anvil has evaporated or dissipated, the mat of cirrus in the anvil is all that is left.

=== Contrails ===
Contrails are an artificial type of cirrus cloud formed when water vapor from the exhaust of a jet engine condenses on particles, which come from either the surrounding air or the exhaust itself, and freezes, leaving behind a visible trail. The exhaust can trigger the formation of cirrus by providing ice nuclei when there is an insufficient naturally-occurring supply in the atmosphere. One of the environmental impacts of aviation is that persistent contrails can form into large mats of cirrus, and increased air traffic has been implicated as one possible cause of the increasing frequency and amount of cirrus in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.
== Use in forecasting ==
Random, isolated cirrus do not have any particular significance. A large number of cirrus clouds can be a sign of an approaching frontal system or upper air disturbance. The appearance of cirrus signals a change in weather—usually more stormy—in the near future. If the cloud is a &quot;cirrus castellanus&quot;, there might be instability at the high altitude level. When the clouds deepen and spread, especially when they are of the &quot;cirrus radiatus&quot; variety or &quot;cirrus fibratus&quot; species, this usually indicates an approaching weather front. If it is a warm front, the cirrus clouds spread out into cirrostratus, which then thicken and lower into altocumulus and altostratus. The next set of clouds are the rain-bearing nimbostratus clouds. When cirrus clouds precede a cold front, squall line or multicellular thunderstorm, it is because they are blown off the anvil, and the next clouds to arrive are the cumulonimbus clouds. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves indicate extreme wind shear at high levels. When a jet streak creates a large arc of cirrus, weather conditions may be right for the development of winter storms.

Within the tropics, 36 hours prior to the center passage of a tropical cyclone, a veil of white cirrus clouds approaches from the direction of the cyclone. In the mid- to late-19th century, forecasters used these cirrus veils to predict the arrival of hurricanes. In the early 1870s the president of Belén College in Havana, Father Benito Viñes, developed the first hurricane forecasting system; he mainly used the motion of these clouds in formulating his predictions. He would observe the clouds hourly from 4:00 am to 10:00 pm. After accumulating enough information, Viñes began accurately predicting the paths of hurricanes; he summarized his observations in his book &quot;Apuntes Relativos a los Huracanes de las Antilles&quot;, published in English as &quot;Practical Hints in Regard to West Indian Hurricanes&quot;.

== Effects on climate ==
Cirrus clouds cover up to 25% of the Earth (up to 70% in the tropics at night) and have a net heating effect. When they are thin and translucent, the clouds efficiently absorb outgoing infrared radiation while only marginally reflecting the incoming sunlight. When cirrus clouds are thick, they reflect only around 9% of the incoming sunlight, but they prevent almost 50% of the outgoing infrared radiation from escaping, thus raising the temperature of the atmosphere beneath the clouds by an average of 10 °C (18 °F)—a process known as the greenhouse effect. Averaged worldwide, cloud formation results in a temperature loss of 5 °C (9 °F) at the earth&#x27;s surface, mainly the result of stratocumulus clouds.

Cirrus clouds are likely becoming more common due to climate change. As their greenhouse effect is stronger than their reflection of sunlight, this would act as a self-reinforcing feedback. Metallic particles from human sources act as additional nucleation seeds, potentially increasing cirrus cloud cover and thus contributing further to climate change. Aircraft in the upper troposphere can create contrail cirrus clouds if local weather conditions are right. These contrails contribute to climate change.

Cirrus cloud thinning has been proposed as a possible geoengineering approach to reduce climate damage due to carbon dioxide. Cirrus cloud thinning would involve injecting particles into the upper troposphere to reduce the amount of cirrus clouds. The 2021 IPCC Assessment Report expressed low confidence in the cooling effect of cirrus cloud thinning, due to limited understanding.

== Cloud properties ==
Scientists have studied the properties of cirrus using several different methods. Lidar (laser-based radar) gives highly accurate information on the cloud&#x27;s altitude, length, and width. Balloon-carried hygrometers measure the humidity of the cirrus cloud but are not accurate enough to measure the depth of the cloud. Radar units give information on the altitudes and thicknesses of cirrus clouds. Another data source is satellite measurements from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment program. These satellites measure where infrared radiation is absorbed in the atmosphere, and if it is absorbed at cirrus altitudes, then it is assumed that there are cirrus clouds in that location. NASA&#x27;s Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer gives information on the cirrus cloud cover by measuring reflected infrared radiation of various specific frequencies during the day. During the night, it determines cirrus cover by detecting the Earth&#x27;s infrared emissions. The cloud reflects this radiation back to the ground, thus enabling satellites to see the &quot;shadow&quot; it casts into space. Visual observations from aircraft or the ground provide additional information about cirrus clouds. Particle Analysis by Laser Mass Spectrometry (PALMS) is used to identify the type of nucleation seeds that spawned the ice crystals in a cirrus cloud.

Cirrus clouds have an average ice crystal concentration of 300,000 ice crystals per 10 cubic meters (270,000 ice crystals per 10 cubic yards). The concentration ranges from as low as 1 ice crystal per 10 cubic meters to as high as 100 million ice crystals per 10 cubic meters (just under 1 ice crystal per 10 cubic yards to 77 million ice crystals per 10 cubic yards), a difference of eight orders of magnitude. The size of each ice crystal is typically 0.25 millimeters, but they range from as short as 0.01 millimeters up to several millimeters. The ice crystals in contrails can be much smaller than those in naturally-occurring cirrus cloud, being around 0.001 millimeters to 0.1 millimeters in length.

In addition to forming in different sizes, the ice crystals in cirrus clouds can crystallize in different shapes: solid columns, hollow columns, plates, rosettes, and conglomerations of the various other types. The shape of the ice crystals is determined by the air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and ice supersaturation (the amount by which the relative humidity exceeds 100%). Cirrus in temperate regions typically have the various ice crystal shapes separated by type. The columns and plates concentrate near the top of the cloud, whereas the rosettes and conglomerations concentrate near the base. In the northern Arctic region, cirrus clouds tend to be composed of only the columns, plates, and conglomerations, and these crystals tend to be at least four times larger than the minimum size. In Antarctica, cirrus are usually composed of only columns which are much longer than normal.

Cirrus clouds are usually colder than . At temperatures above , most cirrus clouds have relative humidities of roughly 100% (that is they are saturated). Cirrus can supersaturate, with relative humidities over ice that can exceed 200%. Below there are more of both undersaturated and supersaturated cirrus clouds. The more supersaturated clouds are probably young cirrus.

== Optical phenomena ==
Cirrus clouds can produce several optical effects like halos around the Sun and Moon. Halos are caused by interaction of the light with hexagonal ice crystals present in the clouds which, depending on their shape and orientation, can result in a wide variety of white and colored rings, arcs and spots in the sky, including sun dogs, the 46° halo, the 22° halo, and circumhorizontal arcs. Circumhorizontal arcs are only visible when the Sun rises higher than 58° above the horizon, preventing observers at higher latitudes from ever being able to see them.

More rarely, cirrus clouds are capable of producing glories, more commonly associated with liquid water-based clouds such as stratus. A glory is a set of concentric, faintly-colored glowing rings that appear around the shadow of the observer, and are best observed from a high viewpoint or from a plane. Cirrus clouds only form glories when the constituent ice crystals are ; researchers suggest that the ice crystals must be between 0.009 millimeters and 0.015 millimeters in length for a glory to appear.

== Relation to other clouds ==
Cirrus clouds are one of three different genera of high-level clouds, all of which are given the prefix &quot;cirro-&quot;. The other two genera are cirrocumulus and cirrostratus. High-level clouds usually form above . Cirrocumulus and cirrostratus are sometimes informally referred to as &quot;cirriform clouds&quot; because of their frequent association with cirrus.

In the intermediate range, from , are the mid-level clouds, which are given the prefix &quot;alto-&quot;. They comprise two genera, altostratus and altocumulus. These clouds are formed from ice crystals, supercooled water droplets, or liquid water droplets.

Low-level clouds usually form below and do not have a prefix. The two genera that are strictly low-level are stratus, and stratocumulus. These clouds are composed of water droplets, except during winter when they are formed of supercooled water droplets or ice crystals if the temperature at cloud level is below freezing. Three additional genera usually form in the low-altitude range, but may be based at higher levels under conditions of very low humidity. They are the genera cumulus, and cumulonimbus, and nimbostratus. These are sometimes classified separately as clouds of vertical development, especially when their tops are high enough to be composed of supercooled water droplets or ice crystals.

=== Cirrocumulus ===

Cirrocumulus clouds form in sheets or patches and do not cast shadows. They commonly appear in regular, rippling patterns or in rows of clouds with clear areas between. Cirrocumulus are, like other members of the cumuliform category, formed via convective processes. Significant growth of these patches indicates high-altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather. The ice crystals in the bottoms of cirrocumulus clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders. They are not solid, but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming in from the ends. Towards the top of the cloud, these crystals have a tendency to clump together. These clouds do not last long, and they tend to change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the ice crystals, they eventually begin to fall, destroying the upward convection. The cloud then dissipates into cirrus. Cirrocumulus clouds come in four species: &quot;stratiformis&quot;, &quot;lenticularis&quot;, &quot;castellanus&quot;, and &quot;floccus&quot;. They are iridescent when the constituent supercooled water droplets are all about the same size.

=== Cirrostratus ===

Cirrostratus clouds can appear as a milky sheen in the sky or as a striated sheet. They are sometimes similar to altostratus and are distinguishable from the latter because the Sun or Moon is always clearly visible through transparent cirrostratus, in contrast to altostratus which tends to be opaque or translucent. Cirrostratus come in two species, &quot;fibratus&quot; and &quot;nebulosus&quot;. The ice crystals in these clouds vary depending upon the height in the cloud. Towards the bottom, at temperatures of around , the crystals tend to be long, solid, hexagonal columns. Towards the top of the cloud, at temperatures of around , the predominant crystal types are thick, hexagonal plates and short, solid, hexagonal columns. These clouds commonly produce halos, and sometimes the halo is the only indication that such clouds are present. They are formed by warm, moist air being lifted slowly to a very high altitude. When a warm front approaches, cirrostratus clouds become thicker and descend forming altostratus clouds, and rain usually begins 12 to 24 hours later.

== Other planets ==
Cirrus clouds have been observed on several other planets. In 2008, the Martian Lander &quot;Phoenix&quot; took a time-lapse photograph of a group of cirrus clouds moving across the Martian sky using lidar. Near the end of its mission, the Phoenix Lander detected more thin clouds close to the north pole of Mars. Over the course of several days, they thickened, lowered, and eventually began snowing. The total precipitation was only a few thousandths of a millimeter. James Whiteway from York University concluded that &quot;precipitation is a component of the [Martian] hydrologic cycle&quot;. These clouds formed during the Martian night in two layers, one around above ground and the other at surface level. They lasted through early morning before being burned away by the Sun. The crystals in these clouds were formed at a temperature of , and they were shaped roughly like ellipsoids 0.127 millimeters long and 0.042 millimeters wide.

On Jupiter, cirrus clouds are composed of ammonia. When Jupiter&#x27;s South Equatorial Belt disappeared, one hypothesis put forward by Glenn Orten was that a large quantity of ammonia cirrus clouds had formed above it, hiding it from view. NASA&#x27;s Cassini probe detected these clouds on Saturn and thin water-ice cirrus on Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan. Cirrus clouds composed of methane ice exist on Uranus. On Neptune, thin wispy clouds which could possibly be cirrus have been detected over the Great Dark Spot. As on Uranus, these are probably methane crystals.

Interstellar cirrus clouds are composed of tiny dust grains smaller than a micrometer and are therefore not true cirrus clouds, which are composed of frozen crystals. They range from a few light years to dozens of light years across. While they are not technically cirrus clouds, the dust clouds are referred to as &quot;cirrus&quot; because of their similarity to the clouds on Earth. They emit infrared radiation, similar to the way cirrus clouds on Earth reflect heat being radiated out into space.

<text>Climate variability includes all the variations in the climate that last longer than individual weather events, whereas the term climate change only refers to those variations that persist for a longer period of time, typically decades or more. &quot;Climate change&quot; may refer to any time in Earth&#x27;s history, but the term is now commonly used to describe contemporary climate change, often popularly referred to as global warming. Since the Industrial Revolution, the climate has increasingly been affected by human activities.

The climate system receives nearly all of its energy from the sun and radiates energy to outer space. The balance of incoming and outgoing energy and the passage of the energy through the climate system is Earth&#x27;s energy budget. When the incoming energy is greater than the outgoing energy, Earth&#x27;s energy budget is positive and the climate system is warming. If more energy goes out, the energy budget is negative and Earth experiences cooling.

The energy moving through Earth&#x27;s climate system finds expression in weather, varying on geographic scales and time. Long-term averages and variability of weather in a region constitute the region&#x27;s climate. Such changes can be the result of &quot;internal variability&quot;, when natural processes inherent to the various parts of the climate system alter the distribution of energy. Examples include variability in ocean basins such as the Pacific decadal oscillation and Atlantic multidecadal oscillation. Climate variability can also result from &quot;external forcing&quot;, when events outside of the climate system&#x27;s components produce changes within the system. Examples include changes in solar output and volcanism.

Climate variability has consequences for sea level changes, plant life, and mass extinctions; it also affects human societies.
== Terminology ==
&quot;Climate variability&quot; is the term to describe variations in the mean state and other characteristics of climate (such as chances or possibility of extreme weather, etc.) &quot;on all spatial and temporal scales beyond that of individual weather events.&quot; Some of the variability does not appear to be caused by known systems and occurs at seemingly random times. Such variability is called &quot;random variability&quot; or &quot;noise&quot;. On the other hand, periodic variability occurs relatively regularly and in distinct modes of variability or climate patterns.

The term &quot;climate change&quot; is often used to refer specifically to anthropogenic climate change. Anthropogenic climate change is caused by human activity, as opposed to changes in climate that may have resulted as part of Earth&#x27;s natural processes. &quot;Global warming&quot; became the dominant popular term in 1988, but within scientific journals global warming refers to surface temperature increases while climate change includes global warming and everything else that increasing greenhouse gas levels affect.

A related term, &quot;climatic change&quot;, was proposed by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1966 to encompass all forms of climatic variability on time-scales longer than 10 years, but regardless of cause. During the 1970s, the term climate change replaced climatic change to focus on anthropogenic causes, as it became clear that human activities had a potential to drastically alter the climate. Climate change was incorporated in the title of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Climate change is now used as both a technical description of the process, as well as a noun used to describe the problem.

== Causes ==

On the broadest scale, the rate at which energy is received from the Sun and the rate at which it is lost to space determine the equilibrium temperature and climate of Earth. This energy is distributed around the globe by winds, ocean currents, and other mechanisms to affect the climates of different regions.

Factors that can shape climate are called climate forcings or &quot;forcing mechanisms&quot;. These include processes such as variations in solar radiation, variations in the Earth&#x27;s orbit, variations in the albedo or reflectivity of the continents, atmosphere, and oceans, mountain-building and continental drift and changes in greenhouse gas concentrations. External forcing can be either anthropogenic (e.g. increased emissions of greenhouse gases and dust) or natural (e.g., changes in solar output, the Earth&#x27;s orbit, volcano eruptions). There are a variety of climate change feedbacks that can either amplify or diminish the initial forcing. There are also key thresholds which when exceeded can produce rapid or irreversible change.

Some parts of the climate system, such as the oceans and ice caps, respond more slowly in reaction to climate forcings, while others respond more quickly. An example of fast change is the atmospheric cooling after a volcanic eruption, when volcanic ash reflects sunlight. Thermal expansion of ocean water after atmospheric warming is slow, and can take thousands of years. A combination is also possible, e.g., sudden loss of albedo in the Arctic Ocean as sea ice melts, followed by more gradual thermal expansion of the water.

Climate variability can also occur due to internal processes. Internal unforced processes often involve changes in the distribution of energy in the ocean and atmosphere, for instance, changes in the thermohaline circulation.

=== Internal variability ===
Climatic changes due to internal variability sometimes occur in cycles or oscillations. For other types of natural climatic change, we cannot predict when it happens; the change is called &quot;random&quot; or &quot;stochastic&quot;. From a climate perspective, the weather can be considered random. If there are little clouds in a particular year, there is an energy imbalance and extra heat can be absorbed by the oceans. Due to climate inertia, this signal can be &#x27;stored&#x27; in the ocean and be expressed as variability on longer time scales than the original weather disturbances. If the weather disturbances are completely random, occurring as white noise, the inertia of glaciers or oceans can transform this into climate changes where longer-duration oscillations are also larger oscillations, a phenomenon called red noise. Many climate changes have a random aspect and a cyclical aspect. This behavior is dubbed &quot;stochastic resonance&quot;. Half of the 2021 Nobel prize on physics was awarded for this work to Klaus Hasselmann jointly with Syukuro Manabe for related work on climate modelling. While Giorgio Parisi who with collaborators introduced the concept of stochastic resonance was awarded the other half but mainly for work on theoretical physics.

==== Ocean-atmosphere variability ====
The ocean and atmosphere can work together to spontaneously generate internal climate variability that can persist for years to decades at a time. These variations can affect global average surface temperature by redistributing heat between the deep ocean and the atmosphere and/or by altering the cloud/water vapor/sea ice distribution which can affect the total energy budget of the Earth.

==== Oscillations and cycles ====

A &quot;climate oscillation&quot; or &quot;climate cycle&quot; is any recurring cyclical oscillation within global or regional climate. They are quasiperiodic (not perfectly periodic), so a Fourier analysis of the data does not have sharp peaks in the spectrum. Many oscillations on different time-scales have been found or hypothesized:

* the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) – A large scale pattern of warmer (El Niño) and colder (La Niña) tropical sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean with worldwide effects. It is a self-sustaining oscillation, whose mechanisms are well-studied. ENSO is the most prominent known source of inter-annual variability in weather and climate around the world. The cycle occurs every two to seven years, with El Niño lasting nine months to two years within the longer term cycle. The cold tongue of the equatorial Pacific Ocean is not warming as fast as the rest of the ocean, due to increased upwelling of cold waters off the west coast of South America.
* the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) – An eastward moving pattern of increased rainfall over the tropics with a period of 30 to 60 days, observed mainly over the Indian and Pacific Oceans.
* the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) – Indices of the NAO are based on the difference of normalized sea-level pressure (SLP) between Ponta Delgada, Azores and Stykkishólmur/Reykjavík, Iceland. Positive values of the index indicate stronger-than-average westerlies over the middle latitudes.
* the Quasi-biennial oscillation – a well-understood oscillation in wind patterns in the stratosphere around the equator. Over a period of 28 months the dominant wind changes from easterly to westerly and back.
* Pacific Centennial Oscillation - a climate oscillation predicted by some climate models
* the Pacific decadal oscillation – The dominant pattern of sea surface variability in the North Pacific on a decadal scale. During a &quot;warm&quot;, or &quot;positive&quot;, phase, the west Pacific becomes cool and part of the eastern ocean warms; during a &quot;cool&quot; or &quot;negative&quot; phase, the opposite pattern occurs. It is thought not as a single phenomenon, but instead a combination of different physical processes.
* the Interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO) – Basin wide variability in the Pacific Ocean with a period between 20 and 30 years.
* the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation – A pattern of variability in the North Atlantic of about 55 to 70 years, with effects on rainfall, droughts and hurricane frequency and intensity.
* North African climate cycles – climate variation driven by the North African Monsoon, with a period of tens of thousands of years.
* the Arctic oscillation (AO) and Antarctic oscillation (AAO) – The annular modes are naturally occurring, hemispheric-wide patterns of climate variability. On timescales of weeks to months they explain 20–30% of the variability in their respective hemispheres. The Northern Annular Mode or Arctic oscillation (AO) in the Northern Hemisphere, and the Southern Annular Mode or Antarctic oscillation (AAO) in the southern hemisphere. The annular modes have a strong influence on the temperature and precipitation of mid-to-high latitude land masses, such as Europe and Australia, by altering the average paths of storms. The NAO can be considered a regional index of the AO/NAM. They are defined as the first EOF of sea level pressure or geopotential height from 20°N to 90°N (NAM) or 20°S to 90°S (SAM).
* Dansgaard–Oeschger cycles – occurring on roughly 1,500-year cycles during the Last Glacial Maximum

==== Ocean current changes ====
The oceanic aspects of climate variability can generate variability on centennial timescales due to the ocean having hundreds of times more mass than in the atmosphere, and thus very high thermal inertia. For example, alterations to ocean processes such as thermohaline circulation play a key role in redistributing heat in the world&#x27;s oceans.

Ocean currents transport a lot of energy from the warm tropical regions to the colder polar regions. Changes occurring around the last ice age (in technical terms, the last glacial period) show that the circulation in the North Atlantic can change suddenly and substantially, leading to global climate changes, even though the total amount of energy coming into the climate system did not change much. These large changes may have come from so called Heinrich events where internal instability of ice sheets caused huge ice bergs to be released into the ocean. When the ice sheet melts, the resulting water is very low in salt and cold, driving changes in circulation.

==== Life ====
Life affects climate through its role in the carbon and water cycles and through such mechanisms as albedo, evapotranspiration, cloud formation, and weathering. Examples of how life may have affected past climate include:
* glaciation 2.3 billion years ago triggered by the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis, which depleted the atmosphere of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and introduced free oxygen
* another glaciation 300 million years ago ushered in by long-term burial of decomposition-resistant detritus of vascular land-plants (creating a carbon sink and forming coal)
* termination of the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum 55 million years ago by flourishing marine phytoplankton
* reversal of global warming 49 million years ago by 800,000 years of arctic azolla blooms
* global cooling over the past 40 million years driven by the expansion of grass-grazer ecosystems

=== External climate forcing ===

==== Greenhouse gases ====
Whereas greenhouse gases released by the biosphere is often seen as a feedback or internal climate process, greenhouse gases emitted from volcanoes are typically classified as external by climatologists. Greenhouse gases, such as , methane and nitrous oxide, heat the climate system by trapping infrared light. Volcanoes are also part of the extended carbon cycle. Over very long (geological) time periods, they release carbon dioxide from the Earth&#x27;s crust and mantle, counteracting the uptake by sedimentary rocks and other geological carbon dioxide sinks.

Since the Industrial Revolution, humanity has been adding to greenhouse gases by emitting CO2 from fossil fuel combustion, changing land use through deforestation, and has further altered the climate with aerosols (particulate matter in the atmosphere), release of trace gases (e.g. nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, or methane). Other factors, including land use, ozone depletion, animal husbandry (ruminant animals such as cattle produce methane), and deforestation, also play a role.

The US Geological Survey estimates are that volcanic emissions are at a much lower level than the effects of current human activities, which generate 100–300 times the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by volcanoes. The annual amount put out by human activities may be greater than the amount released by supereruptions, the most recent of which was the Toba eruption in Indonesia 74,000 years ago.

==== Orbital variations ====

Slight variations in Earth&#x27;s motion lead to changes in the seasonal distribution of sunlight reaching the Earth&#x27;s surface and how it is distributed across the globe. There is very little change to the area-averaged annually averaged sunshine; but there can be strong changes in the geographical and seasonal distribution. The three types of kinematic change are variations in Earth&#x27;s eccentricity, changes in the tilt angle of Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation, and precession of Earth&#x27;s axis. Combined, these produce Milankovitch cycles which affect climate and are notable for their correlation to glacial and interglacial periods, their correlation with the advance and retreat of the Sahara, and for their appearance in the stratigraphic record.

During the glacial cycles, there was a high correlation between concentrations and temperatures. Early studies indicated that concentrations lagged temperatures, but it has become clear that this is not always the case. When ocean temperatures increase, the solubility of decreases so that it is released from the ocean. The exchange of between the air and the ocean can also be impacted by further aspects of climatic change. These and other self-reinforcing processes allow small changes in Earth&#x27;s motion to have a large effect on climate.

==== Solar output ====
The Sun is the predominant source of energy input to the Earth&#x27;s climate system. Other sources include geothermal energy from the Earth&#x27;s core, tidal energy from the Moon and heat from the decay of radioactive compounds. Both long term variations in solar intensity are known to affect global climate. Solar output varies on shorter time scales, including the 11-year solar cycle and longer-term modulations. Correlation between sunspots and climate and tenuous at best.

Three to four billion years ago, the Sun emitted only 75% as much power as it does today. If the atmospheric composition had been the same as today, liquid water should not have existed on the Earth&#x27;s surface. However, there is evidence for the presence of water on the early Earth, in the Hadean and Archean eons, leading to what is known as the faint young Sun paradox. Hypothesized solutions to this paradox include a vastly different atmosphere, with much higher concentrations of greenhouse gases than currently exist. Over the following approximately 4 billion years, the energy output of the Sun increased. Over the next five billion years, the Sun&#x27;s ultimate death as it becomes a red giant and then a white dwarf will have large effects on climate, with the red giant phase possibly ending any life on Earth that survives until that time.

==== Volcanism ====

The volcanic eruptions considered to be large enough to affect the Earth&#x27;s climate on a scale of more than 1 year are the ones that inject over 100,000 tons of SO2 into the stratosphere. This is due to the optical properties of SO2 and sulfate aerosols, which strongly absorb or scatter solar radiation, creating a global layer of sulfuric acid haze. On average, such eruptions occur several times per century, and cause cooling (by partially blocking the transmission of solar radiation to the Earth&#x27;s surface) for a period of several years. Although volcanoes are technically part of the lithosphere, which itself is part of the climate system, the IPCC explicitly defines volcanism as an external forcing agent.

Notable eruptions in the historical records are the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo which lowered global temperatures by about 0.5 °C (0.9 °F) for up to three years, and the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora causing the Year Without a Summer.

At a larger scale—a few times every 50 million to 100 million years—the eruption of large igneous provinces brings large quantities of igneous rock from the mantle and lithosphere to the Earth&#x27;s surface. Carbon dioxide in the rock is then released into the atmosphere.
 Small eruptions, with injections of less than 0.1 Mt of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, affect the atmosphere only subtly, as temperature changes are comparable with natural variability. However, because smaller eruptions occur at a much higher frequency, they too significantly affect Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

==== Plate tectonics ====

Over the course of millions of years, the motion of tectonic plates reconfigures global land and ocean areas and generates topography. This can affect both global and local patterns of climate and atmosphere-ocean circulation.

The position of the continents determines the geometry of the oceans and therefore influences patterns of ocean circulation. The locations of the seas are important in controlling the transfer of heat and moisture across the globe, and therefore, in determining global climate. A recent example of tectonic control on ocean circulation is the formation of the Isthmus of Panama about 5 million years ago, which shut off direct mixing between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. This strongly affected the ocean dynamics of what is now the Gulf Stream and may have led to Northern Hemisphere ice cover. During the Carboniferous period, about 300 to 360 million years ago, plate tectonics may have triggered large-scale storage of carbon and increased . Geologic evidence points to a &quot;megamonsoonal&quot; circulation pattern during the time of the supercontinent Pangaea, and climate modeling suggests that the existence of the supercontinent was conducive to the establishment of monsoons.

The size of continents is also important. Because of the stabilizing effect of the oceans on temperature, yearly temperature variations are generally lower in coastal areas than they are inland. A larger supercontinent will therefore have more area in which climate is strongly seasonal than will several smaller continents or islands.

==== Other mechanisms ====
It has been postulated that ionized particles known as cosmic rays could impact cloud cover and thereby the climate. As the sun shields the Earth from these particles, changes in solar activity were hypothesized to influence climate indirectly as well. To test the hypothesis, CERN designed the CLOUD experiment, which showed the effect of cosmic rays is too weak to influence climate noticeably.

Evidence exists that the Chicxulub asteroid impact some 66 million years ago had severely affected the Earth&#x27;s climate. Large quantities of sulfate aerosols were kicked up into the atmosphere, decreasing global temperatures by up to 26 °C and producing sub-freezing temperatures for a period of 3–16 years. The recovery time for this event took more than 30 years. The large-scale use of nuclear weapons has also been investigated for its impact on the climate. The hypothesis is that soot released by large-scale fires blocks a significant fraction of sunlight for as much as a year, leading to a sharp drop in temperatures for a few years. This possible event is described as nuclear winter.

Humans&#x27; use of land impact how much sunlight the surface reflects and the concentration of dust. Cloud formation is not only influenced by how much water is in the air and the temperature, but also by the amount of aerosols in the air such as dust. Globally, more dust is available if there are many regions with dry soils, little vegetation and strong winds.

== Evidence and measurement of climate changes ==
Paleoclimatology is the study of changes in climate through the entire history of Earth. It uses a variety of proxy methods from the Earth and life sciences to obtain data preserved within things such as rocks, sediments, ice sheets, tree rings, corals, shells, and microfossils. It then uses the records to determine the past states of the Earth&#x27;s various climate regions and its atmospheric system. Direct measurements give a more complete overview of climate variability.

=== Direct measurements ===
Climate changes that occurred after the widespread deployment of measuring devices can be observed directly. Reasonably complete global records of surface temperature are available beginning from the mid-late 19th century. Further observations are derived indirectly from historical documents. Satellite cloud and precipitation data has been available since the 1970s.

Historical climatology is the study of historical changes in climate and their effect on human history and development. The primary sources include written records such as sagas, chronicles, maps and local history literature as well as pictorial representations such as paintings, drawings and even rock art. Climate variability in the recent past may be derived from changes in settlement and agricultural patterns. Archaeological evidence, oral history and historical documents can offer insights into past changes in the climate. Changes in climate have been linked to the rise and the collapse of various civilizations.

=== Proxy measurements ===

Various archives of past climate are present in rocks, trees and fossils. From these archives, indirect measures of climate, so-called proxies, can be derived. Quantification of climatological variation of precipitation in prior centuries and epochs is less complete but approximated using proxies such as marine sediments, ice cores, cave stalagmites, and tree rings. Stress, too little precipitation or unsuitable temperatures, can alter the growth rate of trees, which allows scientists to infer climate trends by analyzing the growth rate of tree rings. This branch of science studying this called dendroclimatology. Glaciers leave behind moraines that contain a wealth of material—including organic matter, quartz, and potassium that may be dated—recording the periods in which a glacier advanced and retreated.

Analysis of ice in cores drilled from an ice sheet such as the Antarctic ice sheet, can be used to show a link between temperature and global sea level variations. The air trapped in bubbles in the ice can also reveal the CO2 variations of the atmosphere from the distant past, well before modern environmental influences. The study of these ice cores has been a significant indicator of the changes in CO2 over many millennia, and continues to provide valuable information about the differences between ancient and modern atmospheric conditions. The 18O/16O ratio in calcite and ice core samples used to deduce ocean temperature in the distant past is an example of a temperature proxy method.

The remnants of plants, and specifically pollen, are also used to study climatic change. Plant distributions vary under different climate conditions. Different groups of plants have pollen with distinctive shapes and surface textures, and since the outer surface of pollen is composed of a very resilient material, they resist decay. Changes in the type of pollen found in different layers of sediment indicate changes in plant communities. These changes are often a sign of a changing climate. As an example, pollen studies have been used to track changing vegetation patterns throughout the Quaternary glaciations and especially since the last glacial maximum. Remains of beetles are common in freshwater and land sediments. Different species of beetles tend to be found under different climatic conditions. Given the extensive lineage of beetles whose genetic makeup has not altered significantly over the millennia, knowledge of the present climatic range of the different species, and the age of the sediments in which remains are found, past climatic conditions may be inferred.

=== Analysis and uncertainties ===
One difficulty in detecting climate cycles is that the Earth&#x27;s climate has been changing in non-cyclic ways over most paleoclimatological timescales. Currently we are in a period of anthropogenic global warming. In a larger timeframe, the Earth is emerging from the latest ice age, cooling from the Holocene climatic optimum and warming from the &quot;Little Ice Age&quot;, which means that climate has been constantly changing over the last 15,000 years or so. During warm periods, temperature fluctuations are often of a lesser amplitude. The Pleistocene period, dominated by repeated glaciations, developed out of more stable conditions in the Miocene and Pliocene climate. Holocene climate has been relatively stable. All of these changes complicate the task of looking for cyclical behavior in the climate.

Positive feedback, negative feedback, and ecological inertia from the land-ocean-atmosphere system often attenuate or reverse smaller effects, whether from orbital forcings, solar variations or changes in concentrations of greenhouse gases. Certain feedbacks involving processes such as clouds are also uncertain; for contrails, natural cirrus clouds, oceanic dimethyl sulfide and a land-based equivalent, competing theories exist concerning effects on climatic temperatures, for example contrasting the Iris hypothesis and CLAW hypothesis.

== Impacts ==

=== Life ===
==== Vegetation ====
A change in the type, distribution and coverage of vegetation may occur given a change in the climate. Some changes in climate may result in increased precipitation and warmth, resulting in improved plant growth and the subsequent sequestration of airborne CO2. Though an increase in CO2 may benefit plants, some factors can diminish this increase. If there is an environmental change such as drought, increased CO2 concentrations will not benefit the plant. So even though climate change does increase CO2 emissions, plants will often not use this increase as other environmental stresses put pressure on them. However, sequestration of CO2 is expected to affect the rate of many natural cycles like plant litter decomposition rates. A gradual increase in warmth in a region will lead to earlier flowering and fruiting times, driving a change in the timing of life cycles of dependent organisms. Conversely, cold will cause plant bio-cycles to lag.

Larger, faster or more radical changes, however, may result in vegetation stress, rapid plant loss and desertification in certain circumstances. An example of this occurred during the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse (CRC), an extinction event 300 million years ago. At this time vast rainforests covered the equatorial region of Europe and America. Climate change devastated these tropical rainforests, abruptly fragmenting the habitat into isolated &#x27;islands&#x27; and causing the extinction of many plant and animal species.

==== Wildlife ====
One of the most important ways animals can deal with climatic change is migration to warmer or colder regions. On a longer timescale, evolution makes ecosystems including animals better adapted to a new climate. Rapid or large climate change can cause mass extinctions when creatures are stretched too far to be able to adapt.

==== Humanity ====
Collapses of past civilizations such as the Maya may be related to cycles of precipitation, especially drought, that in this example also correlates to the Western Hemisphere Warm Pool. Around 70 000 years ago the Toba supervolcano eruption created an especially cold period during the ice age, leading to a possible genetic bottleneck in human populations.

=== Changes in the cryosphere ===

==== Glaciers and ice sheets ====
Glaciers are considered among the most sensitive indicators of a changing climate. Their size is determined by a mass balance between snow input and melt output. As temperatures increase, glaciers retreat unless snow precipitation increases to make up for the additional melt. Glaciers grow and shrink due both to natural variability and external forcings. Variability in temperature, precipitation and hydrology can strongly determine the evolution of a glacier in a particular season.

The most significant climate processes since the middle to late Pliocene (approximately 3 million years ago) are the glacial and interglacial cycles. The present interglacial period (the Holocene) has lasted about 11,700 years. Shaped by orbital variations, responses such as the rise and fall of continental ice sheets and significant sea-level changes helped create the climate. Other changes, including Heinrich events, Dansgaard–Oeschger events and the Younger Dryas, however, illustrate how glacial variations may also influence climate without the orbital forcing.

==== Sea level change ====
During the Last Glacial Maximum, some 25,000 years ago, sea levels were roughly 130 m lower than today. The deglaciation afterwards was characterized by rapid sea level change. In the early Pliocene, global temperatures were 1–2˚C warmer than the present temperature, yet sea level was 15–25 meters higher than today.

==== Sea ice ====
Sea ice plays an important role in Earth&#x27;s climate as it affects the total amount of sunlight that is reflected away from the Earth. In the past, the Earth&#x27;s oceans have been almost entirely covered by sea ice on a number of occasions, when the Earth was in a so-called Snowball Earth state, and completely ice-free in periods of warm climate. When there is a lot of sea ice present globally, especially in the tropics and subtropics, the climate is more sensitive to forcings as the ice–albedo feedback is very strong.

== Climate history ==

Various climate forcings are typically in flux throughout geologic time, and some processes of the Earth&#x27;s temperature may be self-regulating. For example, during the Snowball Earth period, large glacial ice sheets spanned to Earth&#x27;s equator, covering nearly its entire surface, and very high albedo created extremely low temperatures, while the accumulation of snow and ice likely removed carbon dioxide through atmospheric deposition. However, the absence of plant cover to absorb atmospheric CO2 emitted by volcanoes meant that the greenhouse gas could accumulate in the atmosphere. There was also an absence of exposed silicate rocks, which use CO2 when they undergo weathering. This created a warming that later melted the ice and brought Earth&#x27;s temperature back up.

=== Paleo-eocene thermal maximum ===

The Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) was a time period with more than 5–8 °C global average temperature rise across the event. This climate event occurred at the time boundary of the Paleocene and Eocene geological epochs. During the event large amounts of methane was released, a potent greenhouse gas. The PETM represents a &quot;case study&quot; for modern climate change as in the greenhouse gases were released in a geologically relatively short amount of time. During the PETM, a mass extinction of organisms in the deep ocean took place.

=== The Cenozoic ===
Throughout the Cenozoic, multiple climate forcings led to warming and cooling of the atmosphere, which led to the early formation of the Antarctic ice sheet, subsequent melting, and its later reglaciation. The temperature changes occurred somewhat suddenly, at carbon dioxide concentrations of about 600–760 ppm and temperatures approximately 4 °C warmer than today. During the Pleistocene, cycles of glaciations and interglacials occurred on cycles of roughly 100,000 years, but may stay longer within an interglacial when orbital eccentricity approaches zero, as during the current interglacial. Previous interglacials such as the Eemian phase created temperatures higher than today, higher sea levels, and some partial melting of the West Antarctic ice sheet.

Climatological temperatures substantially affect cloud cover and precipitation. At lower temperatures, air can hold less water vapour, which can lead to decreased precipitation. During the Last Glacial Maximum of 18,000 years ago, thermal-driven evaporation from the oceans onto continental landmasses was low, causing large areas of extreme desert, including polar deserts (cold but with low rates of cloud cover and precipitation). In contrast, the world&#x27;s climate was cloudier and wetter than today near the start of the warm Atlantic Period of 8000 years ago.

==== The Holocene ====

The Holocene is characterized by a long-term cooling starting after the Holocene Optimum, when temperatures were probably only just below current temperatures (second decade of the 21st century), and a strong African Monsoon created grassland conditions in the Sahara during the Neolithic Subpluvial. Since that time, several cooling events have occurred, including:

*the Piora Oscillation
*the Middle Bronze Age Cold Epoch
*the Iron Age Cold Epoch
*the Little Ice Age
*the phase of cooling c. 1940–1970, which led to global cooling hypothesis

In contrast, several warm periods have also taken place, and they include but are not limited to:
*a warm period during the apex of the Minoan civilization
*the Roman Warm Period
*the Medieval Warm Period
*Modern warming during the 20th century

Certain effects have occurred during these cycles. For example, during the Medieval Warm Period, the American Midwest was in drought, including the Sand Hills of Nebraska which were active sand dunes. The black death plague of &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; also occurred during Medieval temperature fluctuations, and may be related to changing climates.

Solar activity may have contributed to part of the modern warming that peaked in the 1930s. However, solar cycles fail to account for warming observed since the 1980s to the present day. Events such as the opening of the Northwest Passage and recent record low ice minima of the modern Arctic shrinkage have not taken place for at least several centuries, as early explorers were all unable to make an Arctic crossing, even in summer. Shifts in biomes and habitat ranges are also unprecedented, occurring at rates that do not coincide with known climate oscillations .

=== Modern climate change and global warming ===
As a consequence of humans emitting greenhouse gases, global surface temperatures have started rising. Global warming is an aspect of modern climate change, a term that also includes the observed changes in precipitation, storm tracks and cloudiness. As a consequence, glaciers worldwide have been found to be shrinking significantly. Land ice sheets in both Antarctica and Greenland have been losing mass since 2002 and have seen an acceleration of ice mass loss since 2009. Global sea levels have been rising as a consequence of thermal expansion and ice melt. The decline in Arctic sea ice, both in extent and thickness, over the last several decades is further evidence for rapid climate change.

==== Variability between regions ====
In addition to global climate variability and global climate change over time, numerous climatic variations occur contemporaneously across different physical regions.

The oceans&#x27; absorption of about 90% of excess heat has helped to cause land surface temperatures to grow more rapidly than sea surface temperatures. The Northern Hemisphere, having a larger landmass-to-ocean ratio than the Southern Hemisphere, shows greater average temperature increases. Variations across different latitude bands also reflect this divergence in average temperature increase, with the temperature increase of northern exceeding that of the tropics, which in turn exceeds that of the southern extratropics.

Upper regions of the atmosphere have been cooling contemporaneously with a warming in the lower atmosphere, confirming the action of the greenhouse effect and ozone depletion.

Observed regional climatic variations confirm predictions concerning ongoing changes, for example, by contrasting (smoother) year-to-year global variations with (more volatile) year-to-year variations in localized regions. Conversely, comparing different regions&#x27; warming patterns to their respective historical variabilities, allows the raw magnitudes of temperature changes to be placed in the perspective of what is normal variability for each region.

Regional variability observations permit study of regionalized climate tipping points such as rainforest loss, ice sheet and sea ice melt, and permafrost thawing. Such distinctions underlie research into a possible global cascade of tipping points.

<text>Numerical climate models (or climate system models) are mathematical models that can simulate the interactions of important drivers of climate. These drivers are the atmosphere, oceans, land surface and ice. Scientists use climate models to study the dynamics of the climate system and to make projections of future climate and of climate change. Climate models can also be qualitative (i.e. not numerical) models and contain narratives, largely descriptive, of possible futures.

Climate models take account of incoming energy from the Sun as well as outgoing energy from Earth. An imbalance results in a change in temperature. The incoming energy from the Sun is in the form of short wave electromagnetic radiation, chiefly visible and short-wave (near) infrared. The outgoing energy is in the form of long wave (far) infrared electromagnetic energy. These processes are part of the greenhouse effect.

Climate models vary in complexity. For example, a simple radiant heat transfer model treats the Earth as a single point and averages outgoing energy. This can be expanded vertically (radiative-convective models) and horizontally. More complex models are the coupled atmosphere–ocean–sea ice global climate models. These types of models solve the full equations for mass transfer, energy transfer and radiant exchange. In addition, other types of models can be interlinked. For example Earth System Models include also land use as well as land use changes. This allows researchers to predict the interactions between climate and ecosystems.

Climate models are systems of differential equations based on the basic laws of physics, fluid motion, and chemistry. Scientists divide the planet into a 3-dimensional grid and apply the basic equations to those grids. Atmospheric models calculate winds, heat transfer, radiation, relative humidity, and surface hydrology within each grid and evaluate interactions with neighboring points. These are coupled with oceanic models to simulate climate variability and change that occurs on different timescales due to shifting ocean currents and the much larger heat storage capacity of the global ocean. External drivers of change may also be applied. Including an ice-sheet model better accounts for long term effects such as sea level rise.

== Uses ==

There are three major types of institution where climate models are developed, implemented and used:
* National meteorological services: Most national weather services have a climatology section.
* Universities: Relevant departments include atmospheric sciences, meteorology, climatology, and geography.
* National and international research laboratories: Examples include the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR, in Boulder, Colorado, US), the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL, in Princeton, New Jersey, US), Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research (in Exeter, UK), the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, or the Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l&#x27;Environnement (LSCE), France.
Big climate models are essential but they are not perfect. Attention still needs to be given to the real world (what is happening and why). The global models are essential to assimilate all the observations, especially from space (satellites) and produce comprehensive analyses of what is happening, and then they can be used to make predictions/projections. Simple models have a role to play that is widely abused and fails to recognize the simplifications such as not including a water cycle.

== General circulation models (GCMs) ==
== Energy balance models (EBMs) ==

Simulation of the climate system in full 3-D space and time was impractical prior to the establishment of large computational facilities starting in the 1960s. In order to begin to understand which factors may have changed Earth&#x27;s paleoclimate states, the constituent and dimensional complexities of the system needed to be reduced. A simple quantitative model that balanced incoming/outgoing energy was first developed for the atmosphere in the late 19th century. Other EBMs similarly seek an economical description of surface temperatures by applying the conservation of energy constraint to individual columns of the Earth-atmosphere system.

Essential features of EBMs include their relative conceptual simplicity and their ability to sometimes produce analytical solutions. Some models account for effects of ocean, land, or ice features on the surface budget. Others include interactions with parts of the water cycle or carbon cycle. A variety of these and other reduced system models can be useful for specialized tasks that supplement GCMs, particularly to bridge gaps between simulation and understanding.

=== Zero-dimensional models ===

Zero-dimensional models consider Earth as a point in space, analogous to the pale blue dot viewed by Voyager 1 or an astronomer&#x27;s view of very distant objects. This dimensionless view while highly limited is still useful in that the laws of physics are applicable in a bulk fashion to unknown objects, or in an appropriate lumped manner if some major properties of the object are known. For example, astronomers know that most planets in our own solar system feature some kind of solid/liquid surface surrounded by a gaseous atmosphere.

==== Model with combined surface and atmosphere ====

A very simple model of the radiative equilibrium of the Earth is

:formula_1

where
* the left hand side represents the total incoming shortwave power (in Watts) from the Sun
* the right hand side represents the total outgoing longwave power (in Watts) from Earth, calculated from the Stefan–Boltzmann law. 
The constant parameters include
* &quot;S&quot; is the solar constant – the incoming solar radiation per unit area—about 1367 W·m−2
* &quot;r&quot; is Earth&#x27;s radius—approximately 6.371×106 m
* &quot;π&quot; is the mathematical constant (3.141...)
* &quot;formula_2&quot; is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant—approximately 5.67×10−8 J·K−4·m−2·s−1

The constant formula_3 can be factored out, giving a nildimensional equation for the equilibrium

:formula_4

where
* the left hand side represents the incoming shortwave energy flux from the Sun in W·m−2
* the right hand side represents the outgoing longwave energy flux from Earth in W·m−2.
The remaining variable parameters which are specific to the planet include
* &quot;formula_5&quot; is Earth&#x27;s average albedo, measured to be 0.3.
* &quot;formula_6&quot; is Earth&#x27;s average surface temperature, measured as about 288 K as of year 2020
* &quot;formula_7&quot; is the effective emissivity of Earth&#x27;s combined surface and atmosphere (including clouds). It is a quantity between 0 and 1 that is calculated from the equilibrium to be about 0.61. For the zero-dimensional treatment it is equivalent to an average value over all viewing angles.

This very simple model is quite instructive. For example, it shows the temperature sensitivity to changes in the solar constant, Earth albedo, or effective Earth emissivity. The effective emissivity also gauges the strength of the atmospheric greenhouse effect, since it is the ratio of the thermal emissions escaping to space versus those emanating from the surface.

The calculated emissivity can be compared to available data. Terrestrial surface emissivities are all in the range of 0.96 to 0.99 (except for some small desert areas which may be as low as 0.7). Clouds, however, which cover about half of the planet&#x27;s surface, have an average emissivity of about 0.5 (which must be reduced by the fourth power of the ratio of cloud absolute temperature to average surface absolute temperature) and an average cloud temperature of about . Taking all this properly into account results in an effective earth emissivity of about 0.64 (earth average temperature ).

==== Models with separated surface and atmospheric layers ====
Dimensionless models have also been constructed with functionally separated atmospheric layers from the surface. The simplest of these is the zero-dimensional, one-layer model, which may be readily extended to an arbitrary number of atmospheric layers. The surface and atmospheric layer(s) are each characterized by a corresponding temperature and emissivity value, but no thickness. Applying radiative equilibrium (i.e conservation of energy) at the interfaces between layers produces a set of coupled equations which are solvable.

Layered models produce temperatures that better estimate those observed for Earth&#x27;s surface and atmospheric levels. They likewise further illustrate the radiative heat transfer processes which underlie the greenhouse effect. Quantification of this phenomenon using a version of the one-layer model was first published by Svante Arrhenius in year 1896.

=== Radiative-convective models ===

Water vapor is a main determinant of the emissivity of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. It both influences the flows of radiation and is influenced by convective flows of heat in a manner that is consistent with its equilibrium concentration and temperature as a function of elevation (i.e. relative humidity distribution). This has been shown by refining the zero dimension model in the vertical to a one-dimensional radiative-convective model which considers two processes of energy transport:
* upwelling and downwelling radiative transfer through atmospheric layers that both absorb and emit infrared radiation
* upward transport of heat by air and vapor convection, which is especially important in the lower troposphere.

Radiative-convective models have advantages over simpler models and also lay a foundation for more complex models. They can estimate both surface temperature and the temperature variation with elevation in a more realistic manner. They also simulate the observed decline in upper atmospheric temperature and rise in surface temperature when trace amounts of other non-condensible greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide are included.

Other parameters are sometimes included to simulate localized effects in other dimensions and to address the factors that move energy about Earth. For example, the effect of ice-albedo feedback on global climate sensitivity has been investigated using a one-dimensional radiative-convective climate model.

=== Higher-dimension models ===

The zero-dimensional model may be expanded to consider the energy transported horizontally in the atmosphere. This kind of model may well be zonally averaged. This model has the advantage of allowing a rational dependence of local albedo and emissivity on temperature – the poles can be allowed to be icy and the equator warm – but the lack of true dynamics means that horizontal transports have to be specified.

Early examples include research of Mikhail Budyko and William D. Sellers who worked on the &quot;Budyko-Sellers model&quot;. This work also showed the role of positive feedback in the climate system and has been considered foundational for the energy balance models since its publication in 1969.

== Earth systems models of intermediate complexity (EMICs) ==

Depending on the nature of questions asked and the pertinent time scales, there are, on the one extreme, conceptual, more inductive models, and, on the other extreme, general circulation models operating at the highest spatial and temporal resolution currently feasible. Models of intermediate complexity bridge the gap. One example is the Climber-3 model. Its atmosphere is a 2.5-dimensional statistical-dynamical model with 7.5° × 22.5° resolution and time step of half a day; the ocean is MOM-3 (Modular Ocean Model) with a 3.75° × 3.75° grid and 24 vertical levels.

==Box models==
Box models are simplified versions of complex systems, reducing them to boxes (or reservoirs) linked by fluxes. The boxes are assumed to be mixed homogeneously. Within a given box, the concentration of any chemical species is therefore uniform. However, the abundance of a species within a given box may vary as a function of time due to the input to (or loss from) the box or due to the production, consumption or decay of this species within the box.

Simple box models, i.e. box model with a small number of boxes whose properties (e.g. their volume) do not change with time, are often useful to derive analytical formulas describing the dynamics and steady-state abundance of a species. More complex box models are usually solved using numerical techniques.

Box models are used extensively to model environmental systems or ecosystems and in studies of ocean circulation and the carbon cycle.
They are instances of a multi-compartment model.

In 1961 Henry Stommel was the first to use a simple 2-box model to study factors that influence ocean circulation.

==History==

=== Increase of forecasts confidence over time ===
The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) has been a leading effort to foster improvements in GCMs and climate change understanding since 1995.

The IPCC stated in 2010 it has increased confidence in forecasts coming from climate models:&quot;There is considerable confidence that climate models provide credible quantitative estimates of future climate change, particularly at continental scales and above. This confidence comes from the foundation of the models in accepted physical principles and from their ability to reproduce observed features of current climate and past climate changes. Confidence in model estimates is higher for some climate variables (e.g., temperature) than for others (e.g., precipitation). Over several decades of development, models have consistently provided a robust and unambiguous picture of significant climate warming in response to increasing greenhouse gases.&quot;

== Coordination of research ==
The World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), hosted by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), coordinates research activities on climate modelling worldwide.

A 2012 U.S. National Research Council report discussed how the large and diverse U.S. climate modeling enterprise could evolve to become more unified. Efficiencies could be gained by developing a common software infrastructure shared by all U.S. climate researchers, and holding an annual climate modeling forum, the report found.

== Issues ==

=== Electricity consumption ===
Cloud-resolving climate models are nowadays run on high intensity super-computers which have a high power consumption and thus cause CO2 emissions. They require exascale computing (billion billion – i.e., a quintillion – calculations per second). For example, the Frontier exascale supercomputer consumes 29 MW. It can simulate a year’s worth of climate at cloud resolving scales in a day.

Techniques that could lead to energy savings, include for example: &quot;reducing floating point precision computation; developing machine learning algorithms to avoid unnecessary computations; and creating a new generation of scalable numerical algorithms that would enable higher throughput in terms of simulated years per wall clock day.&quot;

<text>Cloud albedo is a measure of the albedo or reflectivity of a cloud. Clouds regulate the amount of solar radiation absorbed by a planet and its solar surface irradiance. Generally, increased cloud cover correlates to a higher albedo and a lower absorption of solar energy. Cloud albedo strongly influences the Earth&#x27;s energy budget, accounting for approximately half of Earth&#x27;s albedo. Cloud albedo is influenced by the conditions of cloud formation and variations in cloud albedo depend on the total mass of water, the size and shape of the droplets or particles and their distribution in space. Thick clouds reflect a large amount of incoming solar radiation, translating to a high albedo. Thin clouds tend to transmit more solar radiation and, therefore, have a low albedo. Changes in cloud albedo caused by variations in cloud properties have a significant effect on global climate, having the ability to spiral into feedback loops.

== Cloud condensation nuclei and cloud albedo ==
On a microscopic scale, clouds are formed through the condensation of water on cloud condensation nuclei. These nuclei are aerosols such as dust or sea salt but also include certain forms of pollution. Nuclei come from a variety of natural or anthropogenic sources. For example dust can arise from windblown desserts or from human agricultural or construction activities, similarly even pollutants like VOCs or sulfates may be emitted by plant life or volcanic activity respectively. The size, concentration, structure, and chemical composition of these particles influence cloud albedo. For example, black carbon aerosol particles absorb more solar radiation and sulfate aerosols reflects more solar radiation. Smaller particles form smaller cloud droplets, which tend to decrease precipitation efficiency of a cloud and increasing cloud albedo. Additionally, more cloud condensation nuclei increases the size of a cloud and the amount of reflected solar radiation.

== Causes of cloud albedo variation ==
Cloud albedo on a planet varies from less than 10% to more than 90% and depends on liquid water/ice content, thickness of the cloud, droplet sizes, solar zenith angle, etc.

=== Water content ===

Higher liquid water and ice content in a cloud increases its albedo, which is the dominant factor in determining the cloud&#x27;s reflectivity. The change in albedo is greater for clouds with less water content to start with and larger clouds begin to receive diminishing returns with increased content. Water content taking the form of ice is common in high altitude clouds such as cirrus. 

=== Cloud thickness ===

Thicker clouds have a higher albedo than thinner ones. In fact thick clouds and thin clouds will occasionally respond differently to differences in other factors such as droplet size. Clouds that tend to be thicker and have higher albedos include cumulus, stratocumulus, and cumulonimbus clouds.

==== Liquid water path ====
Water content and cloud thickness together make a cloud&#x27;s liquid water path. This value also notably varies with changing cloud droplet size. Liquid water path is typically measured in units of g/m2 and in excess of 20 g/m2 clouds typically will become opaque to long-wavelength light although this may not hold true with cirrus clouds.

=== Droplet size ===
In general smaller droplet size is associated with increased albedo. That said, depending on the cloud location, thin clouds may actually have the opposite hold true. In the general and more influential cases however, decreased particle size makes clouds possess higher albedos by having a larger surface areas relative to their volumes. This makes the droplets whiter or more reflective.

=== The Twomey Effect (Aerosol Indirect Effect) ===

The Twomey Effect is increased cloud albedo due to cloud nuclei from pollution. Increasing aerosol concentration and aerosol density leads to higher cloud droplet concentration, smaller cloud droplets, and higher cloud albedo. In macrophysically identical clouds, a cloud with few larger drops will have a lower albedo than a cloud with more smaller drops. The smaller cloud particles similarly increase cloud albedo by reducing precipitation and prolonging the lifetime of a cloud. This subsequently increases cloud albedo as solar radiation is reflected over a longer period of time. The Albrecht Effect is the related concept of increased cloud lifetime from cloud nuclei.

=== Zenith angle ===
Cloud albedo increases with the total water content or depth of the cloud and the solar zenith angle. The variation of albedo with zenith angle is most rapid when the sun is near the horizon, and least when the sun is overhead. Absorption of solar radiation by plane-parallel clouds decreases with increasing zenith angle because radiation that is reflected to space at the higher zenith angles penetrates less deeply into the cloud and is therefore less likely to be absorbed.

== Influence on global climate ==
Cloud albedo indirectly affects global climate through solar radiation scattering and absorption in Earth&#x27;s radiation budget. Variations in cloud albedo cause atmospheric instability that influences the hydrological cycle, weather patterns, and atmospheric circulation. These effects are parameterized by cloud radiative forcing, a measure of short-wave and long-wave radiation in relation to cloud cover. The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment demonstrated that small variations in cloud coverage, structure, altitude, droplet size, and phase have significant effects on the climate. A five percent increase in short-wave reflection from clouds would counteract the greenhouse effect of the past two-hundred years.

=== Cloud albedo-climate feedback loops ===
There are a variety of positive and negative cloud albedo-climate feedback loops in cloud and climate models. An example of a negative cloud-climate feedback loop is that as a planet warms, cloudiness increases, which increases a planet&#x27;s albedo. An increase in albedo reduces absorbed solar radiation and leads to cooling. A counteracting positive feedback loop considers the rising of the high cloud layer, reduction in the vertical distribution of cloudiness, and decreased albedo.

Air pollution can result in variation in cloud condensation nuclei, creating a feedback loop that influences atmospheric temperature, relative humility, and cloud formation depending on cloud and regional characteristics. For example, increased sulfate aerosols can reduce precipitation efficiency, resulting in a positive feedback loop in which decreased precipitation efficiency increases aerosol atmospheric longevity. On the other hand, a negative feedback loop can be established in mixed-phase clouds in which black carbon aerosol can increase ice phase precipitation formation and reduce aerosol concentrations.

<text>In meteorology, a cloud is an aerosol consisting of a visible mass of miniature liquid droplets, frozen crystals, or other particles, suspended in the atmosphere of a planetary body or similar space. Water or various other chemicals may compose the droplets and crystals. On Earth, clouds are formed as a result of saturation of the air when it is cooled to its dew point, or when it gains sufficient moisture (usually in the form of water vapor) from an adjacent source to raise the dew point to the ambient temperature.

Clouds are seen in the Earth&#x27;s homosphere, which includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere.
Nephology is the science of clouds, which is undertaken in the cloud physics branch of meteorology. The World Meteorological Organization uses two methods of naming clouds in their respective layers of the homosphere, Latin and common name.

Genus types in the troposphere, the atmospheric layer closest to Earth&#x27;s surface, have Latin names because of the universal adoption of Luke Howard&#x27;s nomenclature that was formally proposed in 1802. It became the basis of a modern international system that divides clouds into five physical &quot;forms&quot; which can be further divided or classified into altitude &quot;levels&quot; to derive ten basic &quot;genera&quot;. The five main forms are stratiform sheets or veils, cumuliform heaps , stratocumuliform bands, rolls, or ripples, cumulonimbiform towers often with fibrous tops, and cirriform wisps or patches . &quot;Low-level&quot; clouds do not have any altitude-related prefixes. However &quot;mid-level&quot; stratiform and stratocumuliform types are given the prefix &quot;alto-&quot; while &quot;high-level&quot; variants of these same two forms carry the prefix &quot;cirro-&quot;. In the case of stratocumuliform clouds, the prefix &quot;strato-&quot; is applied to the low-level genus type but is dropped from the mid- and high-level variants to avoid double-prefixing with alto- and cirro-. Genus types with sufficient vertical extent to occupy more than one level do not carry any altitude-related prefixes. They are classified formally as low- or mid-level depending on the altitude at which each initially forms, and are also more informally characterized as &quot;multi-level&quot; or &quot;vertical&quot;. Most of the ten genera derived by this method of classification can be subdivided into &quot;species&quot; and further subdivided into &quot;varieties&quot;. Very low stratiform clouds that extend down to the Earth&#x27;s surface are given the common names &quot;fog&quot; and &quot;mist&quot; but have no Latin names.

In the stratosphere and mesosphere, clouds also have common names for their main types. They may have the appearance of veils or sheets, wisps, or bands or ripples, but not heaps or towers as in the troposphere. They are seen infrequently, mostly in the polar regions of Earth. Clouds have been observed in the atmospheres of other planets and moons in the Solar System and beyond. However, due to their different temperature characteristics, they are often composed of other substances such as methane, ammonia, and sulfuric acid, as well as water.

Tropospheric clouds can have a direct effect on climate change on Earth. They may reflect incoming rays from the Sun which can contribute to a cooling effect where and when these clouds occur, or trap longer wave radiation that reflects up from the Earth&#x27;s surface which can cause a warming effect. The altitude, form, and thickness of the clouds are the main factors that affect the local heating or cooling of the Earth and the atmosphere. Clouds that form above the troposphere are too scarce and too thin to have any influence on climate change. Clouds are the main uncertainty in climate sensitivity.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the term &quot;cloud&quot; can be found in the Old English words or &#x27;, meaning a hill or a mass of stone. Around the beginning of the 13th century, the word came to be used as a metaphor for rain clouds, because of the similarity in appearance between a mass of rock and cumulus heap cloud. Over time, the metaphoric usage of the word supplanted the Old English &#x27;, which had been the literal term for clouds in general.

== Homospheric nomenclatures and cross-classification ==
The table that follows is very broad in scope like the cloud genera template upon which it is partly based. There are some variations in styles of nomenclature between the classification scheme used for the troposphere (strict Latin except for surface-based aerosols) and the method used for the higher levels of the homosphere (common terms, some informally derived from Latin). However, these two schemes, both of which are authorized and used by the World Meteorological Organization, share a cross-classification of physical forms and altitude levels to derive the 10 tropospheric genera, the fog and mist that forms at surface level, and several additional major types above the troposphere. The cumulus genus includes four species that indicate vertical size which can affect the altitude levels.

== History of cloud science ==
Ancient cloud studies were not made in isolation, but were observed in combination with other weather elements and even other natural sciences. Around 340 BC, Greek philosopher Aristotle wrote &quot;Meteorologica&quot;, a work which represented the sum of knowledge of the time about natural science, including weather and climate. For the first time, precipitation and the clouds from which precipitation fell were called meteors, which originate from the Greek word &quot;meteoros&quot;, meaning &#x27;high in the sky&#x27;. From that word came the modern term meteorology, the study of clouds and weather. &quot;Meteorologica&quot; was based on intuition and simple observation, but not on what is now considered the scientific method. Nevertheless, it was the first known work that attempted to treat a broad range of meteorological topics in a systematic way, especially the hydrological cycle.
After centuries of speculative theories about the formation and behavior of clouds, the first truly scientific studies were undertaken by Luke Howard in England and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in France. Howard was a methodical observer with a strong grounding in the Latin language, and used his background to formally classify the various tropospheric cloud types during 1802. He believed that scientific observations of the changing cloud forms in the sky could unlock the key to weather forecasting.

Lamarck had worked independently on cloud classification the same year and had come up with a different naming scheme that failed to make an impression even in his home country of France because it used unusually descriptive and informal French names and phrases for cloud types. His system of nomenclature included 12 categories of clouds, with such names as (translated from French) hazy clouds, dappled clouds, and broom-like clouds. By contrast, Howard used universally accepted Latin, which caught on quickly after it was published in 1803. As a sign of the popularity of the naming scheme, German dramatist and poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe composed four poems about clouds, dedicating them to Howard.

An elaboration of Howard&#x27;s system was eventually formally adopted by the International Meteorological Conference in 1891. This system covered only the tropospheric cloud types. However, the discovery of clouds above the troposphere during the late 19th century eventually led to the creation of separate classification schemes that reverted to the use of descriptive common names and phrases that somewhat recalled Lamarck&#x27;s methods of classification. These very high clouds, although classified by these different methods, are nevertheless broadly similar to some cloud forms identified in the troposphere with Latin names.

== Formation ==

Terrestrial clouds can be found throughout most of the homosphere, which includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere. Within these layers of the atmosphere, air can become saturated as a result of being cooled to its dew point or by having moisture added from an adjacent source. In the latter case, saturation occurs when the dew point is raised to the ambient air temperature.

===Adiabatic cooling===
Adiabatic cooling occurs when one or more of three possible lifting agents – convective, cyclonic/frontal, or orographic – cause a parcel of air containing invisible water vapor to rise and cool to its dew point, the temperature at which the air becomes saturated. The main mechanism behind this process is adiabatic cooling. As the air is cooled to its dew point and becomes saturated, water vapor normally condenses to form cloud drops. This condensation normally occurs on cloud condensation nuclei such as salt or dust particles that are small enough to be held aloft by normal circulation of the air.
One agent is the convective upward motion of air caused by daytime solar heating at surface level. Low level airmass instability allows for the formation of cumuliform clouds in the troposphere that can produce showers if the air is sufficiently moist. On moderately rare occasions, convective lift can be powerful enough to penetrate the tropopause and push the cloud top into the stratosphere.

Frontal and cyclonic lift occur in the troposphere when stable air is forced aloft at weather fronts and around centers of low pressure by a process called convergence. Warm fronts associated with extratropical cyclones tend to generate mostly cirriform and stratiform clouds over a wide area unless the approaching warm airmass is unstable, in which case cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus clouds are usually embedded in the main precipitating cloud layer. Cold fronts are usually faster moving and generate a narrower line of clouds, which are mostly stratocumuliform, cumuliform, or cumulonimbiform depending on the stability of the warm airmass just ahead of the front.
A third source of lift is wind circulation forcing air over a physical barrier such as a mountain (orographic lift). If the air is generally stable, nothing more than lenticular cap clouds form. However, if the air becomes sufficiently moist and unstable, orographic showers or thunderstorms may appear.

Clouds formed by any of these lifting agents are initially seen in the troposphere where these agents are most active. However, water vapor that has been lifted to the top of troposphere can be carried even higher by gravity waves where further condensation can result in the formation of clouds in the stratosphere and mesosphere.

===Non-adiabatic cooling===
Along with adiabatic cooling that requires a lifting agent, three major nonadiabatic mechanisms exist for lowering the temperature of the air to its dew point. Conductive, radiational, and evaporative cooling require no lifting mechanism and can cause condensation at surface level resulting in the formation of fog.

===Adding moisture to the air===
Several main sources of water vapor can be added to the air as a way of achieving saturation without any cooling process: evaporation from surface water or moist ground, precipitation or virga, and transpiration from plants.

== Tropospheric classification ==

Classification in the troposphere is based on a hierarchy of categories with physical forms and altitude levels at the top. These are cross-classified into a total of ten genus types, most of which can be divided into species and further subdivided into varieties which are at the bottom of the hierarchy.
Clouds in the troposphere assume five physical forms based on structure and process of formation. These forms are commonly used for the purpose of satellite analysis. They are given below in approximate ascending order of instability or convective activity.

* Nonconvective stratiform clouds appear in stable airmass conditions and, in general, have flat, sheet-like structures that can form at any altitude in the troposphere. The stratiform group is divided by altitude range into the genera cirrostratus (high-level), altostratus (mid-level), stratus (low-level), and nimbostratus (multi-level). Fog is commonly considered a surface-based cloud layer. The fog may form at surface level in clear air or it may be the result of a very low stratus cloud subsiding to ground or sea level. Conversely, low stratiform clouds result when advection fog is lifted above surface level during breezy conditions.
* Cirriform clouds in the troposphere are of the genus cirrus and have the appearance of detached or semi-merged filaments. They form at high tropospheric altitudes in air that is mostly stable with little or no convective activity, although denser patches may occasionally show buildups caused by limited high-level convection where the air is partly unstable. Clouds resembling cirrus, cirrostratus, and cirrocumulus can be found above the troposphere but are classified separately using common names.
* Stratocumuliform clouds both cumuliform and stratiform characteristics in the form of rolls, ripples, or elements. They generally form as a result of limited convection in an otherwise mostly stable airmass topped by an inversion layer. If the inversion layer is absent or higher in the troposphere, increased airmass instability may cause the cloud layers to develop tops in the form of turrets consisting of embedded cumuliform buildups. The stratocumuliform group is divided into cirrocumulus (high-level, strato- prefix dropped), altocumulus (mid-level, strato- prefix dropped), and stratocumulus (low-level).
* Cumuliform clouds generally appear in isolated heaps or tufts. They are the product of localized but generally free-convective lift where no inversion layers are in the troposphere to limit vertical growth. In general, small cumuliform clouds tend to indicate comparatively weak instability. Larger cumuliform types are a sign of greater atmospheric instability and convective activity. Depending on their vertical size, clouds of the cumulus genus type may be low-level or multi-level with moderate to towering vertical extent.
* Cumulonimbus clouds are largest free-convective clouds, which has a towering vertical extent. They occur in highly unstable air and often have fuzzy outlines at the upper parts of the clouds that sometimes include anvil tops. These clouds are the product of very strong convection that can penetrate the lower stratosphere.

===Levels and genera===
Tropospheric clouds form in any of three levels (formerly called ) based on altitude range above the Earth&#x27;s surface. The grouping of clouds into levels is commonly done for the purposes of cloud atlases, surface weather observations, and weather maps. The base-height range for each level varies depending on the latitudinal geographical zone. Each altitude level comprises two or three genus-types differentiated mainly by physical form.

The standard levels and genus-types are summarised below in approximate descending order of the altitude at which each is normally based. Multi-level clouds with significant vertical extent are separately listed and summarized in approximate ascending order of instability or convective activity.

====High-level====
High clouds form at altitudes of in the polar regions, in the temperate regions, and in the tropics. All cirriform clouds are classified as high, thus constitute a single genus &quot;cirrus&quot; (Ci). Stratocumuliform and stratiform clouds in the high altitude range carry the prefix &quot;cirro-&quot;, yielding the respective genus names &quot;cirrocumulus&quot; (Cc) and &quot;cirrostratus&quot; (Cs). If limited-resolution satellite images of high clouds are analyzed without supporting data from direct human observations, distinguishing between individual forms or genus types becomes impossible, and they are collectively identified as &quot;high-type&quot; (or informally as &quot;cirrus-type&quot;, though not all high clouds are of the cirrus form or genus).

* Genus cirrus (Ci) – these are mostly fibrous wisps of delicate, white, cirriform, ice crystal clouds that show up clearly against the blue sky. Cirrus are generally non-convective except castellanus and floccus subtypes which show limited convection. They often form along a high altitude jetstream and at the very leading edge of a frontal or low-pressure disturbance where they may merge into cirrostratus. This high-level cloud genus does not produce precipitation.
* Genus cirrocumulus (Cc) – this is a pure white high stratocumuliform layer of limited convection. It is composed of ice crystals or supercooled water droplets appearing as small unshaded round masses or flakes in groups or lines with ripples like sand on a beach. Cirrocumulus occasionally forms alongside cirrus and may be accompanied or replaced by cirrostratus clouds near the leading edge of an active weather system. This genus-type occasionally produces virga, precipitation that evaporates below the base of the cloud.
* Genus cirrostratus (Cs) – cirrostratus is a thin nonconvective stratiform ice crystal veil that typically gives rise to halos caused by refraction of the Sun&#x27;s rays. The Sun and Moon are visible in clear outline. Cirrostratus does not produce precipitation, but often thickens into altostratus ahead of a warm front or low-pressure area, which sometimes does.

====Mid-level====
Nonvertical clouds in the middle level are prefixed by &quot;alto-&quot;, yielding the genus names &quot;altocumulus&quot; (Ac) for stratocumuliform types and &quot;altostratus&quot; (As) for stratiform types. These clouds can form as low as above surface at any latitude, but may be based as high as near the poles, at midlatitudes, and in the tropics. As with high clouds, the main genus types are easily identified by the human eye, but distinguishing between them using satellite photography alone is not possible. When the supporting data of human observations are not available, these clouds are usually collectively identified as &quot;middle-type&quot; on satellite images.

* Genus altocumulus (Ac) – This is a midlevel cloud layer of limited convection that is usually appears in the form of irregular patches or more extensive sheets arranged in groups, lines, or waves. Altocumulus may occasionally resemble cirrocumulus, but is usually thicker and composed of a mix of water droplets and ice crystals, so the bases show at least some light-gray shading. Altocumulus can produce virga, very light precipitation that evaporates before reaching the ground.
* Genus altostratus (As) – Altostratus is a midlevel opaque or translucent nonconvective veil of gray/blue-gray cloud that often forms along warm fronts and around low-pressure areas. Altostratus is usually composed of water droplets, but may be mixed with ice crystals at higher altitudes. Widespread opaque altostratus can produce light continuous or intermittent precipitation.

====Low-level====
Low clouds are found from near the surface up to . Genus types in this level either have no prefix or carry one that refers to a characteristic other than altitude. Clouds that form in the low level of the troposphere are generally of larger structure than those that form in the middle and high levels, so they can usually be identified by their forms and genus types using satellite photography alone.
* Genus stratocumulus (Sc) – This genus type is a stratocumuliform cloud layer of limited convection, usually in the form of irregular patches or more extensive sheets similar to altocumulus but having larger elements with deeper-gray shading. Stratocumulus is often present during wet weather originating from other rain clouds, but can only produce very light precipitation on its own.
* Species cumulus humilis – These are small detached fair-weather cumuliform clouds that have nearly horizontal bases and flattened tops, and do not produce rain showers.
* Genus stratus (St) – This is a flat or sometimes ragged nonconvective stratiform type that sometimes resembles elevated fog. Only very weak precipitation can fall from this cloud, usually drizzle or snow grains. When a very low stratus cloud subsides to surface level, it loses its Latin terminology and is given the common name fog if the prevailing surface visibility is less than . If the visibility is 1 km or higher, the visible condensation is termed mist.

====Multi-level or moderate vertical====

These clouds have low- to mid-level bases that form anywhere from near the surface to about and tops that can extend into the mid-altitude range and sometimes higher in the case of nimbostratus.
* Genus nimbostratus (Ns) – This is a diffuse, dark gray, multi-level stratiform layer with great horizontal extent and usually moderate to deep vertical development that looks feebly illuminated from the inside. Nimbostratus normally forms from mid-level altostratus, and develops at least moderate vertical extent when the base subsides into the low level during precipitation that can reach moderate to heavy intensity. It achieves even greater vertical development when it simultaneously grows upward into the high level due to large-scale frontal or cyclonic lift. The &quot;nimbo-&quot; prefix refers to its ability to produce continuous rain or snow over a wide area, especially ahead of a warm front. This thick cloud layer lacks any towering structure of its own, but may be accompanied by embedded towering cumuliform or cumulonimbiform types. Meteorologists affiliated with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) officially classify nimbostratus as mid-level for synoptic purposes while informally characterizing it as multi-level. Independent meteorologists and educators appear split between those who largely follow the WMO model and those who classify nimbostratus as low-level, despite its considerable vertical extent and its usual initial formation in the middle altitude range.
* Species cumulus mediocris – These cumuliform clouds of free convection have clear-cut, medium-gray, flat bases and white, domed tops in the form of small sproutings and generally do not produce precipitation. They usually form in the low level of the troposphere except during conditions of very low relative humidity, when the clouds bases can rise into the middle-altitude range. Cumulus mediocris is officially classified as low-level and more informally characterized as having moderate vertical extent that can involve more than one altitude level.

====Towering vertical====
These very large cumuliform and cumulonimbiform types have cloud bases in the same low- to mid-level range as the multi-level and moderate vertical types, but the tops nearly always extend into the high levels. Unlike less vertically developed clouds, they are required to be identified by their standard names or abbreviations in all aviation observations (METARS) and forecasts (TAFS) to warn pilots of possible severe weather and turbulence.

* Species cumulus congestus – Increasing airmass instability can cause free-convective cumulus to grow very tall to the extent that the vertical height from base to top is greater than the base-width of the cloud. The cloud base takes on a darker gray coloration and the top commonly resembles a cauliflower. This cloud type can produce moderate to heavy showers and is designated &quot;Towering cumulus&quot; (Tcu) by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).
* Genus cumulonimbus (Cb) – This genus type is a heavy, towering, cumulonimbiform mass of free-convective cloud with a dark-gray to nearly black base and a very high top in the form of a mountain or huge tower. Cumulonimbus can produce thunderstorms, local very heavy downpours of rain that may cause flash floods, and a variety of types of lightning including cloud-to-ground that can cause wildfires. Other convective severe weather may or may not be associated with thunderstorms and include heavy snow showers, hail, strong wind shear, downbursts, and tornadoes. Of all these possible cumulonimbus-related events, lightning is the only one of these that requires a thunderstorm to be taking place since it is the lightning that creates the thunder. Cumulonimbus clouds can form in unstable airmass conditions, but tend to be more concentrated and intense when they are associated with unstable cold fronts.

===Species===

Genus types are commonly divided into subtypes called &quot;species&quot; that indicate specific structural details which can vary according to the stability and windshear characteristics of the atmosphere at any given time and location. Despite this hierarchy, a particular species may be a subtype of more than one genus, especially if the genera are of the same physical form and are differentiated from each other mainly by altitude or level. There are a few species, each of which can be associated with genera of more than one physical form. The species types are grouped below according to the physical forms and genera with which each is normally associated. The forms, genera, and species are listed from left to right in approximate ascending order of instability or convective activity.

====Stable or mostly stable====
Of the non-convective stratiform group, high-level cirrostratus comprises two species. Cirrostratus &quot;nebulosus&quot; has a rather diffuse appearance lacking in structural detail. Cirrostratus &quot;fibratus&quot; is a species made of semi-merged filaments that are transitional to or from cirrus. Mid-level altostratus and multi-level nimbostratus always have a flat or diffuse appearance and are therefore not subdivided into species. Low stratus is of the species nebulosus except when broken up into ragged sheets of stratus fractus (see below).

Cirriform clouds have three non-convective species that can form in &quot;stable&quot; airmass conditions. Cirrus fibratus comprise filaments that may be straight, wavy, or occasionally twisted by wind shear. The species &quot;uncinus&quot; is similar but has upturned hooks at the ends. Cirrus &quot;spissatus&quot; appear as opaque patches that can show light gray shading.

Stratocumuliform genus-types (cirrocumulus, altocumulus, and stratocumulus) that appear in mostly stable air with limited convection have two species each. The &quot;stratiformis&quot; species normally occur in extensive sheets or in smaller patches where there is only minimal convective activity. Clouds of the &quot;lenticularis&quot; species tend to have lens-like shapes tapered at the ends. They are most commonly seen as orographic mountain-wave clouds, but can occur anywhere in the troposphere where there is strong wind shear combined with sufficient airmass stability to maintain a generally flat cloud structure. These two species can be found in the high, middle, or low levels of the troposphere depending on the stratocumuliform genus or genera present at any given time.

====Ragged====
The species &quot;fractus&quot; shows &quot;variable&quot; instability because it can be a subdivision of genus-types of different physical forms that have different stability characteristics. This subtype can be in the form of ragged but mostly &quot;stable&quot; stratiform sheets (stratus fractus) or small ragged cumuliform heaps with somewhat greater instability (cumulus fractus). When clouds of this species are associated with precipitating cloud systems of considerable vertical and sometimes horizontal extent, they are also classified as &quot;accessory clouds&quot; under the name &quot;pannus&quot; (see section on supplementary features).

====Partly unstable====

These species are subdivisions of genus types that can occur in partly unstable air with limited convection. The species &quot;castellanus&quot; appears when a mostly stable stratocumuliform or cirriform layer becomes disturbed by localized areas of airmass instability, usually in the morning or afternoon. This results in the formation of embedded cumuliform buildups arising from a common stratiform base. Castellanus resembles the turrets of a castle when viewed from the side, and can be found with stratocumuliform genera at any tropospheric altitude level and with limited-convective patches of high-level cirrus. Tufted clouds of the more detached &quot;floccus&quot; species are subdivisions of genus-types which may be cirriform or stratocumuliform in overall structure. They are sometimes seen with cirrus, cirrocumulus, altocumulus, and stratocumulus.

A newly recognized species of stratocumulus or altocumulus has been given the name &quot;volutus&quot;, a roll cloud that can occur ahead of a cumulonimbus formation. There are some volutus clouds that form as a consequence of interactions with specific geographical features rather than with a parent cloud. Perhaps the strangest geographically specific cloud of this type is the Morning Glory, a rolling cylindrical cloud that appears unpredictably over the Gulf of Carpentaria in Northern Australia. Associated with a powerful &quot;ripple&quot; in the atmosphere, the cloud may be &quot;surfed&quot; in glider aircraft.

====Unstable or mostly unstable====
More general airmass instability in the troposphere tends to produce clouds of the more freely convective cumulus genus type, whose species are mainly indicators of degrees of atmospheric instability and resultant vertical development of the clouds. A cumulus cloud initially forms in the low level of the troposphere as a cloudlet of the species &quot;humilis&quot; that shows only slight vertical development. If the air becomes more unstable, the cloud tends to grow vertically into the species &quot;mediocris&quot;, then strongly convective &quot;congestus&quot;, the tallest cumulus species which is the same type that the International Civil Aviation Organization refers to as &#x27;towering cumulus&#x27;.
With highly unstable atmospheric conditions, large cumulus may continue to grow into even more strongly convective cumulonimbus &quot;calvus&quot; (essentially a very tall congestus cloud that produces thunder), then ultimately into the species &quot;capillatus&quot; when supercooled water droplets at the top of the cloud turn into ice crystals giving it a cirriform appearance.

===Varieties===
Genus and species types are further subdivided into &quot;varieties&quot; whose names can appear after the species name to provide a fuller description of a cloud. Some cloud varieties are not restricted to a specific altitude level or form, and can therefore be common to more than one genus or species.

====Opacity-based====

All cloud varieties fall into one of two main groups. One group identifies the opacities of particular low and mid-level cloud structures and comprises the varieties &quot;translucidus&quot; (thin translucent), &quot;perlucidus&quot; (thick opaque with translucent or very small clear breaks), and &quot;opacus&quot; (thick opaque). These varieties are always identifiable for cloud genera and species with variable opacity. All three are associated with the stratiformis species of altocumulus and stratocumulus. However, only two varieties are seen with altostratus and stratus nebulosus whose uniform structures prevent the formation of a perlucidus variety. Opacity-based varieties are not applied to high clouds because they are always translucent, or in the case of cirrus spissatus, always opaque.

====Pattern-based====
A second group describes the occasional arrangements of cloud structures into particular patterns that are discernible by a surface-based observer (cloud fields usually being visible only from a significant altitude above the formations). These varieties are not always present with the genera and species with which they are otherwise associated, but only appear when atmospheric conditions favor their formation. &quot;Intortus&quot; and &quot;vertebratus&quot; varieties occur on occasion with cirrus fibratus. They are respectively filaments twisted into irregular shapes, and those that are arranged in fishbone patterns, usually by uneven wind currents that favor the formation of these varieties. The variety &quot;radiatus&quot; is associated with cloud rows of a particular type that appear to converge at the horizon. It is sometimes seen with the fibratus and uncinus species of cirrus, the stratiformis species of altocumulus and stratocumulus, the mediocris and sometimes humilis species of cumulus,{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2022|reason=is there a better source than tumblr? If reliable maybe add a hidden comment to say why}} and with the genus altostratus.
Another variety, &quot;duplicatus&quot; (closely spaced layers of the same type, one above the other), is sometimes found with cirrus of both the fibratus and uncinus species, and with altocumulus and stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and lenticularis. The variety &quot;undulatus&quot; (having a wavy undulating base) can occur with any clouds of the species stratiformis or lenticularis, and with altostratus. It is only rarely observed with stratus nebulosus. The variety &quot;lacunosus&quot; is caused by localized downdrafts that create circular holes in the form of a honeycomb or net. It is occasionally seen with cirrocumulus and altocumulus of the species stratiformis, castellanus, and floccus, and with stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and castellanus.

====Combinations====
It is possible for some species to show combined varieties at one time, especially if one variety is opacity-based and the other is pattern-based. An example of this would be a layer of altocumulus stratiformis arranged in seemingly converging rows separated by small breaks. The full technical name of a cloud in this configuration would be &quot;altocumulus stratiformis radiatus perlucidus&quot;, which would identify respectively its genus, species, and two combined varieties.

===Other types===
{{see also|List of cloud types}}

Supplementary features and accessory clouds are not further subdivisions of cloud types below the species and variety level. Rather, they are either &quot;hydrometeors&quot; or special cloud types with their own Latin names that form in association with certain cloud genera, species, and varieties. Supplementary features, whether in the form of clouds or precipitation, are directly attached to the main genus-cloud. Accessory clouds, by contrast, are generally detached from the main cloud.

====Precipitation-based supplementary features====
One group of supplementary features are not actual cloud formations, but precipitation that falls when water droplets or ice crystals that make up visible clouds have grown too heavy to remain aloft. &quot;Virga&quot; is a feature seen with clouds producing precipitation that evaporates before reaching the ground, these being of the genera cirrocumulus, altocumulus, altostratus, nimbostratus, stratocumulus, cumulus, and cumulonimbus.

When the precipitation reaches the ground without completely evaporating, it is designated as the feature &quot;praecipitatio&quot;. This normally occurs with altostratus opacus, which can produce widespread but usually light precipitation, and with thicker clouds that show significant vertical development. Of the latter, &quot;upward-growing&quot; cumulus mediocris produces only isolated light showers, while &quot;downward growing&quot; nimbostratus is capable of heavier, more extensive precipitation. Towering vertical clouds have the greatest ability to produce intense precipitation events, but these tend to be localized unless organized along fast-moving cold fronts. Showers of moderate to heavy intensity can fall from cumulus congestus clouds. Cumulonimbus, the largest of all cloud genera, has the capacity to produce very heavy showers. Low stratus clouds usually produce only light precipitation, but this always occurs as the feature praecipitatio due to the fact this cloud genus lies too close to the ground to allow for the formation of virga.

====Cloud-based supplementary features====
&quot;Incus&quot; is the most type-specific supplementary feature, seen only with cumulonimbus of the species capillatus. A cumulonimbus incus cloud top is one that has spread out into a clear anvil shape as a result of rising air currents hitting the stability layer at the tropopause where the air no longer continues to get colder with increasing altitude.

The &quot;mamma&quot; feature forms on the bases of clouds as downward-facing bubble-like protuberances caused by localized downdrafts within the cloud. It is also sometimes called &quot;mammatus&quot;, an earlier version of the term used before a standardization of Latin nomenclature brought about by the World Meteorological Organization during the 20th century. The best-known is cumulonimbus with mammatus, but the mamma feature is also seen occasionally with cirrus, cirrocumulus, altocumulus, altostratus, and stratocumulus.

A &quot;tuba&quot; feature is a cloud column that may hang from the bottom of a cumulus or cumulonimbus. A newly formed or poorly organized column might be comparatively benign, but can quickly intensify into a funnel cloud or tornado.

An &quot;arcus&quot; feature is a roll cloud with ragged edges attached to the lower front part of cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus that forms along the leading edge of a squall line or thunderstorm outflow. A large arcus formation can have the appearance of a dark menacing arch.

Several new supplementary features have been formally recognized by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The feature &quot;fluctus&quot; can form under conditions of strong atmospheric wind shear when a stratocumulus, altocumulus, or cirrus cloud breaks into regularly spaced crests. This variant is sometimes known informally as a Kelvin–Helmholtz (wave) cloud. This phenomenon has also been observed in cloud formations over other planets and even in the Sun&#x27;s atmosphere. Another highly disturbed but more chaotic wave-like cloud feature associated with stratocumulus or altocumulus cloud has been given the Latin name &quot;asperitas&quot;. The supplementary feature &quot;cavum&quot; is a circular fall-streak hole that occasionally forms in a thin layer of supercooled altocumulus or cirrocumulus. Fall streaks consisting of virga or wisps of cirrus are usually seen beneath the hole as ice crystals fall out to a lower altitude. This type of hole is usually larger than typical lacunosus holes. A &quot;murus&quot; feature is a cumulonimbus wall cloud with a lowering, rotating cloud base than can lead to the development of tornadoes. A &quot;cauda&quot; feature is a tail cloud that extends horizontally away from the murus cloud and is the result of air feeding into the storm.

====Accessory clouds====
Supplementary cloud formations detached from the main cloud are known as accessory clouds. The heavier precipitating clouds, nimbostratus, towering cumulus (cumulus congestus), and cumulonimbus typically see the formation in precipitation of the &quot;pannus&quot; feature, low ragged clouds of the genera and species cumulus fractus or stratus fractus.

A group of accessory clouds comprise formations that are associated mainly with upward-growing cumuliform and cumulonimbiform clouds of free convection. &quot;Pileus&quot; is a cap cloud that can form over a cumulonimbus or large cumulus cloud, whereas a &quot;velum&quot; feature is a thin horizontal sheet that sometimes forms like an apron around the middle or in front of the parent cloud. An accessory cloud recently officially recognized by the World meteorological Organization is the &quot;flumen&quot;, also known more informally as the &quot;beaver&#x27;s tail&quot;. It is formed by the warm, humid inflow of a super-cell thunderstorm, and can be mistaken for a tornado. Although the flumen can indicate a tornado risk, it is similar in appearance to pannus or scud clouds and does not rotate.

==== Mother clouds ====
Clouds initially form in clear air or become clouds when fog rises above surface level. The genus of a newly formed cloud is determined mainly by air mass characteristics such as stability and moisture content. If these characteristics change over time, the genus tends to change accordingly. When this happens, the original genus is called a &quot;mother cloud&quot;. If the mother cloud retains much of its original form after the appearance of the new genus, it is termed a &quot;genitus&quot; cloud. One example of this is &quot;stratocumulus cumulogenitus&quot;, a stratocumulus cloud formed by the partial spreading of a cumulus type when there is a loss of convective lift. If the mother cloud undergoes a complete change in genus, it is considered to be a &quot;mutatus&quot; cloud.
====Other genitus and mutatus clouds====

The genitus and mutatus categories have been expanded to include certain types that do not originate from pre-existing clouds. The term &quot;flammagenitus&quot; (Latin for &#x27;fire-made&#x27;) applies to cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus that are formed by large scale fires or volcanic eruptions. Smaller low-level &quot;pyrocumulus&quot; or &quot;fumulus&quot; clouds formed by contained industrial activity are now classified as cumulus &quot;homogenitus&quot; (Latin for &#x27;man-made&#x27;). Contrails formed from the exhaust of aircraft flying in the upper level of the troposphere can persist and spread into formations resembling cirrus which are designated cirrus &quot;homogenitus&quot;. If a cirrus homogenitus cloud changes fully to any of the high-level genera, they are termed cirrus, cirrostratus, or cirrocumulus &quot;homomutatus&quot;. Stratus cataractagenitus (Latin for &#x27;cataract-made&#x27;) are generated by the spray from waterfalls. &quot;Silvagenitus&quot; (Latin for &#x27;forest-made&#x27;) is a stratus cloud that forms as water vapor is added to the air above a forest canopy.

=== Large scale patterns ===

Sometimes certain atmospheric processes cause clouds to become organized into patterns that can cover large areas. These patterns are usually difficult to identify from surface level and are best seen from an aircraft or spacecraft.

==== Stratocumulus fields ====

Stratocumulus clouds can be organized into &quot;fields&quot; that take on certain specially classified shapes and characteristics. In general, these fields are more discernible from high altitudes than from ground level. They can often be found in the following forms:
* Actinoform, which resembles a leaf or a spoked wheel.
* Closed cell, which is cloudy in the center and clear on the edges, similar to a filled honeycomb.
* Open cell, which resembles an empty honeycomb, with clouds around the edges and clear, open space in the middle.

====Vortex streets====
{{Main|Karman vortex street}}
These patterns are formed from a phenomenon known as a Kármán vortex which is named after the engineer and fluid dynamicist Theodore von Kármán. Wind driven clouds, usually mid level altocumulus or high level cirrus, can form into parallel rows that follow the wind direction. When the wind and clouds encounter high elevation land features such as a vertically prominent islands, they can form eddies around the high land masses that give the clouds a twisted appearance.

== Distribution ==

===Convergence along low-pressure zones===
{{Main|Intertropical Convergence Zone|Extratropical cyclone|Cold front|Warm front}}


Although the local distribution of clouds can be significantly influenced by topography, the global prevalence of cloud cover in the troposphere tends to vary more by latitude. It is most prevalent in and along low pressure zones of surface tropospheric convergence which encircle the Earth close to the equator and near the 50th parallels of latitude in the northern and southern hemispheres. The adiabatic cooling processes that lead to the creation of clouds by way of lifting agents are all associated with convergence; a process that involves the horizontal inflow and accumulation of air at a given location, as well as the rate at which this happens.&lt;ref name=&quot;Convergence/divergence&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |last=Wei-hung, Leung |year=2010 |title=Meteorology Basics: Convergence and Divergence |url=http://www.hko.gov.hk/education/edu01met/wxphe/ele-condiv-e.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191026053144/http://www.hko.gov.hk/education/edu01met/wxphe/ele-condiv-e.htm |archive-date=26 October 2019 |access-date=8 December 2014 |publisher=Hong Kong Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the equator, increased cloudiness is due to the presence of the low-pressure Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) where very warm and unstable air promotes mostly cumuliform and cumulonimbiform clouds. Clouds of virtually any type can form along the mid-latitude convergence zones depending on the stability and moisture content of the air. These extratropical convergence zones are occupied by the polar fronts where air masses of polar origin meet and clash with those of tropical or subtropical origin. This leads to the formation of weather-making extratropical cyclones composed of cloud systems that may be stable or unstable to varying degrees according to the stability characteristics of the various airmasses that are in conflict.

===Divergence along high pressure zones===
{{Main|Subtropical ridge|Polar high}}

Divergence is the opposite of convergence. In the Earth&#x27;s troposphere, it involves the horizontal outflow of air from the upper part of a rising column of air, or from the lower part of a subsiding column often associated with an area or ridge of high pressure. Cloudiness tends to be least prevalent near the poles and in the subtropics close to the 30th parallels, north and south. The latter are sometimes referred to as the horse latitudes. The presence of a large-scale high-pressure subtropical ridge on each side of the equator reduces cloudiness at these low latitudes. Similar patterns also occur at higher latitudes in both hemispheres.

==Luminance, reflectivity, and coloration==

The luminance or brightness of a cloud is determined by how light is reflected, scattered, and transmitted by the cloud&#x27;s particles. Its brightness may also be affected by the presence of haze or photometeors such as halos and rainbows. In the troposphere, dense, deep clouds exhibit a high reflectance (70–95%) throughout the visible spectrum. Tiny particles of water are densely packed and sunlight cannot penetrate far into the cloud before it is reflected out, giving a cloud its characteristic white color, especially when viewed from the top. Cloud droplets tend to scatter light efficiently, so that the intensity of the solar radiation decreases with depth into the gases. As a result, the cloud base can vary from a very light to very-dark-gray depending on the cloud&#x27;s thickness and how much light is being reflected or transmitted back to the observer. High thin tropospheric clouds reflect less light because of the comparatively low concentration of constituent ice crystals or supercooled water droplets which results in a slightly off-white appearance. However, a thick dense ice-crystal cloud appears brilliant white with pronounced gray shading because of its greater reflectivity.

As a tropospheric cloud matures, the dense water droplets may combine to produce larger droplets. If the droplets become too large and heavy to be kept aloft by the air circulation, they will fall from the cloud as rain. By this process of accumulation, the space between droplets becomes increasingly larger, permitting light to penetrate farther into the cloud. If the cloud is sufficiently large and the droplets within are spaced far enough apart, a percentage of the light that enters the cloud is not reflected back out but is absorbed giving the cloud a darker look. A simple example of this is one&#x27;s being able to see farther in heavy rain than in heavy fog. This process of reflection/absorption is what causes the range of cloud color from white to black.

Striking cloud colorations can be seen at any altitude, with the color of a cloud usually being the same as the incident light. During daytime when the sun is relatively high in the sky, tropospheric clouds generally appear bright white on top with varying shades of gray underneath. Thin clouds may look white or appear to have acquired the color of their environment or background. Red, orange, and pink clouds occur almost entirely at sunrise/sunset and are the result of the scattering of sunlight by the atmosphere. When the Sun is just below the horizon, low-level clouds are gray, middle clouds appear rose-colored, and high clouds are white or off-white. Clouds at night are black or dark gray in a moonless sky, or whitish when illuminated by the Moon. They may also reflect the colors of large fires, city lights, or auroras that might be present.

A cumulonimbus cloud that appears to have a greenish or bluish tint is a sign that it contains extremely high amounts of water; hail or rain which scatter light in a way that gives the cloud a blue color. A green colorization occurs mostly late in the day when the sun is comparatively low in the sky and the incident sunlight has a reddish tinge that appears green when illuminating a very tall bluish cloud. Supercell type storms are more likely to be characterized by this but any storm can appear this way. Coloration such as this does not directly indicate that it is a severe thunderstorm, it only confirms its potential. Since a green/blue tint signifies copious amounts of water, a strong updraft to support it, high winds from the storm raining out, and wet hail; all elements that improve the chance for it to become severe, can all be inferred from this. In addition, the stronger the updraft is, the more likely the storm is to undergo tornadogenesis and to produce large hail and high winds.

Yellowish clouds may be seen in the troposphere in the late spring through early fall months during forest fire season. The yellow color is due to the presence of pollutants in the smoke. Yellowish clouds are caused by the presence of nitrogen dioxide and are sometimes seen in urban areas with high air pollution levels.

==Effects==
{{see also|Cloud cover|Cloud feedback|Global dimming|Climate change}}

Tropospheric clouds exert numerous influences on Earth&#x27;s troposphere and climate. First and foremost, they are the source of precipitation, thereby greatly influencing the distribution and amount of precipitation. Because of their differential buoyancy relative to surrounding cloud-free air, clouds can be associated with vertical motions of the air that may be convective, frontal, or cyclonic. The motion is upward if the clouds are less dense because condensation of water vapor releases heat, warming the air and thereby decreasing its density. This can lead to downward motion because lifting of the air results in cooling that increases its density. All of these effects are subtly dependent on the vertical temperature and moisture structure of the atmosphere and result in major redistribution of heat that affect the Earth&#x27;s climate.

The complexity and diversity of clouds in the troposphere is a major reason for difficulty in quantifying the effects of clouds on climate and climate change. On the one hand, white cloud tops promote cooling of Earth&#x27;s surface by reflecting shortwave radiation (visible and near infrared) from the Sun, diminishing the amount of solar radiation that is absorbed at the surface, enhancing the Earth&#x27;s albedo. Most of the sunlight that reaches the ground is absorbed, warming the surface, which emits radiation upward at longer, infrared, wavelengths. At these wavelengths, however, water in the clouds acts as an efficient absorber. The water reacts by radiating, also in the infrared, both upward and downward, and the downward longwave radiation results in increased warming at the surface. This is analogous to the greenhouse effect of greenhouse gases and water vapor.

High-level genus-types particularly show this duality with both short-wave albedo cooling and long-wave greenhouse warming effects. On the whole, &quot;ice-crystal&quot; clouds in the upper troposphere (cirrus) tend to favor net warming. However, the cooling effect is dominant with mid-level and low clouds, especially when they form in extensive sheets. Measurements by NASA indicate that on the whole, the effects of low and mid-level clouds that tend to promote cooling outweigh the warming effects of high layers and the variable outcomes associated with vertically developed clouds.

As difficult as it is to evaluate the influences of current clouds on current climate, it is even more problematic to predict changes in cloud patterns and properties in a future, warmer climate, and the resultant cloud influences on future climate. In a warmer climate more water would enter the atmosphere by evaporation at the surface; as clouds are formed from water vapor, cloudiness would be expected to increase. But in a warmer climate, higher temperatures would tend to evaporate clouds. Both of these statements are considered accurate, and both phenomena, known as cloud feedbacks, are found in climate model calculations. Broadly speaking, if clouds, especially low clouds, increase in a warmer climate, the resultant cooling effect leads to a negative feedback in climate response to increased greenhouse gases. But if low clouds decrease, or if high clouds increase, the feedback is positive. Differing amounts of these feedbacks are the principal reason for differences in climate sensitivities of current global climate models. As a consequence, much research has focused on the response of low and vertical clouds to a changing climate. Leading global models produce quite different results, however, with some showing increasing low clouds and others showing decreases. For these reasons the role of tropospheric clouds in regulating weather and climate remains a leading source of uncertainty in global warming projections.

== Stratospheric classification and distribution ==
Polar stratospheric clouds (PSC&#x27;s) are found in the lowest part of the stratosphere. Moisture is scarce above the troposphere, so nacreous and non-nacreous clouds at this altitude range are restricted to polar regions in the winter where and when the air is coldest.

PSC&#x27;s show some variation in structure according to their chemical makeup and atmospheric conditions, but are limited to a single very high range of altitude of about {{convert|15000|-|25000|m|abbr=on|-2}} Accordingly, they are classified as a singular type with no differentiated altitude levels, genus types, species, or varieties. There is no Latin nomenclature in the manner of tropospheric clouds, but rather descriptive names of several general forms using common English.

Supercooled nitric acid and water PSC&#x27;s, sometimes known as type 1, typically have a stratiform appearance resembling cirrostratus or haze, but because they are not frozen into crystals, do not show the pastel colors of the nacreous types. This type of PSC has been identified as a cause of ozone depletion in the stratosphere. The frozen nacreous types are typically very thin with mother-of-pearl colorations and an undulating cirriform or lenticular (stratocumuliform) appearance. These are sometimes known as type 2.

== Mesospheric classification and distribution ==
Noctilucent clouds are the highest in the atmosphere and are found near the top of the mesosphere at about {{convert|80|to|85|km|abbr=on}} or roughly ten times the altitude of tropospheric high clouds. They are given this Latin derived name because of their illumination well after sunset and before sunrise. They typically have a bluish or silvery white coloration that can resemble brightly illuminated cirrus. Noctilucent clouds may occasionally take on more of a red or orange hue. They are not common or widespread enough to have a significant effect on climate. However, an increasing frequency of occurrence of noctilucent clouds since the 19th century may be the result of climate change.

Ongoing research indicates that convective lift in the mesosphere is strong enough during the polar summer to cause adiabatic cooling of small amount of water vapor to the point of saturation. This tends to produce the coldest temperatures in the entire atmosphere just below the mesopause. There is evidence that smoke particles from burnt-up meteors provide much of the condensation nuclei required for the formation of noctilucent cloud.

Noctilucent clouds have four major types based on physical structure and appearance. Type I veils are very tenuous and lack well-defined structure, somewhat like cirrostratus fibratus or poorly defined cirrus. Type II bands are long streaks that often occur in groups arranged roughly parallel to each other. They are usually more widely spaced than the bands or elements seen with cirrocumulus clouds. Type III billows are arrangements of closely spaced, roughly parallel short streaks that mostly resemble cirrus. Type IV whirls are partial or, more rarely, complete rings of cloud with dark centers.

Distribution in the mesosphere is similar to the stratosphere except at much higher altitudes. Because of the need for maximum cooling of the water vapor to produce noctilucent clouds, their distribution tends to be restricted to polar regions of Earth. Sightings are rare more than 45 degrees south of the north pole or north of the south pole.

Cloud cover has been seen on most other planets in the Solar System. Venus&#x27;s thick clouds are composed of sulfur dioxide (due to volcanic activity) and appear to be almost entirely stratiform. They are arranged in three main layers at altitudes of 45 to 65 km that obscure the planet&#x27;s surface and can produce virga. No embedded cumuliform types have been identified, but broken stratocumuliform wave formations are sometimes seen in the top layer that reveal more continuous layer clouds underneath. On Mars, noctilucent, cirrus, cirrocumulus and stratocumulus composed of water-ice have been detected mostly near the poles. Water-ice fogs have also been detected on Mars.

Both Jupiter and Saturn have an outer cirriform cloud deck composed of ammonia, an intermediate stratiform haze-cloud layer made of ammonium hydrosulfide, and an inner deck of cumulus water clouds. Embedded cumulonimbus are known to exist near the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. The same category-types can be found covering Uranus and Neptune, but are all composed of methane. Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan has cirrus clouds believed to be composed largely of methane. The &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; Saturn mission uncovered evidence of polar stratospheric clouds and a methane cycle on Titan, including lakes near the poles and fluvial channels on the surface of the moon.

Some planets outside the Solar System are known to have atmospheric clouds. In October 2013, the detection of high altitude optically thick clouds in the atmosphere of exoplanet Kepler-7b was announced, and, in December 2013, in the atmospheres of GJ 436 b and GJ 1214 b.

==In culture and religion==

Clouds play an important mythical or non-scientific role in various cultures and religious traditions. The ancient Akkadians believed that the clouds (in meteorology, probably the supplementary feature &quot;mamma&quot;) were the breasts of the sky goddess Antu and that rain was milk from her breasts. In {{Bibleverse||Exodus|13:21–22|9}}, Yahweh is described as guiding the Israelites through the desert in the form of a &quot;pillar of cloud&quot; by day and a &quot;pillar of fire&quot; by night. In Mandaeism, uthras (celestial beings) are also occasionally mentioned as being in &quot;anana&quot; (&quot;clouds&quot;; e.g., in &quot;Right Ginza&quot; Book 17, Chapter 1), which can also be interpreted as female consorts.

&quot;The Cloud of Unknowing&quot; is a 14th-century work of Christian mysticism that advises a contemplative practice focused on experiencing God through love and &quot;unknowing.&quot;{{citation needed|date=August 2024}}

In the ancient Greek comedy &quot;The Clouds&quot;, written by Aristophanes and first performed at the City Dionysia in 423 BC, the philosopher Socrates declares that the Clouds are the only true deities and tells the main character Strepsiades not to worship any deities other than the Clouds, but to pay homage to them alone. In the play, the Clouds change shape to reveal the true nature of whoever is looking at them, turning into centaurs at the sight of a long-haired politician, wolves at the sight of the embezzler Simon, deer at the sight of the coward Cleonymus, and mortal women at the sight of the effeminate informer Cleisthenes. They are hailed the source of inspiration to comic poets and philosophers; they are masters of rhetoric, regarding eloquence and sophistry alike as their &quot;friends&quot;.

In China, clouds are symbols of luck and happiness. Overlapping clouds (in meteorology, probably &quot;duplicatus clouds&quot;) are thought to imply eternal happiness and clouds of different colors are said to indicate &quot;multiplied blessings&quot;.

Informal cloud watching or cloud gazing is a popular activity involving watching the clouds and looking for shapes in them, a form of pareidolia.

<text>Cloud feedback is a type of climate change feedback, where the overall cloud frequency, height, and the relative fraction of the different types of clouds are altered due to climate change, and these changes then affect the Earth&#x27;s energy balance. On their own, clouds are already an important part of the climate system, as they consist of water vapor, which acts as a greenhouse gas and so contributes to warming; at the same time, they are bright and reflective of the Sun, which causes cooling. Clouds at low altitudes have a stronger cooling effect, and those at high altitudes have a stronger warming effect. Altogether, clouds make the Earth cooler than it would have been without them.

If climate change causes low-level cloud cover to become more widespread, then these clouds will increase planetary albedo and contribute to cooling, making the overall cloud feedback &quot;negative&quot; (one that slows down the warming). But if clouds become higher and thinner due to climate change, then the net cloud feedback will be &quot;positive&quot; and accelerate the warming, as clouds will be less reflective and trap more heat in the atmosphere. These processes have been represented in every major climate model from the 1980s onwards. Observations and climate model results now provide &quot;high confidence&quot; that the overall cloud feedback on climate change is positive.

However, some cloud types are more difficult to observe, and so climate models have less data about them and make different estimates about their role. Thus, models can simulate cloud feedback as very positive or only weakly positive, and these disagreements are the main reason why climate models can have substantial differences in transient climate response and climate sensitivity. In particular, a minority of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models have made headlines before the publication of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) due to their high estimates of equilibrium climate sensitivity. This had occurred because they estimated cloud feedback as highly positive. Those particular models were soon found to contradict both observations and paleoclimate evidence, and the AR6 used a more realistic estimate based on the majority of the models and this real-world evidence instead.

One reason why it has been more difficult to find an exact value of cloud feedbacks when compared to the others is because humans affect clouds in another major way besides the warming from greenhouse gases. Small atmospheric sulfate particles, or aerosols, are generated due to the same sulfur-heavy air pollution which also causes acid rain, but they are also very reflective, to the point their concentrations in the atmosphere cause reductions in visible sunlight known as global dimming. These particles affect the clouds in multiple ways, mostly making them more reflective. This means that changes in clouds caused by aerosols can be confused for an evidence of negative cloud feedback, and separating the two effects has been difficult.

== Overview ==

Clouds have two major effects on the Earth&#x27;s energy budget: they reflect shortwave radiation from sunlight back to space due to their high albedo, but the water vapor contained inside them also absorbs and re-emits the longwave radiation sent out by the Earth&#x27;s surface as it is heated by sunlight, preventing its escape into space and retaining this heat energy for longer. 

In meteorology, the difference in the radiation budget caused by clouds, relative to cloud-free conditions, is described as the cloud radiative effect (CRE). This is also sometimes referred to as cloud radiative forcing (CRF). However, since cloud changes are not normally considered an external forcing of climate, CRE is the most commonly used term. 

At the top of the atmosphere, it can be described by the following equation

:formula_1

The net cloud radiative effect can be decomposed into its longwave and shortwave components. This is because net radiation is absorbed solar minus the outgoing longwave radiation shown by the following equations

:formula_2

The first term on the right is the shortwave cloud effect (&quot;Q&quot;abs ) and the second is the longwave effect (OLR).

The shortwave cloud effect is calculated by the following equation

:formula_3

Where &quot;S&quot;o is the solar constant, &quot;∝&quot;cloudy is the albedo with clouds and &quot;∝&quot;clear is the albedo on a clear day.

The longwave effect is calculated by the next following equation

:formula_4

Where σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature at the given height, and F is the upward flux in clear conditions.

Putting all of these pieces together, the final equation becomes

:formula_5

Under dry, cloud-free conditions, water vapor in atmosphere contributes 67% of the greenhouse effect on Earth. When there is enough moisture to form typical cloud cover, the greenhouse effect from &quot;free&quot; water vapor goes down to 50%, but water vapor which is now inside the clouds amounts to 25%, and the net greenhouse effect is at 75%. According to 1990 estimates, the presence of clouds reduces the outgoing longwave radiation by about 31 W/m2. However, it also increases the global albedo from 15% to 30%, and this reduces the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the Earth by about 44 W/m2. Thus, there is a net &quot;cooling&quot; of about 13 W/m2. If the clouds were removed with all else remaining the same, the Earth would lose this much cooling and the global temperatures would increase.

Climate change increases the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere due to the Clausius–Clapeyron relation, in what is known as the water-vapor feedback. It also affects a range of cloud properties, such as their height, the typical distribution throughout the atmosphere, and cloud microphysics, such as the amount of water droplets held, all of which then affect clouds&#x27; radiative forcing. Differences in those properties change the role of clouds in the Earth&#x27;s energy budget. The name &quot;cloud feedback&quot; refers to this relationship between climate change, cloud properties, and clouds&#x27; radiative forcing. Clouds also affect the magnitude of internally generated climate variability.

== Representation in climate models ==
Climate models have represented clouds and cloud processes for a very long time. Cloud feedback was already a standard feature in climate models designed in the 1980s. However, the physics of clouds are very complex, so models often represent various types of clouds in different ways, and even small variations between models can lead to significant changes in temperature and precipitation response. Climate scientists devote a lot of effort to resolving this issue. This includes the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project (CFMIP), where models simulate cloud processes under different conditions and their output is compared with the observational data. (AR6 WG1, Ch1, 223) When the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had published its Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) in 2021, the uncertainty range regarding cloud feedback strength became 50% smaller since the time of the AR5 in 2014. 

This happened because of major improvements in the understanding of cloud behaviour over the subtropical oceans. As the result, there was &quot;high confidence&quot; that the overall cloud feedback is positive (contributes to warming). The AR6 value for cloud feedback is +0.42 [–0.10 to 0.94] W m–2 per every in warming. This estimate is derived from multiple lines of evidence, including both models and observations. The tropical high-cloud amount feedback is the main remaining area for improvement. The only way total cloud feedback may still be slightly negative is if either this feedback, or the optical depth feedback in the Southern Ocean clouds is suddenly found to be &quot;extremely large&quot;; the probability of that is considered to be below 10%. As of 2024, most recent observations from the CALIPSO satellite instead indicate that the tropical cloud feedback is very weak.

In spite of these improvements, clouds remain the least well-understood climate feedback, and they are the main reason why models estimate differing values for equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS). ECS is an estimate of long-term (multi-century) warming in response to a &quot;doubling&quot; in -equivalent greenhouse gas concentrations: if the future emissions are not low, it also becomes the most important factor for determining 21st century temperatures. In general, the current generation of gold-standard climate models, CMIP6, operates with larger climate sensitivity than the previous generation, and this is largely because cloud feedback is about 20% more positive than it was in CMIP5.

However, the &quot;median&quot; cloud feedback is only slightly larger in CMIP6 than it was in CMIP5; the average is so much higher only because several &quot;hot&quot; models have much stronger cloud feedback and higher sensitivity than the rest. Those models have a sensitivity of and their presence had increased the median model sensitivity from in CMIP5 to in CMIP6. These model results had attracted considerable attention when they were first published in 2019, as they would have meant faster and more severe warming if they were accurate. It was soon found that the output of those &quot;hot&quot; models is inconsistent with both observations and paleoclimate evidence, so the consensus AR6 value for cloud feedback is smaller than the mean model output alone. The best estimate of climate sensitivity in AR6 is at , as this is in a better agreement with observations and paleoclimate findings.

== Role of aerosols ==
Atmospheric aerosols—fine partices suspended in the air—affect cloud formation and properties, which also alters their impact on climate. While some aerosols, such as black carbon particles, make the clouds darker and thus contribute to warming, by far the strongest effect is from sulfates, which increase the number of cloud droplets, making the clouds more reflective, and helping them cool the climate more. That is known as a &quot;direct&quot; aerosol effect; however, aerosols also have an &quot;indirect&quot; effect on liquid water path, and determining it involves computationally heavy continuous calculations of evaporation and condensation within clouds. Climate models generally assume that aerosols increase liquid water path, which makes the clouds even more reflective. However, satellite observations taken in 2010s suggested that aerosols decreased liquid water path instead, and in 2018, this was reproduced in a model which integrated more complex cloud microphysics. Yet, 2019 research found that earlier satellite observations were biased by failing to account for the thickest, most water-heavy clouds naturally raining more and shedding more particulates: very strong aerosol cooling was seen when comparing clouds of the same thickness.

Moreover, large-scale observations can be confounded by changes in other atmospheric factors, like humidity: i.e. it was found that while post-1980 improvements in air quality would have reduced the number of clouds over the East Coast of the United States by around 20%, this was offset by the increase in relative humidity caused by atmospheric response to AMOC slowdown. Similarly, while the initial research looking at sulfates from the 2014–2015 eruption of Bárðarbunga found that they caused no change in liquid water path, it was later suggested that this finding was confounded by counteracting changes in humidity. 

To avoid confounders, many observations of aerosol effects focus on ship tracks, but post-2020 research found that visible ship tracks are a poor proxy for other clouds, and estimates derived from them overestimate aerosol cooling by as much as 200%. At the same time, other research found that the majority of ship tracks are &quot;invisible&quot; to satellites, meaning that the earlier research had underestimated aerosol cooling by overlooking them. Finally, 2023 research indicates that all climate models have underestimated sulfur emissions from volcanoes which occur in the background, outside of major eruptions, and so had consequently overestimated the cooling provided by anthropogenic aerosols, especially in the Arctic climate.

Estimates of how much aerosols affect cloud cooling are very important, because the amount of sulfate aerosols in the air had undergone dramatic changes in the recent decades. First, it had increased greatly from 1950s to 1980s, largely due to the widespread burning of sulfur-heavy coal, which caused an observable reduction in visible sunlight that had been described as global dimming. Then, it started to decline substantially from the 1990s onwards and is expected to continue to decline in the future, due to the measures to combat acid rain and other impacts of air pollution. Consequently, the aerosols provided a considerable cooling effect which counteracted or &quot;masked&quot; some of the greenhouse effect from human emissions, and this effect had been declining as well, which contributed to acceleration of climate change.

Climate models do account for the presence of aerosols and their recent and future decline in their projections, and typically estimate that the cooling they provide in 2020s is similar to the warming from human-added atmospheric methane, meaning that simultaneous reductions in both would effectively cancel each other out. However, the existing uncertainty about aerosol-cloud interactions likewise introduces uncertainty into models, particularly when concerning predictions of changes in weather events over the regions with a poorer historical record of atmospheric observations.

== Possible break-up of equatorial stratocumulus clouds ==

In 2019, a study employed a large eddy simulation model to estimate that equatorial stratocumulus clouds could break up and scatter when  levels rise above 1,200 ppm (almost three times higher than the current levels, and over 4 times greater than the preindustrial levels). The study estimated that this would cause a surface warming of about globally and in the subtropics, which would be in addition to at least already caused by such concentrations. In addition, stratocumulus clouds would not reform until the concentrations drop to a much lower level. It was suggested that this finding could help explain past episodes of unusually rapid warming such as Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. In 2020, further work from the same authors revealed that in their large eddy simulation, this tipping point cannot be stopped with solar radiation modification: in a hypothetical scenario where very high emissions continue for a long time but are offset with extensive solar radiation modification, the break-up of stratocumulus clouds is simply delayed until concentrations hit 1,700 ppm, at which point it would still cause around of unavoidable warming.

However, because large eddy simulation models are simpler and smaller-scale than the general circulation models used for climate projections, with limited representation of atmospheric processes like subsidence, this finding is currently considered speculative. Other scientists say that the model used in that study unrealistically extrapolates the behavior of small cloud areas onto all cloud decks, and that it is incapable of simulating anything other than a rapid transition, with some comparing it to &quot;a knob with two settings&quot;. Additionally, concentrations would only reach 1,200 ppm if the world follows Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5, which represents the highest possible greenhouse gas emission scenario and involves a massive expansion of coal infrastructure. In that case, 1,200 ppm would be passed shortly after 2100.

<text>Coccolithophores, or coccolithophorids, are single-celled organisms which are part of the phytoplankton, the autotrophic (self-feeding) component of the plankton community. They form a group of about 200 species, and belong either to the kingdom Protista, according to Robert Whittaker&#x27;s five-kingdom system, or clade Hacrobia, according to a newer biological classification system. Within the Hacrobia, the coccolithophores are in the phylum or division Haptophyta, class Prymnesiophyceae (or Coccolithophyceae). Coccolithophores are almost exclusively marine, are photosynthetic and mixotrophic, and exist in large numbers throughout the sunlight zone of the ocean.

Coccolithophores are the most productive calcifying organisms on the planet, covering themselves with a calcium carbonate shell called a &quot;coccosphere&quot;. However, the reasons they calcify remain elusive. One key function may be that the coccosphere offers protection against microzooplankton predation, which is one of the main causes of phytoplankton death in the ocean.

Coccolithophores are ecologically important, and biogeochemically they play significant roles in the marine biological pump and the carbon cycle. Depending on habitat, they can produce up to 40 percent of the local marine primary production. They are of particular interest to those studying global climate change because, as ocean acidity increases, their coccoliths may become even more important as a carbon sink. Management strategies are being employed to prevent eutrophication-related coccolithophore blooms, as these blooms lead to a decrease in nutrient flow to lower levels of the ocean.

The most abundant species of coccolithophore, &quot;Emiliania huxleyi&quot;, belongs to the order Isochrysidales and family Noëlaerhabdaceae. It is found in temperate, subtropical, and tropical oceans. This makes &quot;E. huxleyi&quot; an important part of the planktonic base of a large proportion of marine food webs. It is also the fastest growing coccolithophore in laboratory cultures. It is studied for the extensive blooms it forms in nutrient depleted waters after the reformation of the summer thermocline. and for its production of molecules known as alkenones that are commonly used by earth scientists as a means to estimate past sea surface temperatures.

==Overview==
Coccolithophores (or coccolithophorids, from the adjective) form a group of about 200 phytoplankton species. They belong either to the kingdom Protista, according to Robert Whittaker&#x27;s Five kingdom classification, or clade Hacrobia, according to the newer biological classification system. Within the Hacrobia, the coccolithophores are in the phylum or division Haptophyta, class Prymnesiophyceae (or Coccolithophyceae). Coccolithophores are distinguished by special calcium carbonate plates (or scales) of uncertain function called &quot;coccoliths&quot;, which are also important microfossils. However, there are Prymnesiophyceae species lacking coccoliths (e.g. in genus &quot;Prymnesium&quot;), so not every member of Prymnesiophyceae is a coccolithophore.

Coccolithophores are single-celled phytoplankton that produce small calcium carbonate (CaCO3) scales (coccoliths) which cover the cell surface in the form of a spherical coating, called a coccosphere. Many species are also mixotrophs, and are able to photosynthesise as well as ingest prey.

Coccolithophores have been an integral part of marine plankton communities since the Jurassic. Today, coccolithophores contribute ~1–10% to inorganic carbon fixation (calcification) to total carbon fixation (calcification plus photosynthesis) in the surface ocean and ~50% to pelagic CaCO3 sediments. Their calcareous shell increases the sinking velocity of photosynthetically fixed into the deep ocean by ballasting organic matter. At the same time, the biogenic precipitation of calcium carbonate during coccolith formation reduces the total alkalinity of seawater and releases . Thus, coccolithophores play an important role in the marine carbon cycle by influencing the efficiency of the biological carbon pump and the oceanic uptake of atmospheric .

As of 2021, it is not known why coccolithophores calcify and how their ability to produce coccoliths is associated with their ecological success. The most plausible benefit of having a coccosphere seems to be a protection against predators or viruses. Viral infection is an important cause of phytoplankton death in the oceans, and it has recently been shown that calcification can influence the interaction between a coccolithophore and its virus. The major predators of marine phytoplankton are microzooplankton like ciliates and dinoflagellates. These are estimated to consume about two-thirds of the primary production in the ocean and microzooplankton can exert a strong grazing pressure on coccolithophore populations. Although calcification does not prevent predation, it has been argued that the coccosphere reduces the grazing efficiency by making it more difficult for the predator to utilise the organic content of coccolithophores. Heterotrophic protists are able to selectively choose prey on the basis of its size or shape and through chemical signals and may thus favor other prey that is available and not protected by coccoliths.

==Structure==
Coccolithophores are spherical cells about 5–100 micrometres across, enclosed by calcareous plates called coccoliths, which are about 2–25 micrometres across. Each cell contains two brown chloroplasts which surround the nucleus.

Enclosed in each coccosphere is a single cell with membrane bound organelles. Two large chloroplasts with brown pigment are located on either side of the cell and surround the nucleus, mitochondria, golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, and other organelles. Each cell also has two flagellar structures, which are involved not only in motility, but also in mitosis and formation of the cytoskeleton. In some species, a functional or vestigial haptonema is also present. This structure, which is unique to haptophytes, coils and uncoils in response to environmental stimuli. Although poorly understood, it has been proposed to be involved in prey capture. 
==Ecology==
===Life history strategy===
The complex life cycle of coccolithophores is known as a haplodiplontic life cycle, and is characterized by an alternation of both asexual and sexual phases. The asexual phase is known as the haploid phase, while the sexual phase is known as the diploid phase. During the haploid phase, coccolithophores produce haploid cells through mitosis. These haploid cells can then divide further through mitosis or undergo sexual reproduction with other haploid cells. The resulting diploid cell goes through meiosis to produce haploid cells again, starting the cycle over. With coccolithophores, asexual reproduction by mitosis is possible in both phases of the life cycle, which is a contrast with most other organisms that have alternating life cycles. Both abiotic and biotic factors may affect the frequency with which each phase occurs.

Coccolithophores reproduce asexually through binary fission. In this process the coccoliths from the parent cell are divided between the two daughter cells. There have been suggestions stating the possible presence of a sexual reproduction process due to the diploid stages of the coccolithophores, but this process has never been observed.

K or r- selected strategies of coccolithophores depend on their life cycle stage. When coccolithophores are diploid, they are r-selected. In this phase they tolerate a wider range of nutrient compositions. When they are haploid they are K- selected and are often more competitive in stable low nutrient environments. Most coccolithophores are K strategist and are usually found on nutrient-poor surface waters. They are poor competitors when compared to other phytoplankton and thrive in habitats where other phytoplankton would not survive. These two stages in the life cycle of coccolithophores occur seasonally, where more nutrition is available in warmer seasons and less is available in cooler seasons. This type of life cycle is known as a complex heteromorphic life cycle.

===Global distribution===
Coccolithophores occur throughout the world&#x27;s oceans. Their distribution varies vertically by stratified layers in the ocean and geographically by different temporal zones. While most modern coccolithophores can be located in their associated stratified oligotrophic conditions, the most abundant areas of coccolithophores where there is the highest species diversity are located in subtropical zones with a temperate climate. While water temperature and the amount of light intensity entering the water&#x27;s surface are the more influential factors in determining where species are located, the ocean currents also can determine the location where certain species of coccolithophores are found.

Although motility and colony formation vary according to the life cycle of different coccolithophore species, there is often alternation between a motile, haploid phase, and a non-motile diploid phase. In both phases, the organism&#x27;s dispersal is largely due to ocean currents and circulation patterns.

Within the Pacific Ocean, approximately 90 species have been identified with six separate zones relating to different Pacific currents that contain unique groupings of different species of coccolithophores. The highest diversity of coccolithophores in the Pacific Ocean was in an area of the ocean considered the Central North Zone which is an area between 30 oN and 5 oN, composed of the North Equatorial Current and the Equatorial Countercurrent. These two currents move in opposite directions, east and west, allowing for a strong mixing of waters and allowing a large variety of species to populate the area.

In the Atlantic Ocean, the most abundant species are &quot;E. huxleyi&quot; and &quot;Florisphaera profunda&quot; with smaller concentrations of the species &quot;Umbellosphaera&quot; &quot;irregularis&quot;, &quot;Umbellosphaera tenuis&quot; and different species of &quot;Gephyrocapsa&quot;. Deep-dwelling coccolithophore species abundance is greatly affected by nutricline and thermocline depths. These coccolithophores increase in abundance when the nutricline and thermocline are deep and decrease when they are shallow.

The complete distribution of coccolithophores is currently not known and some regions, such as the Indian Ocean, are not as well studied as other locations in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. It is also very hard to explain distributions due to multiple constantly changing factors involving the ocean&#x27;s properties, such as coastal and equatorial upwelling, frontal systems, benthic environments, unique oceanic topography, and pockets of isolated high or low water temperatures.
The upper photic zone is low in nutrient concentration, high in light intensity and penetration, and usually higher in temperature. The lower photic zone is high in nutrient concentration, low in light intensity and penetration and relatively cool. The middle photic zone is an area that contains the same values in between that of the lower and upper photic zones.

====Great Calcite Belt====

The Great Calcite Belt of the Southern Ocean is a region of elevated summertime upper ocean calcite concentration derived from coccolithophores, despite the region being known for its diatom predominance. The overlap of two major phytoplankton groups, coccolithophores and diatoms, in the dynamic frontal systems characteristic of this region provides an ideal setting to study environmental
influences on the distribution of different species within these taxonomic groups.

The Great Calcite Belt, defined as an elevated particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) feature occurring alongside seasonally elevated chlorophyll a in spring and summer in the Southern Ocean, plays an important role in climate fluctuations, accounting for over 60% of the Southern Ocean area (30–60° S). The region between 30° and 50° S has the highest uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) alongside the North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans.

====Effect of global climate change on distribution====
Recent studies show that climate change has direct and indirect impacts on Coccolithophore distribution and productivity. They will inevitably be affected by the increasing temperatures and thermal stratification of the top layer of the ocean, since these are prime controls on their ecology, although it is not clear whether global warming would result in net increase or decrease of coccolithophores. As they are calcifying organisms, it has been suggested that ocean acidification due to increasing carbon dioxide could severely affect coccolithophores. Recent increases have seen a sharp increase in the population of coccolithophores.

===Role in the food web===

Coccolithophores are one of the more abundant primary producers in the ocean. As such, they are a large contributor to the primary productivity of the tropical and subtropical oceans, however, exactly how much has yet to have been recorded.

====Dependence on nutrients====
The ratio between the concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus and silicate in particular areas of the ocean dictates competitive dominance within phytoplankton communities. Each ratio essentially tips the odds in favor of either diatoms or other groups of phytoplankton, such as coccolithophores. A low silicate to nitrogen and phosphorus ratio allows coccolithophores to outcompete other phytoplankton species; however, when silicate to phosphorus to nitrogen ratios are high coccolithophores are outcompeted by diatoms. The increase in agricultural processes lead to eutrophication of waters and thus, coccolithophore blooms in these high nitrogen and phosphorus, low silicate environments.

====Impact on water column productivity====
The calcite in calcium carbonate allows coccoliths to scatter more light than they absorb. This has two important consequences: 1) Surface waters become brighter, meaning they have a higher albedo, and 2) there is induced photoinhibition, meaning photosythetic production is diminished due to an excess of light. In case 1), a high concentration of coccoliths leads to a simultaneous increase in surface water temperature and decrease in the temperature of deeper waters. This results in more stratification in the water column and a decrease in the vertical mixing of nutrients. However, a 2012 study estimated that the overall effect of coccolithophores on the increase in radiative forcing of the ocean is less than that from anthropogenic factors. Therefore, the overall result of large blooms of coccolithophores is a decrease in water column productivity, rather than a contribution to global warming.

====Predator-prey interactions====
Their predators include the common predators of all phytoplankton including small fish, zooplankton, and shellfish larvae. Viruses specific to this species have been isolated from several locations worldwide and appear to play a major role in spring bloom dynamics.

=====Toxicity=====
No environmental evidence of coccolithophore toxicity has been reported, but they belong to the class Prymnesiophyceae which contain orders with toxic species. Toxic species have been found in the genera &quot;Prymnesium&quot; Massart and &quot;Chrysochromulina&quot; Lackey. Members of the genus &quot;Prymnesium&quot; have been found to produce haemolytic compounds, the agent responsible for toxicity. Some of these toxic species are responsible for large fish kills and can be accumulated in organisms such as shellfish; transferring it through the food chain. In laboratory tests for toxicity members of the oceanic coccolithophore genera &quot;Emiliania, Gephyrocapsa, Calcidiscus&quot; and &quot;Coccolithus&quot; were shown to be non-toxic as were species of the coastal genus &quot;Hymenomonas&quot;, however several species of &quot;Pleurochrysis&quot; and &quot;Jomonlithus&quot;, both coastal genera were toxic to &quot;Artemia&quot;.

===Community interactions===
Coccolithophorids are predominantly found as single, free-floating haploid or diploid cells.

====Competition====
Most phytoplankton need sunlight and nutrients from the ocean to survive, so they thrive in areas with large inputs of nutrient rich water upwelling from the lower levels of the ocean. Most coccolithophores require sunlight only for energy production, and have a higher ratio of nitrate uptake over ammonium uptake (nitrogen is required for growth and can be used directly from nitrate but not ammonium). Because of this they thrive in still, nutrient-poor environments where other phytoplankton are starving. Trade-offs associated with these faster growth rates include a smaller cell radius and lower cell volume than other types of phytoplankton.

===Viral infection and coevolution===
Giant DNA-containing viruses are known to lytically infect coccolithophores, particularly &quot;E. huxleyi&quot;. These viruses, known as E. huxleyi viruses (EhVs), appear to infect the coccosphere coated diploid phase of the life cycle almost exclusively. It has been proposed that as the haploid organism is not infected and therefore not affected by the virus, the co-evolutionary &quot;arms race&quot; between coccolithophores and these viruses does not follow the classic Red Queen evolutionary framework, but instead a &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; ecological dynamic. More recent work has suggested that viral synthesis of sphingolipids and induction of programmed cell death provides a more direct link to study a Red Queen-like coevolutionary arms race at least between the coccolithoviruses and diploid organism.

==Evolution and diversity==
Coccolithophores are members of the clade Haptophyta, which is a sister clade to Centrohelida, which are both in Haptista. The oldest known coccolithophores are known from the Late Triassic, around the Norian-Rhaetian boundary. Diversity steadily increased over the course of the Mesozoic, reaching its apex during the Late Cretaceous. However, there was a sharp drop during the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, when more than 90% of coccolithophore species became extinct. Coccoliths reached another, lower apex of diversity during the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum, but have subsequently declined since the Oligocene due to decreasing global temperatures, with species that produced large and heavily calcified coccoliths most heavily affected.

==Coccolithophore shells==

* Exoskeleton: coccospheres and coccoliths

Each coccolithophore encloses itself in a protective shell of coccoliths, calcified scales which make up its exoskeleton or coccosphere. The coccoliths are created inside the coccolithophore cell and while some species maintain a single layer throughout life only producing new coccoliths as the cell grows, others continually produce and shed coccoliths.

=== Composition ===
The primary constituent of coccoliths is calcium carbonate, or chalk. Calcium carbonate is transparent, so the organisms&#x27; photosynthetic activity is not compromised by encapsulation in a coccosphere.

=== Formation ===
Coccoliths are produced by a biomineralization process known as coccolithogenesis. Generally, calcification of coccoliths occurs in the presence of light, and these scales are produced much more during the exponential phase of growth than the stationary phase. Although not yet entirely understood, the biomineralization process is tightly regulated by calcium signaling. Calcite formation begins in the golgi complex where protein templates nucleate the formation of CaCO3 crystals and complex acidic polysaccharides control the shape and growth of these crystals. As each scale is produced, it is exported in a Golgi-derived vesicle and added to the inner surface of the coccosphere. This means that the most recently produced coccoliths may lie beneath older coccoliths.
Depending upon the phytoplankton&#x27;s stage in the life cycle, two different types of coccoliths may be formed. Holococcoliths are produced only in the haploid phase, lack radial symmetry, and are composed of anywhere from hundreds to thousands of similar minute (ca 0.1 μm) rhombic calcite crystals. These crystals are thought to form at least partially outside the cell. Heterococcoliths occur only in the diploid phase, have radial symmetry, and are composed of relatively few complex crystal units (fewer than 100). Although they are rare, combination coccospheres, which contain both holococcoliths and heterococcoliths, have been observed in the plankton recording coccolithophore life cycle transitions. Finally, the coccospheres of some species are highly modified with various appendages made of specialized coccoliths.

=== Function ===
While the exact function of the coccosphere is unclear, many potential functions have been proposed. Most obviously coccoliths may protect the phytoplankton from predators. It also appears that it helps them to create a more stable pH. During photosynthesis carbon dioxide is removed from the water, making it more basic. Also calcification removes carbon dioxide, but chemistry behind it leads to the opposite pH reaction; it makes the water more acidic. The combination of photosynthesis and calcification therefore even out each other regarding pH changes. In addition, these exoskeletons may confer an advantage in energy production, as coccolithogenesis seems highly coupled with photosynthesis. Organic precipitation of calcium carbonate from bicarbonate solution produces free carbon dioxide directly within the cellular body of the alga, this additional source of gas is then available to the Coccolithophore for photosynthesis. It has been suggested that they may provide a cell-wall like barrier to isolate intracellular chemistry from the marine environment. More specific, defensive properties of coccoliths may include protection from osmotic changes, chemical or mechanical shock, and short-wavelength light. It has also been proposed that the added weight of multiple layers of coccoliths allows the organism to sink to lower, more nutrient rich layers of the water and conversely, that coccoliths add buoyancy, stopping the cell from sinking to dangerous depths. Coccolith appendages have also been proposed to serve several functions, such as inhibiting grazing by zooplankton.

=== Uses ===
Coccoliths are the main component of the Chalk, a Late Cretaceous rock formation which outcrops widely in southern England and forms the White Cliffs of Dover, and of other similar rocks in many other parts of the world. At the present day sedimented coccoliths are a major component of the calcareous oozes that cover up to 35% of the ocean floor and is kilometres thick in places. Because of their abundance and wide geographic ranges, the coccoliths which make up the layers of this ooze and the chalky sediment formed as it is compacted serve as valuable microfossils.
Calcification, the biological production of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), is a key process in the marine carbon cycle. Coccolithophores are the major planktonic group responsible for pelagic CaCO3 production. The diagram on the right shows the energetic costs of coccolithophore calcification:

: (A) Transport processes include the transport into the cell from the surrounding seawater of primary calcification substrates Ca2+ and HCO3− (black arrows) and the removal of the end product H+ from the cell (gray arrow). The transport of Ca2+ through the cytoplasm to the CV is the dominant cost associated with calcification.

: (B) Metabolic processes include the synthesis of CAPs (gray rectangles) by the Golgi complex (white rectangles) that regulate the nucleation and geometry of CaCO3 crystals. The completed coccolith (gray plate) is a complex structure of intricately arranged CAPs and CaCO3 crystals.

: (C) Mechanical and structural processes account for the secretion of the completed coccoliths that are transported from their original position adjacent to the nucleus to the cell periphery, where they are transferred to the surface of the cell. The costs associated with these processes are likely to be comparable to organic-scale exocytosis in noncalcifying haptophyte algae.

The diagram on the left shows the benefits of coccolithophore calcification. (A) Accelerated photosynthesis includes CCM (1) and enhanced light uptake via scattering of scarce photons for deep-dwelling species (2). (B) Protection from photodamage includes sunshade protection from ultraviolet (UV) light and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) (1) and energy dissipation under high-light conditions (2). (C) Armor protection includes protection against viral/bacterial infections (1) and grazing by selective (2) and nonselective (3) grazers.

The degree by which calcification can adapt to ocean acidification is presently unknown. Cell physiological examinations found the essential H+ efflux (stemming from the use of HCO3− for intra-cellular calcification) to become more costly with ongoing ocean acidification as the electrochemical H+ inside-out gradient is reduced and passive proton outflow impeded. Adapted cells would have to activate proton channels more frequently, adjust their membrane potential, and/or lower their internal pH. Reduced intra-cellular pH would severely affect the entire cellular machinery and require other processes (e.g. photosynthesis) to co-adapt in order to keep H+ efflux alive. The obligatory H+ efflux associated with calcification may therefore pose a fundamental constraint on adaptation which may potentially explain why &quot;calcification crisis&quot; were possible during long-lasting (thousands of years) CO2 perturbation events even though evolutionary adaption to changing carbonate chemistry conditions is possible within one year. Unraveling these fundamental constraints and the limits of adaptation should be a focus in future coccolithophore studies because knowing them is the key information required to understand to what extent the calcification response to carbonate chemistry perturbations can be compensated by evolution.

Silicate- or cellulose-armored functional groups such as diatoms and dinoflagellates do not need to sustain the calcification-related H+ efflux. Thus, they probably do not need to adapt in order to keep costs for the production of structural elements low. On the contrary, dinoflagellates (except for calcifying species; with generally inefficient CO2-fixing RuBisCO enzymes may even profit from chemical changes since photosynthetic carbon fixation as their source of structural elements in the form of cellulose should be facilitated by the ocean acidification-associated CO2 fertilization. Under the assumption that any form of shell/exoskeleton protects phytoplankton against predation non-calcareous armors may be the preferable solution to realize protection in a future ocean.

The diagram on the right is a representation of how the comparative energetic effort for armor construction in diatoms, dinoflagellates and coccolithophores appear to operate. The frustule (diatom shell) seems to be the most inexpensive armor under all circumstances because diatoms typically outcompete all other groups when silicate is available. The coccosphere is relatively inexpensive under sufficient [CO2], high [HCO3−], and low [H+] because the substrate is saturating and protons are easily released into seawater. In contrast, the construction of thecal elements, which are organic (cellulose) plates that constitute the dinoflagellate shell, should rather be favored at high H+ concentrations because these usually coincide with high [CO2]. Under these conditions dinoflagellates could down-regulate the energy-consuming operation of carbon concentrating mechanisms to fuel the production of organic source material for their shell. Therefore, a shift in carbonate chemistry conditions toward high [CO2] may promote their competitiveness relative to coccolithophores. However, such a hypothetical gain in competitiveness due to altered carbonate chemistry conditions would not automatically lead to dinoflagellate dominance because a huge number of factors other than carbonate chemistry have an influence on species composition as well.

===Defence against predation===

Currently, the evidence supporting or refuting a protective function of the coccosphere against predation is limited. Some researchers found that overall microzooplankton predation rates were reduced during blooms of the coccolithophore &quot;Emiliania huxleyi&quot;, while others found high microzooplankton grazing rates on natural coccolithophore communities. In 2020, researchers found that &quot;in situ&quot; ingestion rates of microzooplankton on &quot;E. huxleyi&quot; did not differ significantly from those on similar sized non-calcifying phytoplankton. In laboratory experiments the heterotrophic dinoflagellate &quot;Oxyrrhis marina&quot; preferred calcified over non-calcified cells of &quot;E. huxleyi&quot;, which was hypothesised to be due to size selective feeding behaviour, since calcified cells are larger than non-calcified &quot;E. huxleyi&quot;. In 2015, Harvey et al. investigated predation by the dinoflagellate &quot;O. marina&quot; on different genotypes of non-calcifying &quot;E. huxleyi&quot; as well as calcified strains that differed in the degree of calcification. They found that the ingestion rate of &quot;O. marina&quot; was dependent on the genotype of &quot;E. huxleyi&quot; that was offered, rather than on their degree of calcification. In the same study, however, the authors found that predators which preyed on non-calcifying genotypes grew faster than those fed with calcified cells. In 2018, Strom et al. compared predation rates of the dinoflagellate &quot;Amphidinium longum&quot; on calcified relative to naked &quot;E. huxleyi&quot; prey and found no evidence that the coccosphere prevents ingestion by the grazer. Instead, ingestion rates were dependent on the offered genotype of E. huxleyi. Altogether, these two studies suggest that the genotype has a strong influence on ingestion by the microzooplankton species, but if and how calcification protects coccolithophores from microzooplankton predation could not be fully clarified.

==Importance in global climate change==
===Impact on the carbon cycle===
Coccolithophores have both long and short term effects on the carbon cycle. The production of coccoliths requires the uptake of dissolved inorganic carbon and calcium. Calcium carbonate and carbon dioxide are produced from calcium and bicarbonate by the following chemical reaction:

Because coccolithophores are photosynthetic organisms, they are able to use some of the released in the calcification reaction for photosynthesis.

However, the production of calcium carbonate drives surface alkalinity down, and in conditions of low alkalinity the is instead released back into the atmosphere.
As a result of this, researchers have postulated that large blooms of coccolithophores may contribute to global warming in the short term. A more widely accepted idea, however, is that over the long term coccolithophores contribute to an overall decrease in atmospheric concentrations. During calcification two carbon atoms are taken up and one of them becomes trapped as calcium carbonate. This calcium carbonate sinks to the bottom of the ocean in the form of coccoliths and becomes part of sediment; thus, coccolithophores provide a sink for emitted carbon, mediating the effects of greenhouse gas emissions.

===Evolutionary responses to ocean acidification===
Research also suggests that ocean acidification due to increasing concentrations of in the atmosphere may affect the calcification machinery of coccolithophores. This may not only affect immediate events such as increases in population or coccolith production, but also may induce evolutionary adaptation of coccolithophore species over longer periods of time. For example, coccolithophores use H+ ion channels in to constantly pump H+ ions out of the cell during coccolith production. This allows them to avoid acidosis, as coccolith production would otherwise produce a toxic excess of H+ ions. When the function of these ion channels is disrupted, the coccolithophores stop the calcification process to avoid acidosis, thus forming a feedback loop. Low ocean alkalinity, impairs ion channel function and therefore places evolutionary selective pressure on coccolithophores and makes them (and other ocean calcifiers) vulnerable to ocean acidification. In 2008, field evidence indicating an increase in calcification of newly formed ocean sediments containing coccolithophores bolstered the first ever experimental data showing that an increase in ocean concentration results in an increase in calcification of these organisms.
Decreasing coccolith mass is related to both the increasing concentrations of and decreasing concentrations of in the world&#x27;s oceans. This lower calcification is assumed to put coccolithophores at ecological disadvantage. Some species like &quot;Calcidiscus&quot; &quot;leptoporus&quot;, however, are not affected in this way, while the most abundant coccolithophore species, &quot;E. huxleyi&quot; might be (study results are mixed). Also, highly calcified coccolithophorids have been found in conditions of low CaCO3 saturation contrary to predictions. Understanding the effects of increasing ocean acidification on coccolithophore species is absolutely essential to predicting the future chemical composition of the ocean, particularly its carbonate chemistry. Viable conservation and management measures will come from future research in this area. Groups like the European-based CALMARO are monitoring the responses of coccolithophore populations to varying pH&#x27;s and working to determine environmentally sound measures of control.

===Impact on microfossil record===
Coccolith fossils are prominent and valuable calcareous microfossils. They are the largest global source of biogenic calcium carbonate, and significantly contribute to the global carbon cycle. They are the main constituent of chalk deposits such as the white cliffs of Dover.

Of particular interest are fossils dating back to the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum 55 million years ago. This period is thought to correspond most directly to the current levels of in the ocean. Finally, field evidence of coccolithophore fossils in rock were used to show that the deep-sea fossil record bears a rock record bias similar to the one that is widely accepted to affect the land-based fossil record.

===Impact on the oceans===
The coccolithophorids help in regulating the temperature of the oceans. They thrive in warm seas and release dimethyl sulfide (DMS) into the air whose nuclei help to produce thicker clouds to block the sun. When the oceans cool, the number of coccolithophorids decrease and the amount of clouds also decrease. When there are fewer clouds blocking the sun, the temperature also rises. This, therefore, maintains the balance and equilibrium of nature.

<text>Condensation is the change of the state of matter from the gas phase into the liquid phase, and is the reverse of vaporization. The word most often refers to the water cycle. It can also be defined as the change in the state of water vapor to liquid water when in contact with a liquid or solid surface or cloud condensation nuclei within the atmosphere. When the transition happens from the gaseous phase into the solid phase directly, the change is called deposition.

==Initiation==
Condensation is initiated by the formation of atomic/molecular clusters of that species within its gaseous volume—like rain drop or snow flake formation within clouds—or at the contact between such gaseous phase and a liquid or solid surface. In clouds, this can be catalyzed by water-nucleating proteins, produced by atmospheric microbes, which are capable of binding gaseous or liquid water molecules.
==Reversibility scenarios==
A few distinct reversibility scenarios emerge here with respect to the nature of the surface.
* absorption into the surface of a liquid (either of the same substance or one of its solvents)—is reversible as evaporation.
* adsorption (as dew droplets) onto solid surface at pressures and temperatures higher than the species&#x27; triple point—also reversible as evaporation.
* adsorption onto solid surface (as supplemental layers of solid) at pressures and temperatures lower than the species&#x27; triple point—is reversible as sublimation.

==Most common scenarios==
Condensation commonly occurs when a vapor is cooled and/or compressed to its saturation limit when the molecular density in the gas phase reaches its maximal threshold. Vapor cooling and compressing equipment that collects condensed liquids is called a &quot;condenser&quot;.
== Measurement ==
Psychrometry measures the rates of condensation through evaporation into the air moisture at various atmospheric pressures and temperatures. Water is the product of its vapor condensation—condensation is the process of such phase conversion.

== Applications of condensation ==

Condensation is a crucial component of distillation, an important laboratory and industrial chemistry application.

Because condensation is a naturally occurring phenomenon, it can often be used to generate water in large quantities for human use. Many structures are made solely for the purpose of collecting water from condensation, such as air wells and fog fences. Such systems can often be used to retain soil moisture in areas where active desertification is occurring—so much so that some organizations educate people living in affected areas about water condensers to help them deal effectively with the situation.

It is also a crucial process in forming particle tracks in a cloud chamber. In this case, ions produced by an incident particle act as nucleation centers for the condensation of the vapor producing the visible &quot;cloud&quot; trails.

Commercial applications of condensation, by consumers as well as industry, include power generation, water desalination, thermal management, refrigeration, and air conditioning.

== Biological adaptation ==
Numerous living beings use water made accessible by condensation. A few examples of these are the Australian thorny devil, the darkling beetles of the Namibian coast, and the coast redwoods of the West Coast of the United States.

==Condensation in building construction==

Condensation in building construction is an unwanted phenomenon as it may cause dampness, mold health issues, wood rot, corrosion, weakening of mortar and masonry walls, and energy penalties due to increased heat transfer. To alleviate these issues, the indoor air humidity needs to be lowered, or air ventilation in the building needs to be improved. This can be done in a number of ways, for example opening windows, turning on extractor fans, using dehumidifiers, drying clothes outside and covering pots and pans whilst cooking. Air conditioning or ventilation systems can be installed that help remove moisture from the air, and move air throughout a building. The amount of water vapor that can be stored in the air can be increased simply by increasing the temperature. However, this can be a double edged sword as most condensation in the home occurs when warm, moisture heavy air comes into contact with a cool surface. As the air is cooled, it can no longer hold as much water vapor. This leads to deposition of water on the cool surface. This is very apparent when central heating is used in combination with single glazed windows in winter.

Interstructure condensation may be caused by thermal bridges, insufficient or lacking insulation, damp proofing or insulated glazing.

<doc id="47525" wikidata="Q207546" url="?curid=47525" title="Contrail">
<text>Contrails (; short for &quot;condensation trails&quot;) or vapor trails are line-shaped clouds produced by aircraft engine exhaust or changes in air pressure, typically at aircraft cruising altitudes several kilometres/miles above the Earth&#x27;s surface. They are composed primarily of water, in the form of ice crystals. The combination of water vapor in aircraft engine exhaust and the low ambient temperatures at high altitudes causes the trails&#x27; formation. Impurities in the engine exhaust from the fuel, including soot and sulfur compounds (0.05% by weight in jet fuel) provide some of the particles that serve as cloud condensation nuclei for water droplet growth in the exhaust. If water droplets form, they can freeze to form ice particles that compose a contrail. Their formation can also be triggered by changes in air pressure in wingtip vortices, or in the air over the entire wing surface. Contrails, and other clouds caused directly by human activity, are called homogenitus.

The vapor trails produced by rockets are referred to as &quot;missile contrails&quot; or &quot;rocket contrails.&quot; The water vapor and aerosol that rockets emit promote the &quot;formation of ice clouds in ice supersaturated layers of the atmosphere.&quot; Missile contrail clouds mainly comprise &quot;metal oxide particles, high-temperature water vapor condensation particles, and other byproducts of engine combustion.&quot;

Depending on the temperature and humidity at the altitude where the contrails form, they may be visible for only a few seconds or minutes, or may persist for hours and spread to be several kilometres/miles wide, eventually resembling natural cirrus or altocumulus clouds. Persistent contrails are of particular interest to scientists because they increase the cloudiness of the atmosphere. The resulting cloud forms are formally described as homomutatus, and may resemble cirrus, cirrocumulus, or cirrostratus, and are sometimes called cirrus aviaticus. Some persistent spreading contrails contribute to climate change.

==Condensation trails as a result of engine exhaust==
Engine exhaust is predominantly made up of water and carbon dioxide, the combustion products of hydrocarbon fuels. Many other chemical byproducts of incomplete hydrocarbon fuel combustion, including volatile organic compounds, inorganic gases, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, oxygenated organics, alcohols, ozone and particles of soot have been observed at lower concentrations. The exact quality is a function of engine type and basic combustion engine function, with up to 30% of aircraft exhaust being unburned fuel. (Micron-sized metallic particles resulting from engine wear have also been detected.) At high altitudes as this water vapor emerges into a cold environment, the localized increase in water vapor can raise the relative humidity of the air past saturation point. The vapor then condenses into tiny water droplets which freeze if the temperature is low enough. These millions of tiny water droplets and/or ice crystals form the contrails. The time taken for the vapor to cool enough to condense accounts for the contrail forming some distance behind the aircraft. At high altitudes, supercooled water vapor requires a trigger to encourage deposition or condensation. The exhaust particles in the aircraft&#x27;s exhaust act as this trigger, causing the trapped vapor to condense rapidly. Exhaust contrails usually form at high altitudes; usually above , where the air temperature is below . They can also form closer to the ground when the air is cold and moist.

A 2013–2014 study jointly supported by NASA, the German aerospace center DLR, and Canada&#x27;s National Research Council NRC, determined that biofuels could reduce contrail generation. This reduction was explained by demonstrating that biofuels produce fewer soot particles, which are the nuclei around which the ice crystals form. The tests were performed by flying a DC-8 at cruising altitude with a sample-gathering aircraft flying in trail. In these samples, the contrail-producing soot particle count was reduced by 50 to 70 percent, using a 50% blend of conventional Jet A1 fuel and HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids) biofuel produced from camelina.

==Condensation from decreases in pressure==

As a wing generates lift, it causes a vortex to form at the wingtip, and at the tip of the flap when deployed (wingtips and flap boundaries represent discontinuities in airflow). These wingtip vortices persist in the atmosphere long after the aircraft has passed. The reduction in pressure and temperature across each vortex can cause water to condense and make the cores of the wingtip vortices visible; this effect is more common on humid days. Wingtip vortices can sometimes be seen behind the wing flaps of airliners during takeoff and landing, and during Space Shuttle landings.

The visible cores of wingtip vortices contrast with the other major type of contrails which are caused by the combustion of fuel. Contrails produced from jet engine exhaust are seen at high altitude, directly behind each engine. By contrast, the visible cores of wingtip vortices are usually seen only at low altitude where the aircraft is travelling slowly after takeoff or before landing, and where the ambient humidity is higher; they trail behind the wingtips and wing flaps rather than behind the engines.

At high-thrust settings the fan blades at the intake of a turbofan engine reach transonic speeds, causing a sudden drop in air pressure. This creates the condensation fog (inside the intake) which is often observed by air travelers during takeoff.

The tips of rotating surfaces (such as propellers and rotors) sometimes produce visible contrails.

In firearms, a vapor trail is sometimes observed when firing under rare conditions, due to condensation induced by changes in air pressure around the bullet. A vapor trail from a bullet is observable from any direction. Vapor trail should not be confused with bullet trace, a refractive effect due to changes in air pressure as the bullet travels, which is a much more common phenomenon (and is usually only observable directly from behind the shooter).

==Impacts on climate==

It is considered that the largest contribution of aviation to climate change comes from contrails. 
In general, aircraft contrails trap outgoing longwave radiation emitted by the Earth and atmosphere more than they reflect incoming solar radiation, resulting in a net increase in radiative forcing. In 1992, this warming effect was estimated between 3.5 mW/m2 and 17 mW/m2.
In 2009, its 2005 value was estimated at 12 mW/m2, based on the reanalysis data, climate models, and radiative transfer codes; with an uncertainty range of 5 to 26 mW/m2, and with a low level of scientific understanding. 

Contrail cirrus may be air traffic&#x27;s largest radiative forcing component, larger than all accumulated from aviation, and could triple from a 2006 baseline to 160–180 mW/m2 by 2050 without intervention. For comparison, the total radiative forcing from human activities amounted to 2.72 W/m2 (with a range between 1.96 and 3.48W/m2) in 2019, and the increase from 2011 to 2019 alone amounted to 0.34W/m2. Contrail effects differ a lot depending on when they are formed, as they decrease the daytime temperature and increase the nighttime temperature, reducing their difference. In 2006, it was estimated that night flights contribute 60 to 80% of contrail radiative forcing while accounting for 25% of daily air traffic, and winter flights contribute half of the annual mean radiative forcing while accounting for 22% of annual air traffic.

Starting from the 1990s, it was suggested that contrails during daytime have a strong cooling effect, and when combined with the warming from night-time flights, this would lead to a substantial diurnal temperature variation (the difference in the day&#x27;s highs and lows at a fixed station). When no commercial aircraft flew across the USA following the September 11 attacks, the diurnal temperature variation was widened by . Measured across 4,000 weather stations in the continental United States, this increase was the largest recorded in 30 years. Without contrails, the local diurnal temperature range was higher than immediately before. In the southern US, the difference was diminished by about , and by in the US midwest. However, follow-up studies found that a natural change in cloud cover can more than explain these findings. The authors of a 2008 study wrote, &quot;The variations in high cloud cover, including contrails and contrail-induced cirrus clouds, contribute weakly to the changes in the diurnal temperature range, which is governed primarily by lower altitude clouds, winds, and humidity.&quot; 

In 2011, a study of British meteorological records taken during World War II identified one event where the temperature was higher than the day&#x27;s average near airbases used by USAAF strategic bombers after they flew in a formation. However, its authors cautioned that this was a single event, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions from it. Then, the global response to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic led to a reduction in global air traffic of nearly 70% relative to 2019. Thus, it provided an extended opportunity to study the impact of contrails on regional and global temperature. Multiple studies found &quot;no significant response of diurnal surface air temperature range&quot; as the result of contrail changes, and either &quot;no net significant global ERF&quot; (effective radiative forcing) or a very small warming effect. 

An EU project launched in 2020 aims to assess the feasibility of minimising contrail effects by the operational choices in making flight plans. Other similar projects include ContrailNet from Eurocontrol, Reviate, and the Ciconia project, as well as Google&#x27;s &#x27;project contrails&#x27;.

==Head-on contrails==
A contrail from an airplane flying towards the observer can appear to be generated by an object moving vertically. On 8 November 2010 in the US state of California, a contrail of this type gained media attention as a &quot;mystery missile&quot; that could not be explained by U.S. military and aviation authorities, and its explanation as a contrail took more than 24 hours to become accepted by U.S. media and military institutions.

==Distrails==
Where an aircraft passes through a cloud, it can disperse the cloud in its path. This is known as a distrail (short for &quot;dissipation trail&quot;). The plane&#x27;s warm engine exhaust and enhanced vertical mixing in the aircraft&#x27;s wake can cause existing cloud droplets to evaporate. If the cloud is sufficiently thin, such processes can yield a cloud-free corridor in an otherwise solid cloud layer. An early satellite observation of distrails that most likely were elongated, aircraft-induced fallstreak holes appeared in Corfidi and Brandli (1986).

Clouds form when invisible water vapor condenses into microscopic water droplets or into microscopic ice crystals. This may happen when air with a high proportion of gaseous water cools. A distrail forms when the heat of engine exhaust evaporates the liquid water droplets in a cloud, turning them back into invisible, gaseous water vapor. Distrails also may arise as a result of enhanced mixing (entrainment) of drier air immediately above or below a thin cloud layer following passage of an aircraft through the cloud, as shown in the second image below:

<text>Convection is single or multiphase fluid flow that occurs spontaneously through the combined effects of material property heterogeneity and body forces on a fluid, most commonly density and gravity (see buoyancy). When the cause of the convection is unspecified, convection due to the effects of thermal expansion and buoyancy can be assumed. Convection may also take place in soft solids or mixtures where particles can flow.

Convective flow may be transient (such as when a multiphase mixture of oil and water separates) or steady state (see convection cell). The convection may be due to gravitational, electromagnetic or fictitious body forces. Heat transfer by natural convection plays a role in the structure of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, its oceans, and its mantle. Discrete convective cells in the atmosphere can be identified by clouds, with stronger convection resulting in thunderstorms. Natural convection also plays a role in stellar physics. Convection is often categorised or described by the main effect causing the convective flow; for example, thermal convection.

Convection cannot take place in most solids because neither bulk current flows nor significant diffusion of matter can take place. 
Granular convection is a similar phenomenon in granular material instead of fluids.
Advection is fluid motion created by velocity instead of thermal gradients.
Convective heat transfer is the intentional use of convection as a method for heat transfer. Convection is a process in which heat is carried from place to place by the bulk movement of a fluid and gases.

==History==
In the 1830s, in &quot;The Bridgewater Treatises&quot;, the term &quot;convection&quot; is attested in a scientific sense. In treatise VIII by William Prout, in the book on chemistry, it says:

[...] This motion of heat takes place in three ways, which a common fire-place very well illustrates. If, for instance, we place a thermometer directly before a fire, it soon begins to rise, indicating an increase of temperature. In this case the heat has made its way through the space between the fire and the thermometer, by the process termed &quot;radiation&quot;. If we place a second thermometer in contact with any part of the grate, and away from the direct influence of the fire, we shall find that this thermometer also denotes an increase of temperature; but here the heat must have travelled through the metal of the grate, by what is termed &quot;conduction&quot;. Lastly, a third thermometer placed in the chimney, away from the direct influence of the fire, will also indicate a considerable increase of temperature; in this case a portion of the air, passing through and near the fire, has become heated, and has &quot;carried&quot; up the chimney the temperature acquired from the fire. There is at present no single term in our language employed to denote this third mode of the propagation of heat; but we venture to propose for that purpose, the term &quot;convection&quot;, [in footnote: [Latin] &quot;Convectio&quot;, a carrying or conveying] which not only expresses the leading fact, but also accords very well with the two other terms.
Later, in the same treatise VIII, in the book on meteorology, the concept of convection is also applied to &quot;the process by which heat is communicated through water&quot;.

==Terminology==
Today, the word &quot;convection&quot; has different but related usages in different scientific or engineering contexts or applications.

In fluid mechanics, &quot;convection&quot; has a broader sense: it refers to the motion of fluid driven by density (or other property) difference.

In thermodynamics, &quot;convection&quot; often refers to heat transfer by convection, where the prefixed variant Natural Convection is used to distinguish the fluid mechanics concept of Convection (covered in this article) from convective heat transfer.

Some phenomena which result in an effect superficially similar to that of a convective cell may also be (inaccurately) referred to as a form of convection; for example, thermo-capillary convection and granular convection.

==Mechanisms==
Convection may happen in fluids at all scales larger than a few atoms. There are a variety of circumstances in which the forces required for convection arise, leading to different types of convection, described below. In broad terms, convection arises because of body forces acting within the fluid, such as gravity.

===Natural convection===

Natural convection is a flow whose motion is caused by some parts of a fluid being heavier than other parts. In most cases this leads to natural circulation: the ability of a fluid in a system to circulate continuously under gravity, with transfer of heat energy.

The driving force for natural convection is gravity. In a column of fluid, pressure increases with depth from the weight of the overlying fluid. The pressure at the bottom of a submerged object then exceeds that at the top, resulting in a net upward buoyancy force equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. Objects of higher density than that of the displaced fluid then sink. For example, regions of warmer low-density air rise, while those of colder high-density air sink. This creates a circulating flow: convection.

Gravity drives natural convection. Without gravity, convection does not occur, so there is no convection in free-fall (inertial) environments, such as that of the orbiting International Space Station. Natural convection can occur when there are hot and cold regions of either air or water, because both water and air become less dense as they are heated. But, for example, in the world&#x27;s oceans it also occurs due to salt water being heavier than fresh water, so a layer of salt water on top of a layer of fresher water will also cause convection.

Natural convection has attracted a great deal of attention from researchers because of its presence both in nature and engineering applications. In nature, convection cells formed from air raising above sunlight-warmed land or water are a major feature of all weather systems. Convection is also seen in the rising plume of hot air from fire, plate tectonics, oceanic currents (thermohaline circulation) and sea-wind formation (where upward convection is also modified by Coriolis forces). In engineering applications, convection is commonly visualized in the formation of microstructures during the cooling of molten metals, and fluid flows around shrouded heat-dissipation fins, and solar ponds. A very common industrial application of natural convection is free air cooling without the aid of fans: this can happen on small scales (computer chips) to large scale process equipment.

Natural convection will be more likely and more rapid with a greater variation in density between the two fluids, a larger acceleration due to gravity that drives the convection or a larger distance through the convecting medium. Natural convection will be less likely and less rapid with more rapid diffusion (thereby diffusing away the thermal gradient that is causing the convection) or a more viscous (sticky) fluid.

The onset of natural convection can be determined by the Rayleigh number (Ra).

Differences in buoyancy within a fluid can arise for reasons other than temperature variations, in which case the fluid motion is called gravitational convection (see below). However, all types of buoyant convection, including natural convection, do not occur in microgravity environments. All require the presence of an environment which experiences g-force (proper acceleration).

The difference of density in the fluid is the key driving mechanism. If the differences of density are caused by heat, this force is called as &quot;thermal head&quot; or &quot;thermal driving head.&quot; A fluid system designed for natural circulation will have a heat source and a heat sink. Each of these is in contact with some of the fluid in the system, but not all of it. The heat source is positioned lower than the heat sink.

Most fluids expand when heated, becoming less dense, and contract when cooled, becoming denser. At the heat source of a system of natural circulation, the heated fluid becomes lighter than the fluid surrounding it, and thus rises. At the heat sink, the nearby fluid becomes denser as it cools, and is drawn downward by gravity. Together, these effects create a flow of fluid from the heat source to the heat sink and back again.

===Gravitational or buoyant convection===
Gravitational convection is a type of natural convection induced by buoyancy variations resulting from material properties other than temperature. Typically this is caused by a variable composition of the fluid. If the varying property is a concentration gradient, it is known as solutal convection. For example, gravitational convection can be seen in the diffusion of a source of dry salt downward into wet soil due to the buoyancy of fresh water in saline.

Variable salinity in water and variable water content in air masses are frequent causes of convection in the oceans and atmosphere which do not involve heat, or else involve additional compositional density factors other than the density changes from thermal expansion (see &quot;thermohaline circulation&quot;). Similarly, variable composition within the Earth&#x27;s interior which has not yet achieved maximal stability and minimal energy (in other words, with densest parts deepest) continues to cause a fraction of the convection of fluid rock and molten metal within the Earth&#x27;s interior (see below).

Gravitational convection, like natural thermal convection, also requires a g-force environment in order to occur.

===Solid-state convection in ice===
Ice convection on Pluto is believed to occur in a soft mixture of nitrogen ice and carbon monoxide ice. It has also been proposed for Europa, and other bodies in the outer Solar System.

===Thermomagnetic convection===

Thermomagnetic convection can occur when an external magnetic field is imposed on a ferrofluid with varying magnetic susceptibility. In the presence of a temperature gradient this results in a nonuniform magnetic body force, which leads to fluid movement. A ferrofluid is a liquid which becomes strongly magnetized in the presence of a magnetic field.

===Combustion===
In a zero-gravity environment, there can be no buoyancy forces, and thus no convection possible, so flames in many circumstances without gravity smother in their own waste gases. Thermal expansion and chemical reactions resulting in expansion and contraction gases allows for ventilation of the flame, as waste gases are displaced by cool, fresh, oxygen-rich gas. moves in to take up the low pressure zones created when flame-exhaust water condenses.

==Examples and applications==
Systems of natural circulation include tornadoes and other weather systems, ocean currents, and household ventilation. Some solar water heaters use natural circulation. The Gulf Stream circulates as a result of the evaporation of water. In this process, the water increases in salinity and density. In the North Atlantic Ocean, the water becomes so dense that it begins to sink down.

Convection occurs on a large scale in atmospheres, oceans, planetary mantles, and it provides the mechanism of heat transfer for a large fraction of the outermost interiors of the Sun and all stars. Fluid movement during convection may be invisibly slow, or it may be obvious and rapid, as in a hurricane. On astronomical scales, convection of gas and dust is thought to occur in the accretion disks of black holes, at speeds which may closely approach that of light.

===Demonstration experiments===

Thermal convection in liquids can be demonstrated by placing a heat source (for example, a Bunsen burner) at the side of a container with a liquid. Adding a dye to the water (such as food colouring) will enable visualisation of the flow.

Another common experiment to demonstrate thermal convection in liquids involves submerging open containers of hot and cold liquid coloured with dye into a large container of the same liquid without dye at an intermediate temperature (for example, a jar of hot tap water coloured red, a jar of water chilled in a fridge coloured blue, lowered into a clear tank of water at room temperature).

A third approach is to use two identical jars, one filled with hot water dyed one colour, and cold water of another colour. One jar is then temporarily sealed (for example, with a piece of card), inverted and placed on top of the other. When the card is removed, if the jar containing the warmer liquid is placed on top no convection will occur. If the jar containing colder liquid is placed on top, a convection current will form spontaneously.

Convection in gases can be demonstrated using a candle in a sealed space with an inlet and exhaust port. The heat from the candle will cause a strong convection current which can be demonstrated with a flow indicator, such as smoke from another candle, being released near the inlet and exhaust areas respectively.

===Double diffusive convection===
===Convection cells===

A convection cell, also known as a Bénard cell, is a characteristic fluid flow pattern in many convection systems. A rising body of fluid typically loses heat because it encounters a colder surface. In liquid, this occurs because it exchanges heat with colder liquid through direct exchange. In the example of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, this occurs because it radiates heat. Because of this heat loss the fluid becomes denser than the fluid underneath it, which is still rising. Since it cannot descend through the rising fluid, it moves to one side. At some distance, its downward force overcomes the rising force beneath it, and the fluid begins to descend. As it descends, it warms again and the cycle repeats itself. Additionally, convection cells can arise due to density variations resulting from differences in the composition of electrolytes.

===Atmospheric convection===
====Atmospheric circulation====

Atmospheric circulation is the large-scale movement of air, and is a means by which thermal energy is distributed on the surface of the Earth, together with the much slower (lagged) ocean circulation system. The large-scale structure of the atmospheric circulation varies from year to year, but the basic climatological structure remains fairly constant.

Latitudinal circulation occurs because incident solar radiation per unit area is highest at the heat equator, and decreases as the latitude increases, reaching minima at the poles. It consists of two primary convection cells, the Hadley cell and the polar vortex, with the Hadley cell experiencing stronger convection due to the release of latent heat energy by condensation of water vapor at higher altitudes during cloud formation.

Longitudinal circulation, on the other hand, comes about because the ocean has a higher specific heat capacity than land (and also thermal conductivity, allowing the heat to penetrate further beneath the surface ) and thereby absorbs and releases more heat, but the temperature changes less than land. This brings the sea breeze, air cooled by the water, ashore in the day, and carries the land breeze, air cooled by contact with the ground, out to sea during the night. Longitudinal circulation consists of two cells, the Walker circulation and El Niño / Southern Oscillation.
====Weather====

Some more localized phenomena than global atmospheric movement are also due to convection, including wind and some of the hydrologic cycle. For example, a foehn wind is a down-slope wind which occurs on the downwind side of a mountain range. It results from the adiabatic warming of air which has dropped most of its moisture on windward slopes. Because of the different adiabatic lapse rates of moist and dry air, the air on the leeward slopes becomes warmer than at the same height on the windward slopes.

A thermal column (or thermal) is a vertical section of rising air in the lower altitudes of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Thermals are created by the uneven heating of the Earth&#x27;s surface from solar radiation. The Sun warms the ground, which in turn warms the air directly above it. The warmer air expands, becoming less dense than the surrounding air mass, and creating a thermal low. The mass of lighter air rises, and as it does, it cools by expansion at lower air pressures. It stops rising when it has cooled to the same temperature as the surrounding air. Associated with a thermal is a downward flow surrounding the thermal column. The downward moving exterior is caused by colder air being displaced at the top of the thermal. Another convection-driven weather effect is the sea breeze.
Warm air has a lower density than cool air, so warm air rises within cooler air, similar to hot air balloons. Clouds form as relatively warmer air carrying moisture rises within cooler air. As the moist air rises, it cools, causing some of the water vapor in the rising packet of air to condense. When the moisture condenses, it releases energy known as latent heat of condensation which allows the rising packet of air to cool less than its surrounding air, continuing the cloud&#x27;s ascension. If enough instability is present in the atmosphere, this process will continue long enough for cumulonimbus clouds to form, which support lightning and thunder. Generally, thunderstorms require three conditions to form: moisture, an unstable airmass, and a lifting force (heat).

All thunderstorms, regardless of type, go through three stages: the developing stage, the mature stage, and the dissipation stage. The average thunderstorm has a diameter. Depending on the conditions present in the atmosphere, these three stages take an average of 30 minutes to go through.

===Oceanic circulation===

Solar radiation affects the oceans: warm water from the Equator tends to circulate toward the poles, while cold polar water heads towards the Equator. The surface currents are initially dictated by surface wind conditions. The trade winds blow westward in the tropics, and the westerlies blow eastward at mid-latitudes. This wind pattern applies a stress to the subtropical ocean surface with negative curl across the Northern Hemisphere, and the reverse across the Southern Hemisphere. The resulting Sverdrup transport is equatorward. Because of conservation of potential vorticity caused by the poleward-moving winds on the subtropical ridge&#x27;s western periphery and the increased relative vorticity of poleward moving water, transport is balanced by a narrow, accelerating poleward current, which flows along the western boundary of the ocean basin, outweighing the effects of friction with the cold western boundary current which originates from high latitudes. The overall process, known as western intensification, causes currents on the western boundary of an ocean basin to be stronger than those on the eastern boundary.

As it travels poleward, warm water transported by strong warm water current undergoes evaporative cooling. The cooling is wind driven: wind moving over water cools the water and also causes evaporation, leaving a saltier brine. In this process, the water becomes saltier and denser and decreases in temperature. Once sea ice forms, salts are left out of the ice, a process known as brine exclusion. These two processes produce water that is denser and colder. The water across the northern Atlantic Ocean becomes so dense that it begins to sink down through less salty and less dense water. (This open ocean convection is not unlike that of a lava lamp.) This downdraft of heavy, cold and dense water becomes a part of the North Atlantic Deep Water, a south-going stream.
===Mantle convection===

Mantle convection is the slow creeping motion of Earth&#x27;s rocky mantle caused by convection currents carrying heat from the interior of the Earth to the surface. It is one of 3 driving forces that causes tectonic plates to move around the Earth&#x27;s surface.

The Earth&#x27;s surface is divided into a number of tectonic plates that are continuously being created and consumed at their opposite plate boundaries. Creation (accretion) occurs as mantle is added to the growing edges of a plate. This hot added material cools down by conduction and convection of heat. At the consumption edges of the plate, the material has thermally contracted to become dense, and it sinks under its own weight in the process of subduction at an ocean trench. This subducted material sinks to some depth in the Earth&#x27;s interior where it is prohibited from sinking further. The subducted oceanic crust triggers volcanism.

Convection within Earth&#x27;s mantle is the driving force for plate tectonics. Mantle convection is the result of a thermal gradient: the lower mantle is hotter than the upper mantle, and is therefore less dense. This sets up two primary types of instabilities. In the first type, plumes rise from the lower mantle, and corresponding unstable regions of lithosphere drip back into the mantle. In the second type, subducting oceanic plates (which largely constitute the upper thermal boundary layer of the mantle) plunge back into the mantle and move downwards towards the core-mantle boundary. Mantle convection occurs at rates of centimeters per year, and it takes on the order of hundreds of millions of years to complete a cycle of convection.

Neutrino flux measurements from the Earth&#x27;s core (see kamLAND) show the source of about two-thirds of the heat in the inner core is the radioactive decay of 40K, uranium and thorium. This has allowed plate tectonics on Earth to continue far longer than it would have if it were simply driven by heat left over from Earth&#x27;s formation; or with heat produced from gravitational potential energy, as a result of physical rearrangement of denser portions of the Earth&#x27;s interior toward the center of the planet (that is, a type of prolonged falling and settling).
===Stack effect===

The Stack effect or chimney effect is the movement of air into and out of buildings, chimneys, flue gas stacks, or other containers due to buoyancy. Buoyancy occurs due to a difference in indoor-to-outdoor air density resulting from temperature and moisture differences. The greater the thermal difference and the height of the structure, the greater the buoyancy force, and thus the stack effect. The stack effect helps drive natural ventilation and infiltration. Some cooling towers operate on this principle; similarly the solar updraft tower is a proposed device to generate electricity based on the stack effect.

===Stellar physics===

The convection zone of a star is the range of radii in which energy is transported outward from the core region primarily by convection rather than radiation. This occurs at radii which are sufficiently opaque that convection is more efficient than radiation at transporting energy.

Granules on the photosphere of the Sun are the visible tops of convection cells in the photosphere, caused by convection of plasma in the photosphere. The rising part of the granules is located in the center where the plasma is hotter. The outer edge of the granules is darker due to the cooler descending plasma. A typical granule has a diameter on the order of 1,000 kilometers and each lasts 8 to 20 minutes before dissipating. Below the photosphere is a layer of much larger &quot;supergranules&quot; up to 30,000 kilometers in diameter, with lifespans of up to 24 hours.
===Water convection at freezing temperatures===
Water is a fluid that does not obey the Boussinesq approximation. This is because its density varies nonlinearly with temperature, which causes its thermal expansion coefficient to be inconsistent near freezing temperatures. The density of water reaches a maximum at 4 °C and decreases as the temperature deviates. This phenomenon is investigated by experiment and numerical methods. Water is initially stagnant at 10 °C within a square cavity. It is differentially heated between the two vertical walls, where the left and right walls are held at 10 °C and 0 °C, respectively. The density anomaly manifests in its flow pattern. As the water is cooled at the right wall, the density increases, which accelerates the flow downward. As the flow develops and the water cools further, the decrease in density causes a recirculation current at the bottom right corner of the cavity.

Another case of this phenomenon is the event of super-cooling, where the water is cooled to below freezing temperatures but does not immediately begin to freeze. Under the same conditions as before, the flow is developed. Afterward, the temperature of the right wall is decreased to −10 °C. This causes the water at that wall to become supercooled, create a counter-clockwise flow, and initially overpower the warm current. This plume is caused by a delay in the nucleation of the ice. Once ice begins to form, the flow returns to a similar pattern as before and the solidification propagates gradually until the flow is redeveloped.

===Nuclear reactors===
In a nuclear reactor, natural circulation can be a design criterion. It is achieved by reducing turbulence and friction in the fluid flow (that is, minimizing head loss), and by providing a way to remove any inoperative pumps from the fluid path. Also, the reactor (as the heat source) must be physically lower than the steam generators or turbines (the heat sink). In this way, natural circulation will ensure that the fluid will continue to flow as long as the reactor is hotter than the heat sink, even when power cannot be supplied to the pumps. Notable examples are the S5G

and S8G United States Naval reactors, which were designed to operate at a significant fraction of full power under natural circulation, quieting those propulsion plants. The S6G reactor cannot operate at power under natural circulation, but can use it to maintain emergency cooling while shut down.

By the nature of natural circulation, fluids do not typically move very fast, but this is not necessarily bad, as high flow rates are not essential to safe and effective reactor operation. In modern design nuclear reactors, flow reversal is almost impossible. All nuclear reactors, even ones designed to primarily use natural circulation as the main method of fluid circulation, have pumps that can circulate the fluid in the case that natural circulation is not sufficient.

==Mathematical models of convection==
A number of dimensionless terms have been derived to describe and predict convection, including the Archimedes number, Grashof number, Richardson number, and the Rayleigh number.

In cases of mixed convection (natural and forced occurring together) one would often like to know how much of the convection is due to external constraints, such as the fluid velocity in the pump, and how much is due to natural convection occurring in the system.

The relative magnitudes of the Grashof number and the square of the Reynolds number determine which form of convection dominates. If formula_1, forced convection may be neglected, whereas if formula_2, natural convection may be neglected. If the ratio, known as the Richardson number, is approximately one, then both forced and natural convection need to be taken into account.

===Onset===

The onset of natural convection is determined by the Rayleigh number (Ra). This dimensionless number is given by

:formula_3

where

*formula_4 is the difference in density between the two parcels of material that are mixing
*formula_5 is the local gravitational acceleration
*formula_6 is the characteristic length-scale of convection: the depth of the boiling pot, for example
*formula_7 is the diffusivity of the characteristic that is causing the convection, and
*formula_8 is the dynamic viscosity.

Natural convection will be more likely and/or more rapid with a greater variation in density between the two fluids, a larger acceleration due to gravity that drives the convection, and/or a larger distance through the convecting medium. Convection will be less likely and/or less rapid with more rapid diffusion (thereby diffusing away the gradient that is causing the convection) and/or a more viscous (sticky) fluid.

For thermal convection due to heating from below, as described in the boiling pot above, the equation is modified for thermal expansion and thermal diffusivity. Density variations due to thermal expansion are given by:

:formula_9

where

*formula_10 is the reference density, typically picked to be the average density of the medium,
*formula_11 is the coefficient of thermal expansion, and
*formula_12 is the temperature difference across the medium.

The general diffusivity, formula_7, is redefined as a thermal diffusivity, formula_14.

:formula_15

Inserting these substitutions produces a Rayleigh number that can be used to predict thermal convection.

:formula_16

===Turbulence===
The tendency of a particular naturally convective system towards turbulence relies on the Grashof number (Gr).

:formula_17

In very sticky, viscous fluids (large &quot;ν&quot;), fluid motion is restricted, and natural convection will be non-turbulent.

Following the treatment of the previous subsection, the typical fluid velocity is of the order of formula_18, up to a numerical factor depending on the geometry of the system. Therefore, Grashof number can be thought of as Reynolds number with the velocity of natural convection replacing the velocity in Reynolds number&#x27;s formula. However In practice, when referring to the Reynolds number, it is understood that one is considering forced convection, and the velocity is taken as the velocity dictated by external constraints (see below).

===Behavior===
The Grashof number can be formulated for natural convection occurring due to a concentration gradient, sometimes termed thermo-solutal convection. In this case, a concentration of hot fluid diffuses into a cold fluid, in much the same way that ink poured into a container of water diffuses to dye the entire space. Then:

:formula_19

Natural convection is highly dependent on the geometry of the hot surface, various correlations exist in order to determine the heat transfer coefficient. 
A general correlation that applies for a variety of geometries is

: formula_20

The value of f4(Pr) is calculated using the following formula

: formula_21

Nu is the Nusselt number and the values of Nu0 and the characteristic length used to calculate Re are listed below (see also Discussion):
Warning: The values indicated for the Horizontal cylinder are wrong; see discussion.

==Natural convection from a vertical plate==
One example of natural convection is heat transfer from an isothermal vertical plate immersed in a fluid, causing the fluid to move parallel to the plate. This will occur in any system wherein the density of the moving fluid varies with position. These phenomena will only be of significance when the moving fluid is minimally affected by forced convection.

When considering the flow of fluid is a result of heating, the following correlations can be used, assuming the fluid is an ideal diatomic, has adjacent to a vertical plate at constant temperature and the flow of the fluid is completely laminar.

Num = 0.478(Gr0.25)

Mean Nusselt number = Num = hmL/k

where

*hm = mean coefficient applicable between the lower edge of the plate and any point in a distance L (W/m2. K)
*L = height of the vertical surface (m)
*k = thermal conductivity (W/m. K)

Grashof number = Gr = formula_22 

where

*g = gravitational acceleration (m/s2)
*L = distance above the lower edge (m)
*ts = temperature of the wall (K)
*t∞ = fluid temperature outside the thermal boundary layer (K)
*v = kinematic viscosity of the fluid (m2/s)
*T = absolute temperature (K)

When the flow is turbulent different correlations involving the Rayleigh Number (a function of both the Grashof number and the Prandtl number) must be used.

Note that the above equation differs from the usual expression for Grashof number because the value formula_11 has been replaced by its approximation formula_24, which applies for ideal gases only (a reasonable approximation for air at ambient pressure).

==Pattern formation==
Convection, especially Rayleigh–Bénard convection, where the convecting fluid is contained by two rigid horizontal plates, is a convenient example of a pattern-forming system.

When heat is fed into the system from one direction (usually below), at small values it merely diffuses (&quot;conducts&quot;) from below upward, without causing fluid flow. As the heat flow is increased, above a critical value of the Rayleigh number, the system undergoes a bifurcation from the stable &quot;conducting&quot; state to the &quot;convecting&quot; state, where bulk motion of the fluid due to heat begins. If fluid parameters other than density do not depend significantly on temperature, the flow profile is symmetric, with the same volume of fluid rising as falling. This is known as Boussinesq convection.

As the temperature difference between the top and bottom of the fluid becomes higher, significant differences in fluid parameters other than density may develop in the fluid due to temperature. An example of such a parameter is viscosity, which may begin to significantly vary horizontally across layers of fluid. This breaks the symmetry of the system, and generally changes the pattern of up- and down-moving fluid from stripes to hexagons, as seen at right. Such hexagons are one example of a convection cell.

As the Rayleigh number is increased even further above the value where convection cells first appear, the system may undergo other bifurcations, and other more complex patterns, such as spirals, may begin to appear.

<text>The cryosphere is an umbrella term for those portions of Earth&#x27;s surface where water is in solid form. This includes sea ice, ice on lakes or rivers, snow, glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets, and frozen ground (which includes permafrost). Thus, there is a overlap with the hydrosphere. The cryosphere is an integral part of the global climate system. It also has important feedbacks on the climate system. These feedbacks come from the cryosphere&#x27;s influence on surface energy and moisture fluxes, clouds, the water cycle, atmospheric and oceanic circulation.

Through these feedback processes, the cryosphere plays a significant role in the global climate and in climate model response to global changes. Approximately 10% of the Earth&#x27;s surface is covered by ice, but this is rapidly decreasing. Current reductions in the cryosphere (caused by climate change) are measurable in ice sheet melt, glaciers decline, sea ice decline, permafrost thaw and snow cover decrease.

== Definition and terminology ==
The cryosphere describes those portions of Earth&#x27;s surface where water is in solid form. Frozen water is found on the Earth&#x27;s surface primarily as snow cover, freshwater ice in lakes and rivers, sea ice, glaciers, ice sheets, and frozen ground and permafrost (permanently frozen ground). 

The cryosphere is one of five components of the climate system. The others are the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, the lithosphere and the biosphere.

The term &quot;cryosphere&quot; comes from the Greek word &quot;kryos&quot;, meaning &quot;cold&quot;, &quot;frost&quot; or &quot;ice&quot; and the Greek word &quot;sphaira&quot;, meaning &quot;globe&quot; or &quot;ball&quot;.

&quot;Cryospheric sciences&quot; is an umbrella term for the study of the cryosphere. As an interdisciplinary Earth science, many disciplines contribute to it, most notably geology, hydrology, and meteorology and climatology; in this sense, it is comparable to glaciology.

The term &quot;deglaciation&quot; describes the retreat of cryospheric features.

== Properties and interactions ==
There are several fundamental physical properties of snow and ice that modulate energy exchanges between the surface and the atmosphere. The most important properties are the surface reflectance (albedo), the ability to transfer heat (thermal diffusivity), and the ability to change state (latent heat). These physical properties, together with surface roughness, emissivity, and dielectric characteristics, have important implications for observing snow and ice from space. For example, surface roughness is often the dominant factor determining the strength of radar backscatter. Physical properties such as crystal structure, density, length, and liquid water content are important factors affecting the transfers of heat and water and the scattering of microwave energy.

=== Residence time and extent ===
The residence time of water in each of the cryospheric sub-systems varies widely. Snow cover and freshwater ice are essentially seasonal, and most sea ice, except for ice in the central Arctic, lasts only a few years if it is not seasonal. A given water particle in glaciers, ice sheets, or ground ice, however, may remain frozen for 10–100,000 years or longer, and deep ice in parts of East Antarctica may have an age approaching 1 million years.

Most of the world&#x27;s ice volume is in Antarctica, principally in the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. In terms of areal extent, however, Northern Hemisphere winter snow and ice extent comprise the largest area, amounting to an average 23% of hemispheric surface area in January. The large areal extent and the important climatic roles of snow and ice is related to their unique physical properties. This also indicates that the ability to observe and model snow and ice-cover extent, thickness, and physical properties (radiative and thermal properties) is of particular significance for climate research.

=== Surface reflectance ===
The surface reflectance of incoming solar radiation is important for the surface energy balance (SEB). It is the ratio of reflected to incident solar radiation, commonly referred to as albedo. Climatologists are primarily interested in albedo integrated over the shortwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (~300 to 3500 nm), which coincides with the main solar energy input. Typically, albedo values for non-melting snow-covered surfaces are high (~80–90%) except in the case of forests. 

The higher albedos for snow and ice cause rapid shifts in surface reflectivity in autumn and spring in high latitudes, but the overall climatic significance of this increase is spatially and temporally modulated by cloud cover. (Planetary albedo is determined principally by cloud cover, and by the small amount of total solar radiation received in high latitudes during winter months.) Summer and autumn are times of high-average cloudiness over the Arctic Ocean so the albedo feedback associated with the large seasonal changes in sea-ice extent is greatly reduced. It was found that snow cover exhibited the greatest influence on Earth&#x27;s radiative balance in the spring (April to May) period when incoming solar radiation was greatest over snow-covered areas.

=== Thermal properties of cryospheric elements ===
The thermal properties of cryospheric elements also have important climatic consequences. Snow and ice have much lower thermal diffusivities than air. Thermal diffusivity is a measure of the speed at which temperature waves can penetrate a substance. Snow and ice are many orders of magnitude less efficient at diffusing heat than air. Snow cover insulates the ground surface, and sea ice insulates the underlying ocean, decoupling the surface-atmosphere interface with respect to both heat and moisture fluxes. The flux of moisture from a water surface is eliminated by even a thin skin of ice, whereas the flux of heat through thin ice continues to be substantial until it attains a thickness in excess of 30 to 40 cm. However, even a small amount of snow on top of the ice will dramatically reduce the heat flux and slow down the rate of ice growth. The insulating effect of snow also has major implications for the hydrological cycle. In non-permafrost regions, the insulating effect of snow is such that only near-surface ground freezes and deep-water drainage is uninterrupted.

While snow and ice act to insulate the surface from large energy losses in winter, they also act to retard warming in the spring and summer because of the large amount of energy required to melt ice (the latent heat of fusion, 3.34 x 105 J/kg at 0 °C). However, the strong static stability of the atmosphere over areas of extensive snow or ice tends to confine the immediate cooling effect to a relatively shallow layer, so that associated atmospheric anomalies are usually short-lived and local to regional in scale. In some areas of the world such as Eurasia, however, the cooling associated with a heavy snowpack and moist spring soils is known to play a role in modulating the summer monsoon circulation.

=== Climate change feedback mechanisms ===

There are numerous cryosphere-climate feedbacks in the global climate system. These operate over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales from local seasonal cooling of air temperatures to hemispheric-scale variations in ice sheets over time scales of thousands of years. The feedback mechanisms involved are often complex and incompletely understood. For example, Curry &quot;et al.&quot; (1995) showed that the so-called &quot;simple&quot; sea ice-albedo feedback involved complex interactions with lead fraction, melt ponds, ice thickness, snow cover, and sea-ice extent.

The role of snow cover in modulating the monsoon is just one example of a short-term cryosphere-climate feedback involving the land surface and the atmosphere.

== Components ==

=== Glaciers and ice sheets ===


Ice sheets and glaciers are flowing ice masses that rest on solid land. They are controlled by snow accumulation, surface and basal melt, calving into surrounding oceans or lakes and internal dynamics. The latter results from gravity-driven creep flow (&quot;glacial flow&quot;) within the ice body and sliding on the underlying land, which leads to thinning and horizontal spreading. Any imbalance of this dynamic equilibrium between mass gain, loss and transport due to flow results in either growing or shrinking ice bodies.Relationships between global climate and changes in ice extent are complex. The mass balance of land-based glaciers and ice sheets is determined by the accumulation of snow, mostly in winter, and warm-season ablation due primarily to net radiation and turbulent heat fluxes to melting ice and snow from warm-air advection Where ice masses terminate in the ocean, iceberg calving is the major contributor to mass loss. In this situation, the ice margin may extend out into deep water as a floating ice shelf, such as that in the Ross Sea.


=== Sea ice ===

Sea ice covers much of the polar oceans and forms by freezing of sea water. Satellite data since the early 1970s reveal considerable seasonal, regional, and interannual variability in the sea ice covers of both hemispheres. Seasonally, sea-ice extent in the Southern Hemisphere varies by a factor of 5, from a minimum of 3–4 million km2 in February to a maximum of 17–20 million km2 in September. The seasonal variation is much less in the Northern Hemisphere where the confined nature and high latitudes of the Arctic Ocean result in a much larger perennial ice cover, and the surrounding land limits the equatorward extent of wintertime ice. Thus, the seasonal variability in Northern Hemisphere ice extent varies by only a factor of 2, from a minimum of 7–9 million km2 in September to a maximum of 14–16 million km2 in March.

The ice cover exhibits much greater regional-scale interannual variability than it does hemispherical. For instance, in the region of the Sea of Okhotsk and Japan, maximum ice extent decreased from 1.3 million km2 in 1983 to 0.85 million km2 in 1984, a decrease of 35%, before rebounding the following year to 1.2 million km2. The regional fluctuations in both hemispheres are such that for any several-year period of the satellite record some regions exhibit decreasing ice coverage while others exhibit increasing ice cover.

=== Frozen ground and permafrost ===
=== Snow cover ===

Most of the Earth&#x27;s snow-covered area is located in the Northern Hemisphere, and varies seasonally from 46.5 million km2 in January to 3.8 million km2 in August.

Snow cover is an extremely important storage component in the water balance, especially seasonal snowpacks in mountainous areas of the world. Though limited in extent, seasonal snowpacks in the Earth&#x27;s mountain ranges account for the major source of the runoff for stream flow and groundwater recharge over wide areas of the midlatitudes. For example, over 85% of the annual runoff from the Colorado River basin originates as snowmelt. Snowmelt runoff from the Earth&#x27;s mountains fills the rivers and recharges the aquifers that over a billion people depend on for their water resources.

Furthermore, over 40% of the world&#x27;s protected areas are in mountains, attesting to their value both as unique ecosystems needing protection and as recreation areas for humans.

=== Ice on lakes and rivers ===

Ice forms on rivers and lakes in response to seasonal cooling. The sizes of the ice bodies involved are too small to exert anything other than localized climatic effects. However, the freeze-up/break-up processes respond to large-scale and local weather factors, such that considerable interannual variability exists in the dates of appearance and disappearance of the ice. Long series of lake-ice observations can serve as a proxy climate record, and the monitoring of freeze-up and break-up trends may provide a convenient integrated and seasonally-specific index of climatic perturbations. Information on river-ice conditions is less useful as a climatic proxy because ice formation is strongly dependent on river-flow regime, which is affected by precipitation, snow melt, and watershed runoff as well as being subject to human interference that directly modifies channel flow, or that indirectly affects the runoff via land-use practices.

Lake freeze-up depends on the heat storage in the lake and therefore on its depth, the rate and temperature of any inflow, and water-air energy fluxes. Information on lake depth is often unavailable, although some indication of the depth of shallow lakes in the Arctic can be obtained from airborne radar imagery during late winter (Sellman &quot;et al.&quot; 1975) and spaceborne optical imagery during summer (Duguay and Lafleur 1997). The timing of breakup is modified by snow depth on the ice as well as by ice thickness and freshwater inflow.

==Changes caused by climate change==
===Ice sheet melt===


===Decline of glaciers===
===Sea ice decline===
===Permafrost thaw===
=== Snow cover decrease ===

Studies in 2021 found that Northern Hemisphere snow cover has been decreasing since 1978, along with snow depth. Paleoclimate observations show that such changes are unprecedented over the last millennia in Western North America.

North American winter snow cover increased during the 20th century, largely in response to an increase in precipitation.

Because of its close relationship with hemispheric air temperature, snow cover is an important indicator of climate change.

Global warming is expected to result in major changes to the partitioning of snow and rainfall, and to the timing of snowmelt, which will have important implications for water use and management. These changes also involve potentially important decadal and longer time-scale feedbacks to the climate system through temporal and spatial changes in soil moisture and runoff to the oceans.(Walsh 1995). Freshwater fluxes from the snow cover into the marine environment may be important, as the total flux is probably of the same magnitude as desalinated ridging and rubble areas of sea ice. In addition, there is an associated pulse of precipitated pollutants which accumulate over the Arctic winter in snowfall and are released into the ocean upon ablation of the sea ice.

<text>Cumulonimbus () is a dense, towering, vertical cloud, typically forming from water vapor condensing in the lower troposphere that builds upward carried by powerful buoyant air currents. Above the lower portions of the cumulonimbus the water vapor becomes ice crystals, such as snow and graupel, the interaction of which can lead to hail and to lightning formation, respectively.

When causing thunderstorms, these clouds may be called thunderheads. Cumulonimbus can form alone, in clusters, or along squall lines. These clouds are capable of producing lightning and other dangerous severe weather, such as tornadoes, hazardous winds, and large hailstones. Cumulonimbus progress from overdeveloped cumulus congestus clouds and may further develop as part of a supercell. Cumulonimbus is abbreviated as Cb.

== Description ==

Towering cumulonimbus clouds are typically accompanied by smaller cumulus clouds. The cumulonimbus base may extend several kilometres (miles) across, or be as small as several tens of metres (yards) across, and occupy low to upper altitudes within the troposphere - formed at altitude from approximately . Normal peaks usually reach to as much as , with unusually high ones typically topping out around and extreme instances claimed to be as high as or more. Well-developed cumulonimbus clouds are characterized by a flat, anvil shaped top (anvil dome), caused by wind shear or inversion at the equilibrium level near the tropopause. The shelf of the anvil may precede the main cloud&#x27;s vertical component for many kilometres (miles), and be accompanied by lightning. Occasionally, rising air parcels surpass the equilibrium level (due to momentum) and form an overshooting top culminating at the maximum parcel level. When vertically developed, this largest of all clouds usually extends through all three cloud regions. Even the smallest cumulonimbus cloud dwarfs its neighbors in comparison.

=== Subtypes ===

==== Species ====
* Cumulonimbus calvus: cloud with puffy top, similar to cumulus congestus which it develops from; under the correct conditions it can become a cumulonimbus capillatus.
* Cumulonimbus capillatus: cloud with cirrus-like, fibrous-edged top.

==== Types ====
* Cumulonimbus flammagenitus (pyrocumulonimbus): rapidly growing cloud forming from non-atmospheric heat and condensation nuclei sources such as wildfires and volcanic eruptions.
==== Supplementary features ====

=====Accessory clouds=====
* Arcus (including roll and shelf clouds): low, horizontal cloud formation associated with the leading edge of thunderstorm outflow.
* Pannus: accompanied by a lower layer of fractus species cloud forming in precipitation.
* Pileus (species calvus only): small cap-like cloud over parent cumulonimbus.
* Velum: a thin horizontal sheet that forms around the middle of a cumulonimbus.

=====Supplementary features=====
* Incus (species capillatus only): cumulonimbus with flat anvil-like cirriform top caused by wind shear where the rising air currents hit the inversion layer at the tropopause.
* Mamma or mammatus: consisting of bubble-like protrusions on the underside.
* Tuba: column hanging from the cloud base which can develop into a funnel cloud or tornado. They are known to drop very low, sometimes just above ground level.
* Flanking line is a line of small cumulonimbus or cumulus generally associated with severe thunderstorms.
* An overshooting top is a dome that rises above the thunderstorm; it is associated with severe weather.

=====Precipitation-based supplementary features=====
* Rain: precipitation that reaches the ground as liquid, often in a precipitation shaft.
* Virga: precipitation that evaporates before reaching the ground.

== Effects ==

Cumulonimbus storm cells can produce torrential rain of a convective nature (often in the form of a rain shaft) and flash flooding, as well as straight-line winds. Most storm cells die after about 20 minutes, when the precipitation causes more downdraft than updraft, causing the energy to dissipate. If there is sufficient instability and moisture in the atmosphere, however (on a hot summer day, for example), the outflowing moisture and gusts from one storm cell can lead to new cells forming just a few kilometres (miles) from the former one a few tens of minutes later or in some cases hundreds of kilometres (miles) away many hours later. This process cause thunderstorm formation (and decay) to last for several hours or even over multiple days. Cumulonimbus clouds can also occur as dangerous winter storms called &quot;thundersnow&quot; which are associated with particularly intense snowfall rates and with blizzard conditions when accompanied by strong winds that further reduce visibility. However, cumulonimbus clouds are most common in tropical regions and are also frequent in moist environments during the warm season in the middle latitudes. A dust storm caused by a cumulonimbus downburst is a haboob.

=== Hazards to aviation ===

Cumulonimbus are a notable hazard to aviation due most importantly to potent wind currents but also reduced visibility and lightning, as well as icing and hail if flying inside the cloud. Within and in the vicinity of thunderstorms there is significant turbulence and clear-air turbulence (particularly downwind), respectively. Wind shear within and under a cumulonimbus is often intense with downbursts being responsible for many accidents in earlier decades before training and technological detection and nowcasting measures were implemented. A small form of downburst, the microburst, is the most often implicated in crashes because of their rapid onset and swift changes in wind and aerodynamic conditions over short distances. Most downbursts are associated with visible precipitation shafts, however, dry microbursts are generally invisible to the naked eye. At least one fatal commercial airline accident was associated with flying through a tornado.

== Life cycle or stages ==
In general, cumulonimbus require moisture, an unstable air mass, and a lifting force in order to form. Cumulonimbus typically go through three stages: the developing stage, the mature stage (where the main cloud may reach supercell status in favorable conditions), and the dissipation stage. The average thunderstorm has a diameter and a height of approximately . Depending on the conditions present in the atmosphere, these three stages take an average of 30 minutes to go through.

<text>Cumulus clouds are clouds that have flat bases and are often described as puffy, cotton-like, or fluffy in appearance. Their name derives from the Latin , meaning &quot;heap&quot; or &quot;pile&quot;. Cumulus clouds are low-level clouds, generally less than in altitude unless they are the more vertical cumulus congestus form. Cumulus clouds may appear by themselves, in lines, or in clusters.

Cumulus clouds are often precursors of other types of clouds, such as cumulonimbus, when influenced by weather factors such as instability, humidity, and temperature gradient. Normally, cumulus clouds produce little or no precipitation, but they can grow into the precipitation-bearing cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus clouds. Cumulus clouds can be formed from water vapour, supercooled water droplets, or ice crystals, depending upon the ambient temperature. They come in many distinct subforms and generally cool the earth by reflecting the incoming solar radiation.

Cumulus clouds are part of the larger category of free-convective cumuliform clouds, which include cumulonimbus clouds. The latter genus-type is sometimes categorized separately as cumulonimbiform due to its more complex structure that often includes a cirriform or anvil top. There are also cumuliform clouds of limited convection that comprise stratocumulus (low-), altocumulus (middle-étage) and cirrocumulus (high-étage). These last three genus-types are sometimes classified separately as stratocumuliform.

== Formation ==

Cumulus clouds form via atmospheric convection as air warmed by the surface begins to rise. As the air rises, the temperature drops (following the lapse rate), causing the relative humidity (RH) to rise. If convection reaches a certain level the RH reaches one hundred percent, and the &quot;wet-adiabatic&quot; phase begins. At this point a positive feedback ensues: since the RH is above 100%, water vapor condenses, releasing latent heat, warming the air and spurring further convection.

In this phase, water vapor condenses on various nuclei present in the air, forming the cumulus cloud. This creates the characteristic flat-bottomed puffy shape associated with cumulus clouds. The height of the cloud (from its bottom to its top) depends on the temperature profile of the atmosphere and of the presence of any inversions. During the convection, surrounding air is entrained (mixed) with the thermal and the total mass of the ascending air increases.
Rain forms in a cumulus cloud via a process involving two non-discrete stages. The first stage occurs after the droplets coalesce onto the various nuclei. Langmuir writes that surface tension in the water droplets provides a slightly higher pressure on the droplet, raising the vapor pressure by a small amount. The increased pressure results in those droplets evaporating and the resulting water vapor condensing on the larger droplets. Due to the extremely small size of the evaporating water droplets, this process becomes largely meaningless after the larger droplets have grown to around 20 to 30 micrometres, and the second stage takes over. In the accretion phase, the raindrop begins to fall, and other droplets collide and combine with it to increase the size of the raindrop. Langmuir was able to develop a formula which predicted that the droplet radius would grow unboundedly within a discrete time period.

== Description ==

The liquid water density within a cumulus cloud has been found to change with height above the cloud base rather than being approximately constant throughout the cloud. In one particular study, the concentration was found to be zero at cloud base. As altitude increased, the concentration rapidly increased to the maximum concentration near the middle of the cloud. The maximum concentration was found to be anything up to 1.25 grams of water per kilogram of air. The concentration slowly dropped off as altitude increased to the height of the top of the cloud, where it immediately dropped to zero again.

Cumulus clouds can form in lines stretching over long called cloud streets. These cloud streets cover vast areas and may be broken or continuous. They form when wind shear causes horizontal circulation in the atmosphere, producing the long, tubular cloud streets. They generally form during high-pressure systems, such as after a cold front.

The height at which the cloud forms depends on the amount of moisture in the thermal that forms the cloud. Humid air will generally result in a lower cloud base. In temperate areas, the base of the cumulus clouds is usually below above ground level, but it can range up to in altitude. In arid and mountainous areas, the cloud base can be in excess of .

Cumulus clouds can be composed of ice crystals, water droplets, supercooled water droplets, or a mixture of them.

One study found that in temperate regions, the cloud bases studied ranged from above ground level. These clouds were normally above , and the concentration of droplets ranged from . This data was taken from growing isolated cumulus clouds that were not precipitating. The droplets were very small, ranging down to around 5 micrometres in diameter. Although smaller droplets may have been present, the measurements were not sensitive enough to detect them. The smallest droplets were found in the lower portions of the clouds, with the percentage of large droplets (around 20 to 30 micrometres) rising dramatically in the upper regions of the cloud. The droplet size distribution was slightly bimodal in nature, with peaks at the small and large droplet sizes and a slight trough in the intermediate size range. The skew was roughly neutral. Furthermore, large droplet size is roughly inversely proportional to the droplet concentration per unit volume of air. 

In places, cumulus clouds can have &quot;holes&quot; where there are no water droplets. These can occur when winds tear the cloud and incorporate the environmental air or when strong downdrafts evaporate the water.

=== Subforms ===

Cumulus clouds come in four distinct species, &quot;cumulus humilis&quot;, &quot;mediocris&quot;, &quot;congestus&quot;, and &quot;fractus&quot;. These species may be arranged into the variety, &quot;cumulus radiatus&quot;; and may be accompanied by up to seven supplementary features, &quot;cumulus pileus&quot;, &quot;velum&quot;, &quot;virga&quot;, &quot;praecipitatio&quot;, &quot;arcus&quot;, &quot;pannus&quot;, and &quot;tuba&quot;.

The species &quot;Cumulus fractus&quot; is ragged in appearance and can form in clear air as a precursor to cumulus humilis and larger cumulus species-types; or it can form in precipitation as the supplementary feature &quot;pannus&quot; (also called scud) which can also include stratus fractus of bad weather. &quot;Cumulus humilis&quot; clouds look like puffy, flattened shapes. &quot;Cumulus mediocris&quot; clouds look similar, except that they have some vertical development. &quot;Cumulus congestus&quot; clouds have a cauliflower-like structure and tower high into the atmosphere, hence their alternate name &quot;towering cumulus&quot;. The variety &quot;Cumulus radiatus&quot; forms in radial bands called cloud streets and can comprise any of the four species of cumulus.

Cumulus supplementary features are most commonly seen with the species congestus. &quot;Cumulus virga&quot; clouds are cumulus clouds producing virga (precipitation that evaporates while aloft), and &quot;cumulus praecipitatio&quot; produce precipitation that reaches the Earth&#x27;s surface. &quot;Cumulus pannus&quot; comprise shredded clouds that normally appear beneath the parent cumulus cloud during precipitation. &quot;Cumulus arcus&quot; clouds have a gust front, and &quot;cumulus tuba&quot; clouds have funnel clouds or tornadoes. &quot;Cumulus pileus&quot; clouds refer to cumulus clouds that have grown so rapidly as to force the formation of pileus over the top of the cloud. &quot;Cumulus velum&quot; clouds have an ice crystal veil over the growing top of the cloud.
There are also cumulus cataractagenitus, which are formed by waterfalls.

== Forecast ==
Cumulus humilis clouds usually indicate fair weather. Cumulus mediocris clouds are similar, except that they have some vertical development, which implies that they can grow into cumulus congestus or even cumulonimbus clouds, which can produce heavy rain, lightning, severe winds, hail, and even tornadoes. Cumulus congestus clouds, which appear as towers, will often grow into cumulonimbus storm clouds. They can produce precipitation. Glider pilots often pay close attention to cumulus clouds, as they can be indicators of rising air drafts or thermals underneath that can suck the plane high into the sky—a phenomenon known as cloud suck.

== Effects on climate ==

Due to reflectivity, clouds cool the earth by around , an effect largely caused by stratocumulus clouds. However, at the same time, they heat the earth by around by reflecting emitted radiation, an effect largely caused by cirrus clouds. This averages out to a net loss of . Cumulus clouds, on the other hand, have a variable effect on heating the Earth&#x27;s surface. The more vertical &quot;cumulus congestus&quot; species and cumulonimbus genus of clouds grow high into the atmosphere, carrying moisture with them, which can lead to the formation of cirrus clouds. The researchers speculated that this might even produce a positive feedback, where the increasing upper atmospheric moisture further warms the earth, resulting in an increasing number of &quot;cumulus congestus&quot; clouds carrying more moisture into the upper atmosphere.

== Relation to other clouds ==
Cumulus clouds are a genus of free-convective low-level cloud along with the related limited-convective cloud stratocumulus. These clouds form from ground level to at all latitudes. Stratus clouds are also low-level. In the middle level are the alto- clouds, which consist of the limited-convective stratocumuliform cloud altocumulus and the stratiform cloud altostratus. Mid-level clouds form from to in polar areas, in temperate areas, and in tropical areas. The high-level cloud, cirrocumulus, is a stratocumuliform cloud of limited convection. The other clouds in this level are cirrus and cirrostratus. High clouds form in high latitudes, in temperate latitudes, and in low, tropical latitudes. Cumulonimbus clouds, like cumulus congestus, extend vertically rather than remaining confined to one level.

=== Cirrocumulus clouds ===

Cirrocumulus clouds form in patches and cannot cast shadows. They commonly appear in regular, rippling patterns or in rows of clouds with clear areas between. Cirrocumulus are, like other members of the cumuliform and stratocumuliform categories, formed via convective processes. Significant growth of these patches indicates high-altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather. The ice crystals in the bottoms of cirrocumulus clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders. They are not solid, but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming in from the ends. Towards the top of the cloud, these crystals have a tendency to clump together. These clouds do not last long, and they tend to change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the ice crystals, they eventually begin to fall, destroying the upward convection. The cloud then dissipates into cirrus. Cirrocumulus clouds come in four species which are common to all three genus-types that have limited-convective or stratocumuliform characteristics: &quot;stratiformis&quot;, &quot;lenticularis&quot;, &quot;castellanus&quot;, and &quot;floccus&quot;. They are iridescent when the constituent supercooled water droplets are all about the same size.

=== Altocumulus clouds ===
Altocumulus clouds are a mid-level cloud that forms from high to in polar areas, in temperate areas, and in tropical areas. They can have precipitation and are commonly composed of a mixture of ice crystals, supercooled water droplets, and water droplets in temperate latitudes. However, the liquid water concentration was almost always significantly greater than the concentration of ice crystals, and the maximum concentration of liquid water tended to be at the top of the cloud while the ice concentrated itself at the bottom. The ice crystals in the base of the altocumulus clouds and in the virga were found to be dendrites or conglomerations of dendrites while needles and plates resided more towards the top. Altocumulus clouds can form via convection or via the forced uplift caused by a warm front.

=== Stratocumulus clouds ===
A stratocumulus cloud is another type of stratocumuliform cloud. Like cumulus clouds, they form at low levels and via convection. However, unlike cumulus clouds, their growth is almost completely retarded by a strong inversion. As a result, they flatten out like stratus clouds, giving them a layered appearance. These clouds are extremely common, covering on average around twenty-three percent of the Earth&#x27;s oceans and twelve percent of the Earth&#x27;s continents. They are less common in tropical areas and commonly form after cold fronts. Additionally, stratocumulus clouds reflect a large amount of the incoming sunlight, producing a net cooling effect. Stratocumulus clouds can produce drizzle, which stabilizes the cloud by warming it and reducing turbulent mixing.

=== Cumulonimbus clouds ===

Cumulonimbus clouds are the final form of growing cumulus clouds. They form when &quot;cumulus congestus&quot; clouds develop a strong updraft that propels their tops higher and higher into the atmosphere until they reach the tropopause at in altitude. Cumulonimbus clouds, commonly called thunderheads, can produce high winds, torrential rain, lightning, gust fronts, waterspouts, funnel clouds, and tornadoes. They commonly have anvil clouds.

=== Horseshoe clouds ===

A short-lived horseshoe cloud may occur when a horseshoe vortex deforms a cumulus cloud.

== Extraterrestrial ==
Some cumuliform and stratocumuliform clouds have been discovered on most other planets in the Solar System. On Mars, the Viking Orbiter detected cirrocumulus and stratocumulus clouds forming via convection primarily near the polar icecaps. The &quot;Galileo&quot; space probe detected massive cumulonimbus clouds near the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. Cumuliform clouds have also been detected on Saturn. In 2008, the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft determined that cumulus clouds near Saturn&#x27;s south pole were part of a cyclone over in diameter. The Keck Observatory detected whitish cumulus clouds on Uranus. Like Uranus, Neptune has methane cumulus clouds. Venus, however, does not appear to have cumulus clouds.

<doc id="47535" wikidata="Q500531" url="?curid=47535" title="Haptophyte">
<text>The haptophytes, classified either as the Haptophyta, Haptophytina or Prymnesiophyta (named for &quot;Prymnesium&quot;), are a clade of algae.

The names Haptophyceae or Prymnesiophyceae are sometimes used instead. This ending implies classification at the class rank rather than as a division. Although the phylogenetics of this group has become much better understood in recent years, there remains some dispute over which rank is most appropriate.

==Characteristics==
The chloroplasts are pigmented similarly to those of the heterokonts, but the structure of the rest of the cell is different, so it may be that they are a separate line whose chloroplasts are derived from similar red algal endosymbionts. Haptophyte chloroplasts contain chlorophylls a, c1, and c2 but lack chlorophyll b. For carotenoids, they have beta-, alpha-, and gamma- carotenes. Like diatoms and brown algae, they have also fucoxanthin, an oxidized isoprenoid derivative that is likely the most important driver of their brownish-yellow color.

The cells typically have two slightly unequal flagella, both of which are smooth, and a unique organelle called a haptonema, which is superficially similar to a flagellum but differs in the arrangement of microtubules and in its use. The name comes from the Greek &quot;hapsis&quot;, touch, and &quot;nema&quot;, round thread. The mitochondria have tubular cristae.

Most haptophytes reportedly produce chrysolaminarin rather than starch as their major storage polysaccharide, but some Pavlovaceae produce paramylon. The chain length of the chrysolaminarin is reportedly short (polymers of 20–50 glycosides, unlike the 300+ of comparable amylose), and it is located in cytoplasmic membrane-bound vacuoles.

==Significance==

The best-known haptophytes are coccolithophores, which make up 673 of the 762 described haptophyte species, and have an exoskeleton of calcareous plates called coccoliths. Coccolithophores are some of the most abundant marine phytoplankton, especially in the open ocean, and are extremely abundant as microfossils, forming chalk deposits. Other planktonic haptophytes of note include &quot;Chrysochromulina&quot; and &quot;Prymnesium&quot;, which periodically form toxic marine algal blooms, and &quot;Phaeocystis&quot;, blooms of which can produce unpleasant foam which often accumulates on beaches.

Haptophytes are economically important, as species such as &quot;Pavlova lutheri&quot; and &quot;Isochrysis sp.&quot; are widely used in the aquaculture industry to feed oyster and shrimp larvae. They contain a large amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), stearidonic acid and alpha-linolenic acid. &quot;Tisochrysis lutea&quot; contains betain lipids and phospholipids.

==Classification==

The haptophytes were first placed in the class Chrysophyceae (golden algae), but ultrastructural data have provided evidence to classify them separately. Both molecular and morphological evidence supports their division into five orders; coccolithophores make up the Isochrysidales and Coccolithales. Very small (2-3μm) uncultured pico-prymnesiophytes are ecologically important.

Haptophytes was discussed to be closely related to cryptomonads.

Haptophytes are closely related to the SAR clade.

<doc id="47541" wikidata="Q621230" url="?curid=47541" title="United Nations Security Council Resolution 242">
<text>United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 (S/RES/242) was adopted unanimously by the UN Security Council on November 22, 1967, in the aftermath of the Six-Day War. It was adopted under Chapter VI of the UN Charter. The resolution was sponsored by British ambassador Lord Caradon and was one of five drafts under consideration.

The preamble refers to the &quot;inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war and the need to work for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East in which every State in the area can live in security&quot;.

Operative Paragraph One &quot;Affirms that the fulfillment of Charter principles requires the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East which should include the application of both the following principles:

(i) Withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict;

(ii) Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgment of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force.&quot;
Egypt, Jordan, Israel and Lebanon entered into consultations with the UN Special representative over the implementation of 242. After denouncing it in 1967, Syria &quot;conditionally&quot; accepted the resolution in March 1972. Syria formally accepted UN Security Council Resolution 338, the cease-fire at the end of the Yom Kippur War (in 1973), which embraced Resolution 242. 

On 1 May 1968, the Israeli ambassador to the UN expressed Israel&#x27;s position to the Security Council: &quot;My government has indicated its acceptance of the Security Council resolution for the promotion of agreement on the establishment of a just and lasting peace. I am also authorized to reaffirm that we are willing to seek agreement with each Arab State on all matters included in that resolution.&quot;

Resolution 242 is one of the most widely affirmed resolutions on the Arab–Israeli conflict and formed the basis for later negotiations between the parties. These led to peace treaties between Israel and Egypt (1979) and Jordan (1994), as well as the 1993 and 1995 agreements with the Palestinians.

==Context==
The resolution is the formula proposed by the Security Council for the resolution of the Arab–Israeli conflict, in particular, ending the state of belligerency then existing between the &#x27;States concerned&#x27;, Israel and Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. The resolution deals with five principles; withdrawal of Israeli forces, &#x27;peace within secure and recognized boundaries&#x27;, freedom of navigation, a just settlement of the refugee problem and security measures including demilitarized zones. It also provided for the appointment of a Special Representative to proceed to the Middle East in order to promote agreement on a peaceful and accepted settlement in accordance with the principles outlined in the resolution.

Upon presenting the draft resolution to the Security Council, the U.K. representative Lord Caradon said:

United States secretary of state Dean Rusk commented on the most significant area of disagreement regarding the resolution:
There was much bickering over whether that resolution should say from &quot;the&quot; territories or from &quot;all&quot; territories. In the French version, which is equally authentic, it says withdrawal de territory, with de meaning &quot;the.&quot; We wanted that to be left a little vague and subject to future negotiation because we thought the Israeli border along the West Bank could be &quot;rationalized&quot;; certain anomalies could easily be straightened out with some exchanges of territory, making a more sensible border for all parties. We also wanted to leave open demilitarization measures in the Sinai and the Golan Heights and take a fresh look at the old city of Jerusalem. But we never contemplated any significant grant of territory to Israel as a result of the June 1967 war. On that point we and the Israelis to this day remain sharply divided. This situation could lead to real trouble in the future. Although every President since Harry Truman has committed the United States to the security and independence of Israel, I&#x27;m not aware of any commitment the United States has made to assist Israel in retaining territories seized in the Six-Day War.

A memorandum from the President&#x27;s Special Assistant, Walt Rostow, to President Johnson said: &quot;What&#x27;s on the Arab Ambassadors&#x27; minds boils down to one big question: Will we make good on our pledge to support the territorial integrity of all states in the Middle East? Our best answer is that we stand by that pledge, but the only way to make good on it is to have a genuine peace. The tough question is whether we&#x27;d force Israel back to 4 June borders if the Arabs accepted terms that amounted to an honest peace settlement. Secretary Rusk told the Yugoslav Foreign Minister: &#x27;The US had no problem with frontiers as they existed before the outbreak of hostilities. If we are talking about national frontiers—in a state of peace—then we will work toward restoring them.&#x27; But we all know that could lead to a tangle with the Israelis.&quot;

Rusk met with Foreign Minister Nikezic on August 30, 1967. However, according to telegram 30825 to Belgrade, September 1, which summarizes the conversation, Rusk said the key to a settlement was to end the state of war and belligerence and that if a way could be found to deal with this, other things would fall into place; the difference between pre-June 5 positions and secure national boundaries was an important difference.

President Johnson responded to a complaint from President Tito that Israel could change the frontiers without Arab consent: &quot;You note that the Arabs feel the US interprets the draft resolution to imply a change of frontiers to their detriment. We have no preconceptions on frontiers as such. What we believe to be important is that the frontiers be secure. For this the single most vital condition is that they be acceptable to both sides. It is a source of regret to us that the Arabs appear to misunderstand our proposal and misread our motives.&quot;

Furthermore, Secretary Rusk&#x27;s Telegram dated March 2, 1968, to the U.S. Interests Section of the Spanish Embassy in Cairo summarizing Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Eugene Rostow’s conversation with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin states:

In an address delivered on September 1, 1982, President Ronald Reagan said:

According to Michael Lynk, there are three schools of thought concerning the proper legal interpretation of the withdrawal phrase. Some of the parties involved have suggested that the indefinite language is a “perceptible loophole”, that authorizes “territorial revision” for Israel&#x27;s benefit. Some have stated that the indefinite language was used to permit insubstantial and mutually beneficial alterations to the 1949 armistices lines, but that unilateral annexation of the captured territory was never authorized. Other parties have said that no final settlement obtained through force or the threat of force could be considered valid. They insist that the Security Council cannot create loopholes in peremptory norms of international law or the UN Charter, and that any use of indefinite language has to be interpreted in line with the overriding legal principles regarding the “inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war” and the prohibitions on mass deportations or displacement in connection with the settlement of the refugee problem.

Alexander Orakhelashvili says that the Security Council manifestly lacks the competence to validate agreements imposed through coercion, not least because the peremptory prohibition of the use of force is a limitation on the Council&#x27;s powers and the voidness of coercively imposed treaties is the clear consequence of jus cogens and the conventional law as reflected in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. A recent South African study concluded that the ultimate status and boundaries will require negotiation between the parties, according to Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. The same study also found that the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention which govern ‘special agreements’ that can adversely affect the rights of protected persons precludes any change in status of the territory obtained through an agreement concluded during a state of belligerent occupation.

==Content==
===Preamble===
The second preambular reference states: 

Srijita Jha and Akshadha Mishra said that &quot;until 1945, annexation by conquest was a valid mode of acquisition of territory.&quot; Following World War I, Article 10 of the Covenant of the League of Nations limited (but did not eliminate) the concept of the right of conquest, that is, members of the League of Nations were not required to preserve &quot;the territorial integrity and existing political independence&quot; of a state engaging in a war of aggression. Since World War II, Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations requires all members to &quot;refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.&quot;

Michael Lynk says that article 2 of the Charter embodied a prevailing legal principle that there could be &quot;no title by conquest&quot;. He says that principle had been expressed through numerous international conferences, doctrines, and treaties since the late 19th Century. Lynk cites the examples of the First International Conference of American States in 1890; the United States Stimson Doctrine of 1932; the 1932 League of Nations resolution on Japanese aggression in China; the Buenos Aires Declaration of 1936; and the Atlantic Charter of 1941. Surya Sharma says that under the UN Charter, a war in self-defense cannot result in the acquisition of title by conquest. He says that even if a war is lawful in origin it cannot exceed the limits of legitimate self-defense.

===Land for peace===

The resolution also calls for the implementation of the &quot;land for peace&quot; formula, calling for Israeli withdrawal from &quot;territories&quot; it had occupied in 1967 in exchange for peace with its neighbors. This was an important advance at the time, considering that there were no peace treaties between any Arab state and Israel until the Egypt–Israel peace treaty of 1979. &quot;Land for peace&quot; served as the basis of the Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty, in which Israel withdrew from the Sinai peninsula (Egypt withdrew its claims to the Gaza Strip in favor of the Palestine Liberation Organization). Jordan renounced its claims regarding the West Bank in favor of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and has signed the Israel–Jordan peace treaty in 1994, that established the Jordan River as the boundary of Jordan.

Throughout the 1990s, there were Israeli-Syrian negotiations regarding a normalization of relations and an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. But a peace treaty was not made, mainly due to Syria&#x27;s desire to recover and retain 25 square kilometers of territory in the Jordan River Valley which it seized in 1948 and occupied until 1967. As the United Nations recognizes only the 1948 borders, there is little support for the Syrian position outside the Arab bloc nor in resolving the Golan Heights issue.

The UN resolution does not specifically mention the Palestinians. The United Kingdom had recognized the union between the West Bank and Transjordan. Lord Caradon said that the parties assumed that withdrawal from occupied territories as provided in the resolution was applicable to East Jerusalem. &quot;Nevertheless so important is the future of Jerusalem that it might be argued that we should have specifically dealt with that issue in the 1967 Resolution. It is easy to say that now, but I am quite sure that if we had attempted to raise or settle the question of Jerusalem as a separate issue at that time our task in attempting to find a unanimous decision would have been far greater if not impossible.&quot;

Judge Higgins of the International Court of Justice explained &quot;from Security Council resolution 242 (1967) through to Security Council Resolution 1515 (2003), the key underlying requirements have remained the same – that Israel is entitled to exist, to be recognized, and to security, and that the Palestinian people are entitled to their territory, to exercise self-determination, and to have their own State. Security Council resolution 1515 (2003)
envisages that these long-standing obligations are to be secured (...) by negotiation&quot;

The United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told the U.N. Security Council in 1994 that &quot;We simply do not support the description of the territories occupied by Israel in 1967 as &#x27;Occupied Palestinian Territory&#x27;. In the view of my Government, this language could be taken to indicate sovereignty, a matter which both Israel and the PLO have agreed must be decided in negotiations on the final status of the territories. Had this language appeared in the operative paragraphs of the resolution, let me be clear: we would have exercised our veto. In fact, we are today voting against a resolution in the Commission on the Status of Women precisely because it implies that Jerusalem is &#x27;occupied Palestinian territory&#x27;.&quot;

The Palestinians were represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization in negotiations leading to the Oslo Accords. They envisioned a &#x27;permanent settlement based on Security Council Resolution 242&#x27;. The main premise of the Oslo Accords was the eventual creation of Palestinian autonomy in some or all of the territories captured during the Six-Day War, in return for Palestinian recognition of Israel. However, the Foreign Minister of the Palestinian Authority, Nabil Shaath, said: &quot;Whether a state is announced now or after liberation, its borders must be those of 4 June 1967. We will not accept a state without borders or with borders based on UN Resolution 242, which we believe is no longer suitable. On the contrary, Resolution 242 has come to be used by Israel as a way to procrastinate.&quot;

The Security Council subsequently adopted resolution 1515 (2003), which recalled resolution 242 and endorsed the Middle East Quartet&#x27;s Road Map towards a permanent, two-State solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The Quartet Plan calls for direct, bilateral negotiations as part of a comprehensive resolution of the Arab–Israeli conflict, on the basis of UN Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, 1397, 1515, 1850, and the Madrid principles. The Quartet has reiterated that the only viable solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict is an agreement that ends the occupation that began in 1967; resolves all permanent status issues as previously defined by the parties; and fulfils the aspirations of both parties for independent homelands through two states for two peoples, Israel and an independent, contiguous and viable state of Palestine, living side by side in peace and security.

On April 14, 2004, US President George W. Bush said to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, &quot;The United States reiterates its steadfast commitment to Israel&#x27;s security, including secure, defensible borders.&quot; Israeli officials argue that the pre-1967 armistice line is not a defensible border, since Israel would be nine miles wide at the thinnest point, subjected to rocket fire from the highlands of the West Bank, and unable to stop smuggling from Jordan across the Jordan Valley. Thus, Israeli officials have been arguing for the final-status borders to be readjusted to reflect security concerns.

Resolution 1860 (2009) recalled resolution 242 and stressed that the Gaza Strip constitutes an integral part of the territory occupied in 1967 that will be a part of the Palestinian state.

===Settlement of the refugee problem===
The resolution advocates a &quot;just settlement of the refugee problem&quot;. Lord Caradon said &quot;It has been said that in the Resolution we treated Palestinians only as refugees, but this is unjustified. We provided that Israel should withdraw from occupied territories and it was together with that requirement for a restoration of Arab territory that we also called for a settlement of the refugee problem.&quot; Upon the adoption of Resolution 242, French President Charles de Gaulle stressed this principle during a press conference on November 27, 1967, and confirmed it in his letter of January 9, 1968, to David Ben-Gurion. De Gaulle cited &quot;the pitiful condition of the Arabs who had sought refuge in Jordan or were relegated to Gaza&quot; and stated that provided Israel withdrew her forces, it appeared it would be possible to reach a solution &quot;within the framework of the United Nations that included the assurance of a dignified and fair future for the refugees and minorities in the Middle East.&quot;

Alexander Orakhelashvili said that ‘Just settlement’ can only refer to a settlement guaranteeing
the return of displaced Palestinians. He explained that it must be presumed that the Council did not adopt decisions that validated mass deportation or displacement, since expulsion or deportation are crimes against humanity or an exceptionally serious war crime.

According to M. Avrum Ehrlich, &#x27;Resolution 242 called for &quot;a just solution to the refugee problem,&quot; a term covering Jewish refugees from Arab countries as stated by President Carter in 1978 at Camp David&#x27;.

According to John Quigley, however, it is clear from the context in which it was adopted, and from the statements recounted by the delegates, that Resolution 242 contemplates the Palestine Arab refugees only.

Arthur Goldberg, the United States ambassador to the U.N. at the time, wrote on the 20th anniversary that the &quot;language presumably refers both to Arab and Jewish refugees&quot;.

==French version vs. English version of text==
The English version of the clause:Withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflictis given in French as:

The difference between the two versions lies in the absence of a definite article (&quot;the&quot;) in the English version, while the word &quot;des&quot; present in the French version in the expression &quot;des territoires occupés&quot; can only mean &quot;from the occupied territories&quot; (the &quot;des&quot; in front of &quot;territoires occupés&quot; can only be the contraction &quot;from the&quot; because of the use of the word &quot;retrait&quot; which entails an object – &quot;des forces israéliennes&quot; where the &quot;des&quot; is the contraction of &quot;of the&quot; (of the Israeli forces) and a location &quot;des territoires occupés&quot; where &quot;des&quot; is the contraction of &quot;from the&quot; (from the occupied territories)). If the meaning of &quot;from some occupied territories&quot; were intended, the only way to say so in French would have been &quot;de territoires occupés&quot;.

Although some have dismissed the controversy by suggesting that the use of the word &quot;des&quot; in the French version is a translation error and should therefore be ignored in interpreting the document, the debate has retained its force since both versions are of equal legal force, as recognized languages of the United Nations and in international law.

Solicitor John McHugo, a partner at Trowers &amp; Hamlins and a visiting fellow at the Scottish Centre for International Law at Edinburgh University, draws a comparison to phrases such as:

In spite of the lack of definite articles, according to McHugo, it is clear that such an instruction cannot legitimately be taken to imply that some dogs need not be kept on the lead or that the rule applies only near some ponds. Further, McHugo points out a potential consequence of the logic employed by advocates of a &quot;some&quot; reading. Paragraph 2 (a) of the resolution, which guarantees &quot;freedom of navigation through international waterways in the area,&quot; may allow Arab states to interfere with navigation through &quot;some&quot; international waterways of their choosing.

Glenn Perry asserts that because the French version resolves ambiguities in the English text, and is more consistent with the other clauses of the treaty, it is the correct interpretation. He argues that &quot;it is an accepted rule that the various language versions must be considered together, with the ambiguities of one version elucidated by the other&quot;. He cites Article 33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which states that except when a treaty provides that one text shall prevail &quot;the meaning which best reconciles the texts, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty, shall be adopted&quot;. He furthermore argues that the context of the passage, in a treaty that reaffirms &quot;&#x27;territorial integrity&#x27;, &#x27;territorial inviolability,&#x27; and &#x27;the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war&#x27; – taken together cannot be reconciled with anything less than full withdrawal&quot;. He argues that the reference to &quot;secure and recognized borders&quot; can be interpreted in several ways, and only one of them contradicts the principle of full withdrawal.

Shabtai Rosenne, former Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations Office at Geneva and member of the UN&#x27;s International Law Commission, wrote that:

Only English and French were the Security Council&#x27;s working languages (Arabic, Russian, Spanish and Chinese were official but not the working languages).

The Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America argues the practice at the UN is that the binding version of any resolution is the one voted upon. In the case of 242 that version was in English, so they assert the English version the only binding one. David A. Korn asserts that this was indeed the position held by the United States and United Kingdom:

The French representative to the Security Council, in the debate immediately after the vote, asserted (in the official translation from French):

Opponents of the &quot;all territories&quot; reading remind that the UN Security Council declined to adopt a draft resolution, including the definite article, far prior to the adoption of Resolution 242. They argue that, in interpreting a resolution of an international organization, one must look to the process of the negotiation and adoption of the text. This would make the text in English, the language of the discussion, take precedence.

==The negotiating and drafting process==
A Congressional Research Service (CRS) Issue Brief quotes policy statements made by President Johnson in a speech delivered on September 10, 1968, and by Secretary of State Rogers in a speech delivered on December 9, 1969: &quot;The United States has stated that boundaries should be negotiated and mutually recognized, &#x27;should not reflect the weight of conquest,&#x27; and that adjustments in the pre-1967 boundaries should be &#x27;insubstantial.&#x27;&quot;

President Carter asked for a State Department report &quot;to determine if there was any justice to the Israeli position that the resolution did not include all the occupied territories&quot;. The State Department report concluded:Support for the concept of total withdrawal was widespread in the Security Council, and it was only through intensive American efforts that a resolution was adopted which employed indefinite language in the withdrawal clause. In the process of obtaining this result, the United States made clear to the Arab states and several other members of the Security Council that the United States envisioned only insubstantial revisions of the 1949 armistice lines. Israel did not protest the approach.
Ruth Lapidoth describes the view, adopted by Israel, which holds that the resolution allowed Israel to retain &quot;some territories&quot;. She argues &quot;The provision on the establishment of “secure and recognized boundaries” would have been meaningless if there had been an obligation to withdraw from all the territories.
U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger recalled the first time he heard someone invoke &quot;the sacramental language of United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, mumbling about the need for a just and lasting peace within secure and recognized borders&quot;. He said the phrase was so platitudinous that he thought the speaker was pulling his leg. Kissinger said that, at that time, he did not appreciate how the flood of words used to justify the various demands obscured rather than illuminated the fundamental positions. Kissinger said those &quot;clashing perspectives&quot; prevented any real bargaining and explained:
However, speaking to Henry Kissinger, President Richard Nixon said &quot;You and I both know they can’t go back to the other [1967] borders. But we must not, on the other hand, say that because the Israelis win this war, as they won the &#x27;67 War, that we just go on with status quo. It can&#x27;t be done.&quot; Kissinger replied &quot;I couldn&#x27;t agree more&quot;

Moreover, President Gerald Ford said: &quot;The U.S. further supports the position that a just and lasting peace, which remains our objective, must be acceptable to both sides. The U.S. has not developed a final position on the borders. Should it do so it will give great weight to Israel&#x27;s position that any peace agreement with Syria must be predicated on Israel remaining on the Golan Heights.&quot;

Furthermore, Secretary of State George Shultz declared: &quot;Israel will never negotiate from, or return to, the lines of partition or to the 1967 borders.&quot;
Secretary of State Christopher&#x27;s letter to Netanyahu states: &quot;I would like to reiterate our position that Israel is entitled to secure and defensible borders, which should be directly negotiated and agreed with its neighbors.&quot;

A key part of the case in favour of a &quot;some territories&quot; reading is the claim that British and American officials involved in the drafting of the resolution omitted the definite article deliberately in order to make it less demanding on the Israelis. As George Brown, British Foreign Secretary in 1967, said:

Lord Caradon, chief author of the resolution, takes a subtly different slant. His focus seems to be that the lack of a definite article is intended to deny permanence to the &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; pre-1967 border, rather than to allow Israel to retain land taken by force. Border rectification by mutual agreement is allowed:


Arthur J. Goldberg, another of the resolution&#x27;s drafters, argued that Resolution 242 does not dictate the extent of the withdrawal, and added that this matter should be negotiated between the parties:

Mr. Michael Stewart, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, in a reply to a question in Parliament, 9 December 1969: &quot;As I have explained before, there is reference, in the vital United Nations Security Council Resolution, both to withdrawal from territories and to secure and recognized boundaries. As I have told the House previously, we believe that these two things should be read concurrently and that the omission of the word &#x27;all&#x27; before the word &#x27;territories&#x27; is deliberate.&quot;

Mr. Joseph J. Sisco, Assistant Secretary of State, 12 July 1970 (NBC &quot;Meet the Press&quot;): &quot;That Resolution did not say &#x27;withdrawal to the pre-June 5 lines&#x27;. The Resolution said that the parties must negotiate to achieve agreement on the so-called final secure and recognized borders. In other words, the question of the final borders is a matter of negotiations between the parties.&quot; Mr. Sisco was actively involved in drafting the resolution in his capacity as Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs in 1967.

President Lyndon B. Johnson:

===U.S. position===
On June 19, 1967, President Johnson declared the five principles, including land for peace, that he believed comprised the components of any United Nations settlement of the Middle East crisis. He pledged the U.S. Government would &quot;do its part for peace in every forum, at every level, at every hour&quot;. On July 12, 1967, Secretary of State Rusk announced that the U.S. position on the Near East crisis was outlined in the President&#x27;s statement of June 19 and that it provided the basis for a just and equitable settlement between the Arab states and Israel. On August 16, 1967, the Israeli Foreign Office stated that Israel agreed with the principles set forth by the President on June 19 and indicated that no resolution would be acceptable if it deviated from them.

On June 9, 1967, Israeli Foreign Minister Eban assured Arthur Goldberg, US Ambassador to the UN, that Israel was not seeking territorial aggrandizement and had no &quot;colonial&quot; aspirations. Secretary of State Rusk stressed to the Government of Israel that no settlement with Jordan would be accepted by the world community unless it gave Jordan some special position in the Old City of Jerusalem. The US also assumed Jordan would receive the bulk of the West Bank as that was regarded as Jordanian territory.

On November 3, 1967, Ambassador Goldberg, accompanied by Mr. Sisco and Mr. Pedersen, called on King Hussein of Jordan. Goldberg said the US was committed to the principle of political independence and territorial integrity and was ready to reaffirm it bilaterally and publicly in the Security Council resolution. Goldberg said the US believes in territorial integrity, withdrawal, and recognition of secure boundaries. Goldberg said the principle of territorial integrity has two important sub-principles: there must be a withdrawal to recognized and secure frontiers for all countries, not necessarily the old armistice lines, and there must be mutuality in adjustments.

Walt Rostow advised President Johnson that Secretary Rusk had explained to Mr. Eban that US support for secure permanent frontiers does not mean the US supports territorial changes. The record of a meeting between Under Secretary of State Eugene Rostow and Israeli Ambassador Harmon stated that Rostow made clear the US view that there should be movement from General Armistice Agreements to conditions of peace and that this would involve some adjustments of armistice lines as foreseen in the Armistice Agreements. Rostow told Harmon that he had already stressed to Foreign Minister Eban that the US expected the thrust of the settlement would be toward security and demilitarization arrangements rather than toward major changes in the Armistice lines. Harmon said the Israeli position was that Jerusalem should be an open city under unified administration but that the Jordanian interest in Jerusalem could be met through arrangements including &quot;sovereignty&quot;. Rostow said the US government assumed (and Harman confirmed) that despite public statements to the contrary, the Government of Israel position on Jerusalem was that which Eban, Harman, and Evron had given several times, that Jerusalem was negotiable.

Ambassador Goldberg briefed King Hussein on US assurances regarding territorial integrity. Goldberg said the US did not view Jordan as a country that consisted only of the East Bank, and that the US was prepared to support a return of the West Bank to Jordan with minor boundary rectifications. The US would use its influence to obtain compensation to Jordan for any territory it would be required to give up. Finally, although as a matter of policy the US did not agree with Jordan&#x27;s position on Jerusalem, nor with the Israeli position on Jerusalem, the US was prepared to use its influence to obtain for Jordan a role in Jerusalem. Secretary Rusk advised President Johnson that he confirmed Goldberg&#x27;s pledge regarding territorial integrity to King Hussein.

During a subsequent meeting between President Johnson, King Hussein, and Secretary of State Rusk, Hussein said the phrasing of the resolution calling for withdrawal from occupied territories could be interpreted to mean that the Egyptians should withdraw from Gaza and the Jordanians should withdraw from the West Bank. He said this possibility was evident from a speech given by Prime Minister Eshkol in which it had been claimed that both Gaza and the West Bank had been &quot;occupied territory&quot;. The President agreed, and promised he would talk to Ambassador Goldberg about inserting Israel in that clause. Ambassador Goldberg told King Hussein that after taking into account legitimate Arab concerns and suggestions, the US would be willing to add the word &quot;Israeli&quot; before &quot;Armed Forces&quot; in the first operative paragraph.

A State Department study noted that when King Hussein met on 8 November with President Johnson, who had been briefed by Secretary Rusk on the US interpretation, the Jordanian monarch asked how soon the Israeli troops would withdraw from most of the occupied lands. The President replied &quot;In six months.&quot;

William Quandt wrote about Johnson&#x27;s meeting with Eban on October 24, 1967, and noted that Israel had annexed East Jerusalem. He said Johnson forcefully told Eban he thought Israel had been unwise when it went to war and that he still thought they were unwise. The President stressed the need to respect the territorial integrity of the Arab states. Quandt said &quot;&#x27;The President wished to caution the Israelis that the further they get from June 5 the further they get from peace.&#x27; Meaning the more territory they insisted on holding beyond the 1967 lines, the worse would be the odds of getting a peace agreement with the Arabs.&quot;

==Interpretations==
Israel interprets Resolution 242 as calling for withdrawal from territories as part of a negotiated peace and full diplomatic recognition. The extent of withdrawal would come as a result of comprehensive negotiations that led to durable peace not before Arabs start to meet their own obligations under Resolution 242.

Initially, the resolution was accepted by Egypt, Jordan and Israel but not by the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Arab position was initially that the resolution called for Israel to withdraw from all the territory it occupied during the Six-Day War prior to peace agreements.

Israel and the Arab states have negotiated before the Israeli withdrawal. Israel and Jordan made peace without Israel withdrawing from the West Bank, since Jordan had already renounced its claims and recognized the PLO as the sole representative of the Palestinians. Egypt began negotiations before Israel withdrew from the Sinai. Negotiations ended without Egypt ever resuming control of the Gaza Strip, which Egypt held until 1967.

Supporters of the &quot;Palestinian viewpoint&quot; focus on the phrase in the resolution&#x27;s preamble emphasizing the &quot;inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war&quot;, and note that the French version called for withdrawal from &quot;des territoires occupés&quot; – &quot;&quot;the&quot; territories occupied&quot;. The French UN delegation insisted on this interpretation at the time, but both English and French are the Secretariat&#x27;s working languages.

Supporters of the &quot;Israeli viewpoint&quot; note that the second part of that same sentence in the preamble explicitly recognizes the need of existing states to live in security.
They focus on the operative phrase calling for &quot;secure and recognized boundaries&quot; and note that the resolution calls for a withdrawal &quot;from territories&quot; rather than &quot;from the territories&quot; or &quot;from all territories,&quot; as the Arabs and others proposed; the latter two terms were rejected from the final draft of Resolution 242.

Alexander Orakhelashvili cites a number of cases in which international tribunals have ruled that international organizations, including the Security Council, are bound by general international law. He says that inclusion of explicit clauses about the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war and requiring respect of territorial integrity and sovereignty of a state demonstrates that the Council does not intend to offend peremptory norms in these specific ways. The resolution also acknowledges that these principles must be part of an accepted settlement. That is confirmed by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties which reiterates the prohibition on the use of force and provides that any settlement obtained by the threat or use of force in violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations or conflicting with a peremptory norm of general international law is invalid. According to Hans-Paul Gasser, ‘doubtful’ wording of the Council&#x27;s resolutions must always be construed in such a way as to avoid conflict with fundamental international obligations.

The USSR, India, Mali, Nigeria and Arab States all proposed that the resolution be changed to read &quot;all territories&quot; instead of &quot;territories.&quot; Their request was discussed by the UN Security Council and &quot;territories&quot; was adopted instead of &quot;all territories&quot;, after President Johnson told Premier Alexei Kosygin that the delegates should not try to negotiate the details of a Middle East settlement in the corridors and meeting halls of the United Nations, and Ambassador Goldberg stipulated that the exact wording of the resolution would not affect the position of any of the parties. Per Lord Caradon, the chief author of the resolution:

Lord Caradon also maintained,
During a symposium on the subject Lord Caradon said that Israel was in clear defiance of resolution 242. He specifically cited the &quot;annexation of East Jerusalem&quot; and &quot;the creeping colonialism on the West Bank and in Gaza and in the Golan.&quot;

However, British Foreign Secretary George Brown said:

===The PLO===

The day after Resolution 242 was adopted, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) rejected it as &quot;fundamentally and gravely inconsistent with the Arab character of Palestine, the essence of the Palestine cause and the right of the Palestinian people to their homeland.&quot; and &quot;disappoints the hopes of the Arab nation and ignores its national aspirations [... and] ignores the existence of the Palestinian people and their right of self-determination.&quot;

Replacing the National Charter of 1964 formulated by the first Palestine National Council (PNC), a revised National Charter was drawn up by the fourth PNC at Cairo in July 1968.

At the 12th PNC in Cairo on 8 June 1974, the PLO adopted the Ten-Point Program. Some hardline factions split away to form the Rejectionist Front. On the same day the PNC recommended to the PLO executive committee participation in the Geneva process. While reiterating its rejection of UN 242 the PLO should engage in a &quot;framework other than that of resolution 242.&quot; The Program, a compromise with rejectionists, marked the first official PLO document that suggested the feasibility of a two-state solution. While Israel was not likely to accept such conditions, the document suggested compromise. According to scholar Shaul Mishal, &quot;a real shift in the PLO position towards the occupied territories;unequivocal support for military struggle has ever since been supplemented by a willingness to consider political means as well.&quot; Although a minority, the creation of the Rejectionist Front enabled an argument that the PLO did not speak for all Palestinians and so should not participate at Geneva.

On 22 November 1974, United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3236 recognized the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, national independence and sovereignty in Palestine. It also recognized the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, and accorded it observer status in the United Nations. In 1975, as part of the Sinai II agreement, Kissinger had promised Israel that the United States would not deal with the PLO until it recognized Israel&#x27;s right to exist and accepted United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. The 1978 Camp David Accords attempted to address the Palestinian problem but there continued to be no direct Palestinian representation.

The 1988 Palestinian Declaration of Independence included a PNC call for multilateral negotiations on the basis of UN Security Council Resolution 242 later known as &quot;the Historic Compromise&quot;, implying acceptance of a two-state solution and no longer questioning the legitimacy of the State of Israel. The PNC called only for withdrawal from Arab Jerusalem and &quot;Arab territories occupied.&quot; Together with Yasser Arafat&#x27;s later statements in Geneva this was accepted by the United States as a basis for dialogue.
For the Madrid Conference of 1991 Israel still refused to deal directly with the PLO and the Palestinians formed part of a joint delegation with Jordan. Finally, in the 1993 Declaration of Principles and the subsequent Israeli-Palestinian agreements, Israel and the PLO each recognized the other and agreed terms of reference as Resolutions 242 and 338.

===Statements by Security Council representatives===

The representative for India stated to the Security Council:

The representatives from Nigeria, France, Soviet Union, Bulgaria, United Arab Republic (Egypt), Ethiopia, Jordan, Argentina and Mali supported this view, as worded by the representative from Mali: &quot;[Mali] wishes its vote today to be interpreted in the light of the clear and unequivocal interpretation which the representative of India gave of the provisions of the United Kingdom text.&quot; The Russian representative Vasili Kuznetsov stated:

Israel was the only country represented at the Security Council to express a contrary view. The United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Denmark, China and Japan were silent on the matter, but the US and UK did point out that other countries&#x27; comments on the meaning of 242 were simply their own views. The Syrian representative was strongly critical of the text&#x27;s &quot;vague call on Israel to withdraw&quot;.

The statement by the Brazilian representative perhaps gives a flavour of the complexities at the heart of the discussions:

However, the Soviet delegate Vasily Kuznetsov argued: &quot; ... phrases such as &#x27;secure and recognized boundaries&#x27;. ... make it possible for Israel itself arbitrarily to establish new boundaries and to withdraw its forces only to those lines it considers appropriate.&quot; [1373rd meeting, para. 152.]

U.S. Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg, who represented the US in discussions, later stated: &quot;The notable omissions in regard to withdrawal are the word &#x27;the&#x27; or &#x27;all&#x27; and &#x27;the June 5, 1967, lines&#x27; the resolution speaks of withdrawal from occupied territories, without defining the extent of withdrawal&quot;.

==Implementation==
On November 23, 1967, the Secretary General appointed Gunnar Jarring as Special Envoy to negotiate the implementation of the resolution with the parties, the so-called Jarring Mission. The governments of Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon recognized Jarring&#x27;s appointment and agreed to participate in his shuttle diplomacy, although they differed on key points of interpretation of the resolution. The government of Syria rejected Jarring&#x27;s mission on grounds that total Israeli withdrawal was a prerequisite for further negotiations. The talks under Jarring&#x27;s auspices lasted until 1973, but bore no results. After 1973, the Jarring mission was replaced by bilateral and multilateral peace conferences.

<text>Buffy the Vampire Slayer is an American supernatural drama television series created by writer and director Joss Whedon. The concept is based on the 1992 film, also written by Whedon, although they are separate and unrelated productions. Whedon served as executive producer and showrunner of the series under his production tag Mutant Enemy Productions. It premiered on March 10, 1997, on The WB and concluded on May 20, 2003, on UPN.

The series follows Buffy Summers (played by Sarah Michelle Gellar), the latest in a succession of young women known as &quot;Vampire Slayers&quot;. Slayers are chosen by fate to battle against vampires, demons and other forces of darkness. Buffy wants to live a normal life, but learns to embrace her destiny as the series progresses. Like previous Slayers, she is aided by a Watcher, who guides, teaches and trains her. Unlike her predecessors, Buffy surrounds herself with loyal friends who become known as the &quot;Scoobies&quot;. The show primarily takes place in the fictional setting of Sunnydale, a small Southern California city located on a &quot;Hellmouth&quot;; a portal &quot;between this reality and the next&quot;, and a convergence point of mystical energies. Because of this, supernatural creatures and beings with magical powers, both good and evil, are drawn to Sunnydale or rise from below ground to menace the town and the world.

The series received critical and popular acclaim, and is often listed among the greatest television series of all time. Original airings often reached four to six million viewers. Although lower than successful shows on the &quot;big four&quot; networks (ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox), these ratings were a success for the relatively new and smaller WB Television Network. Despite being mostly ignored in above-the-line categories by the Emmys, the series was nominated for the American Film Institute Award for Drama Series of the Year, Gellar was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama for her performance in the show and the series was nominated five times for Television Critics Association Awards, winning in 2003 for the Television Critics Association Heritage Award.

The success of &quot;Buffy&quot; has led to hundreds of tie-in products, including novels, comics and video games. The series has received attention in fandom (including fan films), parody, and academia, and has influenced the direction of other television series. &quot;Buffy&quot; was part of a wave of television series from the late 1990s and early 2000s that featured strong female characters, alongside &quot;Charmed&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot;, &quot;Dark Angel&quot;, and &quot;Alias&quot;. The series, as well as its spin-off series, &quot;Angel&quot;, and extensions thereof, have been collectively termed the &quot;Buffyverse&quot;.

==Premise==

===Characters===
Buffy Summers (played by Sarah Michelle Gellar) is the &quot;Slayer&quot;, one in a long line of young women chosen by fate to battle evil forces. This mystical calling grants her powers that dramatically increase physical strength, endurance, agility, accelerated healing, intuition, and a limited degree of precognition, usually in the form of prophetic dreams. She is known as a reluctant hero who wants to live a normal life. However, she learns to embrace her destiny as the vampire slayer.

Buffy receives guidance from her Watcher, Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head). Giles, rarely referred to by his first name (it is later revealed that in his rebellious younger days he went by &quot;Ripper&quot;), is a member of the Watchers&#x27; Council, whose job is to train and guide the Slayers. Giles researches the supernatural creatures that Buffy must face, offers insights into their origins, advice on how to defeat them, and helps her train to stay in fighting form.

Buffy also receives help from the friends she meets at Sunnydale High School: Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan) and Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon). Willow is originally a wallflower who excels at academics, providing a contrast to Buffy&#x27;s outgoing personality and less-than-stellar educational record. They share the social isolation that comes with being different, and especially from being exceptional young women. As the series progresses, Willow becomes a more assertive character and a powerful witch, and realizes she is a lesbian. In contrast, Xander, with no supernatural abilities, provides comic relief and a grounded perspective. Buffy and Willow are the only characters who appear in all 144 episodes, with Xander appearing in 143.

The cast of characters grew over the course of the series. Buffy first arrives in Sunnydale with her mother, Joyce Summers (Kristine Sutherland), who functions as an anchor of normality in the Summers&#x27; lives even after she learns of Buffy&#x27;s role in the supernatural world (&quot;Becoming, Part Two&quot;). Buffy&#x27;s younger sister Dawn Summers (Michelle Trachtenberg) is introduced in season five (&quot;Buffy vs. Dracula&quot;). Angel (David Boreanaz), a vampire cursed with a soul, is Buffy&#x27;s love interest throughout the first three seasons. He leaves Buffy after realizing he will never be able to give her a normal life. He goes on to make amends for his sins and to search for redemption in his own spin-off television series, &quot;Angel&quot;. He makes several guest appearances in the remaining seasons, and is present in &quot;Buffy&quot;″s final episode.

At Sunnydale High, Buffy meets several other students besides Willow and Xander willing to join her fight for good, an informal group eventually tagged the &quot;Scooby Gang&quot; or &quot;Scoobies&quot;. Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), the archetypal shallow cheerleader, reluctantly becomes involved. Daniel &quot;Oz&quot; Osbourne (Seth Green), a fellow student, rock guitarist and werewolf, joins the group through his relationship with Willow. Jenny Calendar (Robia LaMorte), Sunnydale&#x27;s computer science teacher, joins the group after helping destroy a demon trapped in cyberspace during season 1; she later becomes Giles&#x27; love interest. Anya (Emma Caulfield) is a former vengeance demon called Anyanka who specialized in avenging scorned women; after losing her powers she became Xander&#x27;s lover, then joined the Scoobies in season four.

In Buffy&#x27;s senior year at high school, she meets Faith (Eliza Dushku), another Slayer called forth when Slayer Kendra Young (Bianca Lawson) was killed by vampire Drusilla (Juliet Landau) in season two. Although Faith initially fights on the side of good with Buffy and the rest of the group, she later joins forces with Mayor Richard Wilkins (Harry Groener) after accidentally killing a human. She reappears briefly in the fourth season, looking for vengeance, and moves to &quot;Angel&quot; where she voluntarily goes to jail for her crimes. Faith reappears in season seven of &quot;Buffy&quot;, after having helped Angel and his crew, and fights alongside Buffy against the First Evil.

Buffy gathers other allies throughout the series: Spike (James Marsters), a vampire, is an old companion of Angelus (Angel) and one of Buffy&#x27;s major enemies in early seasons, although he and Buffy later become allies and lovers. At the end of season six, Spike regains his soul. Spike is known for his Billy Idol-style peroxide blond hair and his black leather coat, stolen from a previous Slayer, Nikki Wood. Nikki&#x27;s son, Robin Wood (D. B. Woodside), joins the group in the final season. Tara Maclay (Amber Benson) is a fellow member of Willow&#x27;s Wicca group during season four, and their friendship evolves into a romantic relationship. Buffy becomes involved personally and professionally with Riley Finn (Marc Blucas), a military operative in &quot;the Initiative&quot;, which hunts demons using science and technology. The seventh and final season sees geeky wannabe-villain Andrew Wells (Tom Lenk) side with the Scoobies after initially being their captive/hostage; they regard him more as a nuisance than an ally.

&quot;Buffy&quot; featured dozens of major and minor recurring characters. For example, the &quot;Big Bad&quot; (villain) characters were featured for at least one season (for example, Glory is a character who appeared in 12 episodes, spanning much of season five). Similarly, characters who allied themselves to the group and characters who attended the same institutions were sometimes featured in multiple episodes.

===Setting and filming locations===

The show is set in the fictional California town of Sunnydale, whose suburban Sunnydale High School sits on top of a &quot;Hellmouth&quot;, a gateway to demon realms. The Hellmouth, located beneath the school library, is a source of mystical energies as well as a for a wide variety of evil creatures and supernatural phenomena. Joss Whedon cited the Hellmouth and &quot;high school as hell&quot; as one of the primary metaphors in creating the series.

Most of &quot;Buffy&quot; was shot on location in Los Angeles, California. The high school used in the first three seasons is actually Torrance High School, in Torrance, California, the same high school used for &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;. The show was initially very dependent on location shooting, because the production budget allowed for few permanent sets to be built. In the first season this was limited to the interior of Sunnydale High (the library, hallways, and classrooms), Buffy&#x27;s bedroom, and the Master&#x27;s underground lair. Starting in the second season, more permanent sets were built, including the full interior of Buffy&#x27;s house, Angel&#x27;s mansion, and Giles&#x27;s apartment, as well as extensions to the high school set (the addition of a dining hall and commons area). A driveway area near the gated entrance to Fox Studios was transformed into a graveyard. In the third season the Sunnydale &quot;Main Street&quot; was constructed on the backlot, which would be a staple location for the rest of the series. When the show transitioned to college in the fourth season, the hallway sets from Sunnydale High were remodeled to appear as the interior hallways of UC Sunnydale.

Some of the exterior shots of the college Buffy attends, UC Sunnydale, were filmed at UCLA. Several episodes include shots from the Oviatt Library at CSUN. The exterior of the Crawford Street mansion where Angelus, Spike, and Drusilla lived was Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s Ennis House.

===Format===
&quot;Buffy&quot; is told in a serialized format, mixing complex, season-long storylines with a villain-of-the-week conflict revolving around Buffy and her friends as they struggle to balance the fight against supernatural evils with their complicated social lives. A typical episode contains one or more villains, or supernatural phenomena, that are thwarted or defeated by the end of the episode. Though elements and relationships are explored and ongoing subplots are included, the show focuses primarily on Buffy and her role as an archetypal heroine. Gellar described the show as &quot;the ultimate metaphor: horrors of adolescence manifesting through these actual monsters. It&#x27;s the hardest time of life.&quot; Each season&#x27;s storyline is broken down into season-long narratives marked by the rise and defeat of a powerful antagonist, commonly referred to as the &quot;Big Bad&quot;.

While the show is mainly a drama with frequent comic relief, most episodes blend different genres, including horror, martial arts, romance, melodrama, farce, fantasy, supernatural, comedy, and, in one episode, musical comedy.

In the first few seasons, the most prominent monsters in the &quot;Buffy&quot; bestiary are vampires based on traditional myths, lore, and literary conventions. As the series continues, Buffy and her companions fight an increasing variety of demons, as well as ghosts, werewolves, zombies, and unscrupulous humans. They frequently save the world from annihilation by a combination of physical combat, magic, and detective-style investigation, and are guided by an extensive collection of ancient and mystical reference books. 

==Episodes==

===Plot summary===

Season one exemplifies the &quot;high school is hell&quot; concept. Buffy Summers has just moved to Sunnydale after burning down her old school&#x27;s gym and hopes to escape her Slayer duties. Her plans are complicated by Rupert Giles, her new Watcher, who reminds her of the inescapable presence of evil. Sunnydale High is built atop a Hellmouth, a portal to demon dimensions that attracts supernatural phenomena to the area. A mysterious man, Angel, warns Buffy of upcoming danger. She eventually discovers that he is a vampire cursed with a soul, which prevents him from feeding off living humans. Buffy befriends two schoolmates, Xander Harris and Willow Rosenberg, who help her fight evil throughout the series. Buffy, her Watcher and friends later start to collectively call themselves the &quot;Scooby Gang&quot;. Their first major threat is the Master, an ancient and especially threatening vampire, who was trapped in the hellmouth underground. When he escapes, Buffy defeats him and saves Sunnydale.

The emotional stakes are raised in season two. Vampire couple Spike and Drusilla come to town. A new slayer, Kendra, who is activated as a result of Buffy&#x27;s brief death in season one, also arrives in Sunnydale. Popular schoolmate, Cordelia Chase, who resented Buffy and her friends, joins the Scooby Gang and becomes involved with Xander. Willow learns witchcraft and becomes involved with schoolmate Daniel &quot;Oz&quot; Osbourne, who is a werewolf. The romantic relationship between Buffy and the vampire Angel develops. But after they have sex, Angel experiences a moment of true happiness, breaking the curse that gave him his soul, thus reverting him to a sadistic killer. The evil vampire, famously known as Angelus, joins the other vampires Spike and Drusilla, and he torments Buffy and her friends. He murders multiple innocents and Giles&#x27;s new girlfriend Jenny Calendar, a Romani woman who was sent to maintain Angel&#x27;s curse. Kendra is murdered by Drusilla. To avert an apocalypse, Buffy is forced to banish Angel to a hell dimension just moments after Willow has restored his soul. The ordeal leaves Buffy emotionally shattered, and she leaves Sunnydale.

After attempting to start a new life in Los Angeles, Buffy returns to town in season three. Angel has been mysteriously released from the demon dimension but is close to insanity due to the torment he suffered there. He recovers, but he and Buffy realize that a relationship between them can never happen and Angel leaves Sunnydale at the end of the season. Giles is fired from the Watchers&#x27; Council because he has developed a &quot;father&#x27;s love&quot; for Buffy and he is replaced by Wesley Wyndam-Pryce. Towards the end of the season, Buffy announces that she will no longer be working for the council. Early in the season, she meets Faith, the Slayer activated after Kendra&#x27;s death. She also encounters the affable Mayor Richard Wilkins III, who secretly has plans to &quot;ascend&quot; (become a &quot;pure&quot; demon) on Sunnydale High&#x27;s graduation day. Although Faith initially works well with Buffy, she becomes increasingly unstable after accidentally killing a human and forms a relationship with the paternal yet manipulative mayor. The rivalry between Buffy and Faith eventually lands Faith in a coma. At the end of the season, after the mayor becomes a huge snake-like demon, Buffy, Angel, the Scooby Gang and the entire graduating class destroy him by blowing up Sunnydale High. At the end of the season, Angel and Cordelia leave the series to star in the spin-off series, &quot;Angel&quot;.

Season four sees Buffy and Willow enroll at UC Sunnydale, while Xander joins the workforce and begins dating Anya, a former vengeance demon. Spike returns as a series regular and is abducted by The Initiative, a top-secret military installation based beneath the UC Sunnydale campus. They implant a microchip in his head that prevents him from harming humans. Every time he tries to harm a human, he suffers excruciating pain. Upon learning that he can still harm other demons, he joins in with the Scooby Gang, purely for the joy of fighting. Oz leaves town after realizing that he is too dangerous as a werewolf, and Willow falls in love with Tara Maclay, another witch. Faith awakens from her coma and escapes from Sunnydale to L.A. Buffy begins dating Riley Finn, a graduate student and US Army Ranger seconded to The Initiative. Although appearing to be a well-meaning anti-demon operation, The Initiative&#x27;s sinister plans are revealed when Adam, a monster secretly built from parts of humans, demons and machinery, escapes and begins to wreak havoc on the town. Adam is destroyed by a magical composite of Buffy and her three friends, and The Initiative is shut down.

During season five, a younger sister, Dawn, suddenly appears in Buffy&#x27;s life; although she is new to the series, to the characters it is as if she has always been there. Buffy is confronted by Glory, an exiled Hell God who is searching for a &quot;Key&quot; that will allow her to return to her Hell dimension and in the process blur the lines between dimensions and unleash Hell on Earth. It is later discovered that the Key&#x27;s protectors have used Buffy&#x27;s blood to turn the Key into human form–Dawn–concurrently implanting everybody with lifelong memories of her. The Watchers&#x27; Council aids in Buffy&#x27;s research on Glory, and she and Giles are both reinstated on their own terms. Riley leaves early in the season after realizing that Buffy does not love him and joins a military demon-hunting operation. Spike, still implanted with his chip from The Initiative, realizes he is in love with Buffy and increasingly helps the Scoobies in their fight. Buffy&#x27;s mother Joyce dies of a brain aneurysm, while at the end of the season, Xander proposes to Anya. Glory finally discovers that Dawn is the key and kidnaps her, using Dawn&#x27;s blood to open a portal to the Hell dimension. To save Dawn, Buffy sacrifices her own life by diving into the portal, thus closing it with her death.

At the beginning of season six, Buffy has been dead for 147 days, but Buffy&#x27;s friends resurrect her through a powerful spell, believing they have rescued her from a Hell dimension. Buffy returns in a deep depression, explaining (several episodes later) that she had been in heaven and is devastated to be pulled back to earth. Giles returns to England because he has concluded that Buffy has become too reliant on him, while Buffy takes up a fast-food job to support herself and Dawn and develops a secret, mutually abusive sexual relationship with Spike. Dawn suffers from kleptomania and feelings of alienation, Xander leaves Anya at the altar (after which she once again becomes a vengeance demon), and Willow becomes addicted to magic, causing Tara to temporarily leave her. They also begin to deal with the Trio, a group of nerds led by Warren Mears who use their proficiency in technology and magic to attempt to kill Buffy and take over Sunnydale. Warren is shown to be the only competent villain of the group and, after Buffy thwarts his plans multiple times, the Trio breaks apart. Warren becomes unhinged and attacks Buffy with a gun, accidentally killing Tara in the process. This causes Willow to descend into nihilistic darkness and unleash all of her dark magical powers, killing Warren and attempting to kill his friends. Giles returns to face her in battle and infuses her with light magic, tapping into her remaining humanity. This overwhelms Willow with guilt and pain, whereupon she attempts to destroy the world to end everyone&#x27;s suffering, although it eventually allows Xander to reach through her pain and end her rampage. Late in the season, after losing control and trying to rape Buffy, Spike leaves Sunnydale and travels to see a demon and asks him to &quot;return him to what he used to be&quot; so that he can &quot;give Buffy what she deserves&quot;. After Spike passes a series of brutal tests, the demon restores his soul.

During season seven, it is revealed that Buffy&#x27;s second resurrection caused instability in the slayer line which also allowed the First Evil to begin tipping the balance between good and evil. It begins by hunting down and killing inactive Potential Slayers and soon raises an army of ancient, powerful Turok-Han vampires. After the Watchers&#x27; Council is destroyed, a number of Potential Slayers (some brought by Giles) take refuge in Buffy&#x27;s house. Faith returns to help fight the First Evil, and the new Sunnydale High School principal, Robin Wood, also joins the cause. The Turok-Han vampires and a sinister, misogynistic preacher known as Caleb begin causing havoc for the Scoobies. As the Hellmouth becomes more active, nearly all of Sunnydale&#x27;s population–humans and demons alike–flee. In the series finale, Buffy kills Caleb and Angel returns to Sunnydale with an amulet, which Buffy gives to Spike; the Scoobies then surround the Hellmouth, and the Potential Slayers descend into its cavern while Willow casts a spell that activates their Slayer powers. Anya dies in the fight, as do some of the new Slayers. Spike&#x27;s amulet channels the power of the sun to destroy the Hellmouth and all the vampires within it, including himself. The collapse of the cavern creates a crater that swallows all of Sunnydale, while the survivors of the battle escape in a school bus. In the final scene, as the survivors survey the crater, Dawn asks, &quot;What are we going to do now?&quot; Buffy slowly begins to enigmatically smile as she contemplates the future ahead of her, ending the series on a hopeful note.

==Production==

===Origins===

Writer Joss Whedon says that &quot;Rhonda the Immortal Waitress&quot; was really the first incarnation of the &quot;Buffy&quot; concept, &quot;the idea of some woman who seems to be completely insignificant who turns out to be extraordinary&quot;. This early, unproduced idea evolved into &quot;Buffy&quot;, which Whedon developed to invert the Hollywood formula of &quot;the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror movie&quot;. Whedon wanted &quot;to subvert that idea and create someone who was a hero&quot;. He explained, &quot;The very first mission statement of the show was the joy of female power: having it, using it, sharing it.&quot;

The idea was first visited through Whedon&#x27;s script for the 1992 movie &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, which featured Kristy Swanson in the title role. The director, Fran Rubel Kuzui, saw it as a &quot;pop culture comedy about what people think about vampires&quot;. Whedon disagreed: &quot;I had written this scary film about an empowered woman, and they turned it into a broad comedy. It was crushing.&quot; The script was praised within the industry, but the movie was not.

Several years later, Gail Berman (later a Fox executive, but at that time President and CEO of the production company Sandollar Television, who owned the TV rights to the movie) approached Whedon to develop his &quot;Buffy&quot; concept into a television series. Whedon explained that &quot;They said, &#x27;Do you want to do a show?&#x27; And I thought, &#x27;High school as a horror movie.&#x27; And so the metaphor became the central concept behind &quot;Buffy&quot;, and that&#x27;s how I sold it.&quot; The supernatural elements in the series stood as metaphors for personal anxieties associated with adolescence and young adulthood. Early in its development, the series was going to be simply titled &quot;Slayer&quot;. Whedon went on to write and partly fund a 25-minute non-broadcast pilot that was shown to networks and eventually sold to the WB Network. The latter promoted the premiere with a series of &quot;History of the Slayer&quot; clips, and the first episode aired on March 10, 1997. Whedon has declared in June 2003 that the non-broadcast pilot would not be included with DVDs of the series &quot;while there is strength in these bones&quot;, stating that it &quot;sucks on ass&quot;. Dolly Parton was an uncredited producer of the series.

===Executive producers===
Joss Whedon was credited as executive producer throughout the run of the series, and for the first five seasons (1997–2001) he was also the showrunner, supervising the writing and all aspects of production. Marti Noxon took on the role for seasons six and seven (2001–2003), but Whedon continued to be involved with writing and directing &quot;Buffy&quot; alongside projects such as &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Fray&quot;, and &quot;Firefly&quot;. Fran Rubel Kuzui and her husband, Kaz Kuzui, were credited as executive producers but were not involved in the show. Their credit, rights, and royalties over the franchise relate to their funding, producing, and directing of the original movie version of &quot;Buffy&quot;.

===Writing===
Script-writing was done by Mutant Enemy, a production company created by Whedon in 1997. The writers with the most writing credits are Joss Whedon, Steven S. DeKnight, Jane Espenson, David Fury, Drew Goddard, Drew Greenberg, David Greenwalt, Rebecca Rand Kirshner, Marti Noxon and Doug Petrie. Other authors with writing credits include Dean Batali, Carl Ellsworth, Tracey Forbes, Ashley Gable, Howard Gordon, Diego Gutierrez, Elin Hampton, Rob Des Hotel, Matt Kiene, Ty King, Thomas A. Swyden, Joe Reinkemeyer, Dana Reston and Dan Vebber.

Jane Espenson has explained how scripts came together. First, the writers talked about the emotional issues facing Buffy Summers and how she would confront them through her battle against evil supernatural forces. Then the episode&#x27;s story was broken into acts and scenes. Act breaks were designed as key moments to intrigue viewers so that they would stay with the episode following the commercial break. The writers collectively filled in scenes surrounding these act breaks for a more fleshed-out story. A whiteboard marked their progress by mapping brief descriptions of each scene. Once breaking was complete, the credited author wrote an outline for the episode, which was checked by Whedon or Noxon. The writer then wrote a full script, which went through a series of drafts, and finally a quick rewrite from the showrunner. The final article was used as the shooting script.

===Music===
&quot;Buffy&quot; features a mix of original, indie, rock, and pop music. The composers spent around seven days scoring between fourteen and thirty minutes of music for each episode. Christophe Beck revealed that the &quot;Buffy&quot; composers used computers and synthesizers and were limited to recording one or two &quot;real&quot; samples. Despite this, their goal was to produce &quot;dramatic&quot; orchestration that would stand up to film scores.

Alongside the score, most episodes featured indie rock music, usually at the characters&#x27; venue of choice, The Bronze. &quot;Buffy&quot; music supervisor John King explained that &quot;we like to use unsigned bands&quot; that &quot;you would believe would play in this place&quot;. For example, the fictional group Dingoes Ate My Baby were portrayed on screen by front group Four Star Mary. Pop songs by famous artists were rarely featured prominently, but several episodes spotlighted the sounds of more famous artists such as Sarah McLachlan, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, Blink-182, Third Eye Blind, Aimee Mann (who also had a line of dialogue), The Dandy Warhols, Cibo Matto, Coldplay, Lisa Loeb, K&#x27;s Choice, and Michelle Branch. The popularity of music used in &quot;Buffy&quot; has led to the release of four soundtrack albums: &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Album&quot;, &quot;Radio Sunnydale&quot;, the &quot;&quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot; Soundtrack&quot;, and &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Score&quot;.

=== Special effects ===
&quot;Buffy&quot; features a variety of monsters and supernatural creatures. Monster suits were created by John Vulich and his special effects company Optic Nerve, while blending and beauty makeup was created by makeup supervisor Todd McIntosh. McIntosh is credited with creating the iconic vampire face &quot;Buffy&quot; is known for, inspired by McIntosh&#x27;s love for shows like the Gothic soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;.

===Inspirations and metaphors===
During the first year of the series, Whedon described the show as &quot;&quot;My So-Called Life&quot; with &quot;The X-Files&quot;&quot;. Alongside these series, Whedon has cited cult film &quot;Night of the Comet&quot; as a &quot;big influence&quot;, and credited the &quot;X-Men&quot; character Kitty Pryde as a significant influence on the character of Buffy. The authors of the unofficial guidebook &quot;Dusted&quot; point out that the series was often a pastiche, borrowing elements from previous horror novels, movies, and short stories and from such common literary stock as folklore and mythology. Nevitt and Smith describe &quot;Buffy&quot;&#x27;s use of pastiche as &quot;postmodern Gothic&quot;. For example, the Adam character parallels the &quot;Frankenstein&quot; monster, the episode &quot;Bad Eggs&quot; parallels &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot;, &quot;Out of Mind, Out of Sight&quot; parallels &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;, and so on.

&quot;Buffy&quot; episodes frequently include a deeper meaning or metaphor. Whedon explained, &quot;We think very carefully about what we&#x27;re trying to say emotionally, politically, and even philosophically while we&#x27;re writing it... it really is, apart from being a pop-culture phenomenon, something that is deeply layered textually episode by episode.&quot; Academics Wilcox and Lavery provide examples of episodes dealing with real life issues portrayed as supernatural metaphors:

The love affair between the vampire Angel and Buffy was fraught with metaphors. For example, their night of passion cost the vampire his soul. Sarah Michelle Gellar said: &quot;That&#x27;s the ultimate metaphor. You sleep with a guy and he turns bad on you&quot;. Marsters said that his character was part of an audience-and network-forced change for the show; themes about overcoming adolescent problems gave way to &quot;problems that are kind of sexy&quot;, frustrating Whedon.

Buffy struggles throughout the series with her calling as Slayer and the loss of freedom this entails, frequently sacrificing teenage experiences for her Slayer duties. Her difficulties and eventual empowering realizations are reflections of several dichotomies faced by modern women and echo feminist issues within society.

In the episode &quot;Becoming (Part 2)&quot;, when Joyce learns that Buffy is the Slayer, her reaction has strong echoes of a parent discovering her child is gay, including denial, suggesting that she tries &quot;not being a Slayer&quot;, before ultimately kicking Buffy out of the house.

===Casting===
Katie Holmes and Selma Blair were in the running for the role of Buffy in 1996. Natasha Lyonne was also offered the role but declined it due to not wanting to commit to a series at the age of 16. Other actresses who originally auditioned for the role of Buffy and got other roles in the show include Julie Benz (Darla), Elizabeth Anne Allen (Amy Madison), Julia Lee (Chantarelle/Lily Houston), Charisma Carpenter (Cordelia Chase) and Mercedes McNab (Harmony Kendall). Bianca Lawson, who played slayer Kendra Young in season 2 of the show, originally auditioned for the role of Cordelia before Carpenter was cast in the role.

The title role went to Sarah Michelle Gellar, who had appeared as Sydney Rutledge on &quot;Swans Crossing&quot; and Kendall Hart on &quot;All My Children&quot;. At age 18 in 1995, Gellar had already won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Leading Actress in a Drama Series. In 1996, she originally auditioned for the role of Cordelia. After watching her audition, Whedon asked her to come back in and audition for the lead role of Buffy.

A talent agent spotted David Boreanaz on the sidewalk walking his dog. He immediately contacted casting director Marcia Shulman, saying that he had found Angel.

Anthony Stewart Head had already led a prolific acting and singing career but remained best known in the United States for a series of twelve coffee commercials with Sharon Maughan for Taster&#x27;s Choice instant coffee. He accepted the role of Rupert Giles.

Nicholas Brendon, unlike other &quot;Buffy&quot; regulars, had little acting experience, instead working various jobs—including production assistant, plumber&#x27;s assistant, veterinary janitor, food delivery, script delivery, day care counselor, and waiter—before breaking into acting and overcoming his stutter. He landed the role of Xander Harris following four days of auditioning. Ryan Reynolds and Danny Strong also auditioned for the part. Strong later played the role of Jonathan Levinson, a recurring character for much of the series run.

Alyson Hannigan was the last of the original six to be cast. Following her role in &quot;My Stepmother Is an Alien&quot;, she appeared in commercials and supporting roles on television shows throughout the early 1990s. In 1996, the role of Willow Rosenberg was originally played by Riff Regan for the unaired &quot;Buffy&quot; pilot, but Hannigan auditioned when the role was being recast for the series proper. Hannigan described her approach to the character through Willow&#x27;s reaction to a particular moment: Willow sadly tells Buffy that her Barbie doll was taken from her as a child. Buffy asks her if she ever got it back. Willow&#x27;s line was to reply &quot;most of it&quot;. Hannigan decided on an upbeat and happy delivery of the line &quot;most of it&quot;, as opposed to a sad, depressed delivery. Hannigan figured Willow would be happy and proud that she got &quot;most of it&quot; back. That indicated how she was going to play the rest of the scene, and the role, for that matter, and defined the character. Her approach subsequently got her the role.

===Opening sequence===
The &quot;Buffy&quot; opening sequence provides credits at the beginning of each episode, with the accompanying music performed by Californian rock band Nerf Herder. In the DVD commentary for the first &quot;Buffy&quot; episode, Whedon said his decision to go with Nerf Herder&#x27;s theme was influenced by Hannigan, who had urged him to listen to the band&#x27;s music. Nerf Herder later recorded a second version of the theme which was used for the opening titles from season 3 on. Janet Halfyard, in her essay &quot;Music, Gender, and Identity in &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;&quot;, describes the opening:

But the theme quickly changes: &quot;It removes itself from the sphere of 1960s and 70s horror by replaying the same motif, the organ now supplanted by an aggressively strummed electric guitar, relocating itself in modern youth culture ...&quot; Halfyard describes sequences, in which the action and turbulence of adolescence are depicted, as the visual content of the opening credits, and which provide a postmodern twist on the horror genre.

==Broadcast history and syndication==

&quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; first aired on March 10, 1997 (as a mid-season replacement for the series &quot;Savannah&quot;) on The WB, and played a key role in the growth of the Warner Bros. television network in its early years. After five seasons, it transferred to UPN for its final two seasons. In 2001, the show went into syndication in the United States on local stations and on cable channel FX; the local airings ended in 2005, and the FX airings lasted until 2008 but returned to the network in 2013. Beginning in January 2010, it began to air in syndication in the United States on Logo. Reruns also briefly aired on MTV. In March 2010, it began to air in Canada on MuchMusic and MuchMore. On November 7, 2010, it began airing on Chiller with a 24-hour marathon; the series airs weekdays. Chiller also aired a 14-hour Thanksgiving Day marathon on November 25, 2010. In 2011, it began airing on Oxygen and TeenNick. On June 22, 2015, it began airing on ABC Family.

While the seventh season was still being broadcast, Sarah Michelle Gellar told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; she was not going to sign on for an eighth year; &quot;When we started to have such a strong year this year, I thought: &#x27;This is how I want to go out, on top, at our best.&#x27;&quot; Whedon and UPN gave some considerations to production of a spin-off series that would not require Gellar, including a rumored Faith series, but nothing came of those plans. The &quot;Buffy&quot; canon continued outside the television medium in the Dark Horse Comics series, &quot;Buffy&quot; Season Eight. This was produced starting March 2007 by Whedon, who also wrote the first story arc, &quot;The Long Way Home&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, the entire series aired on Sky One and BBC Two. After protests from fans about early episodes being edited for their pre-watershed time-slot, from the second run (mid-second season onwards), the BBC gave the show two time slots: the early-evening slot (typically Thursday at 6:45 pm) for a family-friendly version with violence, objectionable language and other stronger material cut out, and a late-night uncut version (initially late-night Sundays, but for most of the run, late-night Fridays; exact times varied). Sky1 aired the show typically at 8:00 pm on Thursdays. From the fourth season onwards, the BBC aired the show in anamorphic 16:9 widescreen format. Whedon later said that &quot;Buffy&quot; was never intended to be viewed this way. Despite his claims, Syfy now airs repeat showings in the widescreen format.

In August 2014, Pivot announced that, for the first time, episodes of &quot;Buffy&quot; would be broadcast in high-definition and in a widescreen 16:9 format authorized by the studio, but not by any of the series&#x27; principals. The transfer was poorly received by some fans, owing to a number of technical and format changes that were viewed as detrimental to the show&#x27;s presentation; various scenes were heavily cropped to fit the 16:9 format, and shots were altered to have a brighter look, often with color levels altered. Other problems included missing filters, editing errors, and poorly re-rendered CGI. Series creator Joss Whedon and other members of the original team also expressed their displeasure.

The series became available on Disney+ (under the Star brand) beginning February 2021, and was added to Comet&#x27;s digital network in 2022.

==Spin-offs==
&quot;Buffy&quot; has inspired a range of official works, including television shows, books, comics, games, and podcasts. This expansion of the series encouraged use of the term &quot;Buffyverse&quot; to describe the franchise and the fictional universe in which &quot;Buffy&quot; and related stories take place.

The franchise has inspired &quot;Buffy&quot; action figures and merchandise such as official &quot;Buffy/Angel&quot; magazines and &quot;Buffy&quot; companion books. Eden Studios has published a &quot;Buffy&quot; role-playing game, while Score Entertainment has released a &quot;Buffy&quot; Collectible Card Game.

===Continuations===
The story line was continued in a series of comic books produced by Joss Whedon and published by Dark Horse Comics, which serve as a canonical continuation of the television series. The series began in 2007 with &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&quot; and was followed by &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine&quot; in 2011, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten&quot; in 2014, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eleven&quot; in 2016, and &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Twelve&quot; in 2018.

Joss Whedon was interested in a film continuation in 1998, but such a film never materialized.

====Planned reboot or sequel====
In July 2018, 20th Century Fox Television reportedly began development on a television reboot of the series. Monica Owusu-Breen was to serve as showrunner and had been working on the script with Whedon, who was to be an executive producer. News of Whedon&#x27;s involvement was seen as reassuring by fans, though the extent of his involvement was unclear; other executive producers reported to be involved included Gail Berman, Fran Kuzui, and Kaz Kuzui, all credited as executive producers for the original series. According to anonymous sources who spoke with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; and &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot;, the producers wanted the new series to be &quot;richly diverse ... [and] some aspects of the series could be seen as metaphors for issues facing society today&quot;–similar to the way Gellar described the original series as the &quot;ultimate metaphor&quot; for coping with adolescence. The producers intended &quot;for the new slayer to be African American&quot;, an example of the diversity they wish to portray. The report from &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; cautioned that &quot;the project is still in nascent stages with no script, and many details are still in flux&quot;.

At the time of &quot;Buffy&quot;&#x27;s 20th anniversary in 2017, Whedon expressed fear of reboots, commenting that when &quot;something [is brought] back, and even if it&#x27;s exactly as good as it was, the experience can&#x27;t be. You&#x27;ve already experienced it, and part of what was great was going through it for the first time. You have to meet expectations and adjust it for the climate, which is not easily [done].&quot; Similar concerns were expressed about the decision to reboot the series, rather than to revive it or further expand the Buffyverse. Reports that a black actress was to assume the iconic role of Buffy, rather than having a new character or slayer created, have been met with questions and concerns. Vox noted that &quot;the original series already had multiple characters of color who could factor into an &#x27;inclusive&#x27; reboot–including the black slayer Kendra and the &#x27;First Slayer&#x27;&quot; – leaving fans wondering &quot;why a reboot has to racebend Buffy, when it could simply focus on a different character&quot;. A Twitter message posted by Owusu-Breen on July 26, 2018, was interpreted by media outlets as indicating that the new series would not recast the role of Buffy and instead would focus on a new Slayer. In August 2022, executive producer Gail Berman announced that the series was put &quot;on pause&quot; indefinitely. In January 2024, Dolly Parton stated that the producers were still working on the reboot and were &quot;revamping it.&quot;

In February 2025, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that a &quot;Buffy&quot; sequel series was nearing a pilot order at Hulu without Whedon&#x27;s involvement. Gellar was set to reprise her role and serve as an executive producer alongside Gail Berman, Fran Kuzui, Kaz Kuzui, and Parton. Chloé Zhao was appointed as the pilot&#x27;s director, with Nora and Lilla Zuckerman credited as the writers. The new series would feature a new Slayer as the primary protagonist, while Buffy Summers would appear in a recurring role.

===&quot;Angel&quot;===
The spin-off &quot;Angel&quot; was introduced in October 1999, at the start of &quot;Buffy&quot; season four. The series was created by &quot;Buffy&quot;&#x27;s creator Joss Whedon in collaboration with David Greenwalt. Like &quot;Buffy&quot;, it was produced by the production company Mutant Enemy. At times, it performed better in the Nielsen ratings than its parent series did.

The series was given a darker tone, focusing on the ongoing trials of Angel in Los Angeles. His character is tormented by guilt following the return of his soul, punishment for more than a century of murder and torture. During the first four seasons of the show, he works as a private detective in a fictionalized version of Los Angeles, California, where he and his associates work to &quot;help the helpless&quot;, to restore the faith and &quot;save the souls&quot; of those who have lost their way. Typically, this mission involves doing battle with demons or demonically allied humans (primarily the law firm Wolfram &amp; Hart), while Angel must also contend with his own violent nature. In season five, the Senior Partners of Wolfram and Hart take a bold gamble in their campaign to corrupt Angel, giving him control of their Los Angeles office. Angel accepts the deal as an opportunity to fight evil from the inside.

In addition to Boreanaz, &quot;Angel&quot; inherited &quot;Buffy&quot; series cast regular Charisma Carpenter (Cordelia Chase). When Glenn Quinn (Doyle) left the series during its first season, Alexis Denisof (Wesley Wyndam-Pryce), who played a recurring character in the last nine episodes of season three of &quot;Buffy&quot;, took his place. Carpenter and Denisof were followed later by Mercedes McNab (Harmony Kendall) and James Marsters (Spike). Several actors and actresses who played &quot;Buffy&quot; characters made guest appearances on &quot;Angel&quot;, including Seth Green (Daniel &quot;Oz&quot; Osbourne), Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy Summers), Eliza Dushku (Faith), Tom Lenk (Andrew Wells), Alyson Hannigan (Willow Rosenberg), Julie Benz (Darla), Mark Metcalf (The Master), Julia Lee (Anne Steele) and Juliet Landau (Drusilla). Angel also continued to appear occasionally on &quot;Buffy&quot;.

Other actors that appeared in both the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; series but as different characters include: Bob Fimiani as Mr. Ward, a head of the Department of Defense in &quot;Buffy&quot; and Glith-roo, a Codger Demon in &quot;Angel&quot;; Carlos Jacott as a demon named Ken in &quot;Buffy&quot; and a different demon named Richard Straley in &quot;Angel&quot;; Jonathan M. Woodward as a vampire and former classmate in &quot;Buffy&quot; named Holden Webster and Knox, a Wolfram and Hart scientist in &quot;Angel&quot;; and Andy Umberger who played a demon named D&#x27;Hoffryn in &quot;Buffy&quot; and a predator named Ronald Meltzer in &quot;Angel&quot;.

The storyline has been continued in the comic book series &quot;&quot; published by IDW Publishing and later &quot;Angel and Faith&quot; published by Dark Horse Comics.

=== Expanded universe ===
The series&#x27; fiction has been officially expanded and elaborated on by authors and artists in the so-called &quot;Buffyverse Expanded Universe&quot;. The creators of these works may or may not keep to established continuity. Similarly, writers for the TV series were under no obligation to use information which had been established by the Expanded Universe, and sometimes contradicted such continuity.

Dark Horse has published the &quot;Buffy&quot; comics since 1998. In 2003, Whedon wrote an eight-issue miniseries for Dark Horse Comics titled &quot;Fray&quot;, about a Slayer in the future. Following the publication of &quot;Tales of the Vampires&quot; in 2004, &quot;Dark Horse Comics&quot; halted publication on Buffyverse-related comics and graphic novels. The company produced Whedon&#x27;s &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&quot; with forty issues from March 2007 to January 2011, picking up where the television show left off—taking the place of an eighth canonical season. The first story arc is also written by Whedon and is called &quot;The Long Way Home&quot;, which has been widely well-received, with circulation rivaling industry leaders DC and Marvel&#x27;s top-selling titles. After &quot;The Long Way Home&quot; came other story arcs like Faith&#x27;s return in &quot;No Future for You&quot; and a &quot;Fray&quot; crossover in &quot;Time of Your Life&quot;. Dark Horse later followed &quot;Season Eight&quot; with &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine&quot;, starting in 2011, and &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten&quot;, which began in 2014. Dark Horse continued to publish &quot;Buffy&quot; comics continuing the story after the television show until September 2018, when it released the final issue of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Twelve&quot;, which intended to bring closure to the series. Following the end of Dark Horse&#x27;s &quot;Buffy&quot; series, Boom! Studios acquired the license to publish &quot;Buffy&quot; comics. Taking a different approach from Dark Horse, Boom! Studios decided to publish a new rebooted &quot;Buffy&quot; series in 2019 with many elements updated to be more contemporary. Boom! Studio&#x27;s approach to rebooting &quot;Buffy&quot; has been stylistically compared to the &quot;Ultimate Marvel&quot; series by the creators. Joss Whedon is not as involved in the rebooted &quot;Buffy&quot; comic as he was in Dark Horse&#x27;s continuation, however he did take part in the initial development stages for the series and gave his blessing to the creators.

Simon &amp; Schuster holds the license to produce &quot;Buffy&quot; novels, of which they published more than sixty between 1998 and 2008, under their Pocket Books and Simon Pulse imprints. These sometimes flesh out background information on characters; for example, &quot;Go Ask Malice&quot; details the events that lead up to Faith arriving in Sunnydale. The most recent novels include &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot;, &quot;Blackout&quot;, &quot;Portal Through Time&quot;, &quot;Bad Bargain&quot;, &quot;The Deathless&quot; and &quot;One Thing or Your Mother&quot;. After a ten-year hiatus, two additional novels were published in 2019 and 2020, following on from story threads in the comic book series.

Five official &quot;Buffy&quot; video games have been released on portable and home consoles. Most notably, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; for Xbox in 2002 and &quot;Chaos Bleeds&quot; for GameCube, Xbox and PlayStation 2 in 2003.

In September 2023, an audio series titled &quot;Slayers: A Buffyverse Story&quot; was announced, to premiere on October 12, 2023, on Audible. The series is set 10 years after the events of the series finale and the story is led by Spike (James Marsters); also returning are Charisma Carpenter, Anthony Head, Juliet Landau, Emma Caulfield, Amber Benson, James C. Leary, and Danny Strong. The series was written by Benson and Christopher Golden, and directed by Benson, Golden, and Kc Wayland. In February 2024, Audible canceled the series after one season.

===Undeveloped spinoffs===
The popularity of &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; has led to attempts to develop more on-screen ventures in the fictional &#x27;Buffyverse&#x27;. These projects remain undeveloped and may never be greenlit. In 2002, two potential spinoffs were in discussion: &quot;&quot; and &quot;Ripper&quot;. &quot;Buffy: The Animated Series&quot; was a proposed animated TV show based on &quot;Buffy&quot;; Whedon and Jeph Loeb were to be executive producers for the show, and most of the cast from &quot;Buffy&quot; were to return to voice their characters. 20th Century Fox showed an interest in developing and selling the show to another network. A three-minute pilot was completed in 2004 but was never picked up. Whedon revealed to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;: &quot;We just could not find a home for it. We had six or seven hilarious scripts from our own staff–and nobody wanted it.&quot; Writer Jane Espenson has teased small extracts from some of her scripts for the show.

&quot;Ripper&quot; was originally a proposed television show based upon the character of Rupert Giles portrayed by Anthony Stewart Head. More recent information has suggested that if &quot;Ripper&quot; were ever made, it would be a TV movie or a DVD movie. There was little heard about the series until 2007 when Joss Whedon confirmed that talks were almost completed for a 90-minute &quot;Ripper&quot; special on the BBC with both Head and the BBC completely on board.

In 2003, a year after the first public discussions on &quot;Buffy: The Animated Series&quot; and &quot;Ripper&quot;, &quot;Buffy&quot; was nearing its end. Espenson said during the time spin-offs were being discussed, &quot;I think Marti talked with Joss about &quot;Slayer School&quot; and Tim Minear talked with him about Faith on a motorcycle. I assume there was some back-and-forth pitching.&quot; Espenson has revealed that &quot;Slayer School&quot; might have used new slayers and potentially included Willow Rosenberg, but Whedon did not think that such a spinoff felt right.

Dushku declined the pitch for a Buffyverse TV series based on Faith and instead agreed to a deal to produce &quot;Tru Calling&quot;. Dushku explained to IGN: &quot;It would have been a really hard thing to do, and not that I would not have been up for a challenge, but with it coming on immediately following &quot;Buffy&quot;, I think that those would have been really big boots to fill.&quot; Tim Minear explained some of the ideas behind the aborted series: &quot;The show was basically going to be Faith meets &quot;Kung Fu&quot;. It would have been Faith, probably on a motorcycle, crossing the earth, trying to find her place in the world.&quot;

Finally, during the summer of 2004 after the end of &quot;Angel&quot;, a movie about Spike was proposed. The movie would have been directed by Tim Minear and starred Marsters and Amy Acker and featured Alyson Hannigan. Outside the 2006 Saturn Awards, Whedon announced that he had pitched the concept to various bodies but had yet to receive any feedback.

In September 2008, &quot;Sci-Fi Wire&quot; ran an interview with Sarah Michelle Gellar in which she said she would not rule out returning to her most iconic role: &quot;Never say never&quot;, she said. &quot;One of the reasons the original &quot;Buffy&quot; movie did not really work on the big screen–and people blamed Kristy, but that&#x27;s not what it was–the story was better told over a long arc&quot;, Gellar said. &quot;And I worry about Buffy as a &#x27;beginning, middle and end&#x27; so quickly. ... You show me a script; you show me that it works, and you show me that [the] audience can accept that, [and] I&#x27;d probably be there. Those are what my hesitations are.&quot;

==Legacy and cultural impact==

===Academia===
&quot;Buffy&quot; is notable for attracting the interest of scholars of popular culture, as a subset of popular culture studies, and some academic settings include the show as a topic of literary study and analysis. National Public Radio describes &quot;Buffy&quot; as having a &quot;special following among academics, some of whom have staked a claim in what they call &#x27;Buffy Studies.&#x27;&quot; Though not widely recognized as a distinct discipline, the term &quot;Buffy studies&quot; is commonly used amongst the peer-reviewed academic &quot;Buffy&quot;-related writings. The influence of &quot;Buffy&quot; on the depiction of vampires across popular culture has also been noted by anthropologists such as A. Asbjørn Jøn. Popular media researcher Rob Cover argued that Buffy and Angel speak to contemporary attitudes to identity, inclusion, and diversity, and that critiquing the characters&#x27; long-narrative stories lends insight into the complexity of identity in the current era and the landscape of social issues in which those identities are performed.

Critics have responded to the academic attention the series has received. For example, Jes Battis, who authored &quot;Blood Relations in Buffy and Angel&quot;, admits that study of the Buffyverse &quot;invokes an uneasy combination of enthusiasm and ire&quot;, and meets &quot;a certain amount of disdain from within the halls of the academy&quot;. Nonetheless, &quot;Buffy&quot; eventually led to the publication of around twenty books and hundreds of articles examining the themes of the show from a wide range of disciplinary perspectives, including sociology, Speech Communication, psychology, philosophy, and women&#x27;s studies. In a 2012 study by &quot;Slate&quot;, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; was named the most studied pop culture work by academics, with more than 200 papers, essays, and books devoted to the series.

The Whedon Studies Association produces the online academic journal &quot;Slayage&quot; and sponsors a biennial academic conference on the works of Whedon. The sixth &quot;Biennial Slayage Conference&quot;, titled &quot;Much Ado About Whedon&quot;, was held at California State University-Sacramento in late June 2014.

===Fandom and fan films===

The popularity of &quot;Buffy&quot; has led to the creation of websites, online discussion forums, works of &quot;Buffy&quot; fan fiction, and several unofficial fan-made productions. Since the end of the series, Whedon has stated that his intention was to produce a cult television series and has acknowledged the &quot;rabid, almost insane fan base&quot; that the show has created. In 2016, Jenny Owen Youngs and Kristin Russo began the &quot;Buffering the Vampire Slayer&quot; podcast, recognized as one of the top podcasts in production by &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Esquire&quot; magazines. In 2017 the 20th anniversary of the show attracted even more writers to create their own adventures of the series&#x27; characters.

===&quot;Buffy&quot; in popular culture===

The series employed pop culture references as a frequent humorous device, and has itself become a frequent pop culture reference in video games, comics and television shows. The series has also been parodied and spoofed. Sarah Michelle Gellar has participated in several parody sketches, including a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch in which the Slayer is relocated to the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; universe, and adding her voice to an episode of &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; that parodied a would-be eighth season of &quot;Buffy&quot;.

&quot;Buffy&quot; was the code-name used for an early HTC mobile phone which integrated the social networking website Facebook.

In March 2017, in honor of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&#x27;s&quot; 20th anniversary, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reunited Joss Whedon and the whole cast for their first joint interview and photo shoot in over a decade.

===U.S. television ratings===
&quot;Buffy&quot; helped put The WB on the ratings map, but by the time the series landed on UPN in 2001, viewing figures had fallen. The series&#x27; high came during the third season, with 5.3 million viewers (including repeats), possibly due to the fact that both Gellar and Hannigan had hit movies out during the season (&quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; and &quot;American Pie&quot; respectively). The series&#x27; low came in season one at 3.7 million. The series finale &quot;Chosen&quot; pulled in a season high of 4.9 million viewers on the UPN network.

The WB was impressed with the young audience the show was bringing in, and ordered a full season of 22 episodes for season two. &quot;Buffy&quot; was moved from Monday at 9:00 pm to launch The WB&#x27;s new night of programming on Tuesday, starting with the episode &quot;Innocence&quot;, watched by 8.2 million people. Due to its success in that time slot, it remained on Tuesdays at 8:00 pm for the remainder of its original run, and became one of the network&#x27;s highest-rated shows.

In the 2001–2002 season, the show moved to UPN after a negotiation dispute with The WB. While it was still one of the highest rated shows on their network, The WB felt that it had peaked and thus declined a salary increase to the cast and crew. UPN then picked the series up for a two-season renewal, dedicating a two-hour premiere to help re-launch it. The following season premiere attracted the second highest rating of the series, with 7.7 million viewers.

===Impact on television===
&quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; became a pop culture phenomenon and is considered as iconic. Commentators of the entertainment industry including &quot;AllMovie&quot;, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, &quot;PopMatters&quot;, &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; cite &quot;Buffy&quot; as &quot;influential&quot;, with some describing it as the ascent of television into its golden age. Stephanie Zacharek, in the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, wrote, &quot;If we really are in a golden age of television, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; was a harbinger.&quot; Robert Moore of &quot;PopMatters&quot; expressed similar sentiments, writing &quot;TV was not art before &quot;Buffy&quot;, but it was afterwards&quot;, suggesting that it was responsible for re-popularizing long story arcs on primetime television. The show is often seen as one of the greatest shows of all-time and for being groundbreaking and influential for the landscape of television. David Simon, creator of &quot;The Wire&quot;, considered &quot;Buffy&quot; as &quot;the best show in years&quot;.

&quot;Buffy&quot;″s effect on programming was quickly evident. Autumn 2003 saw several new shows going into production in the U.S. that featured strong females forced to come to terms with supernatural power or destiny while trying to maintain a normal life. These post-&quot;Buffy&quot; shows include &quot;Dead Like Me&quot;, &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot;, &quot;Tru Calling&quot;, &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; and &quot;Teen Wolf&quot;. Bryan Fuller, the creator of &quot;Dead Like Me&quot;, said that &quot;&quot;Buffy&quot; showed that young women could be in situations that were both fantastic and relatable, and instead of shunting women off to the side, it puts them at the center.&quot; In the United Kingdom, the lessons learned from the impact of &quot;Buffy&quot; influenced the revived &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series (2005–present), as well as its spinoff series &quot;Torchwood&quot;. Reviewers noted that shows such as &quot;Legacies&quot; and &quot;Riverdale&quot; took inspiration from &quot;Buffy&quot; involving the &quot;Dark Willow&quot; story arc.

Several &quot;Buffy&quot; alumni have gone on to write for or create other shows. Such endeavors include &quot;Tru Calling&quot; (Douglas Petrie, Jane Espenson and lead actress Eliza Dushku), &quot;Wonderfalls&quot; (Tim Minear), &quot;Point Pleasant&quot; (Marti Noxon), &quot;Jake 2.0&quot; (David Greenwalt), &quot;The Inside&quot; (Tim Minear), &quot;Smallville&quot; (Steven S. DeKnight), &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; (Jane Espenson), &quot;Lost&quot; (Drew Goddard and David Fury), and &quot;Daredevil&quot; (Goddard, DeKnight, and Petrie). TV Tropes, a website devoted to pop culture tropes, claimed that &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; is the reason why the site exists. The show also had a significant impact on slang in popular culture. The series also served as inspiration for television writers such as Shonda Rhimes, Eric Kripke, Rob Thomas and Amy Sherman-Palladino. In 2015, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; wrote that &quot;Buffy&quot; is &quot;still revolutionary&quot; and &quot;subversive&quot;. &quot;The Daily Orange&quot; wrote &quot;Buffy led the third-wave feminist mouvement in pop culture&quot;, talking about how the series led the cause for women leads on TV.

Several critics have noted series such as &quot;Orphan Black&quot;, &quot;The Magicians&quot;, &quot;Jessica Jones&quot; and &quot;Wynonna Earp&quot; as being worthy successors to &quot;Buffy&quot;. At the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con, the authors Rachel Hawkins, Kiersten White, Rae Carson, Brittany Geragotelis and Valerie Tejeda talked about the Buffy effect on heroines in fiction and how Buffy was a big influence on writing their books.

Meanwhile, the Parents Television Council complained of efforts to &quot;deluge their young viewing audiences with adult themes&quot;. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), however, rejected the council&#x27;s indecency complaint concerning the violent sex scene between Buffy and Spike in &quot;Smashed&quot;. The BBC, however, chose to censor some of the more controversial sexual content when it was shown on the pre-watershed 6:45 pm slot.

Show characters Willow Rosenberg and Tara Maclay were one of the first lesbian couples to be shown on public broadcast television. This was important representation at the time, as it challenged many social stereotypes about gay women. It did not over-sexualize them and instead allowed them to be seen as independent people in a fairly healthy relationship. Creator Joss Whedon has said in interviews that he was initially told by the network he could not include a bisexual character in the show, however, in later seasons as cultural opinions on LGBT issues began to shift, he was allowed to introduce Willow and Tara as being in a relationship with one another. At first they were only seen talking and holding hands as they were not allowed to be shown kissing, until in 2002, the show showed the girlfriends in bed together, which though not a sex scene was considered the first scene of its kind for a broadcast network series. The following year, the show featured the first lesbian sex scene in broadcast TV history.

===Awards and nominations===
&quot;Buffy&quot; has gathered a number of awards and nominations which include an Emmy Award nomination for the 1999 episode &quot;Hush,&quot; which featured an extended sequence with no character dialogue. The 2001 episode &quot;The Body&quot; was filmed with no musical score, only diegetic music; it was nominated for a Nebula Award in 2002. The 2001 musical episode &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot; received plaudits, but was omitted from Emmy nomination ballots by &quot;accident&quot;. It since was featured on &quot;Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Musicals&quot;&quot;. In 2001, Sarah Michelle Gellar received a Golden Globe-nomination for Best Actress in a TV Series-Drama for her role in the show, as well nominations for the Teen Choice Awards and the Saturn Award for Best Genre TV Actress. The series won the Drama Category for Television&#x27;s Most Memorable Moment at the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards for &quot;The Gift&quot; beating &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot; and &quot;Dallas&quot;, although the sequence for this award was not aired.

It was nominated for Emmy and Golden Globe awards, winning a total of three Emmys. However, snubs in lead Emmy categories resulted in outrage among TV critics and the decision by the academy to hold a tribute event in honor of the series after it had gone off the air in 2003.

<doc id="47543" wikidata="Q191965" url="?curid=47543" title="Zero Wing">
<text>is a horizontally scrolling shooter developed by Toaplan and published in Japan by Namco in 1991 as an arcade video game. It was released in North America by Williams Electronics. Controlling the ZIG space fighter craft, players assume the role of protagonist Trent in a last-ditch effort to overthrow the alien space pirate organization CATS (Abigor in the PC-Engine version). It was the eighth shoot &#x27;em up game from Toaplan, and their fourteenth video game overall.

Headed by development chief Toshiaki Ōta, &quot;Zero Wing&quot; was created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Toaplan, initially starting as a project not intended for commercial release but to train new recruits before being ultimately released to the market. Although first launched in arcades, the game was later ported to other platforms, each one featuring several changes or additions compared with the original version.

&quot;Zero Wing&quot; enjoyed a degree of success in arcades and its home conversions were met with mostly positive reception from critics. The European Mega Drive version later gained renewed popularity due to the &quot;All your base are belong to us&quot; internet meme, which plays off the badly translated introductory cutscene. The rights to the title are owned by Tatsujin, a Japanese company formed by Masahiro Yuge. The Mega Drive version was later released in North America by independent publisher Retro-Bit in 2020.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Zero Wing&quot; is a science fiction-themed side-scrolling shooter similar to &quot;Hellfire&quot;, where players assume the role of Trent taking control of the ZIG space fighter craft through eight increasingly difficult levels, each with a boss at the end that must be fought before progressing any further, in a last-ditch effort to overthrow the alien cyborg CATS as the main objective. As far as side-scrolling shooters go, the title initially appears to be very standard, as players control their craft over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until the stage boss is reached.

A unique gameplay feature is the &quot;Seizer Beam&quot; system; During gameplay, players can grab certain enemies and hold them as shield against enemy fire or launch them against enemies. There are three types of weapons in the game that can be switched between after destroying incoming carriers by picking up a color-changing item ranging from the &quot;Red Cannon&quot; shot, the &quot;Blue Laser&quot; and the &quot;Green Homing&quot; missiles. Each weapon can be upgraded by picking up an item of the same color. Other items can also be grabbed along the way such as speed increasers, 1UPs and a bomb module capable of obliterating any enemy caught within its blast radius that can also be triggered after taking enemy hits.

Depending on the settings in the arcade version, the title uses either a checkpoint system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying, or a respawn system where their ship immediately starts at the location where they died. Getting hit by enemy fire or colliding against solid stage obstacles will result in losing a life, as well as a penalty of decreasing the ship&#x27;s firepower and speed to his original state and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless the players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. The game loops back to the first stage after completing the last stage as with previous titles from Toaplan, with each one increasing the difficulty and enemies fire denser bullet patterns as well as spawning extra bullets when destroyed.

== Synopsis ==
The backstory of &quot;Zero Wing&quot; varies between each version, but the plot within the game itself remains consistent. Set in 2101, the game follows the signing of a peace treaty between the United Nations (also translated as the Milky Way Federation) and CATS, a space pirate organization. However, CATS breaks the covenant and takes control of the Japanese/Federation space colonies. The protagonist Trent leads a ZIG space craft, which had managed to escape from a mothership destroyed by CATS&#x27; representative, with the aim to defeat enemy forces, avenge the mothership and its crew and liberate the Earth. On the PC Engine version however, the story is different. CATS are replaced with an organization called Abigor led by a man named Ludwig and his right-hand woman Seiren. Abigor attack the Galactic Federation and the ZIG, piloted by Masato Tachibana, is send to repel them before it is eventually revealed the Federation dispatcher&#x27;s sister Airen, who had worked as an undercover spy alerting the Federation of Abigor&#x27;s attack, is arrested by Seiren who turns her in to Ludwig. After Ludwig chooses to spare Airen&#x27;s life, Tachibana then ends up getting into communication with Ludwig who challenges him to a battle with a condition to give Airen back if Tachibana wins. Tachibana accepts and blows up Ludwig&#x27;s ship, Ludwig giving up Airen before committing suicide. Airen and Tachibana then celebrate their victory before returning to Earth offscreen.

== Development ==
&quot;Zero Wing&quot; was created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Toaplan, with members of the development staff recounting its history through various Japanese publications. Toshiaki Ōta was at the helm as development chief and also served as programmer alongside Hiroaki Furukawa and Tatsuya Uemura. Uemura also acted as composer along with Masahiro Yuge and Toshiaki Tomizawa. Artists Miho Hayashi, Naoki Ogiwara and Shintarō Nakaoka created the artwork while Sanae Nitō and Yuko Tataka served as character designers.

Uemura stated that &quot;Zero Wing&quot; originally started as a project not intended for commercial launch to train new recruits at Toaplan, handling training for new hires while using his work and engine from &quot;Hellfire&quot; before ultimately deciding with releasing the game to the market, which made it a more practical learning experience for the new developers. However, Uemura felt that both stage design and characters were &quot;cobbled together&quot;, leading the game&#x27;s world being &quot;kind of a mess&quot; and he also stated the project turned into a &quot;battle royale&quot;, as staff from both &quot;Hellfire&quot; and &quot;Truxton&quot; were mixed with the new recruits. Sound also proved to be very divisive as Uemura, Yuge and Tomizawa wrote several songs for the game with their own individual styles, though Uemura claimed this was due to dividing the work, while Yuge stated he would go to rest and drink after being stuck when composing for the title during work hours. Due to being a training project, Uemura stated the team had freedom to &quot;just fool around&quot; and several features were integrated into the title such as warps, which was taken from &quot;Slap Fight&quot;. Uemura also revealed that the reason for enemies spawning suicide bullets during loops of higher difficulty was in response to hardware limitations regarding sprites. Both the single-player and co-op versions were also planned from the beginning of development due to pressure to make two-player games at the time. The alien Pipiru was designed by Ogiwara, though Uemura claimed such character was not planned.

The Sega Mega Drive version of &quot;Zero Wing&quot; was created by the same staff from the original arcade release, with Uemura overseeing development in-house. Both Uemura and Tataka have stated that working with the Mega Drive proved to be difficult due to several restrictions imposed by the hardware. According to both Uemura and Yuge, the poor English translation in the Mega Drive version was handled by a then-member of Toaplan in charge of export and overseas business, whose English was &quot;really terrible&quot;. The Mega Drive port features arranged music by Noriyuki Iwadare. The PC Engine CD-ROM² version was outsourced by an &quot;acquaintance&quot; from defunct developer Orca, with Uemura handling sound.

== Release ==
&quot;Zero Wing&quot; was first released in arcades in October 1989 by Namco in Japan, and then by Williams Electronics for North America in April 1990. In 1989, an album containing music from the title was co-published exclusively in Japan by Scitron and Pony Canyon.

&quot;Zero Wing&quot; was first ported to the Sega Mega Drive by Toaplan and was first published in Japan on 31 May 1991 and later in Europe by Sega in July 1991. The game was later converted to the PC Engine CD-ROM² add-on and was published exclusively in Japan by Naxat Soft on 18 September 1992. The Japanese release is able to play fine on American Sega Genesis consoles. Like most early titles it had no region protection, nor had the European release been PAL-optimized. To expand the plot, the Mega Drive version added an introductory sequence to the game. This introduction does not appear in the arcade original nor in the PC Engine CD-ROM² versions; rather, a different intro takes place with a blue-windowed ZIG. The PC Engine CD-ROM² added two new levels — 5th (Deeva) and 10th (Vacura).

The Mega Drive port was later released in North America by independent publisher Retro-Bit in 2020. &quot;Zero Wing&quot; was included as part of the &quot;Toaplan Arcade 1&quot; compilation for Evercade, released on 15 December 2022. On 30 June 2022, &quot;Zero Wing&quot; was re-released on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack.

On 18 August 2022, Bitwave Games and Toaplan jointly announced that &quot;Zero Wing&quot; would be releasing onto Steam as a standalone title in 2022, and will also be available in a game bundle along with &quot;Twin Cobra&quot;, &quot;Truxton&quot;, and &quot;Out Zone&quot;. The Steam release will include a &quot;range of quality-of-life enhancements, such as stunning pixel-perfect graphics, rewind, achievements, online leaderboards, sidebar indicators, and a brand new Very Easy mode&quot;. Following a delay, it was released on Steam and GOG.com on 14 February 2023.

== Reception ==

In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Zero Wing&quot; on their 15 November 1989 issue as being the fourth most-successful table arcade unit of the month, outperforming titles such as &quot;Jitsuryoku!! Pro Yakyū&quot; and &quot;U.N. Squadron&quot;.

The game received a positive critical reception upon release. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; scored it 93%, including ratings of 92% for graphics, 93% for sound, 90% for playability, and 89% for lastability. They praised &quot;the great intro sequence&quot;, &quot;super-smooth gameplay, beautifully defined graphics, rocking sound track, amazing explosions and incredible end-of-level bosses&quot;, concluding that it is &quot;the game which breaths (&quot;sic&quot;) new life into shoot &#x27;em ups on the Megadrive&quot;. &quot;Mean Machines&quot; scored it 91%, including ratings of 92% for presentation and graphics, 88% for sound, 90% for playability, and 89% for lastability. They praised the &quot;ace&quot; opening sequence, &quot;detailed&quot; graphics, &quot;real good&quot; music, and skill-based gameplay, concluding that it is one of &quot;the best Megadrive blasts in ages.&quot; &quot;Sega Force&quot; scored it 86%, including ratings of 84% for presentation, 89% for visuals, 83% for sound, 89% for playability, and 82% for lastability. They praised the &quot;animated intro&quot; sequence, &quot;smart&quot; graphics, &quot;up-beat Jap tune&quot; music, and the accessible but &quot;highly involved&quot; gameplay, concluding that it is &quot;almost as good as &quot;Hellfire&quot;&quot; but &quot;not quite.&quot;

&quot;Complex&quot; ranked Zero Wing 98th on their &quot;The 100 Best Sega Genesis Games.&quot;

== Legacy ==
&quot;Zero Wing&quot; was the last side-scrolling shoot &#x27;em up title to be developed by Toaplan, as the developers believed they did not know how to make a side-scrolling shooter interesting, despite positive reception from players. 

&quot;Zero Wing&quot; is one of the most widely-known examples of poor linguistic translation in video games. Translations were handled internally by the design team, not with a professional translator. In 1999, the introduction cutscene for the Sega Mega Drive version of &quot;Zero Wing&quot; was re-discovered, culminating in the wildly popular &quot;All your base are belong to us&quot; Internet meme. 

&quot;Zero Wing&quot; is also of interest in the field of translation studies in the context of its multiple endings. As noted by Clyde Mandelin, who reverse engineered the original game, while the English-language version had three different post-credit endings, the Japanese version had thirty-five. Many of those endings referenced then-current Japanese popular culture in ways that would have been hard to translate across cultures, and suggests that the text was written by someone who grew up in the 1960s or 1970s. 

In more recent years, the rights to &quot;Zero Wing&quot; and many other IPs from Toaplan are now owned by Tatsujin, a company named after &quot;Truxton&quot;″s Japanese title that was founded in 2017 by former Toaplan employee Masahiro Yuge, and is part of Embracer Group since 2022.
