<text>The Umayyad Caliphate or Umayyad Empire (, ; ) was the second caliphate established after the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and was ruled by the Umayyad dynasty. Uthman ibn Affan, the third of the Rashidun caliphs, was also a member of the clan. The family established dynastic, hereditary rule with Mu&#x27;awiya I, the long-time governor of Greater Syria, who became caliph after the end of the First Fitna in 661. Syria remained the Umayyads&#x27; main power base thereafter, with Damascus as their capital. After Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s death in 680, conflicts over the succession resulted in the Second Fitna, and power eventually fell to Marwan I, from another branch of the clan. 

The Umayyads continued the Muslim conquests, conquering Ifriqiya, Transoxiana, Sind, the Maghreb and Hispania (al-Andalus). At its greatest extent (661–750), the Umayyad Caliphate covered , making it one of the largest empires in history in terms of area. The dynasty was toppled by the Abbasids in 750. Survivors of the dynasty established themselves in Córdoba which, in the form of an emirate and then a caliphate, became a world centre of science, medicine, philosophy and invention during the Islamic Golden Age.

The Umayyad Caliphate ruled over a vast multiethnic and multicultural population. Christians, who still constituted a majority of the caliphate&#x27;s population, and Jews were allowed to practice their own religion but had to pay the &quot;jizya&quot; (poll tax) from which Muslims were exempt. Muslims were required to pay the zakat, which was earmarked or hypothecated explicitly for various alms programmes for the benefit of Muslims or Muslim converts. Under the early Umayyad caliphs, prominent positions were held by Christians, some of whom belonged to families that had served the Byzantines. The employment of Christians was part of a broader policy of religious accommodation that was necessitated by the presence of large Christian populations in the conquered provinces, as in Syria. This policy also boosted Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s popularity and solidified Syria as his power base. The Umayyad era is often considered the formative period in Islamic art.

==History==

===Origins===
====Early influence====
During the pre-Islamic period, the Umayyads or Banu Umayya were a leading clan of the Quraysh tribe of Mecca. By the end of the 6th century, the Umayyads dominated the Quraysh&#x27;s increasingly prosperous trade networks with Syria and developed economic and military alliances with the nomadic Arab tribes that controlled the northern and central Arabian desert expanses, affording the clan a degree of political power in the region. The Umayyads under the leadership of Abu Sufyan ibn Harb were the principal leaders of Meccan opposition to the Islamic prophet Muhammad, but after the latter captured Mecca in 630, Abu Sufyan and the Quraysh embraced Islam. To reconcile his influential Qurayshite tribesmen, Muhammad gave his former opponents, including Abu Sufyan, a stake in the new order. Abu Sufyan and the Umayyads relocated to Medina, Islam&#x27;s political centre, to maintain their new-found political influence in the nascent Muslim community.

Muhammad&#x27;s death in 632 left open the succession of leadership of the Muslim community. Leaders of the Ansar, the natives of Medina who had provided Muhammad safe haven after his emigration from Mecca in 622, discussed forwarding their own candidate out of concern that the Muhajirun, Muhammad&#x27;s early followers and fellow emigrants from Mecca, would ally with their fellow tribesmen from the former Qurayshite elite and take control of the Muslim state. The Muhajirun gave allegiance to one of their own, the early, elderly companion of Muhammad, Abu Bakr (), and put an end to Ansarite deliberations. Abu Bakr was viewed as acceptable by the Ansar and the Qurayshite elite and was acknowledged as caliph (leader of the Muslim community). He showed favor to the Umayyads by awarding them command roles in the Muslim conquest of Syria. One of the appointees was Yazid, the son of Abu Sufyan, who owned property and maintained trade networks in Syria.

Abu Bakr&#x27;s successor Umar () curtailed the influence of the Qurayshite elite in favor of Muhammad&#x27;s earlier supporters in the administration and military, but nonetheless allowed the growing foothold of Abu Sufyan&#x27;s sons in Syria, which was all but conquered by 638. When Umar&#x27;s overall commander of the province Abu Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah died in 639, he appointed Yazid governor of Syria&#x27;s Damascus, Palestine and Jordan districts. Yazid died shortly after and Umar appointed his brother Mu&#x27;awiya in his place. Umar&#x27;s exceptional treatment of Abu Sufyan&#x27;s sons may have stemmed from his respect for the family, their burgeoning alliance with the powerful Banu Kalb tribe as a counterbalance to the influential Himyarite settlers in Homs who viewed themselves as equals to the Quraysh in nobility, or the lack of a suitable candidate at the time, particularly amid the plague of Amwas which had already killed Abu Ubayda and Yazid. Under Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s stewardship, Syria remained domestically peaceful, organized and well-defended from its former Byzantine rulers.

====Caliphate of Uthman====
Umar&#x27;s successor, Uthman ibn Affan, was a wealthy Umayyad and early Muslim convert with marital ties to Muhammad. He was elected by the &quot;shura&quot; council, composed of Muhammad&#x27;s cousin Ali, al-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam, Talha ibn Ubayd Allah, Sa&#x27;d ibn Abi Waqqas and Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf, all of whom were close, early companions of Muhammad and belonged to the Quraysh. He was chosen over Ali because he would ensure the concentration of state power into the hands of the Quraysh, as opposed to Ali&#x27;s determination to diffuse power among all of the Muslim factions. From early in his reign, Uthman displayed explicit favouritism to his kinsmen, in stark contrast to his predecessors. He appointed his family members as governors over the regions successively conquered under Umar and himself, namely much of the Sasanian Empire, i.e. Iraq and Iran, and the former Byzantine territories of Syria and Egypt. In Medina, he relied extensively on the counsel of his Umayyad cousins, the brothers al-Harith and Marwan ibn al-Hakam. According to the historian Wilferd Madelung, this policy stemmed from Uthman&#x27;s &quot;conviction that the house of Umayya, as the core clan of Quraysh, was uniquely qualified to rule in the name of Islam&quot;.

Uthman&#x27;s nepotism provoked the ire of the Ansar and the members of the &quot;shura&quot;. In 645/46, he added the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia) to Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s Syrian governorship and granted the latter&#x27;s request to take possession of all Byzantine crown lands in Syria to help pay his troops. He had the surplus taxes from the wealthy provinces of Kufa and Egypt forwarded to the treasury in Medina, which he used at his personal disposal, frequently disbursing its funds and war booty to his Umayyad relatives. Moreover, the lucrative Sasanian crown lands of Iraq, which Umar had designated as communal property for the benefit of the Arab garrison towns of Kufa and Basra, were turned into caliphal crown lands to be used at Uthman&#x27;s discretion. Mounting resentment against Uthman&#x27;s rule in Iraq and Egypt and among the Ansar and Quraysh of Medina culminated in the killing of the caliph in 656. In the assessment of the historian Hugh N. Kennedy, Uthman was killed because of his determination to centralize control over the caliphate&#x27;s government by the traditional elite of the Quraysh, particularly his Umayyad clan, which he believed possessed the &quot;experience and ability&quot; to govern, at the expense of the interests, rights and privileges of many early Muslims.

====First Fitna====
After Uthman&#x27;s assassination, Ali was recognized as caliph in Medina, though his support stemmed from the Ansar and the Iraqis, while the bulk of the Quraysh was wary of his rule. The first challenge to his authority came from the Qurayshite leaders al-Zubayr and Talha, who had opposed Uthman&#x27;s empowerment of the Umayyad clan but feared that their own influence and the power of the Quraysh, in general, would dissipate under Ali. Backed by one of Muhammad&#x27;s wives, A&#x27;isha, they attempted to rally support against Ali among the troops of Basra, prompting the caliph to leave for Iraq&#x27;s other garrison town, Kufa, where he could better confront his challengers. Ali defeated them at the Battle of the Camel, in which al-Zubayr and Talha were slain and A&#x27;isha consequently entered self-imposed seclusion. Ali&#x27;s sovereignty was thereafter recognized in Basra and Egypt and he established Kufa as the caliphate&#x27;s new capital.

Although Ali was able to replace Uthman&#x27;s governors in Egypt and Iraq with relative ease, Mu&#x27;awiya had developed a solid power-base and an effective military against the Byzantines from the Arab tribes of Syria. Mu&#x27;awiya did not claim the caliphate but was determined to retain control of Syria and opposed Ali in the name of avenging his kinsman Uthman, accusing the caliph of culpability in his death. Ali and Mu&#x27;awiya fought to a stalemate at the Battle of Siffin in early 657. Ali agreed to settle the matter with Mu&#x27;awiya by arbitration, though the talks failed to achieve a resolution. The decision to arbitrate fundamentally weakened Ali&#x27;s political position as he was forced to negotiate with Mu&#x27;awiya on equal terms, while it drove a significant number of Ali&#x27;s supporters, who became known as the Kharijites, to revolt. Ali&#x27;s coalition steadily disintegrated and many Iraqi tribal nobles secretly defected to Mu&#x27;awiya, while the latter&#x27;s ally Amr ibn al-As ousted Ali&#x27;s governor from Egypt in July 658. In July 660 Mu&#x27;awiya was formally recognized as caliph in Jerusalem by his Syrian tribal allies. Ali was assassinated by a Kharijite dissident in January 661. His son Hasan succeeded him but abdicated in return for compensation upon Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s arrival to Iraq with his Syrian army in the summer. At that point, Mu&#x27;awiya entered Kufa and received the allegiance of the Iraqis.

===Sufyanid period===
====Caliphate of Mu&#x27;awiya====
The recognition of Mu&#x27;awiya in Kufa, referred to as the &quot;year of unification of the community&quot; in the Muslim traditional sources, is generally considered the start of his caliphate. With his accession, the political capital and the caliphal treasury were transferred to Damascus, the seat of Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s power. Syria&#x27;s emergence as the metropolis of the Umayyad Caliphate was the result of Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s twenty-year entrenchment in the province, the geographic distribution of its relatively large Arab population throughout the province in contrast to their seclusion in garrison cities in other provinces, and the domination of a single tribal confederation, the Kalb-led Quda&#x27;a, as opposed to the wide array of competing tribal groups in Iraq. The long-established, formerly Christian Arab tribes in Syria, having been integrated into the military of the Byzantine Empire and their Ghassanid client kings, were &quot;more accustomed to order and obedience&quot; than their Iraqi counterparts, according to the historian Julius Wellhausen. Mu&#x27;awiya relied on the powerful Kalbite chief Ibn Bahdal and the Kindite nobleman Shurahbil ibn Simt alongside the Qurayshite commanders al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Fihri and Abd al-Rahman, the son of the prominent general Khalid ibn al-Walid, to guarantee the loyalty of the key military components of Syria. Mu&#x27;awiya preoccupied his core Syrian troops in nearly annual or bi-annual land and sea raids against Byzantium, which provided them with battlefield experience and war spoils, but secured no permanent territorial gains. Toward the end of his reign the caliph entered a thirty-year truce with Byzantine emperor Constantine IV (), obliging the Umayyads to pay the Empire an annual tribute of gold, horses and slaves.

Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s main challenge was reestablishing the unity of the Muslim community and asserting his authority and that of the caliphate in the provinces amid the political and social disintegration of the First Fitna. There remained significant opposition to his assumption of the caliphate and to a strong central government. The garrison towns of Kufa and Basra, populated by the Arab immigrants and troops who arrived during the conquest of Iraq in the 630s–640s, resented the transition of power to Syria. They remained divided, nonetheless, as both cities competed for power and influence in Iraq and its eastern dependencies and remained divided between the Arab tribal nobility and the early Muslim converts, the latter of whom were divided between the pro-Alids (loyalists of Ali) and the Kharijites, who followed their own strict interpretation of Islam. The caliph applied a decentralized approach to governing Iraq by forging alliances with its tribal nobility, such as the Kufan leader al-Ash&#x27;ath ibn Qays, and entrusting the administration of Kufa and Basra to highly experienced members of the Thaqif tribe, al-Mughira ibn Shu&#x27;ba and the latter&#x27;s protege Ziyad ibn Abihi (whom Mu&#x27;awiya adopted as his half-brother), respectively. In return for recognizing his suzerainty, maintaining order, and forwarding a token portion of the provincial tax revenues to Damascus, the caliph let his governors rule with practical independence. After al-Mughira&#x27;s death in 670, Mu&#x27;awiya attached Kufa and its dependencies to the governorship of Basra, making Ziyad the practical viceroy over the eastern half of the caliphate. Afterward, Ziyad launched a concerted campaign to firmly establish Arab rule in the vast Khurasan region east of Iran and restart the Muslim conquests in the surrounding areas. Not long after Ziyad&#x27;s death, he was succeeded by his son Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad. Meanwhile, Amr ibn al-As ruled Egypt from the provincial capital of Fustat as a virtual partner of Mu&#x27;awiya until his death in 663, after which loyalist governors were appointed and the province became a practical appendage of Syria. Under Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s direction, the Muslim conquest of Ifriqiya (central North Africa) was launched by the commander Uqba ibn Nafi in 670, which extended Umayyad control as far as Byzacena (modern southern Tunisia), where Uqba founded the permanent Arab garrison city of Kairouan.

====Succession of Yazid I and collapse of Sufyanid rule====
In contrast to Uthman, Mu&#x27;awiya restricted the influence of his Umayyad kinsmen to the governorship of Medina, where the dispossessed Islamic elite, including the Umayyads, was suspicious or hostile toward his rule. However, in an unprecedented move in Islamic politics, Mu&#x27;awiya nominated his own son, Yazid I, as his successor in 676, introducing hereditary rule to caliphal succession and, in practice, turning the office of the caliph into a kingship. The act was met with disapproval or opposition by the Iraqis and the Hejaz-based Quraysh, including the Umayyads, but most were bribed or coerced into acceptance. Yazid acceded after Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s death in 680 and almost immediately faced a challenge to his rule by the Kufan partisans of Ali who had invited Ali&#x27;s son and Muhammad&#x27;s grandson Husayn to stage a revolt against Umayyad rule from Iraq. An army mobilized by Iraq&#x27;s governor Ibn Ziyad intercepted and killed Husayn outside Kufa at the Battle of Karbala. Although it stymied active opposition to Yazid in Iraq, the killing of Muhammad&#x27;s grandson left many Muslims outraged and significantly increased Kufan hostility toward the Umayyads and sympathy for the family of Ali.

The next major challenge to Yazid&#x27;s rule emanated from the Hejaz where Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, the son of al-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam and grandson of Abu Bakr, advocated for a &quot;shura&quot; among the Quraysh to elect the caliph and rallied opposition to the Umayyads from his headquarters in Islam&#x27;s holiest sanctuary, the Ka&#x27;aba in Mecca. The Ansar and Quraysh of Medina also took up the anti-Umayyad cause and in 683 expelled the Umayyads from the city. Yazid&#x27;s Syrian troops routed the Medinans at the Battle of al-Harra and subsequently plundered Medina before besieging Ibn al-Zubayr in Mecca. The Syrians withdrew upon news of Yazid&#x27;s death in 683, after which Ibn al-Zubayr declared himself caliph and soon after gained recognition in most provinces of the caliphate, including Iraq and Egypt. In Syria Ibn Bahdal secured the succession of Yazid&#x27;s son and appointed successor Mu&#x27;awiya II, whose authority was likely restricted to Damascus and Syria&#x27;s southern districts. Mu&#x27;awiya II had been ill from the beginning of his accession, with al-Dahhak assuming the practical duties of his office, and he died in early 684 without naming a successor. His death marked the end of the Umayyads&#x27; Sufyanid ruling house, called after Mu&#x27;awiya I&#x27;s father Abu Sufyan.

===Early Marwanid period===
====Marwanid transition and end of Second Fitna====
Umayyad authority nearly collapsed in their Syrian stronghold after the death of Mu&#x27;awiya II. Al-Dahhak in Damascus, the Qays tribes in Qinnasrin (northern Syria) and the Jazira, the Judham in Palestine, and the Ansar and South Arabians of Homs all opted to recognize Ibn al-Zubayr. Marwan ibn al-Hakam, the leader of the Umayyads expelled to Syria from Medina, was prepared to submit to Ibn al-Zubayr as well but was persuaded to forward his candidacy for the caliphate by Ibn Ziyad. The latter had been driven out of Iraq and strove to uphold Umayyad rule. During a summit of pro-Umayyad Syrian tribes, namely the Quda&#x27;a and their Kindite allies, organized by Ibn Bahdal in the old Ghassanid capital of Jabiya, Marwan was elected caliph in exchange for economic privileges to the loyalist tribes. At the subsequent Battle of Marj Rahit in August 684, Marwan led his tribal allies to a decisive victory against a much larger Qaysite army led by al-Dahhak, who was slain. Not long after, the South Arabians of Homs and the Judham joined the Quda&#x27;a to form the tribal confederation of Yaman. Marj Rahit led to the long-running conflict between the Qays and Yaman coalitions. The Qays regrouped in the Euphrates river fortress of Circesium under Zufar ibn al-Harith al-Kilabi and moved to avenge their losses. Although Marwan regained full control of Syria in the months following the battle, the inter-tribal strife undermined the foundation of Umayyad power: the Syrian army.

In 685, Marwan and Ibn Bahdal expelled the Zubayrid governor of Egypt and replaced him with Marwan&#x27;s son Abd al-Aziz, who would rule the province until his death in 704/05. Another son, Muhammad, was appointed to suppress Zufar&#x27;s rebellion in the Jazira. Marwan died in April 685 and was succeeded by his eldest son Abd al-Malik. Although Ibn Ziyad attempted to restore the Syrian army of the Sufyanid caliphs, persistent divisions along Qays–Yaman lines contributed to the army&#x27;s massive rout and Ibn Ziyad&#x27;s death at the hands of the pro-Alid forces of Mukhtar al-Thaqafi of Kufa at the Battle of Khazir in August 686. The setback delayed Abd al-Malik&#x27;s attempts to reestablish Umayyad authority in Iraq, while pressures from the Byzantine Empire and raids into Syria by the Byzantines&#x27; Mardaite allies compelled him to sign a peace treaty with Byzantium in 689 which substantially increased the Umayyads&#x27; annual tribute to the Empire. During his siege of Circesium in 691, Abd al-Malik reconciled with Zufar and the Qays by offering them privileged positions in the Umayyad court and army, signaling a new policy by the caliph and his successors to balance the interests of the Qays and Yaman in the Umayyad state. With his unified army, Abd al-Malik marched against the Zubayrids of Iraq, having already secretly secured the defection of the province&#x27;s leading tribal chiefs, and defeated Iraq&#x27;s ruler, Ibn al-Zubayr&#x27;s brother Mus&#x27;ab, at the Battle of Maskin in 691. Afterward, the Umayyad commander al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf besieged Mecca and killed Ibn al-Zubayr in 692, marking the end of the Second Fitna and the reunification of the caliphate under Abd al-Malik&#x27;s rule.

====Domestic consolidation and centralization====
Iraq remained politically unstable and the garrisons of Kufa and Basra had become exhausted by warfare with Kharijite rebels. In 694 Abd al-Malik combined both cities as a single province under the governorship of al-Hajjaj, who oversaw the suppression of the Kharijite revolts in Iraq and Iran by 698 and was subsequently given authority over the rest of the eastern caliphate. Resentment among the Iraqi troops towards al-Hajjaj&#x27;s methods of governance, particularly his death threats to force participation in the war efforts and his reductions to their stipends, culminated with a mass Iraqi rebellion against the Umayyads in . The leader of the rebels was the Kufan nobleman Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath, grandson of al-Ash&#x27;ath ibn Qays. Al-Hajjaj defeated Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath&#x27;s rebels at the Battle of Dayr al-Jamajim in April. The suppression of the revolt marked the end of the Iraqi &quot;muqātila&quot; as a military force and the beginning of Syrian military domination of Iraq. Iraqi internal divisions, and the utilization of more disciplined Syrian forces by Abd al-Malik and al-Hajjaj, voided the Iraqis&#x27; attempt to reassert power in the province.

To consolidate Umayyad rule after the Second Fitna, the Marwanids launched a series of centralization, Islamization and Arabization measures. To prevent further rebellions in Iraq, al-Hajjaj founded a permanent Syrian garrison in Wasit, situated between Kufa and Basra, and instituted a more rigorous administration in the province. Power thereafter derived from the Syrian troops, who became Iraq&#x27;s ruling class, while Iraq&#x27;s Arab nobility, religious scholars and &quot;mawālī&quot; became their virtual subjects. The surplus from the agriculturally rich Sawad lands was redirected from the &quot;muqātila&quot; to the caliphal treasury in Damascus to pay the Syrian troops in Iraq. The system of military pay established by Umar, which paid stipends to veterans of the earlier Muslim conquests and their descendants, was ended, salaries being restricted to those in active service. The old system was considered a handicap on Abd al-Malik&#x27;s executive authority and financial ability to reward loyalists in the army. Thus, a professional army was established during Abd al-Malik&#x27;s reign whose salaries derived from tax proceeds.

In 693, the Byzantine gold &quot;solidus&quot; was replaced in Syria and Egypt with the dinar. Initially, the new coinage contained depictions of the caliph as the spiritual leader of the Muslim community and its supreme military commander. This image proved no less acceptable to Muslim officialdom and was replaced in 696 or 697 with image-less coinage inscribed with Qur&#x27;anic quotes and other Muslim religious formulas. In 698/699, similar changes were made to the silver dirhams issued by the Muslims in the former Sasanian Persian lands of the eastern caliphate. Arabic replaced Persian as the language of the &quot;dīwān&quot; in Iraq in 697, Greek in the Syrian &quot;dīwān&quot; in 700, and Greek and Coptic in the Egyptian &quot;dīwān&quot; in 705/706. Arabic ultimately became the sole official language of the Umayyad state, but the transition in faraway provinces, such as Khurasan, did not occur until the 740s. Although the official language was changed, Greek and Persian-speaking bureaucrats who were versed in Arabic kept their posts. According to Gibb, the decrees were the &quot;first step towards the reorganization and unification of the diverse tax-systems in the provinces, and also a step towards a more definitely Muslim administration&quot;. Indeed, it formed an important part of the Islamization measures that lent the Umayyad Caliphate &quot;a more ideological and programmatic coloring it had previously lacked&quot;, according to Blankinship.

In 691/692, Abd al-Malik completed the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. It was possibly intended as a monument of victory over the Christians that would distinguish Islam&#x27;s uniqueness within the common Abrahamic setting of Jerusalem, home of the two older Abrahamic faiths, Judaism and Christianity. An alternative motive may have been to divert the religious focus of Muslims in the Umayyad realm from the Ka&#x27;aba in Zubayrid Mecca (683–692), where the Umayyads were routinely condemned during the Hajj. In Damascus, Abd al-Malik&#x27;s son and successor al-Walid I () confiscated the cathedral of St. John the Baptist and founded the Great Mosque in its place as a &quot;symbol of the political supremacy and moral prestige of Islam&quot;, according to historian Nikita Elisséeff. Noting al-Walid&#x27;s awareness of architecture&#x27;s propaganda value, historian Robert Hillenbrand calls the Damascus mosque a &quot;victory monument&quot; intended as a &quot;visible statement of Muslim supremacy and permanence&quot;.

====Renewal of conquests====

Under al-Walid I the Umayyad Caliphate reached its greatest territorial extent. The war with the Byzantines had resumed under his father after the civil war, with the Umayyads defeating the Byzantines at the Battle of Sebastopolis in 692. The Umayyads frequently raided Byzantine Anatolia and Armenia in the following years. By 705, Armenia was annexed by the caliphate along with the principalities of Caucasian Albania and Iberia, which collectively became the province of Arminiya. In 695–698 the commander Hassan ibn al-Nu&#x27;man al-Ghassani restored Umayyad control over Ifriqiya after defeating the Byzantines and Berbers there. Carthage was captured and destroyed in 698, signaling &quot;the final, irretrievable end of Roman power in Africa&quot;, according to Kennedy. Kairouan was firmly secured as a launchpad for later conquests, while the port town of Tunis was founded and equipped with an arsenal on Abd al-Malik&#x27;s orders to establish a strong Arab fleet. Hassan ibn al-Nu&#x27;man continued the campaign against the Berbers, defeating them and killing their leader, the warrior queen al-Kahina, between 698 and 703. His successor in Ifriqiya, Musa ibn Nusayr, subjugated the Berbers of the Hawwara, Zenata and Kutama confederations and advanced into the Maghreb (western North Africa), conquering Tangier and Sus in 708/709. Musa&#x27;s Berber &quot;mawla&quot;, Tariq ibn Ziyad, invaded the Visigothic Kingdom of Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula) in 711 and within five years most of Hispania was conquered.

Al-Hajjaj managed the eastern expansion from Iraq. His lieutenant governor of Khurasan, Qutayba ibn Muslim, launched numerous campaigns against Transoxiana (Central Asia), which had been a largely impenetrable region for earlier Muslim armies, between 705 and 715. Despite the distance from the Arab garrison towns of Khurasan, the unfavorable terrain and climate and his enemies&#x27; numerical superiority, Qutayba, through his persistent raids, gained the surrender of Bukhara in 706–709, Khwarazm and Samarkand in 711–712 and Farghana in 713. He established Arab garrisons and tax administrations in Samarkand and Bukhara and demolished their Zoroastrian fire temples. Both cities developed as future centers of Islamic and Arabic learning. Umayyad suzerainty was secured over the rest of conquered Transoxiana through tributary alliances with local rulers, whose power remained intact. From 708/709, al-Hajjaj&#x27;s kinsman Muhammad ibn al-Qasim conquered northwestern South Asia and established out of this new territory the province of Sind. The massive war spoils netted by the conquests of Transoxiana, Sind and Hispania were comparable to the amounts accrued in the early Muslim conquests during the reign of Caliph Umar.

Al-Walid I&#x27;s successor, his brother Sulayman (), continued his predecessors&#x27; militarist policies, but expansion mostly ground to a halt during his reign. The deaths of al-Hajjaj in 714 and Qutayba in 715 left the Arab armies in Transoxiana in disarray. For the next 25 years, no further eastward conquests were undertaken and the Arabs lost territory. The Tang Chinese defeated the Arabs at the Battle of Aksu in 717, forcing their withdrawal to Tashkent. Meanwhile, in 716, the governor of Khurasan, Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, attempted to conquer the principalities of Jurjan and Tabaristan along the southern Caspian coast. His Khurasani and Iraqi troops were reinforced by Syrians, marking their first deployment to Khurasan, but the Arabs&#x27; initial successes were reversed by the local Iranian coalition of Farrukhan the Great. Afterward, the Arabs withdrew in return for a tributary agreement.

On the Byzantine front, Sulayman took up his predecessor&#x27;s project to capture Constantinople with increased vigor. His brother Maslama besieged the Byzantine capital from the land, while Umar ibn Hubayra al-Fazari launched a naval campaign against the city. The Byzantines destroyed the Umayyad fleets and defeated Maslama&#x27;s army, prompting his withdrawal to Syria in 718. The massive losses incurred during the campaign led to a partial retrenchment of Umayyad forces from the captured Byzantine frontier districts, but already in 720, Umayyad raids against Byzantium recommenced. Nevertheless, the goal of conquering Constantinople was effectively abandoned, and the frontier between the two empires stabilized along the line of the Taurus and Anti-Taurus Mountains, over which both sides continued to launch regular raids and counter-raids during the next centuries.

====Caliphate of Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz====
Contrary to expectations of a son or brother succeeding him, Sulayman had nominated his cousin, Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz, as his successor and he took office in 717. After the Arabs&#x27; severe losses in the offensive against Constantinople, Umar drew down Arab forces on the caliphate&#x27;s war fronts, though Narbonne in modern France was conquered during his reign. To maintain stronger oversight in the provinces, Umar dismissed all his predecessors&#x27; governors, his new appointees being generally competent men he could control. To that end, the massive viceroyalty of Iraq and the east was broken up.

Umar&#x27;s most significant policy entailed fiscal reforms to equalize the status of the Arabs and &quot;mawali&quot;, thus remedying a long-standing issue which threatened the Muslim community. The jizya (poll tax) on the &quot;mawali&quot; was eliminated. Hitherto, the jizya, which was traditionally reserved for the non-Muslim majorities of the caliphate, continued to be imposed on non-Arab converts to Islam, while all Muslims who cultivated conquered lands were liable to pay the (land tax). Since avoidance of taxation incentivized both mass conversions to Islam and abandonment of land for migration to the garrison cities, it put a strain on tax revenues, especially in Egypt, Iraq and Khurasan. Thus, &quot;the Umayyad rulers had a vested interest in preventing the conquered peoples from accepting Islam or forcing them to continue paying those taxes from which they claimed exemption as Muslims&quot;, according to Hawting. To prevent a collapse in revenue, the converts&#x27; lands would become the property of their villages and remain liable for the full rate of the .

In tandem, Umar intensified the Islamization drive of his Marwanid predecessors, enacting measures to distinguish Muslims from non-Muslims and inaugurating Islamic iconoclasm. His position among the Umayyad caliphs is unusual, in that he became the only one to have been recognized in subsequent Islamic tradition as a genuine caliph (&quot;khalifa&quot;) and not merely as a worldly king (&quot;malik&quot;).

===Late Marwanid period===
After the death of Umar II, another son of Abd al-Malik, Yazid II () became caliph. Not long after his accession, another mass revolt against Umayyad rule was staged in Iraq, this time by the prominent statesman Yazid ibn al-Muhallab. The latter declared a holy war against the Umayyads, took control of Basra and Wasit and gained the support of the Kufan elite. The caliph&#x27;s Syrian army defeated the rebels and pursued and nearly eliminated the influential Muhallabids, marking the suppression of the last major Iraqi revolt against the Umayyads.

Yazid II reversed Umar II&#x27;s equalization reforms, reimposing the jizya on the , which sparked revolts in Khurasan in 721 or 722 that persisted for some twenty years and met strong resistance among the Berbers of Ifriqiya, where the Umayyad governor was assassinated by his discontented Berber guards. Warfare on the frontiers was also resumed, with renewed annual raids against the Byzantines and the Khazars in Transcaucasia.

====Caliphate of Hisham and end of expansion====
The final son of Abd al-Malik to become caliph was Hisham (), whose long and eventful reign was above all marked by the curtailment of military expansion. Hisham established his court at Resafa in northern Syria, which was closer to the Byzantine border than Damascus, and resumed hostilities against the Byzantines, which had lapsed following the failure of the last siege of Constantinople. The new campaigns resulted in a number of successful raids into Anatolia, but also in a major defeat (the Battle of Akroinon), and did not lead to any significant territorial expansion.

From the caliphate&#x27;s north-western African bases, a series of raids on coastal areas of the Visigothic Kingdom paved the way to the permanent occupation of most of Iberia by the Umayyads (starting in 711), and on into south-eastern Gaul (last stronghold at Narbonne in 759). Hisham&#x27;s reign witnessed the end of expansion in the west, following the defeat of the Arab army by the Franks at the Battle of Tours in 732. Arab expansion had already been limited following the Battle of Toulouse in 721. In 739 a major Berber Revolt broke out in North Africa, which was probably the largest military setback in the reign of Caliph Hisham. From it emerged some of the first Muslim states outside the caliphate. It is also regarded as the beginning of Moroccan independence, as Morocco would never again come under the rule of an eastern caliph or any other foreign power until the 20th century. It was followed by the collapse of Umayyad authority in al-Andalus. In India, the Umayyad armies were defeated by the south Indian Chalukya dynasty and by the north Indian Pratiharas, stagnating further eastward Arab expansion.

In the Caucasus, the confrontation with the Khazars peaked under Hisham: the Arabs established Derbent as a major military base and launched several invasions of the northern Caucasus, but failed to subdue the nomadic Khazars. The conflict was arduous and bloody, and the Arab army even suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Marj Ardabil in 730. Marwan ibn Muhammad, the future Marwan II, finally ended the war in 737 with a massive invasion that is reported to have reached as far as the Volga, but the Khazars remained unsubdued.

Hisham suffered still worse defeats in the east, where his armies attempted to subdue both Tokharistan, with its centre at Balkh, and Transoxiana, with its centre at Samarkand. Both areas had already been partially conquered but remained difficult to govern. Once again, a particular difficulty concerned the question of the conversion of non-Arabs, especially the Sogdians of Transoxiana. Following the Umayyad defeat in the &quot;Day of Thirst&quot; in 724, Ashras ibn &#x27;Abd Allah al-Sulami, governor of Khurasan, promised tax relief to those Sogdians who converted to Islam but went back on his offer when it proved too popular and threatened to reduce tax revenues.

Discontent among the Khorasani Arabs rose sharply after the losses suffered in the Battle of the Defile in 731. In 734, al-Harith ibn Surayj led a revolt that received broad backing from Arabs and natives alike, capturing Balkh but failing to take Merv. After this defeat, al-Harith&#x27;s movement seems to have been dissolved. The problem of the rights of non-Arab Muslims would continue to plague the Umayyads.

====Third Fitna====

Hisham was succeeded by Al-Walid II (743–744), the son of Yazid II. Al-Walid is reported to have been more interested in earthly pleasures than in religion, a reputation that may be confirmed by the decoration of the so-called &quot;desert palaces&quot; (including Qusayr Amra and Khirbat al-Mafjar) that have been attributed to him. He quickly attracted the enmity of many, both by executing a number of those who had opposed his accession and by persecuting the Qadariyya.

In 744, Yazid III, a son of al-Walid I, was proclaimed caliph in Damascus, and his army tracked down and killed al-Walid II. Yazid III has received a certain reputation for piety and may have been sympathetic to the Qadariyya. He died a mere six months into his reign.

Yazid had appointed his brother, Ibrahim, as his successor, but Marwan II (744–750), the grandson of Marwan I, led an army from the northern frontier and entered Damascus in December 744, where he was proclaimed caliph. Marwan immediately moved the capital north to Harran, in present-day Turkey. A rebellion soon broke out in Syria, perhaps due to resentment over the relocation of the capital, and in 746 Marwan razed the walls of Homs and Damascus in retaliation.

Marwan also faced significant opposition from Kharijites in Iraq and Iran, who put forth first Dahhak ibn Qays and then Abu Dulaf as rival caliphs. In 747, Marwan managed to reestablish control of Iraq, but by this time a more serious threat had arisen in Khorasan.

====Abbasid Revolution and fall====

The Hashimiyya movement (a sub-sect of the Kaysanites Shia), led by the Abbasid family, overthrew the Umayyad caliphate. The Abbasids were members of the Hashim clan, rivals of the Umayyads, but the word &quot;Hashimiyya&quot; seems to refer specifically to Abu Hashim, a grandson of Ali and son of Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya. According to certain traditions, Abu Hashim died in 717 in Humeima in the house of Muhammad ibn Ali, the head of the Abbasid family, and before dying named Muhammad ibn Ali as his successor. This tradition allowed the Abbasids to rally the supporters of the failed revolt of Mukhtar, who had represented themselves as the supporters of Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya.

Beginning around 719, Hashimiyya missions began to seek adherents in Khurasan. Their campaign was framed as one of proselytism (dawah). They sought support for a &quot;member of the family&quot; of Muhammad, without making explicit mention of the Abbasids. These missions met with success both among Arabs and non-Arabs (mawali), although the latter may have played a particularly important role in the growth of the movement.

Around 746, Abu Muslim assumed leadership of the Hashimiyya in Khurasan. In 747, he successfully initiated an open revolt against Umayyad rule, which was carried out under the sign of the black flag. He soon established control of Khurasan, expelling its Umayyad governor, Nasr ibn Sayyar, and dispatched an army westwards. Kufa fell to the Hashimiyya in 749, the last Umayyad stronghold in Iraq, Wasit, was placed under siege, and in November of the same year Abul Abbas as-Saffah was recognized as the new caliph in the mosque at Kufa. At this point Marwan mobilized his troops from Harran and advanced toward Iraq. In January 750 the two forces met in the Battle of the Zab, and the Umayyads were defeated. Damascus fell to the Abbasids in April, and in August, Marwan was killed in Egypt. Some Umayyads in Syria continued to resist the takeover. The Umayyad princes Abu Muhammad al-Sufyani, al-Abbas ibn Muhammad, and Hashim ibn Yazid launched revolts in Syria and the Islamic–Byzantine frontier around late 750, but they were defeated.

The victors desecrated the tombs of the Umayyads in Syria, sparing only that of Umar II, and most of the remaining members of the Umayyad family were tracked down and killed. When Abbasids declared amnesty for members of the Umayyad family, eighty gathered to receive pardons, and all were massacred. One grandson of Hisham, Abd al-Rahman I, survived, escaped across North Africa, and established an emirate in Moorish Iberia (Al-Andalus). In a claim unrecognized outside of al-Andalus, he maintained that the Umayyad Caliphate, the true, authentic caliphate, more legitimate than the Abbasids, was continued through him in Córdoba. It was to survive for centuries.

Some Umayyads also survived in Syria, and their descendants would once more attempt to restore their old regime during the Fourth Fitna. Two Umayyads, Abu al-Umaytir al-Sufyani and Maslama ibn Ya&#x27;qub, successively seized control of Damascus from 811 to 813, and declared themselves caliphs. However, their rebellions were suppressed.

Previté-Orton argues that the reason for the decline of the Umayyads was the rapid expansion of Islam. During the Umayyad period, mass conversions brought Persians, Berbers, Copts, and Aramaic to Islam. These &quot;mawalis&quot; (clients) were often better educated and more civilised than their Arab overlords. The new converts, on the basis of equality of all Muslims, transformed the political landscape. Previté-Orton also argues that the feud between Syria and Iraq further weakened the empire.

==Administration==
The first four caliphs created a stable administration for the empire, following the practices and administrative institutions of the Byzantine Empire which had ruled the same region previously. These consisted of four main governmental branches: political affairs, military affairs, tax collection, and religious administration. Each of these was further subdivided into more branches, offices, and departments.

===Provinces===
Geographically, the empire was divided into several provinces, the borders of which changed numerous times during the Umayyad reign. Each province had a governor appointed by the caliph. The governor was in charge of the religious officials, army leaders, police, and civil administrators in his province. Local expenses were paid for by taxes coming from that province, with the remainder each year being sent to the central government in Damascus. As the central power of the Umayyad rulers waned in the later years of the dynasty, some governors neglected to send the extra tax revenue to Damascus and created great personal fortunes.

===Government workers===
As the empire grew, the number of qualified Arab workers was too small to keep up with the rapid expansion of the empire. Therefore, Muawiya allowed many of the local government workers in conquered provinces to keep their jobs under the new Umayyad government. Thus, much of the local government&#x27;s work was recorded in Greek, Coptic, and Persian. It was only during the reign of Abd al-Malik that government work began to be regularly recorded in Arabic.

===Military===
The Umayyad army was mainly Arab, with its core consisting of those who had settled in urban Syria and the Arab tribes who originally served in the army of the Eastern Roman Empire in Syria. These were supported by tribes in the Syrian desert and in the frontier with the Byzantines, as well as Christian Syrian tribes. Soldiers were registered with the Army Ministry, the Diwan Al-Jaysh, and were salaried. The army was divided into junds based on regional fortified cities. The Umayyad Syrian forces specialised in close order infantry warfare, and favoured using a kneeling spear wall formation in battle, probably as a result of their encounters with Roman armies. This was radically different from the original Bedouin style of mobile and individualistic fighting.

===Coinage===
The Byzantine and Sassanid Empires relied on money economies before the Muslim conquest and that system remained in effect during the Umayyad period. Byzantine coinage was used until 658; Byzantine gold coins were still in use until the monetary reforms . In addition to this, the Umayyad government began to mint its own coins in Damascus, which were initially similar to pre-existing coins but evolved in an independent direction. These were the first coins minted by a Muslim government in history.

Early Islamic coins re-used Byzantine and Sasanian iconography directly but added new Islamic elements. So-called &quot;Arab-Byzantine&quot; coins replicated Byzantine coins and were minted in Levantine cities before and after the Umayyads rose to power. Some examples of these coins, likely minted in Damascus, copied the coins of Byzantine emperor Heraclius, including a depiction of the emperor and his son Heraclius Constantine. On the reverse side, the traditional Byzantine cross-on-steps image was modified to avoid any explicitly non-Islamic connotation.

In the 690s, under Abd al-Malik&#x27;s reign, a new period of experimentations began. Some &quot;Arab-Sasanian&quot; coins dated between 692 and 696, associated with the mints in Iraq under governor Bishr ibn Marwan, stopped using the Sasanian image of the fire altar and replaced it with three male figures standing in Arab dress. This was possibly an attempt to depict the act of Muslim prayer or the delivery of the &quot;khutba&quot; (Friday sermon). Another coin minted probably between 695 and 698 features the image of a spear under an arch. This has been variously interpreted as representing a &quot;mihrab&quot; or a &quot;sacral arch&quot;, the latter being a late antique motif. The spear is believed to be the spear (&quot;&#x27;anaza&quot;) that Muhammad carried before him when entering the mosque.

Between 696 and 699, the caliph introduced a new system of coinage of gold, silver, and bronze. The coins generally featured Arabic inscriptions without any images, ending the earlier iconographic traditions. The main gold unit was the &quot;dinar&quot; (from Roman &quot;denarius&quot;), which was worth 20 silver coins. It was most likely modeled on the Byzantine &quot;solidus&quot;. The silver coin was called a &quot;dirham&quot; (from Greek &quot;drachma&quot;). Its size and shape was based on Sasanian coins and they were minted in much larger quantities than in the earlier Byzantine era. The bronze coin was called a &quot;fals&quot; or &quot;fulus&quot; (from Byzantine &quot;follis&quot;).

One group of bronze coins from Palestine, dated after the coinage reform of the late 690s, features the image of a seven-branched menorah and then later of a five-branched menorah, topped by an Arabic inscription of the &quot;shahada&quot;. These images may have been based on Christian representations of the menorah or on earlier Hasmonean models. The switch to a five-branched version may have been intended to further differentiate this depiction from Jewish and Christian versions.

===Central diwans===

To assist the caliph in administration there were six boards at the centre: Diwan al-Kharaj (the Board of Revenue), Diwan al-Rasa&#x27;il (the Board of Correspondence), Diwan al-Khatam (the Board of Signet), Diwan al-Barid (the Board of Posts), Diwan al-Qudat (the Board of Justice) and Diwan al-Jund (the Military Board).

====Diwan al-Kharaj====
The Central Board of Revenue administered the entire finances of the empire. It also imposed and collected taxes and disbursed revenue.

====Diwan al-Rasa&#x27;il====
A regular Board of Correspondence was established under the Umayyads. It issued state missives and circulars to the Central and Provincial Officers. It coordinated the work of all Boards and dealt with all correspondence as the chief secretariat.

====Diwan al-Khatam====
In order to reduce forgery, Diwan al-Khatam (Bureau of Registry), a kind of state chancellery, was instituted by Mu&#x27;awiyah. It used to make and preserve a copy of each official document before sealing and despatching the original to its destination. Thus in the course of time a state archive developed in Damascus by the Umayyads under Abd al-Malik. This department survived till the middle of the Abbasid period.

====Diwan al-Barid====
Mu&#x27;awiyah introduced the postal service, Abd al-Malik extended it throughout his empire, and Walid made full use of it. Umar bin Abdul-Aziz developed it further by building caravanserais at stages along the Khurasan highway. Relays of horses were used for the conveyance of dispatches between the caliph and his agents and officials posted in the provinces. The main highways were divided into stages of each and each stage had horses, donkeys, or camels ready to carry the post. Primarily the service met the needs of government officials, but travellers and their important dispatches were also benefited by the system. The postal carriages were also used for the swift transport of troops. They were able to carry fifty to a hundred men at a time. Under governor Yusuf ibn Umar al-Thaqafi, the postal department of Iraq cost 4,000,000 dirhams a year.

====Diwan al-Qudat====
In the early period of Islam, justice was administered by Muhammad and the orthodox caliphs in person. After the expansion of the Islamic State, Umar al-Faruq had to separate the judiciary from the general administration and appointed the first &quot;qadi&quot; in Egypt as early as AD 643/23 AH. After 661, a series of judges served in Egypt during the caliphates of Hisham and Walid II.

====Diwan al-Jund====
The Diwan of Umar, assigning annuities to all Arabs and to the Muslim soldiers of other races, underwent a change in the hands of the Umayyads. The Umayyads meddled with the register and the recipients regarded pensions as the subsistence allowance even without being in active service. Hisham reformed it and paid only to those who participated in the battle.
On the pattern of the Byzantine system, the Umayyads reformed their army organization in general and divided it into five corps: the centre, two wings, vanguards, and rearguards, following the same formation while on the march or on a battlefield. Marwan II (740–50) abandoned the old division and introduced the Kurdus (cohort), a small compact body.
The Umayyad troops were divided into three divisions: infantry, cavalry, and artillery. Arab troops were dressed and armed in Greek fashion. The Umayyad cavalry used plain and round saddles. The artillery used the arradah (ballista), the manjaniq (mangonel), and the dabbabah or kabsh (battering ram). The heavy engines, siege machines, and baggage were carried on camels behind the army.

==Social organization==
The Umayyad Caliphate had four main social classes:
# Muslim Arabs
# Muslim non-Arabs (clients of the Muslim Arabs)
# Dhimmis (non-Muslim free persons such as Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians)
# Slaves

The Muslim Arabs were at the top of the society and saw it as their duty to rule over the conquered areas. The Arab Muslims held themselves in higher esteem than Muslim non-Arabs and generally did not mix with other Muslims.

As Islam spread, more and more of the Muslim population consisted of non-Arabs. This caused social unrest, as the new converts were not given the same rights as Muslim Arabs. Also, as conversions increased, tax revenues (peasant tax) from non-Muslims decreased to dangerous lows. These issues continued to worsen until they helped cause the Abbasid Revolt in the 740s.

===Non-Muslims===
Non-Muslim groups in the Umayyad Caliphate, which included Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, and pagans, were called dhimmis. They were given a legally protected status as second-class citizens as long as they accepted and acknowledged the political supremacy of the ruling Muslims. More specifically, non-Muslims had to pay a tax, known as jizya, which the Muslims did not have to pay; Muslims would instead pay the zakat tax. If non-Muslims converted to Islam, they would cease paying jizya and would instead pay zakat.

Although the Umayyads were harsh when it came to defeating their Zoroastrian adversaries, they did offer protection and relative religious tolerance to the Zoroastrians who accepted their authority. As a matter of fact, Umar II was reported to have said in one of his letters commanding not to &quot;destroy a synagogue or a church or temple of fire worshippers (meaning the Zoroastrians) as long as they have reconciled with and agreed upon with the Muslims&quot;. Fred Donner says that Zoroastrians in the northern parts of Iran were hardly penetrated by the &quot;believers&quot;, winning virtually complete autonomy in-return for tribute-tax or jizyah. Donner adds &quot;Zoroastrians continued to exist in large numbers in northern and western Iran and elsewhere for centuries after the rise of Islam, and indeed, much of the canon of Zoroastrian religious texts was elaborated and written down during the Islamic period.&quot;

Christians and Jews still continued to produce great theological thinkers within their communities, but as time wore on, many of the intellectuals converted to Islam, leading to a lack of great thinkers in the non-Muslim communities. Important Christian writers from the Umayyad period include the theologian John of Damascus, bishop Cosmas of Maiuma, Pope Benjamin I of Alexandria and Isaac of Nineveh.

Although non-Muslims could not hold the highest public offices in the empire, they held many bureaucratic positions within the government. An important example of Christian employment in the Umayyad government is that of Sarjun ibn Mansur. He was a Melkite Christian official of the early Umayyad Caliphate. The son of a prominent Byzantine official of Damascus, he was a favourite of the early Umayyad caliphs Mu&#x27;awiya I and Yazid I, and served as the head of the fiscal administration for Syria from the mid-7th century until the year 700, when Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan dismissed him as part of his efforts to Arabicize the administration of the caliphate. According to the Muslim historians al-Baladhuri and al-Tabari, Sarjun was a &quot;mawla&quot; of the first Umayyad caliph, Mu&#x27;awiya I (), serving as his &quot;secretary and the person in charge of his business&quot;. The hagiographies, although less reliable, also assign to him a role in the administration, even as &quot;ruler&quot; (&quot;archon&quot; or even &quot;amir&quot;), of Damascus and its environs, where he was responsible for collecting the revenue. In this capacity, he is attested in later collections of source material such as that of al-Mas&#x27;udi. Sarjun ibn Mansur was replaced by Sulayman ibn Sa&#x27;d al-Khushani, another Christian.

Muawiya&#x27;s marriage to Maysun bint Bahdal (Yazid&#x27;s mother) was politically motivated, as she was the daughter of the chief of the Kalb tribe, which was a large Syriac Orthodox Christian Arab tribe in Syria. The Kalb tribe had remained largely neutral when the Muslims first went into Syria. After the plague that killed much of the Muslim army in Syria, by marrying Maysun, Muawiyah used the Syriac Orthodox Christians against the Byzantines.

Tom Holland writes that Christians, Jews, Samaritans and Manichaeans were all treated well by Muawiyah. Muawiyah even restored Edessa&#x27;s cathedral after it had been toppled by an earthquake. Holland also writes that, &quot;Savagely though Muawiyah prosecuted his wars against the Romans, yet his subjects, no longer trampled by rival armies, no longer divided by hostile watchtowers, knew only peace at last. Justice flourished in his time, and there was great peace in the regions under his control. He allowed everyone to live as they wanted.&quot;

== Architecture ==
The Umayyads constructed grand congregational mosques and palaces within their empire. Most of their surviving monuments are located in the Levant region, their main base of power. They also continued the existing Muslim policy of building new garrison cities (&quot;amsar&quot;) in their provinces that served as bases for further expansion. Their most famous constructions include the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem and the Great Mosque of Damascus, while other constructions include the so-called desert palaces, such as Khirbat al-Majfar and Qusayr &#x27;Amra. Among these projects, the construction of the Great Mosque in Damascus reflected the diversity of the empire, as Greek, Persian, Coptic, Indian and Maghrebi craftsmen were recruited to build it.

Under Umayyad patronage, Islamic architecture was derived from established Byzantine and Sasanian architectural traditions, but it also innovated by combining elements of these styles together, experimenting with new building types, and implementing lavish decorative programs. Byzantine-style mosaics are prominently featured in both the Dome of the Rock and the Great Mosque of Damascus, but the lack of human figures in their imagery was a new trait that demonstrates an Islamic taboo on figural representation in religious art. Palaces were decorated with floor mosaics, frescoes, and relief carving, and some of these included representations of human figures and animals. Umayyad architecture was thus an important transitional period during which early Islamic architecture and visual culture began to develop its own distinct identity.

The later offshoot of the Umayyad dynasty in al-Andalus, which ruled the Emirate and subsequent Caliphate of Córdoba, also undertook major architectural projects in the Iberian Peninsula such as the Great Mosque of Córdoba and Madinat al-Zahra, which influenced later architecture in the western Islamic world.

==Legacy==


The Umayyad caliphate was marked both by territorial expansion and by the administrative and cultural problems that such expansion created. Despite some notable exceptions, the Umayyads tended to favor the rights of the old Arab families, and in particular their own, over those of newly converted Muslims (mawali). Therefore, they held to a less universalist conception of Islam than did many of their rivals. As G.R. Hawting has written, &quot;Islam was in fact regarded as the property of the conquering aristocracy.&quot;

During the period of the Umayyads, Arabic became the administrative language and the process of Arabization was initiated in the Levant, Mesopotamia, North Africa, and Iberia. State documents and currency were issued in Arabic. Mass conversions also created a growing population of Muslims in the territory of the caliphate.

According to one common view, the Umayyads transformed the caliphate from a religious institution (during the Rashidun caliphate) to a dynastic one. However, the Umayyad caliphs do seem to have understood themselves as the representatives of God on earth, and to have been responsible for the &quot;definition and elaboration of God&#x27;s ordinances, or in other words the definition or elaboration of Islamic law.&quot;

The Umayyads have met with a largely negative reception from later Islamic historians, who have accused them of promoting a kingship (&quot;mulk&quot;, a term with connotations of tyranny) instead of a true caliphate (&quot;khilafa&quot;). In this respect it is notable that the Umayyad caliphs referred to themselves not as &quot;khalifat rasul Allah&quot; (&quot;successor of the messenger of God&quot;, the title preferred by the tradition), but rather as &quot;khalifat Allah&quot; (&quot;deputy of God&quot;). The distinction seems to indicate that the Umayyads &quot;regarded themselves as God&#x27;s representatives at the head of the community and saw no need to share their religious power with, or delegate it to, the emergent class of religious scholars.&quot; In fact, it was precisely this class of scholars, based largely in Iraq, that was responsible for collecting and recording the traditions that form the primary source material for the history of the Umayyad period. In reconstructing this history, therefore, it is necessary to rely mainly on sources, such as the histories of Tabari and Baladhuri, that were written in the Abbasid court at Baghdad.

The book &quot;Al Muwatta&quot;, by Imam Malik, was written in the early Abbasid period in Medina. It does not contain any anti-Umayyad content because it was more concerned with what the Quran and what Muhammad said and was not a history book on the Umayyads. Even the earliest pro-Shia accounts of al-Masudi are more balanced. Al-Masudi&#x27;s &quot;Ibn Hisham&quot; is the earliest Shia account of Muawiyah. He recounted that Muawiyah spent a great deal of time in prayer, in spite of the burden of managing a large empire. After killing off most of the Umayyads and destroying the graves of the Umayyad rulers apart from Muawiyah and Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz, the history books were written during the later Abbasid period are more anti-Umayyad. The books written later in the Abbasid period in Iran are more anti-Umayyad. Iran was Sunni at the time. There was much anti-Arab feeling in Iran after the fall of the Persian empire.

Modern Arab nationalism regards the period of the Umayyads as part of the Arab Golden Age which it sought to emulate and restore.
This is particularly true of Syrian nationalists and the present-day state of Syria, centered like that of the Umayyads on Damascus. The Umayyad banners were white, after the banner of Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan; it is now one of the four Pan-Arab colours which appear in various combinations on the flags of most Arab countries.

===Religious perspectives===
====Sunni====
Many Muslims criticized the Umayyads for having too many non-Muslim, former Roman administrators in their government, &quot;e.g.&quot;, St. John of Damascus. As the Muslims took over cities, they left the people&#x27;s political representatives, the Roman tax collectors, and the administrators in the office. The taxes to the central government were calculated and negotiated by the people&#x27;s political representatives. Both the central and local governments were compensated for the services each provided. Many Christian cities used some of the taxes to maintain their churches and run their own organizations. Later, the Umayyads were criticized by some Muslims for not reducing the taxes of the people who converted to Islam.

Later, when Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz came to power, he reduced these taxes. He is therefore praised as one of the greatest Muslim rulers after the four Rightly Guided Caliphs. Imam Abu Muhammad Abdullah ibn Abdul Hakam (who lived in 829 and wrote a biography on Umar Ibn Abdul Aziz) stated that the reduction in these taxes stimulated the economy and created wealth but it also reduced the government&#x27;s budget, including, eventually, the defence budget.

The only Umayyad ruler who is unanimously praised by Sunni sources for his devout piety and justice is Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz. In his efforts to spread Islam, he established liberties for the &quot;Mawali&quot; by abolishing the jizya tax for converts to Islam. Imam Abu Muhammad Abdullah ibn Abdul Hakam stated that Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz also stopped the personal allowance offered to his relatives, stating that he could only give them an allowance if he gave an allowance to everyone else in the empire. After Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz was poisoned in 720, successive governments tried to reverse Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz&#x27;s tax policies, but rebellion resulted.

====Shi&#x27;a====
The negative view of the Umayyads held by Shias is briefly expressed in the Shi&#x27;a book &quot;Sulh al-Hasan&quot;. According to Shia hadiths, which are not considered authentic by Sunnis, Ali described them as the worst Fitna. In Shia sources, the Umayyad Caliphate is widely described as &quot;tyrannical, anti-Islamic and godless&quot;. Shias point out that the founder of the dynasty, Muawiyah, declared himself a caliph in 657 and went to war against Muhammad&#x27;s son-in-law and cousin, the ruling caliph Ali, clashing at the Battle of Siffin. Muawiyah also declared his son, Yazid, as his successor in breach of a treaty with Hassan, Muhammad&#x27;s grandson. Another of Muhammad&#x27;s grandsons, Husayn ibn Ali, would be killed by Yazid in the Battle of Karbala. Further Shia Imams, Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin would be killed at the hands of ruling Umayyad caliphs.

====Bahá&#x27;í====
Asked for an explanation of the prophecies in the Book of Revelation (12:3), `Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá suggests in Some Answered Questions that the &quot;great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads&quot;, refers to the Umayyad caliphs who &quot;rose against the religion of Prophet Muhammad and against the reality of Ali&quot;.

The seven heads of the dragon are symbolic of the seven provinces of the lands dominated by the Umayyads: Damascus, Persia, Arabia, Egypt, Africa, Andalusia, and Transoxiana. The ten horns represent the ten names of the leaders of the Umayyad dynasty: Abu Sufyan, Muawiya, Yazid, Marwan, Abd al-Malik, Walid, Sulayman, Umar, Hisham, and Ibrahim. Some names were re-used, as in the case of Yazid II and Yazid III, which were not accounted for in this interpretation.

<text>The Abbasid Caliphate or Abbasid Empire (; ) was the third caliphate to succeed the Islamic prophet Muhammad. It was founded by a dynasty descended from Muhammad&#x27;s uncle, Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib (566–653 CE), from whom the dynasty takes its name. They ruled as caliphs for most of the caliphate from their capital in Baghdad in modern-day Iraq, after having overthrown the Umayyad Caliphate in the Abbasid Revolution of 750 CE (132 AH). The Abbasid Revolution had its origins and first successes in the easterly region of Khorasan, far from the Levantine center of Umayyad influence.

The Abbasid Caliphate first centered its government in Kufa, modern-day Iraq, but in 762 the caliph al-Mansur founded the city of Baghdad, near the ancient Babylonian capital city of Babylon and Sassanid city of Ctesiphon. Baghdad became the center of science, culture, and invention in what became known as the Golden Age of Islam. It was also during this period that Islamic manuscript production reached its height. Between the 8th and 10th centuries, Abbasid artisans pioneered and perfected manuscript techniques that became standards of the practice. This, in addition to housing several key academic institutions, including the House of Wisdom, as well as a multiethnic and multi-religious environment, garnered it an international reputation as a centre of learning. The Abbasid period was marked by the use of bureaucrats (such as the Barmakid family) for governing the territories as well as an increasing inclusion of non-Arab Muslims in the &quot;ummah&quot; (Muslim community). Despite this initial cooperation, the Abbasids of the late 8th century had alienated both non-Arab &quot;mawali&quot; (clients).

The political power of the caliphs was limited with the rise of the Iranian Buyids and the Seljuq Turks, who captured Baghdad in 945 and 1055, respectively. Although Abbasid leadership over the vast Islamic empire was gradually reduced to a ceremonial religious function in much of the caliphate, the dynasty retained control of its Mesopotamian domain during the rule of Caliph al-Muqtafi and extended into Iran during the reign of Caliph al-Nasir. The Abbasids&#x27; age of cultural revival and fruition ended in 1258 with the siege of Baghdad by the Mongols under Hulagu Khan and the execution of al-Musta&#x27;sim. The Abbasid line of rulers re-centred themselves in the Mamluk capital of Cairo in 1261. Though lacking in political power, with the brief exception of Caliph al-Musta&#x27;in, the dynasty continued to claim religious authority until a few years after the Ottoman conquest of Egypt in 1517, with the last Abbasid caliph being al-Mutawakkil III.

==History==
The Abbasid caliphs were descended from Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib, one of the youngest uncles of Muhammad and of the same Banu Hashim clan. The Abbasids claimed to be the true successors of Muhammad in replacing the Umayyad descendants of Banu Umayya by virtue of their closer bloodline to Muhammad.

===Abbasid Revolution (750–751)===

The Abbasids also distinguished themselves from the Umayyads by attacking their moral character and administration in general. According to Ira Lapidus, &quot;The Abbasid revolt was supported largely by Arabs, mainly the aggrieved settlers of Merv with the addition of the Yemeni faction and their Mawali&quot;. The Abbasids also appealed to non-Arab Muslims, known as &quot;mawali&quot;, who remained outside the kinship-based society of the Arabs and were perceived as a lower class within the Umayyad empire. Muhammad ibn &#x27;Ali, a great-grandson of Abbas, began to campaign in Persia for the return of power to the family of Muhammad, the Hashemites, during the reign of Umar II.

During the reign of Marwan II, this opposition culminated in the rebellion of Ibrahim al-Imam, the fourth in descent from Abbas. Supported by the province of Khorasan (Eastern Persia), even though the governor opposed them, and the Shia Arabs, he achieved considerable success, but was captured in the year 747 and died, possibly assassinated, in prison.

On 9 June 747 (15 Ramadan AH 129), Abu Muslim, rising from Khorasan, successfully initiated an open revolt against Umayyad rule, which was carried out under the sign of the Black Standard. Close to 10,000 soldiers were under Abu Muslim&#x27;s command when the hostilities officially began in Merv. General Qahtaba followed the fleeing governor Nasr ibn Sayyar west defeating the Umayyads at the Battle of Gorgan, the Battle of Nahavand and finally in the Battle of Karbala, all in the year 748.

Ibrahim was captured by Marwan and was killed. The quarrel was taken up by Ibrahim&#x27;s brother Abdallah, known by the name of Abu al-&#x27;Abbas as-Saffah, who defeated the Umayyads in 750 in the battle near the Great Zab and was subsequently proclaimed caliph. After this loss, Marwan fled to Egypt, where he was subsequently killed. The remainder of his family, barring one male, were also eliminated.

===Rise to power (752–775)===

Immediately after their victory, al-Saffah sent his forces to Central Asia, where his forces fought against Tang expansion during the Battle of Talas. Al-Saffah focused on putting down numerous rebellions in Syria and Mesopotamia. The Byzantines conducted raids during these early distractions.

One of the first major changes effected by Abbasid rule was the move of the caliphate&#x27;s center of power from Syria to Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq). This was closer to the Persian &quot;mawali&quot; support base of the Abbasids and the move addressed their demand for reduced Arab dominance in the empire. However, no definitive capital was yet selected. In these early Abbasid years, Kufa generally served as the administrative capital, but the caliphs were wary of the Alid sympathies in the city and did not always reside here. In 752, al-Saffah built a new city called al-Hashimiyya, at an uncertain location, most likely near Kufa. Later that same year, he moved to Anbar, where he built a new settlement for his Khurasani soldiers and a palace for himself.
It was al-Saffah&#x27;s successor, Abu Ja&#x27;far al-Mansur () who firmly consolidated Abbasid rule and faced down internal challenges. His uncle, Abdallah ibn Ali, the victor over the Umayyads at the Battle of the Zab, was the most serious potential rival for leadership and al-Mansur sent Abu Muslim, the Khurasani revolutionary commander, against him in 754. After Abu Muslim successfully defeated him, al-Mansur then turned to eliminate Abu Muslim himself. He arranged to have him arrested and executed in 755.

On the western frontier, the Abbasids were unable to re-assert caliphal control over the western and central Maghreb, which the Umayyads had lost in the 740s. One member of the Umayyad dynasty, Abd ar-Rahman, also managed to escape the purge of his family and established independent in rule in al-Andalus (present-day Spain and Portugal) in 756, founding the Umayyad Emirate of Córdoba.

In 756, al-Mansur had also sent over 4,000 Arab mercenaries to assist the Chinese Tang dynasty in the An Lushan Rebellion against An Lushan. The Abbasids, or &quot;Black Flags&quot; as they were commonly called, were known in Tang dynasty chronicles as the &quot;hēiyī Dàshí&quot;, &quot;The Black-robed Tazi&quot; () (&quot;Tazi&quot; being a borrowing from Persian &quot;&quot;, the word for &quot;Arab&quot;). Al-Rashid sent embassies to the Chinese Tang dynasty and established good relations with them. After the war, these embassies remained in China with Caliph Harun al-Rashid establishing an alliance with China. Several embassies from the Abbasid Caliphs to the Chinese court have been recorded in the &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot;, the most important being those of al-Saffah, al-Mansur, and Harun al-Rashid.
In 762, al-Mansur suppressed a rebellion in the Hejaz led by al-Nafs al-Zakiyya, a descendant from Ali ibn Abi Talib, whose challenge to the Abbasid claim to leadership was based on his Alid lineage and thus presented a serious political threat. He was defeated by an Abbasid army led by Isa ibn Musa. It was after this victory, in 762, that al-Mansur finally established a proper Abbasid capital, Baghdad – officially called &quot;Madinat al-Salam&quot; (&#x27;City of Peace&#x27;) – located on the Tigris River. Prior to this, he had continued to consider multiple sites for a capital, including al-Hashimiyya, which he used as a capital for a while, and al-Rumiyya (near the ruins of Ctesiphon), which he used for a few months. Various other sites in the region also appear to have served as &quot;capitals&quot; under either al-Saffah or al-Mansur prior to the founding of Baghdad.

Al-Mansur centralised the judicial administration, and later, Harun al-Rashid established the institution of Chief Qadi to oversee it. The Umayyad empire was mostly Arab; however, the Abbasids progressively became made up of more and more converted Muslims in which the Arabs were only one of many ethnicities. The Abbasids had depended heavily on the support of Persians in their overthrow of the Umayyads. Al-Mansur welcomed non-Arab Muslims to his court. While this helped integrate Arab and Persian cultures, it alienated many of their Arab supporters, particularly the Khorasanian Arabs who had supported them in their battles against the Umayyads.

===Golden age (775–861)===
The Abbasid leadership had to work hard in the last half of the 8th century (750–800) under several competent caliphs and their viziers to usher in the administrative changes needed to keep order of the political challenges created by the far-flung nature of the empire, and the limited communication across it. It was also during this early period of the dynasty, in particular during the governance of Al-Mansur, Harun al-Rashid, and al-Ma&#x27;mun, that its reputation and power were created.
The position of &quot;wazir&quot; (vizier) developed in this period. It was initially akin to a secretary, but under the tenure of the Barmakids, an Iranian family close to the Abbasids, the position became powerful and Harun al-Rashid delegated state affairs to them for many years. This resulted in a more ceremonial role for many Abbasid caliphs relative to their time under the Umayyads; the viziers began to exert greater influence, and the role of the Caliph&#x27;s aristocracy was slowly replaced by a Baramkid bureaucracy. To the west, Harun al-Rashid agreed to grant the province of Ifriqiya (centered in present-day Tunisia) as a hereditary emirate to Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab, who founded the Aghlabid dynasty there.

Al-Mahdi restarted the fighting with the Byzantines, and his sons continued the conflict until Empress Irene pushed for peace. After several years of peace, Nikephoros I broke the treaty, then fended off multiple incursions during the first decade of the 9th century. These attacks pushed into the Taurus Mountains, culminating with a victory at the Battle of Krasos and the massive invasion of 806, led by Rashid himself.

Harun al-Rashid&#x27;s navy also proved successful, taking Cyprus. Rashid decided to focus on the rebellion of Rafi ibn al-Layth in Khorasan and died while there. Military operations by the caliphate were minimal while the Byzantine Empire was fighting Abbasid rule in Syria and Anatolia, with focus shifting primarily to internal matters; Abbasid governors exerted greater autonomy and, using this increasing power, began to make their positions hereditary.
While Baghdad remained the official capital, Harun al-Rashid chose to reside in Raqqa from 796 until the end of his reign. In 803, for reasons that remain unclear, he turned on and imprisoned or killed most of the Barmakids, who had wielded administrative power on his behalf. 

Domestically, al-Rashid pursued policies similar to those of his father al-Mahdi. He released many of the Umayyads and &#x27;Alids his brother al-Hadi had imprisoned and declared amnesty for all political groups of the Quraysh. Large scale hostilities broke out with Byzantium and, under his rule, the Abbasid Empire reached its peak. However, his decision to split the succession proved to be damaging to the longevity of the empire.
After his death, the empire was split by a civil war between the caliph al-Amin and his brother al-Ma&#x27;mun, who had the support of Khorasan. This war ended with a two-year siege of Baghdad and the eventual death of Al-Amin in 813. Al-Ma&#x27;mun ruled for 20 years of relative calm interspersed with a rebellion in Azerbaijan by the Khurramites, which was supported by the Byzantines. He was responsible for the creation of an autonomous Khorasan and the continued repulsing of Byzantine forays.

Al-Ma&#x27;mun was also known for his intellectual interests and patronage. The so-called &quot;translation movement&quot; — the state-sponsored translation of scientific and literary works of antiquity into Arabic — that had begun under his predecessors was pushed even further during his reign, though its focus shifted to ancient Greek works of science and philosophy. In matters of religion, al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s interest in philosophy spurred him to endorse Mu&#x27;tazilism, the rationalist school of Islamic thought. Under its influence, he officially endorsed the doctrine of createdness of the Qur&#x27;an in 827. In 833, he went further and forcibly imposed it on the &quot;ulama&quot;, the Sunni religious scholars. This controversial policy, known as the &quot;Mihna&quot;, was eventually abandoned in 848. Ultimately, it failed to convince the Sunni &quot;ulama&quot; and instead contributed to the emergence of the latter as a more cohesive social class whose views and interests did not always align with the caliph.

Following the civil war between al-Amin and al-Ma&#x27;mun, the traditional mainstay of the Abbasid army, the &quot;Khurasaniyya&quot; and &quot;&#x27;Abna al-dawla&quot;, were no longer seen as reliable and the caliphs sought to recruit a new type of army whose loyalty could be better assured. This process began under al-Ma&#x27;mun but it is his brother and successor, al-Mu&#x27;tasim (), who is known for its more radical implementation. Soldiers were recruited from several new sources, but the most important, especially under al-Mu&#x27;tasim, were the group referred to by Arabic chronicles as &quot;Turks&quot; (), who appear to have been mainly Turkic people from Central Asia. Some modern scholars refer to them as Mamluks, marking them as the antecedent of the later slave-soldiers known by that term, but their exact legal status has been a subject of scholarly debate. Many, perhaps the majority, were originally purchased or captured slaves, but they were paid regular salaries and thus likely manumitted. In any case, these outsiders did not have political ties among the traditional elites and thus their loyalty was to the caliph alone.

These troops were likely the first standing army of the caliphate and provided the caliph with a strong base of military support. However, the influx of new foreign troops into the capital created tensions with its inhabitants and with older elites. This was one of the main reasons why, in 836, al-Mu&#x27;tasim decided to found a new capital, Samarra, on an open site to the north of Baghdad. The new capital housed the caliph&#x27;s army, allowed for the unhindered construction of massive new palaces, and became the focus of an even more elaborate courtly culture.

Al-Mu&#x27;tasim&#x27;s reign marked the end of the strong caliphs. He strengthened his personal army with the Mamluks and promptly restarted the war with the Byzantines. Though his attempt to seize Constantinople failed when his fleet was destroyed by a storm, his military excursions were generally successful, culminating with a resounding victory in the Sack of Amorium. The Byzantines responded by sacking Damietta in Egypt, and Al-Mutawakkil responded by sending his troops into Anatolia again, sacking and marauding until they were eventually annihilated in 863.

===Political fragmentation (861–945)===
From the ninth century onward, the Abbasids found they could no longer keep together a centralized polity from Baghdad, which had grown larger than that of Rome. As mentioned, Harun al-Rashid had already granted the province of Ifriqiya to the Aghlabids, who ruled this region as an autonomous vassal state until its fall to the Fatimids in 909. In al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s reign, Tahir ibn Husayn (al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s general in the civil war) was appointed viceroy of Iran and most of the eastern regions of the empire from 821 onward. His descendants, the Tahirids, continued to govern in this position with significant autonomy until 873, although they remained loyal to the caliph and used only the title of &quot;amir&quot;. From their capital at Nishapur, they were important patrons of Arabic literature and Sunni religious scholarship, in addition to making major improvements to agriculture. In Transoxiana, the Persian Samanids of Bukhara and Samarkand ruled as local governors, initially under the Tahirids. They oversaw the development of the region&#x27;s cities into major trade centers, profiting from long-distance trade between China, Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East.
The reign of al-Mutawakkil () was characterized by the caliph&#x27;s extravagant spending, combined with his weakening support among the military. In 861, he was murdered at a party by a group of Turkish soldiers. This was the first time the Abbasid military intervened so directly and violently at court and it set a precedent for further coups in the years to come.

The following period, sometimes known as the &quot;Anarchy at Samarra&quot; (861–870), saw four different caliphs come and go. While they each attempted to reassert their authority, they were at the mercy of military and political factions. Tax collection lapsed and, along with al-Mutawakkil&#x27;s previous spending, this left the state short on funds, which exacerbated the infighting. In 865, the Turkish soldiers of Samarra even besieged Baghdad to overthrow the caliph al-Musta&#x27;in and, when the city fell the following year, they replaced him with al-Mu&#x27;tazz. The latter was overthrown by the same faction in 869 and replaced by al-Muhtadi, who was similarly overthrown in 870. Al-Muhtadi was succeeded by al-Mu&#x27;tamid, who was finally able to restore some order, in large part thanks to the help of his brother al-Muwaffaq, who kept the military under control and ran most government affairs. The restoration was hampered by the Zanj rebellion, which erupted in 869 and threatened the center of Abbasid control in Iraq. This major threat was not brought under control until a determined campaign was launched in 879.

By the 870s, Egypt became autonomous under Ahmad ibn Tulun and his Tulunid successors, though they continued to acknowledge the caliph and generally sent tribute to Baghdad. For a time, they even controlled Syria and parts of the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia). In 882, the caliph al-Mu&#x27;tamid even tried (but failed) to move his residence to Egypt at Ibn Tulun&#x27;s invitation. In the east, the Saffarids were former soldiers in the Abbasid army who were stationed in Sistan and remained there as local strongmen. From 854 onward, they began to challenge the Tahirids and in 873 they captured Nishapur, ending Tahirid rule. They marched on Baghdad in 876 but were defeated by al-Muwaffaq. The two sides were forced to come to terms and the Abbasids allowed the Saffarids to rule over Sistan, Fars, Kirman, and Khurasan. In 898, al-Mu&#x27;tadid set the Saffarids and Samanids against each other but the latter came out triumphant in battle and were able to expand their control to Khurasan, while the Saffarids remained further south. The Samanids never threatened the Abbasids in Iraq, but they were also not as close to the caliphs as their Tahirid predecessors and in practice they were almost entirely independent of Baghdad. They became even greater patrons of religion and the arts than the Tahirids, still maintaining orthodox Sunni ideology but differing in their promotion of the Persian language.

There was a brief Abbasid political and military revival at the end of the 9th century, especially under the policies of caliph al-Mu&#x27;tadid () and al-Muktafi (). Under al-Mu&#x27;tadid, the capital was moved from Samarra back to Baghdad. Incursions by the Qarmatians and allied Bedouin tribes posed a serious threat from 899 onwards, but the Abbasid army, led by Muhammad ibn Sulayman, won a reprieve against them in 904 and 907. In 905, the same general invaded Egypt and overthrew the weakened Tulunids, re-establishing Abbasid control to the west. By the time caliph al-Muktafi died in 908, the Abbasid revival was at its peak and a strong centralized state was in place again. 

After his death, however, the state became dominated by feuding bureaucrats. Under al-Muqtadir (), the Abbasid court continued to project power and wealth publicly but the politics and financial policies of the time compromised the caliphate&#x27;s sustainability in the long-term. It was in this period that the practice of giving out &quot;iqta&quot;s (fiefs in the form of tax farms) as favours began, which had the effect of reducing the caliphate&#x27;s own tax revenues.

In 909, North Africa was lost to the Fatimid dynasty, an Isma&#x27;ili Shia sect tracing its roots to Muhammad&#x27;s daughter Fatima. The Fatimids took control of Ifriqiya from the Aghlabids and eventually conquered Egypt in 969, where they established their capital, Cairo, near Fustat. By the end of the century, they were one of the main political and ideological challenges to Sunni Islam and the Abbasids, contesting the Abbasids for the titular authority of the Islamic &quot;ummah&quot;. The challenge of the Fatimid Caliphate only ended with their downfall in the 12th century.

Under the caliph al-Radi (), Baghdad&#x27;s authority declined further as local governors refused to send payments to the capital. The Ikhshidids ruled Egypt and Syria autonomously prior to the Fatimid takeover. Even in Iraq, many governors refused to obey and the caliph was unable to send armies against them. Al-Radi was forced to invite the governor of Wasit, Muhammad ibn Ra&#x27;iq, to take over the administration under the newly-created position of &quot;amir al-umara&quot; (&quot;Commander of Commanders&quot;). Ibn Ra&#x27;iq disbanded the salaried army of the caliph and reduced much of the government&#x27;s bureaucratic infrastructure, including the traditional vizierate, thus removing much of the Abbasid state&#x27;s basis for power. He was overthrown in 938 and the following years were bogged down in political turmoil.

Al-Mustakfi had a short reign from 944 to 946, and it was during this period that the Persian faction known as the Buyids from Daylam swept into power and assumed control over the bureaucracy in Baghdad. According to the history of Miskawayh, they began distributing &quot;iqta&quot;s to their supporters. This period of localized secular control was to last nearly 100 years.

Outside Iraq, all the autonomous provinces slowly took on the characteristic of de facto states with hereditary rulers, armies, and revenues and operated under only nominal caliph suzerainty, which may not necessarily be reflected by any contribution to the treasury, such as the Soomro emirs that had gained control of Sindh and ruled the entire province from their capital of Mansura. Mahmud of Ghazni took the title of sultan, as opposed to the &quot;amir&quot; that had been in more common usage, signifying the Ghaznavid Empire&#x27;s independence from caliphal authority, despite Mahmud&#x27;s ostentatious displays of Sunni orthodoxy and ritual submission to the caliph. In the 11th century, the loss of respect for the caliphs continued, as some Islamic rulers no longer mentioned the caliph&#x27;s name in the Friday &quot;khutba&quot;, or struck it off their coinage.

===Buyid and Seljuq control (945–1118)===

Despite the power of the Buyid amirs, the Abbasids retained a highly ritualized court in Baghdad, as described by the Buyid bureaucrat Hilal al-Sabi&#x27;, and they retained a certain influence over Baghdad as well as religious life. As Buyid power waned with the rule of Baha&#x27; al-Daula, the caliphate was able to regain some measure of strength. The caliph al-Qadir, for example, led the ideological struggle against the Shia with writings such as the &quot;Baghdad Manifesto&quot;. The caliphs kept order in Baghdad itself, attempting to prevent the outbreak of &quot;fitna&quot;s in the capital, often contending with the &quot;ayyarun&quot;.

With the Buyid dynasty on the wane, a vacuum was created that was eventually filled by the dynasty of Oghuz Turks known as the Seljuqs. By 1055, the Seljuqs had wrested control from the Buyids and Abbasids, and took temporal power. When the amir and former slave Basasiri took up the Shia Fatimid banner in Baghdad in 1056–57, the caliph al-Qa&#x27;im was unable to defeat him without outside help. Toghril Beg, the Seljuq sultan, restored Baghdad to Sunni rule and took Iraq for his dynasty.

Once again, the Abbasids were forced to deal with a military power that they could not match, though the Abbasid caliph remained the titular head of the Islamic community. The succeeding sultans Alp Arslan and Malikshah, as well as their vizier Nizam al-Mulk, took up residence in Persia, but held power over the Abbasids in Baghdad. When the dynasty began to weaken in the 12th century, the Abbasids gained greater independence once again.

===Revival of caliphal state (1118–1258)===
Caliph al-Mustarshid () was the first caliph to build an army and to lead it in battle since the 10th century. He recruited Kurdish and Arab Bedouin tribes and re-fortified Baghdad. His first concern was not the Seljuks but the Mazyadids of Hilla in central Iraq, whom he met in battle in 1123. His bid for independence was ultimately unsuccessful, as he was defeated by a Seljuk army in 1135 and assassinated soon after. 

Under al-Muqtafi (), a new caliphal state began to emerge with the help of his vizier Ibn Hubayra. Ibn Hubayra concentrated on reasserting authority in Iraq while the Seljuk Empire deteriorated. The Abbasids successfully defended Baghdad against the Seljuqs in the siege of 1157 and then conquered their Mazyadid enemies in Hilla in 1162. By the end of al-Muqtafi&#x27;s reign, Baghdad controlled a state stretching from Basra in the south to the edges of Mosul in the north. After over two hundred years of Abbasid subjection to foreign dynasties, Caliph al-Mustanjid () formally declared independence from the Seljuk sultans in 1165, when he dropped their names from Abbasid coinage. Initially, the caliphs were still vulnerable to the power of the viziers, but al-Mustadi () was able to further rally some support from the Baghdad public as well as symbolic support abroad from the Ayyubid sultan Saladin and the Rum Seljuk sultan Kilij Arslan II.

The long reign of Caliph al-Nasir () marked a definitive shift in late Abbasid power. He reinvigorated public displays of caliphal prestige, removed officials who were too powerful, engaged in diplomacy with regions beyond Iraq, and extended his control over former Seljuk territories in western Iran — including Isfahan, Hamadan, Qazvin and Zanjan. He sought to build up his influence among Muslim rulers abroad largely through the Sufi-inspired &quot;futuwwa&quot; brotherhood that he headed. Under caliph al-Mustansir (), the Abbasid state achieved significant stability and many of the same policies continued. He built the Mustansiriyya Madrasa, inaugurated in 1234, the first madrasa to teach all four Sunni &quot;maddhab&quot;s (schools of jurisprudence) and the first madrasa commissioned by an Abbasid caliph.

===Mongol invasion and end===

In 1206, Genghis Khan established a powerful dynasty among the Mongols of central Asia. During the 13th century, this Mongol Empire conquered most of the Eurasian land mass, including both China in the east and much of the old Islamic caliphate (as well as Kievan Rus&#x27;) in the west. Hulagu Khan&#x27;s destruction of Baghdad in 1258 is traditionally seen as the approximate end of the Golden Age.

Contemporary accounts state Mongol soldiers looted and then destroyed mosques, palaces, libraries, and hospitals. Priceless books from Baghdad&#x27;s thirty-six public libraries were torn apart, the looters using their leather covers as sandals. Grand buildings that had been the work of generations were burned to the ground. The House of Wisdom (the Grand Library of Baghdad), containing countless precious historical documents and books on subjects ranging from medicine to astronomy, was destroyed. Claims have been made that the Tigris ran red from the blood of the scientists and philosophers killed. Citizens attempted to flee, but were intercepted by Mongol soldiers who killed in abundance, sparing no one, not even children.

The caliph Al-Musta&#x27;sim was captured and forced to watch as his citizens were murdered and his treasury plundered. Ironically, Mongols feared that a supernatural disaster would strike if the blood of Al-Musta&#x27;sim, a direct descendant of Muhammad&#x27;s uncle Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib, and the last reigning Abbasid caliph in Baghdad, was spilled. The Shia of Persia stated that no such calamity had happened after the death of Husayn ibn Ali in the Battle of Karbala; nevertheless, as a precaution and in accordance with a Mongol taboo which forbade spilling royal blood, Hulagu had Al-Musta&#x27;sim wrapped in a carpet and trampled to death by horses on 20 February 1258. The caliph&#x27;s immediate family was also executed, with the lone exceptions of his youngest son who was sent to Mongolia, and a daughter who became a slave in the harem of Hulagu.

==== Abbasid Caliphate of Cairo (1261–1517) ====

Similarly to how a Mamluk Army was created by the Abbasids, a Mamluk Army was created by the Egypt-based Ayyubid dynasty. These Mamluks decided to directly overthrow their masters and came to power in 1250 in what is known as the Mamluk Sultanate. In 1261, following the devastation of Baghdad by the Mongols, the Mamluk rulers of Egypt re-established the Abbasid caliphate in Cairo. The first Abbasid caliph of Cairo was Al-Mustansir. The Abbasid caliphs in Egypt continued to maintain the presence of authority, but it was confined to religious matters. The Abbasid caliphate of Cairo lasted until the time of Al-Mutawakkil III, who was taken away as a prisoner by Selim I to Constantinople where he had a ceremonial role. He died in 1543, following his return to Cairo.

==Culture==

===Islamic Golden Age===


The Abbasid historical period lasting to the Mongol conquest of Baghdad in 1258 CE is considered the Islamic Golden Age. The Islamic Golden Age was inaugurated by the middle of the 8th century by the ascension of the Abbasid Caliphate and the transfer of the capital from Damascus to Baghdad. The Abbasids were influenced by the Qur&#x27;anic injunctions and hadith, such as &quot;the ink of a scholar is more holy than the blood of a martyr&quot;, stressing the value of knowledge. During this period the Muslim world became an intellectual center for science, philosophy, medicine and education as the Abbasids championed the cause of knowledge and established the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, where both Muslim and non-Muslim scholars sought to translate and gather all the world&#x27;s knowledge into Arabic. Many classic works of antiquity that would otherwise have been lost were translated into Arabic and Persian and later in turn translated into Turkish, Hebrew and Latin. During this period the Muslim world was a cauldron of cultures which collected, synthesized and significantly advanced the knowledge gained from the Roman, Chinese, Indian, Persian, Egyptian, North African, Ancient Greek and Medieval Greek civilizations. According to Huff, &quot;[i]n virtually every field of endeavor—in astronomy, alchemy, mathematics, medicine, optics and so forth—the Caliphate&#x27;s scientists were in the forefront of scientific advance.&quot;

===Literature===

The best-known fiction from the Islamic world is &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, a collection of fantastical folk tales, legends and parables compiled primarily during the Abbasid era. The collection is recorded as having originated from an Arabic translation of a Sassanian-era Persian prototype, with likely origins in Indian literary traditions. Stories from Arabic, Persian, Mesopotamian, and Egyptian folklore and literature were later incorporated. The epic is believed to have taken shape in the 10th century and reached its final form by the 14th century; the number and type of tales have varied from one manuscript to another. All Arabian fantasy tales were often called &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; when translated into English, regardless of whether they appeared in &quot;The Book of One Thousand and One Nights&quot;. This epic has been influential in the West since it was translated in the 18th century, first by Antoine Galland. Many imitations were written, especially in France. Various characters from this epic have themselves become cultural icons in Western culture, such as Aladdin, Sinbad and Ali Baba.

A famous example of Islamic poetry on romance was &quot;Layla and Majnun&quot;, an originally Arabic story which was further developed by Iranian, Azerbaijani and other poets in the Persian, Azerbaijani, and Turkish languages. It is a tragic story of undying love much like the later &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

Arabic poetry reached its greatest height in the Abbasid era, especially before the loss of central authority and the rise of the Persianate dynasties. Writers like Abu Tammam and Abu Nuwas were closely connected to the caliphal court in Baghdad during the early 9th century, while others such as al-Mutanabbi received their patronage from regional courts.

Under Harun al-Rashid, Baghdad was renowned for its bookstores, which proliferated after the making of paper was introduced. Chinese papermakers had been among those taken prisoner by the Arabs at the Battle of Talas in 751. As prisoners of war, they were dispatched to Samarkand, where they helped set up the first Arab paper mill. In time, paper replaced parchment as the medium for writing, and the production of books greatly increased. These events had an academic and societal impact that could be broadly compared to the introduction of the printing press in the West. Paper aided in communication and record-keeping, it also brought a new sophistication and complexity to businesses, banking, and the civil service. In 794, Jafa al-Barmak built the first paper mill in Baghdad, and from there the technology circulated. Harun required that paper be employed in government dealings, since something recorded on paper could not easily be changed or removed, and eventually, an entire street in Baghdad&#x27;s business district was dedicated to selling paper and books.

===Philosophy===

One of the common definitions for &quot;Islamic philosophy&quot; is &quot;the style of philosophy produced within the framework of Islamic culture&quot;. Islamic philosophy, in this definition is neither necessarily concerned with religious issues, nor is exclusively produced by Muslims. Their works on Aristotle were a key step in the transmission of learning from ancient Greeks to the Islamic world and the West. They often corrected the philosopher, encouraging a lively debate in the spirit of ijtihad. They also wrote influential original philosophical works, and their thinking was incorporated into Christian philosophy during the Middle Ages, notably by Thomas Aquinas.

Three speculative thinkers, al-Kindi, al-Farabi, and Avicenna, combined Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism with other ideas introduced through Islam, and Avicennism was later established as a result. Other influential Abbasid philosophers include al-Jahiz, and Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen).

===Architecture===
As power shifted from the Umayyads to the Abbasids, the architectural styles changed also, from Greco-Roman tradition (which features elements of Hellenistic and Roman representative style) to Eastern tradition which retained their independent architectural traditions from Mesopotamia and Persia. The Abbasid architecture was particularly influenced by Sasanian architecture, which in turn featured elements present since ancient Mesopotamia. The Christian styles evolved into a style based more on the Sasanian Empire, utilizing mud bricks and baked bricks with carved stucco. Other architectural innovations and styles were few, such as the four-centered arch, and a dome erected on squinches. Unfortunately, much was lost due to the ephemeral nature of the stucco and luster tiles.
Another major development was the creation or vast enlargement of cities as they were turned into the capital of the empire, beginning with the creation of Baghdad in 762, which was planned as a walled city with four gates, and a mosque and palace in the center. Al-Mansur, who was responsible for the creation of Baghdad, also planned the city of Raqqa, along the Euphrates. Finally, in 836, al-Mu&#x27;tasim moved the capital to a new site that he created along the Tigris, called Samarra. This city saw 60 years of work, with race-courses and game preserves to add to the atmosphere. Due to the dry remote nature of the environment, some of the palaces built in this era were isolated havens. Al-Ukhaidir Fortress is a fine example of this type of building, which has stables, living quarters, and a mosque, all surrounding inner courtyards. Mesopotamia only has one surviving mausoleum from this era, in Samarra: an octagonal domed structured known as the &quot;Qubbat al-Sulaibiyya&quot;, which is the first known monumental tomb in Islamic architecture and may be the final resting place of al-Muntasir.

Baghdad, the epicenter of the empire, was originally organized in a circular fashion next to the Tigris River, with massive brick walls being constructed in successive rings around the core by a workforce of 100,000 with four huge gates (named Kufa, Basra, Khorasan and Syria). The central enclosure of the city contained Mansur&#x27;s palace of in area and the great mosque of Baghdad, encompassing . Travel across the Tigris and the network of waterways allowing the drainage of the Euphrates into the Tigris was facilitated by bridges and canals servicing the population.

Outside the Abbasid heartlands, architecture was still influenced by the capital. In present-day Tunisia, the Great Mosque of Kairouan was founded under the Umayyad dynasty but completely rebuilt in the 9th century under the patronage of the Aghlabids, vassals of the Abbasids. The styles utilized were mainly Abbasid. In Egypt, Ahmad Ibn Tulun commissioned the Ibn Tulun Mosque, completed in 879, that is based on the style of Samarra and is now one of the best-preserved Abbasid-style mosques from this period.

===Glass and crystal===
The Near East has, since Roman times, been recognized as a center of quality glassware and crystal. 9th-century finds from Samarra show styles similar to Sassanian forms. The types of objects made were bottles, flasks, vases, and cups intended for domestic use, with decorations including molded flutes, honeycomb patterns, and inscriptions. Other styles seen that may not have come from the Sassanians were stamped items. These were typically round stamps, such as medallions or disks with animals, birds, or Kufic inscriptions. Colored lead glass, typically blue or green, has been found in Nishapur, along with prismatic perfume bottles. Finally, cut glass may have been the high point of Abbasid glass-working, decorated with floral and animal designs.

===Painting===

Early Abbasid painting has not survived in great quantities, and is sometimes harder to differentiate; however, Samarra provides good examples, as it was built by the Abbasids and abandoned 56 years later. The walls of the principal rooms of the palace that have been excavated show wall paintings and lively carved stucco dadoes. The earlier style is obviously adopted with little variation from Sassanian art, with similar styles, with harems, animals, dancing people, and garments, all enclosed in scrollwork. Nishapur had its own school of painting. Excavations at Nishapur show both monochromatic and polychromatic artwork from the 8th and 9th centuries. One famous piece of art consists of hunting nobles with falcons and on horseback, in full regalia; the clothing identifies them as Tahirid, which was, again, a sub-dynasty of the Abbasids. Other styles are of vegetation, and fruit in nice colors on a four-foot high dedo.

===Pottery===
Whereas painting and architecture were not areas of strength for the Abbasid dynasty, pottery was a different story. Islamic culture as a whole, and the Abbasids in particular, were at the forefront of new ideas and techniques. Some examples of their work were pieces engraved with decorations and then colored with yellow-brown, green, and purple glazes. Designs were diverse with geometric patterns, Kufic lettering, and arabesque scrollwork, along with rosettes, animals, birds, and humans. Abbasid pottery from the 8th and 9th centuries has been found throughout the region, as far as Cairo. These were generally made with a yellow clay and fired multiple times with separate glazes to produce metallic luster in shades of gold, brown, or red. By the 9th century, the potters had mastered their techniques and their decorative designs could be divided into two styles. The Persian style would show animals, birds, and humans, along with Kufic lettering in gold. Pieces excavated from Samarra exceed in vibrancy and beauty any from later periods. These were predominantly being made for the caliph&#x27;s use. Tiles were also made using this same technique to create both monochromatic and polychromatic lusterware tiles.

===Textiles===
Egypt being a center of the textile industry was part of Abbasid cultural advancement. Copts were employed in the textile industry and produced linens and silks. Tinnis was famous for its factories and had over 5,000 looms. Examples of textiles were &quot;kasab&quot;, a fine linen for turbans, and &quot;badana&quot; for upper-class garments. The kiswah for the kaaba in Mecca was made in a town named Tuna near Tinnis. Fine silk was also made in Dabik and Damietta. Of particular interest are stamped and inscribed fabrics, which used not only inks but also liquid gold. Some of the finer pieces were colored in such a manner as to require six separate stamps to achieve the proper design and color. This technology spread to Europe eventually.

=== Clothing ===

The Abbasid period saw a large fashion development throughout its existence. While the development of fashion began during the Umayyad period, its genuine cosmopolitan styles and influence were realized at their finest during Abbasid rule. Fashion was a thriving industry during the Abbasid period that was also strictly regulated either by law or through the accepted elements of style. Among the higher classes, appearance became a concern and they started to care about appearance and fashion. Several new garments and fabrics were introduced into common use and no longer observed pious distaste for materials such as silk and satins. The rise of the Persian secretarial class had a large influence over the development of fashion and the Abbasids were highly influenced by the older Persian Court dress elements. For example, the caliph al-Muʿtasim was reportedly notable for his desire to imitate Persian kings by wearing a turban over a soft cap which was later adopted by other Abbasid rulers and called it the &quot;muʿtasimi&quot; in his honor.

The Abbasids wore many layers of garments. Fabrics used for the clothing seemed to have included wool, linen, brocades, or silk the clothing of the poorer classes was made out of cheaper materials, such as wool, and had less fabric. This also meant they wouldn&#x27;t be able to afford the variety of garments that the elite classes wore. Elegant women would not wear black, green, red, or pink, except for fabrics that naturally had those colors, such as red silk. Women&#x27;s clothing would be perfumed with musk, sandalwood, hyacinth or ambergris, but no other scents. Footwear included furry Cambay shoes, boots of the style of Persian ladies, and curved shoes.

Caliph al-Mansur was credited with making his court and the Abbasid high-ranking officials wear honorific robes of the color black for various ceremonial affairs and events which became the official color of the caliphate. This was acknowledged in China and Byzantium who called the Abbasids the &quot;black-robed ones&quot;. But despite the color black being common during the caliphate, many color dyes existed and it was made sure that colors would not clash. Notably, the color yellow needed to be avoided when wearing colored clothing.

Abbasid Caliphs wore elegant kaftans, a robe made from silver or gold brocade and buttons in the front of the sleeves. Caliph al-Muqtaddir wore a kaftan from silver brocade Tustari silk and his son one made from Byzantine silk richly decorated or ornamented with figures. The kaftan was spread far and wide by the Abbasids and made known throughout the Arab world. In the 830s, Emperor Theophilus, went about &quot;à l&#x27;arabe&quot; in kaftans and turbans. Even as far as the streets of Ghuangzhou during the era of Tang dynasty, the Persian kaftan was in fashion.

=== Manuscripts ===

The production of Qur&#x27;anic manuscripts flourished under the Abbasid Caliphate primarily between the late 8th and early 10th century. During this period, copies of the Qur&#x27;an were frequently commissioned for members of the Abbasid court and the wealthy elite in Muslim society. With the increased dissemination of the Qur&#x27;an also came the growth of Arabic calligraphy, bookbinding techniques, and illumination styles. This expansion and establishment of the book arts culminated in a formative period of the Islamic manuscript tradition.

==== Calligraphy ====

The earliest style of calligraphy used for Abbasid Qur&#x27;ans was known as the Kufic script—a script distinguished by precise, angular letters, generous spacing, horizontal extension of letters at the baseline and an emphasis on geometric proportion. Qur&#x27;ans copied in this script were typically formatted in a horizontal manner and were written on parchment. Qur&#x27;ans of this variety were most popular in the second half of the 8th century.

During the late 9th century and early 10th century, a new system of calligraphy was introduced by Abbasid vizier and calligrapher Abu &#x27;Ali Muhammad Ibn Muqla (866–940). He developed this proportional writing system around two shapes: a circle the size of an alif and rhomboid dots that could be created with the nib of a reed pen. This script, later known as the &quot;New Abbasid style&quot;, was characterized by its vertical letters, extreme angularity, and a distinct contrast between the width of strokes. The development of this proportional script also coincided with a shift back into a vertical page orientation. The New style script was further developed for secular purposes because of its legibility and efficient nature.

==== Illumination ====

Illumination techniques and trends under the Abbasid Caliphate were often dependent upon script style. As Qur&#x27;ans shifted from Kufic to New style script, illumination methods also changed. The illumination of early Abbasid Qur&#x27;ans (late 8th century) was largely dominated by geometric and vegetal shapes. These ornamental elements were often concentrated at the beginning and end of volumes as well as in between Suras. Another defining element of the early Abbasid technique was the absence of text on the frontispiece of the Qur&#x27;an. The introduction of the &quot;New Abbasid Style&quot; in the 10th century, however, led to a shift in illumination techniques. Illuminators found ways to accommodate the dense script and vertical orientation of text. As such, illuminated Qur&#x27;ans began to display additional decorative elements (beyond geometric and vegetal shapes) to denote divisions within the text. Furthermore, Qur&#x27;ans with the New style of script were copied with the first Sura on the frontispiece of the manuscript. These stylistic shifts are representative of developing illumination arts under Abbasid rule.

==== Bookbinding ====
The main form of bookbinding used under the Abbasid Caliphate was the binding-cum-case or box manuscript. This technique covered the Qur&#x27;an in a casket-like box in order to protect the contents. These boxes were typically made out of wooden boards and had a protective lining on the manuscript-facing side. The leather-bound Qur&#x27;an would have been placed in the box which then would have been fitted with a locking mechanism.

==== The Amajur Qur&#x27;an ====
One of the most notable parchment manuscripts created during the early Abbasid Caliphate was the Amajur Qur&#x27;an. This Qur&#x27;an was endowed by Amajur al-Turki—the Abbasid Governor of Damascus from 870 to 878—and was created during the 9th century. Despite being a luxury example, this Qur&#x27;an is indicative of the form and script practices that were being standardized in the heart of the early Abbasid Caliphate. The text was copied in the Kufic style and in a horizontal orientation. The style of script, size, and oblong shape of the Amajur Qur&#x27;an aligned with other examples from the 9th century. Furthermore, the Qur&#x27;an was copied onto parchment—a material that was commonly used for manuscripts under early Abbasid rule. Lastly, the Amajur Qur&#x27;an was bound in leather and stored in a protective chest. This bookbinding style was a standard technique during the 9th century.

== Science and technology ==

===Science===

A number of medieval thinkers and scientists living under Islamic rule played a role in transmitting Islamic science to the Christian West. In addition, the period saw the recovery of much of the Alexandrian mathematical, geometric and astronomical knowledge, such as that of Euclid and Claudius Ptolemy. These recovered mathematical methods were later enhanced and developed by other Islamic scholars, notably by Persian scientists Al-Biruni and Abu Nasr Mansur.

Christians (particularly Nestorian Christians) contributed to the Arab Islamic Civilization during the Umayyads and the Abbasids by translating works of Greek philosophers to Syriac and afterwards to Arabic. Nestorians played a prominent role in the formation of Arab culture, with the Academy of Gondishapur being prominent in the late Sassanid, Umayyad and early Abbasid periods. Notably, eight generations of the Nestorian Bukhtishu family served as private doctors to caliphs and sultans between the eighth and eleventh centuries.

Algebra was significantly developed by Persian scientist Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī during this time in his landmark text, &quot;Kitab al-Jabr wa-l-Muqabala&quot;, from which the term &quot;algebra&quot; is derived. He is thus considered to be the father of algebra by some, although the Greek mathematician Diophantus has also been given this title. The terms algorism and algorithm are derived from the name of al-Khwarizmi, who was also responsible for introducing the Arabic numerals and Hindu–Arabic numeral system beyond the Indian subcontinent.
Arab scientist Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) developed an early scientific method in his &quot;Book of Optics&quot; (1021). The most important development of the scientific method was the use of experiments to distinguish between competing scientific theories set within a generally empirical orientation, which began among Muslim scientists. Ibn al-Haytham&#x27;s empirical proof of the intromission theory of light (that is, that light rays entered the eyes rather than being emitted by them) was particularly important. Ibn al-Haytham was significant in the history of scientific method, particularly in his approach to experimentation, and has been referred to as the &quot;world&#x27;s first true scientist&quot;.

Medicine in medieval Islam was an area of science that advanced particularly during the Abbasids&#x27; reign. During the 9th century, Baghdad contained over 800 doctors, and great discoveries in the understanding of anatomy and diseases were made. The clinical distinction between measles and smallpox was described during this time. Famous Persian scientist Ibn Sina (known to the West as Avicenna) produced treatises and works that summarized the vast amount of knowledge that scientists had accumulated, and was very influential through his encyclopedias, &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot; and &quot;The Book of Healing&quot;. The work of him and many others directly influenced the research of European scientists during the Renaissance.

Astronomy in medieval Islam was advanced by Al-Battani, who improved the precision of the measurement of the precession of the Earth&#x27;s axis. The corrections made to the geocentric model by al-Battani, Averroes, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, Mo&#x27;ayyeduddin Urdi and Ibn al-Shatir were later incorporated into the Copernican heliocentric model. The astrolabe, though originally developed by the Greeks, was developed further by Islamic astronomers and engineers, and subsequently brought to medieval Europe.

Muslim alchemists influenced medieval European alchemists, particularly the writings attributed to Jābir ibn Hayyān (Geber).

===Technology===
In technology, the Abbasids adopted papermaking from China. The use of paper spread from China into the caliphate in the 8th century CE, arriving in al-Andalus (Islamic Spain) and then the rest of Europe in the 10th century. It was easier to manufacture than parchment, less likely to crack than papyrus, and could absorb ink, making it ideal for making records and copies of the Qur&#x27;an. &quot;Islamic paper makers devised assembly-line methods of hand-copying manuscripts to turn out editions far larger than any available in Europe for centuries.&quot; It was from the Abbasids that the rest of the world learned to make paper from linen. The knowledge of gunpowder was also transmitted from China via the caliphate, where the formulas for pure potassium nitrate and an explosive gunpowder effect were first developed.

Advances were made in irrigation and farming, using new technology such as the windmill. Crops such as almonds and citrus fruit were brought to Europe through al-Andalus, and sugar cultivation was gradually adopted by the Europeans. Apart from the Nile, Tigris and Euphrates, navigable rivers were uncommon, so transport by sea was very important. Navigational sciences were highly developed, making use of a rudimentary sextant (known as a kamal). When combined with detailed maps of the period, sailors were able to sail across oceans rather than skirt along the coast. Abbasid sailors were also responsible for reintroducing large three masted merchant vessels to the Mediterranean. The name caravel may derive from an earlier Arab ship known as the &quot;qārib&quot;. Arab merchants dominated trade in the Indian Ocean until the arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century. Hormuz was an important center for this trade. There was also a dense network of trade routes in the Mediterranean, along which Muslim countries traded with each other and with European powers such as Venice or Genoa. The Silk Road crossing Central Asia passed through the Abbasid caliphate between China and Europe.

Engineers in the Abbasid caliphate made a number of innovative industrial uses of hydropower, and early industrial uses of tidal power, wind power, and petroleum (notably by distillation into kerosene). The industrial uses of watermills in the Islamic world date back to the 7th century, while horizontal-wheeled and vertical-wheeled water mills were both in widespread use since at least the 9th century. By the time of the Crusades, every province throughout the Islamic world had mills in operation, from al-Andalus and North Africa to the Middle East and Central Asia. These mills performed a variety of agricultural and industrial tasks. Abbasid engineers also developed machines (such as pumps) incorporating crankshafts, employed gears in mills and water-raising machines, and used dams to provide additional power to watermills and water-raising machines. Such advances made it possible for many industrial tasks that were previously driven by manual labour in ancient times to be mechanized and driven by machinery instead in the medieval Islamic world. It has been argued that the industrial use of waterpower had spread from Islamic to Christian Spain, where fulling mills, paper mills, and forge mills were recorded for the first time in Catalonia.

A number of industries were generated during the Arab Agricultural Revolution, including early industries for textiles, sugar, rope-making, matting, silk, and paper. Latin translations of the 12th century passed on knowledge of chemistry and instrument making in particular. The agricultural and handicraft industries also experienced high levels of growth during this period.

== Society ==

===Arabization===
While the Abbasids originally gained power by exploiting the social inequalities against non-Arabs in the Umayyad Empire, during Abbasid rule the empire rapidly Arabized, particularly in the Fertile Crescent region (namely Mesopotamia and the Levant) as had begun under Umayyad rule. As knowledge was shared in the Arabic language throughout the empire, many people from different nationalities and religions began to speak Arabic in their everyday lives. Resources from other languages began to be translated into Arabic, and a unique Islamic identity began to form that fused previous cultures with Arab culture, creating a level of civilization and knowledge that was considered a marvel in Europe at the time.

===Status of women===

In contrast to the earlier era, women in Abbasid society were absent from all arenas of the community&#x27;s central affairs. While their Muslim forebears led men into battle, started rebellions, and played an active role in community life, as demonstrated in the Hadith literature, Abbasid women were ideally kept in seclusion. Conquests had brought enormous wealth and large numbers of slaves to the Muslim elite. The majority of the slaves were women and children, many of whom had been dependents or harem-members of the defeated Sassanian upper classes. In the wake of the conquests an elite man could potentially own a thousand slaves, and ordinary soldiers could have ten people serving them.

It was narrated from Ibn Abbas that Muhammad said:

Even so, slave courtesans (qiyans and jawaris) and princesses produced prestigious and important poetry. Enough survives to give us access to women&#x27;s historical experiences, and reveals some vivacious and powerful figures, such as the Sufi mystic Raabi&#x27;a al-Adwiyya (714–801 CE), the princess and poet &#x27;Ulayya bint al-Mahdi (777–825 CE), and the singing-girls Shāriyah (–870 CE), Fadl Ashsha&#x27;ira (d. 871 CE) and Arib al-Ma&#x27;muniyya (797–890 CE).

Each wife in the Abbasid harem had an additional home or flat, with her own enslaved staff of eunuchs and maidservants. When a concubine gave birth to a son, she was elevated in rank to umm walad and also received apartments and (slave) servants as a gift.

=== Treatment of Jews and Christians ===

The status and treatment of Jews, Christians, and non-Muslims in the Abbasid Caliphate was a complex and continually changing issue. Non-Muslims were called dhimmis. Dhimmis faced some level of discrimination in Abbasid society: they did not have all the privileges of Muslims and had to pay jizya, a tax on non-Muslims. However, as people of the book (non-Muslim monotheists), Jews and Christians were allowed to practice their religion and were not required to convert.

One of the common aspects of the treatment of the dhimmis is that their treatment depended on who the caliph was at the time. Some Abbasid rulers, like Al-Mutawakkil (822–861 CE) imposed strict restrictions on what dhimmis could wear in public, often yellow garments that distinguished them from Muslims. Other restrictions al-Mutawakkil imposed included limiting the role of the dhimmis in government, seizing dhimmi housing and making it harder for dhimmis to become educated. Most other Abbasid caliphs were not as strict as al-Mutawakkil, though. During the reign of Al-Mansur (714–775 CE), it was common for Jews and Christians to influence the overall culture in the caliphate, specifically in Baghdad. Jews and Christians did this by participating in scholarly work.

It was common that laws that were imposed against dhimmis during one caliph&#x27;s rule were either discarded or not practiced during future caliphs&#x27; reigns. Al-Mansur and al-Mutawakkil both instituted laws that forbade non-Muslims from participating in public office. Al-Mansur did not follow his own law very closely, bringing dhimmis back to the caliphate&#x27;s treasury due to the needed expertise of dhimmis in the area of finance. Al-Mutawakkil followed the law banning dhimmis from public office more seriously, although, soon after his reign, many of the laws concerning dhimmis participating in government were completely unobserved or at least less strictly observed. Even Al-Muqtadir (), who held a similar stance as al-Mutawakkil on barring non-Muslims from public office, himself had multiple Christian secretaries, indicating that non-Muslims still had access to many of the most important figures within the caliphate. Past having a casual association or just being a secretary to high-ranking Islamic officials, some of them achieved the second highest office after the caliph: the vizier.
Jews and Christians may have had a lower overall status compared to Muslims in the Abbasid Caliphate, but dhimmis were often allowed to hold respectable and even prestigious occupations in some cases, such as doctors and public officeholders. Jews and Christians were also allowed to be rich even if they were taxed for being a dhimmi. Dhimmis were capable of moving up and down the social ladder, though this largely depended on the particular caliph. An indication as to the social standing of Jews and Christians at the time was their ability to live next to Muslim people. While al-Mansur was ruling the caliphate, for instance, it was not uncommon for dhimmis to live in the same neighborhoods as Muslims. One of the biggest reasons why dhimmis were allowed to hold prestigious jobs and positions in government is that they were generally important to the well-being of the state and were proficient to excellent with the work at hand. Some Muslims in the caliphate took offense to the idea that there were dhimmis in public offices who were in a way ruling over them although it was an Islamic state, while other Muslims were at time jealous of some dhimmis for having a level of wealth or prestige greater than other Muslims, even if Muslims were still the majority of the ruling class. In general, Muslims, Jews, and Christians had close relations that could be considered positive at times, especially for Jews, in contrast to how Jews were being treated in Europe.

Many of the laws and restrictions that were imposed on dhimmis often resembled other laws that previous states had used to discriminate against a minority religion, specifically Jewish people. Romans in the fourth century banned Jewish people from holding public offices, banned Roman citizens from converting to Judaism, and often demoted Jews who were serving in the Roman military. In direct contrast, there was an event in which two viziers, Ibn al-Furat and Ali ibn Isa ibn al-Jarrah, argued about Ibn al-Furat&#x27;s decision to make a Christian the head of the military. A previous vizier, Abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-Bazuri, had done so. These laws predated al-Mansur&#x27;s laws against dhimmis and often had similar restrictions, although Roman emperors were often much more strict on enforcing these laws than many Abbasid caliphs.

Most of Baghdad&#x27;s Jews were incorporated into the Arab community and considered Arabic their native language. Some Jews studied Hebrew in their schools and Jewish religious education flourished. The united Muslim empire allowed Jews to reconstruct links between their dispersed communities throughout the Middle East. The city&#x27;s Talmudic institute helped spread the rabbinical tradition to Europe, and the Jewish community in Baghdad went on to establish ten rabbinical schools and twenty-three synagogues. Baghdad not only contained the tombs of Muslim saints and martyrs, but also the tomb of Yusha, whose corpse had been brought to Iraq during the first migration of the Jews out of the Levant.

===Holidays===
There were large feasts on certain days, as the Muslims of the empire celebrated Christian holidays as well as their own. There were two main Islamic feasts: one marked by the end of Ramadan; the other, &quot;the Feast of Sacrifice&quot;. The former was especially joyful because children would purchase decorations and sweetmeats; people prepared the best food and bought new clothes. At midmorning, the caliph, wearing Muhammad&#x27;s thobe, would guide officials, accompanied by armed soldiers to the Great Mosque, where he led prayers. After the prayer, all those in attendance would exchange the best wishes and hug their kin and companions. The festivities lasted for three days. During those limited number of nights, the palaces were lit up and boats on the Tigris hung lights. It was said that Baghdad &quot;glittered &#x27;like a bride. During the Feast of Sacrifice, sheep were butchered in public arenas and the caliph participated in a large-scale sacrifice in the palace courtyard. Afterward, the meat would be divided and given to the poor.

In addition to these two holidays, Shias celebrated the birthdays of Fatimah and Ali ibn Abi Talib. Matrimonies and births in the royal family were observed by all in the empire. The announcement that one of the caliph&#x27;s sons could recite the Koran smoothly was greeted by communal jubilation. When Harun developed this holy talent, the people lit torches and decorated the streets with wreaths of flowers, and his father, Al-Mahdi, freed 500 slaves.

Of all the holidays imported from other cultures and religions, the one most celebrated in Baghdad (a city with many Persians) was Nowruz, which celebrated the arrival of spring. In a ceremonial ablution introduced by Persian troops, residents sprinkled themselves with water and ate almond cakes. The palaces of the imperial family were lit up for six days and nights. The Abbasids also celebrated the Persian holiday of Mihraj, which marked the onset of winter (signified with pounding drums), and Sadar, when homes burned incense and the masses would congregate along the Tigris to witness princes and viziers pass by.

==Military==

In Baghdad there were many Abbasid military leaders who were or said they were of Arab descent. However, it is clear that most of the ranks were of Iranian origin, the vast majority being from Khorasan and Transoxiana, not from western Iran or Azerbaijan. Most of the Khorasani soldiers who brought the Abbasids to power were Arabs.
The standing army of the Muslims in Khorasan was overwhelmingly Arab. The unit organization of the Abbasids was designed with the goal of ethnic and racial equality among supporters. When Abu Muslim recruited officers along the Silk Road, he registered them based not on their tribal or ethno-national affiliations but on their current places of residence. Under the Abbasids, Iranian peoples became better represented in the army and bureaucracy as compared to before. The Abbasid army was centred on the Khorasan Abna al-dawla infantry and the Khurasaniyya heavy cavalry, led by their own semi-autonomous commanders () who recruited and deployed their own men with Abbasid resource grants. al-Mu‘tasim began the practice of recruiting Turkic slave soldiers from the Samanids into a private army, which allowed him to take over the reins of the caliphate. He abolished the old &quot;jund&quot; system created by Umar and diverted the salaries of the original Arab military descendants to the Turkic slave soldiers. The Turkic soldiers transformed the style of warfare, as they were known as capable horse archers, trained from childhood to ride. This military was now drafted from the ethnic groups of the faraway borderlands, and were completely separate from the rest of society. Some could not speak Arabic properly. This led to the decline of the caliphate starting with the Anarchy at Samarra.

Although the Abbasids never retained a substantial regular army, the caliph could recruit a considerable number of soldiers in a short time when needed from levies. There were also cohorts of regular troops who received steady pay and a special forces unit. At any moment, 125,000 Muslim soldiers could be assembled along the Byzantine frontier, Baghdad, Medina, Damascus, Rayy, and other geostrategic locations in order to quell any unrest.

The cavalry was entirely covered in iron, with helmets. Similar to medieval knights, their only exposed spots were the end of their noses and small openings in front of their eyes. Their foot soldiers were issued spears, swords, and pikes, and (in line with Persian fashion) trained to stand so solidly that, one contemporary wrote &quot;you would have thought them held fast by clamps of bronze&quot;.

The Abbasid army amassed an array of siege equipment, such as catapults, mangonels, battering rams, ladders, grappling irons, and hooks. All such weaponry was operated by military engineers. However, the primary siege weapon was the , a type of siege weapon that was comparable to the trebuchet employed in Western medieval times. From the seventh century onward, it had largely replaced torsion artillery. By Harun al-Rashid&#x27;s time, the Abbasid army employed fire grenades. The Abbasids also utilized field hospitals and ambulances drawn by camels.

==Civil administration==

As a result of such a vast Empire, the caliphate was decentralized and divided into 24 provinces.

Harun&#x27;s vizier enjoyed close to unchecked powers. Under Harun, a special &quot;bureau of confiscation&quot; was created. This governmental wing made it possible for the vizier to seize the property and riches of any corrupt governor or civil servant. In addition, it allowed governors to confiscate the estates of lower-ranking officials. Finally, the caliph could impose the same penalty on a vizier who fell from grace. As one later caliph put it: &quot;The vizier is our representative throughout the land and amongst our subjects. Therefore, he who obeys him obeys us; and he who obeys us obeys God, and God shall cause him who obeys Him to enter paradise.&quot;

Every regional metropolis had a post office and hundreds of roads were paved in order to link the imperial capital with other cities and towns. The empire employed a system of relays to deliver mail. The central post office in Baghdad even had a map with directions that noted the distances between each town. The roads were provided with roadside inns, hospices, and wells and could reach eastward through Persia and Central Asia, to as far as China. The post office not only enhanced civil services but also served as intelligence for the caliph. Mailmen were employed as spies who kept an eye on local affairs.

Early in the days of the caliphate, the Barmakids took the responsibility of shaping the civil service. The family had roots in a Buddhist monastery in northern Afghanistan. In the early 8th century, the family converted to Islam and began to take on a sizable part of the civil administration for the Abbasids.

Capital poured into the caliphate&#x27;s treasury from a variety of taxes, including a real estate tax; a levy on cattle, gold and silver, and commercial wares; a special tax on non-Muslims; and customs dues.

==Trade==
Under Harun, maritime trade through the Persian Gulf thrived, with Arab vessels trading as far south as Madagascar and as far east as China, Korea, and Japan. The growing economy of Baghdad and other cities inevitably led to the demand for luxury items and formed a class of entrepreneurs who organized long-range caravans for the trade and then the distribution of their goods. A whole section in the East Baghdad suq was dedicated to Chinese goods.

Arabs traded with the Baltic region and made it as far north as the British Isles. Tens of thousands of Arab coins have been discovered in parts of Russia and Sweden, which bear witness to the comprehensive trade networks set up by the Abbasids. King Offa of Mercia (in England) minted gold coins similar to those of the Abbasids in the eighth century.

Muslim merchants employed ports in Bandar Siraf, Basra, and Aden and some Red Sea ports to travel and trade with India and South East Asia. Land routes were also utilized through Central Asia. Arab businessmen were present in China as early as the eighth century. Arab merchants sailed the Caspian Sea to reach and trade with Bukhara and Samarkand.

Many caravans and goods never made it to their intended destinations. Some Chinese exports perished in fires, while other ships sank. It was said that anybody who made it to China and back unharmed was blessed by God. Common sea routes were also plagued by pirates who built and crewed vessels that were faster than most merchant ships. It is said that many of the adventures at sea in the Sinbad tales were based on historical fiction of mariners of the day.

The Abbasids also established overland trade with Africa, largely for gold and slaves. When trade with Europe ceased due to hostilities, Jews served as a link between the two hostile worlds.

The Abbasids engaged in extensive trade with the Italian maritime republics of Venice and Genoa, from the 11th century. Venetian merchants facilitated the exchange of high-value goods such as spices, silk, and precious metals from the East. In return, Venice exported European manufactured goods and luxury items. While Genoese merchants traded in luxury goods like spices, textiles, and other high-demand items. Genoa&#x27;s strategic position in the Mediterranean enabled it to integrate into the broader Mediterranean trade network, connecting the Abbasid Caliphate with other European markets. These trade relations played a key role in linking the medieval Mediterranean with the broader Islamic world. This exchange of goods, alongside cultural and technological transfers, fostered a more interconnected medieval global economy.

==List of caliphs==
==Dynasties claiming Abbasid descent==

Centuries after the &quot;Abbasids&quot; fall, several dynasties have claimed descent from them, as &quot;claiming kinship relation with Muhammad&quot;, that is, claiming an affiliation to the &#x27;People of the House&#x27; or the status of a sayyid or sharif, has arguably been the most widespread way in Muslim societies of supporting one&#x27;s moral or material objectives with genealogical credentials.&quot; Such claims of continuity with Muhammad or his Hashemite kin such as the Abbasids foster a sense of &quot;political viability&quot; for a candidate dynasty, with the intention of &quot;serving an internal audience&quot; (or in other words, gaining legitimacy in the view of the masses). The Wadai Empire which ruled parts of modern-day Chad and Sudan also claimed Abbasid descent, alongside the Khairpur and Bahawalpur states in Pakistan and the Khanate of Bastak.

A common trope among Abbasid claimant dynasties is that they are descended from Abbasid princes of Baghdad, &quot;dispersed&quot; by the Mongol invasion in 1258 CE. These surviving princes would leave Baghdad for a safe haven not controlled by the Mongols, assimilate to their new societies, and their descendants would grow to establish their own dynasties with their Abbasid &#x27;credentials&#x27; centuries later. This is highlighted by the origin myth of the Bastak khanate which relates that in 656 AH/1258 CE, the year of the fall of Baghdad, and following the sack of the city, a few surviving members of the Abbasid dynastic family led by the eldest amongst them, Ismail II son of Hamza son of Ahmed son of Mohamed migrated to Southern Iran, in the village of Khonj and later to Bastak where their khanate was established in the 17th century CE.

Meanwhile, the Wadai Empire related a similar origin story, claiming descent from a man by the name of Salih ibn Abdullah ibn Abbas, whose father Abdullah was an Abbasid prince who fled Baghdad for Hijaz upon the Mongol invasion. He had a son named Salih who would grow to become an &quot;able jurist&quot; and a &quot;very devout man&quot;. The Muslim ulama on pilgrimage in Mecca met him and, impressed by his knowledge, invited him to return with him to Sennar. Seeing the population&#x27;s deviation from Islam, he &quot;pushed further&quot; until he found the Abu Sinun mountain in Wadai where he converted the local people to Islam and taught them its rules, after which they made him sultan, thus laying the foundations of the Wadai Empire.

With regards to the Bastak khanate, Shaikh Mohamed Khan Bastaki was the first Abbasid ruler of Bastak to hold the title of &quot;Khan&quot; after the local people accepted him as a ruler, meaning &quot;ruler&quot; or &quot;king&quot;, a title which was reportedly bestowed upon him by Karim Khan Zand. The title then became that of all the subsequent Abbasid rulers of Bastak and Jahangiriyeh, and also collectively refers in plural form, i.e., &quot;Khans&quot;, to the descendants of Shaikh Mohamed Khan Bastaki. The last Abbasid ruler of Bastak and Jahangiriyeh was Mohamed A&#x27;zam Khan Baniabbassian son of Mohamed Reza Khan &quot;Satvat al-Mamalek&quot; Baniabbasi. He authored the book &quot;Tarikh-e Jahangiriyeh va Baniabbassian-e Bastak&quot; (1960), in which is recounted the history of the region and the Abbasid family that ruled it. Mohamed A&#x27;zam Khan Baniabbassian died in 1967, regarded as the end of the Abbasid reign in Bastak.

<doc id="49860" wikidata="Q826274" url="?curid=49860" title="Fauna of Australia">
<text>The fauna of Australia consists of a large variety of animals; some 46% of birds, 69% of mammals, 94% of amphibians, and 93% of reptiles that inhabit the continent are endemic to it. This high level of endemism can be attributed to the continent&#x27;s long geographic isolation, tectonic stability, and the effects of a unique pattern of climate change on the soil and flora over geological time. A unique feature of Australia&#x27;s fauna is the relative scarcity of native placental mammals. Consequently, the marsupials – a group of mammals that raise their young in a pouch, including the macropods, possums and dasyuromorphs – occupy many of the ecological niches placental animals occupy elsewhere in the world. Australia is home to two of the five known extant species of monotremes and has numerous venomous species, which include the platypus, spiders, scorpions, octopus, jellyfish, molluscs, stonefish, and stingrays. Uniquely, Australia has more venomous than non-venomous species of snakes.

The settlement of Australia by Indigenous Australians between 48,000 and 70,000 years ago and by Europeans from 1788, has significantly affected the fauna. Hunting, the introduction of non-native species, and land-management practices involving the modification or destruction of habitats have led to numerous extinctions. Based on the list of Australian animals extinct in the Holocene, about 33 mammals (27 from the mainland, including the thylacine), 24 birds (three from the mainland), one reptile, and three frog species or subspecies are strongly believed to have become extinct in Australia during the Holocene epoch. These figures exclude dubious taxa like the Roper River scrub robin (&quot;Drymodes superciliaris colcloughi&quot;) and possibly extinct taxa like the Christmas Island shrew (&quot;Crocidura trichura&quot;). Unsustainable land use still threatens the survival of many species. To target threats to the survival of its fauna, Australia has passed wide-ranging federal and state legislation and established numerous protected areas.

==Origins and history==
Both geologic and climatic events helped to make Australia&#x27;s fauna unique. Australia was once part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, which also included South America, Africa, India and Antarctica. Gondwana began to break up 140 million years ago (MYA); 50 MYA Australia separated from Antarctica and was relatively isolated until the collision of the Indo-Australian Plate with Asia in the Miocene epoch 5.3 MYA. The establishment and evolution of the present-day fauna was apparently shaped by the unique climate and the geology of the continent. As Australia drifted, it was, to some extent, isolated from the effects of global climate change. The unique fauna that originated in Gondwana, such as the marsupials, survived and adapted in Australia.

After the Miocene, fauna of Asian origin were able to establish themselves in Australia. The Wallace Line — the hypothetical line separating the zoogeographical regions of Asia and Australasia — marks the tectonic boundary between the Eurasian and Indo-Australian plates. This continental boundary prevented the formation of land bridges and resulted in a distinct zoological distribution, with limited overlap, of most Asian and Australian fauna, with the exception of birds. Following the emergence of the circumpolar current in the mid-Oligocene era (some 15 MYA), the Australian climate became increasingly arid, giving rise to a diverse group of arid-specialised organisms, just as the wet tropical and seasonally wet areas gave rise to their own uniquely adapted species.

==Mammals==
Australia has a rich mammalian fossil history, as well as a variety of extant mammalian species, dominated by the marsupials, currently however there is limited taxonomic research into Australia&#x27;s mammals. The fossil record shows that monotremes have been present in Australia since the Early Cretaceous 145–99 MYA, and that marsupials and placental mammals date from the Eocene 56–34 MYA, when modern mammals first appeared in the fossil record. Although terrestrial marsupials and placental mammals did coexist in Australia in the Eocene, only the marsupials have survived to the present. Non-volant placental mammals made their reappearance in Australia in the Miocene, when Australia moved closer to Indonesia, and rodents started to appear reliably in the Late Miocene fossil record. The marsupials evolved to fill specific ecological niches, and in many cases they are physically similar to the placental mammals in Eurasia and North America that occupy similar niches, a phenomenon known as convergent evolution. For example, the top predator in Australia, the thylacine, bore a striking resemblance to canids. Gliding possums and flying squirrels have similar adaptations enabling their arboreal lifestyle; and the numbat and anteaters are both digging insectivores. For the most part, mammals are not a highly visible part of the faunal landscape, as most species are nocturnal and many arboreal.

===Monotremes and marsupials===

Two of the five living species of monotreme occur in Australia: the platypus and the short-beaked echidna, the other three being echidnas that only occur in New Guinea. Monotremes differ from other mammals in their methods of reproduction; in particular, they lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. The platypus — a venomous, egg-laying, duck-billed amphibious mammal — is considered to be one of the strangest creatures in the animal kingdom. When it was first presented by Joseph Banks to English naturalists it was thought to be a hoax. The short-beaked echidna is covered in hairy spikes with a tubular snout in the place of a mouth, and a tongue that can move in and out of the snout at a rate of 100 times a minute to capture termites.

Australia has the world&#x27;s largest and most diverse range of marsupials. Marsupials are characterised by the presence of a pouch in which they rear their young after birth. The carnivorous marsupials — Dasyuromorphia — are represented by two surviving families: the Dasyuridae with 51 members, and the Myrmecobiidae with the numbat as its sole extant species. The Tasmanian tiger was the largest Dasyuromorphia and the last living specimen of the family Thylacinidae died in captivity in 1936. The world&#x27;s largest surviving carnivorous marsupial is the Tasmanian devil; it is the size of a small dog and can hunt, although it is mainly a scavenger. It became extinct on the mainland some 600 years ago, and is now found only in Tasmania. There are four species of quoll, or &quot;native cat&quot;, all of which are threatened species. The eastern quoll for example is believed to have been extinct on the mainland since the 1960s, though there are efforts to reintroduce it. The remainder of the Dasyuridae are referred to as &quot;marsupial mice&quot;; most weigh less than 100 g. There are two species of marsupial mole — order Notoryctemorphia — that inhabit the deserts of Western Australia. These rare, blind and earless carnivorous creatures spend most of their time underground; little is known about them.

The bandicoots and bilbies — order Peramelemorphia — are marsupial omnivores. There are seven extant species in Australia, most of which are endangered. These small creatures share several characteristic physical features: a plump, arch-backed body with a long, delicately tapering snout, large upright ears, long, thin legs, and a thin tail. The evolutionary origin of this group is unclear, because they share characteristics from both carnivorous and herbivorous marsupials.

Marsupials with two front teeth (diprotodont) on the lower jaw and syndactyly are classified in the order Diprotodontia, and further into the suborders Vombatiformes, Macropodiformes and Phalangerida. The Vombatiformes include the koala and the three species of wombat. One of Australia&#x27;s best-known marsupials, the koala is an arboreal species that feeds on the leaves of various species of eucalyptus. Wombats, on the other hand, live on the ground and feed on grasses, sedges and roots. Wombats use their diprotodont teeth and powerful claws to dig extensive burrow systems; they are mainly crepuscular and nocturnal.

The Phalangerida includes six families and 26 species of possum and three families with 53 species of macropod. The possums are a diverse group of arboreal marsupials and vary in size from the little pygmy possum, weighing just 7 g, to the cat-sized common ringtail and brushtail possums. The sugar and squirrel gliders are common species of gliding possum, found in the eucalypt forests of eastern Australia, while the feathertail glider is the smallest glider species. The gliding possums have membranes called &quot;patagia&quot; that extend from the fifth finger of their forelimb back to the first toe of their hind foot. These membranes, when outstretched, allow them to glide between trees.

The macropods are divided into three families: the Hypsiprymnodontidae, with the musky rat-kangaroo as its only member; the Potoroidae, with 11 species; and the Macropodidae, with 45 species. Macropods are found in all Australian environments except alpine areas. The Potoroidae include the bettongs, potaroos and rat-kangaroos, small species that make nests and carry plant material with their tails. The Macropodiae include kangaroos, wallabies and associated species; size varies widely within this family. Most macropods have large hind legs and long, narrow hind feet, with a distinctive arrangement of four toes, and powerfully muscled tails, which they use to hop around. The musky rat-kangaroo is the smallest macropod and the only species that is quadrupedal not bipedal, while the male red kangaroo is the largest, reaching a height of about 2 m and weighing up to 85 kg.

===Placental mammals===

Australia has indigenous placental mammals from two orders: the bats — order Chiroptera — represented by six families; and the mice and rats — order Rodentia, family Muridae. There are only two endemic genera of bats, although 7% of the world&#x27;s bat species live in Australia. Rodents first arrived in Australia 5–10 MYA, undergoing a wide radiation to produce the species collectively known as the &quot;old endemic&quot; rodents. The old endemics are represented by 14 extant genera. A million years ago, the rat entered Australia from New Guinea and evolved into seven species of &quot;Rattus&quot;, collectively called the &quot;new endemics&quot;.

Since human settlement many additional placental mammals have been introduced to Australia and are now feral. The first placental mammal introduced to Australia was the dingo. Fossil evidence suggests that people from the north brought the dingo to Australia about 5000 years ago. When Europeans settled Australia they intentionally released many species into the wild including the red fox, European hare, and the European rabbit. Other domestic species have escaped and over time have produced wild populations including the banteng, cat, fallow deer, red deer, sambar deer, rusa deer, chital, hog deer, horse, donkey, pig, goat, water buffalo, and the camel. Only three species of non-native placental mammal were not deliberately introduced to Australia: the house mouse, black rat and the brown rat.

Forty-six marine mammals from the order Cetacea are found in Australian coastal waters. Since the majority of these species have global distribution, some authors do not consider them to be Australian species. There are eleven species of baleen whale present; humpback whales, southern right whales, dwarf minke whales and pygmy blue whales are more commonly observed. There are 37 species of toothed whale, which include all six genera of the family Ziphiidae, and 21 species of oceanic dolphin, including the Australian snubfin dolphin, a species first described in 2005. Some oceanic dolphins, such as the orca, can be found in all waters around the continent; others, such as the Irrawaddy dolphin, are confined to the warm northern waters. The dugong is an endangered marine species that inhabits the waters of north-eastern and north-western Australia, particularly the Torres Strait. It can grow up to 3 m long and weigh as much as 400 kg. The dugong is the only herbivorous marine mammal in Australia, feeding on sea grass in coastal areas. The destruction of sea grass beds is a threat to the survival of this species. Eleven species of seal — family Pinnipedia — live off the southern coast.

==Birds==
Australia and its territories are home to around 800 species of bird; 45% of these are endemic to Australia. The fossil record of birds in Australia is patchy; however, there are records of the ancestors of contemporary species as early as the Late Oligocene. Birds with a Gondwanan history include the flightless ratites (the emu and southern cassowary), megapodes (the malleefowl and Australian brush-turkey), and a huge group of endemic parrots, order Psittaciformes. Australian parrots comprise a sixth of the world&#x27;s parrots, including many cockatoos and galahs. The kookaburra is the largest species of the kingfisher family, known for its call, which sounds uncannily like loud, echoing human laughter. The Brolga is the only crane exclusive to Australia, and it shares habitat with the more widely distributed Sarus Cranes.The passerines of Australia, also known as songbirds or perching birds, include wrens, robins, the magpie group, thornbills, pardalotes, the huge honeyeater family, treecreepers, lyrebirds, birds of paradise and bowerbirds. The satin bowerbird has attracted the interest of evolutionary psychologists; it has a complex courtship ritual in which the male creates a bower filled with blue, shiny items to woo mates.
Relatively recent colonists from Eurasia are swallows, larks, thrushes, cisticolas, sunbirds, and some raptors, including the large wedge-tailed eagle. A number of bird species have been introduced by humans; some, like the European goldfinch and greenfinch, coexist happily with Australian species, while others, such as the common starling, common blackbird, house sparrow and Indian mynah, are destructive of some native bird species and thus destabilise the native ecosystem.

About 200 species of seabird live on the Australian coast, including many species of migratory seabird. Australia is at the southern end of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway for migratory water birds, which extends from Far-East Russia and Alaska through Southeast Asia to Australia and New Zealand. About two million birds travel this route to and from Australia each year. One very common large seabird is the Australian pelican, which can be found in most waterways in Australia. The  Australian little penguin is the only species of penguin that breeds on mainland Australia.

==Amphibians and reptiles==
Australia has four families of native frogs and one introduced toad, the cane toad. In 1935 the cane toad was introduced to Australia in a failed attempt to control pests in sugarcane crops. It has since become a devastating pest, spreading across northern Australia. As well as competing with native insectivores for food, the cane toad produces a venom that is toxic to native fauna, as well as to humans. The Myobatrachidae, or southern frogs, are Australia&#x27;s largest group of frogs, with 112 species classified into anywhere from 17 to 22 genera. A notable member of this group is the colourful and endangered Corroboree frog. The tree frogs, from family Hylidae, are common in high rainfall areas on the north and east coasts; there are 77 Australian species from three genera. The 18 species from two genera of the Microhylidae frogs are restricted to the rainforests of northern Australia and nearby habitats; the smallest species, the scanty frog, is from this family. There is a single species from the world&#x27;s dominant frog group, family Ranidae – the Australian wood frog – which only occurs in the Queensland rainforests. As elsewhere, there has been a precipitous decline in Australia&#x27;s frog populations in recent years. Although the full reasons for the decline are uncertain, it can be at least partly attributed to the fatal amphibian fungal disease chytridiomycosis. Another theory for the decline might be, as research shows, that species from the Southern Hemisphere are on average 4.6 million years old, compared to an average 2.9 million years old for the Northern Hemisphere: Researchers believe this age difference is because of the history of severe ice ages in the Northern Hemisphere, which may drive older species to extinction.

Australia has two species of crocodile. The saltwater crocodile, known colloquially as the &quot;salty&quot;, is the largest living crocodile species; reaching over 7 m, and weighing over 1,000 kg, they can and do kill people. They live on the coast and in the freshwater rivers and wetlands of northern Australia, and they are farmed for their meat and leather. Freshwater crocodiles, found only in northern Australia, are not considered dangerous to humans.

The Australian coast is visited by six species of sea turtle: the flatback, green, hawksbill, olive ridley, loggerhead and the leatherback sea turtles; all are protected in Australian waters. There are 35 species of Australian freshwater turtles from eight genera of the family Chelidae. The pig-nosed turtle is the only Australian turtle not of that family. Australia is the only continent without any living species of land tortoises of the Testudinoidea superfamily besides Antarctica.
Australia is the only continent where venomous snakes outnumber their non-venomous cousins. Australian snakes belong to seven families. Of these, the most venomous species, including the fierce snake, eastern brown snake, taipan and eastern tiger snake are from the family Elapidae. Of the 200 species of elapid, 106 are found in Australia and 86 are found only in Australia. Thirty-three sea snakes from family Hydrophiidae inhabit Australia&#x27;s northern waters; many are extremely venomous. Two species of sea snake from the Acrochordidae also occur in Australian waters. Australia has only 11 species from the world&#x27;s most significant snake family Colubridae; none are endemic, and they are considered to be relatively recent arrivals from Asia. There are 15 python species and 45 species of insectivorous blind snake.

There are more species of snake in Darwin than any other Australian state capital, with 34 non-marine snake species found in the region, of which 23 have been recorded by professional snake catchers in Darwin itself. Fortunately for the citizens of Darwin, a far smaller proportion of these snakes are highly venomous than is typically found in other cities, due to the low numbers of front-fanged elapid species and dominance of relatively harmless pythons and colubrid species.
There are more than 700 species of lizards in Australia with representatives of five families. There are over 130 species in 20 genera of gecko found throughout the Australian continent. The Pygopodidae is a family of limbless lizards endemic to the Australian region; all 39 species from seven genera occur in Australia. The Agamidae or dragon lizards are represented by 70 species in 14 genera, including the thorny devil, bearded dragon and frill-necked lizard. There are 30 species of monitor lizard, family Varanidae, in Australia, where they are commonly known as goannas. The largest Australian monitor is the perentie, which can reach up to 2 m in length. There are about 450 species of skink from more than 40 genera, comprising more than 50% of the total Australian lizard fauna; this group includes the blue-tongued lizards.

==Fish==

More than 5000 species of fish inhabit Australia&#x27;s waterways; of these, 24% are endemic. However, because of the relative scarcity of freshwater waterways, Australia has only about 300 species of freshwater fish. Two families of freshwater fish have ancient origins: the arowana or bonytongues, and the Queensland lungfish. The Queensland lungfish is the most primitive of the lungfish, having evolved before Australia separated from Gondwana. One of the smallest freshwater fish, peculiar to the southwest of Western Australia, is the salamanderfish, which can survive desiccation in the dry season by burrowing into mud. Other families with a potentially Gondwanan origin include the Retropinnidae, Galaxiidae, Aplochitonidae and Percichthyidae. Apart from the ancient freshwater species, 70% of Australia&#x27;s freshwater fish have affinities with tropical Indo-Pacific marine species that have adapted to freshwater. These species include freshwater lampreys, Herrings, catfish, rainbowfish, and some 50 species of gudgeon, including the sleepy cod. Native freshwater game fish include the barramundi, Murray cod, and golden perch. Two species of endangered freshwater shark are found in the Northern Territory.
Several exotic freshwater fish species, including brown, brook and rainbow trout, Atlantic and Chinook salmon, redfin perch, common carp, and mosquitofish, have been introduced to Australian waterways. The mosquitofish is a particularly aggressive species known for harassing and nipping the fins of other fish. It has been linked to declines and localised extirpations of several small native fish species. The introduced trout species have had serious negative impacts on a number of upland native fish species including trout cod, Macquarie perch and mountain galaxias species as well as other upland fauna such as the spotted tree frog. The common carp is strongly implicated in the dramatic loss in waterweed, decline of small native fish species and permanently elevated levels of turbidity in the Murray-Darling Basin of south west Australia.

Most of Australia&#x27;s fish species are marine, and 75% live in tropical marine environments. This is partly due to Australia&#x27;s huge marine territory, covering 9 million km2. Groups of interest include the moray eels and squirrelfish, as well as the pipefish and seahorses, whose males incubate their partner&#x27;s eggs in a specialised pouch. There are 80 species of grouper in Australian waters, including one of the world&#x27;s biggest bony fish, the giant grouper, which can grow as large as 2.7 m and weigh up to 400 kg. The trevally, a group of 50 species of silver schooling fish, and the snappers are popular species for commercial fishing. The Great Barrier Reef supports a huge variety of small- and medium-sized reef fish, including the damselfish, butterflyfish, angelfish, gobies, cardinalfish, wrassees, triggerfish and surgeonfish. There are several venomous fish, among them several species of stonefish and pufferfish and the red lionfish, all of which have toxins that can kill humans. There are 11 venomous species of stingray, the largest of which is the smooth stingray. The barracudas are one of the reef&#x27;s largest species. However, large reef fish should not be eaten for fear of ciguatera poisoning.
Sharks inhabit all the coastal waters and estuarine habitats of Australia&#x27;s coast. There are 166 species, including 30 species of requiem shark, 32 of catshark, six of wobbegong shark, and 40 of dogfish shark. There are three species from the family Heterodontidae: the Port Jackson shark, the zebra bullhead shark and the crested bullhead shark. In 2004, there were 12 unprovoked shark attacks in Australia, of which two were fatal. Only 3 species of shark pose a significant threat to humans: the bull shark, the tiger shark and the great white shark. Some popular beaches in Queensland and New South Wales are protected by shark netting, a method that has reduced the population of both dangerous and harmless shark species through accidental entanglement. The overfishing of sharks has also significantly reduced shark numbers in Australian waters, and several species are now endangered. A megamouth shark was found on a Perth beach in 1988; very little is known about this species, but this discovery may indicate the presence of the species in Australian coastal waters.

==Invertebrates==
Of the estimated 200,000 animal species in Australia, about 96% are invertebrates. While the full extent of invertebrate diversity is uncertain, 90% of insects and molluscs are considered endemic. Invertebrates occupy many ecological niches and are important in all ecosystems as decomposers, pollinators, and food sources. The largest group of invertebrates is the insects, comprising 75% of Australia&#x27;s known species of animals. The most diverse insect orders are the Coleoptera, with 28,200 species of beetles and weevils, the Lepidoptera with 20,816 species including butterflies and moths, and around 14,800 species of Hymenoptera, including the ants, bees and wasps. Order Diptera, which includes the flies and mosquitoes, comprises 7,786 species. Order Hemiptera, including bugs, aphids and hoppers, comprises 5,650 species; and there are 2,827 species of order Orthoptera, including grasshoppers, crickets and katydids. Introduced species that pose a significant threat to native species include the European wasp, the red fire ant, the yellow crazy ant and feral honeybees which compete with native bees.

Australia has a wide variety of arachnids, including 78 spider families with 79 species of spider familiar enough to have common names. There are numerous highly venomous species, including the notorious Sydney funnel-web and allied mygalomorphs, whose bites can be deadly. The redback spider was thought to be deadly but redback bites are no longer thought to be life-threatening, as the lack of deaths since 1956 was thought to be due to the development of an anti-venom which has since been shown to be no better than placebo. There are thousands of species of mites and ticks from the subclass Acari. Australia also has at least 150 species of pseudoscorpion with an estimated 550 more waiting to be described, and at least 17 scorpion genera with 120 species.

In the Annelida (sub)class Oligochaeta there are many families of aquatic worms, and for native terrestrial worms: the Enchytraeidae (pot worms) and the &quot;true&quot; earthworms in families Acanthodrilidae, Octochaetidae and Megascolecidae. The latter includes the world&#x27;s largest earthworm, the giant Gippsland earthworm, found only in Gippsland, Victoria. On average they reach 80 cm in length, but specimens up to 3.7 m in length have been found.

The large family Parastacidae includes 124 species of Australian freshwater crayfish. These include the world&#x27;s smallest crayfish, the swamp crayfish, which does not exceed 30 mm in length, and the world&#x27;s largest crayfish, the Tasmanian giant freshwater crayfish, measuring up to 76 cm long and weighing 4.5 kg. The crayfish genus &quot;Cherax&quot; includes the common yabby, in addition to the farmed species marron and Queensland red claw. Species from the genus &quot;Engaeus&quot;, commonly known as the land crayfish, are also found in Australia. &quot;Engaeus&quot; species are not entirely aquatic, because they spend most of their lives living in burrows. Australia has seven species of freshwater crab from the genus &quot;Austrothelphusa&quot;. These crabs live burrowed into the banks of waterways and can plug their burrows, surviving through several years of drought. The extremely primitive freshwater mountain shrimp, found only in Tasmania, are a unique group, resembling species found in the fossil record from 200 MYA.

A huge variety of marine invertebrates are found in Australian waters, with the Great Barrier Reef an important source of this diversity. Families include the Porifera or sea sponges, the Cnidaria (includes the jellyfish, corals and sea anemones, comb jellies), the Echinodermata (includes the sea urchins, sea stars, brittle stars, sea cucumbers, the lamp shells) and the Mollusca (includes snails, slugs, limpets, squid, octopus, cockles, oysters, clams, and chitons). Venomous invertebrates include the box jellyfish, the blue-ringed octopus, and ten species of cone snail, which can cause respiratory failure and death in humans. The crown-of-thorns starfish usually inhabits the reef at low densities. However, under conditions that are not yet well understood, they can reproduce to reach an unsustainable population density when coral is devoured at a rate faster than it can regenerate. This presents a serious reef management issue. Other problematic marine invertebrates include the native species purple sea urchin and the white urchin, which have been able to take over marine habitats and form urchin barrens due to the over harvesting of their natural predators which include abalone and rock lobster. Introduced invertebrate pests include the Asian mussel, New Zealand green-lipped mussel, black-striped mussel and the northern Pacific seastar, all of which displace native shellfish.

There are many unique marine crustaceans in Australian waters. The best-known class, to which all the edible species of crustacean belong, is Malacostraca. The warm waters of northern Australia are home to many species of decapod crustaceans, including crabs, false crabs, hermit crabs, lobsters, shrimps, and prawns. The peracarids, including the amphipods and isopods, are more diverse in the colder waters of southern Australia. Less-well-known marine groups include the classes Remipedia, Cephalocarida, Branchiopoda, Maxillopoda (which includes the barnacles, copepods and fish lice), and the Ostracoda. Notable species include the Tasmanian giant crab, the second largest crab species in the world, found in deep water, and weighing up to 13 kg, and the Australian spiny lobsters, such as the western rock lobster, which are distinct from other lobster species as they do not have claws.

==Invasive species==
Introduction of exotic fauna in Australia by design, accident and natural processes has led to a considerable number of invasive, feral and pest species which have flourished and now impact the environment adversely. Introduced organisms affect the environment in a number of ways. Rabbits render land economically useless by eating everything. Red foxes affect local endemic fauna by predation while the cane toad poisons the predators by being eaten. Some water fleas may have been introduced to Australia by humans or birds. Other invasive species include birds (Indian mynah), fish (common carp), insects (red imported fire ant), molluscs (Asian mussel). The problem is compounded by invasive exotic flora as well as introduced diseases, fungi and parasites. An example of this is Blue Green Algae, which is spreading through many bodies of water in rural Victoria, such as the Gippsland Lakes.

Costly, laborious and time-consuming efforts at control of these species has met with little success and this continues to be a major problem area in the conservation of Australia&#x27;s biodiversity.

Many of the introduced species are not regulated through wildlife services and can be regularly hunted year round. Some states even fund hunting initiatives though the efficacy of these programs are disputed.

According to a 2023 report co-authored by biologist Tim Low, invasive species are the leading cause of native Australian animal extinctions since the 1960s.

==Human impact and conservation==
For at least 40,000 years, Australia&#x27;s fauna played an integral role in the traditional lifestyles of Indigenous Australians, who relied upon many species as a source of food and skins. Vertebrates commonly harvested included macropods, possums, seals, fish and the short-tailed shearwater, most commonly known as the muttonbird. Invertebrates used as food included insects such as the bogong moth and larvae collectively called witchetty grubs and molluscs. The use of fire-stick farming, in which large swathes of bushland were burnt to facilitate hunting, modified both flora and fauna – and are thought to have contributed to the extinction of large herbivores with a specialised diet, such as the flightless birds from the genus &quot;Genyornis&quot;. The role of hunting and landscape modification by aboriginal people in the extinction of the Australian megafauna is debated, but increasingly favours the idea humans were responsible for megafaunal extinction.
Despite the major impact of Aboriginals on native species populations, this is considered to be less significant than that of the European settlers, whose impact on the landscape has been on a relatively large scale. Since European settlement, direct exploitation of native fauna, habitat destruction and the introduction of exotic predators and competitive herbivores has led to the extinction of some 27 mammal, 23 bird and 4 frog species. Much of Australia&#x27;s fauna is protected by legislation. The federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 was created to meet Australia&#x27;s obligations as a signatory to the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity. This act protects all native fauna and provides for the identification and protection of threatened species. In each state and territory, there is statutory listing of threatened species. At present, 380 animal species are classified as either endangered or threatened under the EPBC Act, and other species are protected under state and territory legislation. More broadly, a complete cataloguing of all the species within Australia has been undertaken, a key step in the conservation of Australian fauna and biodiversity. In 1973, the federal government established the Australian Biological Resources Study (ABRS), which coordinates research in the taxonomy, identification, classification and distribution of flora and fauna. The ABRS maintains free online databases cataloguing much of the described Australian flora and fauna. Impacts such as the illegal setting of traps in rivers affect animals such as the Australian platypus, along with lack of awareness each year an average of 2–5 Australians lose their lives to what is presumed a safe creature. The key is understanding of Australia&#x27;s diverse wildlife and fauna; what seems safe is often deadly.

The Australian Wildlife Conservancy is the largest private owner of land for conservation in the country which is dedicated to protecting endangered species across 4.8 million hectares of land in the most popular regions such as the Kimberley, Cape York, Lake Eyre and the Top End. This not-for-profit organisation is working hard to avoid extinction of the endangered native species in various wildlife sanctuaries.

Australia is a member of the International Whaling Commission and is strongly opposed to commercial whaling — all cetacean species are protected in Australian waters. Australia is also a signatory to the CITES agreement and prohibits the export of endangered species. Protected areas have been created in every state and territory to protect and preserve the country&#x27;s unique ecosystems. These protected areas include national parks and other reserves, as well as 64 wetlands registered under the Ramsar Convention and 16 World Heritage Sites. , 10.8% (774,619.51 km2) of the total land area of Australia is within protected areas. Protected marine zones have been created in many areas to preserve marine biodiversity; , these areas cover about 7% (646,000 km2) of Australia&#x27;s marine jurisdiction. The Great Barrier Reef is managed by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority under specific federal and state legislation. Some of Australia&#x27;s fisheries are already overexploited, and quotas have been set for the sustainable harvest of many marine species.

The &quot;State of the Environment Report, 2001&quot;, prepared by independent researchers for the federal government, concluded that the condition of the environment and environmental management in Australia had worsened since the previous report in 1996. Of particular relevance to wildlife conservation, the report indicated that many processes — such as salinity, changing hydrological conditions, land clearing, fragmentation of ecosystems, poor management of the coastal environment, and invasive species — pose major problems for protecting Australia&#x27;s biodiversity.

<text>Alexandra Feodorovna (; – 17 July 1918), born Princess Alix of Hesse and by Rhine, was the last Empress of Russia as the consort of Tsar Nicholas II from their marriage on until his forced abdication on . A granddaughter of Queen Victoria, Alexandra was one of the most famous royal carriers of hemophilia and passed the condition to her son, Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia.

Alexandra was deeply involved in the personal and political life of her husband, Tsar Nicholas II. Her reputation suffered due to her influence over Nicholas, particularly in her insistence on maintaining autocratic rule in the face of growing revolutionary pressures in Russia. Her relationship with the Russian mystic Grigori Rasputin became a subject of controversy. Rasputin&#x27;s alleged ability to alleviate Alexei&#x27;s suffering from hemophilia increased Alexandra&#x27;s reliance on him, damaging the public perception of the Romanovs and fueling rumors about Rasputin&#x27;s power within the royal family. These associations with Rasputin and her opposition to political reform were seen as contributing factors to the collapse of the Romanov dynasty.

Following Nicholas II&#x27;s abdication, the royal family were placed under house arrest by the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution. On 17 July 1918, they were executed by Bolshevik forces in Yekaterinburg, marking the violent end of over three centuries of Romanov rule. Despite her unpopularity during her reign, Alexandra was canonized as &quot;Saint Alexandra the Passion Bearer&quot; by the Russian Orthodox Church in 2000.

==Early life==

Alexandra was born on 6 June 1872 at the New Palace in Darmstadt as Princess &quot;Alix Viktoria Helene Luise Beatrix&quot; of Hesse and by Rhine, a grand duchy then part of the German Empire. She was the sixth child and fourth daughter among the seven children of Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse, and his first wife, Princess Alice of the United Kingdom, the second daughter of Queen Victoria.

Alix was baptized on 1 July 1872 (her parents&#x27; tenth wedding anniversary) in the Protestant Lutheran Church and given the names of her mother and each of her mother&#x27;s four sisters, some of which were transliterated into German. Her mother wrote to Queen Victoria, &quot;&#x27;Alix&#x27; we gave for &#x27;Alice&#x27; as they murder my name here: &#x27;Ali-ice&#x27; they pronounce it, so we thought &#x27;Alix&#x27; could not so easily be spoilt.&quot; Her mother gave her the nickname of &quot;Sunny&quot;, due to her cheerful disposition, a name adopted later by her husband. Her British relatives nicknamed her as &quot;Alicky&quot;, to distinguish her from her aunt-by-marriage, Alexandra, Princess of Wales, who was known within the family as Alix.

Alix&#x27;s godparents were the Prince and Princess of Wales (her maternal uncle and aunt), Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom (her maternal aunt), the Duchess of Cambridge (her great-great-aunt), the Tsesarevich and Tsesarevna of Russia (her future parents-in-law), and Princess Anna of Prussia.

Alix&#x27;s older brother Prince Friedrich of Hesse and by Rhine (&quot;Frittie&quot;) suffered from hemophilia and died in May 1873 after a fall, when Alix was about one year old. Of her siblings, Alix was closest to Princess Marie (&quot;May&quot;), who was two years younger; they were noted as &quot;inseparable&quot;.

In November 1878, diphtheria swept through the House of Hesse; Alix, her three sisters, her brother Ernst (&quot;Ernie&quot;), and their father fell ill. Elisabeth (&quot;Ella&quot;), Alix&#x27;s older sister, was visiting their paternal grandmother, and escaped the outbreak. Alix&#x27;s mother Alice tended to the children herself, rather than abandon them to nurses and doctors. Alice fell ill and died on 14 December 1878, when Alix was six years old. This was the 17th anniversary of Alice&#x27;s own father&#x27;s death. Marie also died, but the rest of the siblings survived. She described her childhood before the deaths of her mother and sister as &quot;unclouded, happy babyhood, of perpetual sunshine, then of a great cloud&quot;.
Queen Victoria doted on the motherless Alix and became a surrogate mother to her. She felt highly protective of Alix and declared that &quot;while I live Alicky, til she is married, will be more than ever my own child.&quot; She handpicked Alix&#x27;s tutors and instructed them to send detailed reports back to Windsor every month. She invited Alix and her surviving siblings to England for their holidays, and they grew close to their British cousins. Every birthday and Christmas, she sent Alix gifts of dresses, jewelry, lace, and dolls. Alix signed herself &quot;your loving and grateful child,&quot; rather than grandchild, in her letters. Alix reflected that she saw Queen Victoria as &quot;the best and dearest of grandmamas,&quot; &quot;a very august person,&quot; &quot;a Santa Clause,&quot; and &quot;the dearest and kindest Woman alive.&quot; When she was betrothed to Nicholas, Alix assured Victoria that &quot;my marrying will [not] make a difference to my love for You.&quot; When Queen Victoria died in 1901, Alix openly wept at her memorial service in Saint Petersburg and shocked the Russian courtiers who considered her cold and unfeeling.

Along with her sister, Princess Irene, Alix was a bridesmaid at the 1885 wedding of her godmother and maternal aunt, Princess Beatrice, to Prince Henry of Battenberg. At the age of 15, she attended Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee celebrations in 1887.
In March 1892, when Alix was nineteen years old, her father Grand Duke Louis IV, died of a heart attack. According to her biographer, Baroness Buxhoeveden, Alix regarded the death of her father as the greatest sorrow of her life. Buxhoeveden recalled in her 1928 biography that &quot;for years she could not speak of him, and long after when she was in Russia, anything that reminded her of him would bring her to the verge of tears&quot;.

==Proposed matches==
Queen Victoria greatly favored Alix and she wanted Alix to become the queen consort of the United Kingdom, which she considered &quot;the greatest position there is.&quot; On 2 March 1888, she wrote to Alix&#x27;s oldest sister Victoria that &quot;My heart and mind are bent on securing dear Alicky for either Eddy or Georgie&quot;, respectively the second in line to the British throne and his brother, the future George V, both of whom were Alexandra&#x27;s first cousins. In 1889, Victoria invited Alix and Eddy to Balmoral in hopes that they would fall in love. Eddy grew infatuated with her and proposed, but Alix was not interested in him and rejected his proposal. However, Victoria still persisted and tried to convince Alix of the benefits of the match. Victoria wrote to Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine, Alix&#x27;s older sister, that Alix &quot;should be made to reflect seriously on the folly of throwing away the chance of a very good husband, kind, affectionate and steady, and of entering a united happy family and a very good position which is second to none in the world!&quot; Alix&#x27;s older sister Ella opposed the match because &quot;he [Eddy] does not look over strong and is too stupid.&quot; In May 1890, Alix wrote a letter to Eddy that although it &quot;pained her to pain him,&quot; she only saw him as a cousin and could not marry him. She wrote to Victoria that she would marry Eddy if she were &quot;forced&quot; by the family but that both of them would be miserable. Victoria was disappointed, but she decided that Alix had shown &quot;great strength of character&quot; in refusing to acquiesce to such strong pressure.

In 1891, Queen Victoria tried to arrange a match between Alix and Prince Maximilian of Baden. She asked Louis to invite the prince to Darmstadt as soon as possible. When he arrived in Darmstadt, Maximilian told Alix that he intended to propose to her. Alix was surprised and unhappy, and she later reflected that &quot;I did not know him at all.&quot; She asked her older sister Victoria to intervene and help her reject Maximilian politely.

==Engagement==

In 1884, Alix attended the wedding of her sister Elisabeth to Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich in St. Petersburg. At this wedding, the 12-year-old Alix met the 16-year-old Tsesarevich Nicholas, nephew of the groom and heir-apparent to the Imperial throne of Russia. In his diary Nicholas called Alix &quot;sweet little Alix&quot; and declared &quot;we love each other.&quot; He gave her a brooch as a sign of his affection, and they scratched their names into a windowpane.

In January 1890, Alix visited her sister Ella in Russia. She and Nicholas skated together, met at tea parties, and played badminton. Nicholas wrote in his diary: &quot;It is my dream to one day marry Alix H. I have loved her for a long time, but more deeply and strongly since 1889 when she spent six weeks in Petersburg. For a long time, I have resisted my feeling that my dearest dream will come true.&quot;

Alix&#x27;s sister Ella and her husband Sergei were enthusiastically in favor of the match between Nicholas and Alix. Ella and Alix&#x27;s uncle, the future King Edward VII, told his mother, Queen Victoria, that &quot;Ella will move heaven and earth to get [Alix] to marry a Grand Duke.&quot; Ella wrote to Ernest, &quot;God grant this marriage will come true.&quot;

Nicholas and Alix were second cousins through Wilhelmina of Baden, the mother of both Nicholas&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Empress Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, formerly Princess Wilhelmine Marie of Hess-Darmstadt, the first wife of Tsar Alexander II, and Alix&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Prince Charles of Hesse and by Rhine, brother of Louis III, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine.

Queen Victoria opposed the match to Nicholas. She personally liked Nicholas, but she disliked Russia and Nicholas&#x27;s father and worried that Alix would not be safe in Russia. She wrote to Alix&#x27;s older sister Victoria of her suspicions that Sergei and Ella were encouraging the match. After the betrothal was announced, she reflected: &quot;The more I think of sweet Alicky&#x27;s marriage the more unhappy I am. Not as to the personality for I like [Nicholas] very much but on account of the country and the awful insecurity to which that poor child will be exposed.&quot;

Alexander and Maria Feodorovna were both vehemently anti-German and did not want Alix as a daughter-in-law. Maria Feodorovna told her sister Alexandra of Denmark that the youngest daughter of an undistinguished grand duke was not worthy to marry the heir to the Russian throne, and she believed that Alix was too tactless and unlikeable to be a successful empress. Alexander favored Princess Hélène of Orléans, the tall, dark-haired daughter of Philippe, Comte de Paris, pretender to the throne of France. Nicholas was not attracted to Hélène, writing in his diary: &quot;Mama made a few allusions to Hélène, daughter of the Comte de Paris. I myself want to go in one direction and it is evident that Mama wants me to choose the other one.&quot; Hélène also resisted this match, as she was Roman Catholic and her father refused to allow her to convert to Russian Orthodoxy. Alexander sent emissaries to Princess Margaret of Prussia, sister of Wilhelm II, German Emperor, and a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. Nicholas declared that he would rather become a monk than marry Margaret; she in turn was unwilling to convert to the Russian Orthodox Church from being Protestant.

When his health failed in 1894, Alexander III decided to allow Nicholas to marry Alix so that he could secure the succession. Maria reluctantly permitted Nicholas to propose to Alix. Nicholas was ecstatic and immediately inquired about Alix.

Despite her love for Nicholas, Alix was initially reluctant to marry Nicholas because she did not want to renounce her Lutheran faith to join the Orthodox Church. She wrote to Nicholas that &quot;I cannot [convert to Orthodoxy] against my conscience&quot; because &quot;What happiness can come from a marriage which begins without the real blessing of God?&quot; Nicholas was devastated, but he remained hopeful because Ella assured him that Alix was &quot;utterly miserable&quot; and had a &quot;deep and pure&quot; love for him. Nicholas begged her &quot;not [to] say &#x27;no&#x27; directly&quot; and declared, &quot;Do you think there can exist any happiness in the whole world without you!&quot;

In April 1894 Alix&#x27;s brother Ernest Louis married Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Princess Victoria was Alexander III&#x27;s niece by his sister Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia and Nicholas&#x27;s first cousin, so several Russians attended the wedding, including Grand Dukes Vladimir, Sergei and Paul, Grand Duchesses Elisabeth Feodorovna and Maria Pavlovna, and Nicholas. Nicholas was determined to persuade Alix to marry him. He was evidently confident in his future success: he brought Father Ioann Yanyshev, confessor to the Imperial family, to teach Alix about Russian Orthodoxy, and he brought Ekaterina Adolfovna Schneider to teach Alix Russian.

The day after his arrival in Coburg Nicholas proposed to Alix and tried for two hours to persuade her to convert to Orthodoxy. She wept continuously but refused. Ella spoke to Alix afterwards and she convinced Alix that she did not need to renounce Lutheranism to convert to Orthodoxy. Ella herself had not been required to abjure her Lutheran faith when she converted to Orthodoxy. The next day Alix spoke to Wilhelm II (who hoped that a German empress would lead to better German-Russian relations) and Duchess Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (a German princess who had converted from Lutheranism to Orthodoxy to marry Nicholas&#x27;s uncle Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia). She accepted Nicholas&#x27;s second proposal.

Following the engagement Alix returned to England and her grandmother. In June Nicholas travelled to England to visit her and attend the christening of the eldest son of Prince George, Duke of York. Alix and Nicholas were both named as godparents of the boy, who reigned briefly as Edward VIII of the United Kingdom in 1936. Alix wrote to her old governess that &quot;I am more happy than words can express. At last, after these five sad years!&quot; Nicholas declared that &quot;my soul was brimming with joy and life.&quot;

In September, as Alexander III&#x27;s health declined, Nicholas obtained the permission of his dying father to summon Alix to the Romanovs&#x27; Livadia Palace in Crimea. Escorted by her sister Ella from Warsaw to the Crimea, she traveled by ordinary passenger train. The dying tsar insisted on receiving Alix in full dress uniform and gave her his blessing.

==Empress of Russia==
===Wedding===

On 1 November 1894, Alexander III died at the age of 49. Nicholas was confirmed as Tsar Nicholas II. The next day, Alix was received into the Russian Orthodox Church as &quot;the truly believing Grand Duchess Alexandra Feodorovna.&quot; However, she was not required to repudiate Lutheranism. Alix wanted to take the name &quot;Yekaterina&quot;, but Nicholas wanted her to take the name Alexandra so that they could be a second Nicholas and Alexandra. He was inspired by his great-grandfather Nicholas I and his great-grandmother Alexandra Feodorovna.

Alexandra, the Prince and Princess of Wales, and Nicholas&#x27;s Greek relatives accompanied the coffin of Alexander III first through Moscow and St. Petersburg. The funeral of Alexander III occurred on 19 November.

On 26 November 1894, Alexandra and Nicholas married in the Grand Church of the Winter Palace of Saint Petersburg. Court mourning could be relaxed because it was the birthday of Nicholas&#x27;s mother, now Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna. Many Russians considered Alexandra a bad omen because she arrived so soon after the death of Emperor Alexander: &quot;She has come to us behind a coffin. She brings misfortune with her.&quot; Alexandra herself wrote to her sister: &quot;Our wedding seemed to me, a mere continuation of the funeral liturgy for the dead Tsar, with one difference; I wore a white dress instead of a black one.&quot;

===Coronation===
On 26 May 1896, Alexandra and Nicholas were crowned at the Dormition Cathedral in the Kremlin.

Five hundred thousand Russians gathered in Moscow to watch the entertainment, eat the court-sponsored food, and collect the gifts in honor of their new tsar. There were rumors that there was not enough food for everyone, so the crowd rushed towards the gift tables. The police failed to maintain order, and a thousand Russians were trampled to death at the Khodynka Field.

Nicholas and Alexandra were horrified by the deaths, and they decided not to attend the ball that the French ambassador, the Marquis de Montebello, hosted in their honor. Nicholas&#x27;s uncles urged him to attend so as not to offend the French and give credence to the rumors that the German Alexandra was prejudiced against the French. Sergei Witte commented, &quot;We expected the party would be called off. Instead it took place as if nothing had happened and the ball was opened by Their Majesties dancing a quadrille.&quot; The British ambassador informed Queen Victoria that &quot;the Empress appeared in great distress, her eyes reddened by tears.&quot;

The next day, Alexandra and Nicholas visited the wounded and paid for the coffins of the dead. However, many Russians took the disaster at Khodynka Field as an omen that Nicholas&#x27;s reign would be unhappy. Others used the circumstances of the tragedy and the behaviour of the royal establishment to underscore the heartlessness of the autocracy and the contemptible shallowness of the young tsar and his &quot;German woman&quot;.

===Rejection by the Russian people===

Alexandra was extremely unpopular among her husband&#x27;s Russian subjects. Her shy and introverted nature was interpreted as arrogance and coldness, and she struggled to win friends. The Russian court judged her as &quot;devoid of charm, wooden, cold eyes, holds herself as if she&#x27;d swallowed a yardstick.&quot;

Alexandra struggled to communicate. She spoke English and German fluently, but she is said to have struggled to speak French, the official language of the court. Her letters and notes show that she could read and write French very fluently however, and communication between herself and her children&#x27;s French tutor Pierre Gilliard was always in French. Alexandra also spoke Italian, having learned that language as a teenager.

It is often said that she struggled with Russian and did not learn it until she became Empress. This is however untrue. Her teenage diaries show that she had some Russian lessons prior to visiting her sister Ella in Russia. She began learning Russian in earnest after her engagement to Nicholas, and during the period of her engagement wrote long passages to him in Russian - with some minor errors, but improving over time. She learned to speak Russian very well. The letters between Alexandra and her son Alexei were almost without exception in Russian.

Alexandra failed to understand her public role at court as the empress. Traditionally, the empress led the social scene and hosted numerous balls. However, Alexandra was shocked by the decadence, love affairs, and gossip that characterized parties. She declared that &quot;the heads of the young ladies of St. Petersburg are filled with nothing but thoughts of young officers,&quot; and she crossed off the names of noblemen and noblewomen whom she deemed scandalous from the invitation lists until no one was left. Many people in St. Petersburg society dismissed Alexandra as a prude. In one of her first balls, Alexandra sent a lady-in-waiting to reprimand a young woman in a low-cut gown: &quot;Her Majesty wants me to tell you that in Hesse-Darmstadt we don&#x27;t wear our dresses this way.&quot; The unnamed woman replied, &quot;Pray tell Her Majesty that in Russia we do wear our dresses this way.&quot; In 1896, she launched the &quot;Help Through Handwork&quot; project. She wanted to create a series of workshops in which noblewomen would teach poor peasants how to sew and raise funds for needy families.

Alexandra had a difficult relationship with her mother-in-law, Maria Feodorovna. Unlike other European courts of the day, Russian protocol gave the dowager empress seniority in rank to the empress. At royal balls, Maria entered on her son&#x27;s arm and Alexandra followed on the arm of one of the grand dukes. Maria was so accustomed to the tradition that she was surprised when Alexandra was bitter about her junior role at court. Maria also &quot;carried her insistence on precedence so far that the &quot;chiffres&quot; of the maids of honor of both Empresses bore the initials M. A. instead of A. M., which was the proper order.&quot; The crown jewels were the property of the current Empress, but Maria initially refused to relinquish them to Alexandra. Maria begrudgingly surrendered the magnificent collection only after Alexandra threatened not to wear any jewels at all to official court events.

Alexandra was unpopular in the imperial family. She was a fervent advocate of the ‘divine right of kings’ and believed that it was unnecessary to attempt to secure the approval of the people, according to her aunt, German Empress Victoria, who wrote to Queen Victoria that &quot;Alix is very imperious and will always insist on having her own way; she will never yield one iota of power she will imagine she wields...&quot; She dreaded social functions and enjoyed being alone with Nicholas, so she did not host the balls and parties that a tsarina normally would. Members of the imperial family resented that she closed off their access to the tsar and the inner court. She disliked Nicholas&#x27;s uncle, Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich. She declared that Vladimir&#x27;s sons Kirill, Boris and Andrei were irredeemably immoral. In 1913 she refused Boris&#x27;s proposal for the hand of Grand Duchess Olga. During the war Vladimir&#x27;s wife, Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna, openly criticized Alexandra.

Insecure about her modest origins as a minor German princess, Alexandra insisted on being treated with the full honors due to an empress. In 1896 Alexandra and Nicholas went on a European tour. When Wilhelm II lent her an antique silver toilette service that had once belonged to his great-grandmother, Queen Louise of Prussia, she was insulted and declared that only a gold service was suitable for an empress. She dressed herself &quot;with great magnificence&quot;. At the Russian court courtiers mocked for her &quot;dress[ing] in the heavy brocade of which she was so fond, and with diamonds scattered all over her, in defiance of good taste and common sense.&quot;

Alexandra refused to court the public because she believed that the Russian people automatically loved and revered their emperor and empress. When she and Nicholas were traveling to Crimea by train, hundreds of peasants wore their best clothes and waited overnight to see the imperial couple. Nicholas went to the window and waved, but Alexandra refused to open the curtains and acknowledge the crowd. Dowager Empress Maria was furious that &quot;[Alexandra] thinks the Imperial family should be &#x27;above that sort of thing.&#x27; What does she mean? Above winning the people&#x27;s affection?...And yet, how often she complains of the public indifference toward her.&quot; Queen Victoria worried about Alexandra&#x27;s unpopularity in her new country and she advised her granddaughter: &quot;I&#x27;ve ruled more than 50 years ... and nevertheless every day I think about what I need to do to retain and strengthen the love of my subjects ... It is your first duty to win their love and respect.&quot; Alexandra replied, &quot;You are mistaken, my dear grandmamma; Russia is not England. Here we do not need to earn the love of the people. The Russian people revere their Tsars as divine beings ... As far as Petersburg society is concerned, that is something which one may wholly disregard.&quot;

===Struggle to bear an heir===
On 15 November 1895, Alexandra gave birth to her eldest child and daughter, Olga, at the Alexander Palace. Many Russians and members of the imperial family were disappointed in the sex of the child, but Nicholas and Alexandra were delighted with their daughter and doted on her. The birth of Olga did not change Grand Duke George&#x27;s position as Nicholas&#x27;s heir presumptive. The Pauline Laws implemented by Tsar Paul I forbade women from taking the Romanov throne as long as any male Romanov was alive. If Alexandra did not bear a son, Nicholas&#x27;s heirs would be his brothers and uncles. However few worried because Alexandra was only 23, so she was expected to be able to bear a son soon.

A few months after giving birth to Olga Alexandra was pregnant again. Owing to the stress of the coronation she had a miscarriage. No announcement was made, because she had not publicly confirmed her pregnancy. However there were unfounded and malicious rumors in St Petersburg that Alexandra had become pregnant by a lover and aborted the baby to hide her infidelity.

On 10 June 1897 Alexandra gave birth to her second child and daughter, Tatiana. Nicholas was overjoyed but the members of his family were unhappy and worried. When she woke up from the chloroform, Alexandra saw the &quot;anxious and troubled faces&quot; around her and &quot;burst into loud hysterics.&quot; She cried, &quot;My God, it is again a daughter. What will the nation say, what will the nation say?&quot; Alexandra&#x27;s failure to have a son made her even more unpopular among the Russians. Nicholas&#x27;s brother George said that he was disappointed not to have a nephew to relieve him of his duties as heir: &quot;I was already preparing to go into retirement, but it was not to be.

On 26 June 1899 Alexandra gave birth to her third child and daughter, Maria. Queen Victoria sent Alexandra a telegram when Maria was born: &quot;I am so thankful that dear Alicky has recovered so well, but I regret the third girl for the country.&quot; Grand Duke Konstantin fretted: &quot;And so there&#x27;s no Heir. The whole of Russia will be disappointed by this news.&quot; Russians saw the birth of a third daughter as proof that Alexandra was bad luck. Two weeks after Maria&#x27;s birth, Nicholas&#x27;s brother George died and their younger brother Michael became the heir presumptive to the throne. Courtiers flocked to Michael and treated him as the heir apparent, which distressed Alexandra. In October 1900 Nicholas became ill with abdominal typhus and was confined to bed for five weeks. The cabinet were forced to discuss what would happen if Nicholas died. Alexandra was pregnant with her fourth child, and she insisted that she be named regent in the hope that she would bear a son. However Nicholas&#x27;s ministers refused: If Nicholas died, Michael would become tsar. If Alexandra&#x27;s baby was a boy, Michael would renounce the throne in his nephew&#x27;s favor. Alexandra was not satisfied and she grew to distrust Nicholas&#x27;s ministers for trying to &quot;steal&quot; her future son&#x27;s inheritance.

On 18 June 1901 Alexandra gave birth to Anastasia. Nicholas&#x27;s sister, Grand Duchess Xenia, exclaimed, &quot;My God! What a disappointment!… a fourth girl!&quot; The French diplomat Maurice Paléologue reported: &quot;The German [Alexandra] has the evil eye. Thanks to her nefarious influence our Emperor is doomed to catastrophe.&quot; The Russian peasants decided that &quot;the Empress was not beloved in heaven or she would have borne a son.&quot;

Alexandra and Nicholas turned to the faith in hopes of having a son. Shortly after Anastasia&#x27;s birth, Grand Duchess Militza Nikolaevna introduced Alexandra to a mystic named Philippe Nizier-Vachot. He was an unlicensed quack who claimed that he could use his magnetic powers to change the sex of a baby inside the womb. Nicholas contrived a medical diploma from the Imperial Military Medical Academy for Philippe and made him State Councilor and military doctor. Nicholas&#x27;s mother (Maria), sister (Xenia) and sister-in-law (Ella) were alarmed and warned him and Alexandra to stay away from Philippe, but the imperial couple did not heed their advice.

In the end of 1901 Alexandra seemed to have become pregnant again and Philippe swore that she was carrying a boy. By the summer of 1902 it was clear that the Empress was not pregnant. Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich of Russia wrote, &quot;From 8 August we have been waiting every day for confirmation of the Empress&#x27;s pregnancy. Now we have suddenly learned that she is not pregnant, indeed that there never was any pregnancy, and that the symptoms that led to suppose it were in fact only anaemia!&quot;. In reality, Alexandra had had a molar pregnancy. On 19 August 1902 she had suffered a discharge of &quot;a spherical, fleshy mass the size of a walnut&quot;, which Dr Dmitry Ott confirmed was a dead fertilized egg in the fourth week of gestation. To save face, the court physicians published a bulletin on 21 August claiming that Alexandra had &quot;a straightforward miscarriage, without any complications.&quot; Humiliated, Alexandra sent Philippe to France.

In 1903 Alexandra and Nicholas decided to support the canonisation of Seraphim of Sarov. Before he left Russia Philippe told them that Seraphim would grant Alexandra a son. Seraphim had been a monk in the Tambov region who had supposedly performed local miracles and had been dead for seventy years. The Metropolitan of Moscow reluctantly agreed to canonize the saint. On 19 August Alexandra and Nicholas bathed in the Sarov Spring in which Seraphim had once bathed and prayed that the sacred waters would bless them with a son.

In 1904 Alexandra became pregnant. There was high anticipation for a son. As her due date drew near, a newspaper noted that &quot;a few days will decide whether the Czarina is to be the most popular woman in Russia, or regarded by the great bulk of the people as a castaway – under the special wrath of God.&quot; On 12 August 1904 Alexandra gave birth to Alexei Nikolaevich in Peterhof. Alexei&#x27;s birth affirmed Nicholas and Alexandra&#x27;s faith in Philippe. In her diary Nicholas&#x27;s sister Olga wrote, &quot;I am sure it was Seraphim who brought it about.&quot; Nicholas wrote to Militza to &quot;pass on our gratitude and joy … to Philippe.&quot;

===Relationship with her children===
Alexandra had a distant relationship with Olga. She relied on Olga to keep her younger siblings in order. Her letters to Olga include frequent reminders to mind her siblings: &quot;Remember above all to always be a good example to the little ones&quot; and &quot;Try to have a serious word with Tatiana and Maria about how they should conduct themselves towards God.&quot; Olga was frustrated by trying to keep her boisterous siblings in order, and she complained that her mother had no time for her. Olga preferred her father.

Alexandra was closest to her second daughter, Tatiana. Tatiana resembled Alexandra the most in terms of appearance and personality. She was described by her paternal aunt Xenia: &quot;[Tatiana] and her mother are like as two peas in a pod!... so pretty.&quot; She was cautious and reserved, and she was unquestioningly devoted to Alexandra. During the family&#x27;s final months, she helped her mother by pushing her about the house in a wheelchair.

Maria felt insecure about her role in the family, and Alexandra frequently assured Maria that she was as loved as her siblings: &quot;Sweet child you must promise me never again to think that nobody loves you. How did such an extraordinary idea get into your little head? Get it quickly out again.&quot; Maria worried that Alexandra favored Anastasia over her, and Alexandra reassured her that &quot;I have no secrets with Anastasia.&quot;

Anastasia physically resembled Alexandra, but her boisterous, mischievous personality was very different from her mother&#x27;s. She was dubbed the &quot;shvibzik,&quot; Russian for &quot;imp.&quot; During the family&#x27;s last months, Anastasia was the only one who could make the melancholy Alexandra laugh.

Alexandra doted on Alexei because he was her only son and the heir to the Russian Empire. The children&#x27;s tutor Pierre Gilliard wrote, &quot;Alexei was the centre of a united family, the focus of all its hopes and affections. His sisters worshipped him. He was his parents&#x27; pride and joy. When he was well, the palace was transformed. Everyone and everything in it seemed bathed in sunshine.&quot; Alexandra was obsessed with trying to protect him from his disease of hemophilia. According to Gilliard, she &quot;press[ed] the little boy to her with the convulsive movement of a mother who always seems in fear of her child&#x27;s life.&quot; She sat at Alexei&#x27;s bedside for days as he suffered through his attacks. She feared that he would injure himself in tantrums, so she spoiled him and never punished him.

Despite her fears of never bearing a son, Alexandra loved her daughters and called them her &quot;little four-leaved clover&quot;. She wrote that &quot;our girlies are our joy and happiness&quot; and &quot;the apostles of God”.

===Health===
Alexandra&#x27;s health was never robust and her frequent pregnancies, with four daughters in six years and her son three years after, drew from her energy. Her biographers, including Robert K. Massie, Carolly Erickson, Greg King, and Peter Kurth, attribute the semi-invalidism of her later years to nervous exhaustion from obsessive worry over the fragile tsarevich, who suffered from hemophilia. She spent most of her time in bed or reclining on a chaise in her boudoir or on a veranda. This immobility enabled her to avoid the social occasions that she found distasteful. Alexandra regularly took a herbal medicine known as &quot;adonis vernalis&quot; in order to regulate her pulse. She was constantly tired, slept badly, and complained of swollen feet. She ate little, but never lost weight (except for the last year of her life). She may have suffered from Graves disease (hyperthyroidism), a condition resulting in high levels of the thyroid hormone, which can also result in atrial fibrillation, poor heartbeat and lack of energy.

===Hemophilia and Rasputin===
Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich of Russia was heir apparent to the throne of Russia and the only son of Nicholas and Alexandra. Shortly after his birth, the court doctors realized that he had hemophilia. After his umbilical cord was cut, his stomach bled for days and his blood did not clot. Nicholas wrote that Alexei lost &quot;1/8 to 1/9 of the total quantity&quot; of his blood in 48 hours. Hemophilia had entered the royal houses of Europe via the daughters of Queen Victoria, including Alexandra&#x27;s mother, Princess Alice. In the early 20th century hemophilia was often fatal and the average life expectancy of hemophiliacs was 13. Alexandra&#x27;s brother, Friedrich, and maternal uncle Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, had died young of hemophilia. Alexandra&#x27;s sister Princess Irene of Hesse and by Rhine and first cousin Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg were also carriers of the hemophilia gene and had hemophiliac sons.

Alexandra felt immense guilt that she had passed down the disease to her son. Shortly after Alexei&#x27;s diagnosis, she wept and told the nurse, &quot;If only you knew how fervently I&#x27;ve prayed for God to protect my son from our inherited curse.&quot; Nicholas&#x27; sister Xenia called hemophilia &quot;the terrible disease of the English family&quot;, and members of the imperial family blamed Alexandra for &quot;contaminating the Romanovs with the diseases of her own race.&quot;

As the incurable illness threatened the sole son and heir of the emperor, the imperial family decided to keep his condition secret from the Russian people. They wanted to limit social instability because of uncertainty. At first Alexandra turned to Russian doctors to treat Alexei. Their treatments generally failed. Burdened with the threats to her son from any fall or cut, Alexandra turned toward faith for comfort. She studied the Orthodox faith and saints and spent hours daily praying in her private chapel for deliverance.

Grigori Rasputin, a peasant from Siberia, appeared to have a cure for her son by praying for him and became powerful in court as a result. Over time Alexandra grew to believe that Rasputin was the only man who could save her son&#x27;s life. Rasputin was straightforward with Alexandra and told her, &quot;Neither the Emperor nor you can do without me. If I am not there to protect you, you will lose your son... within six months.&quot; Alexandra blinded herself to evidence of Rasputin&#x27;s debauchery and the harm his presence did to imperial prestige. The director of the national police told Alexandra that a drunk Rasputin had exposed himself at a popular Moscow restaurant and bragged that Nicholas gave him sexual access to her, but she blamed the account on malicious gossip. &quot;Saints are always calumniated,&quot; she once wrote. &quot;He is hated because we love him.&quot; Nicholas recognized Rasputin&#x27;s faults but he felt powerless to do anything about the man who seemingly saved his only son&#x27;s life. Pierre Gilliard wrote, &quot;He did not like to send Rasputin away, for if Alexei died, in the eyes of the mother, he would have been the murderer of his own son.&quot;

From the start members of the court exchanged gossip about Rasputin. Although some of St Petersburg&#x27;s top clergy accepted him as a living prophet, others angrily denounced him as a fraud and a heretic. Made-up stories from his life in Siberia were heard in St. Petersburg. For instance he was said to conduct weddings for villagers in exchange for sleeping on the first night with the bride. He lived in St Petersburg with his two daughters and two housekeepers and was often visited by persons seeking his blessing, a healing or a favour from the tsarina. Women, enchanted by the healer, also came to Rasputin for advice and individual blessings and received a private audience in his apartment, jokingly called the &quot;Holy of Holies&quot;. Rasputin liked to preach a unique theology that one must become familiar with sin before having a chance to overcome it. No one believed that Rasputin could heal Alexei, so court officials were confused as to why Alexandra was so dependent on him.

In 1912 Alexei suffered a life-threatening haemorrhage in the thigh while the family was at Spała in Poland. Alexandra sat for days at his bedside and she rarely ate or slept. She cried helplessly when Alexei begged for death and asked her to bury him in a forest instead of the mausoleum with his Romanov ancestors. The doctors expected Alexei to die and a priest performed his last rites. The court officials prepared an official telegram to announce the death of the tsarevich. In desperation Alexandra sent a telegram to Rasputin, who replied: &quot;God has seen your tears and heard your prayers. Do not grieve. The Little One will not die. Do not allow the doctors to bother him too much.&quot; To the shock of his doctors Alexei recovered his health and survived. From 1912 Alexandra came to rely increasingly on Rasputin and to believe in his ability to ease Alexei&#x27;s suffering. It looked as if this reliance enhanced Rasputin&#x27;s political power, but it is hard to detach gossips from the truth. His role in the court seriously undermined Romanov rule during the First World War.

Rasputin was assassinated to end his perceived interference in political matters on 30 December 1916. Among the conspirators were the nobleman Prince Felix Yusupov, who was married to Nicholas II&#x27;s niece, Princess Irina of Russia, and Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich, who had once been close to Nicholas and Alexandra&#x27;s family.

===World War I===

The outbreak of World War I was a pivotal moment for Russia and Alexandra. The war pitted the Russian Empire of the Romanov dynasty against the German Empire of the Hohenzollern dynasty. When Alexandra learned of the Russian mobilization, she stormed into her husband&#x27;s study and said: &quot;War! And I knew nothing of it! This is the end of everything.&quot;

Alexandra&#x27;s ties to Germany made her more unpopular among some societies in Russia. Her brother Ernest Louis ruled the Grand Duchy of Hesse and by Rhine, so he fought with the Germans. The German Emperor, Wilhelm II, was Alexandra&#x27;s first cousin. Alexandra&#x27;s sister, Irene, was married to Wilhelm&#x27;s brother, Henry. Ironically, Alexandra was an ardent Russian patriot and disliked the German Emperor. She privately wrote that Wilhelm II &quot;is really nothing but a clown. He has no real worth. His only virtues are his strict morals and his conjugal fidelity.&quot;

High society in St Petersburg, renamed the Russified Petrograd, accused her of collaboration with the Germans. In Petrograd there was a rumor that Alexandra was hiding her brother Ernest in Russia. In 1916 Alexandra&#x27;s lady-in-waiting wrote that she was asked &quot;in all seriousness whether the Grand Duke of Hesse was not hidden in the cellars of the palace.&quot; Alexandra worked as a nurse to wounded soldiers but her efforts went unappreciated. There were also rumors that Alexandra and Rasputin were carrying on nightly conversations with Wilhelm II in Berlin to negotiate a dishonorable peace.

When Nicholas travelled to the front line in 1915 to take personal command of the army he left Alexandra in charge as regent in the capital. Her brother-in-law, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich, recorded, &quot;When the Emperor went to war of course his wife governed instead of him.&quot;

It looked as if Alexandra appointed and dismissed ministers based on Rasputin&#x27;s self-serving advice but those close to the imperial family circle denied it. In only sixteen months she appointed four prime ministers, five ministers of the interior and three ministers of war. &quot;After the middle of 1915,&quot; wrote Florinsky, &quot;the fairly honorable and efficient group who formed the top of the bureaucratic pyramid degenerated into a rapidly changing succession of the appointees of Rasputin.&quot; Alexei Polivanov was an excellent official, credited with revitalizing the Imperial Russian Army, but Alexandra declared, &quot;I don&#x27;t like the choice of Minister of War Polivanov. Is he not our Friend&#x27;s [Rasputin&#x27;s] enemy?&quot; The general Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich disliked Rasputin because Rasputin saw and told Alexandra that the grand duke was deliberately currying favor in the army and overshadowing Nicholas so that he could claim the throne. On 16 June Alexandra wrote to the tsar, &quot;I have absolutely no faith in N... [he has] gone against a Man of God [Rasputin], his work can&#x27;t be blessed or his advice good... Russia will not be blessed if her sovereign lets a Man of God sent to help him be persecuted, I am sure.&quot; She insisted to Nicholas that &quot;[Rasputin] has your interest and Russia&#x27;s at heart. It is not for nothing God sent him to us, only we must pay more attention to what He says. His words are not lightly spoken and the importance of having not only his prayers but his advice is great.&quot;

Ever a believer in autocracy, Alexandra persuaded Nicholas that he must never relinquish his absolute power as Emperor. She wrote to him: &quot;You are master and sovereign of Russia. Almighty God set you in place, and they should all bow down before your wisdom and steadfastness.&quot; She advised him to &quot;Be Peter the Great, Ivan the Terrible, Emperor Paul-- crush them all.&quot; She criticized the Duma and declared &quot;they want to discuss things not concerning them and bring more discontent—they must be kept away... We are not ready for constitutional government.&quot;

During the war there was great concern within the imperial house about the influence Empress Alexandra had upon state affairs through the Tsar and the influence Rasputin was believed to have upon her, since it was considered to provoke the public and endanger the safety of the imperial throne and the survival of the monarchy. On behalf of the imperial relatives of the Tsar, Grand Duchesses Elizabeth Feodorovna and Victoria Feodorovna had been selected to mediate and ask Empress Alexandra to banish Rasputin from court to protect her and the throne&#x27;s reputation, the former twice, but without success. In parallel, several of the grand dukes had tried to intervene with the Tsar but with no more success.
During this conflict of 1916–1917 Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna reportedly planned a coup d&#x27;état to depose the Tsar with the help of four regiments of the Russian Imperial Guard, which were to invade the Alexander Palace, force the tsar to abdicate and replace him with his underage son under the regency of her son Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich.

There are documents that support the fact that, in this critical situation, the Empress Dowager Maria Feodorovna was involved in a planned coup d&#x27;état to depose her son from the throne in order to save the monarchy. The plan was reportedly for Maria to make a final ultimatum to the Tsar to banish Rasputin unless he wished her to leave the capital, which would be the signal to unleash the coup. Exactly how she planned to replace her son is unconfirmed but two versions are available: first, that Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich would take power in her name and that she herself would thereafter become ruling empress; the other version claims that she and Grand Duke Paul would replace the Tsar with his son, the heir to the throne, Maria&#x27;s grandson Alexei, whereupon Maria and Paul would share power as regents during his minority. Reportedly, Empress Alexandra was informed about the planned coup and when Maria Feodorovna made the ultimatum to the Tsar the empress persuaded him to order his mother to leave the capital. Consequently the dowager empress left Petrograd to live in the Mariinskyi Palace in Kyiv the same year. She never again returned to the capital of Russia.

==Revolution (1917)==
World War I put what proved to be an unbearable burden on Imperial Russia&#x27;s government and economy, both of which were dangerously weak. Mass shortages and hunger became the daily situation for tens of millions of Russians owing to the disruptions of the war economy. Fifteen million men were diverted from agricultural production to fight in the war and the transport infrastructure (primarily railroads) was diverted towards war use, exacerbating food shortages in the cities since available agricultural products could not be brought to urban areas. Inflation was rampant. This, combined with the food shortages and the poor performance by the Russian military in the war, generated a great deal of anger and unrest among the people in Petrograd and other cities.

The decision of the Tsar to take personal command of the military was disastrous, since he was blamed personally for all losses. His relocation to the front, leaving the Empress in charge of the government, helped undermine the Romanov dynasty. The poor performance of the military led to rumours, believed by the people, that the German-born Empress was part of a conspiracy to help Germany win the war. Moreover, within several months of taking personal command of the army, the Tsar replaced several capable ministers with less able men at the Empress’s and Rasputin&#x27;s behest; most notable among these replacements was replacing N. B. Shcherbatov with Alexei Khvostov as minister of the interior. The severe winter of 1916–17 essentially doomed Imperial Russia. Food shortages worsened and famine gripped the cities. The mismanagement and failures of the war turned the soldiers against the Tsar. By 1917 the Tsar had realized that Russia could not fight the war much longer, and as railroads carried troops to the front there was little capacity left to bring food to the cities.

By March 1917 conditions had become even worse. Steelworkers went on strike on 7 March and the following day crowds hungry for bread began rioting on the streets of Petrograd to protest against food shortages and the war. After two days of rioting the Tsar ordered the army to restore order and on 11 March they fired on the crowd. That very same day the Duma, the elected legislature, urged the Tsar to take action to ameliorate the concerns of the people. The Tsar responded by dissolving the Duma.

On 12 March soldiers sent to suppress the rioting crowds mutinied and joined the rebellion, thus providing the spark to ignite the February Revolution. (Like the later October Revolution of November 1917, the Russian Revolutions of 1917 are named according to the Old-Style calendar.) Soldiers and workers set up the ‘Petrograd Soviet&quot; of 2,500 elected deputies whilst the Duma declared a Provisional Government on 13 March. Alexander Kerensky was a key player in the new regime. The Duma informed the Tsar that day that he must abdicate.

In an effort to put an end to the uprising in the capital, Nicholas tried to get to Petrograd by train from army headquarters at Mogilev. The route was blocked so he tried another way. His train was stopped at Pskov where, after receiving advice from his generals, he first abdicated the throne for himself and later, on seeking medical advice, for himself and his son, the Tsarevich Alexei.

Alexandra was now in a perilous position as the wife of the deposed Tsar, hated by the Russian people. Attempts were made by the mutinous Tsarskoye Selo garrison to storm the Alexander Palace but it was successfully defended by the palace guards. The palace guards and other troops gradually left for the capital after being informed about the abdication and Alexandra asked the Duma to put in place security measures for her and her household in view of the riots and violence in the nearby capital. On 18 March Mikhail Rodzianko sent the newly appointed Minister of War, Alexander Guchkov, and General Lavr Kornilov to Alexandra to inspect the security of the palace, which resulted in an officer being appointed to maintain the security of the palace as well as to act as a channel of communication between the palace and the Duma. After this Alexandra noticed that the guards defending the palace gradually began to wear handkerchiefs around their wrists, signalling that they supported the Duma, which also meant that she and her children, while being defended from immediate harm, were nevertheless under de facto house arrest from that moment on. Alexandra and her children and household were not molested in any way and the household was left to continue its everyday life as before, with the exception of occasional power cuts. On 21 March Kornilov informed Alexandra that she was formally under house arrest and the members of the household were informed that they were free to leave if they wished but if they chose to stay they would have to obey the same rules as pertained to the house arrest of Alexandra.

The following day, on 22 March, Nicholas was finally allowed to return to the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoe Selo, where he was placed under arrest with his family. Alexandra told him that &quot;the husband and father was of more value in her eyes than the Emperor whose throne she had shared.&quot;

==Imprisonment (1917–1918)==
The Provisional Government formed after the revolution kept Nicholas, Alexandra and their children confined under house arrest in their home, the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo. They were visited by Alexander Kerensky from the government, who interviewed Alexandra regarding her involvement in state affairs and Rasputin&#x27;s involvement in them through his influence over her. She answered that as she and her spouse kept no secrets from each other they often discussed politics and she naturally gave him advice to support him; as for Rasputin, he had been a true holy man of God and his advice had been only in the interest of the good of Russia and the imperial family. After the interview Kerensky told the Tsar that he believed that Alexandra had told him the truth and was not lying.

The Provisional Government did not wish to keep the family in Russia, particularly as both the family and the government were under threat from the Bolsheviks; they trusted that the former Tsar and his family would be received in Great Britain and ensured that inquiries were being made. Despite the fact he was a first cousin of both Nicholas and Alexandra, George V refused to allow them and their family permission to evacuate to the United Kingdom, since he was alarmed by their unpopularity in his country and the potential repercussions to his own throne. After this it was suggested they be moved to France. However, although the French government was never asked, British diplomats in France reported that the family was not likely to be welcome there, since anti-German sentiments were strong in France during the war and Alexandra was widely unpopular because she was believed to be a sympathizer of Germany. The Provisional Government was reportedly very disappointed that no foreign state seemed to be willing to receive the family and was forced to relocate them within Russia, since the security situation was becoming more and more difficult.

In August 1917 the family were moved to Tobolsk in Siberia, a step by the Kerensky government designed to remove them from the capital and possible harm. Nicholas and Alexandra had themselves suggested that they be moved to the Livadia Palace in the Crimea, but Kerensky deemed it to be too dangerous: to get to the Crimea they would have to travel through Central Russia, an area at that time affected by widespread revolutionary violence and riots where the upper classes and aristocracy were attacked by the public and their mansions burned. Tobolsk in Siberia was, in contrast to Central and Southern Russia, a calm and peaceful place with greater security and more sympathy for the former Tsar. There were indications that the Provisional Government were actually attempting to transport them out of Russia by the Trans-Siberian Railway, thus fulfilling the government&#x27;s wish to have them expelled, but now via a different route, after the first attempt to exile them to Europe had failed. However this plan was not revealed to the family, and if it had indeed been the intent of the government it had to be cancelled because of a strong Bolshevik presence in Yekaterinburg and other cities along the Trans-Siberian Railway east of Tobolsk, and the family therefore continued to their official destination.

From Tobolsk Alexandra managed to send a letter to her sister-in-law, Xenia Alexandrovna, in Crimea:

Alexandra and her family remained in Tobolsk until after the Bolshevik Revolution in November 1917. The fall of the Provisional Government and the Bolshevik&#x27;s accession to power greatly worsened their position.

In 1918 they were moved to Bolshevik-controlled Yekaterinburg. Nicholas, Alexandra and their daughter Maria arrived at the Ipatiev House on 30 April 1918. On entering their new prison they were ordered to open all their luggage. Alexandra immediately objected. Nicholas tried to come to her defence saying, &quot;So far we have had polite treatment and men who were gentlemen but now -&quot; The former Tsar was quickly cut off. The guards informed him he was no longer at Tsarskoye Selo and that refusal to comply with their request would result in his removal from the rest of his family; a second offence would be rewarded with hard labour. Fearing for her husband&#x27;s safety, Alexandra quickly gave in and allowed the search. On the window frame of what was to be her last bedroom in the Ipatiev House, Alexandra scrawled a swastika, her favourite good-luck symbol, and pencilled the date 17/30 April 1918. In May the rest of the family arrived in Yekaterinburg. They had not been able to travel earlier owing to the illness of Alexei. Alexandra was pleased to be reunited with her family once more.

Seventy-five men did guard duty at the Ipatiev House. Many of them were factory workers from the local Zlokazovsky Factory and the Verkh-Isetsk Factory. The commandant of the Ipatiev House, Alexander Avadeyev, was described as &quot;a real Bolshevik&quot;. The majority of witnesses recall him as coarse, brutish and a heavy drinker. If a request for a favour on behalf of the family reached Avadeyev, he always gave the same response, &quot;Let them go to hell!&quot; The guards in the house often heard him refer to the deposed Tsar as &quot;Nicholas the Blood-Drinker&quot; and to Alexandra as &quot;The German Bitch&quot;.

For the Romanovs life at the Ipatiev House was a nightmare of uncertainty and fear. The imperial family never knew if they would still be in the Ipatiev House from one day to the next or if they might be separated or killed. The privileges allowed to them were few. For an hour each afternoon they could exercise in the rear garden under the watchful eye of the guards. Alexei could still not walk and his sailor Nagorny had to carry him. Alexandra rarely joined her family in these daily activities. Instead she spent most of her time sitting in a wheelchair, reading the Bible or the works of St Seraphim. At night the Romanovs played cards or read; they received little mail from the outside world and the only newspapers they were allowed were outdated editions.

Dmitri Volkogonov and other Soviet historians believe that indirect evidence indicates that Vladimir Lenin personally ordered the execution of the imperial family, although official Soviet accounts place the responsibility for the decision with the Ural Regional Soviet. Leon Trotsky, in his diary, makes it quite clear that the execution took place on the authority of Lenin. Trotsky wrote:

On 4 July 1918 Yakov Yurovsky, the chief of the Yekaterinburg Cheka, was appointed commandant of the Ipatiev House. Yurovsky was a loyal Bolshevik, a man Moscow could rely on to carry out its orders regarding the imperial family. Yurovsky quickly tightened security. From the imperial family he collected all of their jewellery and valuables. These he placed in a box which he sealed and left with the prisoners. Alexandra kept only two bracelets, which her uncle Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany had given her as a child and which she could not take off. He did not know that the former tsarina and her daughters wore concealed on their person diamonds, emeralds, rubies and ropes of pearls. These would be discovered only after the executions. Yurovsky had been given the order for the execution on 13 July.

On Sunday 14 July 1918 two priests came to the Ipatiev House to celebrate the Divine Liturgy. One of them, Father Storozhev, later recalled:

==Execution==
Tuesday 16 July 1918 passed normally for the former imperial family. At four o&#x27;clock in the afternoon Nicholas and his daughters took their usual walk in the small garden. Early in the evening Yurovsky sent away the fifteen-year-old kitchen boy, Leonid Sednev, saying that his uncle wished to see him. At 7 p.m., Yurovsky summoned all the Cheka men into his room and ordered them to collect all the revolvers from the outside guards. With twelve heavy military revolvers lying before him on the table he said, &quot;Tonight, we shoot the entire family, everybody.&quot; Upstairs Nicholas and Alexandra passed the evening playing bezique; at ten thirty they went to bed.

The former tsar, tsarina and all of their family, including the gravely ill Alexei, along with several family servants, were executed by firing squad and bayonets in the basement of the Ipatiev House, where they had been imprisoned, early in the morning of 17 July 1918, by a detachment of Bolsheviks led by Yakov Yurovsky. In the basement room of the Ipatiev House Alexandra complained that there were no chairs for them to sit on, whereupon Nicholas asked for and received three chairs from the guards. Minutes later, at about 2:15 a.m., a squad of soldiers, each armed with a revolver, entered the room. Their leader Yurovsky ordered the entire party to stand; Alexandra complied &quot;with a flash of anger&quot; and Yurovsky then casually pronounced, &quot;Your relatives have tried to save you. They have failed and we must now shoot you.&quot; Nicholas rose from his chair and had time to utter only &quot;What...?&quot; before he was shot several times, not (as is usually said) in the head but in the chest; his skull bears no bullet wounds but his ribs were shattered by at least three fatal bullet wounds. Standing about six feet from the gunmen and facing them, Alexandra watched the execution of her husband and two manservants before military commissar Peter Ermakov took aim at her. She instinctively turned away from him and began to make the sign of the cross, but before she could finish the gesture Ermakov killed her with a single gunshot which, as she had partly turned away, entered her head just above the left ear and exited at the same spot above her right ear. After all the victims had been shot, Ermakov in a drunken haze stabbed Alexandra&#x27;s body and that of her husband, shattering both their rib cages and chipping some of Alexandra&#x27;s vertebrae.

===Identification of remains===

After the execution of the Romanov family in the Ipatiev House, Alexandra&#x27;s body, along with those of Nicholas, their children and some faithful retainers who died with them, was stripped and the clothing burnt according to the Yurovsky Note, a secret report by Yurovsky, which came to light in the late 1970s but did not become public knowledge until the 1990s. Initially the bodies were thrown down a disused mine-shaft at Ganina Yama, 12 miles (19 km) north of Yekaterinburg. A short time later the bodies were retrieved. Their faces were smashed and the bodies, dismembered and disfigured with sulphuric acid, were hurriedly buried under railway sleepers with the exception of two of the children, whose bodies were not discovered until 2007. The Yurovsky Note helped the authorities to locate the bodies. The missing bodies were those of a daughter—Maria or Anastasia—and Alexei. In the early 1990s, following the fall of the Soviet Union, the bodies of the majority of the Romanovs were located along with their loyal servants, exhumed and formally identified. Preliminary results of genetic analysis carried out on the remains of a boy and a young woman believed to belong to Nicholas II&#x27;s son and heir Alexei and daughter Anastasia or Maria were revealed on 22 January 2008. The Ekaterinburg region&#x27;s chief forensic expert said, &quot;Tests conducted in Yekaterinburg and Moscow allowed DNA to be extracted from the bones, which proved positive,&quot; Nikolai Nevolin said. &quot;Once the genetic analysis has been completed in Russia, its results will be compared with test results from foreign experts.&quot; Nevolin said the final results would be published in April or May 2008. Certainty about the remains definitively put an end to the claim that Anna Anderson could be connected with the Romanovs, since all remaining bodies would be accounted for.

DNA analysis represented a key means of identifying the bodies. A blood sample from Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (a grandson of Alexandra&#x27;s oldest sister, Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine), was used to identify Alexandra and her daughters through their mitochondrial DNA. They belonged to Haplogroup H (mtDNA). Nicholas was identified using DNA obtained from, among others, his late brother Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia. Grand Duke George had died of tuberculosis in the late 1890s and was buried in the Peter and Paul Fortress in St Petersburg.

===Burial===
Alexandra, Nicholas and three daughters plus the servants who were killed with them were reinterred in the St Catherine Chapel of the Peter and Paul Cathedral at the Peter and Paul Fortress in Saint Petersburg in 1998, with much ceremony, on the eightieth anniversary of the execution.

==Personality and appearance==

Alexandra was revered by many for her beauty. Her maternal grandmother, Queen Victoria, praised her as &quot;a most lovely child.&quot; Her friend Anna Vyrubova described her as &quot;tall...and delicately, beautifully shaped, with exquisitely white neck and shoulders. Her abundant hair, red gold, was so long that she could easily sit upon it when it was unbound. Her complexion was clear and as rosy as a little child&#x27;s. The Empress had large eyes, deep gray and very lustrous.&quot; A lady-in-waiting, Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden, said that she was &quot;a tall, slim girl&quot; with &quot;beautiful luminous eyes,&quot; &quot;regular features,&quot; a &quot;very good complexion,&quot; and &quot;beautiful golden hair.&quot; An imperial courtier commented favourably about &quot;her wonderful hair which lay like a heavy crown on her head and large dark-blue eyes beneath long lashes.&quot; In 1905, her daughters&#x27; tutor Pierre Gilliard wrote that &quot;the Tsarina was still a beautiful woman at that time. She was tall and slender and carried herself superbly. But all this ceased the moment one looked into her eyes—those speaking, grey-blue eyes which mirrored the emotions of a sensitive soul.&quot;

Alexandra was shy. When her grandmother Queen Victoria insisted that she play the piano for others, she felt that her &quot;clammy hands... [were] literally glued to the keys&quot; and later described the experience as &quot;one of the worst ordeals&quot; of her life. When she was empress, a page in the imperial household described her as &quot;so obviously nervous of conversation&quot; and claimed that &quot;at moments when she needed to show some social graces or a charming smile, her face would become suffused with little red spots and she would look intensely serious.&quot; Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich of Russia noted that she &quot;is terribly shy... It&#x27;s noticeable that she does not have her mother-in-law&#x27;s charm, and still does not, therefore, inspire general adulation.&quot; Nadine Wonar-Larsky, her lady-in-waiting, noted that she was &quot;extremely shy even at such an informal affair as receiving&quot; Wonlar-Larsky and her mother to tea. An imperial courtier noted that &quot;when she was conversing or grew tired, her face became covered in red blotches [and] her hands were red and fleshy.&quot; She herself admitted that during social functions, she &quot;long[ed] to disappear into the ground.&quot; She told her friend Marie Bariatinsky that &quot;I am not made to shine before an assembly—I have not got the easy nor the witty talk one needs for that.&quot; This was often mistaken as haughtiness. Her brother Ernest Louis reflected that &quot;she would unsmilingly tilt her head to one side if something displeased her, with the result that people often thought that she was unhappy, or bored, or simply capricious.&quot; Her daughters&#x27; tutor Pierre Gilliard reflected that &quot;the reserve which so many people had taken as an affront and had made her so many enemies was rather the effect of a natural timidity, as it were—a mask covering her sensitiveness.&quot;

Even from a young age, Alexandra was serious and melancholic. Her first cousin and childhood friend Princess Marie Louise said that she had &quot;a curious atmosphere of fatality.&quot; Princess Marie Louise allegedly asked her, &quot;Alix, you always play at being sorrowful; one day the Almighty will send you some real crushing sorrows, and then what are you going to do?&quot; Sir George William Buchanan, who was a diplomat for Alexandra&#x27;s grandmother Queen Victoria, reflected that Alexandra had a &quot;sad and pathetic expression.&quot;

Alexandra was devoutly religious. Although she loved Nicholas, she initially refused his proposal because she refused to convert from Lutheranism and join the Russian Orthodox Church, as was expected of all wives of Russian emperors. She told Nicholas that even though &quot;it grieves me terribly and makes me very unhappy&quot; not to marry him, leaving the Lutheran church would be &quot;a wrongful thing.&quot; Generous to her friends, she would try to help others: her lady-in-waiting Sophie Buxhoeveden wrote that she was &quot;ready to do literally anything for her friends&quot; and that &quot;she would take up things and people with violent enthusiasm.&quot; Alexandra admitted that &quot;I am of the preacher type. I want to help others in life, to help them to fight their battles and bear their crosses.&quot;. Such feelings give a clue to her friendship with the plain, naïve Anna Vyrubova whom she consoled after a brief and disastrous marriage.

Princess Alice had encouraged in her children the importance of and potential learning from literature and Alexandra grew up well-read in English and German. In her first years as empress, she translated Russian writings and studied Russian music to improve her command of the language. She read Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s novels and discussed them with her husband.

Alexandra enjoyed music. When she was young, she played the banjo and sang duets for hours with Queen Victoria&#x27;s lady-in-waiting Minnie Cochrane. She enjoyed playing the piano with her daughter Olga, who inherited her musical talent.

== Sainthood ==
In 1981 Alexandra and her immediate family were recognised as martyrs by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia. In 2000 Alexandra was canonized as a saint and passion bearer by the Russian Orthodox Church, together with her husband, their children and others including her sister Grand Duchess Elisabeth Feodorovna and the Grand Duchess&#x27;s fellow nun Varvara.

<text>Laputa is a flying island described in the 1726 book &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; by Jonathan Swift. It is about 4½ miles (7¼km) in diameter, with an adamantine base, which its inhabitants can manoeuvre in any direction using magnetic levitation. The island is the home of the king of Balnibarbi and his court, and is used by the king to enforce his rule over the lands below.

==Location==
Laputa was located above the realm of Balnibarbi, which was ruled by its king from the flying island. Gulliver states the island flew by the &quot;magnetic virtue&quot; of certain minerals in the grounds of Balnibarbi which did not extend to more than above, and beyond the extent of the kingdom, showing the limit of its range. The position of the island, and the realm below, is some five days&#x27; journey south-south-east of Gulliver&#x27;s last known position, 46° N, 183° E (i.e. east of Japan, south of the Aleutian Islands) down a chain of small rocky islands.

==Legacy==

* On Mars&#x27;s largest moon, Phobos, there is a feature named regio, &quot;Laputa Regio&quot;, which is named after Swift&#x27;s Laputa because of his &#x27;prediction&#x27; of the two then undiscovered Martian moons, which his Laputan astronomers had discovered.

* The 1986 Japanese animated fantasy film &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot;, directed by Hayao Miyazaki, derives its name and basic premise from Swift&#x27;s novel.

* In the 1964 comedy film &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, the primary target for the B-52 bomber crew is given as &quot;the ICBM complex at Laputa&quot;.

<text>The Abbadid dynasty or Abbadids () was an Arab dynasty from the tribe of Banu Lakhm of al-Hirah, which ruled the Taifa of Seville in al-Andalus following the fall of the Caliphate of Cordoba in 1031. After the collapse, they were the most powerful Taifa and before long absorbed most of the others. Abbadid rule lasted from about 1023 until 1091, but during the short period of its existence it exhibited singular energy and typified its time.

==Overview==
During their reign, the Abbadids also made significant contributions to the development of science, military technology and medicine. Their patronage of scholars and researchers helped to create a culture of learning that encouraged scientific inquiry and experimentation. The Abbadids&#x27; interest in science is evident in the many scientific works that were written during their reign, including the famous Book of Optics by the polymath Ibn al-Haytham.

In addition to their patronage of the arts, sciences, and literature, the Abbadids also made significant contributions to the development of Islamic law and jurisprudence. They were known for their fair and just rule, and they encouraged the use of Islamic law to settle disputes and conflicts. This helped to create a stable and peaceful society in Andalusia, which was admired by people throughout the Muslim world.

Despite their many achievements, the Abbadids were eventually overthrown by the Almoravids, who were more conservative and orthodox in their interpretation of Islam. The Almoravids saw the Abbadids&#x27; tolerance of other religions and cultures as a threat to the purity of Islam, and they were determined to impose their own strict interpretation of the faith on Andalusia. This led to a period of religious and cultural repression that stifled the creative and intellectual energy of the region.

Despite their eventual downfall, the Abbadids left a lasting legacy in Andalusia. They were known for their love of art and architecture, their patronage of literature and science, and their tolerance of other religions and cultures. Their reign helped to create a rich and diverse society that was admired throughout the Muslim world, and their contributions to Islamic law and jurisprudence helped to create a stable and just society in Andalusia. The Abbadids&#x27; legacy continues to be celebrated today as an important period in the history of the Iberian Peninsula.

==History==
===Abu al-Qasim Muhammad ibn Abbad (ruled 1023–1042)===

Abu al-Qasim Muhammad ibn Abbad (), the &quot;qadi&quot; of Seville, founded the house in 1023.

The Abbadids had not previously played a major role in history though they were of noble pedigree from tribe Lakhm in Egypt and were among the first Arab Muslim families to settle in al-Andalus after the Umayyad conquest of Hispania. Abu al-Qasim&#x27;s father, Isma&#x27;il ibn Abbad (died 1023) was named as &quot;qadi&quot; of Sevilla by the regent Almanzor, and established his family&#x27;s leading role in the city: the contemporary historian Ibn Hayyan reports that his son owned no less than third of Seville&#x27;s territory, making him by far the richest man in the city.

Abu al-Qasim gained the confidence of the townsmen by playing a major role in the successful resistance to the Berber soldiers of fortune who had grasped at the fragments of the Caliphate of Cordoba. After the Berbers were forced out, he was, by near unanimous voice of the people and prompting of the merchant and nobles, given the reins of power. Initially, he refused the position, worried of the fatal repercussions that could follow failure or the changing of the voice of the people. At first, he professed to rule only with the advice of a council formed of the nobles.

Abu al-Qasim&#x27;s first order of business was to rebuild the military of Seville, which had, in recent times, disappeared. This, he accomplished by first creating recruiting posts in all settlements controlled by Seville. The promise of substantial pay along with promises of unrestricted looting brought many able men to him. Second, he opened the ranks to all races and social class, as Berbers, Arabs, Christians, and foreigners were all accepted along with slaves from Nubia and Sudan. Before the military could become a formidable force, a Berber army from Málaga was at the gates demanding entrance and fealty, in the form of sons of the richest and most powerful nobles and merchants as hostages. Abu al-Qasim, to show his people his trust in the situation, offered his own son as solitary collateral. This show of bravery, convinced his population to follow him with near zeal, and at this time dismissed the council and began his solitary rule.

From this point on, he was able to make small inroads into the small principalities surrounding him. This began with an alliance forged with the governor of Carmona. His first conquest was Beja, followed by the plunder and subsequent control of the coastal regions from Cadiz west. The Taifa of Badajoz was next as he defeated and captured the son of the emir, and at this early time nearly defeated the Taifa of Córdoba, beaten back at the end by an alliance Cordoba made with the Berbers.

The Berbers continued to be a thorn in the side of Abu al-Qasim, as they now recognized Yahya as their supreme leader, something that had not been accomplished before. At this time, it was apparent to Abu al-Qasim that a coalition was needed to defeat the growing Berber threat; however it was also apparent that he would not be accepted as the head of this coalition of caliphates. Abu al-Qasim was able to procure an imposter who resembled the caliph Hisham II. This man, who was a mat-maker by trade, had previously been involved in an unsuccessful attempt at trickery. This time the deception was successful and the coalition formed starting with Cordoba, then followed by Dénia, Balearic Islands, Tortosa, and Valencia. Angered by the growing forces against him, Yahya was lured into an ambush and along with the larger portion of his command killed. When Abu al-Qasim died in 1042 he had created a state which, though weak in itself, appeared strong as compared to its neighbours. He had made his family the recognized leaders of the Andalusian Muslims against the neo-Berber element arrayed under the king of Granada.

===Abbad II al-Mu&#x27;tadid (ruled 1042–1069)===

Abbad II al-Mu&#x27;tadid (1042–1069), the son and successor of Abu al-Qasim, became one of the most remarkable figures in Iberian Muslim history. He had a striking resemblance to the Italian princes of the later Middle Ages and the early Renaissance, of the stamp of Filippo Maria Visconti.

Abbad wrote poetry and loved literature; he also appears as a poisoner, a drinker of wine, a sceptic, and a man treacherous to the utmost degree. Though he waged war all through his reign, he himself very rarely appeared in the field, but directed the generals, whom he never trusted, from his &quot;lair&quot; in the fortified palace, the Alcázar of Seville. He killed with his own hand one of his sons who had rebelled against him. In 1053, he tricked a number of his enemies, the Berber chiefs of southern al-Andalus, into visiting him, and got rid of them by smothering them in the hot room of a bath. He then seized their kingdoms of Arcos, Moron, and Ronda. He also forcibly annexed the kingdoms of Mertola, Niebla, Huelva and Saltes, Santa Maria do Algarve, and Silves.

He habitually preserved the skulls of the enemies he had killed—those of the meaner men to be used as flower-pots, while those of the princes were kept in special chests. He devoted his reign mainly to extending his power at the expense of his smaller neighbours, and in conflicts with his chief rival the king of Granada. These incessant wars weakened the Muslims, to the great advantage of the rising power of the Christian kings of León and Castile, but they gave the kingdom of Seville a certain superiority over the other little states. After 1063 he was assailed by Fernando El Magno of Castile and León, who marched to the gates of Seville, and forced him to pay tribute. This fealty was so complete, for the remaining two years of Fernando&#x27;s reign, that Abbad even surrendered the remains of St. Isidore.

===Muhammad al-Mu&#x27;tamid (ruled 1069–1095)===


The son of Abbad II, Muhammad al-Mu&#x27;tamid (1069–1095) — who reigned under the title &quot;al-Mu&#x27;tamid&quot; — was the third and last of the Abbadids. No less remarkable than his father, and more amiable, he also wrote poetry and favoured poets. Al-Mu&#x27;tamid went, however, considerably further in patronage of literature than his father, for he chose as his favourite and prime minister the poet Ibn Ammar. In the end the vanity and folly of Ibn Ammar drove his master to kill him.

Al-Mu&#x27;tamid was even more influenced by his favourite wife, al-Rumaikiyya, than by his vizier. He had met her paddling in the Guadalquivir, purchased her from her master, and made her his wife. The caprices of Romaica, and the lavish extravagance of Abbad III in his efforts to please her, form the subject of many stories; a brief tale of the queen appears in the book &quot;&#x27;Libro de los ejemplos del Conde Lucanor y de Patronio&quot; (Book of the examples of Count Lucanor and Patronio), as the tale XXX, &quot;De lo que aconteció al rey Abenabed de Sevilla con su mujer, Ramaiquía&quot; (Of What Happened to King Abenabed of Seville with his Wife, Ramaiquía). On the other hand, the stories about Ibn Ammar and Rumaiqiyya that appear in much later western works probably describe imaginary events.

In 1071, al-Mu&#x27;tamid took control of Cordoba. This was a weak period of control as he had to re-assert control in 1078 and then lost it permanently in 1081. During this period his vizier Ibn Ammar captured Murcia. This period marked the beginning of the end for the Abbadid dynasty, as the following years saw them growing weaker and weaker due to a number of events: first came the start of hostilities with Alfonso VI, followed by the Christians succeeding in Aragon, Valencia, and Toledo; finally, domestic Muslims created issues at home. When Alfonso VI, from Castile, took Toledo in 1085, Al-Mu&#x27;tamid called in Yusuf ibn Tashfin, the Berber Almoravid ruler. He had foreseen the probability that the Almoravids might overthrow him; nevertheless, he chose to ally with them. When his son, Rashid, advised him not to call on Yusuf ibn Tashfin, Al-Mu&#x27;tamid rebuffed him and famously said,

With the assistance of the Almoravids, they were able to defeat Alfonso in 1086. During the six years which preceded his deposition in 1091, Abbasid behaved with valour on the field, but was politically inept and cruel. At the end what he had foreseen happened to him: in 1095 his kingdom was overthrown by Yusuf ibn Tashfin and Almoravid sympathizers within his city, following which he was deposed. He was exiled to Morocco

Al-Mu&#x27;tamid was the father-in-law, through his son, Fath al-Mamun (d. 1091), of Zaida, mistress, and possibly wife, of Alfonso VI of Castile. She is said by Iberian Muslim sources to have been the daughter-in-law of Al Mutamid, the Muslim King of Seville, wife of his son Abu al Fatah al Ma&#x27;Mun, Emir of Cordoba, (d. 1091). Later Iberian Christian chroniclers call her Al Mutamid&#x27;s daughter, but the Islamic chroniclers are considered more reliable. With the fall of Seville to the Almoravids, she fled to the protection of Alfonso VI of Castile, becoming his mistress, converting to Christianity and taking the baptismal name of Isabel.

<text>The Almohad Caliphate (; or or from ) or Almohad Empire was a North African Berber Muslim empire founded in the 12th century. At its height, it controlled much of the Iberian Peninsula (Al-Andalus) and North Africa (the Maghreb).

The Almohad movement was founded by Ibn Tumart among the Berber Masmuda tribes, but the Almohad caliphate and its ruling dynasty, known as the Mu&#x27;minid dynasty, were founded after his death by Abd al-Mu&#x27;min. Around 1121, Ibn Tumart was recognized by his followers as the Mahdi, and shortly afterwards he established his base at Tinmel in the Atlas Mountains. Under Abd al-Mu&#x27;min (r. 1130–1163), they succeeded in overthrowing the ruling Almoravid dynasty governing the western Maghreb in 1147, when he conquered Marrakesh and declared himself caliph. They then extended their power over all of the Maghreb by 1159. Al-Andalus followed, and all of Muslim Iberia was under Almohad rule by 1172.

The turning point of their presence in the Iberian Peninsula came in 1212, when Muhammad al-Nasir (1199–1214) was defeated at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in the Sierra Morena by an alliance of the Christian forces from Castile, Aragon and Navarre. Much of the remaining territories of al-Andalus were lost in the ensuing decades, with the cities of Córdoba and Seville falling to the Christians in 1236 and 1248 respectively.

The Almohads continued to rule in Africa until the piecemeal loss of territory through the revolt of tribes and districts enabled the rise of their most effective enemies, the Marinids in 1215. The last representative of the line, Idris al-Wathiq, was reduced to the possession of Marrakesh, where he was murdered by a slave in 1269; the Marinids seized Marrakesh, ending the Almohad domination of the Western Maghreb.

==History==
===Origins===
The Almohad movement originated with Ibn Tumart, a member of the Masmuda, an Amazigh tribal confederation of the Atlas Mountains of southern Morocco. At the time, present-day Morocco, Mauritania, western Algeria and parts of Spain and Portugal (al-Andalus) were under the rule of the Almoravids, a Sanhaja Berber dynasty. Early in his life, Ibn Tumart went to Spain to pursue his studies, and thereafter to Baghdad to deepen them. In Baghdad, Ibn Tumart attached himself to the theological school of al-Ash&#x27;ari, and came under the influence of the teacher al-Ghazali. He soon developed his own system, combining the doctrines of various masters. Ibn Tumart&#x27;s main principle was a strict unitarianism (&quot;tawhid&quot;), which denied the independent existence of the attributes of God as being incompatible with His unity, and therefore a polytheistic idea. Ibn Tumart represented a revolt against what he perceived as anthropomorphism in Muslim orthodoxy. His followers would become known as the &quot;al-Muwaḥḥidūn&quot; (&quot;Almohads&quot;), meaning those who affirm the unity of God.

After his return to the Maghreb c. 1117, Ibn Tumart spent some time in various Ifriqiyan cities, preaching and agitating, heading riotous attacks on wine-shops and on other manifestations of laxity. He laid the blame for the latitude on the ruling dynasty of the Almoravids, whom he accused of obscurantism and impiety. He also opposed their sponsorship of the Maliki school of jurisprudence, which drew upon consensus (&quot;ijma&quot;) and other sources beyond the Qur&#x27;an and Sunnah in their reasoning, an anathema to the stricter Zahirism favored by Ibn Tumart. His antics and fiery preaching led fed-up authorities to move him along from town to town. After being expelled from Bejaia, Ibn Tumart set up camp in Mellala, in the outskirts of the city, where he received his first disciples – notably, al-Bashir (who would become his chief strategist) and Abd al-Mu&#x27;min (a Zenata Berber of the Kumiya tribe who would later become his successor).

In 1120, Ibn Tumart and his small band of followers proceeded to Morocco, stopping first in Fez, where he briefly engaged the Maliki scholars of the city in debate. He even went so far as to assault the sister of the Almoravid emir Ali ibn Yusuf, in the streets of Fez, because she was going about unveiled, after the manner of Berber women. After being expelled from Fez, he went to Marrakesh, where he successfully tracked down the Almoravid emir Ali ibn Yusuf at a local mosque, and challenged the emir, and the leading scholars of the area, to a doctrinal debate. After the debate, the scholars concluded that Ibn Tumart&#x27;s views were blasphemous and the man dangerous, and urged him to be put to death or imprisoned. But the emir decided merely to expel him from the city.
Ibn Tumart took refuge among his own people, the Hargha, in his home village of Igiliz (exact location uncertain), in the Sous valley. He retreated to a nearby cave, and lived out an ascetic lifestyle, coming out only to preach his program of puritan reform, attracting greater and greater crowds. At length, towards the end of Ramadan in late 1121, after a particularly moving sermon, reviewing his failure to persuade the Almoravids to reform by argument, Ibn Tumart &#x27;revealed&#x27; himself as the true Mahdi, a divinely guided judge and lawgiver, and was recognized as such by his audience. This was effectively a declaration of war on the Almoravid state.

On the advice of one of his followers, Omar Hintati, a prominent chieftain of the Hintata, Ibn Tumart abandoned his cave in 1122 and went up into the High Atlas, to organize the Almohad movement among the highland Masmuda tribes. Besides his own tribe, the Hargha, Ibn Tumart secured the adherence of the Ganfisa, the Gadmiwa, the Hintata, the Haskura, and the Hazraja to the Almohad cause. Sometime around 1124, Ibn Tumart established his base at Tinmel, a highly defensible position in the valley of the Nfis in the High Atlas. Tinmal would serve both as the spiritual center and military headquarters of the Almohad movement. It became their (roughly &#x27;place of retreat&#x27;), emulating the story of the &quot;hijra&quot; (journey) of Muhammad&#x27;s to Medina in the 7th century.

For the first eight years, the Almohad rebellion was limited to a guerilla war along the peaks and ravines of the High Atlas. Their principal damage was in rendering insecure (or altogether impassable) the roads and mountain passes south of Marrakesh – threatening the route to all-important Sijilmassa, the gateway of the trans-Saharan trade. Unable to send enough manpower through the narrow passes to dislodge the Almohad rebels from their easily defended mountain strong points, the Almoravid authorities reconciled themselves to setting up strongholds to confine them there (most famously the fortress of Tasghîmût that protected the approach to Aghmat, which was conquered by the Almohads in 1132), while exploring alternative routes through more easterly passes.

Ibn Tumart organized the Almohads as a commune, with a minutely detailed structure. At the core was the &quot;Ahl ad-dār&quot; (&quot;House of the Mahdi&quot;), composed of Ibn Tumart&#x27;s family. This was supplemented by two councils: an inner Council of Ten, the Mahdi&#x27;s privy council, composed of his earliest and closest companions; and the consultative Council of Fifty, composed of the leading &quot;sheikh&quot;s of the Masmuda tribes. The early preachers and missionaries (&quot;ṭalaba&quot; and &quot;huffāẓ&quot;) also had their representatives. Militarily, there was a strict hierarchy of units. The Hargha tribe coming first (although not strictly ethnic; it included many &quot;honorary&quot; or &quot;adopted&quot; tribesmen from other ethnicities, e.g. Abd al-Mu&#x27;min himself). This was followed by the men of Tinmel, then the other Masmuda tribes in order, and rounded off by the black fighters, the &quot;ʻabīd&quot;. Each unit had a strict internal hierarchy, headed by a &quot;mohtasib&quot;, and divided into two factions: one for the early adherents, another for the late adherents, each headed by a &quot;mizwar&quot; (or &quot;amzwaru&quot;); then came the &quot;sakkakin&quot; (treasurers), effectively the money-minters, tax-collectors, and bursars, then came the regular army (&quot;jund&quot;), then the religious corps – the muezzins, the &quot;hafidh&quot; and the &quot;hizb&quot; – followed by the archers, the conscripts, and the slaves. Ibn Tumart&#x27;s closest companion and chief strategist, al-Bashir, took upon himself the role of &quot;political commissar&quot;, enforcing doctrinal discipline among the Masmuda tribesmen, often with a heavy hand.

In early 1130, the Almohads finally descended from the mountains for their first sizeable attack in the lowlands. It was a disaster for their opponents. The Almohads swept aside an Almoravid column that had come out to meet them before Aghmat, and then chased their remnant all the way to Marrakesh. They laid siege to Marrakesh for forty days until, in April (or May) 1130, the Almoravids sallied from the city and crushed the Almohads in the bloody Battle of al-Buhayra (named after a large garden east of the city). The Almohads were thoroughly routed, with huge losses. Half their leadership was killed in action, and the survivors only just managed to scramble back to the mountains.

=== Caliphate and expansion ===

Ibn Tumart died shortly after, in August 1130. That the Almohad movement did not immediately collapse after such a devastating defeat and the death of their charismatic Mahdi, is likely due to the skills of his successor, Abd al-Mu&#x27;min. Ibn Tumart&#x27;s death was kept a secret for three years, a period which Almohad chroniclers described as a &quot;ghayba&quot; or &quot;occultation&quot;. This period likely gave Abd al-Mu&#x27;min time to secure his position as successor to the political leadership of the movement. Although a Zenata Berber from Tagra (Algeria), and thus an alien among the Masmuda of southern Morocco, Abd al-Mu&#x27;min nonetheless saw off his principal rivals and hammered wavering tribes back to the fold. Three years after Ibn Tumart&#x27;s death he was officially proclaimed &quot;Caliph&quot;.

After 1133, Abd al-Mu&#x27;min quickly expanded Almohad control across the Maghreb, while the embattled Almoravids retained their capital in Marrakesh. Various other tribes rallied to the Almohads or to the Almoravids as the war between them continued. Initially, Almohad operations were limited to the Atlas mountains. In 1139, they expanded to the Rif mountains in the north. One of their early bases beyond the mountains was Taza, where Abd al-Mu&quot;min founded a citadel (&quot;ribat&quot;) and a Great Mosque circa 1142.

The Almoravid ruler, Ali ibn Yusuf, died in 1143 and was succeeded by his son, Tashfin ibn Ali. The tide turned more definitively in favour of the Almohads from 1144 onwards, when the Zenata tribes in what is now western Algeria joined the Almohad camp, along with some of the previously Almoravid-aligned leaders of the Masufa tribe. This allowed them to defeat Tashfin decisively and capture Tlemcen in 1144. Tashfin fled to Oran, which the Almohads then attacked and captured, and he died in March 1145 while trying to escape. The Almohads pursued the defeated Almoravid army west to Fez, which they captured in 1146 after a nine-month siege. They finally captured Marrakesh in 1147, after an eleven-month siege. The last Almoravid ruler, Ishaq ibn Ali, was killed.

In 1151, Abd al-Mu&#x27;min launched an expedition to the east. This may have been encouraged by the Norman conquests along the coast of Ifriqiya, as fighting the Christian invaders here gave him a pretext for conquering the rest of the region. In August 1152, he captured Béjaïa, the capital of the Hammadids. The last Hammadid ruler, Yahya ibn Abd al-Aziz, fled by sea. The Arab tribes of the region, the Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym, reacted to the Almohad advance by gathering an army against them. The Almohads routed them in the Battle of Sétif in April 1153. Abd al-Mu&#x27;min nonetheless saw value in their military abilities. He persuaded them by various means – including taking some families as hostages to Marrakesh and more generous actions like offering them material and land incentives – to move to present-day Morocco and join the Almohad armies. These moves also had the corollary effect of advancing the Arabisation of future Morocco.

Abd al-Mu&#x27;min spent the mid-1150s organizing the Almohad state and arranging for power to be passed on through his family line. In 1154, he declared his son Muhammad as his heir. In order to neutralise the power of the Masmuda, he relied on his tribe of origin, the Kumiyas (from the central Maghreb), whom he integrated into the Almohad power structure and from whom he recruited some 40,000 into the army. They would later form the bodyguard of the caliph and his successors. In addition, Abd al-Mu&#x27;min relied on Arabs, the great Hilalian families that he had deported to Morocco, to further weaken the influence of the Masmuda sheikhs.

With his son appointed as his successor, Abd al-Mu&#x27;min placed his other children as governors of the provinces of the caliphate. His sons and descendants became known as the &quot;sayyid&quot;s (&quot;nobles&quot;). To appease the traditional Masmuda elites, he appointed some of them, along with theirs sons and descendants, to act as important advisers, deputies, and commanders under the &quot;sayyid&quot;s. They became known as the or &quot;Sons of the Almohads&quot;. Abd al-Mu&#x27;min also altered the Almohad structure set up by Ibn Tumart by making the &quot;huffaz&quot; or reciters of the Quran into a training school of the Almohad elite. They were no longer described as &quot;memorisers&quot; but as &quot;guardians&quot; who learned riding, swimming, archery, and received a general education of high standards.

Abd al-Mu&#x27;min thus transformed the Almohad movement from a Masmuda aristocracy to a Mu&#x27;minid dynastic state. While most of the Almohad elites accepted this new concentration of power, it nonetheless triggered an uprising by two of Ibn Tumart&#x27;s half-brothers, &#x27;Abd al-&#x27;Aziz and &#x27;Isa. Shortly after Abd al-Mu&#x27;min announced his heir, towards 1154–1155, they rebelled in Fez and then marched on Marrakesh, whose governor they killed. Abd al-Mu&#x27;min, who had been in Salé, returned to the city, defeated the rebels, and had everyone involved executed.

In March 1159, Abd al-Mu&#x27;min led a new campaign to the east. He conquered Tunis by force when the local Banu Khurasan leaders refused to surrender. Mahdia was besieged soon after and surrendered in January 1160. The Normans there negotiated their withdrawal and were allowed to leave for Sicily. Tripoli, which had rebelled against the Normans two years earlier, recognized Almohad authority right after.

In the 1170s and 1180s, Almohad power in the eastern Maghreb was challenged by the Banu Ghaniya and by Qaraqush, an Ayyubid commander. Yaqub al-Mansur eventually defeated both factions and reconquered Ifriqiya in 1187–1188. In 1189–1190, the Ayyubid sultan Salah ad-Din (Saladin) requested the assistance of an Almohad navy for his fight against the crusaders, which al-Mansur declined.

===Expansion into al-Andalus===

Al-Andalus followed the fate of North Africa. Between 1146 and 1173, the Almohads gradually wrested control from the Almoravids over the Muslim principalities in Iberia. The Almohads transferred the capital of Muslim Iberia from Córdoba to Seville. They founded a great mosque there; its tower, the Giralda, was erected in 1184. The Almohads also built a palace there called Al-Muwarak on the site of the modern-day Alcázar of Seville.

The successors of Abd al-Mumin, Abu Yaqub Yusuf (Yusuf I, ruled 1163–1184) and Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur (Yaʻqūb I, ruled 1184–1199), were both able men. Initially their government drove many Jewish and Christian subjects to take refuge in the growing Christian states of Portugal, Castile, and Aragon. Ultimately they became less fanatical than the Almoravids, and Ya&#x27;qub al-Mansur was a highly accomplished man who wrote a good Arabic style and protected the philosopher Averroes. In 1190–1191, he campaigned in southern Portugal and won back territory lost in 1189. His title of &quot;al-Manṣūr&quot; (&quot;the Victorious&quot;) was earned by his victory over Alfonso VIII of Castile in the Battle of Alarcos (1195).

From the time of Yusuf II, however, the Almohads governed their co-religionists in Iberia and central North Africa through lieutenants, their dominions outside Morocco being treated as provinces. When Almohad emirs crossed the Straits it was to lead a jihad against the Christians and then return to Morocco.

===Holding years===
In 1212, the Almohad Caliph Muhammad &#x27;al-Nasir&#x27; (1199–1214), the successor of al-Mansur, after an initially successful advance north, was defeated by an alliance of the three Christian kings of Castile, Aragón and Navarre at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in the Sierra Morena. The battle broke the Almohad advance, but the Christian powers remained too disorganized to profit from it immediately.

Before his death in 1213, al-Nasir appointed his young ten-year-old son as the next caliph Yusuf II &quot;al-Mustansir&quot;. The Almohads passed through a period of effective regency for the young caliph, with power exercised by an oligarchy of elder family members, palace bureaucrats and leading nobles. The Almohad ministers were careful to negotiate a series of truces with the Christian kingdoms, which remained more-or-less in place for next fifteen years (the loss of Alcácer do Sal to the Kingdom of Portugal in 1217 was an exception).

In early 1224, the youthful caliph died in an accident, without any heirs. The palace bureaucrats in Marrakesh, led by the &quot;wazir&quot; Uthman ibn Jam&#x27;i, quickly engineered the election of his elderly grand-uncle, Abd al-Wahid I &#x27;al-Makhlu&#x27;, as the new Almohad caliph. But the rapid appointment upset other branches of the family, notably the brothers of the late al-Nasir, who governed in al-Andalus. The challenge was immediately raised by one of them, then governor in Murcia, who declared himself Caliph Abdallah al-Adil. With the help of his brothers, he quickly seized control of al-Andalus. His chief advisor, the shadowy Abu Zayd ibn Yujjan, tapped into his contacts in Marrakesh, and secured the deposition and assassination of Abd al-Wahid I, and the expulsion of the al-Jami&#x27;i clan.

This coup has been characterized as the pebble that finally broke al-Andalus. It was the first internal coup among the Almohads. The Almohad clan, despite occasional disagreements, had always remained tightly knit and loyally behind dynastic precedence. Caliph al-Adil&#x27;s murderous breach of dynastic and constitutional propriety marred his acceptability to other Almohad &quot;sheikhs&quot;. One of the recusants was his cousin, Abd Allah al-Bayyasi (&quot;the Baezan&quot;), the Almohad governor of Jaén, who took a handful of followers and decamped for the hills around Baeza. He set up a rebel camp and forged an alliance with the hitherto quiet Ferdinand III of Castile. Sensing his greater priority was Marrakesh, where recusant Almohad &quot;sheikh&quot;s had rallied behind Yahya, another son of al-Nasir, al-Adil paid little attention to them.

=== Decline in al-Andalus ===
In 1225, Abd Allah al-Bayyasi&#x27;s band of rebels, accompanied by a large Castilian army, descended from the hills, besieging cities such as Jaén and Andújar. They raided throughout the regions of Jaén, Cordova and Vega de Granada and, before the end of the year, al-Bayyasi had established himself in the city of Cordova. Sensing a power vacuum, both Alfonso IX of León and Sancho II of Portugal opportunistically ordered raids into Andalusian territory that same year. With Almohad arms, men and cash dispatched to Morocco to help Caliph al-Adil impose himself in Marrakesh, there was little means to stop the sudden onslaught. In late 1225, with surprising ease, the Portuguese raiders reached the environs of Seville. Knowing they were outnumbered, the Almohad governors of the city refused to confront the Portuguese raiders, prompting the disgusted population of Seville to take matters into their own hands, raise a militia, and go out in the field by themselves. The result was a veritable massacre – the Portuguese men-at-arms easily mowed down the throng of poorly armed townsfolk. Thousands, perhaps as much as 20,000, were said to have been slain before the walls of Seville. A similar disaster befell a similar popular levy by Murcians at Aspe that same year. But Christian raiders had been stopped at Cáceres and Requena. Trust in the Almohad leadership was severely shaken by these events – the disasters were promptly blamed on the distractions of Caliph al-Adil and the incompetence and cowardice of his lieutenants, the successes credited to non-Almohad local leaders who rallied defenses.

But al-Adil&#x27;s fortunes were briefly buoyed. In payment for Castilian assistance, al-Bayyasi had given Ferdinand III three strategic frontier fortresses: Baños de la Encina, Salvatierra (the old Order of Calatrava fortress near Ciudad Real) and Capilla. But Capilla refused to hand them over, forcing the Castilians to lay a long and difficult siege. The brave defiance of little Capilla, and the spectacle of al-Bayyasi&#x27;s shipping provisions to the Castilian besiegers, shocked Andalusians and shifted sentiment back towards the Almohad caliph. A popular uprising broke out in Cordova – al-Bayyasi was killed and his head dispatched as a trophy to Marrakesh. But Caliph al-Adil did not rejoice in this victory for long – he was assassinated in Marrakesh in October 1227, by the partisans of Yahya, who was promptly acclaimed as the new Almohad caliph Yahya &quot;al-Mu&#x27;tasim&quot;.

The Andalusian branch of the Almohads refused to accept this turn of events. Al-Adil&#x27;s brother, then in Seville, proclaimed himself the new Almohad caliph Abd al-Ala Idris I &#x27;al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;. He promptly purchased a truce from Ferdinand III in return for 300,000 &quot;maravedis&quot;, allowing him to organize and dispatch the greater part of the Almohad army in Spain across the straits in 1228 to confront Yahya.

That same year, Portuguese and Leonese renewed their raids deep into Muslim territory, basically unchecked. Feeling the Almohads had failed to protect them, popular uprisings took place throughout al-Andalus. City after city deposed their hapless Almohad governors and installed local strongmen in their place. A Murcian strongman, Muhammad ibn Yusuf ibn Hud al-Judhami, who claimed descendance from the Banu Hud dynasty that had once ruled the old taifa of Saragossa, emerged as the central figure of these rebellions, systematically dislodging Almohad garrisons through central Spain. In October 1228, with Spain practically all lost, al-Ma&#x27;mun abandoned Seville, taking what little remained of the Almohad army with him to Morocco. Ibn Hud immediately dispatched emissaries to distant Baghdad to offer recognition to the Abbasid Caliph, albeit taking up for himself a quasi-caliphal title, &#x27;al-Mutawwakil&#x27;.
The departure of al-Ma&#x27;mun in 1228 marked the end of the Almohad era in Spain. Ibn Hud and the other local Andalusian strongmen were unable to stem the rising flood of Christian attacks, launched almost yearly by Sancho II of Portugal, Alfonso IX of León, Ferdinand III of Castile and James I of Aragon. The next twenty years saw a massive advance in the Christian reconquista – the old great Andalusian citadels fell in a grand sweep: Mérida and Badajoz in 1230 (to Leon), Majorca in 1230 (to Aragon), Beja in 1234 (to Portugal), Cordova in 1236 (to Castile), Valencia in 1238 (to Aragon), Niebla-Huelva in 1238 (to Leon), Silves in 1242 (to Portugal), Murcia in 1243 (to Castile), Jaén in 1246 (to Castile), Alicante in 1248 (to Castile), culminating in the fall of the greatest of Andalusian cities, the ex-Almohad capital of Seville, into Christian hands in 1248. Ferdinand III of Castile entered Seville as a conqueror on December 22, 1248.

The Andalusians were helpless before this onslaught. Ibn Hud had attempted to check the Leonese advance early on, but most of his Andalusian army was destroyed at the battle of Alange in 1230. Ibn Hud scrambled to move remaining arms and men to save threatened or besieged Andalusian citadels, but with so many attacks at once, it was a hopeless endeavor. After Ibn Hud&#x27;s death in 1238, some of the Andalusian cities, in a last-ditch effort to save themselves, offered themselves once again to the Almohads, but to no avail. The Almohads would not return.

With the departure of the Almohads, the Nasrid dynasty (&quot;Banū Naṣr&quot;, ) rose to power in Granada. After the great Christian advance of 1228–1248, the Emirate of Granada was practically all that remained of old al-Andalus. Some of the captured citadels (e.g. Murcia, Jaen, Niebla) were reorganized as tributary vassals for a few more years, but most were annexed by the 1260s. Granada alone would remain independent for an additional 250 years, flourishing as the new center of al-Andalus.

===Collapse in the Maghreb===
In their African holdings, the Almohads encouraged the establishment of Christians even in Fez, and after the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa they occasionally entered into alliances with the kings of Castile. The history of their decline differs from that of the Almoravids, whom they had displaced. They were not assailed by a great religious movement, but lost territories, piecemeal, by the revolt of tribes and districts. Their most effective enemies were the Banu Marin (Marinids) who founded the next dynasty. The last representative of the line, Idris al-Wathiq, was reduced to the possession of Marrakesh, where he was murdered by a slave in 1269.

==Culture==
=== Language ===
The use of Berber languages was important in Almohad doctrine. Under the Almohads, the &quot;khuṭba&quot; (sermon) at Friday prayer was made to be delivered in Arabic and Berber, with the latter referred to as &quot;al-lisān al-gharbī&quot; () by the Andalusi historian . For example, the &quot;khaṭīb&quot;, or sermon-giver, of al-Qarawiyyīn Mosque in Fes, Mahdī b. &#x27;Īsā, was replaced under the Almohads by Abū l-Ḥasan b. &#x27;Aṭiyya khaṭīb because he was fluent in Berber.

As the Almohads rejected the status of &quot;Dhimma&quot;, the Almohad conquest of al-Andalus caused the emigration of Andalusi Christians from southern Iberia to the Christian north, which had an impact on the use of Romance within Almohad territory. After the Almohad period, Muslim territories in Iberia were reduced to the Emirate of Granada, in which the percentage of the population that had converted to Islam reached 90% and Arabic-Romance bilingualism seems to have disappeared.

The French Orientalist Georges-Séraphin Colin—based on a collection of Almohad-era texts heavily influenced by vernacular speech, edited by Évariste Lévi-Provençal—identifies various points of contact and divergence between Andalusi Arabic and Maghrebi Arabic in the Almohad period.

=== Literature ===
The Almohads worked to suppress the influence of the Maliki school of fiqh, even publicly burning copies of &quot;Muwatta Imam Malik&quot; and Maliki commentaries. They sought to disseminate ibn Tumart&#x27;s beliefs; he was the author of the &quot;Aʿazzu Mā Yuṭlab&quot;, the &quot;Counterpart of the Muwatta&quot; (), and the &quot;Compendium of Sahih Muslim&quot; ().

Literary production continued despite the Almohad reforms&#x27;s devastating effect on cultural life in their domain. Almohad universities continued the knowledge of preceding Andalusi scholars as well as ancient Greek and Roman writers; contemporary literary figures included Averroes, Hafsa bint al-Hajj al-Rukuniyya, ibn Tufayl, ibn Zuhr, ibn al-Abbar, ibn Amira and many more poets, philosophers, and scholars. The abolishment of the dhimmi status of religious minorities further stifled the once flourishing Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain; Maimonides went east and many Jews moved to Castillian-controlled Toledo.

According to the research of Muhammad al-Manuni, there were 400 paper mills in Fes under the reign of Sultan Yaqub al-Mansur in the 12th century.

=== Theology and philosophy ===
The Almohad ideology preached by Ibn Tumart is described by Amira Bennison as a &quot;sophisticated hybrid form of Islam that wove together strands from Hadith science, Zahiri and Shafi&#x27;i &quot;fiqh&quot;, Ghazalian social actions (&quot;hisba&quot;), and spiritual engagement with Shi&#x27;i notions of the imam and &quot;mahdi&quot;&quot;. This contrasted with the highly orthodox or traditionalist Maliki school (&quot;maddhab&quot;) of Sunni Islam which predominated in the region up to that point. Central to his philosophy, Ibn Tumart preached a fundamentalist or radical version of &quot;tawhid&quot; – referring to a strict monotheism or to the &quot;oneness of God&quot;. This notion gave the movement its name: &quot;al&quot;-&quot;Muwaḥḥidūn&quot; (), meaning roughly &quot;those who advocate &quot;tawhid&quot;&quot;, which was adapted to &quot;Almohads&quot; in European writings. Ibn Tumart saw his movement as a revolutionary reform movement much as early Islam saw itself relative to the Christianity and Judaism which preceded it, with himself as its &quot;mahdi&quot; and leader.

In terms of Muslim jurisprudence, the state gave recognition to the Zahiri () school of thought, though Shafi&#x27;ites were also given a measure of authority at times. While not all Almohad leaders were Zahirites, quite a few of them were not only adherents of the legal school but also well-versed in its tenets. Additionally, all Almohad leaders – both the religiously learned and the laymen – were hostile toward the Malikite school favored by the Almoravids. During the reign of Abu Yaqub, chief judge Ibn Maḍāʾ oversaw the banning of all religious books written by non-Zahirites; when Abu Yaqub&#x27;s son Abu Yusuf took the throne, he ordered Ibn Maḍāʾ to undertake the actual burning of such books.

In terms of Islamic theology, the Almohads were Ash&#x27;arites, their Zahirite-Ash&#x27;arism giving rise to a complicated blend of literalist jurisprudence and esoteric dogmatics. Some authors occasionally describe Almohads as heavily influenced by Mu&#x27;tazilism. Scholar Madeline Fletcher argues that while one of Ibn Tumart&#x27;s original teachings, the &quot;murshida&quot;s (a collection of sayings memorized by his followers), holds positions on the attributes of God which might be construed as moderately Mu&#x27;tazilite (and which were criticized as such by Ibn Taimiyya), identifying him with Mu&#x27;tazilites would be an exaggeration. She points out that another of his main texts, the &quot;&#x27;aqida&quot; (which was likely edited by others after him), demonstrates a much clearer Ash&#x27;arite position on a number of issues.

Nonetheless, the Almohads, particularly from the reign of Caliph Abu Yusuf Ya&#x27;qub al-Mansur onward, embraced the use of logical reasoning as a method of validating the more central Almohad concept of &quot;tawhid&quot;. This effectively provided a religious justification for philosophy and for a rationalist intellectualism in Almohad religious thought. Al-Mansur&#x27;s father, Abu Ya&#x27;qub Yusuf, had also shown some favour towards philosophy and kept the philosopher Ibn Tufayl as his confidant. Ibn Tufayl in turn introduced Ibn Rush (Averroes) to the Almohad court, to whom Al-Mansur gave patronage and protection. Although Ibn Rushd (who was also an Islamic judge) saw rationalism and philosophy as complementary to religion and revelation, his views failed to convince the traditional Maliki &quot;ulema&quot;, with whom the Almohads were already at odds. After the decline of Almohadism, Maliki Sunnism ultimately became the dominant official religious doctrine of the region. By contrast, the teachings of Ibn Rushd and other philosophers like him were far more influential for Jewish philosophers – including Maimonides, his contemporary – and Christian Latin scholars – like Thomas Aquinas – who later promoted his commentaries on Aristotle.

=== Emblem ===

Most historical records indicate that the Almohads were recognized for their use of white banners, which were supposed to evoke their &quot;purity of purpose&quot;. This began a long tradition of using white as main dynastic color in what is now Morocco for the later Marinids and Saadian sultanates. Whether these white banners contained any specific motifs or inscriptions is not certain. Historian Ḥasan &#x27;Ali Ḥasan writes:

According to historian Amira Benninson, the caliphs usually left their capital Marrakesh for war in al-Andalus preceded by the white banner of the Almohads, the Quran of &#x27;Uthman and Quran of Ibn Tumart. Egyptian historiographer Al-Qalqashandi (d. 1418) mentioned white flags in two places, the first being when he spoke about the Almohad flag in Tunisia, where he stated that: &quot;It was a white flag called the victorious flag, and it was raised before their sultan when riding for Eid prayers or for the movement of the makhzen slaves (which were the ordinary people of the country and the people of the markets)&quot;. By the end of the Almohad reign, dissident movements would adopt black in recognition of the Abbasid caliphate and in rejection of the Almohad authority.

The &quot;Book of Knowledge of All Kingdoms&quot;, written by a Franciscan friar in the 14th century (well after the end of the Almohad period), describes the flag of Marrakesh as being red with a black-and-white checkerboard motif at its center. Some authors have assumed this flag to be the former flag of the Almohads.

In modern times, Islamic al-Andalus in Andalusian collective memory allowed more awareness of the colors of the Andalusian flag, chosen in 1918 by Blas Infante, a founding figure of Andalusia. Infante has explained the design of its flag by indicating that green was the color of the Umayyads and white that of the Almohads, the caliphates which represented periods of &quot;greatness and power&quot; in this region.

==== Calligraphy and manuscripts ====
The Almohad dynasty embraced a style of cursive Maghrebi script known today as &quot;Maghrebi thuluth&quot; as an official style used in manuscripts, coinage, documents, and architecture. However, the more angular Kufic script was still used, albeit in a reworked form in Qur&#x27;an epigraphy, and was seen detailed in silver in some colophons. The Maghrebi thuluth script, frequently written in gold, was used to give emphasis when standard writing, written in rounded Maghrebi mabsūt script, was considered insufficient. Maghrebi mabsūt of the al-Andalus region during the 12th to 14th centuries was characterized by elongated lines, stretched out curves, and the use of multiple colors for vocalizations, as derived from the people of Medina.

Scribes and calligraphers of the Almohad period also started to illuminate words and phrases in manuscripts for emphasis, using gold leaf and lapis lazuli. While much of the script was written in black or brown ink, the use of polychromy for diacritical text and vocalizations also marked a departure from previous caliphates&#x27; calligraphic styles. Blue dots were used to indicate elif, orange dots denoted hamza, and yellow semicircles to marked shaddah. Separate sets of verses were denoted by various medallions, with distinctive designs for each set. For example, sets of five verses were ended with bud-like medallions while sets of ten were marked by circular medallions, all of which were typically painted in gold. Manuscripts attributed to this caliphate were characterized by interlacing geometric or recti-curvilinear illuminations, and abstract vegetal artwork and large medallions were often present in the margins and as thumbnails. Composite floral finials were also frequently used in decorating the margins and corners of the page. Color schemes focused on primarily using gold, white, and blue, with accentuating elements in red or pink.

During the Almohad dynasty, the act of bookbinding itself took on great importance, with a notable instance of the Almohad caliph Abd al-Mu&#x27;min bringing in artisans for a celebration of the binding of a Qur&#x27;an imported from Cordoba. Books were most frequently bound in goatskin leather and decorated with polygonal interlacing, goffering, and stamping. The primary materials used for the pages were goat or sheep vellum. However, the Almohad dynasty also saw industrial advancements in the spread of paper mills in Seville and Marrakesh, leading to the introduction of paper for Qur&#x27;an manuscripts, illuminated doctrine books, and official documents. Most Qur&#x27;anic manuscripts were close to square-shaped, though other religious texts were typically vertically oriented. With the exception of a few large-scale Qur&#x27;ans, most were modestly sized, ranging from 11 centimenters to 22 centimeters on each side, with 19 to 27 lines of script each page. In contrast, large-sized Qur&#x27;ans were typically approximately 60 centimeters by 53 centimeters and had an average of five to nine lines of script to a page, typically in Maghrebi thuluth.

Hadith Bayāḍ wa Riyāḍ, the love story of Bayad and Riyad, is one of the few remaining illustrated manuscripts dated to 13th century Almohad caliphate. Its use of miniatures displays a clear connection with previous illustrated tradition from the eastern Islamic world. However, it deviates in its depictions of the frontispiece, interior, and teaching scenes, which show similarities to scientific manuscripts from the central Islamic world, typically considered to have consisted of the Arabian peninsula, northeast modern Iran, and the Fertile Crescent. Depictions of architecture specific to the Almohad caliphate are also evident in several places in the manuscript.The penultimate Almohad caliph, Abu Hafs al-Murtada, was a notable calligrapher in his own right and composed poems and copied Qur&#x27;ans. A known bibliophile, he frequently endowed books to madrasas and mosques and established the first public manuscript transcription center in Marrakesh. One of the large Qur&#x27;ans that he copied has been preserved in Marrakesh and is the oldest surviving example in the western Islamic world of a Qur&#x27;an personally produced by a sovereign ruler. The 10-volume tome is written on parchment and bound with a leather cover decorated with a geometric motif, exhibiting the first dated use of gold tooling on a manuscript binding. The verses are written in Maghrebi mabsūt script and the end of each verse is marked by a gold circle divided into eight uniform segments. Using large Maghrebi script, there are five to 10 lines to a page, with relatively few words to each line. There is lavish use of gold, and this Qur&#x27;an, as with other Qur&#x27;ans of this size, was likely intended for court use.

==== Textiles ====
The Almohads initially eschewed the production of luxury textiles and silks, but eventually they too engaged in this production. Almohad textiles, like earlier Almoravid examples, were often decorated with a grid of roundels filled with ornamental designs or Arabic epigraphy. However, textiles produced by Almohad workshops used progressively less figural decoration than previous Almoravid textiles, in favour of interlacing geometric and vegetal motifs.

One of the best-known textiles traditionally attributed to the Almohads is the &quot;Las Navas de Tolosa Banner&quot;, so-called because it was once thought to be a spoil won by Alfonso VIII at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212. More recent studies have proposed that it was actually a spoil won some years later by Ferdinand III. The banner was then donated to the Monastery of Santa Maria la Real de Huelgas in Burgos, where it remains today. The banner is richly designed and features blue Arabic inscriptions and white decorative patterns on a red background. The central motif features an eight-pointed star framed by a circle inside a larger square, with smaller motifs filling the bands of the frame and the corner spaces. This central design is surrounded on four sides by Arabic inscriptions in Naskhi script featuring Qur&#x27;anic verses (&quot;Surah&quot; 61: 10–12), and another horizontal inscription in the banner&#x27;s upper part which praises God and Muhammad. Recent studies have argued that the banner is of 14th century origin rather than of Almohad origin, due to its similarities with captured Marinid banners kept at the Cathedral of Toledo and to its similarities with Nasrid motifs. It remains uncertain whether it was crafted either in Fez under the Marinids or in Granada under the Nasrids.
==== Metalwork ====

The French historian Henri Terrasse described al-Qarawiyyin&#x27;s bronze grand chandelier, commissioned by Caliph Muhammad al-Nasir, as &quot;the largest and most beautiful chandelier in the Islamic world.&quot; The chandelier consists of a 12-sided copula on top of which is mounted a large cone crowned around its sides with nine levels of candlesticks. The visible surfaces of the chandelier are carved and pierced with intricate floral arabesque motifs as well as Kufic Arabic inscriptions. The chandelier is now the oldest surviving chandelier in the western Islamic world, and it likely served as a model for the later and nearly equally famous Marinid chandelier in the Great Mosque of Taza.

Another important piece, the so-called Monzón Lion, also dates from the Almohad period during the 12 or 13th century and is held in the Louvre Museum today. It is an example of figural bronze sculpture from al-Andalus that continues in the tradition of earlier objects such as the 11th-century Pisa Griffin (kept at the Cathedral Museum of Pisa) and the 10th-century Stag of Córdoba made in Madinat al-Zahra (now kept at the Archeological Museum of Córdoba). It was found in Monzón, near Palencia, but it is not known where exactly in the Iberian Peninsula it was made. As Palencia was outside the Almohad realm, it may have been made by Andalusi craftsman for a Christian patron. The lion, which served as a fountainhead, is sculpted in a highly stylized manner and its articulated tail is adjustable. Its surface is covered in incised decoration consisting of tapestry-like motifs, and a broad Kufic inscription on its side features well-wishes for its owner.

Other surviving metalwork objects from the Almohad period include a series of braziers and lamps discovered in Córdoba and now kept at the Archeological Museum of Córdoba. One of them, a hexagonal brazier, features both incised and pierced decoration. Along with prominent decorative Kufic inscriptions, it has an architectural motif of merlons resembling the decorative sawtooth-shaped merlons found along the tops of Moorish and Moroccan buildings of the same period.

==== Ceramics and tilework ====

Jonathan Bloom cites the white and green glazed tiles on the minaret of the Kutubiyya Mosque, dating from the mid-12th century in the early Almohad period, as the earliest reliably-dated example of &quot;zellij&quot; in Morocco. The tiles currently installed on the minaret are modern reproductions of the original decoration, but some of the original tiles were preserved in a collection kept at the Badi Palace. The same collection has also preserved fragments of the original tile decoration on the minaret of the Kasbah Mosque, including fragments of a Kufic inscription which is no longer present on the minaret today. These latter fragments are also the earliest surviving example of &quot;cuerda seca&quot; tilework (a technique originating in al-Andalus) being used in an architectural context.

==== Painted decoration ====
The Kutubiyya Mosque&#x27;s minaret in Marrakesh originally had polychrome painted decoration around the windows and blind arches on its exterior façades, featuring a mix of geometric and vegetal arabesque motifs. In Seville, some Almohad-era houses have been excavated in various locations in the city, particularly on the site of the present-day cathedral. At least one of these excavations have revealed the remains of mural decoration featuring interlacing geometric decoration. Decorations of a hammam dating back to the Almohad period were uncovered in a bar in Seville during renovations in 2020. The decorations feature red ochre paintings of concave hexadecagons and eightfold rosettes on engraved white lime mortar in a pattern that fits the hammam&#x27;s geometric skylight holes.

=== Architecture ===
Along with the Almoravid period preceding it, the Almohad period is considered one of the most formative stages of Moroccan and Moorish architecture, establishing many of the forms and motifs that were refined in subsequent centuries. The main sites of Almohad architecture and art include Fes, Marrakesh, Rabat and Seville. In general, Almohad architecture was built mostly in rammed earth and brick rather than stone. These two materials were relatively cheap, readily available at most sites, and already widely used in the preceding centuries. Almohad architects refined both the manufacturing process of these materials and their on-site assembly, making the execution of numerous and ambitious construction projects possible. According to scholar Felix Arnold, during the Almohad period &quot;construction became an industry on a scale not seen since Roman times.&quot;

Compared to the earlier Almoravid period and the Taifas or Caliphal period in al-Andalus, early Almohad architecture was much more restrained in its ornamentation, focusing its attention on overall architectural forms rather than on detailed surface decoration. In addition to continuing the integration of Moroccan and Andalusi artistic traditions, some currents in Almohad architecture may also reflect influences from Algeria and Tunisia (Ifriqiya). Some Almohad elements, such as polylobed arches, have their earliest precedents in Fatimid architecture in Ifriqiya and Egypt and had also appeared in Andalusi architecture such as the Aljaferia palace. In the Almohad period, this type of arch was further refined for decorative functions while horseshoe arches continued to be standard elsewhere. The decoration around &quot;mihrab&quot; arches inside mosques also evolved into richer and more monumental forms in the great ceremonial stone gates of Almohad architecture such as Bab Agnaou in Marrakesh and Bab Oudaia and Bab er-Rouah in Rabat. These gates employed varying decorative motifs arranged in concentric semi-circles around the arch of the gate, all of which was in turn framed inside an outer rectangular band with other motifs. This style remained evident in Marinid gateways (e.g. the main gate of Chellah) and in later Moroccan gateways.

The Almohad Kutubiyya and Tinmal mosques are often considered the prototypes of later Moroccan and Andalusi mosques, although the Great Mosque of Taza (later modified by the Marinids) is the oldest surviving Almohad mosque (begun in 1142). Like earlier mosques in the region, Almohad mosques have interiors consisting of large hypostyle halls divided by rows of arches that create a repetitive visual effect. However, the aisle or &quot;nave&quot; leading towards the &quot;mihrab&quot; (niche symbolizing the &quot;qibla&quot; in the southern/southeastern wall) and the aisle running along the qibla wall itself were usually wider than the others and were highlighted with distinctive arches and greater decoration. This layout, already present in Almoravid mosques, is often referred to as the &quot;T-plan&quot; by art historians (because the aisle running parallel to the &quot;qibla&quot; wall and the aisle leading to the &quot;mihrab&quot;, perpendicular to it, form a &quot;T&quot; shape), and became standard in mosques of the region for centuries. The minarets of Almohad mosques also established the standard form and style of subsequent minarets in the region, with a square base and two-tiered shaft covered in polylobed arch and &quot;darj wa ktaf&quot; motifs. The minaret of the Kasbah Mosque of Marrakesh was particularly influential and set a style that was repeated, with minor elaborations, in the following Marinid period. The most famous minarets of this time, however, are the minarets of the Kutubiyya Mosque (begun in 1147 by Abd al-Mu&#x27;min but subsequently rebuilt before 1195), the Giralda of Seville (part of a Great Mosque begun in 1171 by Abu Ya&#x27;qub Yusuf), and the unfinished &quot;Hassan Tower&quot; of Rabat (part of a huge mosque begun by Abu Yusuf Ya&#x27;qub al-Mansur in 1191 but never completed).

The Almohads were also prolific builders of fortifications and forts across their realm. They were responsible for building (or rebuilding) the city walls of Cordoba, Seville, Fes, and Taza, as well as many smaller forts and castles across Morocco and southern Spain and Portugal. In Rabat, Abd al-Mu&#x27;min built most of the current Kasbah of the Udayas in 1150–1151 (after having destroyed an earlier Almoravid &quot;ribat&quot; there), while Abu Yusuf Ya&#x27;qub al-Mansur embarked on the construction of a vast new capital and citadel on its south side called &quot;Ribat al-Fath&quot; (for which the enormous unfinished mosque of the Hassan Tower was also intended). While never finished, this project created the current outer walls of the historic center of Rabat, along with multiple gates such as Bab er-Rouah and the ceremonial main gate of the Kasbah of the Udayas. Al-Mansur also created the Kasbah of Marrakesh, a large royal citadel and palace complex to house the caliph&#x27;s family and administration. The main public entrance of this kasbah was the ornamental gate of Bab Agnaou. In Seville, the Almohads built the Torre del Oro, a defensive tower on the shores of the Guadalquivir River which dates from 1220 to 1221 and remains a landmark of the city today. Likewise, the Calahorra Tower in Cordoba is believed to be an originally Almohad structure designed to defend the river and the city&#x27;s old bridge.

The Almohad caliphs also constructed multiple country estates just outside the main cities where they resided, continuing a tradition that existed under the Almoravids. The best-known examples of these estates were centered around large water basins or reservoirs that sustained orchards of fruit trees and other plants. Some of them are referred to as &quot;al-Buḥayra&quot; (&quot;little sea&quot;) in Arabic sources, likely in reference to these artificial lakes. Small palaces or pleasure pavilions were built on the edge of the reservoirs. In Marrakesh, the present-day Agdal and Menara gardens both developed from such Almohad creations. In Seville, the remains of the &quot;al-Buḥayra&quot; garden, founded in 1171, were excavated and partly restored in the 1970s. A similar garden estate was also created in Rabat but has not been found by archaeologists. The Alcázar Genil (originally called &quot;al-Qaṣr as-Sayyid&quot;) in Granada, created in the late Almohad period and later remodeled by the Nasrids, stood next to an enormous pool on the outskirts of the city. A small ribat, consisting of a square hall covered by a sixteen-sided dome on squinches, was built nearby at the same time and has been preserved today as a Christian hermitage. Sunken gardens were also part of Almohad palace architecture. In some cases the gardens were divided symmetrically into four parts, much like a &quot;riyad&quot; garden. Examples of these have been found in several courtyards in the Alcázar of Seville, where former Almohad palaces once stood.

==Status of Non-Muslims==
The Almohads had taken control of the Almoravid Maghribi and Andalusian territories by 1147. The Almohads rejected the mainstream Islamic doctrine that established the status of &quot;dhimmi&quot;, a Non-Muslim resident of a Muslim country who was allowed to practice his religion on condition of submission to Muslim rule and payment of &quot;jizya&quot;.

The treatment and persecution of Jews under Almohad rule was a drastic change. Prior to Almohad rule during the Caliphate of Córdoba, Jewish culture experienced a Golden Age. María Rosa Menocal, a specialist in Iberian literature at Yale University, has argued that &quot;tolerance was an inherent aspect of Andalusian society&quot;, and that the Jewish &quot;dhimmi&quot;s living under the Caliphate, while allowed fewer rights than Muslims, were still better off than in Christian Europe. Many Jews migrated to &quot;al-Andalus&quot;, where they were not just tolerated but allowed to practice their faith openly. Christians had also practiced their religion openly in Córdoba, and both Jews and Christians lived openly in Morocco as well.

The first Almohad ruler, Abd al-Mumin, allowed an initial seven-month grace period. Then he forced most of the urban &quot;dhimmi&quot; population in Morocco, both Jewish and Christian, to convert to Islam. In 1198, the Almohad emir Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur decreed that Jews must wear a dark blue garb, with very large sleeves and a grotesquely oversized hat; his son altered the colour to yellow, a change that may have influenced Catholic ordinances some time later. Those who converted had to wear clothing that identified them as Jews since they were not regarded as sincere Muslims. Cases of mass martyrdom of Jews who refused to convert to Islam are recorded. The treatment and persecution of Christians under Almohad rule was a drastic change as well.

Many of the conversions were superficial. Maimonides urged Jews to choose the superficial conversion over martyrdom and argued, &quot;Muslims know very well that we do not mean what we say, and that what we say is only to escape the ruler&#x27;s punishment and to satisfy him with this simple confession.&quot; Abraham Ibn Ezra (1089–1164), who himself fled the persecutions of the Almohads, composed an elegy mourning the destruction of many Jewish communities throughout Spain and the Maghreb under the Almohads. Many Jews fled from territories ruled by the Almohads to Christian lands, and others, like the family of Maimonides, fled east to more tolerant Muslim lands. However, a few Jewish traders still working in North Africa are recorded.

Idris al-Ma&#x27;mun, a late Almohad pretender (ruled 1229–1232 in parts of Morocco), renounced much Almohad doctrine, including the identification of Ibn Tumart as the Mahdi, and the denial of &quot;dhimmi&quot; status. He allowed Jews to practice their religion openly in Marrakesh and even allowed a Christian church there as part of his alliance with Castile. In Iberia, Almohad rule collapsed in the 1200s and was succeeded by several &quot;Taifa&quot; kingdoms, which allowed Jews to practice their religion openly.

<text>Eucalyptus () is a genus of more than 700 species of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. Most species of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; are trees, often mallees, and a few are shrubs. Along with several other genera in the tribe Eucalypteae, including &quot;Corymbia&quot; and &quot;Angophora&quot;, they are commonly known as eucalypts or &quot;gum trees&quot;. Plants in the genus &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; have bark that is either smooth, fibrous, hard, or stringy and leaves that have oil glands. The sepals and petals are fused to form a &quot;cap&quot; or operculum over the stamens, hence the name from Greek &quot;eû&quot; (&quot;well&quot;) and &quot;kaluptós&quot; (&quot;covered&quot;). The fruit is a woody capsule commonly referred to as a &quot;gumnut&quot;.

Most species of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; are native to Australia, and every state and territory has representative species. About three-quarters of Australian forests are eucalypt forests. Many eucalypt species have adapted to wildfire, are able to resprout after fire, or have seeds that survive fire.

A few species are native to islands north of Australia, and a smaller number are only found outside the continent. Eucalypts have been grown in plantations in many other countries because they are fast-growing, have valuable timber, or can be used for pulpwood, honey production, or essential oils. In some countries, however, they have been removed because of the danger of forest fires due to their high flammability.

==Description==
===Size and habit===
Eucalypts vary in size and habit from shrubs to tall trees. Trees usually have a single main stem or trunk but many eucalypts are mallees that are multistemmed from ground level and rarely taller than . There is no clear distinction between a mallee and a shrub but in eucalypts, a shrub is a mature plant less than tall and growing in an extreme environment. &quot;Eucalyptus vernicosa&quot; in the Tasmanian highlands, &quot;E. yalatensis&quot; on the Nullarbor and &quot;E. surgens&quot; growing on coastal cliffs in Western Australia are examples of eucalypt shrubs.

The terms &quot;mallet&quot; and &quot;marlock&quot; are only applied to Western Australian eucalypts. A mallet is a tree with a single thin trunk with a steeply branching habit but lacks both a lignotuber and epicormic buds. &quot;Eucalyptus astringens&quot; is an example of a mallet. A marlock is a shrub or small tree with a single, short trunk, that lacks a lignotuber and has spreading, densely leafy branches that often reach almost to the ground. &quot;Eucalyptus platypus&quot; is an example of a marlock.

&quot;Eucalyptus&quot; trees, including mallets and marlocks, are single-stemmed and include &quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot;, the tallest known flowering plant on Earth. The tallest reliably measured tree in Europe, &quot;Karri Knight&quot;, can be found in Coimbra, Portugal in Vale de Canas. It is a &quot;Eucalyptus diversicolor&quot; of 72.9 meters height and of 5.71 meters girth.

Tree sizes follow the convention of:
* Small: to in height
* Medium-sized: 
* Tall: 
* Very tall: over 
===Bark===
All eucalypts add a layer of bark every year and the outermost layer dies. In about half of the species, the dead bark is shed exposing a new layer of fresh, living bark. The dead bark may be shed in large slabs, in ribbons or in small flakes. These species are known as &quot;smooth barks&quot; and include &quot;E. sheathiana&quot;, &quot;E. diversicolor&quot;, &quot;E. cosmophylla&quot; and &quot;E. cladocalyx&quot;. The remaining species retain the dead bark which dries out and accumulates. In some of these species, the fibres in the bark are loosely intertwined (in stringybarks such as &quot;E. macrorhyncha&quot; or peppermints such as &quot;E. radiata&quot;) or more tightly adherent (as in the &quot;boxes&quot; such as &quot;E. leptophleba&quot;). In some species (the &quot;ironbarks&quot; such as &quot;E. crebra&quot; and &quot;E. jensenii&quot;) the rough bark is infused with gum resin.

Many species are &#x27;half-barks&#x27; or &#x27;blackbutts&#x27; in which the dead bark is retained in the lower half of the trunks or stems—for example, &quot;E. brachycalyx&quot;, &quot;E. ochrophloia&quot;, and &quot;E. occidentalis&quot;—or only in a thick, black accumulation at the base, as in &quot;E. clelandii&quot;. In some species in this category, for example &quot;E. youngiana&quot; and &quot;E. viminalis&quot;, the rough basal bark is very ribbony at the top, where it gives way to the smooth upper stems. The smooth upper bark of the half-barks and that of the completely smooth-barked trees and mallees can produce remarkable colour and interest, for example &quot;E. deglupta&quot;.

&quot;E. globulus&quot; bark cells are able to photosynthesize in the absence of foliage, conferring an &quot;increased capacity to re-fix internal CO2 following partial defoliation&quot;. This allows the tree to grow in less-than-ideal climates, in addition to providing a better chance of recovery from damage sustained to its leaves in an event such as a fire.

Different commonly recognised types of bark include:
* Stringybark—consists of long fibres and can be pulled off in long pieces. It is usually thick with a spongy texture.
* Ironbark—is hard, rough, and deeply furrowed. It is impregnated with dried kino (a sap exuded by the tree) which gives a dark red or even black colour.
* Tessellated—bark is broken up into many distinct flakes. They are corkish and can flake off.
* Box—has short fibres. Some also show tessellation.
* Ribbon—has the bark coming off in long, thin pieces, but is still loosely attached in some places. They can be long ribbons, firmer strips, or twisted curls.

===Leaves===

Nearly all &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; are evergreen, but some tropical species lose their leaves at the end of the dry season. As in other members of the myrtle family, &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; leaves are covered with oil glands. The copious oils produced are an important feature of the genus. Although mature &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; trees may be towering and fully leafed, their shade is characteristically patchy because the leaves usually hang downwards.

The leaves on a mature &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; plant are commonly lanceolate, petiolate, apparently alternate and waxy or glossy green. In contrast, the leaves of seedlings are often opposite, sessile and glaucous. But many exceptions to this pattern exist. Many species such as &quot;E. melanophloia&quot; and &quot;E. setosa&quot; retain the juvenile leaf form even when the plant is reproductively mature. Some species, such as &quot;E. macrocarpa&quot;, &quot;E. rhodantha&quot;, and &quot;E. crucis&quot;, are sought-after ornamentals due to this lifelong juvenile leaf form. A few species, such as &quot;E. petraea&quot;, &quot;E. dundasii&quot;, and &quot;E. lansdowneana&quot;, have shiny green leaves throughout their life cycle. &quot;Eucalyptus caesia&quot; exhibits the opposite pattern of leaf development to most &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;, with shiny green leaves in the seedling stage and dull, glaucous leaves in mature crowns. The contrast between juvenile and adult leaf phases is valuable in field identification.

Four leaf phases are recognised in the development of a &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; plant: the &#x27;seedling&#x27;, &#x27;juvenile&#x27;, &#x27;intermediate&#x27;, and &#x27;adult&#x27; phases. However, no definite transitional point occurs between the phases. The intermediate phase, when the largest leaves are often formed, links the juvenile and adult phases.

In all except a few species, the leaves form in pairs on opposite sides of a square stem, consecutive pairs being at right angles to each other (decussate). In some narrow-leaved species, for example &quot;E. oleosa&quot;, the seedling leaves after the second leaf pair are often clustered in a detectable spiral arrangement about a five-sided stem. After the spiral phase, which may last from several to many nodes, the arrangement reverts to decussate by the absorption of some of the leaf-bearing faces of the stem. In those species with opposite adult foliage the leaf pairs, which have been formed opposite at the stem apex, become separated at their bases by unequal elongation of the stem to produce the apparently alternate adult leaves.

===Flowers and fruits===

The most readily recognisable characteristics of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; species are the distinctive flowers and fruit (capsules or &quot;gumnuts&quot;). Flowers have numerous fluffy stamens which may be white, cream, yellow, pink, or red; in bud, the stamens are enclosed in a cap known as an operculum which is composed of the fused sepals or petals, or both. Thus, flowers have no petals, but instead decorate themselves with the many showy stamens. As the stamens expand, the operculum is forced off, splitting away from the cup-like base of the flower; this is one of the features that unites the genus. The woody fruits or capsules are roughly cone-shaped and have valves at the end which open to release the seeds, which are waxy, rod-shaped, about 1 mm in length, and yellow-brown in colour. Most species do not flower until adult foliage starts to appear; &quot;E. cinerea&quot; and &quot;E. perriniana&quot; are notable exceptions.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; was first formally described in 1789 by Charles Louis L&#x27;Héritier de Brutelle who published the description in his book &quot;Sertum Anglicum, seu, Plantae rariores quae in hortis juxta Londinum&quot; along with a description of the type species, &quot;Eucalyptus obliqua&quot;. The name &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek words &quot;eu&quot; meaning &#x27;well&#x27; and &quot;calyptos&quot; &#x27;covered&#x27;, referring to the operculum covering the flower buds.

The type specimen was collected in 1777 by David Nelson, the gardener-botanist on Cook&#x27;s third voyage. He collected the specimen on Bruny Island and sent it to de Brutelle who was working in London at that time.

==History==
Although eucalypts must have been seen by the very early European explorers and collectors, no botanical collections of them are known to have been made until 1770 when Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander arrived at Botany Bay with Captain James Cook. There they collected specimens of &quot;E. gummifera&quot; and later, near the Endeavour River in northern &quot;Queensland&quot;, &quot;E. platyphylla&quot;; neither of these species was named as such at the time.

In 1777, on Cook&#x27;s third expedition, David Nelson collected a eucalypt on Bruny Island in southern Tasmania. This specimen was taken to the British Museum in London, and was named &quot;Eucalyptus obliqua&quot; by the French botanist L&#x27;Héritier, who was working in London at the time. He coined the generic name from the Greek roots &quot;eu&quot; and &quot;calyptos&quot;, meaning &quot;well&quot; and &quot;covered&quot; in reference to the operculum of the flower bud which protects the developing flower parts as the flower develops and is shed by the pressure of the emerging stamens at flowering.

The name &quot;obliqua&quot; was derived from the Latin &quot;obliquus&quot;, meaning &quot;oblique&quot;, which is the botanical term describing a leaf base where the two sides of the leaf blade are of unequal length and do not meet the petiole at the same place.

&quot;E. obliqua&quot; was published in 1788–89, which coincided with the European colonisation of Australia. Between then and the turn of the 19th century, several more species of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; were named and published. Most of these were by the English botanist James Edward Smith and most were, as might be expected, trees of the Sydney region. These include the economically valuable &quot;E. pilularis&quot;, &quot;E. saligna&quot; and &quot;E. tereticornis&quot;.

The first endemic Western Australian &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; to be collected and subsequently named was the Yate (&quot;E. cornuta&quot;) by the French botanist Jacques Labillardière, who collected in what is now the Esperance area in 1792.

Several Australian botanists were active during the 19th century, particularly Ferdinand von Mueller, whose work on &quot;eucalypts&quot; contributed greatly to the first comprehensive account of the genus in George Bentham&#x27;s &quot;Flora Australiensis&quot; in 1867. The account is the most important early systematic treatment of the genus. Bentham divided it into five series whose distinctions were based on characteristics of the stamens, particularly the anthers (Mueller, 1879–84), work elaborated by Joseph Henry Maiden (1903–33) and still further by William Faris Blakely (1934). The anther system became too complex to be workable and more recent systematic work has concentrated on the characteristics of buds, fruits, leaves and bark.

===Species and hybrids===

Over 700 species of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; are known. Some have diverged from the mainstream of the genus to the extent that they are quite isolated genetically and are able to be recognised by only a few relatively invariant characteristics. Most, however, may be regarded as belonging to large or small groups of related species, which are often in geographical contact with each other and between which gene exchange still occurs. In these situations, many species appear to grade into one another, and intermediate forms are common. In other words, some species are relatively fixed genetically, as expressed in their morphology, while others have not diverged completely from their nearest relatives.

Hybrid individuals have not always been recognised as such on first collection and some have been named as new species, such as &quot;E. chrysantha&quot; (&quot;E. preissiana&quot; × &quot;E. sepulcralis&quot;) and &quot;E.&quot; &quot;rivalis&quot; (&quot;E. marginata&quot; × &quot;E. megacarpa&quot;). Hybrid combinations are not particularly common in the field, but some other published species frequently seen in Australia have been suggested to be hybrid combinations. For example, &quot;Eucalyptus × erythrandra&quot; is believed to be &quot;E. angulosa&quot; × &quot;E. teraptera&quot; and due to its wide distribution is often referred to in texts.

Renantherin, a phenolic compound present in the leaves of some &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; species, allows chemotaxonomic discrimination in the sections renantheroideae and renantherae and the ratio of the amount of leucoanthocyanins varies considerably in certain species.

===Related genera===

&quot;Eucalyptus&quot; is one of three similar genera that are commonly referred to as &quot;eucalypts&quot;, the others being &quot;Corymbia&quot; and &quot;Angophora&quot;. Many species, though by no means all, are known as gum trees because they exude copious kino from any break in the bark (e.g., scribbly gum). The generic name is derived from the Greek words ευ (&quot;eu&quot;) &quot;well&quot; and καλύπτω (&quot;kalýpto&quot;) &quot;to cover&quot;, referring to the operculum on the calyx that initially conceals the flower.

==Distribution==
According to Plants of the World Online, there are more 715 species of plants in the genus &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; and most are native to Australia; a very small number are found in adjacent areas of New Guinea and Indonesia. One species, &quot;Eucalyptus deglupta,&quot; ranges as far north as the Philippines. Of the 15 species found outside Australia, just nine are exclusively non-Australian. Species of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; are cultivated widely in the tropical and temperate world, including the Americas, Europe, Africa, the Mediterranean Basin, the Middle East, China, and the Indian subcontinent. However, the range over which many eucalypts can be planted in the temperate zone is constrained by their limited cold tolerance.

Australia is covered by of eucalypt forest, comprising three quarters of the area covered by native forest. The Blue Mountains of southeastern Australia have been a centre of eucalypt diversification; their name is in reference to the blue haze prevalent in the area, believed derived from the volatile terpenoids emitted by these trees.

==Fossil record==
The oldest definitive &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; fossils are from Patagonia in South America, where eucalypts are no longer native, though they have been introduced from Australia. The fossils are from the early Eocene (51.9 Mya), and were found in the Laguna del Hunco Formation in Chubut Province in Argentina. This shows that the genus had a Gondwanan distribution. Fossil leaves also occur in the Miocene of New Zealand, where the genus is not native today, but again have been introduced from Australia.

Despite the prominence of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; in modern Australia, estimated to contribute some 75% of the modern vegetation, the fossil record is very scarce throughout much of the Cenozoic, and suggests that this rise to dominance is a geologically more recent phenomenon. The oldest reliably dated macrofossil of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; is a 21-million-year-old tree-stump encased in basalt in the upper Lachlan Valley in New South Wales. Other fossils have been found, but many are either unreliably dated or else unreliably identified.

It is useful to consider where &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; fossils have not been found. Extensive research has gone into the fossil floras of the Paleocene to Oligocene of South-Eastern Australia, and has failed to uncover a single &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; specimen. Although the evidence is sparse, the best hypothesis is that in the mid-Tertiary, the continental margins of Australia only supported more mesic noneucalypt vegetation, and that eucalypts probably contributed to the drier vegetation of the arid continental interior. With the progressive drying out of the continent since the Miocene, eucalypts were displaced to the continental margins, and much of the mesic and rainforest vegetation that was once there was eliminated.

The current superdominance of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; in Australia may be an artefact of human influence on its ecology. In more recent sediments, numerous findings of a dramatic increase in the abundance of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; pollen are associated with increased charcoal levels. Though this occurs at different rates throughout Australia, it is compelling evidence for a relationship between the artificial increase of fire frequency with the arrival of Aboriginals and increased prevalence of this exceptionally fire-tolerant genus.

==Tall timber==
Several eucalypt species are among the tallest trees in the world. &quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot;, the Australian &#x27;mountain ash&#x27;, is the tallest of all flowering plants (angiosperms); today, the tallest measured specimen named Centurion is tall. Coast Douglas-fir is about the same height; only coast redwood is taller, and they are conifers (gymnosperms). Six other eucalypt species exceed 80 metres in height: &quot;Eucalyptus obliqua&quot;, &quot;Eucalyptus delegatensis&quot;, &quot;Eucalyptus diversicolor&quot;, &quot;Eucalyptus nitens&quot;, &quot;Eucalyptus globulus&quot; and &quot;Eucalyptus viminalis&quot;.

==Frost intolerance==
Most eucalypts are not tolerant of severe cold. Eucalypts do well in a range of climates but are usually damaged by anything beyond a light frost of ; the hardiest are the snow gums, such as &quot;Eucalyptus pauciflora&quot;, which is capable of withstanding cold and frost down to about . Two subspecies, &quot;E. pauciflora subsp. niphophila&quot; and &quot;E. pauciflora subsp. debeuzevillei&quot; in particular are even hardier and can tolerate even quite severe winters. Several other species, especially from the high plateau and mountains of central Tasmania such as &quot;Eucalyptus coccifera&quot;, &quot;Eucalyptus subcrenulata&quot; and &quot;Eucalyptus gunnii&quot;, have also produced extreme cold-hardy forms and it is seed procured from these genetically hardy strains that are planted for ornament in colder parts of the world.

==Animal relationships==
An essential oil extracted from &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; leaves contains compounds that are powerful natural disinfectants and can be toxic in large quantities. Several marsupial herbivores, notably koalas and some possums, are relatively tolerant of it. The close correlation of these oils with other more potent toxins called formylated phloroglucinol compounds (euglobals, macrocarpals and sideroxylonals) allows koalas and other marsupial species to make food choices based on the smell of the leaves. For koalas, these compounds are the most important factor in leaf choice.

A wide variety of insects also feed exclusively on &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; leaves, such as beetles in the genus &quot;Paropsisterna&quot;.

The eusocial beetle &quot;Austroplatypus incompertus&quot; makes and defends its galleries exclusively inside eucalypts, including some species of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; and &quot;Corymbia&quot;.

==Diseases on plants==
Fungal species &quot;Mycosphaerella&quot; and &quot;Teratosphaeria&quot; have been associated with leaf disease on various &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; species.
 Several fungal species from Teratosphaeriaceae family are causal agents in leaf diseases and stem cankers of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; in Uruguay, and Australia.

==Adaptation to fire==


Eucalypts originated between 35 and 50 million years ago, not long after Australia-New Guinea separated from Gondwana, their rise coinciding with an increase in fossil charcoal deposits (suggesting that fire was a factor even then), but they remained a minor component of the Tertiary rainforest until about 20 million years ago, when the gradual drying of the continent and depletion of soil nutrients led to the development of a more open forest type, predominantly &quot;Casuarina&quot; and &quot;Acacia&quot; species.

The two valuable timber trees, alpine ash &quot;E. delegatensis&quot; and Australian mountain ash &quot;E. regnans&quot;, are killed by fire and only regenerate from seed. The same 2003 bushfire that had little impact on forests around Canberra resulted in thousands of hectares of dead ash forests. However, a small amount of ash survived and put out new ash trees as well.

===Fire hazard===

&quot;Eucalyptus&quot; oil is highly flammable and at high enough temperatures the oil expands quickening the spread of wildfires. Bushfires can travel easily through the oil-rich air of the tree crowns. Eucalypts obtain long-term fire survivability from their ability to regenerate from epicormic buds situated deep within their thick bark, or from lignotubers, or by producing serotinous fruits.

In seasonally dry climates oaks are often fire-resistant, particularly in open grasslands, as a grass fire is insufficient to ignite the scattered trees. In contrast, a &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; forest tends to promote fire because of the volatile and highly combustible oils produced by the leaves, as well as the production of large amounts of litter high in phenolics, preventing its breakdown by fungi and thus accumulating as large amounts of dry, combustible fuel. Consequently, dense eucalypt plantings may be subject to catastrophic firestorms. In fact, almost thirty years before the Oakland firestorm of 1991, a study of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; in the area warned that the litter beneath the trees builds up very rapidly and should be regularly monitored and removed. It has been estimated that 70% of the energy released through the combustion of vegetation in the Oakland fire was due to &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;. In a National Park Service study, it was found that the fuel load (in tons per acre) of non-native &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; woods is almost three times as great as native oak woodland.

During World War II, one California town cut down their &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; trees to &quot;about a third of their height in the vicinity of anti-aircraft guns&quot; because of the known fire-fueling qualities of the trees, with the mayor telling a newspaper reporter, &quot;If a shell so much as hits a leaf, it&#x27;s supposed to explode.&quot;

==Falling branches==

Some species of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; drop branches unexpectedly. In Australia, Parks Victoria warns campers not to camp under river red gums. Some councils in Australia such as Gosnells, Western Australia, have removed eucalypts after reports of damage from dropped branches, even in the face of lengthy, well publicised protests to protect particular trees. A former Australian National Botanic Gardens director and consulting arborist, Robert Boden, has been quoted referring to &quot;summer branch drop&quot;. Dropping of branches is recognised in Australia literature through the fictional death of Judy in &quot;Seven Little Australians&quot;. Although all large trees can drop branches, the density of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; wood is high due to its high resin content, increasing the hazard.

==Cultivation and uses==

Eucalypts were introduced from Australia to the rest of the world following the Cook expedition in 1770. Collected by Sir Joseph Banks, botanist on the expedition, they were subsequently introduced to many parts of the world, notably California, southern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, South Asia and South America. About 250 species are under cultivation in California. In Portugal and also Spain, eucalypts have been grown in plantations for the production of pulpwood. &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; are the basis for several industries, such as sawmilling, pulp, charcoal and others. Several species have become invasive and are causing major problems for local ecosystems, mainly due to the absence of wildlife corridors and rotations management.

Eucalypts have many uses which have made them economically important trees, and they have become a cash crop in poor areas such as Timbuktu, Mali and the Peruvian Andes, despite concerns that the trees are invasive in some environments like those of South Africa. Best-known are perhaps the varieties karri and yellow box. Due to their fast growth, the foremost benefit of these trees is their wood. They can be chopped off at the root and grow back again. They provide many desirable characteristics for use as ornament, timber, firewood and pulpwood. Eucalyptus wood is also used in a number of industries, from fence posts (where the oil-rich wood&#x27;s high resistance to decay is valued) and charcoal to cellulose extraction for biofuels. Fast growth also makes eucalypts suitable as windbreaks and to reduce erosion.

Some &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; species have attracted attention from horticulturists, global development researchers, and environmentalists because of desirable traits such as being fast-growing sources of wood, producing oil that can be used for cleaning and as a natural insecticide, or an ability to be used to drain swamps and thereby reduce the risk of malaria. Eucalyptus oil finds many uses like in fuels, fragrances, insect repellence and antimicrobial activity. &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; trees show allelopathic effects; they release compounds which inhibit other plant species from growing nearby. Outside their natural ranges, eucalypts are both lauded for their beneficial economic impact on poor populations and criticised for being &quot;water-guzzling&quot; aliens, leading to controversy over their total impact.

Eucalypts draw a tremendous amount of water from the soil through the process of transpiration. They have been planted (or re-planted) in some places to lower the water table and reduce soil salination. Eucalypts have also been used as a way of reducing malaria by draining the soil in Algeria, Lebanon, Sicily, elsewhere in Europe, in the Caucasus (Western Georgia), and California. Drainage removes swamps which provide a habitat for mosquito larvae, but can also destroy ecologically productive areas. This drainage is not limited to the soil surface, because the &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; roots are up to in length and can, depending on the location, even reach the phreatic zone.

===Pulpwood===

&quot;Eucalyptus&quot; is the most common short fibre source for pulpwood to make pulp. The types most often used in papermaking are &quot;Eucalyptus globulus&quot; (in temperate areas) and the &quot;Eucalyptus urophylla&quot; x &quot;Eucalyptus grandis&quot; hybrid (in the tropics). The fibre length of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; is relatively short and uniform with low coarseness compared with other hardwoods commonly used as pulpwood. The fibres are slender, yet relatively thick walled. This gives uniform paper formation and high opacity that are important for all types of fine papers. The low coarseness is important for high quality coated papers. &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; is suitable for many tissue papers as the short and slender fibres gives a high number of fibres per gram and low coarseness contributes to softness.

===&quot;Eucalyptus&quot; oil===

Eucalyptus oil is readily steam distilled from the leaves and can be used for cleaning and as an industrial solvent, as an antiseptic, for deodorising, and in very small quantities in food supplements, especially sweets, cough drops, toothpaste and decongestants. It has insect-repellent properties, and serves as an active ingredient in some commercial mosquito-repellents. Aromatherapists have adopted &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; oils for a wide range of purposes. &quot;Eucalyptus globulus&quot; is the principal source of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; oil worldwide.

===Musical instruments===
Eucalypt wood is also commonly used to make didgeridoos, a traditional Australian Aboriginal wind instrument. The trunk of the tree is hollowed out by termites, and then cut down if the bore is of the correct size and shape.

Eucalypt wood is also being used as a tonewood and a fingerboard material for acoustic guitars, notably by the California-based Taylor company.

===Dyes===
All parts of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; may be used to make dyes that are substantive on protein fibres (such as silk and wool), simply by processing the plant part with water. Colours to be achieved range from yellow and orange through green, tan, chocolate and deep rust red.

===Prospecting===
&quot;Eucalyptus&quot; trees in the Australian outback draw up gold from tens of metres underground through their root system and deposit it as particles in their leaves and branches. A Maia detector for x-ray elemental imaging at the Australian Synchrotron clearly showed deposits of gold and other metals in the structure of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; leaves from the Kalgoorlie region of Western Australia that would have been untraceable using other methods. The microscopic leaf-bound &quot;nuggets&quot;, about 8 micrometres wide on average, are not worth collecting themselves, but may provide an environmentally benign way of locating subsurface mineral deposits.

==&quot;Eucalyptus&quot; as plantation species==

In the 20th century, scientists around the world experimented with &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; species. They hoped to grow them in the tropics, but most experimental results failed until breakthroughs in the 1960s-1980s in species selection, silviculture, and breeding programs &quot;unlocked&quot; the potential of eucalypts in the tropics. Prior to then, as Brett Bennett noted in a 2010 article, eucalypts were something of the &quot;El Dorado&quot; of forestry. Today, &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; is the most widely planted type of tree in plantations around the world, in South America (mainly in Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay), South Africa, Australia, India, Galicia, Portugal and many more.

===North America===
;California
In the 1850s, &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; trees were introduced to California by Australians during the California Gold Rush. Much of California is similar in climate to parts of Australia. By the early 1900s, thousands of acres of eucalypts were planted with the encouragement of the state government. It was hoped that they would provide a renewable source of timber for construction, furniture making and railway sleepers. It was soon found that for the latter purpose &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; was particularly unsuitable, as the ties made from &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; had a tendency to twist while drying, and the dried ties were so tough that it was nearly impossible to hammer rail spikes into them.

They went on to note that the promise of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; in California was based on the old virgin forests of Australia. This was a mistake, as the young trees being harvested in California could not compare in quality to the centuries-old &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; timber of Australia. It reacted differently to harvest. The older trees didn&#x27;t split or warp as the infant California crop did. There was a vast difference between the two, and this would doom the California &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; industry.
The species &quot;E. camaldulensis, E. tereticornis,&quot; and &quot;E. cladocalyx&quot; are all present in California, but the blue gum &quot;E. globulus&quot; makes up by far the largest population in the state. One way in which the &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;, mainly the blue gum &quot;E. globulus&quot;, proved valuable in California was in providing windbreaks for highways, orange groves, and farms in the mostly treeless central part of the state. They are also admired as shade and ornamental trees in many cities and gardens.

&quot;Eucalyptus&quot; plantations in California have been criticised, because they compete with native plants and typically do not support native animals. &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; has historically been planted to replace California&#x27;s coast live oak population, and the new &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; is not as hospitable to native flora and fauna as the oaks. In appropriately foggy conditions on the California Coast, &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; can spread at a rapid rate. The absence of natural inhibitors such as the koala or pathogens native to Australia have aided in the spread of California &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; trees. This is not as big of an issue further inland, but on the coast invasive eucalypts can disrupt native ecosystems. &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; may have adverse effects on local streams due to their chemical composition, and their dominance threatens species that rely on native trees. Nevertheless, some native species have been known to adapt to the &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; trees. Notable examples are herons, great horned owl, and the monarch butterfly using &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; groves as habitat. Despite these successes, eucalypts generally has a net negative impact on the overall balance of the native ecosystem.

A heavy concern regarding Eucalypts in California is their status as a fire hazard. &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; trees were a catalyst for the spread of the 1923 fire in Berkeley, which destroyed 568 homes. The 1991 Oakland Hills firestorm, which caused US$1.5 billion in damage, destroyed almost 3,000 homes, and killed 25 people, was partly fueled by large numbers of eucalypts close to the houses.

Despite these issues, there are calls to preserve the &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; plants in California. Advocates for the tree claim its fire risk has been overstated. Some even claim that the &quot;Eucalyptus&#x27;s&quot; absorption of moisture makes it a barrier against fire. These experts believe that the herbicides used to remove the &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; would negatively impact the ecosystem, and the loss of the trees would release carbon into the atmosphere unnecessarily. There is also an aesthetic argument for keeping the &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;; the trees are viewed by many as an attractive and iconic part of the California landscape. Many say that although the tree is not native, it has been in California long enough to become an essential part of the ecosystem and therefore should not be attacked as invasive. These arguments have caused experts and citizens in California, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area, to debate the merits of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; removal versus preservation. However, the general consensus remains that some areas urgently require &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; management to stave off potential fire hazards.

Efforts to remove some of California&#x27;s &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; trees have been met with a mixed reaction from the public, and there have been protests against removal. Removing &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; trees can be expensive and often requires machinery or the use of herbicides. The trees struggle to reproduce on their own outside of the foggy regions of Coastal California, and therefore some inland &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; forests are predicted to die out naturally. In some parts of California, eucalypt plantations are being removed and native trees and plants restored. Individuals have also illegally destroyed some trees and are suspected of introducing insect pests from Australia which attack the trees.

Certain &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; species may also be grown for ornament in warmer parts of the Pacific Northwest—western Washington, western Oregon and southwestern British Columbia.

===South America===
;Argentina
It was introduced in Argentina around 1870 by President Domingo F. Sarmiento, who had brought the seeds from Australia and it quickly became very popular. The most widely planted species were &quot;E. globulus&quot;, &quot;E. viminalis&quot; and &quot;E. rostrata&quot;. Currently, the Humid Pampas region has small forests and &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; barriers, some up to 80 years old, about 50 meters high and a maximum of one meter in diameter.

;Uruguay
Antonio Lussich introduced &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; into Uruguay in approximately 1896, throughout what is now Maldonado Department, and it has spread all over the south-eastern and eastern coast. There had been no trees in the area because it consisted of dry sand dunes and stones. Lussich also introduced many other trees, particularly &quot;Acacia&quot; and pines, but they have not expanded so extensively.

Uruguayan forestry crops using &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; species have been promoted since 1989, when the new National Forestry Law established that 20% of the national territory would be dedicated to forestry. As the main landscape of Uruguay is grassland (140,000 km2, 87% of the national territory), most of the forestry plantations would be established in prairie regions.
The planting of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; sp. has been criticised because of concerns that soil would be degraded by nutrient depletion and other biological changes. During the last ten years, in the northwestern regions of Uruguay the &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; sp. plantations have reached annual forestation rates of 300%. That zone has a potential forested area of 1 million hectares, approximately 29% of the national territory dedicated to forestry, of which approximately 800,000 hectares are currently forested by monoculture of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; spp. It is expected that the radical and durable substitution of vegetation cover leads to changes in the quantity and quality of soil organic matter. Such changes may also influence soil fertility and soil physical and chemical properties. The soil quality effects associated with &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; sp. plantations could have adverse effects on soil chemistry; for example: soil acidification, iron leaching, allelopathic activities and a high C:N ratio of litter. Additionally, as most scientific understanding of land cover change effects is related to ecosystems where forests were replaced by grasslands or crops, or grassland was replaced by crops, the environmental effects of the current Uruguayan land cover changes are not well understood. The first scientific publication on soil studies in western zone tree plantations (focused on pulp production) appeared in 2004 and described soil acidification and soil carbon changes, similar to a podzolisation process, and destruction of clay (illite-like minerals), which is the main reservoir of potassium in the soil. Although these studies were carried out in an important zone for forest cultivation, they cannot define the current situation in the rest of the land area under eucalyptus cultivation. Moreover, recently Jackson and Jobbagy have proposed another adverse environmental impact that may result from &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; culture on prairie soils—stream acidification.

The &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; species most planted are &quot;E. grandis&quot;, &quot;E. globulus&quot; and &quot;E. dunnii&quot;; they are used mainly for pulp mills. Approximately 80,000 ha of &quot;E. grandis&quot; situated in the departments of Rivera, Tacuarembó and Paysandú is primarily earmarked for the solid wood market, although a portion of it is used for sawlogs and plywood. The current area under commercial forest plantation is 6% of the total. The main uses of the wood produced are elemental chlorine free pulp mill production (for cellulose and paper), sawlogs, plywood and bioenergy (thermoelectric generation). Most of the products obtained from sawmills and pulp mills, as well as plywood and logs, are exported. This has raised the income of this sector with respect to traditional products from other sectors. Uruguayan forestry plantations have rates of growth of 30 cubic metres per hectare per year and commercial harvesting occurs after nine years.

;Brazil

Eucalypts were introduced to Brazil in 1910, for timber substitution and the charcoal industry. It has thrived in the local environment, and today there are around 7 million hectares planted. The wood is highly valued by the charcoal and pulp and paper industries. The short rotation allows a larger wood production and supplies wood for several other activities, helping to preserve the native forests from logging. When well managed, the plantation soils can sustain endless replanting. &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; plantings are also used as wind breaks. Brazil&#x27;s plantations have world-record rates of growth, typically over 40 cubic metres per hectare per year, and commercial harvesting occurs after years 5. Due to continual development and governmental funding, year-on-year growth is consistently being improved. &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; can produce up to 100 cubic metres per hectare per year. Brazil has become the top exporter and producer of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; round wood and pulp, and has played an important role in developing the Australian market through the country&#x27;s committed research in this area. The local iron producers in Brazil rely heavily on sustainably grown &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; for charcoal; this has greatly pushed up the price of charcoal in recent years. The plantations are generally owned and operated for national and international industry by timber asset companies such as Thomson Forestry, Greenwood Management or cellulose producers such as Aracruz Cellulose and Stora Enso.

Overall, South America was expected to produce 55% of the world&#x27;s &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; round-wood by 2010. Many environmental NGOs have criticised the use of exotic tree species for forestry in Latin America.

===Africa===
;Angola
In the East of Angola, the Benguela railway company created eucalyptus plantations for firing its steam locomotives.

;Ethiopia
Eucalypts were introduced to Ethiopia in either 1894 or 1895, either by Emperor Menelik II&#x27;s French advisor Mondon-Vidailhet or by the Englishman Captain O&#x27;Brian. Menelik II endorsed its planting around his new capital city of Addis Ababa because of the massive deforestation around the city for firewood. According to Richard R.K. Pankhurst, &quot;The great advantage of the eucalypts was that they were fast growing, required little attention and when cut down grew up again from the roots; it could be harvested every ten years. The tree proved successful from the onset&quot;. Plantations of eucalypts spread from the capital to other growing urban centres such as Debre Marqos. Pankhurst reports that the most common species found in Addis Ababa in the mid-1960s was &quot;E. globulus&quot;, although he also found &quot;E. melliodora&quot; and &quot;E. rostrata&quot; in significant numbers. David Buxton, writing of central Ethiopia in the mid-1940s, observed that eucalyptus trees &quot;have become an integral -- and a pleasing -- element in the Shoan landscape and has largely displaced the slow-growing native &#x27;cedar&#x27; (&quot;Juniperus procera&quot;).&quot;

It was commonly believed that the thirst of the &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; &quot;tended to dry up rivers and wells&quot;, creating such opposition to the species that in 1913 a proclamation was issued ordering a partial destruction of all standing trees, and their replacement with mulberry trees. Pankhurst reports, &quot;The proclamation however remained a dead letter; there is no evidence of eucalypts being uprooted, still less of mulberry trees being planted.&quot; Eucalypts remain a defining feature of Addis Ababa.

;Madagascar
Much of Madagascar&#x27;s original native forest has been replaced with &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;, threatening biodiversity by isolating remaining natural areas such as Andasibe-Mantadia National Park.

;South Africa
Numerous &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; species have been introduced into South Africa, mainly for timber and firewood but also for ornamental purposes. They are popular with beekeepers for the honey they provide. However, in South Africa they are considered invasive, with their water-sucking capabilities threatening water supplies. They also release a chemical into the surrounding soil which kills native competitors.

&quot;Eucalyptus&quot; seedlings are usually unable to compete with the indigenous grasses, but after a fire when the grass cover has been removed, a seed-bed may be created. The following &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; species have been able to become naturalised in South Africa: &quot;E. camaldulensis&quot;, &quot;E. cladocalyx&quot;, &quot;E. diversicolor&quot;, &quot;E. grandis&quot; and &quot;E. lehmannii&quot;.

;Zimbabwe
As in South Africa, many &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; species have been introduced into Zimbabwe, mainly for timber and firewood, and &quot;E. robusta&quot; and &quot;E. tereticornis&quot; have been recorded as having become naturalised there.

===Europe===
====Portugal====
Eucalypts have been grown in Portugal since the mid 19th century, the first thought to be a specimen of &quot;E. obliqua&quot; introduced to Vila Nova de Gaia in 1829. First as an ornamental but soon after in plantations, these eucalypts are prized due to their long and upright trunks, rapid growth and the ability to regrow after cutting. These plantations now occupy around 800,000 hectares, 10% of the country&#x27;s total land area, 90% of the trees being &quot;E. globulus&quot;. As of the late 20th century, there were an estimated 120 species of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; in Portugal. The genus has also been subject to various controversies. Despite representing a large part of the agricultural economy, eucalypt plantations have a negative impact on soil destruction, inducing resistance to water infiltration and increasing the risks of erosion and soil loss, they are highly flammable, aggravating the risk for wildfires. Various Portuguese laws on eucalypt plantations have been formed and reformed to better suit both sides.

There are various &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; species of public interest in Portugal, namely a Karri in Coimbra&#x27;s Mata Nacional de Vale de Canas, considered to be Europe&#x27;s tallest tree at high.

====Italy====
In Italy, the &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; only arrived at the turn of the 19th century and large scale plantations were started at the beginning of the 20th century with the aim of drying up swampy ground to defeat malaria. During the 1930s, Benito Mussolini had thousands of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; planted in the marshes around Rome. This, their rapid growth in the Italian climate and excellent function as windbreaks, has made them a common sight in the south of the country, including the islands of Sardinia and Sicily. They are also valued for the characteristic smelling and tasting honey that is produced from them. The variety of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; most commonly found in Italy is &quot;E. camaldulensis&quot;.

====Greece====
In Greece, eucalypts are widely found, especially in southern Greece and Crete. They are cultivated and used for various purposes, including as an ingredient in pharmaceutical products (e.g., creams, elixirs and sprays) and for leather production. They were imported in 1862 by botanist Theodoros Georgios Orphanides. The principal species is &quot;E. globulus&quot;.

====Ireland====
&quot;Eucalyptus&quot; has been grown in Ireland since trials in the 1930s and now grows wild in South Western Ireland in the mild climate.

===Asia===
&quot;Eucalyptus&quot; seeds of the species &quot;E. globulus&quot; were imported into Palestine in the 1860s, but did not acclimatise well. Later, &quot;E. camaldulensis&quot; was introduced more successfully and it is still a very common tree in Israel. The use of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; trees to drain swampy land was a common practice in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The German Templer colony of Sarona had begun planting &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; for this purpose by 1874, though it is not known where the seeds came from. Many Zionist colonies also adopted the practice in the following years under the guidance of the Mikveh Israel Agricultural School. &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; trees are now considered an invasive species in the region.

In India, the Institute of Forest Genetics and Tree Breeding, Coimbatore started a &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; breeding program in the 1990s. The organisation released four varieties of conventionally bred, high yielding and genetically improved clones for commercial and research interests in 2010.

&quot;Eucalyptus&quot; trees were introduced to Sri Lanka in the late 19th century by tea and coffee planters, for wind protection, shade and fuel. Forestry replanting of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; began in the 1930s in deforested mountain areas, and currently there are about 10 species present in the island. They account for 20% of major reforestation plantings. They provide railway sleepers, utility poles, sawn timber and fuelwood, but are controversial because of their adverse effect on biodiversity, hydrology and soil fertility. They are associated with another invasive species, the eucalyptus gall wasp, &quot;Leptocybe invasa&quot;.

===Pacific Islands===
In Hawaii, some 90 species of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; have been introduced to the islands, where they have displaced some native species due to their higher maximum height, fast growth and lower water needs. Particularly noticeable is the rainbow eucalyptus (&quot;Eucalyptus deglupta&quot;), native to Indonesia and the Philippines, whose bark falls off to reveal a trunk that can be green, red, orange, yellow, pink and purple.

==Non-native &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; and biodiversity==
Due to similar favourable climatic conditions, &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; plantations have often replaced oak woodlands, for example in California, Spain and Portugal. The resulting monocultures have raised concerns about loss of biological diversity, through loss of acorns that mammals and birds feed on, absence of hollows that in oak trees provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and small mammals and for bee colonies, as well as lack of downed trees in managed plantations. A study of the relationship between birds and &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; in the San Francisco Bay Area found that bird diversity was similar in native forest versus &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; forest, but the species were different. One way in which the avifauna (local assortment of bird species) changes is that cavity-nesting birds including woodpeckers, owls, chickadees, wood ducks, etc. are depauperate in &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; groves because the decay-resistant wood of these trees prevents cavity formation by decay or excavation. Also, those bird species that glean insects from foliage, such as warblers and vireos, experience population declines when &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; groves replace oak forest.

Birds that thrive in &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; groves in California tend to prefer tall vertical habitat. These avian species include herons and egrets, which also nest in redwoods. The Point Reyes Bird Observatory observes that sometimes short-billed birds like the ruby-crowned kinglet are found dead beneath &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; trees with their nostrils clogged with pitch.

Monarch butterflies use &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; in California for overwintering, but in some locations have a preference for Monterey pines.

=== &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; as an invasive species ===
&quot;Eucalyptus&quot; trees are considered invasive to local ecosystems and negatively impact water resources in countries where they are introduced.

South Africa

In South Africa, &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; tree species &quot;E. camaldulensis&quot;, &quot;E. cladocalyx&quot;, &quot;E.&quot; &quot;conferruminata,&quot; &quot;E. diversicolor&quot;, &quot;E. grandis&quot; and &quot;E. tereticornis&quot; are listed as Category 1b invaders in the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act. This means most activities with regards to the species are prohibited (such as importing, propagating, translocating or trading) and it should be ensured that it does not spread beyond a plantation&#x27;s domain.

&quot;E. cladocalyx&quot; and &quot;E. diversicolor&quot; are considered Fynbos invaders, and use up to 20% more water than the native fynbos vegetation; with invasive species including &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; being cleared that reduce Cape Town&#x27;s water resource by 55 billion litres or two months worth of water supply.

<text>The areca nut ( or ) or betel nut is the fruit of the areca palm (&quot;Areca catechu&quot;). The palm is originally native to the Philippines, but was carried widely through the tropics by the Austronesian migrations and trade since at least 1500 BCE due to its use in betel nut chewing. It is widespread in cultivation and is considered naturalized in much of the tropical Pacific (Melanesia and Micronesia), South Asia, Southeast Asia, and parts of east Africa. It is not to be confused with betel (&quot;Piper betle&quot;) leaves that are often used to wrap it. The practice of betel nut chewing, often together with other herbs as a stimulant drug, dates back thousands of years, and continues to the present day in many countries.

Betel nut chewing is addictive due to the presence of the stimulant arecoline, and causes adverse health effects, mainly oral and esophageal cancers, and cardiovascular disease. When chewed with additional tobacco in its preparation (like in gutka), there is an even higher risk, especially for oral and oropharyngeal cancers. With tobacco it also raises the risk of fatal coronary artery disease, fatal stroke, and adverse reproductive effects including stillbirth, premature birth, and low birth weight.

Consumption by hundreds of millions of people worldwide—mainly of South/Southeast Asian origins—has been described as a public health emergency.

==Etymology==

The term &quot;areca&quot; originated from Dravidian languages, cognates of which are:
* 
The terms dates back to the 16th century when Dutch and Portuguese sailors took the nut from India to Europe.

== Description ==

The areca nut is not a true nut, but rather the seed of a fruit categorized as a berry. It is commercially available in dried, cured, and fresh forms. When the husk of the fresh fruit is green, the nut inside is soft enough to be cut with a typical knife. In the ripe fruit, the husk becomes yellow or orange, and as it dries, the fruit inside hardens to a wood-like consistency. At that stage, the areca nut can only be sliced using a special scissors-like cutter.

Usually for chewing, a few slices of the nut are wrapped in a betel leaf along with calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) and may include clove, cardamom, catechu resin (&quot;kattha&quot;), or other spices for extra flavouring. Betel leaf has a fresh, peppery taste, but it can also be bitter to varying degrees depending on the variety.

Areca nuts are chewed for their effects as a mild stimulant, causing a warming sensation in the body and slightly heightened alertness, although the effects vary from person to person.

The first nut cultivation in the world was done in Kyasanuru Seeme area of Shimoga district in Karnataka state of India. Even today the cultivators plant the same variety here. Kyasanuru variety gives high yield. Grows wildly in all regions.

In parts of India, Sri Lanka, and southern China, areca nuts are not only chewed along with betel leaf, but are also used in the preparation of Ayurvedic and traditional Chinese medicines. Powdered areca nut is used as a constituent in some dentifrices. Other traditional uses include the removal of tapeworms and other intestinal parasites by swallowing a few teaspoons of powdered areca nut, drunk as a decoction, or by taking tablets containing the extracted alkaloids. According to traditional Ayurvedic medicine, chewing areca nut and betel leaf is a good remedy against bad breath. Diplomat Edmund Roberts noted that Chinese people would mix areca nut with &quot;Uncaria gambir&quot; during his visit to China in the 1830s. After chewing a betel nut, the red residue is generally spat out. Accordingly, places have banned chewing this nut to avoid eyesores.

=== Chemistry ===
The major alkaloid in betel nut is arecoline. There are other compounds, such as arecaidine, guvacine, isoguvacine, and guvacoline. Tannins present in betel nut are mainly proanthocyanidins along with catechins and arecatannin. Two new alkaloids were recently discovered and named acatechu A and acatechu B. Several non-alkaloid compounds including benzenoids, terpenes, carboxylic acids, aldehydes, alcohols, and esters were also identified.

==Toxicity==

Chewing areca nut increases the risk of multiple forms of cancer and cardiovascular disease, with or without added tobacco.

Betel nut chewing causes an increased risk of head and neck cancers and esophageal cancer. Betel quid affects almost all parts of the human body, including the brain, heart, lungs, gastrointestinal tract and reproductive organs. It can cause myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, liver damage, asthma, type II diabetes, hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome, hypothyroidism, prostate hyperplasia and infertility. Habitual chewing of areca nuts increases the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Chewing areca nuts is a cause of oral submucous fibrosis, a condition which may progress to mouth cancer. It has also been linked to throat cancer.

When chewed with additional tobacco in its preparation (like in gutka), there is an even higher risk for cancer, especially for oral and oropharyngeal cancers. With tobacco it also raises the risk of fatal coronary artery disease, fatal stroke and non-fatal ischaemic heart disease

Women who chew areca nut formulations, such as &quot;paan&quot;, during pregnancy significantly increase adverse outcomes for the baby. Betel quid chewing can cause stillbirth, premature birth, and low birth weight.

The harm caused by consumption of areca nuts worldwide was classified in 2017 as a &quot;neglected global public health emergency&quot;.

=== During pregnancy ===
Using tobacco or areca nuts during pregnancy significantly increases adverse outcomes for the baby. The habit is associated with higher incidences of preterm birth and low birth weight and height. Biologically, these effects may be a consequence of the arecoline that is found in areca nuts. The habit also exposes the fetus to various other toxic components linked to cancer.

== Modern-day consumption ==

=== Production ===
In 2017, world production of areca nut was 1.3 million tonnes, with India providing 54% of the total. As other leading producers, Myanmar, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Taiwan combined contributed 38% of the world total.



===South Asia===
In India (the largest consumer of areca nut) and the rest of the Indian subcontinent, the preparation of nut with or without betel leaf is commonly referred to as &quot;paan&quot;. It is available practically everywhere and is sold in ready-to-chew pouches called &quot;pan masala&quot; or &quot;supari&quot;, which is the dried form of the areca nut, as a mixture of many flavours whose primary base is dried areca nut crushed into small pieces. Poor people, who may eat only every other day, use it to stave off hunger pangs. &quot;Pan masala&quot; with a small quantity of tobacco is called &quot;gutka&quot;. The easily discarded, small plastic &quot;supari&quot; or &quot;gutka&quot; pouches are a ubiquitous pollutant of the South Asian environment. Some of the liquid in the mouth is usually disposed of by spitting, producing bright red spots wherever the expectorate lands.

In the Maldives, areca nut chewing is very popular, but spitting is frowned upon and regarded as an unrefined, repulsive way of chewing. Usually, people prefer to chew thin slices of the dry nut, which is sometimes roasted. &quot;Kili&quot;, a mixture of areca nut, betel, cloves, cardamom and sugar is sold in small home-made paper pouches. Old people who have lost their teeth keep &quot;chewing&quot; by pounding the mixture of areca nut and betel with a small mortar and pestle.

===Southeast Asia===
In Thailand, the consumption of areca nut has declined gradually in the last decades. The younger generation rarely chews the substance, especially in the cities. Most of the present-day consumption is confined to older generations, mostly people above 50. Even so, small trays of betel leaves and sliced tender areca nut are sold in markets and used as offerings in Buddhist shrines.

In the northern Philippines, particularly the Cordillera Administrative Region, betel nut chewing remains prominent to the point that restrictions and fines have been established in urban areas such as Baguio City in the Benguet province. These restrictions were made under the idea that &quot;momma&quot; or &quot;moma&quot; (betel nut) chewing and spitting are improper during public transportation drivers&#x27; work hours and are considered stains to the city roads and sidewalks. Despite these restrictions, betel nut thrives across the Cordilleran market. An example of its commerciality can be observed in Ifugao, one of the provinces of the Philippine Cordilleras, where betel nuts are high-demand products sourced from the province&#x27;s different cities and municipalities.

In Bahasa Indonesia, the betel nut is known as &quot;makan pinang&quot;, while in the Papua Province of Indonesia, it is known simply as &quot;pinang&quot;.

===Oceania===

In Papua New Guinea (PNG), betel nuts are referred to in Tok Pisin as &quot;buai&quot;, and grow abundantly on the northern coast, in Wewak and Madang. A controversial ban on selling and chewing betel nut in public places in Port Moresby, introduced in 2014 by the governor, was lifted in 2017. Because the popular nut continued to be smuggled in, prices rose dramatically. Police enforced the ban rigorously, and in 2015 two betel nut sellers died in Hanuabada after police reservists fired on a crowd. The governor of Port Moresby introduced another ban on the nut, restricted to an area in the business district of the city in July 2023. However many people make a living out of selling betel nut, so are resistant to bans in their areas. On Manus Island, young men are exposed to piracy when they use small boats to travel to the northern coast to purchase betel nuts to trade, and several have disappeared.

In Australia, the importation, use, and sale of areca nut is banned, but it has been sold illegally in several South Asian supermarkets.

===East Asia===
In Taiwan, bags of 20 to 40 areca nuts are purchased fresh daily by a large number of consumers. To meet the steady year-round demand, two kinds of betel-nut shops sell betel and nuts, as well as cigarettes and drinks, including beer: Small mom and pop shops, often poorly maintained and with unassuming façades, and shops which will often consist of nothing more than a single, free-standing room, or booth. The latter is usually elevated one meter above the street, and measures less than 3 by 2 m. Large picture windows comprise two or more of the walls, allowing those who pass by a complete view of the interior. The interior is often painted brightly. Within such a shop, a sexily dressed young woman, a &quot;betel nut beauty&quot;, can be seen preparing betel and areca nuts. Shops are often identified by colorful (commonly green) LED lamps or neon lights that frame the windows or that are arranged radially above a store. Customers stop on the side of the road and wait for the girls to bring their betel and areca nut to their vehicles. The habit of chewing betel nut is often associated with blue-collar labor industries such as long-haul transportation, construction, or fishing. Workers in these labor-intensive industries use betel nut for its stimulating effect, but it also becomes a tool for socializing with coworkers. For example, studies have shown chewing betel nut is prevalent among taxi, bus and truck drivers, who rely on the stimulating effect of betel nut to cope with long work hours. For these reasons, oral cancer has been identified as a leading cause of death in professions with high betel nut-chewing rates.

In Hainan and Hunan Province, China, where Xiangtan is a center of use and processing, a wide range of old and young people consume areca nut daily. Most, though, consume the dried variety of the nut by itself, without the betel leaves. Some people also consume the areca nut in its raw, fresh form with or without the betel leaves. Betel nuts are sold mostly by old women merchants, but the dried version can be found in shops that sell tea, alcohol, and cigarettes.

===Other countries===
In the United States, areca nut is not a controlled or specially taxed substance and may be found in some Asian grocery stores. However, importation of areca nut in a form other than whole or carved kernels of nuts can be stopped at the discretion of US Customs officers on the grounds of food, agricultural, or medicinal drug violations. 

In the United Kingdom the betel nut is legal. 

Possession of areca nut or betel leaf is banned in the UAE and is a punishable offence.

==In culture==

=== Traditional consumption ===

Chewing the mixture of areca nut and betel leaf constitutes an important and popular cultural activity in many South Asian, Southeast Asian, East Asian and Oceanic countries. Why or when the areca nut and the betel leaf were first combined into one psychoactive drug is not known. Archaeological evidence from Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines suggests they have been used in tandem for at least 4,000 years.

The oldest unequivocal evidence of betel chewing is from the Philippines, specifically that of several individuals found in a burial pit in the Duyong Cave site of Palawan island dated to around 2680±250 BCE. The dentition of the skeletons is stained, typical of betel chewers. The grave also includes &quot;Anadara&quot; shells used as containers of lime, one of which still contained lime. Burial sites in Bohol dated to the first millennium CE also show the distinctive reddish stains characteristic of betel chewing. Based on linguistic evidence of how the reconstructed Proto-Austronesian term &quot;*buaq&quot; originally meaning &quot;fruit&quot; came to refer to &quot;areca nut&quot; in Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, it is believed that betel chewing originally developed somewhere within the Philippines shortly after the beginning of the Austronesian expansion (~3000 BCE). From the Philippines, it spread back to Taiwan, as well as onwards to the rest of Austronesia and in neighboring cultures through trade and migration.

In Vietnam, the areca nut and the betel leaf are such important symbols of love and marriage that in Vietnamese the phrase &quot;matters of betel and areca&quot; (&quot;chuyện trầu cau&quot;) is synonymous with marriage. The tradition of chewing areca nuts starts the talk between the groom&#x27;s parents and the bride&#x27;s parents about the young couple&#x27;s marriage. Therefore, the leaves and juices are used ceremonially in Vietnamese weddings. The folk tale explaining the origin of this Vietnamese tradition is a good illustration of the belief that the combination of areca nut and the betel leaf is ideal to the point they are practically inseparable, like an idealized married couple.

Formerly, in both India and Sri Lanka, it was a custom of the royalty to chew areca nut with betel leaf. Kings had special attendants whose duty it was to carry a box with all the necessary ingredients for a good chewing session. There was also a custom for lovers to chew areca nut and betel leaf together, because of its breath-freshening and relaxant properties. A sexual symbolism thus became attached to the chewing of the nut and the leaf. The areca nut represented the male principle, and the betel leaf the female principle. Considered an auspicious ingredient in Hinduism and some schools of Buddhism, the areca nut is still used along with betel leaf in religious ceremonies, and also while honoring individuals in much of southern Asia.

In Assam, as well as most of its neighbouring Northeastern states, Areca Nut is preferably consumed in its fermented form, which is supposed to make the fruit harder and sweeter. The raw nut may also be eaten during certain seasons when the fermented variety becomes unavailable, although it has more of ritual importance. Standard sized pieces of the nut and leaf are usually consumed in combination with lime and a bit of tobacco. In Assam, betel nut and leaf has indispensable cultural value; offering betel leaf and nut, (together known as &quot;gua&quot;) constitutes a part of social greeting and socialising. It is a tradition to offer &quot;pan-tamul&quot; (betel leaves and raw areca nut) to guests immediately upon arrival, and after tea or meals, served in a brass plate with stands called &quot;bota&quot;. In traditional Assamese societies carrying a pouch of &quot;tamul-pan&quot; upon one&#x27;s person during journeys or during farming activities, and sharing of the same, was an essential requirement. Among the Assamese, the areca nut also has a variety of uses during religious and marriage ceremonies, where it has the role of a fertility symbol. No religious ritual is complete without the offering of &quot;tamul-pan&quot; to the gods and spirits as well as to the assembled guests A tradition from Upper Assam is to invite guests to wedding receptions by offering a few areca nuts with betel leaves. During Bihu, the &quot;husori&quot; players are offered areca nuts and betel leaves by each household while their blessings are solicited.

Spanish mariner Álvaro de Mendaña reported observing Solomon Islanders chewing the nut and the leaf with caustic lime, and the manner in which the habit stained their mouths red. He noted the friendly and genial chief Malope, on Santa Isabel Island, would offer him the combination as a token of friendship every time they met.

In Bhutan, the areca nut is called &quot;doma&quot;. The soft and moist raw areca nut is very potent. When chewed it can cause palpitation and vasoconstriction. This form is eaten in the lower regions of Bhutan and in North Bengal, where the nut is cut into half and put into a local &quot;paan&quot; leaf with a generous amount of lime. In the rest of Bhutan the raw nut, with the husk on, is fermented such that the husk rots and is easy to extract. The fermented doma has a putrid odour, which can be smelled from miles. Traditionally, this fragrant nut is cut in half and placed on top of a cone made of local betel leaf, which has a dash of lime put into it. &quot;Myth has it that the inhabitants of Bhutan traditionally known as Monyul, the land of Monpas where Buddhism did not reach lived on raw flesh, drank blood, and chewed bones. After the arrival of Guru Rinpoche in the eighth century, he stopped the people from eating flesh and drinking blood and created a substitute which is betel leaf, lime and areca nut. Today, chewing doma has become a custom. Doma is served after meals, during rituals and ceremonies. It is offered to friends and is chewed at work places by all sections of society and has become an essential part of Bhutanese life and culture.&quot;

The addition of tobacco leaf to the chewing mixture is a relatively recent innovation, as tobacco was not introduced from the Americas until the colonial era.

Reasons for starting to consume areca nuts appears to involve complex psychosocial factors.

=== Place names ===
Places such as Guwahati in India, Penang in Malaysia, Ko Mak (เกาะหมาก) in Thailand, Fua Mulaku in Maldives and Binlang Islet in Taiwan have been named after the areca nut.

<doc id="49887" wikidata="Q721706" url="?curid=49887" title="Standard enthalpy of formation">
<text>In chemistry and thermodynamics, the standard enthalpy of formation or standard heat of formation of a compound is the change of enthalpy during the formation of 1 mole of the substance from its constituent elements in their reference state, with all substances in their standard states. The standard pressure value is recommended by IUPAC, although prior to 1982 the value 1.00 atm (101.325 kPa) was used. There is no standard temperature. Its symbol is Δf&quot;H&quot;⦵. The superscript Plimsoll on this symbol indicates that the process has occurred under standard conditions at the specified temperature (usually 25 °C or 298.15 K).

Standard states are defined for various types of substances. For a gas, it is the hypothetical state the gas would assume if it obeyed the ideal gas equation at a pressure of 1 bar. For a gaseous or solid solute present in a diluted ideal solution, the standard state is the hypothetical state of concentration of the solute of exactly one mole per liter (1 M) at a pressure of 1 bar extrapolated from infinite dilution. For a pure substance or a solvent in a condensed state (a liquid or a solid) the standard state is the pure liquid or solid under a pressure of 1 bar.

For elements that have multiple allotropes, the reference state usually is chosen to be the form in which the element is most stable under 1 bar of pressure. One exception is phosphorus, for which the most stable form at 1 bar is black phosphorus, but white phosphorus is chosen as the standard reference state for zero enthalpy of formation.

For example, the standard enthalpy of formation of carbon dioxide is the enthalpy of the following reaction under the above conditions:
:&lt;chem&gt;C(s, graphite) + O2(g) -&gt; CO2(g)&lt;/chem&gt;
All elements are written in their standard states, and one mole of product is formed. This is true for all enthalpies of formation.

The standard enthalpy of formation is measured in units of energy per amount of substance, usually stated in kilojoule per mole (kJ mol−1), but also in kilocalorie per mole, joule per mole or kilocalorie per gram (any combination of these units conforming to the energy per mass or amount guideline).

All elements in their reference states (oxygen gas, solid carbon in the form of graphite, etc.) have a standard enthalpy of formation of zero, as there is no change involved in their formation.

The formation reaction is a constant pressure and constant temperature process. Since the pressure of the standard formation reaction is fixed at 1 bar, the standard formation enthalpy or reaction heat is a function of temperature. For tabulation purposes, standard formation enthalpies are all given at a single temperature: 298 K, represented by the symbol .

== Hess&#x27; law ==
For many substances, the formation reaction may be considered as the sum of a number of simpler reactions, either real or fictitious. The enthalpy of reaction can then be analyzed by applying Hess&#x27; law, which states that the &quot;sum&quot; of the enthalpy changes for a number of individual reaction steps equals the enthalpy change of the overall reaction. This is true because enthalpy is a state function, whose value for an overall process depends only on the initial and final states and not on any intermediate states. Examples are given in the following sections.

== Ionic compounds: Born–Haber cycle ==

For ionic compounds, the standard enthalpy of formation is equivalent to the sum of several terms included in the Born–Haber cycle. For example, the formation of lithium fluoride,

:&lt;chem&gt;Li(s) + 1/2 F2(g) -&gt; LiF(s)&lt;/chem&gt;

may be considered as the sum of several steps, each with its own enthalpy (or energy, approximately): 
# , the standard enthalpy of atomization (or sublimation) of solid lithium.
# , the first ionization energy of gaseous lithium.
# , the standard enthalpy of atomization (or bond energy) of fluorine gas.
# , the electron affinity of a fluorine atom.
# , the lattice energy of lithium fluoride.

The sum of these enthalpies give the standard enthalpy of formation () of lithium fluoride:

:formula_1

In practice, the enthalpy of formation of lithium fluoride can be determined experimentally, but the lattice energy cannot be measured directly. The equation is therefore rearranged to evaluate the lattice energy:

:formula_2

==Organic compounds==
The formation reactions for most organic compounds are hypothetical. For instance, carbon and hydrogen will not directly react to form methane (), so that the standard enthalpy of formation cannot be measured directly. However the standard enthalpy of combustion is readily measurable using bomb calorimetry. The standard enthalpy of formation is then determined using Hess&#x27;s law. The combustion of methane:
:&lt;chem&gt;CH4 + 2 O2 -&gt; CO2 + 2 H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
is equivalent to the sum of the hypothetical decomposition into elements followed by the combustion of the elements to form carbon dioxide () and water ():
:&lt;chem&gt;CH4 -&gt; C + 2H2&lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;C + O2 -&gt; CO2&lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;2H2 + O2 -&gt; 2H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

Applying Hess&#x27;s law, 
:formula_3

Solving for the standard of enthalpy of formation,
:formula_4

The value of is determined to be −74.8 kJ/mol. The negative sign shows that the reaction, if it were to proceed, would be exothermic; that is, methane is enthalpically more stable than hydrogen gas and carbon.

It is possible to predict heats of formation for simple unstrained organic compounds with the heat of formation group additivity method.

== Use in calculation for other reactions ==
The standard enthalpy change of any reaction can be calculated from the standard enthalpies of formation of reactants and products using Hess&#x27;s law. A given reaction is considered as the decomposition of all reactants into elements in their standard states, followed by the formation of all products. The heat of reaction is then &quot;minus&quot; the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants (each being multiplied by its respective stoichiometric coefficient, ) &quot;plus&quot; the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the products (each also multiplied by its respective stoichiometric coefficient), as shown in the equation below:

:formula_5

If the standard enthalpy of the products is less than the standard enthalpy of the reactants, the standard enthalpy of reaction is negative. This implies that the reaction is exothermic. The converse is also true; the standard enthalpy of reaction is positive for an endothermic reaction. This calculation has a tacit assumption of ideal solution between reactants and products where the enthalpy of mixing is zero.

For example, for the combustion of methane, &lt;chem&gt;CH4 + 2O2 -&gt; CO2 + 2H2O&lt;/chem&gt;:

:formula_6
However &lt;chem&gt;O2&lt;/chem&gt; is an element in its standard state, so that formula_7, and the heat of reaction is simplified to 
:formula_8
which is the equation in the previous section for the enthalpy of combustion formula_9.

== Key concepts for enthalpy calculations ==
*When a reaction is reversed, the magnitude of Δ&quot;H&quot; stays the same, but the sign changes.
*When the balanced equation for a reaction is multiplied by an integer, the corresponding value of Δ&quot;H&quot; must be multiplied by that integer as well.
*The change in enthalpy for a reaction can be calculated from the enthalpies of formation of the reactants and the products
*Elements in their standard states make no contribution to the enthalpy calculations for the reaction, since the enthalpy of an element in its standard state is zero. Allotropes of an element other than the standard state generally have non-zero standard enthalpies of formation.

<doc id="49890" wikidata="Q3127419" url="?curid=49890" title="Herring">
<text>Herring are various species of forage fish, belonging to the order Clupeiformes.

Herring often move in large schools around fishing banks and near the coast, found particularly in shallow, temperate waters of the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans, including the Baltic Sea, as well as off the west coast of South America. Three species of &quot;Clupea&quot; (the type genus of the herring family Clupeidae) are recognised, and comprise about 90% of all herrings captured in fisheries. The most abundant of these species is the Atlantic herring, which comprises over half of all herring capture. Fish called herring are also found in the Arabian Sea, Indian Ocean, and Bay of Bengal.

Herring played an important role in the history of marine fisheries in Europe, and early in the 20th century, their study was fundamental to the development of fisheries science. These oily fish also have a long history as an important food fish, and are often salted, smoked, or pickled.

Herring were also known as &quot;silver darlings&quot; in the United Kingdom.

==Species==
A number of different species, most belonging to the family Clupeidae, are commonly referred to as herrings. The origins of the term &quot;herring&quot; is somewhat unclear, though it may derive from the same source as the Old High German &quot;heri&quot; meaning a &quot;host, multitude&quot;, in reference to the large schools they form.

The type genus of the herring family Clupeidae is &quot;Clupea&quot;. &quot;Clupea&quot; contains only two species: the Atlantic herring (the type species) found in the North Atlantic, and the Pacific herring mainly found in the North Pacific. Subspecific divisions have been suggested for both the Atlantic and Pacific herrings, but their biological basis remains unclear.

In addition, a number of related species, all in the Clupeidae, are commonly referred to as herrings. The table immediately below includes those members of the family Clupeidae referred to by FishBase as herrings which have been assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Also, a number of other species are called herrings, which may be related to clupeids or just share some characteristics of herrings (such as the lake herring, which is a salmonid). Just which of these species are called herrings can vary with locality, so what might be called a herring in one locality might be called something else in another locality. Some examples:

==Characteristics==

The species of &quot;Clupea&quot; belong to the larger family Clupeidae (herrings, shads, sardines, menhadens), which comprises some 200 species that share similar features. These silvery-coloured fish have a single dorsal fin, which is soft, without spines. They have no lateral line and have a protruding lower jaw. Their size varies between subspecies: the Baltic herring (&quot;Clupea harengus membras&quot;) is small, 14 to 18 cm (about 5.5 to 7 inches); the proper Atlantic herring (&quot;Clupea harengus harengus&quot;) can grow to about and weigh up ; and Pacific herring grow to about .

==Life cycle==
At least one stock of Atlantic herring spawns in every month of the year. Each spawns at a different time and place (spring, summer, autumn, and winter herrings). Greenland populations spawn in of water, while North Sea (bank) herrings spawn at down to in autumn. Eggs are laid on the sea bed, on rock, stones, gravel, sand or beds of algae. Females may deposit from 20,000 to 40,000 eggs, according to age and size, averaging about 30,000. In sexually mature herring, the genital organs grow before spawning, reaching about one-fifth of its total weight.

The eggs sink to the bottom, where they stick in layers or clumps to gravel, seaweed, or stones, by means of their mucous coating, or to any other objects on which they chance to settle.

If the egg layers are too thick they suffer from oxygen depletion and often die, entangled in a maze of mucus. They need substantial water microturbulence, generally provided by wave action or coastal currents. Survival is highest in crevices and behind solid structures, because predators feast on openly exposed eggs. The individual eggs are in diameter, depending on the size of the parent fish and also on the local race. Incubation time is about 40 days at , 15 days at , or 11 days at . Eggs die at temperatures above .

The larvae are long at hatching, with a small yolk sac that is absorbed by the time the larvae reach . Only the eyes are well pigmented. The rest of the body is nearly transparent, virtually invisible under water and in natural lighting conditions.

The dorsal fin forms at , the anal fin at about —the ventral fins are visible and the tail becomes well forked at 30 to — at about , the larva begins to look like a herring.

Herring larvae are very slender and can easily be distinguished from all other young fish of their range by the location of the vent, which lies close to the base of the tail; however, distinguishing clupeoids one from another in their early stages requires critical examination, especially telling herring from sprats.

At one year, they are about long, and they first spawn at three years.

==Ecology==

===Prey===
Herrings consume copepods, arrow worms, pelagic amphipods, mysids, and krill in the pelagic zone. Conversely, they are a central prey item or forage fish for higher trophic levels. The reasons for this success are still enigmatic; one speculation attributes their dominance to the huge, extremely fast cruising schools they inhabit.

Herring feed on phytoplankton, and as they mature, they start to consume larger organisms. They also feed on zooplankton, tiny animals found in oceanic surface waters, and small fish and fish larvae. Copepods and other tiny crustaceans are the most common zooplankton eaten by herring. During daylight, herring stay in the safety of deep water, feeding at the surface only at night when the chance of being seen by predators is less. They swim along with their mouths open, filtering the plankton from the water as it passes through their gills.
Young herring mostly hunt copepods individually, by means of &quot;particulate feeding&quot; or &quot;raptorial feeding&quot;, a feeding method also used by adult herring on larger prey items like krill. If prey concentrations reach very high levels, as in microlayers, at fronts, or directly below the surface, herring become filter feeders, driving several meters forward with wide open mouth and far expanded opercula, then closing and cleaning the gill rakers for a few milliseconds.

Copepods, the primary zooplankton, are a major item on the forage fish menu. Copepods are typically long, with a teardrop-shaped body. Some scientists say they form the largest animal biomass on the planet. Copepods are very alert and evasive. They have large antennae (see photo below left). When they spread their antennae, they can sense the pressure wave from an approaching fish and jump with great speed over a few centimetres. If copepod concentrations reach high levels, schooling herrings adopt a method called ram feeding. In the photo below, herring ram feed on a school of copepods. They swim with their mouths wide open and their operculae fully expanded.

The fish swim in a grid where the distance between them is the same as the jump length of their prey, as indicated in the animation above right. In the animation, juvenile herring hunt the copepods in this synchronised way. The copepods sense with their antennae the pressure wave of an approaching herring and react with a fast escape jump. The length of the jump is fairly constant. The fish align themselves in a grid with this characteristic jump length. A copepod can dart about 80 times before it tires. After a jump, it takes it 60 milliseconds to spread its antennae again, and this time delay becomes its undoing, as the almost endless stream of herring allows a herring to eventually snap up the copepod. A single juvenile herring could never catch a large copepod.

Other pelagic prey eaten by herring includes fish eggs, larval snails, diatoms by herring larvae below , tintinnids by larvae below , molluscan larvae, menhaden larvae, krill, mysids, smaller fishes, pteropods, annelids, &quot;Calanus&quot; spp., Centropagidae, and &quot;Meganyctiphanes norvegica&quot;.

Herrings, along with Atlantic cod and sprat, are the most important commercial species to humans in the Baltic Sea. The analysis of the stomach contents of these fish indicate Atlantic cod is the top predator, preying on the herring and sprat. Sprat are competitive with herring for the same food resources. This is evident in the two species&#x27; vertical migration in the Baltic Sea, where they compete for the limited zooplankton available and necessary for their survival. Sprat are highly selective in their diet and eat only zooplankton, while herring are more eclectic, adjusting their diet as they grow in size. In the Baltic, copepods of the genus &quot;Acartia&quot; can be present in large numbers. However, they are small in size with a high escape response, so herring and sprat avoid trying to catch them. These copepods also tend to dwell more in surface waters, whereas herring and sprat, especially during the day, tend to dwell in deeper waters.

===Predators===


Predators of herring include seabirds, marine mammals such as dolphins, porpoises, whales, seals, and sea lions, predatory fish such as sharks, billfish, tuna, salmon, striped bass, cod, and halibut. Fishermen also catch and eat herring.

The predators often cooperate in groups, using different techniques to panic or herd a school of herring into a tight bait ball. Different predatory species then use different techniques to pick the fish off in the bait ball. The sailfish raises its sail to make it appear much larger. Swordfish charge at high speed through the bait balls, slashing with their swords to kill or stun prey. They then turn and return to consume their &quot;catch&quot;. Thresher sharks use their long tails to stun the shoaling fish. These sharks compact their prey school by swimming around them and splashing the water with their tails, often in pairs or small groups. They then strike them sharply with the upper lobe of their tails to stun them. Spinner sharks charge vertically through the school, spinning on their axes with their mouths open and snapping all around. The sharks&#x27; momentum at the end of these spiraling runs often carries them into the air.

Some whales lunge feed on bait balls. Lunge feeding is an extreme feeding method, where the whale accelerates from below the bait ball to a high velocity and then opens its mouth to a large gape angle. This generates the water pressure required to expand its mouth and engulf and filter a huge amount of water and fish. Lunge feeding by rorquals, a family of huge baleen whales that includes the blue whale, is said to be the largest biomechanical event on Earth.

==Fisheries==
Adult herring are harvested for their flesh and eggs, and they are often used as baitfish. The trade in herring is an important sector of many economies around the world. In Europe, the fish has been called the &quot;silver of the sea&quot;, and its trade has been so significant to many countries that it has been regarded as the most commercially important fishery in history.



==As food==

Herring has been a staple food source since at least 3000 BC. The fish is served numerous ways, and many regional recipes are used: eaten raw, fermented, pickled, or cured by other techniques, such as being smoked as kippers.

Herring are very high in the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. They are a source of vitamin D.

Water pollution influences the amount of herring that may be safely consumed. For example, large Baltic herring slightly exceeds recommended limits with respect to PCB and dioxin, although some sources point out that the cancer-reducing effect of omega-3 fatty acids is statistically stronger than the carcinogenic effect of PCBs and dioxins. The contaminant levels depend on the age of the fish which can be inferred from their size. Baltic herrings larger than may be eaten twice a month, while herrings smaller than 17 cm can be eaten freely. Mercury in fish also influences the amount of fish that women who are pregnant or planning to be pregnant within the next one or two years may safely eat.

==History==
The herring has played a highly significant role in history both socially and economically. During the Middle Ages, herring prompted the founding of Great Yarmouth and Copenhagen and played a critical role in the medieval development of Amsterdam. In 1274, while on his deathbed at the monastery of Fossanova (south of Rome, Italy), when encouraged to eat something to regain his strength, Thomas Aquinas asked for fresh herring.

<text>The Socratic method (also known as the method of Elenchus or Socratic debate) is a form of argumentative dialogue between individuals based on asking and answering questions. Socratic dialogues feature in many of the works of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato, where his teacher Socrates debates various philosophical issues with an &quot;interlocutor&quot; or &quot;partner&quot;.

In Plato&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Theaetetus&quot;, Socrates describes his method as a form of &quot;midwifery&quot; because it is employed to help his interlocutors develop their understanding in a way analogous to a child developing in the womb. The Socratic method begins with commonly held beliefs and scrutinizes them by way of questioning to determine their internal consistency and their coherence with other beliefs and so to bring everyone closer to the truth.

In modified forms, it is employed today in a variety of pedagogical contexts.

==Development==
In the second half of the 5th century BC, sophists were teachers who specialized in using the tools of philosophy and rhetoric to entertain, impress, or persuade an audience to accept the speaker&#x27;s point of view. Socrates promoted an alternative method of teaching, which came to be called the Socratic method.

Socrates began to engage in such discussions with his fellow Athenians after his friend from youth, Chaerephon, visited the Oracle of Delphi, which asserted that no man in Greece was wiser than Socrates. Socrates saw this as a paradox, and began using the Socratic method to answer his conundrum. Diogenes Laërtius, however, wrote that Protagoras invented the &quot;Socratic&quot; method.

Plato famously formalized the Socratic elenctic style in prose—presenting Socrates as the curious questioner of some prominent Athenian interlocutor—in some of his early dialogues, such as &quot;Euthyphro&quot; and &quot;Ion&quot;, and the method is most commonly found within the so-called &quot;Socratic dialogues&quot;, which generally portray Socrates engaging in the method and questioning his fellow citizens about moral and epistemological issues. But in his later dialogues, such as Theaetetus or Sophist, Plato had a different method to philosophical discussions, namely dialectic.

==Method==
 () is the central technique of the Socratic method. The Latin form (plural ) is used in English as the technical philosophical term. The most common adjectival form in English is ; and are also current. This was also very important in Plato&#x27;s early dialogues.
Socrates (as depicted by Plato) generally applied his method of examination to concepts such as the virtues of piety, wisdom, temperance, courage, and justice. Such an examination challenged the implicit moral beliefs of the interlocutors, bringing out inadequacies and inconsistencies in their beliefs, and usually resulting in aporia. In view of such inadequacies, Socrates himself professed ignorance. Socrates said that his awareness of his ignorance made him wiser than those who, though ignorant, still claimed knowledge. This claim was based on a reported Delphic oracular pronouncement that no man was wiser than Socrates. While this belief seems paradoxical at first glance, in fact it allowed Socrates to discover his own errors. 

Socrates used this claim of wisdom as the basis of moral exhortation. He claimed that the chief goodness consists in the caring of the soul concerned with moral truth and moral understanding, that &quot;wealth does not bring goodness, but goodness brings wealth and every other blessing, both to the individual and to the state&quot;, and that &quot;life without examination [dialogue] is not worth living&quot;. 

Socrates rarely used the method to actually develop consistent theories, and he even made frequent use of creative myths and allegories. The Parmenides dialogue shows Parmenides using the Socratic method to point out the flaws in the Platonic theory of forms, as presented by Socrates; it is not the only dialogue in which theories normally expounded by Plato&#x27;s Socrates are broken down through dialectic. Instead of arriving at answers, the method breaks down the theories we hold, to go &quot;beyond&quot; the axioms and postulates we take for granted. Therefore, myth and the Socratic method are not meant by Plato to be incompatible; they have different purposes, and are often described as the &quot;left hand&quot; and &quot;right hand&quot; paths to good and wisdom. 

===Scholarly debate===
In Plato&#x27;s early dialogues, the elenchus is the technique Socrates uses to investigate, for example, the nature or definition of ethical concepts such as justice or virtue. According to Gregory Vlastos, it has the following steps:

# Socrates&#x27; interlocutor asserts a thesis, for example &quot;Courage is endurance of the soul&quot;.
# Socrates decides whether the thesis is false and targets for refutation.
# Socrates secures his interlocutor&#x27;s agreement to further premises, for example &quot;Courage is a fine thing&quot; and &quot;Ignorant endurance is not a fine thing&quot;.
# Socrates then argues, and the interlocutor agrees, these further premises imply the contrary of the original thesis; in this case, it leads to: &quot;courage is not endurance of the soul&quot;.
# Socrates then claims he has shown his interlocutor&#x27;s thesis is false and its negation is true.

One elenctic examination can lead to a new, more refined, examination of the concept being considered, in this case it invites an examination of the claim: &quot;Courage is endurance of the soul&quot;. Most Socratic inquiries consist of a series of and typically end in puzzlement known as .

Michael Frede points out Vlastos&#x27; conclusion in step No. 5 above makes nonsense of the aporetic nature of the early dialogues. Having shown a proposed thesis is false is insufficient to conclude some other competing thesis must be true. Rather, the interlocutors have reached aporia, an improved state of still not knowing what to say about the subject under discussion.

The exact nature of the elenchus is subject to a great deal of debate, in particular concerning whether it is a positive method, leading to knowledge, or a negative method used solely to refute false claims to knowledge. Some qualitative research shows that the use of the Socratic method within a traditional Yeshiva education setting helps students succeed in law school, although it remains an open question as to whether that relationship is causal or merely correlative.

Yet, W. K. C. Guthrie in &quot;The Greek Philosophers&quot; sees it as an error to regard the Socratic method as a means by which one seeks the answer to a problem, or knowledge. Guthrie claims that the Socratic method actually aims to demonstrate one&#x27;s ignorance. Socrates, unlike the Sophists, did believe that knowledge was possible, but believed that the first step to knowledge was recognition of one&#x27;s ignorance. Guthrie writes, &quot;[Socrates] was accustomed to say that he did not himself know anything, and that the only way in which he was wiser than other men was that he was conscious of his own ignorance, while they were not. The essence of the Socratic method is to convince the interlocutor that whereas he thought he knew something, in fact he does not.&quot;

==Modern applications==

===Socratic seminar===
A Socratic seminar (also known as a Socratic circle) is a pedagogical approach based on the Socratic method and uses a dialogic approach to understand information in a text. Its systematic procedure is used to examine a text through questions and answers founded on the beliefs that all new knowledge is connected to prior knowledge, that all thinking comes from asking questions, and that asking one question should lead to asking further questions. A Socratic seminar is not a debate. The goal of this activity is to have participants work together to construct meaning and arrive at an answer, not for one student or one group to &quot;win the argument&quot;.

This approach is based on the belief that participants seek and gain deeper understanding of concepts in the text through thoughtful dialogue rather than memorizing information that has been provided for them. While Socratic seminars can differ in structure, and even in name, they typically involve a passage of text that students must read beforehand and facilitate dialogue. Sometimes, a facilitator will structure two concentric circles of students: an outer circle and an inner circle. The inner circle focuses on exploring and analysing the text through the act of questioning and answering. During this phase, the outer circle remains silent. Students in the outer circle are much like scientific observers watching and listening to the conversation of the inner circle. When the text has been fully discussed and the inner circle is finished talking, the outer circle provides feedback on the dialogue that took place. This process alternates with the inner circle students going to the outer circle for the next meeting and vice versa. The length of this process varies depending on the text used for the discussion. The teacher may decide to alternate groups within one meeting, or they may alternate at each separate meeting.

The most significant difference between this activity and most typical classroom activities involves the role of the teacher. In Socratic seminar, the students lead the discussion and questioning. The teacher&#x27;s role is to ensure the discussion advances regardless of the particular direction the discussion takes.

====Various approaches to Socratic seminar====
Teachers use Socratic seminar in different ways. The structure it takes may look different in each classroom. While this is not an exhaustive list, teachers may use one of the following structures to administer Socratic seminar:

# &quot;Inner/outer circle or fishbowl&quot;: Students need to be arranged in inner and outer circles. The inner circle engages in discussion about the text. The outer circle observes the inner circle, while taking notes. The outer circle shares their observations and questions the inner circle with guidance from the teacher/facilitator. Students use constructive criticism as opposed to making judgements. The students on the outside keep track of topics they would like to discuss as part of the debrief. Participants in the outer circle can use an observation checklist or notes form to monitor the participants in the inner circle. These tools will provide structure for listening and give the outside members specific details to discuss later in the seminar. The teacher may also sit in the circle but at the same height as the students.
# &quot;Triad&quot;: Students are arranged so that each participant (called a &quot;pilot&quot;) in the inner circle has two &quot;co-pilots&quot; sitting behind them on either side. Pilots are the speakers because they are in the inner circle; co-pilots are in the outer circle and only speak during consultation. The seminar proceeds as any other seminar. At a point in the seminar, the facilitator pauses the discussion and instructs the triad to talk to each other. Conversation will be about topics that need more in-depth discussion or a question posed by the leader. Sometimes triads will be asked by the facilitator to come up with a new question. Any time during a triad conversation, group members can switch seats and one of the co-pilots can sit in the pilot&#x27;s seat. Only during that time is the switching of seats allowed. This structure allows for students to speak, who may not yet have the confidence to speak in the large group. This type of seminar involves all students instead of just the students in the inner and outer circles.
# &quot;Simultaneous seminars&quot;: Students are arranged in multiple small groups and placed as far as possible from each other. Following the guidelines of the Socratic seminar, students engage in small group discussions. Simultaneous seminars are typically done with experienced students who need little guidance and can engage in a discussion without assistance from a teacher/facilitator. According to the literature, this type of seminar is beneficial for teachers who want students to explore a variety of texts around a main issue or topic. Each small group may have a different text to read/view and discuss. A larger Socratic seminar can then occur as a discussion about how each text corresponds with one another. Simultaneous Seminars can also be used for a particularly difficult text. Students can work through different issues and key passages from the text.

No matter what structure the teacher employs, the basic premise of the seminar/circles is to turn partial control and direction of the classroom over to the students. The seminars encourage students to work together, creating meaning from the text and to stay away from trying to find a correct interpretation. The emphasis is on critical and creative thinking.

====Text selection====
=====Socratic seminar texts=====
A Socratic seminar text is a tangible document that creates a thought-provoking discussion.
The text ought to be appropriate for the participants&#x27; current level of intellectual and social development. It provides the anchor for dialogue whereby the facilitator can bring the participants back to the text if they begin to digress. Furthermore, the seminar text enables the participants to create a level playing field – ensuring that the dialogical tone within the classroom remains consistent and pure to the subject or topic at hand. Some practitioners argue that &quot;texts&quot; do not have to be confined to printed texts, but can include artifacts such as objects, physical spaces, and the like.

=====Pertinent elements of an effective Socratic text=====
Socratic seminar texts are able to challenge participants&#x27; thinking skills by having these characteristics:

# &quot;Ideas and values&quot;: The text must introduce ideas and values that are complex and difficult to summarize. Powerful discussions arise from personal connections to abstract ideas and from implications to personal values.
# &quot;Complexity and challenge&quot;: The text must be rich in ideas and complexity and open to interpretation. Ideally it should require multiple readings, but should be neither far above the participants&#x27; intellectual level nor very long.
# &quot;Relevance to participants&#x27; curriculum&quot;: An effective text has identifiable themes that are recognizable and pertinent to the lives of the participants. Themes in the text should relate to the curriculum.
# &quot;Ambiguity&quot;: The text must be approachable from a variety of different perspectives, including perspectives that seem mutually exclusive, thus provoking critical thinking and raising important questions. The absence of right and wrong answers promotes a variety of discussion and encourages individual contributions.

=====Two different ways to select a text=====
Socratic texts can be divided into two main categories:

# Print texts (e.g., short stories, poems, and essays) and non-print texts (e.g. photographs, sculptures, and maps); and
# Subject area, which can draw from print or non-print artifacts. As examples, language arts can be approached through poems, history through written or oral historical speeches, science through policies on environmental issues, math through mathematical proofs, health through nutrition labels, and physical education through fitness guidelines.

====Questioning methods====
Socratic seminars are based upon the interaction of peers. The focus is to explore multiple perspectives on a given issue or topic. Socratic questioning is used to help students apply the activity to their learning. The pedagogy of Socratic questions is open-ended, focusing on broad, general ideas rather than specific, factual information. The questioning technique emphasizes a level of questioning and thinking where there is no single right answer.

Socratic seminars generally start with an open-ended question proposed either by the leader or by another participant. There is no designated first speaker; as individuals participate in Socratic dialogue, they gain experience that enables them to be effective in this role of initial questioner.

The leader keeps the topic focused by asking a variety of questions about the text itself, as well as questions to help clarify positions when arguments become confused. The leader also seeks to coax reluctant participants into the discussion, and to limit contributions from those who tend to dominate. She or he prompts participants to elaborate on their responses and to build on what others have said. The leader guides participants to deepen, clarify, and paraphrase, and to synthesize a variety of different views.

The participants share the responsibility with the leader to maintain the quality of the Socratic circle. They listen actively to respond effectively to what others have contributed. This teaches the participants to think and speak persuasively using the discussion to support their position. Participants must demonstrate respect for different ideas, thoughts and values, and must not interrupt each other.

Questions can be created individually or in small groups. All participants are given the opportunity to take part in the discussion. Socratic circles specify three types of questions to prepare:

# Opening questions generate discussion at the beginning of the seminar in order to elicit dominant themes.
# Guiding questions help deepen and elaborate the discussion, keeping contributions on topic and encouraging a positive atmosphere and consideration for others.
# Closing questions lead participants to summarize their thoughts and learning and personalize what they&#x27;ve discussed.

=== Challenges and disadvantages ===
Scholars such as Peter Boghossian suggest that although the method improves creative and critical thinking, there is a flip side to the method. He states that the teachers who use this method wait for the students to make mistakes, thus creating negative feelings in the class, exposing the student to possible ridicule and humiliation.

Some have countered this thought by stating that the humiliation and ridicule is not caused by the method, rather it is due to the lack of knowledge of the student. Boghossian mentions that even though the questions may be perplexing, they are not originally meant for it, in fact such questions provoke the students and can be countered by employing counterexamples.

==Psychotherapy==
The Socratic method, in the form of Socratic questioning, has been adapted for psychotherapy, most prominently in classical Adlerian psychotherapy, logotherapy, rational emotive behavior therapy, cognitive therapy and reality therapy. It can be used to clarify meaning, feeling, and consequences, as well as to gradually unfold insight, or explore alternative actions.

The Socratic method has also recently inspired a new form of applied philosophy: Socratic dialogue, also called philosophical counseling. In Europe Gerd B. Achenbach is probably the best known practitioner, and Michel Weber has also proposed another variant of the practice.

<text>Kenneth Joseph Arrow (August 23, 1921 – February 21, 2017) was an American economist, mathematician and political theorist. He received the John Bates Clark Medal in 1957, and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1972, along with John Hicks.

In economics, Arrow was a major figure in postwar neoclassical economic theory. Four of his students (Roger Myerson, Eric Maskin, John Harsanyi, and Michael Spence) went on to become Nobel laureates themselves. His contributions to social choice theory, notably his &quot;impossibility theorem&quot;, and his work on general equilibrium analysis are significant. His work in many other areas of economics, including endogenous growth theory and the economics of information, was also foundational.

==Education and early career==
Arrow was born on August 23, 1921, in New York City. Arrow&#x27;s mother, Lilian (Greenberg), was from Iași, Romania, and his father, Harry Arrow, was from nearby Podu Iloaiei. The family was of Romanian-Jewish descent, and very supportive of Kenneth’s education. Growing up during the Great Depression, he embraced socialism in his youth. He would later move away from socialism, but his views retained a left-leaning philosophy.

He graduated from Townsend Harris High School and then earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics from the City College of New York in 1940, where he was a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon. He then attended Columbia University for graduate studies, obtaining a master&#x27;s degree in mathematics in June 1941. At Columbia, Arrow studied under Harold Hotelling, who influenced him to switch fields to economics. He served as a weather officer in the United States Army Air Forces from 1942 to 1946.

==Academic career==
From 1946 to 1949 Arrow was a graduate student at Columbia, and also worked as a research associate at the Cowles Commission. During that time he also was an assistant professor of economics at the University of Chicago and worked at the RAND Corporation in California. He left Chicago to become an acting assistant professor of economics and statistics at Stanford University. In 1951, he earned his PhD from Columbia. He served in the government on the staff of the Council of Economic Advisers in the 1960s with Robert Solow. In 1968, he left Stanford for Harvard University, where he was appointed Professor of Economics; it was during his tenure there that he received the Nobel Prize in Economics.

Arrow returned to Stanford in 1979 and became the Joan Kenney Professor of Economics and Professor of Operations Research. He retired in 1991. As a Fulbright Distinguished Chair, in 1995 he taught economics at the University of Siena. He was also a founding member of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences and a member of the board at the Santa Fe Institute. At various stages in his career he was a Fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge.
He was one of the founding editors of the &quot;Annual Review of Economics&quot;, which was first published in 2009.

Four of his former students have gone on to become Nobel Prize winners, namely John Harsanyi, Eric Maskin, Roger Myerson, and Michael Spence.
A collection of Arrow&#x27;s papers is housed at the Rubenstein Library at Duke University.

===Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem===

Arrow&#x27;s monograph &quot;Social Choice and Individual Values&quot; derives from his 1951 PhD thesis.

In what he named the General Impossibility Theorem, he theorized that, unless we accept to compare the levels of utility reached by different individuals, it is impossible to formulate a social preference ordering that satisfies all of the following conditions:

# Nondictatorship: The preferences of an individual should not become the group ranking without considering the preferences of others.
# Individual Sovereignty: each individual should be able to order the choices in any way and indicate ties
# Unanimity: If every individual prefers one choice to another, then the group ranking should do the same
# Freedom From Irrelevant Alternatives: If a choice is removed, then the others&#x27; order should not change
# Uniqueness of Group Rank: The method should yield the same result whenever applied to a set of preferences. The group ranking should be transitive.

The theorem has implications for welfare economics and theories of justice, and for voting theory (it extends the Condorcet paradox). Following Arrow&#x27;s logical framework, Amartya Sen formulated the liberal paradox which argued that given a status of &quot;Minimal Liberty&quot; there was no way to obtain Pareto optimality, nor to avoid the problem of social choice of neutral but unequal results.

===General equilibrium theory===

Work by Arrow and Gérard Debreu and simultaneous work by Lionel McKenzie offered the first rigorous proofs of the existence of a market clearing equilibrium. For this work and his other contributions, Debreu won the 1983 Nobel Prize in Economics. Arrow went on to extend the model and its analysis to include uncertainty, the stability. His contributions to the general equilibrium theory were influenced by Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot;. Written in 1776, &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; is an examination of economic growth brought forward by the division of labor, by ensuring interdependence of individuals within society.

In 1974, The American Economic Association published the paper written by Kenneth Arrow, &quot;General Economic Equilibrium: Purpose, Analytic Techniques, Collective Choice&quot;, where he states:

===Fundamental theorems of welfare economics===
In 1951, Arrow presented the first and second fundamental theorems of welfare economics and their proofs without requiring differentiability of utility, consumption, or technology, and including corner solutions.

===Endogenous-growth theory===

Arrow was one of the precursors of endogenous growth theory, which seeks to explain the source of technical change, which is a key driver of economic growth. Until this theory came to prominence, technical change was assumed to occur exogenously—that is, it was assumed to occur outside economic activities, and was outside (exogenous) to common economic models. At the same time there was no economic explanation for &quot;why&quot; it occurred. Endogenous-growth theory provided standard economic reasons for why firms innovate, leading economists to think of innovation and technical change as determined by economic actors, that is endogenously to economic activities, and thus belong inside the model. Endogenous growth theory started with Paul Romer&#x27;s 1986 paper, borrowing from Arrow&#x27;s 1962 &quot;learning-by-doing&quot; model which introduced a mechanism to eliminate diminishing returns in aggregate output. A literature on this theory has developed subsequently to Arrow&#x27;s work.

===Information economics===
In other pioneering research, Arrow investigated the problems caused by asymmetric information in markets. In many transactions, one party (usually the seller) has more information about the product being sold than the other party. Asymmetric information creates incentives for the party with more information to cheat the party with less information; as a result, a number of market structures have developed, including warranties and third party authentication, which enable markets with asymmetric information to function. Arrow analysed this issue for medical care (a 1963 paper entitled &quot;Uncertainty and the Welfare Economics of Medical Care&quot;, in the American Economic Review); later researchers investigated many other markets, particularly second-hand assets, online auctions and insurance.

==Awards and honors==
Arrow was awarded the John Bates Clark Medal in 1957 and was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1959. In 1968, he was elected to both the United States National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. He was the joint winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics with John Hicks in 1972 and the 1986 recipient of the von Neumann Theory Prize. He was one of the recipients of the 2004 National Medal of Science, the nation&#x27;s highest scientific honor, presented by President George W. Bush for his contributions to research on the problem of making decisions using imperfect information and his research on bearing risk.

He has received honorary doctorates from the University of Chicago (1967), the University of Vienna (1971) the City University of New York (1972). On 2 June 1995 he received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Social Sciences at Uppsala University, Sweden. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2006.
He was elected to the 2002 class of Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences. In 2007 he was the first Witten Lecturer at the Witten/Herdecke University as the awardee of the Witten Lectures in Economics and Philosophy.

==Personal life and death==
Arrow was a brother to the economist Anita Summers, uncle to economist and former Treasury Secretary and Harvard President Larry Summers, and brother-in-law of the late economists Robert Summers and Paul Samuelson. In 1947, he married Selma Schweitzer, graduate in economics at the University of Chicago and psychotherapist, who died in 2015; they had two children, David Michael (b. 1962), an actor, and Andrew Seth (b. 1965), an actor/singer.

Arrow was well known for being a polymath, possessing prodigious knowledge of subjects far removed from economics. On one occasion (recounted by Eric Maskin), in an attempt to artificially test Arrow&#x27;s knowledge, the junior faculty agreed to closely study the breeding habits of gray whales—a suitably obscure topic—and discuss it in his presence. To their surprise, Arrow already was familiar with the work they had studied and, in addition, thought it had been refuted by other research.

Arrow died in his Palo Alto, California, home on February 21, 2017, at the age of 95.

<doc id="49895" wikidata="Q1411871" url="?curid=49895" title="Piety">
<text>Piety is a virtue which may include religious devotion or spirituality. A common element in most conceptions of piety is a duty of respect. In a religious context, piety may be expressed through pious activities or devotions, which may vary among countries and cultures.

== Etymology ==
The word piety comes from the Latin word , the noun form of the adjective (which means &quot;devout&quot; or &quot;dutiful&quot;). English literature scholar Alan Jacobs has written about the origins and early meaning of the term:
==Classical interpretation==
 in traditional Latin usage expressed a complex, highly valued Roman virtue; a man with respected his responsibilities to gods, country, parents, and kin. In its strictest sense it was the sort of love a son ought to have for his father. Aeneas&#x27;s consistent epithet in Virgil and other Latin authors is , a term which connotes reverence toward the gods and familial dutifulness. At the fall of Troy, Aeneas carries to safety his father, the lame Anchises, and the Lares and Penates, the statues of the household gods.

In addressing whether children have an obligation to provide support for their parents, Aquinas quotes, Cicero, &quot;...piety gives both duty and homage&quot;: &quot;duty&quot; referring to service, and &quot;homage&quot; to reverence or honor.&quot; Filial piety is central to Confucian ethics; reverence for parents is considered in Chinese ethics the prime virtue and the basis of all right human relations.

==As a virtue==
In Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Lutheranism, and Anglicanism, piety is one of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit. &quot;It engenders in the soul a filial respect for God, a generous love toward him, and an affectionate obedience that wants to do what he commands because it loves the one who commands.&quot; Pope Gregory I, in demonstrating the interrelationship among the gifts, said &quot;Through the fear of the Lord, we rise to piety, from piety then to knowledge...&quot;

Aquinas spoke of piety in the context of one&#x27;s parents and country, and given the obligation to accord each what is rightfully due them, related it to the cardinal virtue of justice. (By analogy, rendering to God what is due him, Aquinas identified as the virtue of religion, also related to justice.) Professor Richard McBrien said piety &quot;is a gift of the Holy Spirit by which we are motivated and enabled to be faithful and respectful to those—ultimately, God—who have had a positive, formative influence on our lives and to whom we owe a debt of gratitude,&quot; and requires one to acknowledge, to the extent possible, the sources of those many blessings through words and gestures great and small.

Piety belongs to the virtue of Religion, which theologians put among the moral virtues, as a part of the cardinal virtue Justice, since by it one tenders to God what is due to him. The gift of piety perfects the virtue of justice, enabling the individual to fulfill his obligations to God and neighbor, and to do so willingly and joyfully. By inspiring a person with a tender and filial confidence in God, the gift of piety makes them joyfully embrace all that pertains to His service.

John Calvin said, &quot;I call ‘piety’ that reverence joined with love of God which the knowledge of his benefits induces. For until [people] recognize that they owe everything to God, that they are nourished by his fatherly care, that he is the Author of their every good, that they should seek nothing beyond him—they will never yield him willing service.&quot; Bishop Pierre Whalon says that &quot;Piety, therefore, is the pursuit of an ever-greater sense of being in the presence of God.&quot;

The Gift of Piety is synonymous with of filial trust in God. Through piety, a person shows reverence for God as a loving Father, and respect for others as children of God.

Pope John Paul II defined piety as &quot;the gift of reverence for what comes from God,&quot; and related it to his earlier lectures on the Theology of the Body. In a General Audience in June 2014, Pope Francis said, &quot;When the Holy Spirit helps us sense the presence of the Lord and all of his love for us, it warms our heart and drives us almost naturally to prayer and celebration.&quot; &quot;Piety&quot;, said Pope Francis, points up &quot;our friendship with God.&quot; It is a gift that enables people to serve their neighbor &quot;with gentleness and with a smile.&quot;

==Piety and devotion ==

Expressions of piety vary according to country and local tradition. &quot;Feast days&quot;, with their preparations for various religious celebrations and activities, have forged traditions peculiar to communities. Many pious exercises are part of the cultic patrimony of particular Churches or religious families. Devotions help incorporate faith into daily life.

While acknowledging that Anglican piety took the forms of more frequent communion and liturgical observances and customs, Bishop Ronald Williams spoke for increased reading of the Bible.

In the Methodist Church, works of piety are a means of grace. They can be personal, such as reading, prayer, and meditation; or communal, such as sharing in the sacraments or Bible study. For Presbyterians, piety refers to a whole realm of practices—such as worship, prayer, singing, and service—that help shape and guide the way one&#x27;s reverence and love for God are expressed; and &quot;the duty of the Christian to live a life of piety in accordance with God’s moral law&quot;.

The veneration of sacred images belongs to the nature of Catholic piety, with the understanding that &quot;the honour rendered to the image is directed to the person represented&quot;.

<text>Courage (also called bravery, valour (British and Commonwealth English), or valor (American English)) is the choice and willingness to confront agony, pain, danger, uncertainty, or intimidation. Valor is courage or bravery, especially in battle.

Physical courage is bravery in the face of physical pain, hardship, even death, or threat of death; while moral courage is the ability to act rightly in the face of popular opposition, shame, scandal, discouragement, or personal loss.

The classical virtue of fortitude (, ) is also translated as &quot;courage&quot;, but includes the aspects of perseverance and patience. In the Western tradition, notable thoughts on courage have come from philosophers Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, and Kierkegaard; as well as Christian beliefs and texts.

In the Hindu tradition, mythology has given many examples of courage; with examples of both physical and moral courage exemplified. In the Eastern tradition, the Chinese text &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; offers a great deal of thoughts on courage; both physical and moral.

==Characteristics of courage==
===Fear and confidence in relation to courage===
According to Professor Daniel Putman, &quot;courage involves deliberate choice in the face of painful or fearful circumstances for the sake of a worthy goal&quot;. With this realization, Putman concludes that &quot;there is a close connection between fear and confidence&quot;.
Fear and confidence in relation to courage can determine the success of a courageous act or goal. They can be seen as independent variables in courage, and their relationship can affect how we respond to fear. The confidence that is being discussed here is self-confidence; confidence in knowing one&#x27;s skills and abilities and being able to determine when to fight fear or when to flee it. Putman states that: &quot;The ideal in courage is not just a rigid control of fear, nor is it a denial of the emotion. The ideal is to judge a situation, accept the emotion as part of human nature and, we hope, use well-developed habits to confront the fear and allow reason to guide our behavior toward a worthwhile goal.&quot;

According to Putman, Aristotle refers to an appropriate level of fear and confidence in courage. &quot;Fear, although it might vary from person to person, is not completely relative and is only appropriate if it &#x27;matches the danger of the situation&#x27;&quot;. The same goes for confidence in that there are two aspects to self-confidence in a dangerous situation:
# &quot;A realistic confidence in the worth of a cause that motivates positive action.&quot;
# &quot;Knowing our own skills and abilities. A second meaning of appropriate confidence then is a form of self-knowledge.&quot;

Without an appropriate balance between fear and confidence when facing a threat, one cannot have the courage to overcome it. Professor Daniel Putman states &quot;if the two emotions are distinct, then excesses or deficiencies in either fear or confidence can distort courage&quot;. Courage does not mean that you are not afraid, it means that you are willing to face the challenges that lay ahead of you.

===Possible distortions of courage===
According to Putman, there are four possible ways courage could be distorted:
#&quot;Higher level of fear than a situation calls for, low level of confidence&quot;. Someone like this would be perceived as a coward;
#&quot;Excessively low level of fear when real fear is an appropriate, excessively high level of confidence&quot;. Someone like this would be perceived as foolhardy;
#&quot;Excessively high level of fear, yet the confidence is also excessively high&quot;. The third possibility can occur if someone experienced a traumatic experience that brought about great anxiety for much of their life. Then they fear that their experience would often be inappropriate and excessive. Yet as a defensive mechanism, the person would show excessive levels of confidence as a way to confront their irrational fear and &quot;prove&quot; something to oneself or another. So this distortion could be seen as a coping method for their fear.
#&quot;Excessively low level of fear and low level of confidence&quot;. For the last possibility, it can be seen as hopelessness or fatalism.

Thus, Putman identifies fear and courage as being deeply intertwined and that they rely on distinct perceptions: &quot;the danger of the situation&quot;, &quot;the worthiness of the cause&quot;, &quot;and the perception of one&#x27;s ability&quot;.

==Theories==
=== Ancient Greece ===

Plato&#x27;s &quot;Laches&quot; discusses courage, but fails to come to a satisfactory conclusion on what courage is. Many definitions of courage are offered, including:

While many definitions are given in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Laches&quot;, all are refuted, giving the reader a sense of Plato&#x27;s argument style. &quot;Laches&quot; is an early writing of Plato&#x27;s, which may be a reason he does not come to a clear conclusion. In this early writing, Plato is still developing his ideas and shows influence from his teachers like Socrates.

In &quot;The Republic&quot;, Plato describes courage as a sort of perseverance – &quot;preservation of the belief that has been inculcated by the law through education about what things and sorts of things are to be feared&quot;. Plato explains this perseverance as being able to persevere through all emotions, like suffering, pleasure, and fear.

As a desirable quality, courage is discussed broadly by Aristotle in the context of soldiers in battle for a noble cause. In &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;, where its absence is the vice of cowardice and its excess the vice of recklessness, courage represents the mean between the two extremes.

Thucydides, a Greek historian, wrote, &quot;The bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of what is before them, glory and danger alike, and yet notwithstanding, go out to meet it.&quot;

=== Ancient Rome ===
In the Roman Empire, courage formed part of the universal virtue of . Roman philosopher and statesman Cicero () lists the cardinal virtues but does not name them as such: &quot;Virtue may be defined as a habit of mind () in harmony with reason and the order of nature. It has four parts: wisdom (), justice, courage, temperance.&quot; However, Cicero held that &quot;a courageous spirit in a human who has not attained perfection and ideal wisdom is generally too impetuous&quot;.

=== Western traditions ===
In &quot;De Officiis Ministrorum&quot;, Ambrose echoes Cicero in holding reservations regarding those who exhibit courage without yet having demonstrated a general moral balance. Ambrose held that fortitude without justice occasions injustice; since the stronger a man is the more ready to oppress the weaker.

Courage is a natural virtue which Saint Augustine did not consider a virtue for Christians.

===Eastern traditions===
The &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; contends that courage is derived from love () translated as: &quot;From love one gains courage.&quot;

In Hindu tradition, Courage () / Bravery (), and Patience () appear as the first two of ten characteristics () of in the Hindu &quot;Manusmṛti&quot;, alongside forgiveness (), tolerance (), honesty (), physical restraint (), cleanliness (), perceptiveness (), knowledge (), truthfulness (), and control of anger ().

Islamic beliefs also present courage and self-control as a key factors in facing the Devil (both internally and externally). Many have this belief because of the courage the Prophets of the past displayed (through peace and patience), despite there being people who despised them.

===Modern===
====Pre-19th century====
Thomas Hobbes lists virtues into the categories of moral virtues and virtues of men in his work &quot;Man and Citizen&quot;. Hobbes outlines moral virtues as virtues in citizens, that is virtues that without exception are beneficial to society as a whole. These moral virtues are justice (i.e. not violating the law) and charity. Courage as well as prudence and temperance are listed as the virtues of men. By this Hobbes means that these virtues are invested solely in the private good as opposed to the public good of justice and charity. Hobbes describes courage and prudence as strengths of mind as opposed to a goodness of manners. These virtues are always meant to act in the interests of individual while the positive and/or negative effects of society are merely a byproduct. This stems forth from the idea put forth in &quot;Leviathan&quot; that the state of nature is &quot;solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short&quot; and self-preservation is the most fundamental aspect of behavior. According to Hobbes courage is a virtue of the individual in order to ensure a better chance of survival while the moral virtues address Hobbes&#x27;s social contract which civilized men display (in varying degrees) in order to transcend the state of nature. Hobbes also uses the idea of fortitude as a virtue. Fortitude is &quot;to dare&quot; according to Hobbes, but also to &quot;resist stoutly in present dangers&quot;. This is a more in-depth elaboration of Hobbes&#x27;s concept of courage that is addressed earlier in .

David Hume listed virtues into two categories in his work &quot;A Treatise of Human Nature&quot;: artificial virtues and natural virtues. Hume categorized courage as a natural virtue. In the &quot;Treatise&quot;&#x27;s section &quot;Of Pride and Humility, Their Objects and Causes&quot;, Hume wrote that courage is a cause of pride: &quot;Every valuable quality of the mind, whether of the imagination, judgment, memory or disposition; wit, good-sense, learning, courage, justice, integrity; all these are the cause of pride; and their opposites of humility&quot;. 

Hume also wrote that courage and joy have positive effects on the soul: &quot;...since the soul, when elevated with joy and courage, in a manner seeks opposition, and throws itself with alacrity into any scene of thought or action, where its courage meets with matter to nourish and employ it&quot;. Along with courage nourishing and employing, Hume also wrote that courage defends humans in the &quot;Treatise&quot;: &quot;We easily gain from the liberality of others, but are always in danger of losing by their avarice: Courage defends us, but cowardice lays us open to every attack&quot;.

Hume considered what excessive courage does to a hero&#x27;s character in the &quot;Treatise&quot;&#x27;s section &quot;Of the Other Virtues and Vices&quot;: &quot;Accordingly we may observe, that an excessive courage and magnanimity, especially when it displays itself under the frowns of fortune, contributes in a great measure, to the character of a hero, and will render a person the admiration of posterity; at the same time, that it ruins his affairs, and leads him into dangers and difficulties, with which otherwise he would never have been acquainted&quot;.

Other understandings of courage that Hume offered can be derived from Hume&#x27;s views on morals, reason, sentiment, and virtue from his work &quot;An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals.&quot;

====19th century onward====

Søren Kierkegaard opposed courage to angst, while Paul Tillich opposed an existential &quot;courage to be&quot; with non-being, fundamentally equating it with religion:
J.R.R. Tolkien identified in his 1936 lecture &quot;&quot; a &quot;Northern &#x27;theory of courage&#x27;&quot; – the heroic or &quot;virtuous pagan&quot; insistence to do the right thing even in the face of certain defeat without promise of reward or salvation:
Virtuous pagan heroism or courage in this sense is &quot;trusting in your own strength&quot;, as observed by Jacob Grimm in his &quot;Teutonic Mythology&quot;:

Ernest Hemingway famously defined courage as &quot;grace under pressure&quot;.

Winston Churchill stated, &quot;Courage is rightly esteemed the first of human qualities because it is the quality that guarantees all others.&quot;

According to Maya Angelou, &quot;Courage is the most important of the virtues, because without courage you can&#x27;t practice any other virtue consistently. You can practice any virtue erratically, but nothing consistently without courage.&quot; And C.S. Lewis wrote that &quot;Courage is not simply one of the virtues but the form of every virtue at the testing point, which means at the point of highest reality.&quot;

In &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot;, Friedrich Nietzsche describes master–slave morality, in which a noble man regards himself as a &quot;determiner of values&quot;; one who does not require approval, but passes judgment. Later, in the same text, he lists man&#x27;s four virtues as courage, insight, sympathy, and solitude, and goes on to emphasize the importance of courage: &quot;The great epochs of our life are the occasions when we gain the courage to re-baptize our evil qualities as our best qualities.&quot;

According to the Swiss psychologist Andreas Dick, courage consists of the following components:

# put at risk, risk or repugnance, or sacrifice safety or convenience, which may result in death, bodily harm, social condemnation or emotional deprivation;
# a knowledge of wisdom and prudence about what is right and wrong in a given moment;
# Hope and confidence in a happy, meaningful outcome;
# a free will;
# a motive based on love.

===Implicit Theories of Courage===
Researchers who want to study the concept and the emotion of courage have continued to come across a certain problem. While there are &quot;numerous definitions of courage&quot;, they are unable to set &quot;an operational definition of courage on which to base sound explicit theories&quot;. Rate &quot;et al.&quot; states that because of a lack of an operational definition, the advancement of research in courage is limited. So they conducted studies to try to find &quot;a common structure of courage&quot;. Their goal from their research of implicit theories was to find &quot;people&#x27;s form and content on the idea of courage&quot;. Many researchers created studies on implicit theories by creating a questionnaire that would ask &quot;What is courage?&quot;. In addition, in order to develop a measurement scale of courage, ten experts in the field of psychology came together to define courage. They defined it as:
Also, because courage is a multi-dimensional construct, it can be &quot;better understood as an exceptional response to specific external conditions or circumstances than as an attribute, disposition, or character trait&quot;. Meaning that rather than being or an attribute, courage is a response to fear.

From their research, they were able to find the &quot;four necessary components of people&#x27;s notion of courage&quot;. They are:
#&quot;intentionality/deliberation&quot;
#&quot;personal fear&quot;
#&quot;noble/good act&quot;
#&quot;and personal risk&quot;

With these four components, they were able to define courage as:
To further the discussion of the implicit theories of courage, the researchers stated that future research could consider looking into the concept of courage and fear and how individual&#x27;s might feel fear, overcome it and act, and act despite it.

=== &quot;Clinical courage&quot; ===

The term &quot;clinical courage&quot; came to light in relation to modern medicine in the 2000s, mostly in relation to the practice of medicine in remote or resource-limited settings. It has been described as the practice of medicine outside of a clinician&#x27;s usual scope of practice, or relevant clinical guidelines, in order to provide essential medical care, where no alternative exists. It has been specifically discussed in relation to rural generalists, paramedics, general practitioners, and rural medicine. The opposing theory is that of &quot;clinical recklessness&quot;, in which the actions of a clinician in stepping outside of their competence results in unprofessional behaviour, which exposes patients to risk or harm.

== Society and symbolism ==
One symbol often associated with courage is the lion. It is sometimes seen in the Catholic Church as a depiction of Christ&#x27;s triumph over sin. It also is a symbol in some cultures as a savior of the people who live in a community with sin and corruption.

==Fortitude==

Fortitude and courage are distinguishable in that fortitude is the mental or emotional strength that enables courage in the face of adversity. According to Presbyterian theologian William Swan Plumer, &quot;There is also, in strict propriety of language, a difference between courage and fortitude. Courage faces and resists danger; fortitude endures pain... Courage is for action; fortitude for suffering. In this sense, fortitude differs little from constancy and patient endurance.&quot;

Thomas Aquinas says that fortitude ranks third after prudence and justice among the cardinal virtues. He distinguishes fortitude from fearlessness, which can too easily become recklessness through short-sighted audacity with disastrous results. In both Catholicism and Anglicanism, fortitude is also one of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit.

==Awards==
Several awards claim to recognize courageous actions, including:

* The Victoria Cross (VC) is the highest military award that may be received by members of the British Armed Forces and the Armed Forces of other Commonwealth countries for valour &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot;, the civilian equivalent being the George Cross. A total of 1,356 VCs have been awarded to individuals, 13 since World War II.
* The Medal of Honor is the highest military decoration awarded by the United States government. It is bestowed on members of the United States armed forces who distinguish themselves &quot;conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States&quot;.
* The military crosses of the various branches of the United States armed forcesArmy Distinguished Service Cross, Navy Cross, Air Force Cross and Coast Guard Crossare the second highest military decoration that can be awarded to a member of those branches, awarded for extreme gallantry and risk of life in actual combat with an armed enemy force. Despite their branch related names, an action by any person, from any branch, in support of a branch other than their own, can result in that person being awarded a military cross by, and of, that other branch.
* The Carnegie Hero Fund – was established to recognize persons who perform extraordinary acts of heroism in civilian life in the United States and Canada, and to provide financial assistance for those disabled and the dependents of those killed saving or attempting to save others.
* The Profile in Courage Award is a private award given to people who display courage in a similar way to those John F. Kennedy described in his book &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot;. It is given to individuals (often elected officials) who, by acting in accord with their conscience, risked their careers or lives by pursuing a larger vision of the national, state, or local interest in opposition to popular opinion or pressure from constituents or other local interests.
* The Civil Courage Prize is a human rights award which is awarded to &quot;steadfast resistance to evil at great personal risk – rather than military valor&quot;. It is awarded by the Trustees of The Train Foundation annually and may be awarded posthumously.
* Courage to Care Award is a plaque with miniature bas-reliefs depicting the backdrop for the rescuers&#x27; exceptional deeds during the Nazis&#x27; persecution, deportation, and murder of millions of Jews.
* The Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage is awarded by Georgia Institute of Technology to individuals who uphold the legacy of former Atlanta Mayor Ivan Allen Jr., whose actions in Atlanta, Georgia, and testimony before congress in support of the 1963 Civil Rights Bill legislation set a standard for courage during the turbulent civil rights era of the 1960s.
* The Param Vir Chakra is the highest military award in India given to those who show the highest degree of valour or self-sacrifice in the presence of the enemy. It can be, and often has been, awarded posthumously.
* The Military Order of Maria Theresa, the highest order of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, was awarded for &quot;successful military acts of essential impact to a campaign that were undertaken on [an officer&#x27;s] own initiative, and might have been omitted by an honorable officer without reproach&quot;.
* The Edelstam Prize is awarded for outstanding contributions and exceptional courage in standing up for one&#x27;s beliefs in the defense of Human Rights. This award is given to those who had the ability to act in complex situations to either save human lives or defend those who are threatened.

<text>A virtue () is a trait of excellence, including traits that may be moral, social, or intellectual. The cultivation and refinement of virtue is held to be the &quot;good of humanity&quot; and thus is valued as an end purpose of life or a foundational principle of being. In human practical ethics, a virtue is a disposition to choose actions that succeed in showing high moral standards: doing what is said to be right and avoiding what is wrong in a given field of endeavour, even when doing so may be unnecessary from a utilitarian perspective. When someone takes pleasure in doing what is right, even when it is difficult or initially unpleasant, they can establish virtue as a habit. Such a person is said to be virtuous through having cultivated such a disposition. The opposite of virtue is vice.

Other examples of this notion include the concept of merit in Asian traditions as well as (Chinese ).

==Etymology==
The ancient Romans used the Latin word (derived from , their word for &quot;man&quot;) to refer to all of the &quot;excellent qualities of men, including physical strength, valorous conduct, and moral rectitude&quot;. The French words and came from this Latin root. The word &quot;virtue&quot; &quot;was borrowed into English in the 13th century&quot;.

==History==

===Ancient Egypt===

Maat (or Ma&#x27;at) was the ancient Egyptian goddess of truth, balance, order, law, morality, and justice. The word was also used to refer to these concepts. Maat was also portrayed as regulating the stars, seasons, and the actions of both mortals and the deities. The deities set the order of the universe from chaos at the moment of creation. Her (ideological) counterpart was Isfet, who symbolized chaos, lies, and injustice.

===Greco-Roman antiquity===

===Platonic virtue===
The four classic cardinal virtues are:
* Prudence (, ; ; also Wisdom, , ), the ability to discern the appropriate course of action to be taken in a given situation at the appropriate time.
* Fortitude (, ; ): also termed courage, forbearance, strength, endurance, and the ability to confront fear, uncertainty, and intimidation.
* Temperance (, ; ): also known as restraint, the practice of self-control, abstention, discretion, and moderation tempering the appetition. Plato considered , which may also be translated as sound-mindedness, to be the most important virtue.
* Justice (, ; ): also considered as fairness; the Greek word also having the meaning of righteousness.

This enumeration is traced to Greek philosophy and was listed by Plato who also added piety (, ) and replaced prudence with wisdom. Some scholars consider either of the above four virtue combinations as mutually reducible and therefore not cardinal.

It is unclear whether Plato subscribed to a unified view of virtues. In &quot;Protagoras&quot; and &quot;Meno&quot; he states that the separate virtues cannot exist independently and offers as evidence the contradictions of acting with wisdom, yet in an unjust way; or acting with bravery (fortitude), yet without wisdom. The narrative in the &quot;Meno&quot; commences with the eponymous character asking about virtue, but when Socrates asks him &quot;What is virtue?&quot;, he replies with a list of virtues displayed in different ways.

==== Aristotelian virtue ====

In his &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;, Aristotle defined a virtue as a point between a deficiency and an excess of a trait. The point of greatest virtue lies not in the exact middle, but at a golden mean sometimes closer to one extreme than the other. This golden mean obtains at a desirable middle between excess and deficiency. For Aristotle, the desirableness of the trait at the golden mean—that which makes it a virtue—consists in its disposition to be &quot;chosen under the proper guidance of reason.&quot; That is, in its disposition to foster human flourishing, a state defined with respect to human nature conceived teleologically, or as an end to be realized instead of a descriptive fact to be understood.

However, the virtuous action is not simply the &quot;mean&quot; (mathematically speaking) between two opposite extremes. As Aristotle says in the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;: &quot;at the right times, and on the right occasions, and towards the right persons, and with the right object, and in the right fashion, is the mean course and the best course, and these are characteristics of virtue.&quot; For example, generosity is a virtue between the two extremes of miserliness and being profligate. Further examples include courage between cowardice and foolhardiness and confidence between self-deprecation and conceit. In Aristotle&#x27;s sense, a virtue is an excellence at being human.

===== Intellectual virtues =====
Aristotle also identifies the &quot;intellectual virtues&quot; of knowledge, art, practical judgement, intuition, and wisdom.

====Roman virtues====
The term &quot;virtue&quot; itself is derived from the Latin &quot;&quot; (the personification of which was the deity Virtus), and had connotations of &quot;manliness&quot;, &quot;honour&quot;, worthiness of deferential respect, and civic duty as both citizen and soldier. This virtue was but one of many virtues which Romans of good character were expected to exemplify and pass on through the generations, as part of the ; ancestral traditions which defined &quot;Roman-ness&quot;. Romans distinguished between the spheres of private and public life, and thus, virtues were also divided between those considered to be in the realm of private family life (as lived and taught by the paterfamilias) and those expected of an upstanding Roman citizen.

Most Roman concepts of virtue were also personified as a numinous deity. The primary Roman virtues, both public and private, were:
===Ancient India===

While religious scriptures generally consider or (the Tamil term for virtue) as a divine virtue, Valluvar describes it as a way of life rather than any spiritual observance, a way of harmonious living that leads to universal happiness. For this reason, Valluvar keeps as the cornerstone throughout the writing of the Kural literature. Valluvar considered justice as a facet or product of . While many before his time opined that justice cannot be defined and that it was a divine mystery, Valluvar suggested that a divine origin is not required to define the concept of justice. In the words of V. R. Nedunchezhiyan, justice according to Valluvar &quot;dwells in the minds of those who have knowledge of the standard of right and wrong; so too deceit dwells in the minds which breed fraud.&quot;

===Chivalric virtues in medieval Europe===

In the , upon the occasion of his coronation as Holy Roman Emperor, Charlemagne published a list of knightly virtues:
* Love God
* Love your neighbor
* Give alms to the poor
* Entertain strangers
* Visit the sick
* Be merciful to prisoners
* Do ill to no man, nor consent unto such
* Forgive as ye hope to be forgiven
* Redeem the captive
* Help the oppressed
* Defend the cause of the widow and orphan
* Render righteous judgement
* Do not consent to any wrong
* Persevere not in wrath
* Shun excess in eating and drinking
* Be humble and kind
* Serve your liege lord faithfully
* Do not steal
* Do not perjure yourself, nor let others do so
* Envy, hatred, and violence separate men from the Kingdom of God
* Defend the Church and promote her cause.

== Religious traditions ==
===Abrahamic religions===
====Bahá&#x27;í Faith====

The Baháʼí teachings speak of a &quot;Greater Covenant&quot;, being universal and endless, and a &quot;Lesser Covenant&quot; specific to each religion. Baháʼís view Baháʼu&#x27;lláh&#x27;s revelation as a binding lesser covenant for his followers. In the Baháʼí writings being firm in the covenant is considered a virtue.

====Christianity====

In Christianity, the three theological virtues are faith, hope, and love, a list which comes from ( (faith), (hope), (love), ). The same chapter describes love as the greatest of the three, and further defines love as &quot;patient... kind... not envious, or boastful, or arrogant, or rude.&quot; (The Christian virtue of love is sometimes called charity and at other times a Greek word is used to contrast the love of God and the love of humankind from other types of love such as friendship or physical affection.)

Christian scholars frequently add the four classic cardinal virtues (prudence, justice, temperance, and courage) to the theological virtues to give the seven heavenly virtues; for example, these seven are the ones described in the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;, sections 1803–1829. In Christian tradition courage or fortitude is a gift of the Holy Spirit. 

In , Aurelius Prudentius Clemens listed seven &quot;heavenly virtues&quot; in his book &quot;Psychomachia&quot; (&quot;Battle of Souls&quot;) which is an allegorical story of conflict between vices and virtues. Among the virtues were (faith), (chastity), (endurance), (humility), (hope), (sobriety), (reason), (devotion), (peace), (harmony), and (wisdom).

The medieval and renaissance periods saw a number of models of sin, listing the seven deadly sins and the seven capital virtues opposed to each.
====Islam====

In Islam, the Quran is believed to be the literal word of God, and the definitive description of virtue, and Muhammad is considered an ideal example of virtue in human form. The foundation of Islamic understanding of virtue was the understanding and interpretation of the Quran and the practices of Muhammad. Virtue is seen in the context of active submission to God performed by the community in unison.

Believers are to &quot;enjoin that which is virtuous and forbid that which is vicious&quot; () in all spheres of life (Quran 3:110). Muslims teach that mankind has been granted the faculty to discern God&#x27;s will and to abide by it.

Later Muslim scholars expanded the religious ethics of the scriptures in detail.

In the Hadith (Islamic traditions), it is reported by An-Nawwas bin Sam&#x27;an:
Wabisah bin Ma&#x27;bad reported:
Virtue, as seen in opposition to sin, is termed (spiritual merit or reward) but there are other Islamic terms to describe virtue such as (&quot;bounty&quot;), (&quot;piety&quot;), and (&quot;righteousness&quot;). According to Muslim beliefs, God will forgive individual sins but the bad treatment of people and injustice toward others can only be pardoned by the victims and not by God.

====Judaism====

Loving God and obeying his laws, in particular the Ten Commandments, are central to Jewish conceptions of virtue. Wisdom is personified in the first eight chapters of the Book of Proverbs and is not only the source of virtue but is depicted as the first and best creation of God ().

A classic articulation of the Golden Rule came from the first century Rabbi Hillel the Elder. Renowned in the Jewish tradition, he is associated with the development of the Mishnah and the Talmud and, as such, is one of the most important figures in Jewish history. Asked for a summary of the Jewish religion in the most concise terms, Hillel replied (reputedly while standing on one leg): &quot;That which is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow. That is the whole Torah. The rest is commentary; go and learn.&quot;

===Eastern religions===
====Buddhism====
Buddhist practice as outlined in the Noble Eightfold Path can be regarded as a progressive list of virtues.
# Right View – realizing the Four Noble Truths (, ).
# Right Mindfulness – mental ability to see things for what they are with clear consciousness (, ).
# Right Concentration – wholesome one-pointedness of mind (, ).

Buddhism&#x27;s four (&quot;Divine States&quot;) can be more properly regarded as virtues in the European sense. They are:
# /: loving-kindness towards all; the hope that a person will be well; loving kindness is the wish that all sentient beings, without any exception, be happy.
# : compassion; the hope that a person&#x27;s sufferings will diminish; compassion is the wish for all sentient beings to be free from suffering.
# : altruistic joy in the accomplishments of a person, oneself or other; sympathetic joy is the wholesome attitude of rejoicing in the happiness and virtues of all sentient beings.
# /: equanimity, or learning to accept both loss and gain, praise and blame, success and failure with detachment, equally, for oneself and for others. Equanimity means not to distinguish between friend, enemy or stranger, but to regard every sentient being as equal. It is a clear-minded tranquil state of mind – not being overpowered by delusions, mental dullness, or agitation.

There are also the (&quot;perfections&quot;), which are the culmination of having acquired certain virtues. In Theravada Buddhism&#x27;s canonical &quot;Buddhavaṃsa&quot; there are Ten Perfections (). In Mahayana Buddhism, the Lotus Sutra (&quot;Saddharmapundarika&quot;), there are Six Perfections; while in the Ten Stages (&quot;Dasabhumika&quot;) Sutra, four more are listed.

====Daoism====

&quot;Virtue&quot;, translated from Chinese (), is also an important concept in Chinese philosophy, particularly Daoism. &quot;De&quot; () originally meant normative &quot;virtue&quot; in the sense of &quot;personal character; inner strength; integrity&quot;, but semantically changed to moral &quot;virtue; kindness; morality&quot;. Note the semantic parallel for English &quot;&quot;, with an archaic meaning of &quot;inner potency; divine power&quot; (as in &quot;by virtue of&quot;) and a modern one of &quot;moral excellence; goodness&quot;.

In early periods of Confucianism, moral manifestations of &quot;virtue&quot; include (&quot;humanity&quot;), &quot;xiao&quot; (&quot;filial piety&quot;), and (&quot;proper behavior, performance of rituals&quot;). The notion of – according to Simon Leys – means &quot;humanity&quot; and &quot;goodness&quot;. originally had the archaic meaning in the Confucian Book of Poems of &quot;virility&quot;, but progressively took on shades of ethical meaning. Some scholars consider the virtues identified in early Confucianism as non-theistic philosophy.

The Daoist concept of , compared to Confucianism, is more subtle, pertaining to the &quot;virtue&quot; or ability that an individual realizes by following the (&quot;the Way&quot;). One important normative value in much of Chinese thinking is that one&#x27;s social status should result from the amount of virtue that one demonstrates, rather than from one&#x27;s birth. In the &quot;Analects&quot;, Confucius explains as follows: &quot;He who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it.&quot; In later periods, particularly from the Tang dynasty period, Confucianism absorbed and melded its own concepts of virtues with those from Daoism and Buddhism.

There are symbols that represent virtue in Chinese Culture. Chinese classic paintings have many symbols representing virtue. Plum blossom represents resilience and perseverance. Orchid represents elegance, gentleness, and quietness. Bamboo represents loyalty, trust-worthiness, and humility. Chrysanthemum represents genuineness and simplicity.

====Hinduism====
Virtue is a much debated and an evolving concept in ancient scriptures of Hinduism. The essence, need and value of virtue is explained in Hindu philosophy as something that cannot be imposed, but something that is realized and voluntarily lived up to by each individual. For example, Apastamba explained it thus: &quot;virtue and vice do not go about saying—here we are!; neither the Gods, Gandharvas, nor ancestors can convince us—this is right, this is wrong; virtue is an elusive concept, it demands careful and sustained reflection by every man and woman before it can become part of one&#x27;s life.

Virtues lead to (, holy living) in Hindu literature; while vices lead to (, sin). Sometimes, the word is used interchangeably with virtue.

The virtues that constitute a dharmic life – that is a moral, ethical, virtuous life – evolved in vedas and upanishads. Over time, new virtues were conceptualized and added by ancient Hindu scholars: some replaced, others merged. For example, Manusamhita initially listed ten virtues necessary for a human being to live a dharmic life: (courage), (patience and forgiveness), (temperance), (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), (inner purity), (control of senses), (reflective prudence), (wisdom), (truthfulness), and (freedom from anger). In later verses, this list was reduced to five virtues by the same scholar, by merging and creating a broader concept. The shorter list of virtues became: (Non-violence), (self restraint), (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), (inner purity), and (truthfulness).

The Bhagavad Gita – considered one of the epitomes of historic Hindu discussion of virtues and an allegorical debate on what is right and what is wrong – argues some virtues are not necessarily always absolute, but sometimes relational. For example, it explains that a virtue such as must be re-examined when one is faced with war or violence from the aggressiveness, immaturity, or ignorance of others.

====Jainism====

In Jainism, attainment of &quot;kaivalya&quot; is possible only if the seeker possesses certain virtues. All Jains are supposed to take up the five vows of (non violence), (truthfulness), (non stealing), (non attachment), and (celibacy) before becoming a monk. These vows are laid down by the . Other virtues which are supposed to be followed by both monks as well as laypersons include forgiveness, humility, self-restraint, and straightforwardness. These vows assist the seeker to escape from the karmic bondages thereby escaping the cycle of birth and death to attain liberation.

====Sikhism====

Sikh ethics emphasize the congruence between spiritual development and everyday moral conduct. Its founder Guru Nanak summarized this perspective:Truth is the highest virtue, but higher still is truthful living.The Five Virtues of Sikhism are (truth), (compassion), (contentment), (humility), and (love).

==Modern philosophers&#x27; views==
===René Descartes===
For the Rationalist philosopher René Descartes, virtue consists in the correct reasoning that should guide our actions. Men should seek the sovereign good that Descartes, following Zeno, identifies with virtue, as this produces a blessedness or pleasure. For Epicurus the sovereign good was pleasure, and Descartes says that in fact this is not in contradiction with Zeno&#x27;s teaching, because virtue produces a spiritual pleasure, that is better than bodily pleasure. Regarding Aristotle&#x27;s opinion that happiness depends on the goods of fortune, Descartes does not deny that these goods contribute to happiness, but remarks that they are in great proportion outside one&#x27;s own control, whereas one&#x27;s mind is under one&#x27;s complete control.

===Immanuel Kant===

Immanuel Kant, in his &quot;Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime&quot;, says true virtue is different from what commonly is believed about it. In Kant&#x27;s view, to be goodhearted, benevolent and sympathetic is not true virtue. What makes a person truly virtuous is to behave in accordance with moral principles.

Kant presents an example: suppose that you come across a needy person in the street; if your sympathy leads you to help that person, your response does not illustrate your virtue. Kant applies the approach of four temperaments to distinguish truly virtuous people. According to Kant, among all people with diverse temperaments, a person with a melancholic frame of mind is the most virtuous, whose thoughts, words, and deeds are principled.

=== Friedrich Nietzsche ===
Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s view of virtue is based on the idea of an order of rank among people. For Nietzsche, the virtues of the strong are seen as vices by the weak and slavish, thus Nietzsche&#x27;s virtue ethics is based on his distinction between master morality and slave morality. Nietzsche promotes the virtues of those he calls &quot;higher men&quot;, people like Goethe and Beethoven. The virtues he praises in them are their creative powers (&quot;the men of great creativity, the really great men according to my understanding&quot;).
According to Nietzsche these higher types are solitary, pursue a &quot;unifying project&quot;, revere themselves and are healthy and life-affirming. Because mixing with the herd makes one base, the higher type &quot;strives instinctively for a citadel and a secrecy where he is saved from the crowd, the many, the great majority…&quot;. The &quot;Higher type&quot; also &quot;instinctively seeks heavy responsibilities&quot; in the form of an &quot;organizing idea&quot; for their life, which drives them to artistic and creative work and gives them psychological health and strength. The fact that the higher types are &quot;healthy&quot; for Nietzsche does not refer to physical health as much as a psychological resilience and fortitude. Finally, someone of the &quot;Higher type&quot; affirms life because he is willing to accept the eternal return of his life and affirm this forever and unconditionally.

In the last section of &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot;, Nietzsche outlines his thoughts on the noble virtues and places solitude as one of the highest virtues:

And to keep control over your four virtues: courage, insight, sympathy, solitude. Because solitude is a virtue for us, since it is a sublime inclination and impulse to cleanliness which shows that contact between people (&quot;society&quot;) inevitably makes things unclean. Somewhere, sometime, every community makes people – &quot;base.&quot;

Nietzsche also sees truthfulness as a virtue:

Genuine honesty, assuming that this is our virtue and we cannot get rid of it, we free spirits – well then, we will want to work on it with all the love and malice at our disposal and not get tired of &#x27;perfecting&#x27; ourselves in our virtue, the only one we have left: may its glory come to rest like a gilded, blue evening glow of mockery over this aging culture and its dull and dismal seriousness!

=== Benjamin Franklin ===

These are the virtues that Benjamin Franklin used to develop what he called &quot;moral perfection&quot;. He had a checklist in a notebook to measure each day how he lived up to his virtues.

They became known through Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s autobiography.
# Temperance: Eat not to Dullness. Drink not to Elevation.
# Silence: Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself. Avoid trifling Conversation.
# Order: Let all your Things have their Places. Let each Part of your Business have its Time.
# Resolution: Resolve to perform what you ought. Perform without fail what you resolve.
# Frugality: Make no Expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e. Waste nothing.
# Industry: Lose no Time. Be always employed in something useful. Cut off all unnecessary Actions.
# Sincerity: Use no hurtful Deceit. Think innocently and justly; and, if you speak, speak accordingly.
# Justice: Wrong none, by doing Injuries or omitting the Benefits that are your Duty.
# Moderation: Avoid Extremes. Forbear resenting Injuries so much as you think they deserve.
# Cleanliness: Tolerate no Uncleanness in Body, Clothes or Habitation.
# Tranquility: Be not disturbed at Trifles, or at Accidents common or unavoidable.
# Chastity: Rarely use but for Health or Offspring; Never to Dullness, Weakness, or the Injury of your own or another&#x27;s Peace or Reputation.
# Humility: Imitate Jesus and Socrates.
==Contemporary views==

===Virtues as emotions===
Marc Jackson in his book &quot;Emotion and Psyche&quot; identifies the virtues as what he calls the good emotions: &quot;The first group consisting of love, kindness, joy, faith, awe and pity is good&quot;. These virtues differ from older accounts of the virtues because they are not character traits expressed by action, but emotions that are to be felt and developed by feeling not acting.

Immanuel Kant, in his &quot;Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime&quot;, predicts and replies to Marc Johnson&#x27;s view of emotions as virtues. To be goodhearted, benevolent, and sympathetic is not true virtue, for one acts merely episodically, motivated by appeasing those naturally limited feelings, such as in the presence, for example, of a needy person in the street: in such a case, we do not act for a universal motive but simply as a response to end a particular, individual, personal distress arisen in us by our own sentiments.

===In modern psychology===
Christopher Peterson and Martin Seligman, two leading researchers in positive psychology, recognizing the deficiency inherent in psychology&#x27;s tendency to focus on dysfunction rather than on what makes a healthy and stable personality, set out to develop a list of &quot;Character Strengths and Virtues&quot;. After three years of study, 24 traits (classified into six broad areas of virtue) were identified, having &quot;a surprising amount of similarity across cultures and strongly indicat[ing] a historical and cross-cultural convergence.&quot; These six categories of virtue are courage, justice, humanity, temperance, transcendence, and wisdom. Some psychologists suggest that these virtues are adequately grouped into fewer categories; for example, the same 24 traits have been grouped into simply: Cognitive Strengths, Temperance Strengths, and Social Strengths.

==Vice as opposite==

The opposite of a virtue is a vice. Vice is a habitual, repeated practice of wrongdoing. One way of organizing the vices is as the corruption of the virtues.

As Aristotle noted, however, the virtues can have several opposites. Virtues can be considered the mean between two extremes, as the Latin maxim dictates —in the centre lies virtue. For instance, both cowardice and rashness are opposites of courage; contrary to prudence are both over-caution and insufficient caution; the opposites of pride (a virtue) are undue humility and excessive vanity. A more &quot;modern&quot; virtue, tolerance, can be considered the mean between the two extremes of narrow-mindedness on the one hand and over-acceptance on the other. Vices can therefore be identified as the opposites of virtues – but with the caveat that each virtue could have many different opposites, all distinct from each other.

Within the Chinese philosophy and Traditional Chinese Medicine vice and virtue are expressed as excess or deficiency.

<text>Pope Leo XII (; born Annibale Francesco Clemente Melchiorre Girolamo Nicola della Genga; 2 August 1760 – 10 February 1829) was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 28 September 1823 to his death in February 1829.

Leo XII was in ill health from the time of his election to the papacy to his death less than 6 years later, though he was noted for enduring pain well. He was a deeply conservative ruler, who enforced many controversial laws, including one forbidding Jews to own property. Though he raised taxes, the Papal States remained financially poor.

==Biography==
===Family===
Della Genga was born in 1760 at the Castello della Genga in the territory of Fabriano to an old noble family from Genga, a small town in the March of Ancona, part of the Papal States. He was the sixth of ten children born to Count Ilario della Genga and Maria Luisa Periberti di Fabriano, and he was the uncle of Gabriele della Genga Sermattei, who in the 19th century was the only nephew of a pope to be elevated to cardinal.

===Education and ordination===
Della Genga studied theology at the Collegio Campana in Osimo from 1773 to 1778 and later at the Collegio Piceno in Rome until 1783 when he commenced studies at the Pontifical Academy of Ecclesiastical Nobles. He later received the subdiaconate in 1782 and then the diaconate and was ordained to the priesthood on 14 June 1783; he received the latter two from Cardinal Marcantonio Colonna.

===Papal nuncio and episcopate===
In 1790 the attractive and articulate della Genga attracted favourable attention by a tactful oration commemorative of the late Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1794 Pope Pius VI made him a canon of Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica, and in 1793 created him Titular Archbishop of Tyre. He was consecrated in Rome in 1794 after the appointment and was despatched to Lucerne as the Apostolic Nuncio to Switzerland. In 1794 he was transferred to the Apostolic Nunciature to Cologne, but owing to the war had to make his residence in Augsburg. At this time, he believed it would be his last post and organized the construction of tombs for his mother and for himself.

During the dozen or more years he spent in Germany he was entrusted with several honourable and difficult missions, which brought him into contact with the courts of Dresden, Vienna, Munich and Stuttgart, as well as with Napoleon. It is charged, however, that during this period his finances were disordered, and his private life was not above suspicion.

After the Napoleonic abolition of the States of the Church (1798), he lived for some years at Monticelli Abbey, solacing himself with music and with bird-shooting, pastimes which he continued even after his election as Pope.

===Cardinal===

In 1814 della Genga was chosen to carry Pope Pius VII&#x27;s congratulations to Louis XVIII of France upon his restoration.

On 8 March 1816 he was created Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria in Trastevere and he received his red zucchetto on 11 March and his titular church on 29 April 1816. Later he was appointed as the Archpriest of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, and appointed to the episcopal see of Sinigaglia, which he resigned in 1818 for health reasons. He resigned without ever having entered his diocese.

On 9 May 1820, Pope Pius VII gave him the distinguished post of Vicar-General of His Holiness for the Diocese of Rome.

==Pontificate==
===Papal election===

Pope Pius VII died in 1823 after yet another long pontificate that spanned over two decades. In the conclave of 1823, della Genga was the candidate of the zelanti faction and in spite of the active opposition of France, he was elected as the new pope by the cardinals on 28 September 1823, taking the name of Leo XII.

His election had been facilitated because he was thought to be close to death, but he unexpectedly rallied. He had even remarked about his own health to the cardinals, saying that they would be electing &quot;a dead man&quot;. It was said in the conclave that he lifted his robes to show the cardinals a pair of swollen and ulcerated legs to deter them, but that made them even more eager to elect him. Before the conclave opened, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies indicated that it objected to five candidates in the election which included della Genga. While della Genga did not receive a single vote in the first and second ballots, he received seven in the third and then four in the fifth. While it seemed that Cardinal Antonio Gabriele Severoli would prevail on 21 September since he had just below the needed amount, Cardinal Giuseppe Albani interposed the veto on the behalf of the Austrian Empire against Severoli. While it was later indicated that the French court would not be amenable to the election of della Genga, Severoli&#x27;s voting bloc decided to cast their votes for della Genga, seeing him receive 34 votes to become pope.

Leo XII was 63 at the time of his election and frequently fell victim to infirmities. He was tall and thin with an ascetic look and a melancholic countenance. At this time Vincent Strambi served as bishop for the remainder of the pontificate of Pope Pius VII before his successor Pope Leo XII accepted Strambi&#x27;s resignation and summoned him to Rome as his advisor. But the sudden illness of the pope – which seemed to prove fatal – prompted Strambi to offer his own life to God so that the pope could live. Leo XII rallied to great surprise but Strambi died of a stroke within the week.

So Leo XII fell ill after his coronation but after his recovery, he showed surprising endurance in carrying out his work. Leo XII devoted himself to his work and was simple in his mode of life. He had a passion for shooting birds and was rumored to have killed a peasant with whom he argued about sporting rights.

The cardinal protodeacon Fabrizio Ruffo crowned him as pontiff on 5 October 1823.

===Foreign policy===
Pius VII&#x27;s Cardinal Secretary of State, Ercole Consalvi, who had been della Genga&#x27;s rival in the conclave, was immediately dismissed, and Pius&#x27; policies rejected. Leo XII&#x27;s foreign policy, entrusted at first to the octogenarian Giulio Maria della Somaglia and then to the more able Tommaso Bernetti, negotiated certain concordats very advantageous to the papacy. Personally most frugal, Leo XII reduced taxes, made justice less costly, and was able to find money for certain public improvements, yet he left the Church&#x27;s finances more confused than he had found them, and even the elaborate jubilee of 1825 did not really mend financial matters.

===Domestic policy===
Leo XII&#x27;s domestic policy was one of extreme conservatism: &quot;He was determined to change the condition of society, bringing it back to the utmost of his power to the old usages and ordinances, which he deemed to be admirable; and he pursued that object with never flagging zeal.&quot; He condemned the Bible societies, and under Jesuit influence reorganised the educational system, placing it entirely under priestly control through his bull &quot;Quod divina sapientia&quot; and requiring that all secondary instruction be carried out in Latin, as he required of all court proceedings, also now entirely in ecclesiastical hands. All charitable institutions in the Papal States were put under direct supervision.

Laws such as that forbidding Jews to own property and allowing them only the shortest possible time in which to sell what they owned, and that requiring all Roman residents to listen to Catholic catechism commentary, led many of Rome&#x27;s Jews to emigrate, to Trieste, Lombardy and Tuscany.

&quot;The results of his method of governing his states soon showed themselves in insurrections, conspiracies, assassinations and rebellion, especially in Umbria, the Marches and Romagna; the violent repression of which, by a system of espionage, secret denunciation, and wholesale application of the gibbet and the galleys, left behind it to those who were to come afterwards a very terrible, rankling and long-enduring debt of party hatreds, of political and social demoralisation, andworst of alla contempt for and enmity to the law, as such.&quot; In a regime that saw the division of the population into Carbonari and Sanfedisti, he hunted down the Carbonari and the Freemasons with their liberal sympathisers.

Leo XII made himself unpopular with the people due to the fact that he constrained them to endless rules that concerned private life and public affairs. He decreed that a dressmaker who sold low or transparent dresses would incur ipso facto excommunication. The pope also denied the Jews the right to possess material possessions and allowed them the shortest time to sell their belongings. He revived the regulations of the Middle Ages in regard to segregation and marks for identification.

While often considered an archconservative Leo XII held a high opinion of the liberal Catholic priest Lamennais having a portrait of him hung in his private chambers. When the later visited Rome in 1824 Leo offered him a Vatican apartment and in 1828 a cardinalate. According to Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman before the full consistory he said that Lamennais was &quot; a distinguished writer, whose works had not only rendered eminent services to religion, but rejoiced and astonished Europe.&quot; However some believe that the quote was actually about the historian John Lingard.

Leo XII had a fascination with archeology. When Jean-François Champollion deciphered the Egyptian hieroglyphs, Leo XII invited him to Rome to study its obelisks. Leo XII later printed and engraved Champollion&#x27;s work at his personal expense. Champollion later wrote to Cardinal Wiseman that &quot;It is a
real service which his Holiness renders to science, and I shall be happy if you will be good enough to place at his feet the homage of my profound acknowledgment.

===Vaccination controversy===

According to some contemporary authors such as G. S. Godkin, Leo XII was also said to have prohibited vaccination. More recent scholarship has been unable to find any ban or any suggestion of a ban by Leo XII and his administration. Donald J. Keefe traced a quote by Leo XII which strongly condemned vaccination to &quot;an unverified citation&quot; by Dr. Pierre Simon in &quot;Histoire et philosophie du contrôle des naissances&quot;. The response of the Papacy to the arrival of vaccination in Italy has been documented in &quot;Pratique de la vaccination antivariolique dans les provinces de l’État pontifical au 19ème siècle&quot;, an article written by Yves-Marie Bercé and Jean-Claude Otteni for Revue d’Histoire Ecclésiastique. According to Bercé and Otteni, the biographers and contemporaries of Leo XII do not mention any interdict. The authors credit the origin of the mythical vaccination ban of Leo XII to the personality of Cardinal della Genga when he became pope in 1823. His intransigence and piety alienated liberal opinion very quickly. His austere spirituality made him the target of criticisms and mocking remarks. English travelers visiting the peninsula and many of the diplomats established in Rome remarked on the severity of the pontiff.

The absence of a prohibition is evidenced by the fact that in 1828 the Medical-Surgical Society of Bologna was able to implement a vaccination campaign.

===Activities===
====Beatifications and canonizations====
Leo XII beatified a number of individuals in his pontificate which totaled at 15. He beatified: Angelina di Marsciano and Bernardo Scammacca (8 March 1825), Hippolytus Galantini (29 June 1825), Angelus of Gualdo Tadino (3 August 1825) and Angelus of Acri (18 December 1825). He also beatified in 1825: Julian of Saint Augustine, Alphonsus Rodriguez and Jakob Griesinger. He beatified Imelda Lambertini (20 December 1826) and also confirmed the cultus of Jordan of Saxony in 1826. He also beatified Yolanda of Poland and Maddalena Panattieri on 26 September 1827 as well as Giovanna Soderini (1827) and Elena Duglioli and Juana de Aza (the mother of Saint Dominic) in 1828.

Leo XII also created Peter Damian a Doctor of the Church on 27 September 1828 in addition to the formal canonization he presided over.

====Saint Vincenzo Strambi====
He collaborated with Vincent Strambi (future saint)who served as his advisor. When he was on the brink of death in 1825, Strambi offered himself to God for the survival of the pope. The pope rallied from his ailment, but Strambi died.

====Religious congregations====
The pope also approved the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate on 17 February 1826 when he gave the congregation official recognition.

====Jubilee====

Leo XII celebrated the jubilee in 1825 in an event that saw more than half a million pilgrims travel to Rome to participate in the solemnities. To mark the event, Leo XII issued the encyclical &quot;Quod hoc ineunte&quot; on 24 May 1825 that proclaimed the jubilee.

====Consistories====

He held 8 consistories in which he elevated 25 new cardinals into the cardinalate. This included Cardinal Bartolomeo Alberto Cappellari – the future Pope Gregory XVI – on 13 March 1826. In addition, Leo XII nominated three cardinals whom he reserved &quot;in pectore&quot; but later revealed.

For the December 1824 allocations, Leo XII considered elevating Félicité de La Mennais despite knowing about his crude character and extreme social and moral positions. Nevertheless, the nomination never occurred, however, other sources allege that he declined the pope&#x27;s invitation. For the October 1826 allocation, Leo XII had nominated one cardinal &quot;in pectore&quot; whom he later revealed in 1828, however, several subsequent sources indicate that the renowned English historian John Lingard was also created a cardinal &quot;in pectore&quot; and simply never announced. In the 1828 consistory, the Bishop of Osimo e Cingoli Timoteo Maria Ascensi was to be made a cardinal but died nine days before the consistory occurred.

==Death and legacy==
On 5 February 1829, after a private audience with the new Cardinal Secretary of State, Tommaso Bernetti, he was suddenly taken ill and he seemed to know that his end was near. On 8 February, he asked for and received the Viaticum and was anointed. On 9 February, he lapsed into unconsciousness and on the next morning, he died. The minister to Rome for French King Charles X, François-René de Chateaubriand, who was near to the events, wrote: &quot;The pope died of that haemorrhoidal condition to which he was subject. The blood, being carried to the bladder, occasioned a retention which they tried to relieve by means of an incision. It is thought His Holiness was injured by the operation. However it may be, after four days of suffering, Leo XII died this morning at nine as I was arriving at the Vatican, where an agent of the Embassy had spent the night.&quot; He was buried in a monument of him in Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica on 15 February 1829. His remains were transferred and buried before the altar of Pope Leo I on 5 December 1830.

Leo XII is considered to have been a man of noble character, with a passion for order and efficiency, but one who lacked insight into the temporal developments of his time. His rule was unpopular in Rome and in the Papal States, and by various measures of his reign he diminished greatly for his successors their chances of solving the new problems that confronted them.

===Rumors of a liaison===
It was alleged that Leo XII had a liaison as a prelate with the wife of a Swiss Guard (known as Pfiffer). The allegation was brought to the attention of Pope Pius VI, who met with the prelate to discern the truth of the matter. He refuted all claims to the pope and the matter was dropped then and there save for the fact that Della Genga affirmed he was close to Pfiffer.

<text>Scoti or Scotti is a Latin name for the Gaels, first attested in the late 3rd century. It originally referred to all Gaels, first those in Ireland and then those who had settled in Great Britain as well; it later came to refer only to Gaels in northern Britain. The kingdom to which their culture spread became known as &quot;Scotia&quot; or Scotland, and eventually all its inhabitants came to be known as Scots.

==History==
An early use of the word can be found in the &quot;Nomina Provinciarum Omnium&quot; (Names of All the Provinces), which dates to about AD 312. This is a short list of the names and provinces of the Roman Empire. At the end of this list is a brief list of tribes deemed to be a growing threat to the Empire, which included the &quot;Scoti&quot;, as a new term for the Irish. There is also a reference to the word in St Prosper&#x27;s chronicle of AD 431 where he describes Pope Celestine sending St Palladius to Ireland to preach &quot;ad Scotti in Christum&quot; (&quot;to the Scots who believed in Christ&quot;).

Thereafter, periodic raids by Scoti are reported by several later 4th and early 5th century Latin writers, namely Pacatus, Ammianus Marcellinus, Claudian and the Chronica Gallica of 452. Two references to Scoti have been identified in Greek literature (as Σκόττοι), in the works of Epiphanius, Bishop of Salamis, writing in the 370s. The fragmentary evidence suggests an intensification of Scoti raiding from the early 360s, culminating in the so-called &quot;barbarian conspiracy&quot; of 367–368, and continuing up to and beyond the end of Roman rule c. 410. The location and frequency of attacks by Scoti remain unclear, as do the origin and identity of the Gaelic population-groups who participated in these raids.

By the 5th century, the Gaelic or &quot;Scottish&quot; kingdom of Dál Riata had emerged in the area of modern Scotland that is now Argyll. Although this kingdom was destroyed and subjugated by the Pictish kingdom of the 8th century under Angus I, the convergence of Pictish and Gaelic languages over several centuries resulted in the English labelling Pictland under Constantine II as &quot;Scottish&quot; in the early 10th century, first attested in AD 920, viewing the Picts as speaking a Gaelic tongue. The growing influence of the English and Scots languages from the 12th century with the introduction of Anglo-French knights and southerly expansion of Scotland&#x27;s borders by David I saw the terms &quot;Scot&quot;, &quot;Scottish&quot; and &quot;Scotland&quot; also begin to be used commonly by natives of that country.

==Etymology==
The etymology of Late Latin &quot;Scoti&quot; is unclear. It is not a Latin derivation, nor does it correspond to any known Goidelic (Gaelic) term the Gaels used to name themselves as a whole or a constituent population group. Several derivations have been conjectured, but none has gained general acceptance in mainstream scholarship. 

In the 19th century, Aonghas MacCoinnich proposed that &quot;Scoti&quot; came from Gaelic &quot;sgaothaich&quot;, meaning &quot;crowd&quot; or &quot;horde&quot;.

Charles Oman (1910) derived it from Gaelic &quot;scuit&quot;, meaning someone cut off. He believed it referred to bands of outcast Gaelic raiders, suggesting that the Scots were to the Gaels what the Vikings were to the Norse.

More recently, Philip Freeman (2001) has speculated on the likelihood of a group of raiders adopting a name from an Indo-European root, *&quot;skot&quot;, citing the parallel in the Ancient Greek &quot;skotos&quot; (σκότος), meaning &quot;darkness, gloom&quot;.

Linguist Kim McCone (2013) derives it from the Old Irish noun &quot;scoth&quot; meaning &quot;pick&quot;, as in &quot;the pick&quot; of the population, the nobility, from an Archaic Irish reconstruction &quot;*skotī&quot;.

An origin has also been suggested in a word related to the English &quot;scot&quot; (&quot;tax&quot;) and Old Norse &quot;skot&quot;; this referred to an activity in ceremonies whereby ownership of land was transferred by placing a parcel of earth in the lap of a new owner, whence 11th-century King Olaf, one of Sweden&#x27;s first known rulers, may have been known as a &quot;scot king&quot;.

<text>Canton of Basel-Landschaft or Basel-Country, informally known as Baselland or Baselbiet (; ; ; ; ), is one of the 26 cantons forming the Swiss Confederation. It is composed of five districts and its capital city is Liestal. It is traditionally considered a &quot;half-canton&quot;, the other half being Basel-Stadt, its urban counterpart.

Basel-Landschaft is one of the northernmost cantons of Switzerland. It lies essentially south of the Rhine and north of the Jura Mountains. The canton shares borders with the canton of Basel-Stadt to the north, the canton of Aargau to the east, the canton of Solothurn to the south and the canton of Jura to the west. It shares international borders as well with France and Germany to the north.

Together with Basel-Stadt, Basel-Landschaft was part of the canton of Basel, which joined the Old Swiss Confederacy in 1501. Political quarrels and armed conflict led to the partition of the canton in 1833.

==History==

Basel-Landschaft, together with Basel-Stadt, formed the historic Canton of Basel until they separated following the uprising of 1833 (Battle of the Hülftenschanz near Frenkendorf).
In Roman times, the area of Basel was a centre of Roman activity. There are well-preserved remains at the site of &quot;Augusta Raurica&quot; in the canton of Basel-Landschaft. Around 200 AD there were about 20,000 people living in this city, now part of the much smaller Augst. The remains are on display in an open-air museum. The museum attracts over 140,000 visitors per year. Many of these visitors are schoolchildren from other parts of Switzerland. The site of Augusta Raurica includes the best-preserved amphitheatre north of the Alps, and a reconstructed Roman villa.

The lands of the canton Basel-Landschaft are part of the lands acquired by the city of Basel. Until the end of the 16th century, most of the canton&#x27;s land belonged to the city of Basel. After Napoleon&#x27;s visit in 1798, the country achieved equality with the city. The country was economically dependent on the city, most probably because of the cost and difficulty in transporting agricultural goods to further markets, the financing of land transactions and crop production by city-based merchants. Low levels of education and literacy in the agricultural areas of Europe was typical in that era. The best students would be sponsored and sent away for higher learning. The city of Basel remained the cultural and economic centre of both Basel half cantons until then. Castles and residences of Basel merchants dominated much of the landscape in Basel-Landschaft.
After 1830 there were political quarrels and armed conflict in the canton of Basel. Some of these were concerned with the rights of the population in the agricultural areas. They ultimately led to the separation of the canton Basel-Landschaft from the city of Basel on 26 August 1833. Since then, there has been a movement for reunification. This movement gained momentum after 1900 when many parts of Basel-Landschaft became industrialized. The two half cantons agreed in principle to merge, but in 1969 the people of Basel-Landschaft voted down a referendum on this proposal in favour of retaining their independence. It is thought that the closing economic gap between the two cantons was the main reason why the population changed their attitude.

That vote was not the end of a close relationship between the two Basels. The two half cantons have since signed a number of agreements to co-operate. The contribution of Basel-Landschaft to the University of Basel since 1976 is just one example.

==Geography==
The canton of Basel-Landschaft lies in the northwestern corner of Switzerland just south of the canton of Basel-Stadt.

With a few exceptions, it includes the towns of the Laufental along the river Birs, the Birseck and the Leimental, as well as the towns along the Ergolz and its tributaries. The shape of the canton is very irregular, and its borders cut across several towns.

In terms of size, it is one of the smaller cantons of Switzerland (18th of 26). However, it is number 10 in terms of population.

Basel-Landschaft borders on the east and north with the canton of Aargau and the Rhine, which forms the border with Germany (state of Baden-Württemberg). On the northwest, it borders with France (department of Haut-Rhin).

On the south, it borders on the canton of Solothurn, with a few exclaves of that canton within its western area. In the extreme southwest, it borders on the canton of Jura.

The Jura mountain chain traverses the canton. The rivers Ergolz and Birs drain the lands of the canton.

The thirty rivers of Baselland are:

* Ergolz
* Eibach
* Homburger Bach
* Diegter Bach
* Walibach
* Vordere Frenke
* Fluebach
* Hintere Frenke
* Frenke
* Orisbach
* Röserenbach
* Arisdorfer Bach
* Violenbach
* Wintersinger Bach
* Buuser Bach
* Magdener Bach
* Hemmiker Bach
* Rickenbächlein
* Rhein
* Birsig
* Binnbach
* Marchbach
* Birs
* Seebach
* Chastelbach
* Ibach
* Dürrbach
* Lüssel
* Wahlenbach
* Lützel
==Politics==

Since the decision to remain independent from Basel-Stadt in 1969 there have been a number of requests in the parliament for Basel-Landschaft to become a &quot;full&quot; canton. In 1988 the canton of Basel-Landschaft had this aim written into its constitution. The aim remains to change the Swiss constitution to recognize the two cantons of Basel as full members.

===Federal election results===

: FDP before 2009, FDP.The Liberals after 2009
: &quot;*&quot; indicates that the party was not on the ballot in this canton.
: Part of the GPS
: CVP and BDP merged to form The Centre party.

==Political subdivisions==
The nine municipalities of the &quot;Arlesheim&quot; district used to belong to the diocese of Basel. In 1792 French troops occupied the district and in 1793 the lands were annexed by France, which explains the linguistic switch of the Family of the House of Basel&#x27;s name from &quot;von Basel&quot; to &quot;de Bâle&quot;, since Arlesheim holds their manor. In 1815 at the Congress of Vienna the district joined Basel.

The district of &quot;Laufental&quot; has the same history as that of &quot;Arlesheim&quot;. The important difference is that in 1815 Laufental joined Bern rather than Basel. When the canton of Jura was created in 1979, the district of Laufental became an enclave of the canton of Bern. It was allowed self- determination and in 1980 the people decided to join the canton of Basel-Landschaft. This led to &quot;Laufental&quot; joining the canton of Basel-Landschaft on 1 January 1994 after a lengthy administrative process.

===Districts===

There are 5 areas (Bezirke) in Basel-Landschaft ():
*Arlesheim (&quot;Pop:&quot; ) capital: Arlesheim (&quot;Pop:&quot; )
*Laufen (&quot;Pop:&quot; ) capital: Laufen (&quot;Pop:&quot; )
*Liestal (&quot;Pop:&quot; ) capital: Liestal (&quot;Pop:&quot; )
*Sissach (&quot;Pop:&quot; ) capital: Sissach (&quot;Pop:&quot; )
*Waldenburg (&quot;Pop:&quot; ) capital: Waldenburg (&quot;Pop:&quot; )

===Municipalities===

There are 86 municipalities in the canton ().

==Demographics==
The population is predominantly German-speaking. Protestantism is the main religion in the canton (43% ), while about one-third of the population (32%) is Roman Catholic. The Swiss Reformed Church and Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland are recognized as state churches. Between 1959 and 1970 the canton was Switzerland&#x27;s fastest-growing, as the population almost doubled from 108,000 to 205,000. In 2021, the canton had a population of . , the population included 48,719 foreign residents, who made up 18.1% of the population.

=== Historical population ===
The historical population is given in the following table:
== Economy ==

Agriculture in the canton includes fruit growing, dairy farming and cattle breeding. Important industries include textiles, metals and chemicals.

The canton of Basel-Landschaft is part of the economic region around Basel that includes parts of France and Germany as well as both half cantons of Basel. Since the 1960s there are agreements in force to strengthen contacts within the so-called &quot;Regio Basiliensis&quot;. This economic co-operation is often considered as the most intensive in Europe.

From the 17th century until the beginning of the 20th century silk weaving was important in Basel-Landschaft. Factories were established as early as 1850, following the finding of salt in underground deposits, founding industries such as the chemical industry in &quot;Schweizerhalle&quot;. The chemical industry means that Basel is one of the richer parts of Switzerland.

<text>Norman Granz (August 6, 1918 – November 22, 2001) was an American jazz record producer and concert promoter. He founded the record labels Clef, Norgran, Down Home, Verve, and Pablo and the Jazz at the Philharmonic concert series. Granz was acknowledged as &quot;the most successful impresario in the history of jazz&quot;. He was also a champion of racial equality, insisting, for example, on integrating audiences at concerts he promoted.

==Biography==
Born in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles, Granz was the son of Jewish immigrants from Tiraspol (now in Moldova). After school, he began work as a stock clerk on the Los Angeles stock exchange. When America joined the Second World War, he was drafted into the U.S. Army Air Force. Subsequently, he was posted to the Morale branch, the department charged with troops&#x27; entertainment.
He then emerged into the public view when he organised desegregated jam sessions at the Trouville Club in Los Angeles, which he later expanded when he staged a memorable concert at the Philharmonic Auditorium in Los Angeles on Sunday, July 2, 1944, under the heading of &quot;Jazz at the Philharmonic&quot;.

The title of the concert, &quot;A Jazz Concert at the Philharmonic Auditorium&quot;, had been shortened by the printer of the advertising supplements to &quot;Jazz at the Philharmonic&quot;. Only one copy of the first concert program is known to exist. Norman Granz had organised the first Jazz at the Philharmonic concert with about $300 of borrowed money. Later known as JATP, the ever-changing group recorded and toured extensively, with Granz producing some of the first live jam session recordings to be distributed to a wide market.

After several JATP concerts in Los Angeles in 1944 and 1945, Granz began producing JATP concert tours, from late fall of 1945 to 1957 in USA and Canada, and from 1952 in Europe. They featured swing and bop musicians and were among the first high-profile performances to feature racially integrated bands. Granz actually cancelled some bookings rather than have the musicians perform for segregated audiences. He recorded many of the JATP concerts, and from 1945 to 1947 sold/leased the recordings to Asch/Disc/Stinson Records (record producer Moses Asch&#x27;s labels).

In 1948, Granz signed an agreement with Mercury Records for the promotion and the distribution of the JATP recordings and other recordings. After the agreement expired in 1953 he issued the JATP recordings and other recordings on Clef Records (founded 1946) and Norgran Records (founded 1953). Down Home Records was intended for traditional jazz works. In 1956, Granz also signed an agreement with the A&amp;R Ben Selvin to showcase several JATP recordings within the RCA Thesaurus library, including performances by such jazz luminaries as Count Basie, Roy Eldridge, Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, Gene Krupa, Oscar Peterson, and Art Tatum. Jazz at the Philharmonic ceased touring the United States and Canada after the JATP concerts in the fall of 1957, apart from a North American Tour in 1967.

==Personal life==
Granz married three times. In 1950, he married Loretta (née Snyder) Sullivan from Michigan; they had a daughter together, Stormont Granz, who was disabled due to lack of oxygen during the birth. Loretta was previously married and had a child, Sydney Sullivan Hamed, whom Granz adopted. They separated in 1953 and divorced in 1955. In 1965, he married Hannelore Granz, a former airline stewardess from Germany. In 1974, he married Grete Lyngby from Denmark.

Granz was also interested in art, developing a friendship with Pablo Picasso, whom he met in 1968.

Granz died of cancer on November 22, 2001, at the age of 83, in Geneva, Switzerland.

===Racial equality efforts===
Norman Granz opposed racism and fought many battles for his artists, many of whom were Black. In 1955, in Houston, he removed signs that previously designated &quot;White&quot; and &quot;Negro&quot; restrooms outside the auditorium where two concerts were to be performed by Ella Fitzgerald and Dizzy Gillespie. Between the two shows, Fitzgerald and Gillespie and Illinois Jacquet were shooting small-stakes dice in the dressing room to kill time, when the local police barged in and arrested them. After some negotiations, the artists were allowed to perform the second show and later were formally released on $50 bail. Granz was incensed by the incident and insisted on fighting the charges in court, which was successful but cost him over $2,000.

Oscar Peterson recounted how Granz once insisted that white cabdrivers take his black artists as customers, while a policeman pointed a loaded pistol at his stomach. Granz also was among the first to pay white and black artists the same salary, and to give them equal treatment even in minor details such as dressing rooms. He insisted on equal treatment for singer Ella Fitzgerald, in both pay and hotel accommodations.

Granz also spearheaded the fight to desegregate the hotels and casinos in Las Vegas, arguing that it was unfair that black artists could perform on the stages, but could not stay or gamble at the hotels, or even enter through the front doors.

==Recordings==
Many of the names that made history in jazz signed with one of Norman Granz&#x27;s labels, including Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, Count Basie, Mort Sahl, Louie Bellson, Benny Carter, Buck Clayton, Buddy DeFranco, Roy Eldridge, Herb Ellis, Tal Farlow, Stan Getz, Dizzy Gillespie, Lionel Hampton, Coleman Hawkins, Johnny Hodges, Billie Holiday, Illinois Jacquet, Hank Jones, Gene Krupa, Anita O&#x27;Day (the first artist to sign with Verve), Charlie Parker, Joe Pass, Oscar Peterson, Flip Phillips, Bud Powell, Buddy Rich, Sonny Stitt, Slim Gaillard, Art Tatum, Ben Webster and Lester Young.

Granz saw to it that his musicians were well paid. In the segregated society of the 1940s, he insisted on equal pay and accommodation for white and Black musicians. He refused to take his hugely popular concerts to places that were segregated, even if he had to cancel concerts, thereby sacrificing considerable sums of money.

In 1944, Granz and Gjon Mili produced the jazz film &quot;Jammin&#x27; the Blues&quot;, which starred Lester Young, Illinois Jacquet, Barney Kessel, Harry Edison, Jo Jones, Sidney Catlett, Marlowe Morris, and Marie Bryant, and was nominated for an Academy Award.

It was in 1956 that the popular singer Ella Fitzgerald finally joined Norman Granz&#x27;s label. Granz had been her manager for some time, and unified his activities under the common label of Verve Records. Granz became Fitzgerald&#x27;s manager, and remained so until the end of her career. Fitzgerald&#x27;s memorable series of eight &quot;Songbooks&quot;, together with the duet series (notably Armstrong-Peterson, Fitzgerald-Basie, Fitzgerald-Pass and Getz-Peterson) achieved wide popularity and brought acclaim to the label and to the artists. Granz was also the manager of Oscar Peterson, another lifelong friend.

In 1959, Norman Granz moved to Switzerland. In December 1960, Verve Records was sold to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

Granz founded his last label, Pablo Records, in 1973. He sold Pablo to Fantasy Records in 1989.

<text>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (born Lucius Septimius Bassianus, 4 April 188 – 8 April 217), better known by his nickname Caracalla (), was Roman emperor from 198 to 217 AD, first serving as nominal co-emperor under his father and then ruling alone after 211 AD. He was a member of the Severan dynasty, the elder son of Emperor Septimius Severus and Empress Julia Domna. Severus proclaimed Caracalla co-ruler in 198, doing the same with his other son Geta in 209. The two brothers briefly shared power after their father&#x27;s death in 211, but Caracalla soon had Geta murdered by the Praetorian Guard and became sole ruler of the Roman Empire. Julia Domna had a significant share in governance, since Caracalla found administration to be mundane. His reign featured domestic instability and external invasions by the Germanic peoples.

Caracalla issued the Antonine Constitution (), also known as the Edict of Caracalla, which granted Roman citizenship to all free men throughout the Roman Empire. The edict gave all the enfranchised men Caracalla&#x27;s adopted praenomen and nomen: &quot;Marcus Aurelius&quot;. Other landmarks of his reign were the construction of the Baths of Caracalla, the second-largest bathing complex in the history of Rome, the introduction of a new Roman currency named the &quot;antoninianus&quot;, a sort of double &quot;denarius&quot;, and the massacres he ordered, both in Rome and elsewhere in the empire. In 216, Caracalla began a campaign against the Parthian Empire. He did not see this campaign through to completion due to his assassination by a disaffected soldier in 217. Macrinus succeeded him as emperor three days later.

The ancient sources portray Caracalla as a cruel tyrant; his contemporaries Cassius Dio ( 155 – 235) and Herodian ( 170 – 240) present him as a soldier first and an emperor second. In the 12th century, Geoffrey of Monmouth started the legend of Caracalla&#x27;s role as king of Britain. Later, in the 18th century, the works of French painters revived images of Caracalla due to apparent parallels between Caracalla&#x27;s tyranny and that ascribed to king Louis XVI (). Modern works continue to portray Caracalla as an evil ruler, painting him as one of the most tyrannical of all Roman emperors.

== Names ==
Caracalla&#x27;s name at birth was Lucius Septimius Bassianus. He was renamed Marcus Aurelius Antoninus at the age of seven as part of his father&#x27;s attempt at union with the families of Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius. According to the 4th-century historian Aurelius Victor in his &quot;Epitome de Caesaribus&quot;, he became known by the agnomen &quot;Caracalla&quot; after a Gallic hooded tunic that he habitually wore and made fashionable. He may have begun wearing it during his campaigns on the Rhine and Danube. Cassius Dio, who was still writing his &quot;Historia romana&quot; during Caracalla&#x27;s reign, generally referred to him as &quot;Tarautas&quot;, after a famously diminutive and violent gladiator of the time, though he also calls him &quot;Caracallus&quot; on various occasions.

== Early life ==

Caracalla was born in Lugdunum, Gaul (now Lyon, France), on 4April 188 to Septimius Severus () and Julia Domna, thus giving him Punic paternal ancestry and Arab maternal ancestry. He had a slightly younger brother, Geta, with whom Caracalla briefly ruled as co-emperor. Caracalla was five years old when his father was acclaimed &quot;Augustus&quot; on 9 April 193.

=== &quot;Caesar&quot; ===
In early 195, Caracalla&#x27;s father Septimius Severus had himself adopted posthumously by the deified emperor (&quot;divus&quot;) Marcus Aurelius (); accordingly, in 195 or 196 Caracalla was given the imperial rank of &quot;Caesar&quot;, adopting the name Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Caesar, and was named &quot;imperator destinatus&quot; (or ) in 197, possibly on his birthday, 4 April, and certainly before 7 May. He thus technically became a part of the well-remembered Antonine dynasty.

=== Co-&quot;augustus&quot; ===
Caracalla&#x27;s father appointed Caracalla, aged 9, joint &quot;Augustus&quot; and full emperor from 28 January 198. This was the day Septimius Severus&#x27;s triumph was celebrated, in honour of his victory over the Parthian Empire in the Roman–Persian Wars; he had successfully sacked the Parthian capital, Ctesiphon, after winning the Battle of Ctesiphon, probably in October 197. He was also awarded tribunician power and the title of &quot;imperator&quot;. In inscriptions, Caracalla is given from 198 the title of the chief priesthood, &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;. His brother Geta was proclaimed &quot;nobilissimus caesar&quot; on the same day, and their father Septimius Severus was awarded the victory name &quot;Parthicus Maximus&quot;.

In 199, he was inducted into the Arval Brethren. By the end of 199, at age 11, he was entitled &quot;pater patriae&quot;. In 202, he was Roman consul, having been named &quot;consul designatus&quot; the previous year. His colleague was his father, serving his own third consulship.&quot;

In 202, Caracalla was forced to marry the daughter of Gaius Fulvius Plautianus, Fulvia Plautilla, whom he hated, though for what reason is unknown. The wedding took place between the 9 and the 15 April, just after he turned 14.

In 205, Caracalla was consul for the second time, in company with Geta – his brother&#x27;s first consulship. By 205, aged 16, Caracalla had got Plautianus executed for treason, though he had probably fabricated the evidence of the plot. It was then that he banished his wife, whose later killing might have been carried out under Caracalla&#x27;s orders.

On 28 January 207, at age 18, Caracalla celebrated his &quot;decennalia&quot;, the tenth anniversary of the beginning of his reign. The year 208 was the year of his third and Geta&#x27;s second consulship.&quot;&quot; Geta was himself granted the rank of &quot;Augustus&quot; and tribunician powers in September or October 209.

During the reign of his father, Caracalla&#x27;s mother Julia Domna had played a prominent public role, receiving titles of honour such as &quot;Mother of the camp&quot;, but she also played a role behind the scenes helping her husband administer the empire. Described as ambitious, Julia Domna surrounded herself with thinkers and writers from all over the empire. While Caracalla was mustering and training troops for his planned Persian invasion, Julia remained in Rome, administering the empire. Julia&#x27;s growing influence in state affairs was the beginning of a trend of emperors&#x27; mothers having influence, which continued throughout the Severan dynasty.

== Reign as senior emperor ==
=== Geta as co-&quot;augustus&quot; ===
On 4February 211, Septimius Severus died at Eboracum (present-day York, England) while on campaign in Caledonia, to the north of Roman Britain.

This left his two sons and co-&quot;augusti&quot;, Caracalla and his brother, Geta, as joint inheritors of their father&#x27;s throne and empire. Caracalla adopted his father&#x27;s &quot;cognomen&quot;, Severus, and assumed the chief priesthood as &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;. His name became &quot;Imperator Caesar Marcus Aurelius Severus Antoninus Pius Augustus&quot;.

Caracalla and Geta ended the Roman invasion of Caledonia after concluding a peace with the Caledonians that returned the border of Roman Britain to the line demarcated by Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. During the journey back from Britain to Rome with their father&#x27;s ashes, Caracalla and his brother continuously argued with one another, making relations between them increasingly hostile. Caracalla and Geta considered dividing the empire in half along the Bosphorus to make their co-rule less hostile. Caracalla was to rule in the west and Geta was to rule in the east. They were persuaded not to do this by their mother.

=== Geta&#x27;s murder ===

On 26 December 211, at a reconciliation meeting arranged by their mother, Geta was assassinated by members of the Praetorian Guard loyal to the 23-year-old Caracalla. Geta died in his mother&#x27;s arms. It is widely accepted, and clearly most likely, that Caracalla ordered the assassination himself, as the two had never been on favourable terms with one another, much less after succeeding their father.

Caracalla then persecuted and executed most of Geta&#x27;s supporters and ordered a &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; pronounced by the Senate against his brother&#x27;s memory. Geta&#x27;s image was removed from all paintings, coins were melted down, statues were destroyed, his name was struck from papyrus records, and it became a capital offence to speak or write Geta&#x27;s name. In the aftermath of the &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;, an estimated 20,000 people were massacred. Those killed were Geta&#x27;s inner circle of guards and advisers, friends, and other military staff under his employ.

== Reign as sole emperor ==

When Geta died in 211, Julia Domna&#x27;s responsibilities increased, because Caracalla found administrative tasks to be mundane. She may have taken on one of the more important civil functions of the emperor; receiving petitions and answering correspondence. The extent of her role in this position, however, is probably overstated. She may have represented her son and played a role in meetings and answering queries; however, the final authority on legal matters was Caracalla. The emperor filled all of the roles in the legal system as judge, legislator, and administrator.

=== &quot;Constitutio Antoniniana&quot; ===

The &quot;Constitutio Antoniniana&quot; (lit. &quot;Constitution of Antoninus&quot;, also called &quot;Edict of Caracalla&quot; or &quot;Antonine Constitution&quot;) was an edict issued in 212 by Caracalla declaring that all free men in the Roman Empire were to be given full Roman citizenship, with the exception of the &quot;dediticii&quot;, people who had become subject to Rome through surrender in war, and freed slaves.

Before 212, the majority of Roman citizens had been inhabitants of Roman Italia, with about 4–7% of all peoples in the Roman Empire being Roman citizens at the time of the death of Augustus in AD 14. Outside Rome, citizenship was restricted to Roman coloniaeRomans, or their descendants, living in the provinces, the inhabitants of various cities throughout the Empireand small numbers of local nobles such as kings of client countries. Provincials, on the other hand, were usually non-citizens, although some magistrates and their families and relatives held the Latin Right.

Dio maintains that one purpose for Caracalla issuing the edict was the desire to increase state revenue; at the time, Rome was in a difficult financial situation and needed to pay for the new pay raises and benefits that were being conferred on the military. The edict widened the obligation for public service and gave increased revenue through the inheritance and emancipation taxes that only had to be paid by Roman citizens. However, few of those that gained citizenship were wealthy, and while it is true that Rome was in a difficult financial situation, it is thought that this could not have been the sole purpose of the edict. The provincials also benefited from this edict because they were now able to think of themselves as equal partners to the Romans in the empire.

Another purpose for issuing the edict, as described within the papyrus upon which part of the edict was inscribed, was to appease the gods who had delivered Caracalla from conspiracy. The conspiracy in question was in response to Caracalla&#x27;s murder of Geta and the subsequent slaughter of his followers; fratricide would only have been condoned if his brother had been a tyrant. The &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; against Geta and the large payments Caracalla had made to his own supporters were designed to protect himself from possible repercussions. After this had succeeded, Caracalla felt the need to repay the gods of Rome by returning the favour to the people of Rome through a similarly grand gesture. This was done through the granting of citizenship.

Another purpose for issuing the edict might have been related to the fact that the periphery of the empire was now becoming central to its existence, and the granting of citizenship may have been simply a logical outcome of Rome&#x27;s continued expansion of citizenship rights.

=== Alamannic war ===
In 213, about a year after Geta&#x27;s death, Caracalla left Rome, never to return. He went north to the German frontier to deal with the Alamanni, a confederation of Germanic tribes who had broken through the &quot;limes&quot; in Raetia. During the campaign of 213–214, Caracalla successfully defeated some of the Germanic tribes while settling other difficulties through diplomacy, though precisely with whom these treaties were made remains unknown. While there, Caracalla strengthened the frontier fortifications of Raetia and Germania Superior, collectively known as the Agri Decumates, so that it was able to withstand any further barbarian invasions for another twenty years.

=== Provincial tour ===

In spring 214, Caracalla departed for the eastern provinces, travelling through the Danubian provinces and the Anatolian provinces of Asia and Bithynia. He spent the winter of 214/215 in Nicomedia. By 4 April 215 he had left Nicomedia, and in the summer he was in Antioch on the Orontes. By December 215 he was in Alexandria in the Nile Delta, where he stayed until March or April 216.

When the inhabitants of Alexandria heard of Caracalla&#x27;s claims that he had killed his brother Geta in self-defence, they produced a satire mocking this as well as Caracalla&#x27;s other pretensions. Caracalla responded to this insult by slaughtering the unsuspecting deputation of leading citizens that had assembled before the city to greet his arrival in December 215, before setting his troops against Alexandria for several days of looting and plunder.

In spring 216 he returned to Antioch and before 27 May had set out to lead his Roman army against the Parthians. During the winter of 215/216 he was in Edessa. Caracalla then moved east into Armenia. By 216 he had pushed through Armenia and south into Parthia.

=== Baths ===
Construction on the Baths of Caracalla in Rome began in 211 at the start of Caracalla&#x27;s rule. The &quot;thermae&quot; are named for Caracalla, though it is most probable that his father was responsible for their planning. In 216, a partial inauguration of the baths took place, but the outer perimeter of the baths was not completed until the reign of Severus Alexander.

These large baths were typical of the Roman practice of building complexes for social and state activities in large densely populated cities. The baths covered around 50 acres (or 202,000 square metres) of land and could accommodate around 1,600 bathers at any one time. They were the second largest public baths built in ancient Rome and were complete with swimming pools, exercise yards, a stadium, steam rooms, libraries, meeting rooms, fountains, and other amenities, all of which were enclosed within formal gardens. The interior spaces were decorated with colourful marble floors, columns, mosaics, and colossal statuary.

=== Caracalla and Serapis ===
At the outset of his reign, Caracalla declared imperial support for the Graeco-Egyptian god of healing Serapis. The Iseum and Serapeum in Alexandria were apparently renovated during Caracalla&#x27;s co-rule with his father Septimius Severus. The evidence for this exists in two inscriptions found near the temple that appear to bear their names. Additional archaeological evidence exists for this in the form of two papyri that have been dated to the Severan period and also two statues associated with the temple that have been dated to around 200AD. Upon Caracalla&#x27;s ascension to being sole ruler in 212, the imperial mint began striking coins bearing Serapis&#x27; image. This was a reflection of the god&#x27;s central role during Caracalla&#x27;s reign. After Geta&#x27;s death, the weapon that had killed him was dedicated to Serapis by Caracalla. This was most likely done to cast Serapis into the role of Caracalla&#x27;s protector from treachery.

Caracalla also erected a temple on the Quirinal Hill in 212, which he dedicated to Serapis. A fragmented inscription found in the church of Sant&#x27; Agata dei Goti in Rome records the construction, or possibly restoration, of a temple dedicated to the god Serapis. The inscription bears the name &quot;Marcus Aurelius Antoninus&quot;, a reference to either Caracalla or Elagabalus, but more likely to Caracalla due to his known strong association with the god. Two other inscriptions dedicated to Serapis, as well as a granite crocodile similar to one discovered at the Iseum et Serapeum, were also found in the area around the Quirinal Hill.

=== Monetary policy ===
The expenditures that Caracalla made with the large bonuses he gave to soldiers prompted him to debase the coinage soon after his ascension. At the end of Severus&#x27; reign and early into Caracalla&#x27;s, the Roman &quot;denarius&quot; had an approximate silver purity of around 55%, but by the end of Caracalla&#x27;s reign the purity had been reduced to about 51%.

In 215 Caracalla introduced the &quot;antoninianus&quot;, a coin intended to serve as a double &quot;denarius&quot;. This new currency, however, had a silver purity of about 52% for the period between 215 and 217 and an actual size ratio of 1&quot;antoninianus&quot; to 1.5denarii. This in effect made the &quot;antoninianus&quot; equal to about 1.5&quot;denarii.&quot; The reduced silver purity of the coins caused people to hoard the old coins that had higher silver content, aggravating the inflation problem caused by the earlier devaluation of the &quot;denarii&quot;.

=== Military policy ===
During his reign as emperor, Caracalla raised the annual pay of an average legionary from 2000 &quot;sesterces&quot; (500 &quot;denarii&quot;) to 2700–3000 &quot;sesterces&quot; (675–750 &quot;denarii&quot;). He lavished many benefits on the army, which he both feared and admired, in accordance with the advice given by his father on his deathbed always to heed the welfare of the soldiers and ignore everyone else. Caracalla needed to gain and keep the trust of the military, and he did so with generous pay raises and popular gestures. He spent much of his time with the soldiers, so much so that he began to imitate their dress and adopt their manners.

After Caracalla concluded his campaign against the Alamanni, it became evident that he was inordinately preoccupied with emulating Alexander the Great. He began openly mimicking Alexander in his personal style. In planning his invasion of the Parthian Empire, Caracalla decided to arrange 16,000 of his men in Macedonian-style phalanxes, despite the Roman army having made the phalanx an obsolete tactical formation. The historian Christopher Matthew mentions that the term &quot;Phalangarii&quot; has two possible meanings, both with military connotations. The first refers merely to the Roman battle line and does not specifically mean that the men were armed with pikes, and the second bears similarity to the &#x27;Marian Mules&#x27; of the late Roman Republic who carried their equipment suspended from a long pole, which were in use until at least the 2nd century AD. As a consequence, the &quot;phalangarii&quot; of Legio II Parthica may not have been pikemen, but rather standard battle line troops or possibly &quot;triarii&quot;.

Caracalla&#x27;s mania for Alexander went so far that he visited Alexandria while preparing for his Persian invasion and persecuted philosophers of the Aristotelian school based on a legend that Aristotle had poisoned Alexander. This was a sign of Caracalla&#x27;s increasingly erratic behaviour.

=== Parthian war ===

In 216, Caracalla pursued a series of aggressive campaigns in the east against the Parthians, intended to bring more territory under direct Roman control. He offered the king of Parthia, Artabanus IV of Parthia, a marriage proposal between himself and the king&#x27;s daughter. Artabanus refused the offer, realizing that the proposal was merely an attempt to unite the kingdom of Parthia under the control of Rome. In response, Caracalla used the opportunity to start a campaign against the Parthians. That summer Caracalla began to attack the countryside east of the Tigris in the Parthian war of Caracalla. In the following winter, Caracalla retired to Edessa, modern Şanlıurfa in south-east Turkey, and began making preparations to renew the campaign by spring.

== Death ==
At the beginning of 217, Caracalla was still based at Edessa before renewing hostilities against Parthia. On 8April 217 Caracalla, who had just turned 29, was travelling to visit a temple of the moon god Sin, while on the road from Edessa to Carrhae, now Harran in southern Turkey, where in 53BC the Romans had suffered a defeat at the hands of the Parthians. After stopping briefly to urinate, Caracalla was approached by a soldier, Justin Martialis, and stabbed. A Scythian bodyguard of Caracalla killed Martialis with his lance. The two Praetorian tribunes rushed to the emperor, as if to help him, and completed the assassination.

Martialis had been incensed by Caracalla&#x27;s refusal to grant him the position of centurion, and the praetorian prefect Macrinus, Caracalla&#x27;s successor, saw the opportunity to use Martialis to end Caracalla&#x27;s reign. In the immediate aftermath of Caracalla&#x27;s death, his murderer, Martialis, was killed as well. When Caracalla was murdered, Julia Domna was in Antioch sorting out correspondence, removing unimportant messages from the bunch so that when Caracalla returned, he would not be overburdened with duties. Three days later, Macrinus declared himself emperor with the support of the Roman army.

== Portraiture ==

Caracalla&#x27;s official portrayal as sole emperor marks a break from the detached images of the philosopher-emperors who preceded him: his close-cropped haircut is that of a soldier, his pugnacious scowl a realistic and threatening presence. This rugged soldier-emperor, an iconic archetype, was adopted by most of the following emperors, such as Maximinus Thrax, who were dependent on the support of the troops to rule the empire.

Herodian describes Caracalla as having preferred northern European clothing, &quot;Caracalla&quot; being the name of the short Gaulish cloak that he made fashionable, and he often wore a blond wig. Dio mentions that when Caracalla was a boy, he had a tendency to show an angry or even savage facial expression.

The way Caracalla wanted to be portrayed to his people can be seen through the many surviving busts and coins. Images of the young Caracalla cannot be clearly distinguished from his younger brother Geta. On the coins, Caracalla was shown laureate after becoming &quot;augustus&quot; in 197; Geta is bareheaded until he became &quot;augustus&quot; himself in 209. Between 209 and their father&#x27;s death in February211, both brothers are shown as mature young men who were ready to take over the empire.

Between the death of the father and the assassination of Geta towards the end of 211, Caracalla&#x27;s portrait remains static with a short full beard while Geta develops a long beard with hair strains like his father. The latter was a strong indicator of Geta&#x27;s effort to be seen as the true successor to their father, an effort that came to naught when he was murdered. Caracalla&#x27;s presentation on coins during the period of his co-reign with his father, from 198 to 210, are in broad terms in line with the third-century imperial representation; most coin types communicate military and religious messages, with other coins giving messages of &quot;saeculum aureum&quot; and virtues.

During Caracalla&#x27;s sole reign, from 212 to 217, a significant shift in representation took place. The majority of coins produced during this period made associations with divinity or had religious messages; others had non-specific and unique messages that were only circulated during Caracalla&#x27;s sole rule.

== Legacy ==

=== Damnatio memoriae ===
Caracalla was not subject to a proper &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; after his assassination; while the Senate disliked him, his popularity with the military prevented Macrinus and the Senate from openly declaring him to be a &quot;hostis&quot;. Macrinus, in an effort to placate the Senate, instead ordered the secret removal of statues of Caracalla from public view. After his death, the public made comparisons between him and other condemned emperors and called for the horse race celebrating his birthday to be abolished and for gold and silver statues dedicated to him to be melted down. These events were, however, limited in scope; most erasures of his name from inscriptions were either accidental or occurred as a result of re-use. Macrinus had Caracalla deified and commemorated on coins as &quot;Divus Antoninus&quot;. There does not appear to have been any intentional mutilation of Caracalla in any images that were created during his reign as sole emperor.
=== Classical portrayal ===
Caracalla is presented in the ancient sources of Cassius Dio, Herodian, and the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; as a cruel tyrant and savage ruler. This portrayal of Caracalla is only further supported by the murder of his brother Geta and the subsequent massacre of Geta&#x27;s supporters that Caracalla ordered. Alongside this, these contemporary sources present Caracalla as a &quot;soldier-emperor&quot; for his preference of the soldiery over the senators, a depiction that made him even less popular with the senatorial biographers. Dio explicitly presented Caracalla as an emperor who marched with the soldiers and behaved like a soldier. Dio also often referred to Caracalla&#x27;s large military expenditures and the subsequent financial problems this caused. These traits dominate Caracalla&#x27;s image in the surviving classical literature. The Baths of Caracalla are presented in classical literature as unprecedented in scale, and impossible to build if not for the use of reinforced concrete. The Edict of Caracalla, issued in 212, however, goes almost unnoticed in classical records.

The &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; is considered by historians as the least trustworthy for all accounts of events, historiography, and biographies among the ancient works and is full of fabricated materials and sources. The works of Herodian of Antioch are, by comparison, &quot;far less fantastic&quot; than the stories presented by the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;. Historian Andrew G. Scott suggests that Dio&#x27;s work is frequently considered the best source for this period. However, historian Clare Rowan questions Dio&#x27;s accuracy on the topic of Caracalla, referring to the work as having presented a hostile attitude towards Caracalla and thus needing to be treated with caution. An example of this hostility is found in one section where Dio notes that Caracalla is descended from three different races and that he managed to combine all of their faults into one person: the fickleness, cowardice, and recklessness of the Gauls, the cruelty and harshness of the Africans, and the craftiness that is associated with the Syrians. Despite this, the outline of events as presented by Dio are described by Rowan as generally accurate, while the motivations that Dio suggests are of questionable origin. An example of this is his presentation of the Edict of Caracalla; the motive that Dio appends to this event is Caracalla&#x27;s desire to increase tax revenue. Olivier Hekster, Nicholas Zair, and Rowan challenge this presentation because the majority of people who were enfranchised by the edict would have been poor. In her work, Rowan also describes Herodian&#x27;s depiction of Caracalla: more akin to a soldier than an emperor.

=== Medieval legends ===
Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s pseudohistorical &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot; makes Caracalla a king of Britain, referring to him by his actual name &quot;Bassianus&quot;, rather than by the nickname Caracalla. In the story, after Severus&#x27; death the Romans wanted to make Geta king of Britain, but the Britons preferred Bassianus because he had a British mother. The two brothers fought until Geta was killed and Bassianus succeeded to the throne, after which he ruled until he was overthrown and killed by Carausius. However, Carausius&#x27; revolt actually happened about seventy years after Caracalla&#x27;s death in 217.

=== Eighteenth-century artworks and the French Revolution ===

Caracalla&#x27;s memory was revived in the art of late eighteenth-century French painters. His tyrannical career became the subject of the work of several French painters such as Greuze, , David, Bonvoisin, J.-A.-C. Pajou, and Lethière. Their fascination with Caracalla was a reflection of the growing discontent of the French people with the monarchy. Caracalla&#x27;s visibility was influenced by the existence of several literary sources in French that included both translations of ancient works and contemporary works of the time. Caracalla&#x27;s likeness was readily available to the painters due to the distinct style of his portraiture and his unusual soldier-like choice of fashion that distinguished him from other emperors. The artworks may have served as a warning that absolute monarchy could become the horror of tyranny and that disaster could come about if the regime failed to reform. Art historian Susan Wood suggests that this reform was for the absolute monarchy to become a constitutional monarchy, as per the original goal of revolution, rather than the republic that it eventually became. Wood also notes the similarity between Caracalla and his crimes leading to his assassination and the eventual uprising against, and death of, King Louis XVI: both rulers had died as a result of their apparent tyranny.

=== Modern portrayal ===
Caracalla has had a reputation as being among the worst of Roman emperors, a perception that survives even into modern works. The art and linguistics historian John Agnew and the writer Walter Bidwell describe Caracalla as having an evil spirit, referring to the devastation he wrought in Alexandria. The Roman historian David Magie describes Caracalla, in the book &quot;Roman Rule in Asia Minor&quot;, as brutal and tyrannical and points towards psychopathy as an explanation for his behaviour. The historian Clifford Ando supports this description, suggesting that Caracalla&#x27;s rule as sole emperor is notable &quot;almost exclusively&quot; for his crimes of theft, massacre, and mismanagement.

18th-century historian Edward Gibbon, author of &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, takes Caracalla&#x27;s reputation, which he had received for the murder of Geta and subsequent massacre of Geta&#x27;s supporters, and applied it to Caracalla&#x27;s provincial tours, suggesting that &quot;every province was by turn the scene of his rapine and cruelty&quot;. Gibbon compared Caracalla to emperors such as Hadrian who spent their careers campaigning in the provinces and then to tyrants such as Nero and Domitian whose entire reigns were confined to Rome and whose actions only impacted upon the senatorial and equestrian classes residing there. Gibbon then concluded that Caracalla was &quot;the common enemy of mankind&quot;, as both Romans and provincials alike were subject to &quot;his rapine and cruelty&quot;.

This representation is questioned by the historian Shamus Sillar, who cites the construction of roads and reinforcement of fortifications in the western provinces, among other things, as being contradictory to the representation made by Gibbon of cruelty and destruction. The history professors Molefi Asante and Shaza Ismail note that Caracalla is known for the disgraceful nature of his rule, stating that &quot;he rode the horse of power until it nearly died of exhaustion&quot; and that though his rule was short, his life, personality, and acts made him a notable, though likely not beneficial, figure in the Roman Empire.

<doc id="49908" wikidata="Q364990" url="?curid=49908" title="Pat Robertson">
<text>Marion Gordon &quot;Pat&quot; Robertson (March 22, 1930 – June 8, 2023) was an American media mogul, televangelist, political commentator, presidential candidate, and charismatic minister. Robertson advocated a conservative Christian ideology and was known for his involvement in Republican Party politics. He was associated with the Charismatic movement within Protestant evangelicalism. He served as head of Regent University and of the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN).

Robertson&#x27;s career spanned over five decades, and was the founder of several organizations, including CBN, Regent University, Operation Blessing International Relief and Development Corporation, the International Family Entertainment Inc. (ABC Family Channel/Freeform), the American Center for Law &amp; Justice (ACLJ), the Founders Inn and Conference Center, and the Christian Coalition. Robertson was also a best-selling author and the host of &quot;The 700 Club&quot;, a Christian News and TV program broadcast live weekdays on Freeform (formerly ABC Family) from CBN studios, as well as on channels throughout the United States, and on CBN network affiliates worldwide. Robertson retired from &quot;The 700 Club&quot; in October 2021.

The son of U.S. Senator A. Willis Robertson, Robertson was a Southern Baptist and was active as an ordained minister with that denomination for many years, but held to a charismatic theology not traditionally common among Southern Baptists. He unsuccessfully campaigned to become the Republican nominee in the 1988 presidential election. As a result of his seeking political office, he never again served in an official role for any church. 

Robertson remained a controversial figure, especially known for evangelical religiocentrism. While he became a recognized and influential public voice for conservative Christianity in the U.S. and around the world, his opposition to various progressive causes, including LGBT rights, feminism, and the right to abortion, was frequently criticized.

==Early life==
Marion Gordon Robertson was born on March 22, 1930, in Lexington, Virginia, into a prominent political family, the younger of two sons. His parents were Absalom Willis Robertson (1887–1971), a conservative Democratic Senator, and Gladys Churchill (née Willis; 1897–1968), a housewife and a musician. At a young age, Robertson was nicknamed &#x27;Pat&#x27; by his six-year-old brother, Willis Robertson Jr., who enjoyed patting him on the cheeks when he was a baby while saying &quot;pat, pat, pat&quot;. Later, Robertson thought about which first name he would like people to use. He considered &quot;Marion&quot; to be effeminate, and &quot;M. Gordon&quot; to be affected, so he opted for his childhood nickname &quot;Pat&quot;.

When he was eleven, Robertson was enrolled in the preparatory McDonogh School outside Baltimore, Maryland. From 1940 until 1946, he attended The McCallie School in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he graduated with honors. He gained admission to Washington and Lee University, where he earned a B.A. in History, graduating magna cum laude. He was also a member of Phi Beta Kappa, the nation&#x27;s most prestigious academic honor society. He joined Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. Robertson said, &quot;Although I worked hard at my studies, my real major centered around lovely young ladies who attended the nearby girls schools.&quot;

In 1948, the draft was reinstated and Robertson was given the option of joining the U.S. Marine Corps or being drafted into the U.S. Army; he opted for the former. Robertson described his military service as follows: &quot;We did long, grueling marches to toughen the men, plus refresher training in firearms and bayonet combat.&quot; In the same year, he transferred to Korea, &quot;I ended up at the headquarters command of the First Marine Division,&quot; says Robertson. &quot;The Division was in combat in the hot and dusty, then bitterly cold portion of North Korea just above the 38th Parallel later identified as the &#x27;Punchbowl&#x27; and &#x27;Heartbreak Ridge&#x27;.&quot; For Robertson&#x27;s service in the Korean War, he was awarded three Battle Stars.

In 1986, former Republican Congressman Paul &quot;Pete&quot; McCloskey Jr., who served with Robertson in Camp Pendleton, wrote a public letter challenging Robertson&#x27;s record in the military. Robertson filed a libel suit against McCloskey but he dropped the case in 1988 in order to devote &quot;his full time and energies toward the successful attainment of the Republican nomination for the president of the United States.&quot;

Robertson was promoted to First Lieutenant in 1952 upon his return to the United States. He then went on to receive a law degree from Yale Law School in 1955, near the top of his class. However, he failed his first and only attempt at the New York bar exam necessary for admission to the New York State Bar Association, which did not deter Robertson because he never intended to practice law anyway. Shortly thereafter he underwent a religious conversion and decided against pursuing a career in business. Instead, Robertson attended The Biblical Seminary in New York, where he received a Master of Divinity degree in 1959. He became a born again Christian while having dinner at a restaurant in Philadelphia with author and World War II veteran, Cornelius Vanderbreggen. After his conversion, Robertson left the corporate world and went into ministry.

==Christian Broadcasting Network==

In 1956, Robertson met Dutch missionary Cornelius Vanderbreggen, who impressed Robertson both with his lifestyle and his message. Vanderbreggen quoted Proverbs (3:5, 6), &quot;Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths&quot;, which Robertson considered being the &quot;guiding principle&quot; of his life. In 1961, he was ordained as a Southern Baptist minister by Freemason Street Baptist Church in Norfolk, Virginia. 

In 1960, Robertson established the Christian Broadcasting Network in Virginia Beach, Virginia, by buying the license of a defunct UHF station in nearby Portsmouth. The station, with the call sign WYAH-TV, first broadcast on October 1, 1961. The network became known for producing the long-running TV series &quot;The 700 Club&quot;, starting in 1966, which Robertson served as a long time co-host. On April 29, 1977, CBN launched a religious cable network, the CBN Satellite Service, which eventually became The Family Channel. It was the first satellite television channel in America to connect to cable systems across the country. The venture became extremely lucrative, so Robertson spun off The Family Channel as a commercial entity that was sold to News Corporation for $1.9 billion in 1997.

In 1994, he endorsed the document &quot;Evangelicals and Catholics Together&quot;. Robertson announced his retirement at the age of 91 from &quot;The 700 Club&quot; in October 2021, on the sixtieth anniversary of the first telecast on October 1, 1961, of what eventually became CBN.

==Regent University==

Robertson founded CBN University, a private Christian university, in 1977 on CBN&#x27;s Virginia Beach campus. Since its founding, the university has established eight academic schools and offers associate, bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees in over 150 areas of study. It was renamed Regent University in 1990. According to the school&#x27;s catalog, &quot;a regent is one who represents Christ, our Sovereign, in whatever sphere of life he or she may be called to serve Him.&quot;

With more than 11,000 current students, Regent University has ranked the #1 Best Online Bachelor&#x27;s Program in Virginia for ten years in a row by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; 2022, as well as 2023 Best Graduate Schools-Law, Best Graduate Schools – Social Sciences and Humanities Doctoral Programs – Psychology, 2023 Best Graduate Schools – Public Affairs, and 2023 Best Education Schools by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. Robertson served as its chancellor and CEO.

Robertson was also founder and president of the American Center for Law &amp; Justice, a public interest law firm headquartered in Washington, D.C., associated with Regent University School of Law in Virginia Beach, Virginia, which defends constitutional freedoms and conservative Christian ideals. Critics have characterized Robertson as an advocate of dominionism.

==Operation Blessing==

Robertson&#x27;s Operation Blessing organization sent medical teams to developing countries to help people who had no access to medical care. In 1994, in the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide, Robertson solicited donations to provide medical supplies to refugees in neighboring Zaire (present-day Congo), where Robertson also had exploratory diamond mining operations. According to a 1999 article in The Virginian-Pilot, two Operation Blessing pilots who were interviewed alleged that the organization&#x27;s planes were used to haul diamond-mining equipment to Robertson&#x27;s mines in Zaire. Robertson denied the pilots&#x27; accounts.

In its 2021 ranking of &quot;100 Largest Charities&quot;, Forbes ranked Operation Blessing/CBN at #44, with a fundraising efficiency of 93% (percentage of donations left after fundraising expenses) and charitable commitment of 87% (percentage of expenses paid toward the stated mission compared to other costs).

==Other ventures==
Robertson was the founder and chairman of The Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) Inc., and founder of International Family Entertainment Inc., Regent University, Operation Blessing International Relief and Development Corporation, American Center for Law and Justice, The Flying Hospital, Inc., and several other organizations and broadcast entities. Robertson was the founder and co-chairman of International Family Entertainment Inc. (IFE).

Formed in 1990, IFE produced and distributed family entertainment and information programming worldwide. IFE&#x27;s principal business was The Family Channel, a satellite delivered cable-television network with 63 million U.S. subscribers. IFE, a publicly held company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, was sold in 1997 to Fox Kids Worldwide, Inc. for $1.9billion, whereupon it was renamed Fox Family Channel. Disney acquired FFC in 2001 and its name was changed again, to ABC Family. The network was renamed to Freeform on January 12, 2016, though Robertson&#x27;s sale of the channel continues to require Freeform to carry four hours of CBN/&quot;700 Club&quot; programming per weekday, along with CBN&#x27;s yearly telethon.

Robertson was a global businessman with media holdings in Asia, the United Kingdom, and Africa. He struck a deal with Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based General Nutrition Center to produce and market a weight-loss shake he created and promoted on &quot;The 700 Club&quot;.

In 1999, Robertson entered into a joint venture with the Bank of Scotland to provide financial services in the United States. However, the venture fell through as it was met with criticism from civil rights groups in the UK, owing to Robertson&#x27;s controversial views on homosexuality. The Bank was forced to cancel the deal when Robertson described Scotland as a &quot;dark land overrun by homosexuals&quot;.

While some have estimated his wealth to have been between$200million and $1 billion, Robertson claimed that these estimates were not based on any facts and were incorrect.

A June 2, 1999, article in &quot;The Virginian-Pilot&quot; alleged that Robertson had business dealings with Liberian president Charles Taylor, with whom Robertson, according to the article, negotiated a multimillion-dollar contract for gold mining operations in Liberia. Robertson denied any business dealings with Taylor, and he also denied ever speaking to President George W. Bush about Taylor&#x27;s alleged activities. On February 4, 2010, at his war crimes trial in the Hague, Taylor testified that Robertson was his main political ally in the U.S., while Robertson has denied ever meeting or speaking to Charles Taylor.

Beginning in the latter part of the 1990s, Robertson raced thoroughbred horses under the &quot;nom de course&quot; Tega Farm. His gelding named Tappat won the 1999 Walter Haight Handicap at Laurel Park and the 2000 Pennsylvania Governor&#x27;s Cup Handicap at Penn National Race Course. Following this success, Robertson paid $520,000 for a colt he named Mr. Pat. Trained by John Kimmel, Mr. Pat was not a successful runner. He was nominated for, but did not run in, the 2000 Kentucky Derby.

==Political career and activism==
Robertson was a past president of the Council for National Policy. In 1982, he served on the Victims of Crime Task Force for U.S. President Ronald Reagan. In Virginia, he served on the Board of the Virginia Economic Development Partnership and on the Governor&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisors. After his unsuccessful presidential campaign, Robertson started the Christian Coalition, a 1.7-million-member Christian right organization that campaigned mostly for conservative candidates. Billy McCormack, a Southern Baptist pastor in Shreveport, Louisiana, served as one of the four directors of the coalition as well as its vice president. The coalition was sued by the Federal Election Commission &quot;for coordinating its activities with Republican candidates for office in 1990, 1992 and 1994 and failing to report its expenditures,&quot; yet the complaint was dismissed by a federal judge. In March 1986, he told &quot;Israeli Foreign Affairs&quot; that South Africa was a major contributor to the Reagan administration&#x27;s efforts to help the anti-Sandinista forces.

In 1994, the Coalition was fined for &quot;improperly [aiding] then Representative Newt Gingrich (R-GA) and Oliver North, who was then the Republican Senate nominee in Virginia.&quot;

Robertson was a governing member of the Council for National Policy (CNP) and served on its Board of Governors in 1982, was the President of its Executive Committee from 1985 to 1986, and a member in 1984, 1988, and 1998.

On November 7, 2007, Robertson announced that he was endorsing Rudy Giuliani to be the Republican nominee in the 2008 Presidential election. Some social conservatives criticized Robertson&#x27;s endorsement of Giuliani, a pro-choice candidate who supported gay rights.

While usually associated with the political right, Robertson endorsed environmental causes. He appeared in a commercial with Al Sharpton, joking about this, and urging people to join the &quot;We Can Solve It&quot; campaign against global warming.

In January 2009, on a broadcast of &quot;The 700 Club&quot;, Robertson stated that he was &quot;adamantly opposed&quot; to the division of Jerusalem between Israel and the Palestinians. He also stated that Armageddon was &quot;not going to be fought at Megiddo&quot; but would be the &quot;battle of Jerusalem,&quot; when &quot;the forces of all nations come together and try to take Jerusalem away from the Jews. Jews are not going to give up Jerusalemthey shouldn&#x27;tand the rest of the world is going to insist they give it up.&quot; Robertson added that Jerusalem is a &quot;spiritual symbol that must not be given away&quot; because &quot;Jesus Christ the Messiah will come down to the part of Jerusalem that the Arabs want,&quot; and this would be &quot;not good.&quot;

Robertson repeatedly called for the legalization of cannabis, saying that it should be treated in a manner analogous to the regulation of alcoholic beverages and tobacco. Robertson stated that &quot;I just think it&#x27;s shocking how many of these young people wind up in prison and they get turned into hard-core criminals because they had a possession of a very small amount of controlled substance. The whole thing is crazy.&quot; In 2014, he turned against the legalization of cannabis, citing a need to protect children, whom he claimed were using cannabis at a higher rate in Colorado following legalization there.

===1988 presidential bid===


In September 1986, Robertson announced his intention to seek the Republican nomination for President of the United States. Robertson said he would pursue the nomination only if three million people signed up to volunteer for his campaign by September 1987. Three million responded, and by the time Robertson announced he would be running in September 1987, he also had raised millions of dollars for his campaign fund. He surrendered his ministerial credentials and turned leadership of CBN over to his son, Tim. In 1987, he left the Southern Baptist Convention to run.

Robertson ran on a standard conservative platform, and as a candidate he embraced the same policies as Ronald Reagan: lower taxes, a balanced budget, and a strong defense.

Robertson&#x27;s campaign achieved a strong second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses, ahead of Bush. He did poorly in the subsequent New Hampshire primary, however, and was unable to be competitive once the multiple-state primaries began. Robertson ended his campaign before the primaries were finished. His best finish was in Washington, winning the majority of caucus delegates.

==Personal life==
===Marriage and family===
In 1954, Robertson married Adelia &quot;Dede&quot; Elmer, a fashion model and beauty queen in the Miss Ohio State contest, who was studying for her masters in nursing at Yale University. She had also been a nursing student at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. They remained married until her death in 2022, and had four children, among them Gordon P. Robertson.

===Illness and death===
On August 11, 2017, Robertson was hospitalized after sustaining minor injuries in a fall from a horseback riding incident.

On February 2, 2018, Robertson suffered an embolic stroke at his home in Virginia Beach. A member of his family noticed his symptoms and alerted emergency medical personnel. He was then taken to the nearest stroke center where he was administered the clot-busting drug tPA. Robertson was responsive, awake, and moving all of his limbs about eighty minutes after his stroke began. He was discharged two days later and recovered at home. Following this incident, Robertson and his family thanked the paramedics and medical staff for their &quot;extraordinary care and rapid response.&quot; They also urged people to learn about stroke, its symptoms and treatments. Robertson resumed his hosting duties on &quot;The 700 Club&quot; on February 12, 2018.

In June 2019, Robertson was absent from &quot;The 700 Club&quot; for several days after he broke three ribs in a fall. Upon his return, Robertson described the experience as very painful but said &quot;Us old guys are tough, and we try to stay in there and keep on going.&quot; He then thanked viewers for their prayers.

On June 8, 2023, Robertson died at his home in Virginia Beach, Virginia, at the age of 93.

==Controversies==
As a commentator and minister, Robertson&#x27;s statements frequently generated controversy.

Robertson&#x27;s service as a minister included the belief in the healing power of God. He cautioned believers that some Protestant denominations may harbor the spirit of the Antichrist; denounced Hinduism as &quot;demonic&quot; and Islam as &quot;Satanic&quot;.

Robertson denounced left-wing views of feminism, activism regarding homosexuality, abortion, and liberal college professors. Critics claim Robertson had business dealings in Africa with former president of Liberia and convicted war criminal Charles Taylor, and former Zaire president Mobutu Sese Seko, both of whom had been globally denounced for claims of human rights violations. Robertson was criticized worldwide for his call for Hugo Chávez&#x27;s assassination, and for his remarks concerning Ariel Sharon&#x27;s ill health as an act of God.

During the week of September 11, 2001, Robertson interviewed Jerry Falwell, who expressed his own opinion that &quot;the ACLU has to take a lot of blame for this&quot; in addition to &quot;the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays, and the lesbians [who have] helped [the terror attacks of September 11th] happen.&quot; Robertson replied, &quot;I totally concur&quot;. Both evangelists were seriously criticized by President George W. Bush for their comments, for which Falwell later issued an apology.

Less than two weeks after Hurricane Katrina killed 1,836 people, Robertson implied on the September 12, 2005, broadcast of &quot;The 700 Club&quot; that the storm was God&#x27;s punishment in response to America&#x27;s abortion policy. He suggested that the September 11 attacks and the disaster in New Orleans &quot;could[...] be connected in some way&quot;.

In 2006, Robertson claimed to have leg pressed 2,000 lbs three years earlier at the age of 73. Strength training experts reacted with skepticism. CBN attributed Robertson&#x27;s energy and vitality to his &quot;age-defying protein shake.&quot;

In 2009, Robertson said that Islam is &quot;a violent political system bent on the overthrow of the governments of the world and world domination&quot;. He went on to elaborate that &quot;you&#x27;re dealing with not a religion, you&#x27;re dealing with a political system, and I think we should treat it as such, and treat its adherents as such as we would members of the communist party, members of some fascist group&quot;.

Robertson&#x27;s response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake also sparked worldwide condemnation. Robertson claimed that Haiti&#x27;s founders had sworn a &quot;pact to the Devil&quot; in order to liberate themselves from the French slave owners and indirectly attributed the earthquake to the consequences of the Haitian people being &quot;cursed&quot; for doing so. CBN later issued a statement saying that Robertson&#x27;s comments &quot;were based on the widely-discussed 1791 slave rebellion led by Dutty Boukman at Bois Caïman, where the slaves allegedly made a famous pact with the devil in exchange for victory over the French&quot;. Various figures in mainline and evangelical Christianity have on occasion disavowed some of Robertson&#x27;s remarks.

In March 2015, Robertson compared Buddhism to a disease on &quot;The 700 Club&quot;. The American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), a conservative Christian watchdog group Robertson founded to promote Christian prayer in public schools, called for a multi-pronged attack on mindfulness programs because &quot;they appear to be similar to Buddhist religious practices. Proponents of secular mindfulness say mindfulness is not a Buddhist practice; it is a contemplative practice used in religious traditions around the world by many different names.&quot;

==Publications==
Robertson&#x27;s book &quot;The New World Order&quot; (1991) became a &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller. A review by Ephraim Radner, an Episcopalian professor of theology, stated:
 In October 2003, Robertson was interviewed by author Joel Mowbray about his book &quot;Dangerous Diplomacy&quot;, a book critical of the United States Department of State. Robertson said that Americans could change American diplomacy by ridding America of a large part of the State Department.
