<text>A minor-planet group is a population of minor planets that share broadly similar orbits. Members are generally unrelated to each other, unlike in an asteroid family, which often results from the break-up of a single asteroid. It is customary to name a group of asteroids after the first member of that group to be discovered, which is often the largest.

== Groups out to the orbit of Earth ==

There are relatively few asteroids that orbit close to the Sun. Several of these groups are hypothetical at this point in time, with no members having yet been discovered; as such, the names they have been given are provisional.
* Vulcanoid asteroids are hypothetical asteroids that orbit entirely within the orbit of Mercury (have an aphelion of less than 0.3874 AU). A few searches for vulcanoids have been conducted but none have been discovered so far.
* ꞌAylóꞌchaxnim asteroids (previously named Vatira) are asteroids that orbit entirely within the orbit of Venus (have an aphelion of less than 0.718 AU). , one such asteroid is known: 594913 ꞌAylóꞌchaxnim.
* Atira asteroids (Apohele; Interior-Earth Objects) are a small group of known asteroids whose aphelion is less than 0.983 AU, meaning they orbit entirely within Earth&#x27;s orbit. The group is named after its first confirmed member, 163693 Atira. , the group consists of 22 members, 6 of which are numbered.
* Mercury-crosser asteroids having a perihelion smaller than Mercury&#x27;s 0.3075 AU.
* Venus-crosser asteroids having a perihelion smaller than Venus&#x27;s 0.7184 AU. This group includes the above Mercury-crossers (if their aphelion is greater than Venus&#x27;s perihelion. All known Mercury crossers satisfy this condition except ꞌAylóꞌchaxnim, which has an aphelion smaller than Venus&#x27;s perihelion and a perihelion slightly smaller than Mercury&#x27;s aphelion).
* Earth-crosser asteroids having a perihelion smaller than Earth&#x27;s 0.9833 AU. This group includes the above Mercury- and Venus-crossers, apart from the Apoheles. They are also divided into the
** Aten asteroids having a semi-major axis less than 1 AU, named after 2062 Aten.
** Apollo asteroids having a semi-major axis greater than 1 AU, named after 1862 Apollo.
* Arjuna asteroids are somewhat vaguely defined as having orbits similar to Earth&#x27;s; i.e. with an average orbital radius of around 1 AU and with low eccentricity and inclination. Due to the vagueness of this definition some asteroids belonging to the Atira, Amor, Apollo or Aten groups can also be classified as Arjunas. The term was introduced by Spacewatch and does not refer to an existing asteroid; examples of Arjunas include 1991 VG.
* Earth trojans are asteroids located in the Earth–Sun Lagrangian points and . Their location in the sky as observed from Earth&#x27;s surface would be fixed at about 60 degrees east and west of the Sun, and as people tend to search for asteroids at much greater elongations few searches have been done in these locations. The only known Earth trojans are and .
* Near-Earth asteroids is a catch-all term for asteroids whose orbit closely approaches that of Earth. It includes almost all of the above groups, as well as the Amor asteroids.

== Groups out to the orbit of Mars ==
* The Amor asteroids, named after 1221 Amor, are near-Earth asteroids that are not Earth-crossers, having a perihelion just outside the Earth&#x27;s orbit.
* Mars-crosser asteroids have orbits that cross that of Mars, but do not necessarily closely approach the Earth&#x27;s.
* Mars trojans follow or lead Mars on its orbit, at either of the two Lagrangian points 60° ahead () or behind (). As of November 2020, nine are known. The largest appears to be 5261 Eureka.
* Many of the Earth-, Venus-, and Mercury-crosser asteroids have aphelia greater than 1 AU.

==The asteroid belt==


The overwhelming majority of known asteroids have orbits lying between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, roughly between 2 and 4 AU. These could not form a planet due to the gravitational influence of Jupiter. Jupiter&#x27;s gravitational influence, through orbital resonance, clears Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt, first recognised by Daniel Kirkwood in 1874.

The region with the densest concentration (lying between the Kirkwood gaps at 2.06 and 3.27 AU, with eccentricities below about 0.3, and inclinations smaller than 30°) is called the asteroid belt. It can be further subdivided by the Kirkwood Gaps into the:
* Inner asteroid belt, inside of the strong Kirkwood gap at 2.50 AU due to the 3:1 Jupiter orbital resonance. The largest member is 4 Vesta.
** It apparently also includes a group called the main-belt I asteroids which have a semi-major axis between 2.3 AU and 2.5 AU and an inclination of less than 18°.
* Middle (or intermediate) asteroid belt, between the 3:1 and 5:2 Jupiter orbital resonances, the latter at 2.82 AU. The largest member is Ceres. This group is apparently split into the:
** Main-belt IIa asteroids which have a semi-major axis between 2.5 AU and 2.706 AU and an inclination less than 33°.
** Main-belt IIb asteroids which have a semi-major axis between 2.706 AU and 2.82 AU and an inclination less than 33°.
* Outer asteroid belt between the 5:2 and 2:1 Jupiter orbital resonances. The largest member is 10 Hygiea. This group is apparently split into the:
** Main-belt IIIa asteroids which have a semi-major axis between 2.82 AU and 3.03 AU, an eccentricity less than .35, and an inclination less than 30°.
** Main-belt IIIb asteroids which have a semi-major axis between 3.03 AU and 3.27 AU, an eccentricity less than .35, and an inclination less than 30°.

===Other groups out to the orbit of Jupiter===

There are a number of more or less distinct asteroid groups outside the asteroid belt, distinguished either by mean distance from the Sun, or particular combinations of several orbital elements:
* The Hungaria asteroids, with a mean orbital radius between 1.78 AU and 2 AU, an eccentricity less than 0.18, and inclination between 16° and 34°. Named after 434 Hungaria, these are just outside Mars&#x27;s orbit, and are possibly attracted by the 9:2 Jupiter resonance or the 3:2 Mars resonance.
* The Phocaea asteroids, with a mean orbital radius between 2.25 AU and 2.5 AU, an eccentricity greater than 0.1, and inclination between 18° and 32°. Some sources group the Phocaeas asteroids with the Hungarias, but the division between the two groups is real and caused by the 4:1 resonance with Jupiter. Named after 25 Phocaea.
* The Alinda asteroids have a mean orbital radius of 2.5 AU and an eccentricity between 0.4 and 0.65 (approximately). These objects are held by the 3:1 resonance with Jupiter and a 4:1 resonance with Earth. Many Alinda asteroids have perihelia very close to Earth&#x27;s orbit and can be difficult to observe for this reason. Alinda asteroids are &quot;not&quot; in stable orbits and eventually will collide either with Jupiter or terrestrial planets. Named after 887 Alinda.
* The Pallas family asteroids have a mean orbital radius between 2.7 and 2.8 AU and an inclination between 30° and 38°. Named after 2 Pallas.
* The Griqua asteroids have an orbital radius between 3.1 AU and 3.27 AU and an eccentricity greater than 0.35. These asteroids are in stable 2:1 libration with Jupiter, in high-inclination orbits. There are about 5 to 10 of these known so far, with 1362 Griqua and 8373 Stephengould the most prominent.
* The Cybele asteroids have a mean orbital radius between 3.27 AU and 3.7 AU, an eccentricity less than 0.3, and an inclination less than 30°. This group appears to cluster around the 7:4 resonance with Jupiter. Named after 65 Cybele.
* Hilda asteroids have a mean orbital radius between 3.7 AU and 4.2 AU, an eccentricity greater than 0.07, and an inclination less than 20°. These asteroids are in a 3:2 resonance with Jupiter. Named after 153 Hilda.
* The Thule asteroids are in a 4:3 resonance with Jupiter and the group is known to consist of 279 Thule, , and .
* The Jupiter trojans have a mean orbital radius between 5.05 AU and 5.4 AU, and lie in elongated, curved regions around the two Lagrangian points 60° ahead and behind of Jupiter. The leading point, , is called the Greek camp and the trailing point is called the Trojan camp, after the two opposing camps of the legendary Trojan War; with one exception apiece, objects in each node are named for members of that side of the conflict. 617 Patroclus in the Trojan camp and 624 Hektor in the Greek camp are &quot;misplaced&quot; in the enemy camps.

There is a forbidden zone between the Hildas and the Trojans (roughly 4.05 AU to 4.94 AU). Aside from 279 Thule and 228 objects in mostly unstable-looking orbits, Jupiter&#x27;s gravity has swept everything out of this region.

== Groups beyond the orbit of Jupiter ==

Most of the minor planets beyond the orbit of Jupiter are believed to be composed of ices and other volatiles. Many are similar to comets, differing only in that the perihelia of their orbits are too distant from the Sun to produce a significant tail.
* The Damocloid asteroids, also known as the &quot;Oort cloud group,&quot; are named after 5335 Damocles. They are defined to be objects that have &quot;fallen in&quot; from the Oort cloud, so their aphelia are generally still out past Uranus, but their perihelia are in the inner Solar System. They have high eccentricities and sometimes high inclinations, including retrograde orbits. The definition of this group is somewhat fuzzy, and may overlap significantly with comets.
* The Centaurs have a mean orbital radius roughly between 5.4 AU and 30 AU. They are currently believed to be trans-Neptunian objects that &quot;fell in&quot; after encounters with gas giants. The first of these to be identified was 2060 Chiron (944 Hidalgo was discovered before, but not identified as a distinct orbital class).

== Groups at or beyond the orbit of Neptune ==
* The Neptune trojans as of February 2020 consist of 29 objects. The first one to be discovered was .
* Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) are anything with a mean orbital radius greater than 30 AU. This classification includes the Kuiper-belt objects (KBOs), the scattered disc, and the Oort cloud.
** Kuiper-belt objects extend from roughly 30 AU to 50 AU and are broken into the following subcategories:
*** Resonant objects occupy orbital resonances with Neptune, excluding the 1:1 resonance of the Neptune trojans. 
****Plutinos are by far the most common resonant KBOs and are in a 2:3 resonance with Neptune, just like Pluto. The perihelion of such an object tends to be close to Neptune&#x27;s orbit (much as happens with Pluto), but when the object comes to perihelion, Neptune alternates between being 90 degrees ahead of and 90 degrees behind of the object, so there&#x27;s no chance of a collision. The MPC defines any object with a mean orbital radius between 39 AU and 40.5 AU to be a plutino. 90482 Orcus and 28978 Ixion are among the brightest known.
**** Other resonances. There are several known objects in the 1:2 resonance, dubbed &quot;twotinos&quot;, with a mean orbital radius of 47.7 AU and an eccentricity of 0.37. There are several objects in the 2:5 (mean orbital radius of 55 AU), 4:7, 4:5, 3:10, 3:5, and 3:4 resonances, among others. The largest in the 2:5 resonance is , and the largest in the 3:10 resonance is 225088 Gonggong.
*** Classical Kuiper-belt objects, also known as cubewanos (after 15760 Albion, which had the provisional designation from its 1992 discovery to its 2018 naming), have a mean orbital radius between approximately 40.5 AU and 47 AU. Cubewanos are objects in the Kuiper belt that didn&#x27;t get scattered and didn&#x27;t get locked into a resonance with Neptune. The largest is .
** Scattered disc objects (SDOs) typically have, unlike cubewanos and resonant objects, high-inclination, high-eccentricity orbits with perihelia that are still not too far from Neptune&#x27;s orbit. They are assumed to be objects that encountered Neptune and were &quot;scattered&quot; out of their originally more circular orbits close to the ecliptic. The most massive known dwarf planet, Eris, belongs to this category.
*** Detached objects (extended scattered disk) with generally highly elliptical, very large orbits of up to a few hundred AU and a perihelion too far from Neptune&#x27;s orbit for any significant interaction to occur. A more typical member of the extended disk is .
****Sednoids have perihelia very far removed from the orbit of Neptune. This group is named after the best-known member, 90377 Sedna. As of 2020, only 4 objects in this category have been identified, but it is suspected that there are many more.
**The Oort cloud is a hypothetical cloud of comets with a mean orbital radius between approximately 50,000 AU and 100,000 AU. No Oort-cloud objects have been detected; the existence of this classification is only inferred from indirect evidence. Some astronomers have tentatively associated 90377 Sedna with the inner Oort cloud.

<doc id="47147" wikidata="Q234754" url="?curid=47147" title="Shirley Bassey">
<text>Dame Shirley Veronica Bassey (; born 8 January 1937) is a Welsh singer. Known for her career longevity, powerful voice and recording the theme songs to three James Bond films, the only artist to perform more than one, Bassey is one of the most popular vocalists in Britain.

Born in Cardiff, Bassey began performing as a teenager in 1953. In 1959, she became the first Welsh person to gain a number-one single on the UK Singles Chart. In the following decades, Bassey amassed 27 top 40 hits in the UK, including two number ones (&quot;As I Love You&quot; and the double A-side &quot;Climb Ev&#x27;ry Mountain&quot;/&quot;Reach for the Stars&quot;) plus a number one on the Dance Chart (&quot;History Repeating&quot;). She became well known for recording theme songs of the James Bond films &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964), &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; (1971), and &quot;Moonraker&quot; (1979).

Bassey has had numerous BBC television specials and hosted her own variety series, &quot;Shirley Bassey&quot;. In 2011, BBC aired the television film &quot;Shirley&quot;, based on Bassey&#x27;s life and career. Since making her first appearance at the Royal Albert Hall in 1971, she has performed at the venue 45 times. Bassey received the first award for Best British Female Solo Artist at the 1st Brit Awards in 1977. She was appointed a Dame in 1999 for services to the performing arts. In 2003, she was ranked among the &quot;100 Great Black Britons&quot;. Her song &quot;Goldfinger&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008. She has influenced many other singers, including Aretha Franklin.

In a career spanning over 70 years, Bassey has sold over 140 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling female artists of all time. She is the first woman in history to claim a Top 40 album in seven consecutive decades in the United Kingdom.

==Early life==
Shirley Veronica Bassey was born the sixth and youngest child of Henry Bassey and Eliza Jane Start on Bute Street in Tiger Bay, Cardiff. She grew up in the nearby community of Splott. Her father was Nigerian, and her English mother came from New Marske, North Yorkshire.

Two of her mother&#x27;s four children from previous relationships lived in the Bassey household. Bassey&#x27;s mother listed her first husband, Alfred Metcalfe, as her own father in the registry of her marriage to Henry Bassey, giving rise to speculation that this marriage was bigamous in the absence of a prior divorce. Eliza and Henry&#x27;s second child died in infancy, so Shirley was born into a household of three sisters, two half-sisters, and one brother.

Teachers and students alike at Moorland Road School noticed Bassey&#x27;s strong voice but gave the pre-teen little encouragement: &quot;everyone told me to shut up. Even in the school choir the teacher kept telling me to back off till I was singing in the corridor!&quot; A classmate recalled her singing the refrain &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Lovin&#x27; Dat Man&quot; from &quot;Show Boat&quot; with such feeling that she made their teacher uncomfortable. She left Splott secondary modern school at age 14 to work at Curran Steels and, in the evenings and weekends, to sing in local pubs and clubs.

==Career==

===1950s===
In 1953, Bassey signed her first professional contract, touring with the variety show &quot;Memories of Jolson&quot;, a musical based on the life of Al Jolson. On 17 December 1953, Bassey signed a contract with Columbia Productions for two performances at the salary of £10. Her next professional engagement was in the touring show &quot;Hot from Harlem&quot;, in which she and other mixed-race Cardiff performers played Black Americans in 1954. A review of the show in March 1954 included: &quot;Shirley Bassey, an attractive young singer, is an asset to the show.&quot; Later that year, Bassey gave birth to her daughter Sharon, while staying with her sister Ella in London.

While performing in Jersey, Bassey met her first manager, Mike Sullivan. In 1955, Bassey toured various theatres until she was noticed by the impresario Jack Hylton at the Astor Club in September 1955. He invited her to feature in Al Read&#x27;s &quot;Such Is Life&quot;, which opened on 14 December 1955 at the Adelphi Theatre in London&#x27;s West End. In the show, which ran until 3 November 1956, she featured the song &quot;Burn My Candle&quot;, leading one reviewer to say that she had nearly stopped the show with the song &quot;which brought outraged mutters, then roars of shamefaced applause.&quot; During the show&#x27;s run, Philips record producer Johnny Franz spotted her on television, was impressed, and offered her a recording deal. Bassey recorded her first single, &quot;Burn My Candle&quot;, the song she had featured in &quot;Such is Life&quot;, and this was released in February 1956. The cabaret-style song was banned by the BBC because the lyrics were considered too suggestive. More singles followed, and in February 1957, Bassey had her first hit with &quot;The Banana Boat Song&quot;, which reached No. 8 in the UK Singles Chart.

Following a successful run at the Café de Paris, London, Bassey made her American stage début in Las Vegas at El Rancho Vegas in February 1957. Following on from Las Vegas, Bassey opened at Ciro&#x27;s on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood on 15 February 1957. She also recorded under the direction of American producer Mitch Miller in New York City for the Columbia Records label (which at the time had a distribution deal with Philips), producing the single &quot;If I Had a Needle and Thread&quot; b/w &quot;Tonight My Heart She Is Crying&quot;. On her return to the UK in April 1957, she starred in &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot; for the first time on 28 April 1957.

In mid-1958, Bassey recorded two singles that would become classics in the Bassey catalogue. &quot;As I Love You&quot; was released as the B-side of another ballad, &quot;Hands Across the Sea&quot;; it did not sell well at first but, after another appearance at the London Palladium on 30 November, sales began to pick up. In January 1959, &quot;As I Love You&quot; reached number-one and stayed there for four weeks; it was the first number-one single by a Welsh artist. While &quot;As I Love You&quot; climbed the charts, so did Bassey&#x27;s recording of &quot;Kiss Me, Honey Honey, Kiss Me&quot; and both records would end up occupying the top 3 at the same time. Having been with Decca Records for four years, Bassey then signed to EMI&#x27;s Columbia label on 20 April 1959. Her first album for Columbia, &quot;The Fabulous Shirley Bassey&quot;, was later released and reached. No. 12 on the UK Albums Chart.

===1960s===
Between 1960 and 1961, Bassey had four Top 10 hits in the UK. Her 1960 recording of &quot;As Long As He Needs Me&quot; from Lionel Bart&#x27;s &quot;Oliver!&quot; peaked at No. 2,and had a chart run of 30 weeks. She made her American television début on 13 November 1960, when she performed on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. In 1961, the double A-side &quot;Reach for the Stars&quot;/&quot;Climb Ev&#x27;ry Mountain&quot; reached number-one. Bassey&#x27;s version of &quot;As Long as He Needs Me&quot; reached No. 2. Her single &quot;I&#x27;ll Get By&quot; peaked at No. 10. Bassey&#x27;s rendition of &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Know&quot; was one of the UK&#x27;s top hits in 1961, reaching No. 6 on the charts. She began to gain recognition in the American market and signed to United Artists Records in August 1961. The following month she began a five-week engagement at the Persian Room inside New York&#x27;s Plaza Hotel.

Bassey&#x27;s collaboration with Nelson Riddle and his orchestra, the album &quot;Let&#x27;s Face the Music&quot; (1962), reached No. 12 in the UK album chart; and the single, &quot;What Now My Love&quot; made it to No. 5 in 1962. Her cover version of the Ben E. King hit &quot;I (Who Have Nothing)&quot; reached No. 6 in 1963. In January 1963, Bassey performed at a gala commemorating the second anniversary of President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s inauguration in Washington, D.C. In March 1963, she appeared on the cover of &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine. Bassey made her Carnegie Hall debut on 15 February 1964. The complete concert recording was not released until it was included in the EMI compilation &quot;The EMU/UA Years 1959–1979&quot; in 1994.

In 1965, Bassey enjoyed her only Top 40 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with the title song of the James Bond film, &quot;Goldfinger&quot;. The single &quot;Goldfinger&quot; was released in the US in January 1965, peaking at No 8. The original soundtrack for &quot;Goldfinger&quot; hit number-one in the US that year. The &quot;Goldfinger&quot; theme song had a lasting impact on her career. In the sleeve notes for Bassey&#x27;s &quot;25th Anniversary Album&quot; (1978), Peter Clayton noted that: &quot;Acceptance in America was considerably helped by the enormous popularity of (&quot;Goldfinger&quot;)...But she had actually established herself there as early as 1961, in cabaret in New York. She was also a success in Las Vegas...&#x27;I suppose I should feel hurt that I&#x27;ve never been really big in America on record since &quot;Goldfinger&quot;...But, concertwise, I always sell out.&#x27;...&quot;

Her live 1965 album &quot;Shirley Bassey at the Pigalle&quot;, recorded during a sold-out run at the Pigalle in London, peaked at No. 15 on the UK album chart. Also in 1965, she sang the title song for the James Bond spoof &quot;The Liquidator.&quot; Bassey recorded a song for the next Bond film, &quot;Thunderball&quot; (1965). &quot;Mr Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot; was not used in the movie, although the film&#x27;s score follows its melodic theme. Written by John Barry and Leslie Bricusse, &quot;Mr Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot; was re-recorded by American singer Dionne Warwick, and then rejected in favor of a new song, &quot;Thunderball&quot;, hastily written by Barry and given to Welsh singer Tom Jones after the film&#x27;s producers decided the song over the opening credits must feature the film&#x27;s title.

In the aftermath of &quot;Goldfinger&quot; her UK sales started to falter as well: only two of her singles would enter the UK top 40 from 1966 to 1970. Her first album on United Artists, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Song for You&quot; (1966), spent one week on the chart. From 1966 to 1970, only two albums would chart, one of those a compilation. One of her best-known singles, &quot;Big Spender&quot; was released in 1967, charting just short of the UK top 20.

Bassey began to live as a tax exile in 1968, during a period of very high income tax, and was unable to work in Britain for almost two years. In 1969, she appeared in NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Spring Thing,&quot; a musical television special hosted by Bobbie Gentry and Noel Harrison. Guests included were Goldie Hawn, Meredith MacRae, Irwin C. Watson, Rod McKuen, and Harpers Bizarre.

===1970s===

Bassey&#x27;s UK comeback came in 1970 leading to one of the most successful periods of her career. Starting the year with a BBC Television &#x27;Special&#x27;, &quot;The Young Generation Meet Shirley Bassey&quot;, recorded in Sweden and shown on BBC1 on 18 March. She returned to the UK with a record-breaking run of performances at the Talk of the Town nightclub. Also that year, her album &quot;Something&quot; was released, and showcased a new Bassey style, a shift from traditional pop to more contemporary songs and arrangements (the eponymous single was more successful in the UK charts than the original recording by The Beatles) – although Bassey would never completely abandon that which had been her forte: standards, show tunes, and torch songs.

Her song &quot;Something&quot; was also a top 10 US hit on the Adult Contemporary chart. Other singles of this period included the hit &quot;Never Never Never&quot;, an English version of the Italian &quot;Grande grande grande&quot;, reaching the top 10 in the US Adult Contemporary Chart, the UK top 10 and number one in Australia and South Africa.

Returning to the James Bond franchise, she recorded the theme song for &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; (1971). Bassey appeared on the &quot;Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show&quot;, broadcast on Christmas Day in 1971.

Bassey was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on two occasions: firstly, in November 1972 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at Heathrow Airport, and then in January 1993, when Michael Aspel surprised her at the curtain call of a sell-out concert at the Royal Albert Hall.

Bassey recorded a series of successful albums on the United Artists label, including: &quot;Something Else&quot; (1971); &quot;And I Love You So&quot; (1972); &quot;I Capricorn&quot; (1972); &quot;Never Never Never&quot; (1973); &quot;Good, Bad but Beautiful&quot; (1975); &quot;Love, Life and Feelings&quot; (1976); &quot;You Take My Heart Away&quot; (1977) and &quot;Yesterdays&quot; (1978). Additionally, two of Bassey&#x27;s earlier LPs also entered the charts in the &#x27;70s: &quot;And We Were Lovers&quot; (1967, re-issued as &quot;Big Spender&quot;), and &quot;Let&#x27;s Face the Music&quot; (1962, re-issued as &quot;What Now My Love&quot;). Two compilations, &quot;The Shirley Bassey Singles Album&quot; (1975) and &quot;25th Anniversary Album&quot; (1978), both made the top three of the UK charts: &quot;The Shirley Bassey Singles Album&quot;, her highest-charting album, reached number two and earned a gold disc, and the &quot;25th Anniversary Album&quot; eventually went platinum.

Between 1970 and 1979, Bassey had 18 hit albums in the UK Albums Chart. Her album &quot;The Magic Is You&quot; (1979) featured a portrait by the photographer Francesco Scavullo. In 1973, her sold-out concerts at New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall were recorded and released as a two-LP set, &quot;Shirley Bassey: Live at Carnegie Hall&quot;; this album reached No. 20 on the Billboard R&amp;B album chart.

In 1976, Bassey starred in the six-episode &quot;Shirley Bassey&quot; show, the first of her television programmes for the BBC, followed by a second series of six episodes in 1979. The final show of the first series was nominated for the Golden Rose of Montreux in 1977. The series featured guests including Neil Diamond, Michel Legrand, The Three Degrees and Dusty Springfield and featured Bassey in various international locations as well as in the television studio. In 1978, Bassey pleaded guilty to being drunk and disorderly &quot;after shouting abuse in the street and pushing a policeman&quot;. In 1979, Bassey recorded the title theme song for the Bond film, &quot;Moonraker&quot;.

===1980s===
Throughout most of the 1980s, Bassey focused on charitable work and performing occasional concert tours throughout Europe, Australia, and the United States. She had ended her contract with United Artists, whose former record division was now part of EMI, and began what she referred to as &quot;semi-retirement&quot;. Bassey recorded an album entitled &quot;All by Myself&quot; (1982) and made a TV special for Thames Television called &quot;A Special Lady&quot; with guest Robert Goulet. Around this time she recorded a duet with the French film actor Alain Delon, &quot;Thought I&#x27;d Ring You&quot; (1983). Bassey was now recording far less often but an album of her most famous songs, &quot;I Am What I Am&quot; (1984), was recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) conducted by Carl Davis. This was followed by a single and video to support the London Tourist Board, &quot;There&#x27;s No Place Like London&quot; (1986), which was co-written by Lynsey de Paul and Gerard Kenny. She recorded an album of James Bond themes, &quot;The Bond Collection&quot; in 1987, but was apparently unhappy with the results so she declined to release it. (Five years later it was released anyway, Bassey sued in court, and all unsold copies were withdrawn.)

Bassey provided vocals for Swiss artists Yello on &quot;The Rhythm Divine&quot; (1987), a song co-written by Scottish singer Billy Mackenzie. An album sung entirely in Spanish, &quot;La Mujer&quot; was released in 1989.

===1990s===
Bassey had started working with a vocal coach, a former opera singer, and her album &quot;Keep the Music Playing&quot; (1991) displayed a grand, operatic pop style on several songs (perhaps also influenced by her album with the LSO seven years earlier).

EMI released the five-CD box set &quot;Bassey – The EMI/UA Years 1959–1979&quot; in 1994. The accompanying booklet opened with a poem by Marc Almond. Bassey collaborated with Chris Rea in the film &quot;La Passione&quot; (1996), appearing in the film as herself and releasing the single &quot;&#x27;Disco&#x27; La Passione&quot;. The remix of this single charted just outside the UK top 40. Bassey&#x27;s &quot;History Repeating&quot; (1997), written for her by the Propellerheads, reached number one on the UK Dance Chart, and number 10 on the US Dance Chart. The liner notes of the Propellerheads&#x27; album &quot;Decksandrumsandrockandroll&quot; included the lines: &quot;We would like to extend our maximum respect to Shirley Bassey for honouring us with her performance. We are still in shock...&quot; Bassey celebrated her 60th birthday in 1997 with two open-air concerts, at Castle Howard and Althorp Park, and another TV special. The resulting live album &quot;The Birthday Concert&quot; received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance. On 7 October 1998 in Egypt, Bassey performed for a benefit at an open-air concert close to the Sphinx and the Great Pyramid. Bassey played the Friday night at Henley Festival in 1984.

Bassey was sued in a breach of contract case in 1998 by her former personal assistant, who also accused Bassey of hitting her and making an ethnic slur. Bassey won the case. The episode was lampooned by Alexander Baron in his one-act play &quot;The Trial of Shirley Bassey&quot;. The following year, she performed the official song for the rugby World Cup, &quot;World in Union&quot;, with Bryn Terfel at the opening ceremony at The Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, wearing a gown based on the Welsh flag. Their single made the top 40, and Bassey contributed two more songs to the official album &quot;Land of My Fathers&quot;, which reached number one on the UK compilations chart, and went silver.

===2000s===

Bassey continued to perform at various high profile events. In 2001, she was principal artiste at the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s 80th birthday celebration. On 3 June 2002, she was one of a line-up of artists including Elton John, Paul McCartney and Tom Jones who performed at the Queen&#x27;s 50th Jubilee Party at Buckingham Palace.

Bassey celebrated 50 years in show business in 2003 with the release of the CD &quot;Thank You for the Years&quot;, which was another top 20 album. A gala charity auction of her stage costumes at Christie&#x27;s, &quot;Dame Shirley Bassey: 50 Years of Glittering Gowns&quot;, raised £250,000 (US$500,000) for the Dame Shirley Bassey Scholarship at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama and the Noah&#x27;s Ark Children&#x27;s Hospital Appeal. Bassey topped the bill at the 2005 Royal Variety Performance, introducing her new song &quot;The Living Tree&quot;.

Two popular &quot;Audiences with Shirley Bassey&quot; have aired on British television: one in 1995, which attracted more than 10 million viewers in the UK, and a second, broadcast in 2006. Bassey returned to perform in five arenas around the UK in June the same year, culminating at Wembley. She also performed a concert in front of 10,000 people at the Bryn Terfel Faenol Festival in North Wales broadcast by BBC Wales. Marks &amp; Spencer signed her for their Christmas 2006 James Bond–style television advertising campaign. Bassey was seen in a glamorous ice palace singing a cover version of Pink&#x27;s song &quot;Get the Party Started&quot;, wearing an M&amp;S gown.

&quot;The Living Tree&quot;, written, produced, and originally recorded by the group Never the Bride, was released as a single on 23 April 2007, marking Bassey&#x27;s 50th anniversary in the UK Singles Chart, and the record for the longest span of top-40 hits in UK chart history. Bassey performed a 45-minute set at the 2007 Glastonbury Festival wearing a pink Julien Macdonald dress, and customised Wellington boots. A new album, &quot;Get the Party Started&quot;, was subsequently released on 25 June 2007 and entered the UK Albums Chart at number six. The single of the title song reached number 3 on the US Dance Chart. The same year, Bassey performed &quot;Big Spender&quot; with Elton John at his annual White Tie and Tiara Ball to raise money for The Elton John AIDS Foundation. In 2007, Bassey performed in &quot;Fashion Rocks&quot; in aid of The Prince&#x27;s Trust at the Royal Albert Hall.
Bassey was rushed to hospital in Monaco on 23 May 2008 to have an emergency operation on her stomach after complaining of abdominal pains. She was forced to pull out of the Nelson Mandela 90th Birthday Tribute concert because of her illness. A biography of Bassey, &quot;Diamond Diva&quot;, was published in 2008.

Bassey recorded the album &quot;The Performance&quot; (2009), with James Bond composer David Arnold as producer. A number of artists wrote songs expressly for her, including Manic Street Preachers, Gary Barlow, Tom Baxter, KT Tunstall, Pet Shop Boys, Nick Hodgson of the Kaiser Chiefs, John Barry and Don Black. Bassey headlined at the BBC Electric Proms on 23 October 2009, in her only full live set of 2009.

==Personal life==

===Marriages===
Bassey&#x27;s first marriage was to Kenneth Hume in 1961. The couple separated in 1964 and divorced in 1965 in the wake of Bassey&#x27;s affair with actor Peter Finch. She then announced to the press that she and Finch would not be marrying, telling the press: &quot;It simply wouldn&#x27;t work out. Just know I am not ready for marriage to anyone. I feel I have to be free.&quot; A year later, Hume sued Finch and another man, John McAuliffe, for being &quot;indiscreet&quot; with Bassey. Both Finch and McAuliffe were cited as co-respondents in the Hume–Bassey divorce. For her part, Bassey was named as co-respondent in 1965 when Finch&#x27;s wife, South African actress Yolande Turner, divorced him.

From 1968 until they divorced in 1979, Bassey was married to Sergio Novak, the assistant manager of the Excelsior Hotel in Venice. During this time, Novak was Bassey&#x27;s manager, and they adopted Mark, her grand-nephew.

===Children===
The fathers of Bassey&#x27;s two daughters, Sharon Bassey (a.k.a. Sharon Novak, born 1954) and Samantha Bassey (a.k.a. Samantha Novak, born 1963), are unknown. Bassey had Sharon at the age of 17 and her sister Ella raised her as her own daughter until the 1960s. Bassey&#x27;s first husband suggested that Samantha, born during the couple&#x27;s marriage, was the result of an affair between Bassey and Peter Finch.

In 1985, Samantha, age 21, was found dead in the River Avon in Bristol. Bassey has always maintained that the death of her daughter was not a suicide. On 24 March 2010, Avon and Somerset Police confirmed they were undertaking fresh inquiries into the death and specifically claimed that the convicted killer Michael Moffat was involved in her death. However, in October 2010 it was reported that the investigation had come to an end, concluding that there was &quot;no evidence of any criminal act involved&quot; in Novak&#x27;s death. The ordeal of losing her daughter caused Bassey to temporarily lose her voice.

In a 2009 interview, Bassey stated that she and her son, Mark, had reconciled. Bassey has four grandsons through her surviving daughter, Sharon Novak. Bassey resides in Monaco.

In 2018, Bassey reported that she had a great-granddaughter.

<text>Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson (; born March 28, 1941, as Jeffrey Lloyd Masson) is an American author. Masson is best known for his conclusions about Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis. In his &quot;The Assault on Truth&quot; (1984), Masson argues that Freud may have abandoned his seduction theory because he feared that granting the truth of his female patients&#x27; claims (that they had been sexually abused) as children would hinder the acceptance of his psychoanalytic methods. Masson is a veganism advocate and has written about animal rights.

==Early life==
Jeffrey Masson is the son of Jacques Masson, a Frenchman of Bukharian Jewish ancestry, and Diana (Dina) Zeiger from an Ashkenazi strict Orthodox Jewish family. Both of his parents were followers of the guru Paul Brunton. Masson&#x27;s mother later became a follower of mystic and philosopher John Levy. During the 1940s and 1950s, Brunton often lived with them, eventually designating Masson as his heir apparent. In 1956, Diana and Jacques Masson moved to Uruguay because Brunton believed that a third world war was imminent. Jeffrey and his sister Linda followed in 1959.

===Studies===
At Brunton&#x27;s urging, Masson went to Harvard University to study Sanskrit. While at Harvard, Masson became disillusioned with Brunton. Brunton and his influence on the Masson family form the subject of Masson&#x27;s autobiographical book &quot;My Father&#x27;s Guru: A Journey Through Spirituality and Disillusion&quot;. Harvard University granted Masson a B.A. in 1964 and a PhD with Honors in 1970. His degrees were in Sanskrit and Indian Studies. While undertaking his PhD, Masson also studied, supported by fellowships, at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, the University of Calcutta, and the University of Poona.

==Career==
Masson taught Sanskrit and Indian Studies at the University of Toronto, 1969–80, reaching the rank of Professor. He has also held short term appointments at Brown University, the University of California, and the University of Michigan. From 1981 to 1992, he was a Research Associate, Department of South and Southeast Asian Studies, at the University of California, Berkeley. He is currently an Honorary Fellow in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Auckland in New Zealand.

== Views on Freud&#x27;s seduction theory ==
In 1970, Masson began studying to become a psychoanalyst at the Toronto Psychoanalytic Institute, completing a full clinical training course in 1978. His training analyst was Irvine Schiffer, a well-known Toronto analyst and author of books on the unconscious aspects of charisma and time. In 1990 Masson published an autobiographical book in which he accused Schiffer of cursing, being constantly late for sessions, and intimidating Masson when the latter complained about this issue. Schiffer denied it and debated Masson on the Canadian television program &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot;.

During this time, Masson befriended the psychoanalyst Kurt Eissler and became acquainted with Sigmund Freud&#x27;s daughter Anna Freud. Eissler designated Masson to succeed him as Director of the Sigmund Freud Archives after his and Anna Freud&#x27;s deaths. Masson learned German and studied the history of psychoanalysis. In 1980 Masson was appointed Projects Director of the Freud Archives, with full access to Freud&#x27;s correspondence and other unpublished papers. While perusing this material, Masson concluded that Freud might have rejected the seduction theory in order to advance the cause of psychoanalysis and to maintain his own place within the psychoanalytic inner circle, after a hostile response from the renowned sex-pathologist Richard von Krafft-Ebing and the rest of the Vienna Psychiatric Society in 1896 — &quot;an icy reception from the jackasses,&quot; was the way Freud described it later to Fliess.

In 1981, Masson&#x27;s controversial conclusions were discussed in a series of &quot;New York Times&quot; articles by Ralph Blumenthal, to the dismay of the psychoanalytic establishment. Masson was subsequently dismissed from his position as project director of the Freud Archives and stripped of his membership in psychoanalytic professional societies. Masson was defended by Alice Miller
and Muriel Gardiner (&quot;While striving not to take sides,&quot; Gardiner said, &quot;I consider him a good and energetic worker and a worthwhile scholar&quot;).

Masson later wrote several books critical of psychoanalysis, including &quot;The Assault on Truth: Freud&#x27;s Suppression of the Seduction Theory&quot;. In the introduction to &quot;The Assault on Truth&quot;, Masson challenged his critics to address his arguments: &quot;My pessimistic conclusions may possibly be wrong. The documents may in fact allow a very different reading.&quot; Janet Malcolm interviewed Masson at length when writing her long &quot;New Yorker&quot; article on this controversy, which she later expanded into &quot;In the Freud Archives&quot;, a book that also dealt with Eissler and with Peter Swales.

In 1984 Masson sued &quot;The New Yorker,&quot; Janet Malcolm and the publisher Alfred A. Knopf for defamation, claiming that Malcolm had misquoted him. The ensuing trial drew considerable attention. The U.S. district court ruled against Masson. In 1989 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco upheld the lower court&#x27;s decision. “The Court of Appeals affirmed [...] that Malcolm had deliberately altered each quotation not found on the tape recordings, but nevertheless held that petitioner failed to raise a jury question of actual malice.” Masson petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court, which reversed the Court of Appeals decision and sent the case back to trial by jury. The decade-long ten-million-dollar federal lawsuit came to a close in 1994 when the jury and the court again ruled in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;‘s favor. Subsequent to the case, Janet Malcolm claimed to have found her handwritten notes indicating that Masson had lied in relation to the remaining disputed quotations, as he had lied in relation to quotations where there were recordings.

Meanwhile, in 1985, Masson edited and translated Freud&#x27;s complete correspondence with Wilhelm Fliess after having convinced Anna Freud to make it available in full. He also looked up the original places and documents in La Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris, where Freud had studied with Charcot. Masson writes that the scientific community has been largely silent about his views, and that he suffered personal attacks once he deviated from the traditional views on the seduction theory and the history of psychoanalysis. Both the traditional view and Masson&#x27;s case against it are built on the account that Freud&#x27;s seduction theory patients reported having been sexually abused in early childhood; several Freud scholars have disputed this account.

== Later work ==
Since the early 1990s, Masson has written a number of books on the emotional life of animals, one of which, &quot;When Elephants Weep&quot;, has been translated into 20 languages. He has explained this radical change in the subject of his writings as follows:

In 2008, Masson became a Director of Voiceless, the animal protection institute. &quot;We are not encouraged, on a daily basis, to pay careful attention to the animals we eat. On the contrary, the meat, dairy, and egg industries all actively encourage us to give thought to our own immediate interest (taste, for example, or cheap food) but not to the real suffering involved ... The animals involved suffer agony because of our ignorance. The least we owe them is to lessen that ignorance&quot;.

Masson also wrote a book about living in New Zealand, including an interview with Sir Edmund Hillary.

== Personal life ==
Masson is married to Leila Masson, a German pediatrician. They have two sons. He also has a daughter by a previous marriage with Therese Claire Masson. In the early 1990s, Masson had been engaged to University of Michigan feminist legal scholar Catharine MacKinnon, who wrote the preface to his &quot;A Dark Science: Women, Sexuality, and Psychiatry in the Nineteenth Century&quot;.

Masson became a vegan in 2004. He is an animal rights activist.

== Name ==
Masson&#x27;s great-grandfather Shlomo Moussaieff was a kabbalist and founder of the Bukharian Quarter in Jerusalem. His grandfather Henry Mousaieff changed his family name from Moussaieff to Masson. Masson changed his middle name from Lloyd to Moussaieff.

<text>The 1905 [[World Series]] was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1905 season. The National League (NL) champion New York Giants defeated the American League (AL) champion Philadelphia Athletics, with the Giants winning 4 games to 1, now in a best-4-of-7 format. Four of the five games featured duels between future Hall of Fame pitchers. The games were the second edition of the World Series after the initial meeting in 1903, since the 1904 season ended with no Series held.

Games 1 and 3 were played in Philadelphia; games 2, 4, 5 in New York.

Each of the five games was a shutout. Three of those, over a six-day span, were pitched and won by Christy Mathewson.

== Summary ==
Before the Series began, the Athletics were already at a major disadvantage. For the Series, they were without the services of Rube Waddell, who was arguably their best pitcher that year. The reason for Waddell&#x27;s absence was listed as a shoulder injury from some sort of &#x27;wrestling match&#x27; with teammate Andy Coakley, though in years since some have speculated that Waddell was actually bribed or &#x27;paid off&#x27; to fake the injury and thus not play in the Series. Philadelphia manager Connie Mack, however, refused to believe this theory, finding it ridiculous.

John McGraw, the Giants&#x27; manager, had previously referred to the Athletics as a &quot;white elephant&quot;, which the club defiantly adopted as a symbolic mascot. At the conference at home plate before Game 1, A&#x27;s team captain Lave Cross gave McGraw a wrapped package, which turned out to contain a toy white elephant. McGraw responded with a big grin, and the crowd laughed.[Philadelphia &quot;Inquirer&quot;, October 10, 2005, p. 10] McGraw and the Giants would have the last laugh, easily defeating the A&#x27;s in the Series.

== Matchups ==
=== Game 1 ===

The opening game was a pitchers&#x27; duel between Christy Mathewson and Eddie Plank. Both got out of jams, shutting the opposing offense down. In the Giants&#x27; top of the fifth, Mathewson singled, but was forced by Roger Bresnahan, who stole second shortly afterwards. After George Browne popped out, Mike Donlin singled to left, scoring Bresnahan and advancing Donlin to second. After Dan McGann walked, Sam Mertes doubled, bringing home Donlin. In the Athletics&#x27; half of the sixth, Ossee Schreckengost doubled and advanced to third on a wild pitch, but did not score, and was the lone runner to reach third base against Mathewson in the entire series. The Giants added an insurance run in the ninth, when Billy Gilbert scored on Bresnahan&#x27;s single. This was the first of Mathewson&#x27;s three complete-game shutouts, a World Series record that may never be matched.

=== Game 2 ===

The A&#x27;s called on Chief Bender to turn the tables on the Giants. His opponent was 21-game winner &quot;Iron Man&quot; Joe McGinnity. The game was scoreless until the top of the third. Ossee Schreckengost, leading off, reached on a Dan McGann&#x27;s error. Bender sacrificed, moving Schreckengost to second. After a groundout by Topsy Hartsel moved Schreckengost to third, Bris Lord singled to left and drove Ossee home with an unearned run. The slim margin held until the top of the eighth, when the A&#x27;s scored multiple times. With one out, Schreckengost was once again the catalyst, singling to center. After Bender flied out to right field, Hartsel&#x27;s double scored Schreckengost all the way from first (helped by an error from Bresnahan), and a single by Lord brought Hartsel home, making it 3–0 in favor of the A&#x27;s with all three runs unearned. Bender continued to cruise, got out of late-inning jams and ended up with a complete-game shutout that tied the series at one game each.

=== Game 3 ===

Christy Mathewson once again took the mound for the Giants in Game 3. Opposing him this time was Andy Coakley, who hit the first batter he faced, Roger Bresnahan, with a pitch. A single to right by Mike Donlin moved Bresnahan to third with one out. Dan McGann singled to right, bringing Bresnahan home. An error by Danny Murphy scored Donlin and put Sam Mertes on base. Bill Dahlen walked, loading the bases with one out, but Art Devlin hit into a double play to end the rally. The Giants put the game away in the top of the fifth. Bresnahan walked with one out. George Browne singled and went to second on the throw to third base. Donlin was walked intentionally, setting up a possible inning-ending double play, but things continued to crumble for Coakley and the A&#x27;s. McGann reached on another error by Danny Murphy, reloading the bases and scoring a run. Mertes singled, reloading the bases and driving in another run. Bill Dahlen hit into a force play at second, scoring Donlin. After Dahlen stole second, Devlin singled, bringing home McGann and sending Dahlen to third. Devlin then stole second and Dahlen stole home on a double steal, scoring the fifth and last run of the Giants&#x27; fifth. They scored two more runs in the top of the ninth, when McGann doubled home Browne and Donlin. Mathewson pitched his second complete-game shutout, giving the Giants a 2–1 lead in the series. This was the first 9–0 World Series game—the next one occurred when the Cubs shut out the Tigers by that lopsided score in Game 1 in , although Detroit ended up taking that series four games to three.

=== Game 4 ===

Eddie Plank returned for the A&#x27;s against Joe McGinnity for the Giants in Game 4. Both left men on base in scoring position early on, and kept the game scoreless until the bottom of the fourth, when Sam Mertes led off the inning by reaching on an error by Monte Cross. After Bill Dahlen flied to right Art Devlin grounded out, moving Mertes to second. With two outs, Billy Gilbert singled to left, bringing Mertes home for the only run of the game, McGinnity outdueling Plank 1–0 and giving the Giants a three-games-to-one lead.

=== Game 5 ===

The Giants looked to wrap up the series behind the perennial Christy Mathewson, who faced Chief Bender this time. The game was scoreless until the bottom of the fifth, when Sam Mertes scored during a bizarre double play involving Bill Dahlen and Billy Gilbert; with one out, Mertes on third, and Dahlen on second, Gilbert hit a sacrifice fly that scored Mertes, but Dahlen was out attempting to advance to third, and this third out was recorded after Mertes had scored. In the eighth, the Giants got an insurance run when Mathewson scored on George Browne&#x27;s ground out after Roger Bresnahan&#x27;s double had sent him to third with less than two out. Mathewson then took the mound for the top of the ninth and induced three ground outs, thereby completing arguably the single greatest performance by any player in World Series history with his third complete-game shutout of the series.

== Composite line score ==

<text>Louis the German (German: &quot;Ludwig der Deutsche&quot;; c. 806/810 – 28 August 876), also known as Louis II of Germany (German: &quot;Ludwig II. von Deutschland&quot;), was the first king of East Francia, and ruled from 843 to 876 AD. Grandson of emperor Charlemagne and the third son of Louis the Pious, emperor of Francia, and his first wife, Ermengarde of Hesbaye, he received the appellation &quot;Germanicus&quot; shortly after his death, when East Francia became known as the kingdom of Germany.

After protracted clashes with his father and his brothers, Louis received the East Frankish kingdom in the Treaty of Verdun (843). His attempts to conquer his half-brother Charles the Bald&#x27;s West Frankish kingdom in 858–59 were unsuccessful. The 860s were marked by a severe crisis, with the East Frankish rebellions of the sons, as well as struggles to maintain supremacy over his realm. In the Treaty of Meerssen he acquired Lotharingia for the East Frankish kingdom in 870. On the other hand, he tried and failed to claim both the title of Emperor and Italy. In the East, Louis was able to reach a longer-term peace agreement in 874 after decades of conflict with the Moravians. His rule shows a marked decline in creation of written administration and government documents, a trend that would continue into Ottonian times.

==Early life==
His early years were partly spent at the court of his grandfather, Charlemagne, whose special affection he is said to have won. When the emperor Louis the Pious divided his dominions between his sons in 817, Louis was made the ruler of the Duchy of Bavaria, following the practice of emperor Charlemagne of bestowing a local kingdom to a close family member who then would serve as his lieutenant and local governor. Louis ruled from Regensburg, the old capital of the Bavarii. In 825 he became involved in wars with the Wends and Sorbs on his eastern frontier. In 827, he married Hemma, sister of his stepmother Judith of Bavaria, both daughters of Welf, whose possessions ranged from Alsace to Bavaria.

It was not until 826 that Louis first came to rule Bavaria. In 828 and 829 he undertook two campaigns against the Bulgarians who wanted to penetrate into Pannonia without great success. During his time as Unterkönig, he tried to extend his rule to the Rhine-Main area.

==Rebellious son==
His involvement in the first civil war against his father&#x27;s reign was limited, but in the second his elder brothers, Lothair I, then King of Italy, and Pepin I, Duke of Aquitaine, persuaded him to invade Alamannia which their father had given to their young half-brother Charles the Bald, by promising to give him the land in the new partition they would make after a victory. In 832 he led an army of Slavs into Alamannia, but was driven back by his father. Louis the Pious disinherited him, but to no effect; the emperor was soon captured by his own rebellious sons and deposed. Upon his swift reinstatement, however, the emperor Louis made peace with his son Louis and legally restored Bavaria (never actually lost) to him in 836.

Louis was the instigator of the third civil war, which began in 839. A strip of his land having been given to the young half-brother Charles, Louis invaded Alamannia again. This time emperor Louis responded quickly, and soon the younger Louis was forced into the far southeastern corner of his realm, the March of Pannonia. Peace was then made by force of arms.

==Civil war and aftermath, 840–844==
When the emperor Louis died in 840, and Lothair I claimed the whole Empire, Louis allied with Charles the Bald. He defeated Lothair I&#x27;s commander, Adalbert of Metz, at the battle of the Ries on 13 May 841. A few weeks later, he and Charles defeated Lothair and their nephew Pepin II of Aquitaine at the battle of Fontenoy on 25 June. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. According to the Annals of Fulda, it was the biggest bloodbath the Franks had experienced since time immemorial. At the same time, it was Louis&#x27;s last battle in the struggle for the unification of the kingdom.

In June 842 the three brothers met on an island in the river Saône to negotiate a peace and each appointed forty representatives to arrange the boundaries of their respective kingdoms. This developed into the Treaty of Verdun, concluded by 10 August 843, by which Louis received the bulk of the lands lying east of the Rhine (East Francia), together with a district around Speyer, Worms, and Mainz, on the left bank of the river (see also Oaths of Strasbourg 842). His territories included Bavaria (where he made Regensburg the centre of his government), Thuringia, Franconia, and Saxony.

Louis may be called the founder of the German kingdom, though his attempts to maintain the unity of the Empire proved futile. Having in 842 crushed the &quot;Stellinga&quot; rising in Saxony, in 844 he compelled the Obotrites to accept his authority and put their prince, Gozzmovil, to death. Thachulf, Duke of Thuringia, then undertook campaigns against the Bohemians, Moravians, and other tribes, but was not very successful in resisting the ravaging Vikings.

==Conflicts with Charles the Bald==

In 852 Louis sent his son Louis the Younger to Aquitaine, where nobles had grown resentful of Charles the Bald&#x27;s rule. The younger Louis did not set out until 854, and returned the following year.

Starting from 853 Louis made repeated attempts to gain the throne of West Francia, which, according to the &quot;Annals of Fulda&quot; (&quot;Annales Fuldenses&quot;), the people of that country offered him in their disgust with the cruel misrule of Charles the Bald. Encouraged by his nephews Peppin II and Charles of Provence, Louis invaded in West Francia in 858. Charles the Bald could not even raise an army to resist the invasion and fled to Burgundy. Later that year Louis issued a charter dated &quot;the first year of the reign in West Francia.&quot; However, treachery and desertion in his army, and the continued loyalty of the Aquitanian bishops to Charles the Bald, brought about the failure of the whole enterprise. As such on 7 June 860 at Koblenz, both Louis and Charles made public vows to uphold the peace.

After the emperor Lothair I died in 855, Louis and Charles for a time cooperated in plans to divide Lothair&#x27;s possessions between themselves, the only impediments to this being Lothair&#x27;s sons and heirs—Lothair II (who received Lotharingia), Louis II of Italy (who held the imperial title and the Iron Crown of Lombardy) and Charles of Provence. In 868 at Metz Louis and Charles agreed to partition Lotharingia. When Lothair II died in 869, Louis was lying seriously ill, and his armies were engaged in a war with the Moravians. Charles the Bald quickly seized Lothair&#x27;s lands, but Louis, having recovered, compelled him by threat of war to agree to the Treaty of Meerssen, which divided Lothair&#x27;s lands among all the claimants.

==&quot;Divisio regni&quot; among the sons==
The later years of Louis the German were troubled by rebellions of his sons. The eldest, Carloman of Bavaria, revolted in 861 and again two years later. This was followed by the second son Louis the Younger, who was joined by his brother Charles the Fat. In 864 Louis was forced to grant Carloman the kingdom of Bavaria, which he himself had once held under his father. In 865 he divided the remainder of his lands—Saxony with Franconia and Thuringia went to Louis the Younger and Swabia with Raetia to Charles the Fat.

In May 868, Louis convoked a synod at Worms to deal with the aftermath of the Photian schism and to get the church&#x27;s support against Moravia.

A report that the Emperor Louis II had died in Italy led to a peace between father and sons and attempts by Louis the German to gain the imperial crown for his oldest son Carloman. These efforts were thwarted by Louis II, who was in fact not dead, and Louis&#x27; old adversary, Charles the Bald.

==Later life==

In the years 872 and 873, ambassadors of the Eastern Roman Emperor Basil I came to Louis in Regensburg and showed that his rule was perceived as far as Constantinople. After the death of Emperor Louis II in August 875, Louis tried to win the emperorship for himself and his descendants. For this purpose, Abbot Sigihard von Fulda undertook a trip to Rome to Pope John VIII. On 18 May 876 he returned to Ingelheim and reported to Louis that, in December 875, Charles the Bald had been able to obtain the title of emperor by a swift move to Rome.

His wife Hemma visited Louis for the last time in May 875. In 874 she had lost her voice as a result of a stroke. During his stay, he donated the Berg im Donaugau Abbey to the Marienkapelle, which he built. Hemma died at the end of January 876 in Regensburg. Louis then died from a stroke on 28 August 876 in his palace in Frankfurt. The following day he was buried by his son Louis in Lorsch Abbey. However, according to Wilfried Hartmann, it cannot be determined with certainty whether the dead man in his sarcophagus is the Carolingian king. After Louis&#x27; death, Charles the Bald tried to win over the Eastern kingdom as well. However, Louis the Younger defeated him on 8 October 876 at Andernach with a squad of Franks, Saxons and Thuringians. One year later, Charles the Bald died as well.

==Louis&#x27; Rule==
As there exist only 172 royal documents from 50 years of reign, it is impossible to create a detailed picture of Louis&#x27; whereabouts in the East Frankish kingdom. By comparison, Louis the Pious had 18 certificates created per year, and his half-brother Charles the Bald had 12 produced annually. This pattern of not producing many documents lasts for several months at certain times. For example, it is completely uncertain where the East Frankish king stayed between June 849 and July 850. At least 52 documents are addressed to Bavarian beneficiaries. However, the intensity of the documentary production for Bavarian recipients steadily decreased during his reign.

As former stem duchy, the Rhine-Main area contained Frankfurt, Mainz and Worms, and had plenty of Imperial Palaces and treasuries. Since it was located in the geographic centre of the East Frankish kingdom, it was easily accessible by road. As a result, it was the region in which most East Frankish synods and imperial assemblies were hosted.

==Nickname &quot;the German&quot;==
Louis was only nicknamed &quot;the German&quot; in the 18th century. Contemporary West Frankish sources called Louis &quot;rex Germaniae&quot; (&quot;King of Germania&quot;) or &quot;rex Germanorum&quot; (&quot;King of the Teutons&quot;). However, in this context, Germania or Germani does not mean &quot;Germany&quot; or &quot;the Germans&quot;, but, as in ancient Latin, the area on the right bank of the Rhine outside the former Roman Empire and its inhabitants. Contemporaries gave Louis the epithet &quot;pius&quot; (pious) or &quot;piissimus&quot; (very pious). The contemporary coinage called him &quot;HLUDOVICUS PIUS REX&quot;.

==Marriage and children==
Louis was married to Hemma (died 31 January 876), and they had:
*Hildegard (828–856), abbess of Fraumunster
*Carloman of Bavaria (829–880), King of Bavaria
*Irmgard of Chiemsee also known as Ermengard (died 866) (Louis, having established two of his other daughters as abbesses of convents, appointed Irmgard (also known as Ermengard) to govern first the monastery of Buchau and then the royal abbey of Chiemsee in Bavaria. She is commemorated as a saint on 17 July.)
*Gisela, possibly died in childhood
*Louis the Younger (835–882)
*Bertha (died 877)
*Charles the Fat (839–888)

<text>Ivor Novello (born David Ivor Davies; 15 January 1893 – 6 March 1951) was a Welsh actor, dramatist, singer and composer who became one of the most popular British entertainers of the first half of the 20th century.

He was born into a musical family, and his first successes were as a songwriter. His first big hit was &quot;Keep the Home Fires Burning&quot; (1914), which was enormously popular during the First World War. His 1917 show, &quot;Theodore &amp; Co&quot;, was a wartime hit. After the war, Novello contributed numbers to several successful musical comedies and was eventually commissioned to write the scores of complete shows. He wrote his musicals in the style of operetta and often composed his music to the libretti of Christopher Hassall.

In the 1920s he turned to acting, first in British films and then on stage, with considerable success in both. He starred in two silent films directed by Alfred Hitchcock, &quot;The Lodger&quot; and &quot;Downhill&quot; (both 1927). On stage, he played the title character in the first London production of &quot;Liliom&quot; (1926). Novello briefly went to Hollywood but soon returned to Britain, where he had more successes, especially on stage, appearing in his own lavish West End productions of musicals. The best-known of these were &quot;Glamorous Night&quot; (1935) and &quot;The Dancing Years&quot; (1939).

From the 1930s he often performed with Zena Dare, writing parts for her in his works. He continued to write for film, but in his later career his biggest successes were with stage musicals: &quot;Perchance to Dream&quot; (1945), &quot;King&#x27;s Rhapsody&quot; (1949) and &quot;Gay&#x27;s the Word&quot; (1951).

The Ivor Novello Awards were named after him in 1955.

==Early years==

Novello was born David Ivor Davies in Cardiff, Wales, to David Davies (c. 1852–1931), a rent collector for the city council, and his wife, Clara Novello Davies, an internationally known singing teacher and choral conductor. As a boy, Novello was a successful singer in the Welsh Eisteddfod. His mother set up as a voice teacher in London, where he met leading performers, including members of George Edwardes&#x27;s Gaiety Theatre company, classical musicians such as Landon Ronald, and singers such as Adelina Patti. Another of his mother&#x27;s associates was Clara Butt, who taught him to sing &quot;Abide with Me&quot; when he was a boy of six.

Novello was educated privately in Cardiff and then in Gloucester, where he studied harmony and counterpoint with Herbert Brewer, the cathedral organist. From there he won a scholarship to Magdalen College School in Oxford, where he was a solo treble in the college choir. He later said that this prolonged youthful exposure to early sacred choral music had turned his tastes, in reaction, to lush romantic music. Although Brewer had told him he would not have a career in music, Novello from his early youth showed a facility for writing songs, and when he was only 15, one of his songs was published. After leaving school, he gave piano lessons in Cardiff, and then moved to London in 1913 with his mother. They took a flat above the Strand Theatre, which became his London home for the rest of his life.

In London he found a mentor in Sir Edward Marsh, a well-known patron of the arts and Winston Churchill&#x27;s secretary. Marsh encouraged him to compose and introduced him to people who could help his career. He adopted his mother&#x27;s middle name, &quot;Novello&quot;, as his professional surname, although he did not change it legally until 1927.

In 1914, at the start of the First World War, Novello wrote &quot;Keep the Home Fires Burning&quot;, a song that expressed the feelings of innumerable families sundered by the war. Novello composed the music for the song to a lyric by the American Lena Guilbert Ford, and it became a huge popular success, bringing Novello money and fame at the age of 21. In other respects, the war had less impact on Novello than on many young men of his age. He avoided enlistment until June 1916, when he reported to a Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) training depot as a probationary flight sub-lieutenant. After Novello twice crashed aeroplanes, Marsh arranged his move to the Admiralty office in central London for the rest of the war.

==Composer and actor==

Novello continued to write songs while serving in the RNAS. He had his first stage success with &quot;Theodore &amp; Co&quot; in 1916, a production by George Grossmith Jr. and Edward Laurillard with a score composed by Novello and the young Jerome Kern. In the same year, Novello contributed to André Charlot&#x27;s revue &quot;See-Saw&quot;. In 1917 he wrote for another Grossmith and Laurillard production, the operetta &quot;Arlette&quot;, for which he contributed additional numbers to an existing French score by Jane Vieu and Guy le Feuvre. In the same year, Marsh introduced him to the actor Bobbie Andrews, who became Novello&#x27;s life partner. Andrews introduced Novello to the young Noël Coward. Coward, six years Novello&#x27;s junior, was deeply envious of Novello&#x27;s effortless glamour. He wrote, &quot;I just felt suddenly conscious of the long way I had to go before I could break into the magic atmosphere in which he moved and breathed with such nonchalance&quot;.

In 1918 and after the war, Novello continued to write successfully for musical comedy and revue. The former included &quot;Who&#x27;s Hooper?&quot; (1919), an adaptation of a Pinero play, with a book by Fred Thompson, lyrics by Clifford Grey, and music by Howard Talbot and Novello, and &quot;The Golden Moth&quot; by Thompson and P. G. Wodehouse (1921), for which Novello provided the entire score. For Charlot, he contributed numbers to the revues &quot;Tabs&quot; (1918), &quot;A to Z&quot; (1921) and &quot;Puppets&quot; (1924). For the second of these, his songs included one of his few well-known comedy numbers, &quot;And Her Mother Came Too&quot;, with lyrics by Dion Titheradge, written for Jack Buchanan.

At the same time as his successes as a composer, Novello was making a career as an actor. With &quot;a classic profile that gained him matinee idol status amongst the film-going public&quot;, he was sought out, on the strength of a publicity photograph, by the Swiss film director Louis Mercanton. Mercanton offered him a silent-film role as the romantic lead in &quot;The Call of the Blood&quot; (1920). In the same year, he made another film for Mercanton, &quot;Miarka&quot;. Novello made his first British film, &quot;Carnival&quot;, the following year.
Novello made his stage debut in 1921 in &quot;Deburau&quot; by Sacha Guitry, and, among other stage engagements in the next years, he played Bingley in a charity adaptation of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. At about this time, Novello had an affair with the writer Siegfried Sassoon; it was short-lived, but in the words of Sassoon&#x27;s biographer John Stuart Roberts, Novello &quot;was a consummate flirt who collected lovers as he gathered lilacs&quot;.

In 1923, Novello made his American movie debut in D. W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;The White Rose&quot;, and the same year he starred in &quot;The Man Without Desire&quot;, among other British films. He next co-wrote, produced and starred in the successful 1924 play &quot;The Rat&quot;. The play was made into a film in 1925, which was so successful that two sequels followed in 1926 and 1928. His dramatic roles in the West End included the title character in the first London production of Ferenc Molnár&#x27;s &quot;Liliom&quot; (1926).

Other films in which Novello starred included Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Lodger&quot;, where he played the title character, and &quot;Downhill&quot; (both in 1927). The British film company Gainsborough Pictures offered Novello a lucrative contract, which enabled him to buy a country house in Littlewick Green, near Maidenhead. He renamed the property &#x27;Redroofs&#x27;, and he entertained there famously and with little regard for convention. Cecil Beaton, noting the frequent homosexual excesses, coined the phrase, &quot;the Ivor – Noel naughty set&quot;. Coward had by now caught up to Novello professionally, despite a joint disaster when Novello starred in Coward&#x27;s play &quot;Sirocco&quot; in 1927, which was a débâcle, and closed within a month of opening. In 1928 Novello starred in the silent adaptation of Coward&#x27;s much more successful &quot;The Vortex&quot;, and made his last silent film, &quot;A South Sea Bubble&quot;. During the late 1920s Novello was the most popular male British film star, and was often dubbed Britain&#x27;s &quot;handsomest screen actor&quot;.

Novello returned to composing for the lyric stage in 1929, writing eight numbers for the revue &quot;The House that Jack Built&quot;. In the same year, he presented his own play &quot;Symphony in Two Flats&quot;, which he took to New York the following year. It was followed by a successful Broadway production of his &quot;The Truth Game&quot;, which brought him to the attention of Hollywood studios. He accepted a contract to write for and appear in MGM films. He found little to do in Hollywood, however, beyond writing the dialogue for &quot;Tarzan the Ape Man&quot;. Returning to London, he starred in the sound remake of &quot;The Lodger&quot; (1932).

==1930s musicals==

After beginning the 1930s with a series of non-musical plays – &quot;I Lived with You&quot; (1932), &quot;Fresh Fields&quot;, &quot;Proscenium&quot;, &quot;Sunshine Sisters&quot;, &quot;Flies in the Sun&quot; (all 1933) and &quot;Murder in Mayfair&quot; (1934) – Novello returned to composition in 1935 with &quot;Glamorous Night&quot;, which was the first of a series of enormously popular musicals. &quot;The Times&quot; considered that it was for these that Novello would be popularly remembered. Paul Webb, in the &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, writes that Novello&#x27;s show saved the fortunes of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane:

Another model was Coward&#x27;s 1929 musical &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot;, which Novello called &quot;a &quot;lovely&quot;, lovely thing ... sheer joy from beginning to end&quot;. That, too, was an old-fashioned musical, &quot;so full of regret ... for a vanished kindly silly darling age&quot;.

For all his four 1930s musicals, Novello wrote the book and music, Christopher Hassall wrote the lyrics, and the orchestrations were by Charles Prentice. &quot;Glamorous Night&quot; starred Novello and Mary Ellis, with a cast including Zena Dare, Olive Gilbert and Elizabeth Welch, and ran from 2 May 1935 to 18 July 1936, at Drury Lane and then the London Coliseum. &quot;Careless Rapture&quot; ran from 11 September 1936 for 296 performances, with Novello, Dorothy Dickson and Zena Dare in the leading roles. &quot;Crest of the Wave&quot; starred Novello, Dickson and Gilbert, and ran from 1 September 1937 for 203 performances. The last of Novello&#x27;s prewar musicals was &quot;The Dancing Years&quot;, which starred Novello, Ellis and Gilbert, opened at Drury Lane, closed on the outbreak of the Second World War, toured and then reopened at the Adelphi Theatre, running in the West End for a combined total of 696 performances and closing on 8 July 1944. This show was the closest Novello came to fulfilling his mother&#x27;s early ambitions for him to write operas; he played an Austrian composer-conductor at the Wiener Hofoper.

==Second World War and last years==
Novello presented only two new shows during the Second World War. &quot;Arc de Triomphe&quot; (1943), a musical vehicle for Mary Ellis, was only a modest success, but &quot;Perchance to Dream&quot; (1945) was immensely successful, running for 1,022 performances. In between the two shows, Novello had been in serious legal trouble and served four weeks in prison for misuse of petrol coupons, a serious offence under rationing laws in wartime Britain. An admiring fan had stolen the coupons from her employer, but the court found that Novello was also culpable. The prison term, though short, came as a severe shock to Novello, both mentally and physically, and had serious lasting effects. Not everybody was supportive; Coward&#x27;s sympathy was limited: &quot;He&#x27;s been fighting like a steer to keep going as before the war and hasn&#x27;t done a thing for the general effort&quot;, but when Novello returned to &quot;The Dancing Years&quot; after his release, he received &quot;a rapturous ovation&quot; on his first entrance.

Novello&#x27;s last full-scale production in this style, &quot;King&#x27;s Rhapsody&quot; (1949), was, in Webb&#x27;s words, &quot;a self-consciously romantic counter-blast to the modern musical: crown princes, ballrooms, royal yachts, beautiful princesses and a full-scale coronation&quot;. After the rigours of war, this escapist entertainment had strong box-office appeal and ran for 841 performances. The show starred Novello and the cast included Phyllis Dare, Zena Dare, Olive Gilbert and Bobbie Andrews. It was still running, at the Palace Theatre, when Novello&#x27;s last show opened. This was &quot;Gay&#x27;s the Word&quot; (1951). Novello had written no role for himself; the show starred the comedy actress Cicely Courtneidge and was a departure from his established pattern, balancing the contrasting styles of European operetta and post-war American musicals. &quot;The Times&quot; commented that the show &quot;cheerfully parodied the very Ruritanian romances to which he owed his most triumphant successes&quot;.

==Death and legacy==

Novello died suddenly from a coronary thrombosis at the age of 58, a few hours after completing a performance of &quot;King&#x27;s Rhapsody&quot;. He was cremated at the Golders Green Crematorium, and his ashes are buried beneath a lilac bush and marked with a plaque that reads &quot;Ivor Novello 6th March 1951 &#x27;Till you are home once more&#x27;.&quot; He left an estate worth £160,000 (£million in ).

Only a few weeks before Novello&#x27;s death, Coward had written of him: &quot;Theatre – good, bad and indifferent – is the love of his life. For him, other human endeavours are mere shadows. ... The reward of his work lies in the indisputable fact that whenever and wherever he appears the vast majority of the British public flock to see him.&quot; &quot;The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; writes of Novello that he was &quot;until the advent of Andrew Lloyd Webber, the 20th century&#x27;s most consistently successful composer of British musicals&quot;.

The Ivor Novello Awards for songwriting, established in 1955 in Novello&#x27;s memory, are awarded each year by The Ivors Academy (formerly the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA)) to British songwriters and composers as well as to an outstanding international music writer. A scholarship in memory of Novello was established at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and in 1952 a bronze bust of him by Clemence Dane was unveiled at Drury Lane. In St. Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden, known as the &quot;actors&#x27; church&quot;, a panel was installed to commemorate Novello, and in 1972, to mark the 21st anniversary of his death, a memorial stone was unveiled in St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

In 1993, the centenary of Novello&#x27;s birth was marked by several celebratory shows around the UK, including one at the Players Theatre in London. In 2005, the Strand Theatre, above which Novello lived for many years, was renamed the Novello Theatre, with a plaque in his honour set at the entrance. On 27 June 2009, a statue of Novello was unveiled outside the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff Bay. Plaques detailing some of his best-known songs are fitted to the pedestal, along with a dedication to Novello. Novello&#x27;s memory is promoted by The Ivor Novello Appreciation Bureau, which holds annual events around Britain, including an annual pilgrimage to Redroofs each June. Redroofs was sold after Novello&#x27;s death, and is now a theatre training school.

Novello was portrayed in Robert Altman&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;Gosford Park&quot; by Jeremy Northam, and several of his songs were used for the film&#x27;s soundtrack, including &quot;Waltz of My Heart&quot;, &quot;And Her Mother Came Too&quot;, &quot;I Can Give You the Starlight&quot;, &quot;What a Duke Should Be&quot;, &quot;Why Isn&#x27;t It You?&quot; and &quot;The Land of Might-Have-Been&quot;. Jeremy Irvine played Novello in the 2021 Terence Davies film &quot;Benediction&quot;, about the life of his one-time lover, the war poet Siegfried Sassoon.

==Songs==

Among Novello&#x27;s well-known songs are &quot;Keep the Home Fires Burning&quot;, &quot;Fold Your Wings&quot;, &quot;Shine Through My Dreams&quot;, &quot;Rose of England&quot;, &quot;I Can Give You the Starlight&quot;, &quot;And Her Mother Came Too&quot;, &quot;My Dearest Dear&quot;, &quot;The Land of Might-Have-Been&quot;, &quot;When I Curtsied to the King&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;ll Gather Lilacs&quot;, &quot;Someday My Heart Will Awake&quot;, &quot;Yesterday&quot;, &quot;Waltz of My Heart&quot;, &quot;Why Isn&#x27;t It You&quot;, &quot;My Life Belongs to You&quot;, &quot;Fly Home Little Heart&quot;, &quot;Take Your Girl&quot; and &quot;Primrose&quot;.

In &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, Webb writes that although Novello&#x27;s oeuvre is generally thought of as &quot;romantic&quot; and &quot;Ruritanian&quot;, his music &quot;was far more varied than his current reputation suggests&quot;. Webb contends that such romantic hits as &quot;Someday My Heart Will Awake&quot; were balanced by &quot;rousing operetta choruses ... and jazz age numbers&quot; while Rose of England&#x27; is a stately patriotic piece that stands comparison with Elgar or Walton&quot;.

<text>In political philosophy, the means of production refers to the generally necessary assets and resources that enable a society to engage in production. While the exact resources encompassed in the term may vary, it is widely agreed to include the classical factors of production (land, labour, and capital) as well as the general infrastructure and capital goods necessary to reproduce stable levels of productivity. It can also be used as an abbreviation of the &quot;means of production and distribution&quot; which additionally includes the logistical distribution and delivery of products, generally through distributors; or as an abbreviation of the &quot;means of production, distribution, and exchange&quot; which further includes the exchange of distributed products, generally to consumers.

The concept of &quot;Means of Production&quot; is used by researchers in various fields of study — including politics, economics, and sociology — to discuss, broadly, the relationship between anything that can have productive use, its ownership, and the constituent social parts needed to produce it.

== Industrial production ==
From the perspective of a firm, a firm uses its capital goods, which are also known as tangible assets as they are physical in nature. Unfinished goods are transformed into products and services in the production process. Even if capital goods are not traded on the market as consumer goods, they can be valued as long as capital goods are produced commodities, which are required for production. The total values of capital goods constitute the capital value.

The social means of production are capital goods and assets that require organized collective labor effort, as opposed to individual effort, to operate on. The ownership and organization of the social means of production is a key factor in categorizing and defining different types of economic systems.

The means of production includes two broad categories of objects: instruments of labor (tools, factories, infrastructure, etc.) and subjects of labor (natural resources and raw materials). People operate on the subjects of labor using the instruments of labor to create a product; or stated another way, labor acting on the means of production creates a good. In an agrarian society the principal means of production is the soil and the shovel. In an industrial society the means of production become social means of production and include factories and mines.

== Knowledge production ==
In a knowledge economy, learning, research, development, innovation, ideas and creativity are the means of [knowledge] production; communication such as books, articles, videos disseminated both physically and digitally over the Internet are a means of [knowledge] distribution. In a broad sense, the &quot;means of production&quot; also includes the &quot;means of distribution&quot; such as stores, the internet and railroads (Infrastructural capital).

== Depreciation ==
The means of production of the firm may depreciate, which means there is a loss in the economic value of capital goods or tangible assets (e.g. machinery, factory equipment) due to wear and tear, and aging. This is known as the depreciation of capital goods.

== Marxism and Marxist theory of class ==

The analysis of the technological sophistication of the means of production and how they are owned is a central component in the Marxist theoretical framework of historical materialism and in Marx&#x27;s critique of political economy, and later in Marxian economics.

In Marx&#x27;s work and subsequent developments in Marxist theory, the process of socioeconomic evolution is based on the premise of technological improvements in the means of production. As the level of technology improves with respect to productive capabilities, existing forms of social relations become superfluous and unnecessary as the advancement of technology integrated within the means of production contradicts the established organization of society and its economy.

The increasing efficiency of the means of production via the creation and adaptation of new technologies over time has a tendency to rearrange local and global market structures, leading to the disruption of existing profit pools, creating the possibility of massive economic impact. Disruptive technologies can lead to the devaluation of various forms of labor power, up to the point of making human labor power economically noncompetitive in certain applications, potentially widening income inequality.

According to Marx, escalating tension between the upper and lower class is a major consequence of technology decreasing the value of labor force and the contradictory effect an evolving means of production has on established social and economic systems. Marx believed increasing inequality between the upper and lower classes acts as a major catalyst of class conflicts, which develop to a point where the existing mode of production inevitably becomes unsustainable, either collapsing or being overthrown in a social revolution, at which point the contradictory relationship between technological advancement and the value of labor force is resolved by the emergence of a new mode of production based on a different set of social relations including, most notably, different patterns of ownership for the means of production.

Ownership of the means of production and control over the surplus product generated by their operation is the fundamental factor in delineating different modes of production. Capitalism is defined as private ownership and control over the means of production, where the surplus product becomes a source of unearned income for its owners. Under this system, profit-seeking individuals or organizations undertake a majority of economic activities. However, capitalism does not indicate all material means of production are privately owned as partial economies are publicly owned.

By contrast, socialism is defined as social ownership of the means of production so that the surplus product accrues to society at large.

=== Determinant of class ===
Marx&#x27;s theory of class defines classes in their relation to their ownership and control of the means of production. In a capitalist society, the bourgeoisie, or the capitalist class, is the class that owns the means of production and derives a passive income from their operation. Examples of the capitalist class include business owners, shareholders and the minority of people who own factories, machinery and lands. Countries considered as the capitalist countries include Australia, Canada, the U.S., and other nations which hold a free market economy. In modern society, small business owners, minority shareholders and other smaller capitalists are considered as &quot;Petite bourgeoisie&quot; according to Marx&#x27;s theory, which is distinct from bourgeoisie and proletariat as they can buy the labour of others but also work along with employees.

In contrast, the proletariat, or working class, comprises the majority of the population that lacks access to the means of production and are therefore induced to sell their labour power for a wage or salary to gain access to necessities, goods and services.

According to Marx, wages and salaries are considered as the price of labour power, related to working hours or outputs produced by the labour force. At the company level, an employee does not control and own the means of production in a capitalist mode of production. Instead, an employee is performing specific duties under a contract of employment, working for wages or salaries. As for firms and profit-seeking organizations, from a personnel economics perspective, to maximize efficiency and productivity there must be an equilibrium between labour markets and product markets. In human resource practices, compensation structure tends to shift towards pay-for-performance bonus or incentive pay rather than base salary to attract the right workers, even if conflicts of interest exist in an employer-worker relationship.

To the question of why classes exist in human societies in the first place, Karl Marx offered a historical and scientific explanation that it was the cultural practice of ownership of the means of production that gives rise to them. This explanation differs dramatically from other explanations based on &quot;differences in ability&quot; between individuals or on religious or political affiliations giving rise to castes. This explanation is consistent with the bulk of Marxist theory in which Politics and Religion are seen as mere outgrowths (superstructures) of the basic underlying economic reality of a people.

== Related terms ==
Factors of production are defined by German philosopher Karl Marx in his book &quot;Das Kapital&quot; as labor, subjects of labor, and instruments of labor: the term is equivalent to means of production plus labor. The factors of production are often listed in economic writings derived from the classical school as &quot;land, labour and capital&quot;. Marx sometimes used the term &quot;productive forces&quot; equivalently with &quot;factors of production&quot;; in &quot;Kapital&quot;, he uses &quot;factors of production&quot;, in his famous Preface to his &quot;Critique of Political Economy: A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy&quot;, he uses &quot;productive forces&quot; (that may depend on the translation).

Production relations (German: &quot;Produktionsverhältnis&quot;) are the relations humans enter into with each other in using the means of production to produce. Examples of such relations are employer/employee, buyer/seller, the technical division of labour in a factory, and property relations.

Mode of production (German: &quot;Produktionsweise&quot;) means the dominant way in which production is organised in society. For instance, &quot;capitalism&quot; is the name for the capitalist &quot;mode of production&quot; in which the means of production are owned privately by a small class (the bourgeoisie) who profits off the labor of the working class (the proletariat). Communism is a mode of production in which the means of production are not owned by anyone, but shared in common, without class-based exploitation. Besides capitalism and communism, there is another mode of production which is called a Mixed Economic System. In a mixed economy, private ownership of capital goods are protected and a certain level of the market economy is allowed. However, the government has the right to intervene in the market and economic activities for social objectives. Different from the pure capitalism, the government regulation exists to control particular means of production over the private business sector. Different from communism, the majority of means of production are privately owned rather than shared in common.

<doc id="47157" wikidata="Q60625" url="?curid=47157" title="Conrad Celtes">
<text>Conrad Celtes (; ; 1 February 1459 – 4 February 1508) was a German Renaissance humanist scholar and poet of the German Renaissance born in Franconia (nowadays part of Bavaria). He led the theatrical performances at the Viennese court and reformed the syllabi.

Celtis is considered by many to be the greatest of German humanists and thus dubbed &quot;the Archhumanist&quot; (&quot;Erzhumanist&quot;). He is also praised as &quot;the greatest lyric genius and certainly the greatest organizer and popularizer of German Humanism&quot;.

==Life==
Born at Wipfeld, near Schweinfurt (present-day Lower Franconia) under his original name Konrad Bickel or Pyckell (modern spelling Pickel), Celtes left home to avoid being set to his father&#x27;s trade of vintner, and pursued his studies at the University of Cologne (1477–1479; B.A., 1479) and at the University of Heidelberg (M.A., 1485). While at Heidelberg, he received patronage and instruction from Dalberg and Agricola. As customary in those days for humanists, he Latinized his name, to Conradus Celtis. For some time he delivered humanist lectures during his travels to Erfurt, Rostock and Leipzig. His first work was titled &quot;Ars versificandi et carminum&quot; (The Art of Writing Verses and Poems, 1486). He further undertook lecture tours to Rome, Florence, Bologna and Venice.

The elector Frederick of Saxony approached the emperor Frederick III, who named Conrad Celtes &quot;Poet Laureate&quot; (Honored Poet) upon his return. At this great imperial ceremonial gathering in Nuremberg, Celtes was at the same time presented with a doctoral degree. Celtes again made a lecturing tour throughout the empire.

In 1489–1491, he stayed in Kraków where he studied mathematics, astronomy and the natural sciences at the Jagiellonian University (at which he enrolled in 1489), and befriended many other humanists such as Lorenz Rabe and Bonacursius. He also founded a learned society, based on the Roman academies. The local branch of the society was called &quot;Sodalitas Litterarum Vistulana&quot; (the &quot;Literary Society on the Vistula River&quot;).

In 1490 he once again went through Breslau (Wrocław) to Prague, capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia. Hartmann Schedel used Celtis&#x27; descriptions of Breslau in the &quot;Schedelsche Weltchronik&quot; (Nuremberg Chronicle). In Hungary, Celtis formed the &quot;Sodalitas Litterarum Hungaria&quot; (&quot;Hungarian Literary Society&quot;), later as &quot;Sodalitas Litterarum Danubiana&quot; to be based in Vienna. He made stops at Regensburg, Passau and Nuremberg (and probably Mainz). At Heidelberg he founded the &quot;Sodalitas Litterarum Rhenana&quot; (&quot;Rhineland Literary Society&quot;). Later he went to Lübeck and Ingolstadt. At Ingolstadt, in 1492, he delivered his famous speech to the students there, in which he called on Germans to rival Italians in learning and letters. This would later become an extremely popular address in sixteenth-century German nationalistic sentiment.

In 1494, Celtes rediscovered Hrosvitha&#x27;s works written in Latin in the monastery of St. Emmeram in Regensburg. His friend Willibald Pickheimer introduce him to Abbess Caritas Pickheimer. He wrote her in Latin and called her the &quot;new Hrotsvitha&quot;.

While the plague ravaged Ingolstadt, Celtes taught at Heidelberg. By now he was a professor. In 1497 Celtes was called to Vienna by the emperor Maximilian I, who honored him as &quot;teacher of the art of poetry and conversation&quot; with an imperial &quot;Privilegium&quot;, the first of its kind. There he lectured on the works of classical writers and in 1502 founded the &quot;Collegium Poetarum&quot;, a college for poets. His invitation to Vienna came about greatly at the influence of his friend and fellow scholar Johannes Cuspinian.

Celtes died in Vienna a few years later of syphilis.

According to Richard Unger, Celtes was a large scale book thief who walked around episcopal palaces and monastic libraries stealing books for his emperor and himself. He justified his behaviours on the basis of patriotic intentions, claiming that he only wanted to protect German patrimony from &quot;damaging weather, dust, mold... insects&quot;, as well as Italians. Emily Abu writes that Celtis, Peutinger and their emperor took particular interest in cultural legacies that could provide connection between their German Roman Empire and the ancient Roman imperium. In the case of the Peutinger map (mentioned below), both Celtis and Peutinger made sure that any record of where Celtis found it as well as clues to the map&#x27;s first three centuries were erased.

==Works==
Conrad Celtes&#x27; teachings had lasting effects, particularly in the fields of classical languages and history. He brought systematic methods to the teaching of Latin and furthered the study of the classics. He was also the first to teach the history of the world as a whole. Celtes was the first early modern humanist who introduced the term &quot;topography&quot; as a critical appraisal of the Ptolemaic dichotomy between cosmography and chorography, which was becoming insufficient to reflect the rapidly changing contours of Europe.

He was the foremost cartographic writer in German lands. He worked on the large-scale cosmographic and cartographic project &quot;Germania Illustrata&quot;, of which the core — among them the treatise &quot;Germania generalis&quot;, four books of love elegies, and &quot;De origine, situ, moribus et institutis Norimbergae libellus&quot; (&quot;On the origins, site, habits and institutions of Nuremberg&quot;) — was published under the title &quot;Quatuor libri amorum secundum quatuor latera germanie&quot; in Nuremberg (1502).

In 1493, he discovered the writings of Hroswitha of Gandersheim in the monastery of St. Emmaram. He then stole the manuscript and had it mass-printed across the Empire in 1501. Also in 1501, he received a privilege from the Imperial Aulic Council for the printing of his edition of her dramas. This was one of the earliest recorded privileges regarding copyrights granted by the Imperial government. Celtes also discovered a map showing roads of the Roman Empire, the &quot;Tabula Peutingeriana&quot;, or Peutinger Table. Celtes collected numerous Greek and Latin manuscripts in his function as librarian of the imperial library that was founded by Maximilian, and he claimed to have discovered the missing books of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Fasti&quot; in a letter to the Venetian publisher Aldus Manutius in 1504. The purported new verses had actually been composed by an 11th-century monk and were known to the Empire of Nicaea according to William of Rubruck, but even so, many contemporary scholars believed Celtes and continued to write about the existence of the missing books until well into the 17th century. His epigrams, edited by Kark Hartfelder, were published in Berlin in 1881.

Conrad Celtes was more of a free-thinking humanist and placed a higher value on the ancient pagan, rather than the Christian ideal. His friend Willibald Pirckheimer had blunt discussions with him on that subject. As early as &quot;Ode ad Apollinem&quot; (1486), he began to style himself as an Apollo-Priest. The most important earthly Phoebus to him was Maximilian, whose symbiotic relationship with the scholar (and thus their double glory) was often reflected in Celtis&#x27;s literary works.
The Celtis-Gymnasium in Schweinfurt was named after Conrad Celtis.

<doc id="47163" wikidata="Q451827" url="?curid=47163" title="Emperor Shōkō">
<text>was the 101st emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. His reign spanned the years from 1412 through 1428.

==Genealogy==
His personal name was Mihito (initially written as 躬仁, and later written as 実仁).
He was the eldest son of Emperor Go-Komatsu. His mother was Hinonishi Motoko (日野西資子), daughter of Hino Sukekuni (日野資国). He had no children of his own, and was succeeded by his third cousin, Emperor Go-Hanazono, great-grandson of the Northern Pretender Emperor Sukō.

The name &quot;&quot;Shōkō&quot; (称光) was formed by taking one &quot;kanji&quot; from the names of the 48th and 49th imperial rulers Empress Shōtoku (称徳) and Emperor Kōnin (光仁).

::::::Empress Shōtoku (称徳)

===Issue===
*Lady-in-waiting: Fujiwara (Hino) Mitsuko (藤原（日野）光子), Hino Katsumitsu’s daughter
*Naishi: Minamoto (Itsutsuji) Tomoko (源（五辻）朝子), Itsutsuji Tomonaka’s daughter
**daughter: (b.1418)
*Naishi: Takakura Nagafuji’s daughter
*Court Lady: Iyo no Tsubone (伊予局), Jimyoin Motochika’s daughter
**daughter: (b.1426)
*Court Lady: Kii no Tsubone (紀伊局), Kamo Tomo’s daughter

==Events of Shōkō&#x27;s life==
He reigned from October 5, 1412 until his death on August 30, 1428.

Shōkō became emperor upon the abdication of his father, Go-Komatsu in &quot;Ōei&quot; 18, in the 10th month (October 5, 1412). His actual coronation date was two years later.

The &quot;retired&quot; Go-Komatsu ruled as a Cloistered Emperor during Shōkō&#x27;s reign.

Shōkō was connected to Ashikaga Yoshimitsu and the Hino clan through his mother&#x27;s side.

Shōkō&quot;-tennō&quot; was only 12 years old when he assumed the role of formal head of the &quot;Daïri&quot;; but &quot;Go-Komatsu&quot;-in&quot;&quot; had direction of the court [and] the Shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimochi was charged with the general superintendence of affairs.&quot;

* October 5, 1412 (&quot;Ōei 18, on the 18th day of the 9th month&quot;): Emperor Shōkō was made the new sovereign upon the abdication of his father, Emperor Go-Komatsu; and the succession (‘‘senso’’) was received.

Shōkō was only 12 years old when he began living in the daïri; but Go-Komatsu, as a Cloistered Emperor still retained direction of the court and the Shōgun was charged with the general superintendence of affairs.
* 1413 (&quot;Ōei 20&quot;): Shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimochi fell ill, and so he sent an ambassador to the Ise Shrine to pray for the return of his health.
* January 29, 1415 (&quot;Ōei 21, on the 19th day of the 12th month&quot;): Enthronement of Emperor Shōkō was two years after the &quot;senso&quot; was received. At this point, Emperor Shōkō is said to have acceded to the throne (‘‘sokui’’).
* 1418 (&quot;Ōei 25&quot;): Ashikaga Yoshimochi ordered Asama Shrine, at the base of Mount Fuji in Suruga province, to be re-built.
* July 18, 1419 (&quot;Ōei 26, on the 26th day of the 6th month&quot;): Oei Invasion. Korea invaded Tsushima Province.
* 1423 (&quot;Ōei 30, 2nd month&quot;): Shōgun Yoshimochi retired in favor of his son, Ashikaga Yoshikatsu, who was 17 years old.
* March 17, 1425 (&quot;Ōei 32, on the 27th day of the 2nd month&quot;): Shōgun Yoshikatsu died at the age of 19 years, having administered the empire for only three years.
* February 3, 1428 (&quot;Shōchō 1, 18th day of the 1st month&quot;): Shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimochi, having taken power again after the death of his son, died himself at the age of 43.
* August 30, 1428 (&quot;Shōchō 1, 20th day of the 7th month&quot;): Emperor Shōkō died at the age of 27.&quot;Nihon Ōdai Ichiran&quot; suggests a cause of death by explaining: &quot;Ce prince, s&#x27;occupait de magie et du culte de démons, mens une vie pure, et observa rigoureusement l&#x27;abstinence et le jeùne.&quot; (&quot;This prince, who occupied himself with magic and the cult of demons, led a pure life, and rigorously observed abstinence and fasting.&quot;)

Shōkō had no heirs of his own; and for this reason, Emperor Go-Komatsu selected Shōkō&#x27;s third cousin for Shōkō to adopt as heir. This cousin would accede to the Chrysanthemum Throne at age 10 as Emperor Go-Hanazono on September 7, 1428 (&quot;Shōchō 1, 29th day of the 7th month&quot;): Emperor Go-Hanazono accedes to the throne at age 10.

He is enshrined with other emperors at the imperial tomb at Fukakusa no kita no &quot;Misasagi&quot; (深草北陵) in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto.

===Kugyō===
&quot;Kugyō&quot; (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Shōkō&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included: 
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;
* &quot;Nadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

==Eras of Shōkō&#x27;s reign==
The years of Shōkō&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.
* &quot;Ōei&quot; (1394–1428)
* &quot;Shōchō&quot; (1428–1429)

<text>Punitive damages, or exemplary damages, are damages assessed in order to punish the defendant for outrageous conduct and/or to reform or deter the defendant and others from engaging in conduct similar to that which formed the basis of the lawsuit. Although the purpose of punitive damages is not to compensate the plaintiff, the plaintiff will receive all or some of the punitive damages in award.

Punitive damages are often awarded if compensatory damages are deemed to be an inadequate remedy by themselves. The court may impose them to prevent undercompensation of plaintiffs and to allow redress for undetectable torts and taking some strain away from the criminal justice system. Punitive damages are most important for violations of the law that are hard to detect.

However, punitive damages awarded under court systems that recognize them may be difficult to enforce in jurisdictions that do not recognize them. For example, punitive damages awarded to one party in a US case would be difficult to get recognition for in a European court in which punitive damages are most likely to be considered to violate ordre public.

Because they are usually paid in excess of the plaintiff&#x27;s provable injuries, punitive damages are awarded only in special cases, usually under tort law, if the defendant&#x27;s conduct was egregiously insidious. Punitive damages cannot generally be awarded in contract disputes. The main exception is in insurance bad faith cases in the US if the insurer&#x27;s breach of contract is alleged to be so egregious as to amount to a breach of the &quot;implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing&quot;, and is therefore considered to be a &quot;tort&quot; cause of action eligible for punitive damages (in excess of the value of the insurance policy).

==National applications==

===Australia===
In Australia, punitive damages are not available for breach of contract, but are possible for tort cases.

The law is less settled regarding equitable wrongs. In &quot;Harris v Digital Pulse Pty Ltd&quot;, the defendant employees knowingly breached contractual and fiduciary duties to their employer by diverting business to themselves and misusing its confidential information. The New South Wales Court of Appeal held that punitive damages are not available both for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. Heydon JA (as he then was) said there is no power to give punitive damages in respect of a claim in equity, although he was content to decide the case on the narrower ground that there is no power to award punitive damages for the specific equitable wrong in issue. Spigelman CJ concurred, although he emphasized that the contractual character of the fiduciary relationship in question, and refrained from deciding on whether punitive damages would be available in respect of equitable wrongs more analogous to torts. Mason P dissented and opined that there was no principled reason to award punitive damages in respect of common law torts but not analogous equitable wrongs.

===Canada===
In Canada, punitive damages may be awarded in exceptional cases for &quot;malicious, oppressive and high-handed&quot; misconduct. The Supreme Court of Canada set out 11 principles to guide judges and juries for awarding punitive damages in the leading case &quot;Whiten v Pilot Insurance Co&quot; 2002 SCC 18. The principles are not intended to form a checklist or be mandatory, but instead is to be considered based on the facts of each case.

===England and Wales===
In England and Wales, exemplary damages in tort cases are limited to cases in which at least one of the circumstances set out by Lord Devlin in the leading case of &quot;Rookes v Barnard&quot; has been met:

#Oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional actions by the servants of government.
#Where the defendant&#x27;s conduct was &#x27;calculated&#x27; to make a profit for himself.
#Where a statute expressly authorises the same.

&quot;Rookes v Barnard&quot; has been much criticised and has not been followed in Canada, Australia or New Zealand, despite English cases often being influential in other Commonwealth countries and with the Privy Council. It was strongly criticised by the Court of Appeal in &quot;Broome v Cassell&quot;, but on appeal the House of Lords upheld &quot;Rookes v Barnard&quot;.

The second &quot;Rookes&quot; category—where punitive damages are allowed to remedy conduct by a defendant calculated to make a profit—was applied in a defamation context in &quot;Broome v Cassell&quot;, and is frequently used in tort actions by tenants against landlords, as well as in cases of insurance fraud.

Examples of statutory authorisation of punitive damages (the third &quot;Rookes&quot; category) include section 34 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013, which allows claimants to seek, and courts to grant, exemplary damages against news media publishers when they show a &quot;a deliberate or reckless disregard of an outrageous nature for the claimant&#x27;s rights&quot;. Some judicial dispute exists as to whether statutory provisions Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (and predecessors thereof) amount to a statutory authorisation.

Exemplary damages go beyond the philosophical aims of a contractual remedy and are not available as damages for breach of contract. Lord Atkinson said, in &quot;Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd&quot;:

In 1997 the Law Commission recommended that punitive damages should never be available for breach of contract.

===Germany===
German courts do not award punitive damages and consider foreign punitive damages unenforceable to the extent that the payment would exceed the damages plus an allowance for reasonable defence costs big enough so that the plaintiff would get a full reimbursement of its loss but not more.

===Japan===
Japanese courts do not award punitive damages as a matter of public policy, and Japanese law prohibits the enforcement of punitive damage awards obtained overseas.

In Japan, medical negligence and other species of negligence are governed by the criminal code, which may impose much harsher penalties than civil law. For instance, many causes of action which would subject a defendant to a potential punitive damage award in the U.S. would subject the same individual to prison time in Japan.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand it was held in &quot;Donselaar v. Donselaar&quot; and confirmed in &quot;Auckland City Council v. Blundell&quot; that the existence of the Accident Compensation Corporation did not bar the availability of exemplary damages. In &quot;Paper Reclaim Ltd v Aotearoa International Ltd&quot; it was held that exemplary damages are not to be awarded in actions for breach of contract but the court left open the possibility that exemplary damages might be available where the breach of contract is a tort.

In 2010, in &quot;Couch v Attorney-General&quot; the New Zealand Supreme Court barred exemplary damages for cases of negligence unless the defendant acts intentionally or with subjective recklessness.

Punitive damages can also be awarded for equitable wrongs. In &quot;Acquaculture Corporation v New Zealand Green Mussel Co Ltd&quot;, the majority of the New Zealand Court of Appeal held that in addition to compensation, punitive damages could be awarded for breach of confidence, albeit that, on the facts, they were not merited. Similarly, in &quot;Cook v Evatt (No.2)&quot;, Fisher J in the New Zealand High Court added exemplary damages of NZ$5,000 to an account of profits of over NZ$20,000 for breach of fiduciary duty.

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===
In very few industries, punitive damages could be awarded in either contractual or tort case, except a tort relevant to product defraud or defect. Article 49 of the PRC Law on Protection of Consumer Rights and Interests enacted on October 31, 1993, provides the rule that any consumer is entitled to a recovery of double the purchase price of products or service from the seller or service provider against their defraud. Successful cases have been widely reported in this regard.

Article 96 of the PRC Law on Food Safety adopted on February 28, 2009, raises the punitive damages to ten times the purchase price added to the compensatory damages that the victim has already claimed from the producer or seller for food with poor quality not compliant to food safety standards. Such a substantial statutory amount considered by the legislative organ is based on several extremely serious food quality incidents in the past two years, such as the notorious Sanlu tainted milk powder case.

Application of the punitive damage rule is further expanded with the enactment of the PRC Law on Tort Liability effective as of July 1, 2010. This new law sets forth that a victim is entitled to claim punitive damages from any manufacturer or seller expressly aware of the defects in products but still produces or sells them if it results in death or heavy injuries. Since this is a somewhat new law so far, no further explanatory regulation regarding a detailed amount and applicable scope is promulgated guiding the application of this rule, so a court judge may have discretional power to decide punitive damages case by case under this new law.

===United States===
Punitive damages are a settled principle of common law in the United States. They are generally a matter of state law (although they can also be awarded under federal maritime law), and thus differ in application from state to state. In many states, including California and Texas, punitive damages are determined based on statute; elsewhere, they may be determined solely based on case law. Many state statutes are the result of insurance industry lobbying to impose &quot;caps&quot; on punitive damages; however, several state courts have struck down these statutory caps as unconstitutional. They are rare, occurring in only 6% of civil cases that result in a monetary award. Punitive damages are entirely unavailable under any circumstances in a few jurisdictions, including Nebraska, Puerto Rico, and Washington.

The general rule is that punitive damages cannot be awarded for breach of contract, but if an independent tort is committed in a contractual setting, punitive damages can be awarded for the tort. Although state laws vary, punitive damages are usually allowed only when the defendant has displayed actual &quot;intent&quot; to cause harm (such as purposefully rear-ending someone else&#x27;s car), rather than in cases of mere negligence, or causes an injury through action taken in reckless disregard for the lives and safety of others.

Punitive damages are a focal point of the tort reform debate in the United States, where numerous highly publicized multimillion-dollar verdicts have led to a fairly common perception that punitive damage awards tend to be excessive. However, statistical studies by law professors and the Department of Justice have found that punitive damages are only awarded in two percent of civil cases which go to trial, and that the median punitive damage award is between $38,000 and $50,000.

There is no maximum dollar amount of punitive damages that a defendant can be ordered to pay. In response to judges and juries which award high punitive damages verdicts, the Supreme Court of the United States has made several decisions which limit awards of punitive damages through the due process of law clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. In a number of cases, the Court has indicated that a 4:1 ratio between punitive and compensatory damages is high enough to lead to a finding of constitutional impropriety and that any ratio of 10:1 or higher is almost certainly unconstitutional. However, the Supreme Court carved out a notable exception to this rule of proportionality in the case of &quot;TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp.&quot;, where it affirmed an award of $10 million in punitive damages, despite the compensatory damages being only $19,000, a punitive-to-compensatory ratio of more than 526-to-1. In this case, the Supreme Court affirmed that disproportionate punitive damages were allowed for especially egregious conduct.

In the case of &quot;Liebeck v. McDonald&#x27;s Restaurants&quot; (1994), 79-year-old Stella Liebeck spilled McDonald&#x27;s coffee in her lap which resulted in second and third-degree burns on her thighs, buttocks, groin and genitals. The burns were severe enough to require skin grafts. Liebeck attempted to have McDonald&#x27;s pay her $20,000 medical bills as indemnity for the incident. McDonald&#x27;s refused, and Liebeck sued. During the case&#x27;s discovery process, internal documents from McDonald&#x27;s revealed the company had received hundreds of similar complaints from customers claiming McDonald&#x27;s coffee caused severe burns. At trial, this led the jury to find McDonald&#x27;s knew their product was dangerous and injuring their customers, and that the company had done nothing to correct the problem. The jury decided on $200,000 in compensatory damages, but attributed 20 percent of the fault to Liebeck, reducing her compensation to $160,000. The jury also awarded Liebeck $2.7 million in punitive damages, which was at the time two days of McDonald&#x27;s coffee sales revenue. The judge later reduced the punitive damages to $480,000. The case is often criticized for the very high amount of damages the jury awarded. Nevertheless, many legal scholars and documentary film makers like &quot;Hot Coffee&quot; argued that corporate lobbyists seized the opportunity to create public misinformation and distrust of the legal system by leaving out important facts in their television advertisements, such as, that the verdict was roughly equivalent to two days of coffee sales for McDonald&#x27;s, that Liebeck received permanent injury to her genitals and groin requiring surgery, and that McDonald&#x27;s had already received numerous complaints about the temperature of the coffee.

In &quot;BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore&quot; (1996), the Supreme Court ruled that an excessive punitive award can amount to an arbitrary deprivation of property in violation of due process. The court held that punitive damages must be reasonable, as determined by the degree of reprehensibility of the conduct that caused the plaintiff&#x27;s injury, the ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages, and any comparable criminal or civil penalties applicable to the conduct. In &quot;State Farm Auto. Ins. v. Campbell&quot; (2003), the Supreme Court held that punitive damages might only be based on the acts of the defendants which harmed the plaintiffs. The court also elaborated on the factors courts must apply when reviewing a punitive award under due process principles.

Most recently, in &quot;Philip Morris USA v. Williams&quot; (2007), the Supreme Court ruled that punitive damage awards cannot be imposed for the direct harm that the misconduct caused others, but may consider harm to others as a function of determining how reprehensible it was. More reprehensible misconduct justifies a larger punitive damage award, just as a repeat offender in criminal law may be punished with a tougher sentence. Dissenting in the &quot;Williams&quot; case, Justice John Paul Stevens found that the &quot;nuance eludes me&quot;, suggesting that the majority had resolved the case on a distinction that makes no difference.

Punitive damages are subjective by their very nature. Since their purpose is to punish—as opposed to compensate—opinions on how to accomplish this will vary widely among jurors. Regardless, research into punitive damages has revealed some common principles. Wealth of the defendant is positively correlated with large punitive damage awards, jurors either downplay or ignore jury instructions regarding punitive damages determinations, and jurors tend to punish defendants who have conducted a cost-benefit analysis.

<doc id="47167" wikidata="Q4048565" url="?curid=47167" title="Route flapping">
<text>In computer networking and telecommunications, route flapping occurs when a router alternately advertises a destination network via one route then another, or as unavailable and then available again, in quick sequence. 

==Condition==
Route flapping is caused by pathological conditions (hardware errors, software errors, configuration errors, intermittent errors in communications links, unreliable connections, etc.) within the network which cause certain reachability information to be repeatedly advertised and withdrawn. For example, link flap occurs when an interface on a router has a hardware failure that causes the router to announce it alternately as &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot;.

In networks with link-state routing protocols, route flapping will force frequent recalculation of the topology by all participating routers. In networks with distance-vector routing protocols, route flapping can trigger routing updates with every state change. In both cases, it prevents the network from converging.

Route flapping can be contained to a smaller area of the network if route aggregation is used. As an aggregate route will not be withdrawn as long as at least one of the aggregated subnets is still valid, a flapping route that is part of an aggregate will not disturb the routers that receive the aggregate.

<text>A Navy Directory, Navy List or Naval Register is an official list of naval officers, their ranks and seniority, the ships which they command or to which they are appointed, etc., that is published by the government or naval authorities of a country.

==Background==
A Navy List fulfills an important function in international law in that warships are required by article 29 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to be commanded by a commissioned officer whose name appears in the appropriate service list. Past copies of the Navy List are also important sources of information for historians and genealogists. When a ship is removed from the navy list of any country, the ship is said to be &quot;stricken&quot; (from the list).

The British Royal Navy publishes annual lists of active and reserve officers, and biennial lists of retired officers. In 2016 &quot;The Navy List&quot;, which had been officially published under that name since 1814, was renamed &quot;The Navy Directory&quot;. The equivalent in the United States Navy is the &quot;Naval Vessel Register&quot;, which is updated online on a continuous basis.

<text>Misanthropy is the general hatred, dislike, or distrust of the human species, human behavior, or human nature. A misanthrope or misanthropist is someone who holds such views or feelings. Misanthropy involves a negative evaluative attitude toward humanity that is based on humankind&#x27;s flaws. Misanthropes hold that these flaws characterize all or at least the greater majority of human beings. They claim that there is no easy way to rectify them short of a complete transformation of the dominant way of life. Various types of misanthropy are distinguished in the academic literature based on what attitude is involved, at whom it is directed, and how it is expressed. Either emotions or theoretical judgments can serve as the foundation of the attitude. It can be directed toward all humans without exception or exclude a few idealized people. In this regard, some misanthropes condemn themselves while others consider themselves superior to everyone else. Misanthropy is sometimes associated with a destructive outlook aiming to hurt other people or an attempt to flee society. Other types of misanthropic stances include activism by trying to improve humanity, quietism in the form of resignation, and humor mocking the absurdity of the human condition.

The negative misanthropic outlook is based on different types of human flaws. Moral flaws and unethical decisions are often seen as the foundational factor. They include cruelty, selfishness, injustice, greed, and indifference to the suffering of others. They may result in harm to humans and animals, such as genocides and factory farming of livestock. Other flaws include intellectual flaws, like dogmatism and cognitive biases, as well as aesthetic flaws concerning ugliness and lack of sensitivity to beauty. Many debates in the academic literature discuss whether misanthropy is a valid viewpoint and what its implications are. Proponents of misanthropy usually point to human flaws and the harm they have caused as a sufficient reason for condemning humanity. Critics have responded to this line of thought by claiming that severe flaws concern only a few extreme cases, like mentally ill perpetrators, but not humanity at large. Another objection is based on the claim that humans also have virtues besides their flaws and that a balanced evaluation might be overall positive. A further criticism rejects misanthropy because of its association with hatred, which may lead to violence, and because it may make people friendless and unhappy. Defenders of misanthropy have responded by claiming that this applies only to some forms of misanthropy but not to misanthropy in general.

A related issue concerns the question of the psychological and social factors that cause people to become misanthropes. They include socio-economic inequality, living under an authoritarian regime, and undergoing personal disappointments in life. Misanthropy is relevant in various disciplines. It has been discussed and exemplified by philosophers throughout history, like Heraclitus, Diogenes, Thomas Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Friedrich Nietzsche. Misanthropic outlooks form part of some religious teachings discussing the deep flaws of human beings, like the Christian doctrine of original sin. Misanthropic perspectives and characters are also found in literature and popular culture. They include William Shakespeare&#x27;s portrayal of Timon of Athens, Molière&#x27;s play &quot;The Misanthrope&quot;, and &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; by Jonathan Swift. Misanthropy is closely related to but not identical to philosophical pessimism. Some misanthropes promote antinatalism, the view that humans should abstain from procreation.

== Definition ==
Misanthropy is traditionally defined as hatred or dislike of humankind. The word originated in the 17th century and has its roots in the Greek words &quot;mīsos&quot; &#x27;hatred&#x27; and &quot;ānthropos&quot; &#x27;man, human&#x27;. In contemporary philosophy, the term is usually understood in a wider sense as a negative evaluation of humanity as a whole based on humanity&#x27;s vices and flaws. This negative evaluation can express itself in various forms, hatred being only one of them. In this sense, misanthropy has a cognitive component based on a negative assessment of humanity and is not just a blind rejection. Misanthropy is usually contrasted with philanthropy, which refers to the love of humankind and is linked to efforts to increase human well-being, for example, through good will, charitable aid, and donations. Both terms have a range of meanings and do not necessarily contradict each other. In this regard, the same person may be a misanthrope in one sense and a philanthrope in another sense.

One central aspect of all forms of misanthropy is that their target is not local but ubiquitous. This means that the negative attitude is not just directed at some individual persons or groups but at humanity as a whole. In this regard, misanthropy is different from other forms of negative discriminatory attitudes directed at a particular group of people. This distinguishes it from the intolerance exemplified by misogynists, misandrists, and racists, which hold a negative attitude toward women, men, or certain races. According to literature theorist Andrew Gibson, misanthropy does not need to be universal in the sense that a person literally dislikes every human being. Instead, it depends on the person&#x27;s horizon. For instance, a villager who loathes every other villager without exception is a misanthrope if their horizon is limited to only this village.

Both misanthropes and their critics agree that negative features and failings are not equally distributed, i.e. that the vices and bad traits are exemplified much more strongly in some than in others. But for misanthropy, the negative assessment of humanity is not based on a few extreme and outstanding cases: it is a condemnation of humanity as a whole that is not just directed at exceptionally bad individuals but includes regular people as well. Because of this focus on the ordinary, it is sometimes held that these flaws are obvious and trivial but people may ignore them due to intellectual flaws. Some see the flaws as part of human nature as such. Others also base their view on non-essential flaws, i.e. what humanity has come to be. This includes flaws seen as symptoms of modern civilization in general. Nevertheless, both groups agree that the relevant flaws are &quot;entrenched&quot;. This means that there is either no or no easy way to rectify them and nothing short of a complete transformation of the dominant way of life would be required if that is possible at all.

== Types ==
Various types of misanthropy are distinguished in the academic literature. They are based on what attitude is involved, how it is expressed, and whether the misanthropes include themselves in their negative assessment. The differences between them often matter for assessing the arguments for and against misanthropy. An early categorization suggested by Immanuel Kant distinguishes between &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; misanthropes. Positive misanthropes are active enemies of humanity. They wish harm to other people and undertake attempts to hurt them in one form or another. Negative misanthropy, by contrast, is a form of peaceful anthropophobia that leads people to isolate themselves. They may wish others well despite seeing serious flaws in them and prefer to not involve themselves in the social context of humanity. Kant associates negative misanthropy with moral disappointment due to previous negative experiences with others.

Another distinction focuses on whether the misanthropic condemnation of humanity is only directed at other people or at everyone including oneself. In this regard, &quot;self-inclusive&quot; misanthropes are consistent in their attitude by including themselves in their negative assessment. This type is contrasted with &quot;self-aggrandizing&quot; misanthropes, who either implicitly or explicitly exclude themselves from the general condemnation and see themselves instead as superior to everyone else. In this regard, it may be accompanied by an exaggerated sense of self-worth and self-importance. According to literature theorist Joseph Harris, the self-aggrandizing type is more common. He states that this outlook seems to undermine its own position by constituting a form of hypocrisy. A closely related categorization developed by Irving Babbitt distinguishes misanthropes based on whether they allow exceptions in their negative assessment. In this regard, &quot;misanthropes of the naked intellect&quot; regard humanity as a whole as hopeless. &quot;Tender misanthropes&quot; exclude a few idealized people from their negative evaluation. Babbitt cites Rousseau and his fondness for natural uncivilized man as an example of tender misanthropy and contrasts it with Jonathan Swift&#x27;s thorough dismissal of all of humanity.

A further way to categorize forms of misanthropy is in relation to the type of attitude involved toward humanity. In this regard, philosopher Toby Svoboda distinguishes the attitudes of dislike, hate, contempt, and judgment. A misanthrope based on dislike harbors a distaste in the form of negative feelings toward other people. Misanthropy focusing on hatred involves an intense form of dislike. It includes the additional component of wishing ill upon others and at times trying to realize this wish. In the case of contempt, the attitude is not based on feelings and emotions but on a more theoretical outlook. It leads misanthropes to see other people as worthless and look down on them while excluding themselves from this assessment. If the misanthropic attitude has its foundation in judgment, it is also theoretical but does not distinguish between self and others. It is the view that humanity is in general bad without implying that the misanthrope is in any way better than the rest. According to Svoboda, only misanthropy based on judgment constitutes a serious philosophical position. He holds that misanthropy focusing on contempt is biased against other people while misanthropy in the form of dislike and hate is difficult to assess since these emotional attitudes often do not respond to objective evidence.

=== Misanthropic forms of life ===
Misanthropy is usually not restricted to a theoretical opinion but involves an evaluative attitude that calls for a practical response. It can express itself in different forms of life. They come with different dominant emotions and practical consequences for how to lead one&#x27;s life. These responses to misanthropy are sometimes presented through simplified archetypes that may be too crude to accurately capture the mental life of any single person. Instead, they aim to portray common attitudes among groups of misanthropes. The two responses most commonly linked to misanthropy involve either destruction or fleeing from society. The destructive misanthrope is said to be driven by a hatred of humankind and aims at tearing it down, with violence if necessary. For the fugitive misanthrope, fear is the dominant emotion and leads the misanthrope to seek a secluded place in order to avoid the corrupting contact with civilization and humanity as much as possible.

The contemporary misanthropic literature has also identified further less-known types of misanthropic lifestyles. The activist misanthrope is driven by hope despite their negative appraisal of humanity. This hope is a form of meliorism based on the idea that it is possible and feasible for humanity to transform itself and the activist tries to realize this ideal. A weaker version of this approach is to try to improve the world incrementally to avoid some of the worst outcomes without the hope of fully solving the basic problem. Activist misanthropes differ from quietist misanthropes, who take a pessimistic approach toward what the person can do for bringing about a transformation or significant improvements. In contrast to the more drastic reactions of the other responses mentioned, they resign themselves to quiet acceptance and small-scale avoidance. A further approach is focused on humor based on mockery and ridicule at the absurdity of the human condition. An example is that humans hurt each other and risk future self-destruction for trivial concerns like a marginal increase in profit. This way, humor can act both as a mirror to portray the terrible truth of the situation and as its palliative at the same time.

== Forms of human flaws ==
A core aspect of misanthropy is that its negative attitude toward humanity is based on human flaws. Various misanthropes have provided extensive lists of flaws, including cruelty, greed, selfishness, wastefulness, dogmatism, self-deception, and insensitivity to beauty. These flaws can be categorized in many ways. It is often held that moral flaws constitute the most serious case. Other flaws discussed in the contemporary literature include intellectual flaws, aesthetic flaws, and spiritual flaws.
Moral flaws are usually understood as tendencies to violate moral norms or as mistaken attitudes toward what is the good. They include cruelty, indifference to the suffering of others, selfishness, moral laziness, cowardice, injustice, greed, and ingratitude. The harm done because of these flaws can be divided into three categories: harm done directly to humans, harm done directly to other animals, and harm done indirectly to both humans and other animals by harming the environment. Examples of these categories include the Holocaust, factory farming of livestock, and pollution causing climate change. In this regard, it is not just relevant that human beings cause these forms of harm but also that they are morally responsible for them. This is based on the idea that they can understand the consequences of their actions and could act differently. However, they decide not to, for example, because they ignore the long-term well-being of others in order to get short-term personal benefits.

Intellectual flaws concern cognitive capacities. They can be defined as what leads to false beliefs, what obstructs knowledge, or what violates the demands of rationality. They include intellectual vices, like arrogance, wishful thinking, and dogmatism. Further examples are stupidity, gullibility, and cognitive biases, like the confirmation bias, the self-serving bias, the hindsight bias, and the anchoring bias. Intellectual flaws can work in tandem with all kinds of vices: they may deceive someone about having a vice. This prevents the affected person from addressing it and improving themselves, for instance, by being mindless and failing to recognize it. They also include forms of self-deceit, wilful ignorance, and being in denial about something. Similar considerations have prompted some traditions to see intellectual failings, like ignorance, as the root of all evil.

&quot;Aesthetic flaws&quot; are usually not given the same importance as moral and intellectual flaws, but they also carry some weight for misanthropic considerations. These flaws relate to beauty and ugliness. They concern ugly aspects of human life itself, like defecation and aging. Other examples are ugliness caused by human activities, like pollution and litter, and inappropriate attitudes toward aesthetic aspects, like being insensitive to beauty.

== Causes ==
Various psychological and social factors have been identified in the academic literature as possible causes of misanthropic sentiments. The individual factors by themselves may not be able to fully explain misanthropy but can show instead how it becomes more likely. For example, disappointments and disillusionments in life can cause a person to adopt a misanthropic outlook. In this regard, the more idealistic and optimistic the person initially was, the stronger this reversal and the following negative outlook tend to be. This type of psychological explanation is found as early as Plato&#x27;s Phaedo. In it, Socrates considers a person who trusts and admires someone without knowing them sufficiently well. He argues that misanthropy may arise if it is discovered later that the admired person has serious flaws. In this case, the initial attitude is reversed and universalized to apply to all others, leading to general distrust and contempt toward other humans. Socrates argues that this becomes more likely if the admired person is a close friend and if it happens more than once. This form of misanthropy may be accompanied by a feeling of moral superiority in which the misanthrope considers themselves to be better than everyone else.

Other types of negative personal experiences in life may have a similar effect. Andrew Gibson uses this line of thought to explain why some philosophers became misanthropes. He uses the example of Thomas Hobbes to explain how a politically unstable environment and the frequent wars can foster a misanthropic attitude. Regarding Arthur Schopenhauer, he states that being forced to flee one&#x27;s home at an early age and never finding a place to call home afterward can have a similar effect. Another psychological factor concerns negative attitudes toward the human body, especially in the form of general revulsion from sexuality.

Besides the psychological causes, some wider social circumstances may also play a role. Generally speaking, the more negative the circumstances are, the more likely misanthropy becomes. For instance, according to political scientist Eric M. Uslaner, socio-economic inequality in the form of unfair distribution of wealth increases the tendency to adopt a misanthropic perspective. This has to do with the fact that inequality tends to undermine trust in the government and others. Uslaner suggests that it may be possible to overcome or reduce this source of misanthropy by implementing policies that build trust and promote a more equal distribution of wealth. The political regime is another relevant factor. This specifically concerns authoritarian regimes using all means available to repress their population and stay in power. For example, it has been argued that the severe forms of repression of the Ancien Régime in the late 17th century made it more likely for people to adopt a misanthropic outlook because their freedom was denied. Democracy may have the opposite effect since it allows more personal freedom due to its more optimistic outlook on human nature.

Empirical studies often use questions related to trust in other people to measure misanthropy. This concerns specifically whether the person believes that others would be fair and helpful. In an empirical study on misanthropy in American society, Tom W. Smith concludes that factors responsible for an increased misanthropic outlook are low socioeconomic status, being from racial and ethnic minorities, and having experienced recent negative events in one&#x27;s life. In regard to religion, misanthropy is higher for people who do not attend church and for fundamentalists. Some factors seem to play no significant role, like gender, having undergone a divorce, and never having been married. Another study by Morris Rosenberg finds that misanthropy is linked to certain political outlooks. They include being skeptical about free speech and a tendency to support authoritarian policies. This concerns, for example, tendencies to suppress political and religious liberties.

== Arguments ==

Various discussions in the academic literature concern the question of whether misanthropy is an accurate assessment of humanity and what the consequences of adopting it are. Many proponents of misanthropy focus on human flaws together with examples of when they exercise their negative influences. They argue that these flaws are so severe that misanthropy is an appropriate response.

Special importance in this regard is usually given to moral faults. This is based on the idea that humans do not merely cause a great deal of suffering and destruction but are also morally responsible for them. The reason is that they are intelligent enough to understand the consequences of their actions and could potentially make balanced long-term decisions instead of focusing on personal short-term gains.

Proponents of misanthropy sometimes focus on extreme individual manifestations of human flaws, like mass killings ordered by dictators. Others emphasize that the problem is not limited to a few cases, for example, that many ordinary people are complicit in their manifestation by supporting the political leaders committing them. A closely related argument is to claim that the underlying flaws are there in everyone, even if they reach their most extreme manifestation only in a few. Another approach is to focus not on the grand extreme cases but on the ordinary small-scale manifestations of human flaws in everyday life, such as lying, cheating, breaking promises, and being ungrateful.

Some arguments for misanthropy focus not only on general tendencies but on actual damage caused by humans in the past. This concerns, for instance, damages done to the ecosystem, like ecological catastrophes resulting in mass extinctions.

=== Criticism ===
Various theorists have criticized misanthropy. Some opponents acknowledge that there are extreme individual manifestations of human flaws, like mentally ill perpetrators, but claim that these cases do not reflect humanity at large and cannot justify the misanthropic attitude. For instance, while there are cases of extreme human brutality, like the mass killings committed by dictators and their forces, listing such cases is not sufficient for condemning humanity at large.

Some critics of misanthropy acknowledge that humans have various flaws but state that they present just one side of humanity while evaluative attitudes should take all sides into account. This line of thought is based on the idea that humans possess equally important virtues that make up for their shortcomings. For example, accounts that focus only on the great wars, cruelties, and tragedies in human history ignore its positive achievements in the sciences, arts, and humanities.

Another explanation given by critics is that the negative assessment should not be directed at humanity but at some social forces. These forces can include capitalism, communism, patriarchy, racism, religious fundamentalism, or imperialism. Supporters of this argument would adopt an opposition to one of these social forces rather than a misanthropic opposition to humanity.

Some objections to misanthropy are based not on whether this attitude appropriately reflects the negative value of humanity but on the costs of accepting such a position. The costs can affect both the individual misanthrope and the society at large. This is especially relevant if misanthropy is linked to hatred, which may turn easily into violence against social institutions and other humans and may result in harm. Misanthropy may also deprive the person of most pleasures by making them miserable and friendless.

Another form of criticism focuses more on the theoretical level and claims that misanthropy is an inconsistent and self-contradictory position. An example of this inconsistency is the misanthrope&#x27;s tendency to denounce the social world while still being engaged in it and being unable to fully leave it behind. This criticism applies specifically to misanthropes who exclude themselves from the negative evaluation and look down on others with contempt from an arrogant position of inflated ego but it may not apply to all types of misanthropy. A closely related objection is based on the claim that misanthropy is an unnatural attitude and should therefore be seen as an aberration or a pathological case.

== In various disciplines ==

=== History of philosophy ===
Misanthropy has been discussed and exemplified by philosophers throughout history. One of the earliest cases was the pre-Socratic philosopher Heraclitus. He is often characterized as a solitary person who is not fond of social interactions with others. A central factor to his negative outlook on human beings was their lack of comprehension of the true nature of reality. This concerns especially cases in which they remain in a state of ignorance despite having received a thorough explanation of the issue in question. Another early discussion is found in Plato&#x27;s Phaedo, where misanthropy is characterized as the result of frustrated expectations and excessively naïve optimism.
Various reflections on misanthropy are also found in the cynic school of philosophy. There it is argued, for instance, that humans keep on reproducing and multiplying the evils they are attempting to flee. An example given by the first-century philosopher Dio Chrysostom is that humans move to cities to defend themselves against outsiders but this process thwarts their initial goal by leading to even more violence due to high crime rates within the city. Diogenes is a well-known cynic misanthrope. He saw other people as hypocritical and superficial. He openly rejected all kinds of societal norms and values, often provoking others by consciously breaking conventions and behaving rudely.

Thomas Hobbes is an example of misanthropy in early modern philosophy. His negative outlook on humanity is reflected in many of his works. For him, humans are egoistic and violent: they act according to their self-interest and are willing to pursue their goals at the expense of others. In their natural state, this leads to a never-ending war in which &quot;every man to every man ... is an enemy&quot;. He saw the establishment of an authoritative state characterized by the strict enforcement of laws to maintain order as the only way to tame the violent human nature and avoid perpetual war.

A further type of misanthropy is found in Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He idealizes the harmony and simplicity found in nature and contrasts them with the confusion and disorder found in humanity, especially in the form of society and institutions. For instance, he claims that &quot;Man is born free; and everywhere he is in chains&quot;. This negative outlook was also reflected in his lifestyle: he lived solitary and preferred to be with plants rather than humans.

Arthur Schopenhauer is often mentioned as a prime example of misanthropy. According to him, everything in the world, including humans and their activities, is an expression of one underlying will. This will is blind, which causes it to continuously engage in futile struggles. On the level of human life, this &quot;presents itself as a continual deception&quot; since it is driven by pointless desires. They are mostly egoistic and often result in injustice and suffering to others. Once they are satisfied, they only give rise to new pointless desires and more suffering. In this regard, Schopenhauer dismisses most things that are typically considered precious or meaningful in human life, like romantic love, individuality, and liberty. He holds that the best response to the human condition is a form of asceticism by denying the expression of the will. This is only found in rare humans and &quot;the dull majority of men&quot; does not live up to this ideal.

Friedrich Nietzsche, who was strongly influenced by Schopenhauer, is also often cited as an example of misanthropy. He saw man as a decadent and &quot;sick animal&quot; that shows no progress over other animals. He even expressed a negative attitude toward apes since they are more similar to human beings than other animals, for example, with regard to cruelty. For Nietzsche, a noteworthy flaw of human beings is their tendency to create and enforce systems of moral rules that favor weak people and suppress true greatness. He held that the human being is something to be overcome and used the term Übermensch to describe an ideal individual who has transcended traditional moral and societal norms.

=== Religion ===

Some misanthropic views are also found in religious teachings. In Christianity, for instance, this is linked to the sinful nature of humans and the widespread manifestation of sin in everyday life. Common forms of sin are discussed in terms of the seven deadly sins. Examples are an excessive sense of self-importance in the form of pride and strong sexual cravings constituting lust. They also include the tendency to follow greed for material possessions as well as being envious of the possessions of others. According to the doctrine of original sin, this flaw is found in every human being since the doctrine states that human nature is already tainted by sin from birth by inheriting it from Adam and Eve&#x27;s rebellion against God&#x27;s authority. John Calvin&#x27;s theology of Total depravity has been described by some theologians as misanthropic.

Misanthropic perspectives can also be discerned in various Buddhist teachings. For example, Buddha had a negative outlook on the widespread flaws of human beings, including lust, hatred, delusion, sorrow, and despair. These flaws are identified with some form of craving or attachment (taṇhā) and cause suffering (dukkha). Buddhists hold that it is possible to overcome these failings in the process of achieving Buddhahood or enlightenment. However, this is seen as a difficult achievement, meaning that these failings apply to most human beings.

However, there are also many religious teachings opposed to misanthropy, such as the emphasis on kindness and helping others. In Christianity, this is found in the concept of agape, which involves selfless and unconditional love in the form of compassion and a willingness to help others. Buddhists see the practice of loving kindness (metta) as a central aspect that implies a positive intention of compassion and the expression of kindness toward all sentient beings.

=== Literature and popular culture ===
Many examples of misanthropy are also found in literature and popular culture. Timon of Athens by William Shakespeare is a famous portrayal of the life of the Ancient Greek Timon, who is widely known for his extreme misanthropic attitude. Shakespeare depicts him as a wealthy and generous gentleman. However, he becomes disillusioned with his ungrateful friends and humanity at large. This way, his initial philanthropy turns into an unrestrained hatred of humanity, which prompts him to leave society in order to live in a forest. Molière&#x27;s play &quot;The Misanthrope&quot; is another famous example. Its protagonist, Alceste, has a low opinion of the people around him. He tends to focus on their flaws and openly criticizes them for their superficiality, insincerity, and hypocrisy. He rejects most social conventions and thereby often offends others, for example, by refusing to engage in social niceties like polite small talk.
The author Jonathan Swift had a reputation for being misanthropic. In some statements, he openly declares that he hates and detests &quot;that animal called man&quot;. Misanthropy is also found in many of his works. An example is &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, which tells the adventures of the protagonist Gulliver, who journeys to various places, like an island inhabited by tiny people and a land ruled by intelligent horses. Through these experiences of the contrast between humans and other species, he comes to see more and more the deep flaws of humanity, leading him to develop a revulsion toward other human beings. Ebenezer Scrooge from Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; is an often-cited example of misanthropy. He is described as a cold-hearted, solitary miser who detests Christmas. He is greedy, selfish, and has no regard for the well-being of others. Other writers associated with misanthropy include Gustave Flaubert and Philip Larkin.

The Joker from the DC Universe is an example of misanthropy in popular culture. He is one of the main antagonists of Batman and acts as an agent of chaos. He believes that people are selfish, cruel, irrational, and hypocritical. He is usually portrayed as a sociopath with a twisted sense of humor who uses violent means to expose and bring down organized society.

=== Philosophical pessimism ===
Misanthropy is closely related but not identical to philosophical pessimism. Philosophical pessimism is the view that life is not worth living or that the world is a bad place, for example, because it is meaningless and full of suffering. This view is exemplified by Arthur Schopenhauer and Philipp Mainländer. Philosophical pessimism is often accompanied by misanthropy if the proponent holds that humanity is also bad and partially responsible for the negative value of the world. However, the two views do not require each other and can be held separately. A non-misanthropic pessimist may hold, for instance, that humans are just victims of a terrible world but not to blame for it. Eco-misanthropists, by contrast, may claim that the world and its nature are valuable but that humanity exerts a negative and destructive influence.

=== Antinatalism and human extinction ===
Antinatalism is the view that coming into existence is bad and that humans have a duty to abstain from procreation. A central argument for antinatalism is called the misanthropic argument. It sees the deep flaws of humans and their tendency to cause harm as a reason for avoiding the creation of more humans. These harms include wars, genocides, factory farming, and damages done to the environment. This argument contrasts with philanthropic arguments, which focus on the future suffering of the human about to come into existence. They argue that the only way to avoid their future suffering is to prevent them from being born. The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement and the Church of Euthanasia are well-known examples of social movements in favor of antinatalism and human extinction.

Antinatalism is commonly endorsed by misanthropic thinkers. However, there are numerous other ways that could lead to the involuntary extinction of the human species, with various suggestions having been made about threats to the long-term survival of the human species, including nuclear wars, self-replicating nanorobots, or super-pathogens. While such cases can be seen as terrible scenarios for all life, misanthropes may instead interpret them as reasons for hope that the dominance of humanity in history will eventually come to an end. A similar sentiment is expressed by Bertrand Russell. He states in relation to the existence of human life on earth and its misdeeds that they are &quot;a passing nightmare; in time the earth will become again incapable of supporting life, and peace will return.&quot;

=== Human exceptionalism and deep ecology ===
Human exceptionalism is the claim that human beings have unique importance and are exceptional compared to all other species. It is often based on the claim that they stand out because of their special capacities, like intelligence, rationality, and autonomy. In religious contexts, it is frequently explained in relation to a unique role that God foresaw for them or that they were created in God&#x27;s image. Human exceptionalism is usually combined with the claim that human well-being matters more than the well-being of other species. This line of thought can be used to draw various ethical conclusions. One is the claim that humans have the right to rule the planet and impose their will on other species. Another is that inflicting harm on other species may be morally acceptable if it is done with the purpose of promoting human well-being and excellence.

Generally speaking, the position of human exceptionalism is at odds with misanthropy in relation to the value of humanity. But this is not necessarily the case and it may be possible to hold both positions at the same time. One way to do this is to claim that humanity is exceptional because of a few rare individuals but that the average person is bad. Another approach is to hold that human beings are exceptional in a negative sense: given their destructive and harmful history, they are much worse than any other species.

Theorists in the field of deep ecology are also often critical of human exceptionalism and tend to favor a misanthropic perspective. Deep ecology is a philosophical and social movement that stresses the inherent value of nature and advocates a radical change in human behavior toward nature. Various theorists have criticized deep ecology based on the claim that it is misanthropic by privileging other species over humans. For example, the deep ecology movement Earth First! faced severe criticism when they praised the AIDS epidemic in Africa as a solution to the problem of human overpopulation in their newsletter.

<text>Pope Paul II (; ; 23 February 1417 – 26 July 1471), born Pietro Barbo, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 30 August 1464 to his death. When his maternal uncle became Pope Eugene IV, Barbo switched from training to be a merchant to religious studies. His rise in the Church was relatively rapid. Elected pope in 1464, Paul amassed a great collection of art and antiquities.

==Early life==
Pietro Barbo was born in Venice, the son of Niccolò Barbo and wife Polissena Condulmer. His mother was the sister of Pope Eugene IV (1431–1447). Through his father he was a member of the noble Barbo family. His adoption of the spiritual career, after having been trained as a merchant, was prompted by his uncle&#x27;s election as pope. His consequent promotion was rapid. He became Archdeacon of Bologna, and Bishop of Cervia and of Vicenza, and in 1440 became a cardinal-deacon. While he was in Rome, Vicenza was administered by his brother, Paolo Barbo. Barbo gained popularity through his generosity. He might have boasted that if elected pope he would buy each cardinal a villa to escape the summer heat.

After having been lay abbot of Santa Maria in Sylvis since 1441, in 1445 he succeeded Giuliano Cesarini as archpriest of the Vatican Basilica. Barbo was very influential under Eugene IV, Nicholas V, and Calixtus III, but less so under Pius II. Barbo had a marked propensity to enjoy dressing up in sumptuous ecclesiastical finery.

==Election==

Barbo was elected to succeed Pope Pius II by the accessus in the first ballot of the papal conclave of 30 August 1464 with a majority of fourteen of the nineteen cardinals present. He owed his election in part to the dissatisfaction of some of the cardinals with the policy of his predecessor.

Upon taking office, Paul II was to convene an ecumenical council within three years. But these terms of subscription were modified by Paul II at his own discretion, and this action lost him the confidence of the College of Cardinals. The justification for setting aside the capitulations, seen to be under way by the Duke of Milan&#x27;s ambassador as early as 21 September, lay in connecting any abridgement of the Pope&#x27;s absolute monarchy in the Papal States with a consequent abridgement of his sole authority in spiritual matters. Almost from his coronation, Paul withdrew and became inaccessible: audiences were only granted at night and even good friends waited a fortnight to see him. His suspiciousness was widely attested.

Paul wore rouge in public. The story of Cardinal Ammanati that he meant to take the name Formosus II (meaning &quot;handsome&quot;), after Pope Formosus, but was persuaded not to, is more often repeated than the story that he was dissuaded from &quot;Marcus&quot;, being Venetian and the Cardinal of San Marco, because it was also the war-cry of Venice. He had a papal tiara made for his own use studded with &quot;diamonds, sapphires, emeralds, topaz, large pearls, and every kind of precious gem&quot;. He built the Palazzo San Marco (now the Palazzo Venezia) and lived there even as pope, amassing a great collection of art and antiquities.

==Conflict==

A sore point was his abuse of the practice of creating cardinals &quot;in pectore&quot;, without publishing their names. Eager to raise new cardinals to increase the number who were devoted to his interests, but restricted by the terms of the capitulation, which gave the college a voice in the creation of new members, in the winter of 1464–65 Paul created two secret cardinals both of whom died before their names could be published. In his fourth year as Pope, he created eight new cardinals on 18 September 1467. Five were candidates pressed by kings, placating respectively James II of Cyprus, Edward IV of England, Louis XI of France, Matthias Corvinus of Hungary and Ferdinand I of Naples; one was the able administrator of the Franciscans; and the last two elevated his old tutor and a first cardinal-nephew. Two further cardinal-nephews were added on 21 November 1468. In a sign of his increasing secretiveness and paranoia, he added two more cardinals secretly at the same consistory, and four more at the beginning of 1471, expecting to reveal them only in his testament.

Tensions came to the fore when in attempting to eliminate redundant offices, Paul II proceeded to annul the college of Abbreviators, whose function it was to formulate papal documents; a storm of indignation arose, inasmuch as rhetoricians and poets with humanist training, had long been accustomed to benefiting from employment in such positions. Paul proceeded as well against the Roman Academy. Bartolomeo Platina was a member of both and found his papal employment abruptly curtailed. He wrote a pamphlet insolently demanding the pope recall his restrictions, and was imprisoned in the winter of 1464, but released four months later.

In February 1468, when Rome was rife with political intrigue fomented by the Roman barons and the neighboring princes, Paul II arrested Platina and other members of the academy on charges of irreligion, immorality, and an alleged conspiracy to assassinate the Pope. The prisoners were interrogated under torture and eventually released.

After his release on 7 July 1469, Platina expected to be again in the employ of Paul II, who, however, declined his services. Platina threatened vengeance and executed his threat, when at the suggestion of Pope Sixtus IV he later wrote his &quot;Vitæ Pontificum Platinæ historici liber de vita Christi ac omnium pontificum qui hactenus ducenti fuere et XX&quot; (1479). Not unaccountably, Platina set forth an unfavorable delineation of the character of Paul II.

Among other things, Platina reported that Pius II suggested Barbo should have been called &quot;Maria Pietissima&quot;, as &quot;when he could not obtain what he aimed at by praying, entreating, and requesting, he would join tears to his petitions to make them the sooner believed.&quot; Some historians have suggested the nickname may also have been a possible allusion to a perceived lack of masculinity, reflecting possible homosexuality. Platina also paints his enemy as cruel, and an archenemy of science. For centuries it influenced historical opinions until critical research proved otherwise.

Though Platina&#x27;s writing after the conflict would tarnish the legacy of Paul II, the conflict would prove to have a greater effect on the intellectual environment of Rome. Peter Partner explains, &quot;Probably its most important result was to convince men of letters that cultural conformity would be enforced in Rome.&quot; More tangibly, after the crackdown of Paul II, the Roman Academy took on a more religious flavour, turning in part to theology as a means of legitimizing its pursuits.

==Final years==

Pope Paul rejected George of Poděbrady (King George of Bohemia) because he upheld the conventions of the Council of Basel in favour of the Utraquists. In August 1465, Paul II summoned George before the Roman tribunal. When the King failed to come, Paul allied himself with the insurgents in Bohemia and released the King&#x27;s subjects from their oath of allegiance. In December 1466, he pronounced the ban of excommunication and sentence of deposition against George. George&#x27;s apologist, Gregory of Heimberg, subsequently accused Paul of immorality, a move that resulted in Gregory&#x27;s own excommunication.

Just when the King&#x27;s goodwill disposed the Pope in favor of reconciliation, Paul died suddenly of a heart attack on 26 July 1471. Reports of the death varied. Some claimed he had collapsed from severe indigestion after eating melon in excess. Some (mainly the pontiff&#x27;s critics) said that he had died whilst being sodomized by a page boy. Nevertheless, his death resulted in the creation of a power vacuum in Central Europe – especially after Poděbrady himself died in March of that same year.

==Legacy==

Although Paul II was a committed opponent of humanist learning, he oversaw and approved the introduction of printing into the Papal States, first at Subiaco in 1464 by Arnold Pannartz and Konrad Sweynheim, and at Rome itself in 1467. The result was that books and other documents became far more numerous and less expensive to procure than the previous handwritten manuscripts. Printing put the materials needed for an advanced education into the hands of more people than ever before, including an increasing number of laypeople. The output of printing presses at this period was, as a matter of course, subject to governmental scrutiny; during Paul II&#x27;s reign, books produced in the Papal States were largely limited to Latin classical literature and ecclesiastical texts.

The chronicler Stefano Infessura&#x27;s republican and anti-papal temper makes his diary a far from neutral though well-informed witness. But it is certain that although Paul II opposed the humanists, he yet provided for popular amusements: in 1466 he permitted the horse-race that was a feature of Carnival to be run along the main street, the Via Lata, which became known from this annual event as the Via del Corso. So that nobody felt left out of the event, the Pope instituted races for boys, adult men, old people and Jews, with appropriate prizes for each group. He tried to reduce or stop blood feuds and vendettas in Italy, and to make sure that Jews were treated fairly. Paul II displayed an extravagant love of personal splendor that gratified his sense of self-importance. After his death Sixtus IV and a selected group of cardinals inspected the treasure laid up against expenditures against the Turks: they found 54 silver shells filled with pearls, to a value of 300,000 ducats, jewels and gold intended for refashioning, worth another 300,000 ducats, and a magnificent diamond worth 7,000 ducats, which was sent to Cardinal d&#x27;Estouteville to cover monies he had advanced to the pontiff. The coin was not immediately found. He had also amassed a collection of 800 gemstones.

William Francis Barry considers that his character was &quot;misunderstood by the Italian courts which never dreamt that a Pope could be an honourable man&quot;.

In statecraft, Paul II lacked eminence and achieved nothing of consequence for Italy. In his own domain, however, he terminated the regime of the counts of Anguillara in 1465.

<text>Ruddigore; or, The Witch&#x27;s Curse, originally called Ruddygore, is a comic opera in two acts, with music by Arthur Sullivan and libretto by W. S. Gilbert. It is one of the Savoy Operas and the tenth of fourteen comic operas written together by Gilbert and Sullivan. It was first performed by the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company at the Savoy Theatre in London on 22 January 1887.

The first night was not altogether a success, as critics and the audience felt that &quot;Ruddygore&quot; (as it was then called) did not measure up to its predecessor, &quot;The Mikado&quot;. After some changes, including respelling the title, it achieved a run of 288 performances. The piece was profitable, and the reviews were not all bad. For instance, &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; praised the work of both Gilbert and, especially, Sullivan: &quot;Sir Arthur Sullivan has eminently succeeded alike in the expression of refined sentiment and comic humour. In the former respect, the charm of graceful melody prevails; while, in the latter, the music of the most grotesque situations is redolent of fun.&quot;

There were further changes and cuts, including a new overture, when Rupert D&#x27;Oyly Carte revived &quot;Ruddigore&quot; after the First World War. Although never a big money-spinner, it remained in the repertoire until the company closed in 1982. A centenary revival at Sadler&#x27;s Wells in London restored the opera to almost its original first-night state. In 2000, Oxford University Press published a scholarly edition of the score and libretto, edited by Sullivan scholar David Russell Hulme. This restores the work as far as possible to the state in which its authors left it and includes a substantial introduction that explains many of the changes, with appendices containing some music deleted early in the run. After the expiration of the British copyright on Gilbert and Sullivan works in 1961, and especially since the Sadler&#x27;s Wells production and recording, various directors have experimented with restoring some or all of the cut material in place of the 1920s D&#x27;Oyly Carte version.

==Background==
After &quot;The Mikado&quot; opened in 1885, Gilbert, as usual, promptly turned his thoughts to finding a subject for a next opera. Some of the plot elements of &quot;Ruddigore&quot; had been introduced by Gilbert in his earlier one-act opera, &quot;Ages Ago&quot; (1869), including the tale of the wicked ancestor and the device of the ancestors stepping out of their portraits. Heinrich Marschner&#x27;s 1828 opera, &quot;Der Vampyr&quot;, involves a Lord Ruthven who must abduct and sacrifice three maidens or die. Locals claim that the Murgatroyd ancestors in &quot;Ruddigore&quot; are based on the Murgatroyd family of East Riddlesden Hall, West Yorkshire. According to his biographers, Sidney Dark and Rowland Grey, Gilbert also drew on some of his earlier verse, the &quot;Bab Ballads&quot;, for some plot elements. The song &quot;I know a youth who loves a little maid&quot; can be traced back to the Bab Ballad &quot;The Modest Couple&quot;, in which the very shy and proper Peter and Sarah are betrothed but are reluctant to shake hands or sit side by side. Sir Roderic&#x27;s Act II song &quot;When the night wind howls&quot; had its forerunner in one of Gilbert&#x27;s verses published in &quot;Fun&quot; magazine in 1869:

&lt;poem&gt;Fair phantom, come! The moon&#x27;s awake,
The owl hoots gaily from its brake,
The blithesome bat&#x27;s a-wing.
Come, soar to yonder silent clouds;
The ether teems with peopled shrouds:
We&#x27;ll fly the lightsome spectre crowds,
Thou cloudy, clammy thing!&lt;/poem&gt;

The opera also includes and parodies elements of melodrama, popular at the Adelphi Theatre. There is a priggishly good-mannered poor-but-virtuous heroine, a villain who carries off the maiden, a hero in disguise and his faithful old retainer who dreams of their former glory days, the snake-in-the-grass sailor who claims to be following his heart, the wild, mad girl, the swagger of fire-eating patriotism, ghosts coming to life to enforce a family curse, and so forth. But Gilbert, in his customary topsy-turvy fashion, turns the moral absolutes of melodrama upside down: The hero becomes evil, the villain becomes good, and the virtuous maiden changes fiancés at the drop of a hat. The ghosts come back to life, foiling the curse, and all ends happily.

Sullivan delayed in setting &quot;Ruddigore&quot; to music through most of 1886. He had committed to a heavy conducting schedule and to compose a cantata, &quot;The Golden Legend&quot;, for the triennial Leeds Music Festival in October 1886. He also was squiring Fanny Ronalds to numerous social functions. Fortunately, &quot;The Mikado&quot; was still playing strongly, and Sullivan prevailed on Gilbert to delay production of &quot;Ruddigore&quot;. He got down to business in early November, however, and rehearsals began in December. During the Act II ghost scene, it would be impossible for the cast to see Sullivan&#x27;s baton when the stage was darkened for the Ancestors&#x27; reincarnation. A technological solution was found: Sullivan used a glass tube baton containing a platinum wire that glowed a dull red.

The opera encountered some criticism from audiences at its opening on 22 January 1887, and one critic wondered if the libretto showed &quot;signs of the failing powers of the author&quot;. After a run shorter than any of the earlier Gilbert and Sullivan operas premiered at the Savoy except &quot;Princess Ida&quot;, &quot;Ruddigore&quot; closed in November 1887 to make way for a revival of &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;. To allow the revival of the earlier work to be prepared at the Savoy, the last two performances of &quot;Ruddigore&quot; were given at the Crystal Palace, on 8 and 9 November. It was not revived in the lifetimes of the composer or author.

==Synopsis==

===Act I===

In the town of Rederring, in Cornwall, a chorus of professional bridesmaids frets that there have been no weddings for the last six months. All of the eligible young men are hopeful of a union with Rose Maybud, the prettiest maiden in the village, yet they are too timid to approach her. The desperate bridesmaids ask Rose&#x27;s aunt, Dame Hannah, if she would consider marrying, but she has vowed to remain eternally single. Many years previously, she had been betrothed to &quot;a god-like youth&quot; who turned out to be Sir Roderic Murgatroyd, one of the bad baronets of Ruddigore. Only on her wedding day had she discovered his true identity.

Dame Hannah tells the bridesmaids about the curse of Ruddigore. Centuries ago, Sir Rupert Murgatroyd, the first Baronet of Ruddigore, had persecuted witches. One of his victims, as she was burnt at the stake, cursed all future Baronets of Ruddigore to commit a crime every day, or perish in inconceivable agonies. Every Baronet of Ruddigore since then had fallen under the curse&#x27;s influence, and died in agony once he could no longer bring himself to continue a life of crime.

After the horrified bridesmaids exit, Dame Hannah greets her niece, Rose, and asks whether there is any young man in the village whom she could love. Rose, who takes her ideas of Right and Wrong from a book of etiquette, replies that all of the young men she meets are either too rude or too shy. Dame Hannah asks particularly about Robin Oakapple, a virtuous farmer, but Rose replies that he is too diffident to approach her, and the rules of etiquette forbid her from speaking until she is spoken to. Robin enters, claiming to seek advice from Rose about &quot;a friend&quot; who is in love. Rose says that she has such a friend too, but Robin is too shy to take the hint. Rose&#x27;s devotion to etiquette prevents her from taking the first step, and so they part.

Old Adam, Robin&#x27;s faithful servant, arrives and addresses Robin as Sir Ruthven (pronounced &quot;Rivven&quot;) Murgatroyd. Robin reveals that he is indeed Sir Ruthven, having fled his home twenty years previously to avoid inheriting the Baronetcy of Ruddigore and its attendant curse. He tells Adam never to reveal his true identity. Now Richard Dauntless, Robin&#x27;s foster-brother, arrives after ten years at sea. Robin tells him that he is afraid to declare his love to Rose, and Richard offers to speak to her on his behalf. When Richard sees Rose, however, he falls in love with her himself and proposes immediately. After consulting her book of etiquette, Rose accepts. When Robin finds out what has happened, he points out his foster-brother&#x27;s many flaws through a series of backhanded compliments. Realising her mistake, Rose breaks her engagement with Richard and accepts Robin.

Mad Margaret appears, dishevelled and crazed. She has been driven to madness by her love for Sir Despard Murgatroyd, the &quot;Bad Baronet&quot;. She is jealously seeking Rose Maybud, having heard that Sir Despard intends to carry Rose off as one of his daily &quot;crimes&quot;. Rose tells her, however, that she need not fear, as she is pledged to another. They leave just in time to avoid the arrival of the Bucks and Blades, who have come to court the village girls, followed by Sir Despard, who proceeds to frighten everyone away. He muses that, although he is forced by the family curse to commit a heinous crime every day, he commits the crime early, and for the rest of the day he does good works. Richard approaches him and discloses that Despard&#x27;s elder brother Ruthven is alive, calls himself Robin Oakapple, and is going to marry Rose later that day. The elated Despard declares himself free of the curse, as he can now transfer the baronetcy to his brother.

The village gathers to celebrate the nuptials of Rose and Robin. Sir Despard interrupts, revealing that Robin is his elder brother and must accept his rightful title as the Bad Baronet. Rose, horrified at Robin&#x27;s true identity, resolves to marry Despard – who refuses her: now free of the curse, the ex-baronet takes up with his old love and fiancée Mad Margaret, who is ecstatic. Rose then accepts Richard, as he &quot;is the only one that&#x27;s left.&quot; Robin leaves to take up his rightful identity as Sir Ruthven Murgatroyd.

===Act II===
At Ruddigore Castle, Robin (now Sir Ruthven) tries to come to grips with being a bad baronet, a task at which he proves to be spectacularly lacking. Old Adam suggests various evil crimes, but Robin prefers minor acts that are not criminal, but &quot;simply rude&quot;. Richard and Rose enter to ask Robin&#x27;s consent to their marriage, which he gives grudgingly.

Robin&#x27;s weak crimes stir his ancestral ghosts from their usual haunt of the castle&#x27;s portrait gallery. The curse requires them to ensure that their successors are duly committing a crime every day, and to torture them to death if they fail. They inquire as to Robin&#x27;s compliance with this requirement. They are not pleased to learn that the newly-recognised baronet&#x27;s crimes range from the underwhelming (filing a false income tax return: &quot;Nothing at all&quot;, say the ghosts; &quot;Everybody does that. It&#x27;s expected of you.&quot;) to the ridiculous (forging his own will and disinheriting his unborn son). Robin&#x27;s uncle, the late Sir Roderic Murgatroyd, orders him to &quot;carry off a lady&quot; that day or perish in horrible agony. After the ghosts treat him to a sample of the agonies he would face, Robin reluctantly agrees. He tells Adam to go to the village and abduct a lady – &quot;Any lady!&quot;

Despard, meanwhile, has atoned for his previous ten years of evil acts and has married Mad Margaret. The two of them now live a calm, dispassionate life of moderately-paid public service. They come to the castle and urge Robin to renounce his life of crime. When Robin asserts that he has done no wrong yet, they remind him that he is morally responsible for all the crimes Despard had done in his stead. Realising the extent of his guilt, Robin resolves to defy his ancestors.

Adam has now complied with Robin&#x27;s orders but has unfortunately chosen to abduct Dame Hannah. The dame proves formidable indeed, and Robin cries out for his uncle&#x27;s protection. Sir Roderic duly appears, recognises his former love and, angered that his former fiancée has been abducted, dismisses Robin. Left alone, he and Dame Hannah enjoy a brief reunion. Robin interrupts them, accompanied by Rose, Richard and the bridesmaids. He quibbles that, under the terms of the curse, a Baronet of Ruddigore can die only by refusing to commit a daily crime. Refusing is therefore &quot;tantamount to suicide&quot;, but suicide is, itself, a crime. Thus, he reasons, his predecessors &quot;ought never to have died at all.&quot;* Roderic follows this logic and agrees, stating that he is &quot;practically&quot; alive.

Now that Robin is free of the curse, Rose once again drops Richard and happily resumes her engagement to Robin. Roderic and Dame Hannah embrace, while Richard settles for the First Bridesmaid, Zorah.

* &quot;Note:&quot; In the original ending, all of the ghosts came back to life. In the revised ending substituted by Gilbert after the premiere, only Sir Roderic comes back to life.

==Premiere and reception==
The first night was not as successful as the other Savoy opera premieres because of controversy over the title and the revivification of the ghosts, and reservations about the plot and music. According to the &quot;St James&#x27;s Gazette&quot;, &quot;The first act was well received by the audience. Number after number was rapturously encored, and every droll sally of dialogue was received with a shout of appreciative mirth.&quot; The interval was long (a half hour) as the elaborate picture gallery needed to be set up, but D&#x27;Oyly Carte had anticipated this and had printed indulgence slips which were distributed. It was marked by noisy hubbub when Lord Randolph Churchill was spotted in the crowd, but a loud shout of &quot;No politics!&quot; brought relative calm. The second act, however, ended badly. On 23 January 1887, under the heading &quot;Their First Flat Failure; The First Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Not a Success&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported, &quot;When the curtain finally fell there was hissing – the first ever heard in the Savoy Theatre. The audience even voiced sentiments in words and there were shouts and cries such as these: &#x27;Take off this rot!&#x27; &#x27;Give us &quot;The Mikado&quot;!&#x27;&quot; The paper added, &quot;(T)he name is decidedly against it.&quot;

The performance was hampered by an off night for Leonora Braham as Rose Maybud and by George Grossmith&#x27;s usual first night jitters, a week after which he fell dangerously ill and had to be replaced by his understudy, Henry Lytton, for almost three weeks. Sullivan noted in his diary, &quot;Production of &quot;Ruddigore&quot; at Savoy. Very enthusiastic up to the last 20 minutes, then the audience showed dissatisfaction.&quot;

===Critical reception===
On the day of the premiere, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, whose correspondent attended the dress rehearsal the day before, warned, &quot;The music is not up to the standard of Sir Arthur Sullivan. As a whole it is largely commonplace ... Gilbert&#x27;s dialogue in the first act is here and there very amusing, but in the second it is slow and tedious.&quot; The press generally agreed with the Savoy audience that the second act of the premiere was inferior to the first. &quot;The Times&quot; opined that &quot;the fun which runs alive in the first act runs completely dry in the second, which is long and tedious, and winds up with an anti-climax of inanity.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; praised both the libretto and the music of the first act (&quot;Everything sparkles with the flashes of Mr. Gilbert&#x27;s wit and the graces of Sir Arthur Sullivan&#x27;s melodiousness... one is almost at a loss what to select for quotation from an embarrassment of humorous riches.&quot;) but rated the score, as a whole, &quot;of a fair average kind, being not equal to &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; but certainly superior to &quot;Princess Ida&quot;.&quot; &quot;Punch&quot; also thought the second act weak: &quot;The idea of the burlesque is funny to begin with, but not to go on with&quot;. The &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; thought the libretto &quot;as witty and fanciful as any of the series&quot; though &quot;the second half of the last act dragged a little.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported, &quot;the second (act) fell flat from the beginning and was a gloomy and tedious failure.&quot; According to the &quot;St. James&#x27;s Gazette&quot;, &quot;gradually the enthusiasm faded away and the interest of the story began to flag, until at last the plot seemed within an ace of collapsing altogether.&quot;

&quot;The Era&quot; commented, &quot;the libretto as a whole is very weak and loosely constructed.&quot; &quot;Fun&quot; asked, &quot;Could it be possible that we were to have a dull play from the cleverest and most original humorist of the day? Alas! It could – it was.&quot; According to the &quot;Pall Mall Budget&quot;, &quot;the players seemed to be nervous from the start. Miss Braham forgot her lines, and was not in voice. Mr. (George) Grossmith was in the same plight&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; also criticised Braham, stating that she &quot;acted most charmingly, but sang persistently out of tune&quot;. The staging was also criticised: &quot;The Times&quot; stated, &quot;The ghost scene ... of which preliminary notices and hints of the initiated had led one to expect much, was a very tame affair.&quot; &quot;The Era&quot; thought Sullivan&#x27;s score &quot;far from being fresh and spontaneous as is his wont&quot;.

Not all newspapers were adversely critical. &quot;The Sunday Express&quot; headlined its review &quot;Another Brilliant Success&quot;. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; agreed and stated that the work was &quot;received with every demonstration of delight by a distinguished and representative audience.&quot; &quot;The Observer&quot; also praised the piece, though allowing that it &quot;lacks something of the sustained brilliance&quot; of &quot;The Mikado&quot;. &quot;The Daily News&quot; applauded the innovation of Sullivan (who conducted, as usual, on the first night), of conducting with a baton tipped with a small incandescent light. Scholar Reginald Allen suggested that the reviews in the Sunday papers may have been better than the others because their critics, facing deadlines (the premiere was on Saturday night, and finished late because of the long interval), may not have stayed to the end. &quot;Fun&quot;, having disparaged the libretto, said of the music, &quot;Sir Arthur has surpassed himself&quot;. &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; praised the &quot;charming melodies, fresh and delightful as ever&quot;; &quot;The Daily News&quot; wrote that &quot;Mr Gilbert retains in all its fulness his unique facility for humorous satire and whimsical topsy-turveydom&quot; and praised Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;melodic genius which never fails&quot;. &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s Weekly Newspaper&quot; said, &quot;Sir Arthur Sullivan must be congratulated.&quot;

===Subsequent reviews and reception===
Subsequent reviews, written after Gilbert and Sullivan had renamed the show and made other changes, were generally more favourable. A week after the premiere, the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; praised the work, the actors and both Gilbert and, especially, Sullivan: &quot;Sir Arthur Sullivan has eminently succeeded alike in the expression of refined sentiment and comic humour. In the former respect, the charm of graceful melody prevails; while, in the latter, the music of the most grotesque situations is redolent of fun.&quot; On 1 February 1887, &quot;The Theatre&quot; wrote, &quot;There can be no doubt that by its admirable production of Messrs. Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s latest work the Savoy management has scored another of those shining and remunerative successes that its enterprise, intelligence, and good taste have repeatedly achieved – and merited.&quot; A week later, &quot;The Academy&quot; reckoned that &quot;Ruddygore&quot; (as it was still called in the review) was probably not so good as &quot;Patience&quot; or &quot;The Mikado&quot;, nor as &quot;fresh&quot; as &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, but &quot;it is better than ... &quot;Princess Ida&quot;, the &quot;Pirates&quot;, and &quot;Iolanthe&quot;&quot;. &quot;The Musical Times&quot; called the work &quot;one of the most brilliant examples which the associated art of Messrs. Gilbert and Sullivan has brought into existence,&quot; and said that Sullivan had &quot;written some of his freshest and most delightful melodies.&quot; However, in the view of &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, reviewing the Manchester premiere in March 1887, &quot;The weakness of his central idea has led Mr Gilbert into extravagance without wit and parody without point.&quot;

On 5 February 1887, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported the change of name to &quot;Ruddigore.&quot; &quot;In consequence of the criticisms on the piece, the second act has been changed. The pictures, with the exception of one, no longer come down from their frames. The houses are packed, as they always are in London, but the opinion is universal that the thing will be a worse failure in the provinces and America than &quot;Iolanthe&quot;.&quot; In a letter cabled to &quot;The New York Times&quot; and printed on 18 February, Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte denied that the piece was a failure, stating that box office receipts were running ahead of the same time period for &quot;The Mikado&quot;, despite the absence of the ailing Grossmith, who was by then recovering. He acknowledged that there had been &quot;isolated hisses&quot; on the first night because some audience members did not like the reappearance of the ghosts or a reference to the &quot;Supreme Court&quot; (according to D&#x27;Oyly Carte, misunderstood as &quot;Supreme Being&quot;) but asserted that both objections had been addressed by the removal of the offending material, and that audience reaction had been otherwise enthusiastic. He added, &quot;The theatre is crammed nightly.&quot;

The American productions met with mixed success. The demand for tickets for the first night was so great that the management of the Fifth Avenue Theatre sold them by public auction. A &quot;large and brilliant&quot; audience assembled for the New York premiere on 21 February 1887. &quot;After the first half of the first act there was a palpable diminution of interest on the part of the audience, and it must be admitted that there were times during the course of the evening when people were bored.&quot; While the critic had praise for many members of the cast and felt the production would improve once the cast was more familiar with the work, the reviewer concluded that &quot;Gilbert and Sullivan have failed.&quot; On the other hand, the American tour, beginning in Philadelphia six days later, met with a much more favourable audience reaction. &quot;That the opera is a great success here and another &quot;Mikado&quot; in prospective popularity there can be no question... The general verdict is that Sullivan never composed more brilliant music, while Gilbert&#x27;s keen satire and pungent humor is as brilliant as ever.&quot; During the summer of 1886, Braham secretly married J. Duncan Young, previously a principal tenor with the company. In early 1887, shortly into the run of &quot;Ruddigore&quot;, Braham informed Carte that she was pregnant with her second child, a daughter, who would be born on 6 May. Geraldine Ulmar, the Rose in the New York cast, was summoned to London to take over the role.

Gilbert ranked &quot;Ruddigore&quot; along with &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot; and &quot;Utopia, Limited&quot; as one of his three favourite Savoy operas. Later assessments have found much merit in the piece. After it was revived by the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera company in 1920, the work remained in their regular repertory, and it has generally been given a place in the regular rotation of other Gilbert and Sullivan repertory companies. By 1920, in a reappraisal of the piece, Samuel Langford wrote in &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; that &quot;the gruesome strain is the real Gilbertian element&quot; but &quot;the opera has abundant charm among its more forbidding qualities&quot;. In 1934 Hesketh Pearson rated the libretto among Gilbert&#x27;s best. In a 1937 review, &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; declared, 
In 1984, Arthur Jacobs rated &quot;Ruddigore&quot; &quot;One of the weaker of Gilbert&#x27;s librettos, it was seen (especially after the freshness of invention in &quot;The Mikado&quot;) to be rather obviously relying on brushed-up ideas... The plot is supposedly a burlesque of what was &#x27;transpontine&#x27; melodrama... But that brand of melodrama was itself hardly alive enough to be made fun of. As the &quot;Weekly Dispatch&quot; put it: &#x27;If stage work of the kind caricatured in &quot;Ruddygore or The Witch&#x27;s Curse&quot; is not extinct, it is relegated to regions unfrequented by the patrons of Mr D&#x27;Oyly Carte&#x27;s theatre&#x27;.&quot;

==Analysis of music and text==
===Musical content===
The Sullivan scholar Gervase Hughes characterised Sir Roderic&#x27;s song &quot;When the night wind howls&quot; as &quot;unquestionably the finest piece of descriptive music that Sullivan ever wrote, worthy of a place beside Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Erlkönig&quot;, Wagner&#x27;s overture to &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot;, and well above Saint-Saëns&#x27; &quot;Danse macabre&quot;, all of which are tone-paintings in a similar colour. Although the vocal score gives not a hint of the uncanny brilliance of the orchestration, it demonstrates the sure footholds by which the music in a round dozen bars finds its way from D minor to A flat major and back and the shattering impact of the fortissimo chorus entry at an interrupted cadence on the chord of B flat major. The progressions that follow look to be unusual, but if we study them carefully we realise that here Sullivan is not feeling his way in unfamiliar territory. Rather we may find in these few bars an apotheosis of his matured harmonic resource.&quot;
==Versions==
===Changes during the initial run===
After the unfavourable reception that the opera received on opening night, Gilbert and Sullivan made numerous significant cuts and alterations: Sullivan recorded in his diary:

* [23 January 1887]: Gilbert and Carte came. Pow-wow. Several changes and cuts decided on.
* [24 January]: Alterations made in finale [2nd act]: ghosts not brought back to life.
* [25 January]: Long rehearsal for cuts and changes (without band).
* [30 January] Wrote and scored new song (second act) for Grossmith.
* [31 January]: Busy all day. Went to American consulate to sign agreement for American &quot;Ruddygore&quot;. Finished score of new finale

Gilbert and Sullivan made the following changes:

* The initial title, &quot;Ruddygore&quot;, was changed: because of claims that &quot;ruddy&quot; was too similar to the then-taboo curse word &quot;bloody&quot;, it was shortly changed to &quot;Ruddigore&quot;. Gilbert&#x27;s response to being told they meant the same thing was: &quot;Not at all, for that would mean that if I said that I admired your ruddy countenance, which I do, I would be saying that I liked your bloody cheek, which I don&#x27;t.&quot;
* &quot;I once was as meek&quot; (No. 16) originally had two verses. In the cut second verse, Robin&#x27;s servant says that he has changed his name from Adam Goodheart to Gideon Crawle since he is now a &quot;bad Bart.&#x27;s steward.&quot; Old Adam is then referred to as &quot;Gideon Crawle&quot; or &quot;Gideon&quot; for the rest of Act II. After the cut, he remained Old Adam throughout, except for a single erroneous reference (&quot;Gideon Crawle, it won&#x27;t do!&quot;) which persisted in many librettos well into the 20th century.
* &quot;In bygone days&quot; (No. 18) was cut from two verses to one.
* &quot;Painted emblems of a race&quot; (No. 19) originally had two extra passages, including a March of the Ghosts after they descend from their frames, both of which were cut. (This alteration may have occurred before the premiere.) The dialogue between Robin and the ghosts afterwards was also shortened.
* The patter song after the recitative &quot;Away, remorse!&quot; (No. 21a) was changed from &quot;For thirty-five years I&#x27;ve been sober and wary&quot; to &quot;Henceforth all the crimes that I find in the Times&quot;. The rewriting of the song was prompted by a letter from Gilbert to Sullivan dated 23 January 1887: &quot;I can&#x27;t help thinking that the second act would be greatly improved if the recitation before Grossmith&#x27;s song were omitted and the song re-set to an air that would admit of his singing it desperately – almost in a passion, the torrent of which would take him off the stage at the end. After a long and solemn ghost scene, I fancy a lachrymose song is quite out of place&quot;.
* Despard&#x27;s and Margaret&#x27;s stated (in No. 22) place of employment was changed from &quot;a Sunday School&quot; to &quot;a National School&quot;.
* The dialogue scene among Robin, Despard and Margaret before the patter trio (No. 23) was shortened.
* The dialogue scene before &quot;There grew a little flower&quot; (No. 25) was considerably shortened; the first version exploring the topsy-turvy idea that if Sir Roderic and Dame Hannah were married, her husband would be a ghost, and she would therefore be a wife and a widow at the same time (this concept was recycled in &quot;The Grand Duke&quot;). Roderic originally entered through a trap door in the floor, where red flames could be seen shooting around him. This was changed to an entrance from the picture frame.
* The second revivification of the ghosts was dropped, with only Roderic being revived. Somewhat implausibly, this required the &quot;chorus of Bucks and Blades&quot; from Act I to be present at the castle at the end of Act II, to provide a four-part chorus for the finale.
* The finale was revised and extended, ending with a common-time reworking of &quot;Oh happy the lily&quot;, rather than a straight reprise as previously.

The original vocal score, published in March 1887, represented this revised version of the musical text. A 1987 recording by the New Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera, for which David Russell Hulme was adviser, restored most of the surviving material from the first-night version, including &quot;For thirty-five years I&#x27;ve been sober and wary&quot;, as well as the extra music from the ghost scene. The recording and the production were based in part on Hulme&#x27;s research, which also led to the 2000 Oxford University Press edition of the &quot;Ruddigore&quot; score, in which the music for some passages was published for the first time.

===Revisions in the 1920s===
&quot;Ruddigore&quot; was not revived professionally during the authors&#x27; lifetimes. When it received its first professional revival in December 1920 in Glasgow – and then in London, in October 1921 – the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company made a number of further cuts and changes that were incorporated in scores and used in subsequent D&#x27;Oyly Carte productions and recordings. David Russell Hulme, editor of the Oxford University Press 2000 scholarly edition of the score, has attributed the cuts and other changes to the music principally to Harry Norris, musical director of the D&#x27;Oyly Carte at the time of the Glasgow revival, and the modifications to the opera&#x27;s orchestration, as well as the new overture, to Geoffrey Toye. He concluded that some lesser changes may have been made by Malcolm Sargent, but in a few cases Hulme was uncertain as to which conductor was responsible for which change.

The most conspicuous changes were as follows:

* Geoffrey Toye, the D&#x27;Oyly Carte musical director for the first London revival in 1921, supplied a new overture to replace the original overture arranged by Hamilton Clarke.
* The playoffs to the Act I numbers &quot;Sir Rupert Murgatroyd&quot; (No. 2) and &quot;If somebody there chanced to be&quot; (No. 3) were shortened.
* In the Act I song &quot;My boy, you may take it from me&quot; (No. 7), the repetitions of the introduction were omitted, and only the last repeat with Richard was retained.
* The Act I duet &quot;The battle&#x27;s roar is over&quot; (No. 8) was cut.
* Some cuts were made within the Act I finale (No. 15) to shorten transitions between sections.
* Drum rolls and other orchestral effects were added to the ghost scene in Act II (Nos. 19–20)
* The Act II recitative and patter song &quot;Away, remorse&quot; ... &quot;Henceforth all the crimes&quot; (No. 21a) was cut.
* The &quot;Melodrame&quot; (No. 24) was cut.
* The Act II finale was replaced. The finale as composed and revised by Sullivan had consisted of &quot;When a man has been a naughty baronet&quot;, plus a modified reprise of &quot;Oh, happy the lily&quot; in 4/4 time. The replacement (ironically rather closer to Sullivan&#x27;s discarded original) was a straight reprise of &quot;Oh, happy the lily&quot; in the form it had taken in the Act I finale, in 9/8 time.

The standard Chappell vocal score was revised in the late 1920s to reflect these changes, except that the &quot;Melodrame&quot; and &quot;The battle&#x27;s roar is over&quot; continued to be printed. The G. Schirmer vocal score published in America agreed with the revised Chappell score, except that it also included Robin&#x27;s Act II recitative and patter song &quot;Henceforth all the crimes&quot; and both versions of the Act II finale.

The publication of the Oxford University Press edition in 2000 made it easier to restore passages deleted from the opera. Due to the many different editions available and the work&#x27;s complex textual history, there is no standard performing version of &quot;Ruddigore&quot;. Comparing the two extant overtures, Gervase Hughes wrote:

[T]he original overture to &quot;Ruddigore&quot; ... is a crude &quot;selection&quot; hardly redeemed by its spirited ending. The final cadence is by no means typical of Sullivan. In this overture a &quot;double chorus&quot; ... is taken complete from the opera – an unsatisfactory move because it vitiates its effect in the proper place. Nor is the orchestration of the passage particularly skilful. ... When &quot;Ruddigore&quot; was revived after some thirty-four years this jumble was found unsuitable ... and a new overture (which has been used ever since) was written by Geoffrey Toye. No precedents were followed and there is nothing Sullivanesque about it except the actual tunes; if one of them is momentarily developed in a manner that suggests a haunted ballroom rather than a haunted picture-gallery there is no great harm in that.

==Productions==
In contrast to its predecessor, &quot;The Mikado&quot;, &quot;Ruddigore&quot; had a comparatively short original run of 288 performances. The provincial tour was very brief, closing by early June 1887. Gilbert designed the ladies&#x27; and principals&#x27; costumes himself, while C. Wilhelm created the Ancestors&#x27; costumes. The set was by Hawes Craven. Six portraits of the ancestors that appeared in Act II of the original London production have survived and are on display at Normansfield Hospital Entertainment Hall, southwest London. A production in New York with D&#x27;Oyly Carte personnel ran for 53 performances. The opera was not revived during Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s lifetimes.

The first revival was in December 1920 in Glasgow, and the first London revival was the following year. The opera was cut and heavily revised, including a new overture and a new second-act finale. The revival was a success, and from that point on, &quot;Ruddigore&quot; was a permanent fixture in the D&#x27;Oyly Carte repertory until its closure in 1982. New costumes were designed by Percy Anderson in 1927. It was included in every season until the winter of 1940–41, when the scenery and costumes (along with those of three other operas) were destroyed in enemy action. In Australia, no authorised production of &quot;Ruddigore&quot; was seen until 23 June 1927, at the Theatre Royal, Adelaide, produced by the J. C. Williamson company. A new D&#x27;Oyly Carte production debuted on 1 November 1948, with new costumes and an Act II set designed by Peter Goffin. From then on, it was played in every season through 1976–77, aside from 1962–63 (a season that included a lengthy overseas tour). New touring sets were designed by Goffin in 1957. In the late 1970s, the Company started to play a reduced repertory. &quot;Ruddigore&quot; was included in the 1976–77 tour, then for five months in 1978–1979; and finally in 1981–82.

In 1987, the New Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera produced &quot;Ruddigore&quot; using a new edition of the text that restored many of the passages that prior productions had cut. Among recent professional productions, the Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company has mounted the opera at the Buxton Opera House, and both Britain&#x27;s Opera North and America&#x27;s New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players mounted well-regarded stagings in 2010. Opera North revived its production in 2011 and 2012.

The following table shows the history of the D&#x27;Oyly Carte productions in Gilbert&#x27;s lifetime:

==Historical casting==
The following tables show the casts of the principal original productions and D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company touring repertory at approximately 10-year intervals through to the company&#x27;s 1982 closure:

==Recordings==
The four D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company recordings (1924, 1931, 1950, 1962) substantially reflect the 1920s cuts and alterations, although they differ in some details. None of these four recordings include Robin&#x27;s Act II recitative and patter song. There is no commercial recording of &quot;Ruddigore&quot; as Gilbert and Sullivan left it, but the 1987 New Sadler&#x27;s Wells recording largely presents the opera with the materials that were included on its first night.

The Gilbert and Sullivan Discography judges that the best commercial recording is the New Sadler&#x27;s Wells disc and that, of those by the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company, the 1924 and 1962 recordings are best. It also asserts that the Brent Walker video of &quot;Ruddigore&quot; is one of the stronger entries in that series. More recent professional productions have been recorded on video by the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival.

==Adaptations and references in literature and culture ==
Adaptations of the opera have included the following.

* &quot;The Ghosts of Ruddigore&quot; by Opera della Luna
* &quot;Ruddy George, or Robin Redbreast&quot;, a burlesque with words by H.G.F. Taylor and music by Percy Reeve; it premiered at Toole&#x27;s Theatre on 26 March 1887 and ran for about 36 performances.

References in literature have included several novels in which the setting of the story involved a production of &quot;Ruddigore&quot;, such as &quot;Murder and Sullivan&quot; by Sara Hoskinson Frommer (1997) and &quot;Ruddy Gore&quot; by Kerry Greenwood (2004; the 7th Phryne Fisher book). &quot;The Ghosts&#x27; High Noon&quot; by John Dickson Carr (1969) was named for the song of the same name in &quot;Ruddigore&quot;. In &quot;Runaround&quot;, a story from Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;I, Robot&quot;, a robot in a state similar to drunkenness sings snippets of &quot;There Grew a Little Flower&quot;. In chapter 12 of John Myers Myers&#x27; novel &quot;Silverlock&quot; Sir Despard appears and admits that he fakes his evil acts; the locals are so used to this that he needs to pay the girls extra to scream when abducted.

Plot elements from G&amp;S operas entered subsequent musicals; for example, 1937&#x27;s &quot;Me and My Girl&quot; features a portrait gallery of ancestors that, like the portraits in &quot;Ruddigore&quot;, come alive to remind their descendant of his duty. The &quot;Matter Patter&quot; trio is used (with some changed lyrics) in Papp&#x27;s Broadway production of &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, and the tune of the song is used as &quot;The Speed Test&quot; in the musical &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot;. It is also sung in a season 5 episode of &quot;Spitting Image&quot; where Labour leader Neil Kinnock is portrayed singing a self-parody to the tune. The same song is pastiched in the documentary film &quot;&quot;. In the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Big Finish Productions audio, &quot;Doctor Who and the Pirates&quot;, songs from &quot;Ruddigore&quot; and other G&amp;S operas are parodied.

&quot;Ruddigore&quot; is mentioned in the law case of &quot;Banks v. District of Columbia Dep&#x27;t of Consumer &amp; Regulatory Affairs&quot;, 634 A.2d 433, 441 fn. 1 (D.C. 1993), which cites Ruddigore&#x27;s admonition to &quot;blow your own trumpet&quot;. A production of &quot;Ruddigore&quot; is the main plot point in &quot;Miss Fisher&#x27;s Murder Mysteries&quot;, Season 1 Episode 6, &quot;Ruddy Gore&quot;, based on the Phryne Fisher novel of the same name. The stars of the opera are being killed off in an effort to bankrupt the production company.

<text>Sándor Ferenczi (7 July 1873 – 22 May 1933) was a Hungarian psychoanalyst, a key theorist of the psychoanalytic school and a close associate of Sigmund Freud.

== Biography ==

Born Sándor Fränkel to Baruch Fränkel and Rosa Eibenschütz, both Polish Jews, he later magyarized his surname to &quot;Ferenczi&quot;.

As a result of his psychiatric work, he came to believe that his patients&#x27; accounts of sexual abuse as children were truthful, having verified those accounts through other patients in the same family. This was a major reason for his eventual disputes with Sigmund Freud.

Prior to this conclusion he was notable as a psychoanalyst for working with the most difficult of patients and for developing a theory of more active intervention than is usual for psychoanalytic practice. During the early 1920s, criticizing Freud&#x27;s &quot;classical&quot; method of neutral interpretation, Ferenczi collaborated with Otto Rank to create a &quot;here-and-now&quot; psychotherapy that, through Rank&#x27;s personal influence, led the American Carl Rogers to conceptualize person-centered therapy.

Ferenczi has found some favour in modern times among the followers of Jacques Lacan as well as among relational psychoanalysts in the United States. Relational analysts read Ferenczi as anticipating their own clinical emphasis on mutuality (intimacy), intersubjectivity, and the importance of the analyst&#x27;s countertransference. Ferenczi&#x27;s work has strongly influenced theory and praxis of the interpersonal-relational theory of American psychoanalysis, as typified by psychoanalysts at the William Alanson White Institute.

Ferenczi was president of the International Psychoanalytical Association from 1918 to 1919.

Ernest Jones, a biographer of Freud, termed Ferenczi as &quot;mentally ill&quot; at the end of his life, famously ignoring Ferenczi&#x27;s struggle with pernicious anemia, which killed him in 1933. Though desperately ill with the then-untreatable disease, Ferenczi managed to deliver his most famous paper, &quot;Confusion of Tongues&quot; to the 12th International Psycho-Analytic Congress in Wiesbaden, Germany, on 4 September 1932.

Ferenczi&#x27;s reputation was revived in 2002 by publication of &quot;Disappearing and Reviving: Sandor Ferenczi in the History of Psychoanalysis&quot;. One of the book&#x27;s chapters dealt with the nature of the relationship between Freud and Ferenczi.

== Ferenczi&#x27;s main ideas ==

=== Activity in psychoanalytic therapy ===

Contrary to Freud&#x27;s opinion of therapeutic abstinence, Ferenczi advocated a more active role for the analyst. For example, instead of the relative &quot;passivity&quot; of a listening analyst encouraging the patient to freely associate, Ferenczi used to curtail certain responses, verbal and non-verbal alike, on the part of the analysand so as to allow suppressed thoughts and feelings to emerge. described in a case study how he used a kind of behavioral activation (uncommon in the psychoanalytic therapy at that time) when he asked an opera singer with performance anxiety to “perform” during a therapy session and in this way to struggle with her fears.

=== Clinical empathy in psychoanalysis ===

Ferenczi believed the empathic response during therapy was the basis of clinical interaction. He based his intervention on responding to the subjective experience of the analysand. If the more traditional opinion
was that the analyst had the role of a physician, administering a treatment to the patient based upon diagnostic judgment of psychopathology, Ferenczi wanted the analysand to become a co-participant in an encounter created by the therapeutic dyad. This emphasis on empathic reciprocity during the therapeutic encounter was an important contribution to the evolution of psychoanalysis. Ferenczi also believed that self-disclosure of the analyst is an important therapeutic reparative force. The practice of including the therapist&#x27;s personality in therapy resulted in the development of the idea of mutual encounter: the therapist is allowed to discuss some content from his/her own life and thoughts, as long as it is relevant to the therapy. This is in contrast to the Freudian therapeutic abstinence according to which the therapist should not involve his/her personal life with the therapy, and should remain neutral. The mutual encounter is a precedent for the psychoanalytic theory of two-person psychology.

=== The &quot;confusion of tongues&quot; theory of trauma ===

Ferenczi believed that the persistent traumatic effect of chronic overstimulation, deprivation, or empathic failure (a term further elaborated by Heinz Kohut) during childhood is what causes neurotic, character, borderline and psychotic disorders. According to this concept, trauma develops as a result of the sexual seduction of a child by a parent or authority figure. The confusion of tongues occurs when the child pretends to be the spouse of the parent. The pathological adult interprets this infantile and innocent game according to his adult &quot;passion tongue&quot; and then forces the child to conform to his passion tongue. The adult uses a tongue the child does not know, and interprets the child&#x27;s innocent game (his infantile tongue) according to his disturbed perspective. For example, a father is playing with his little girl. During their common game, she offers him the role of her husband and wants him to sleep with her just as he sleeps with her mother. The pathological father misinterprets this childish offer, and touches his daughter in an inappropriate manner while they are in bed together. Here, the child spoke her innocent childish tongue, and the father interpreted her offer with his passionate adult sexual tongue.
The adult also attempts to convince the child that the lust on his part is really the love for which the child yearns. Ferenczi generalized the idea of trauma to emotional neglect, physical maltreatment, and empathic failure. The prominent manifestation of these disturbances would be the sexual abuse.

A Lacanian reading of Ferenczi&#x27;s &#x27;Confusion of Tongues&#x27; was published in 2018 by Miguel Gutiérrez-Peláez. Raluca Soreanu has investigated the metapsychological implications of &#x27;Confusion of Tongues&#x27; the &quot;Clinical Diary&quot; for a theory of psychic splitting.

=== &quot;Regressus ad uterum&quot; ===
In &quot;Thalassa: A Theory of Genitality&quot; (, 1924), Ferenczi suggested that the wish to return to the womb () and the comfort of its amniotic fluids symbolizes a wish to return to the origin of life, the sea. This idea of an &quot;uterine and thalassal regression&quot; became a feature of the so-called Budapest School, up to the disciple Michael Balint and his 1937 paper on &quot;Primary [Object-]Love&quot;. According to Ferenczi, all forms of human practice, especially sex, were an attempt to reestablish genitalia with the intrauterine experience – a theory which resonated with architect Richard Neutra and may have inspired, or supplemented, Neutra&#x27;s fascination with uterine suspension. At the same time, &quot;Thalassa&quot; is embedded in discourses of popular biology, which are reinterpreted by Ferenczi by using psychoanalytic models. Far from simply leaning on Ernst Haeckel, Wilhelm Bölsche, and post-Lamarckism to bolster the psychoanalytic paradigm, Ferenczi defamiliarizes these popular discourses just at a time when they were starting to inform eugenicist projects.

<text>Robert Lynn Asprin (June 28, 1946 – May 22, 2008) was an American science fiction and fantasy author and active fan, known best for his humorous series &quot;MythAdventures&quot; and &quot;Phule&#x27;s Company&quot;.

== Background ==
Robert Asprin was born in St. Johns, Michigan, and attended the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, Michigan from 1964 through 1965. From 1965 through 1966 he served in the United States Army. He was married, twice, and had two children. He was active in science fiction fandom and in the early years of the Society for Creative Anachronism using the name &quot;Yang the Nauseating&quot;, and co-initiated the society Great Dark Horde during 1971. He was also the initiator and an influential member of the Dorsai Irregulars. In 1976, he was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation for &quot;The Capture&quot;, a cartoon slide show written by Asprin and drawn by Phil Foglio.

== Early writing ==
Asprin&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Cold Cash War&quot;, an expansion of an earlier short story of the same title, was published in 1977.

During the next few years, he created and edited (with his then-wife, Lynn Abbey) the &quot;Thieves&#x27; World&quot; series of shared world anthologies, credited as the first project of its type. Many of the included authors later produced novels and stories of the theme which were not included in the anthologies, beginning with &quot;Beyond Sanctuary&quot; by Janet Morris, the first &quot;authorized&quot; Thieves World novel, published in 1985. Janet Morris and Chris Morris later produced two more authorized Thieves&#x27; World novels and a series of related novels about their character Tempus and the Sacred Band of Stepsons. A series of graphic novels followed during the mid-1980s, and several other authors, including Andrew J. Offutt and David Drake, published novels about their characters. In 2002, Lynn Abbey revived the series with the novel &quot;Sanctuary&quot;.

During 1978, Asprin began the &quot;MythAdventures&quot; series, chronicling the comic adventures of Skeeve and Aahz, with the book &quot;Another Fine Myth&quot;. Illustrated originally by Frank Kelly Freas, and later by Phil Foglio, the pun-rich books concern a &quot;demon&quot; magician who has lost his powers and his inexperienced human apprentice as they travel through a variety of worlds. Some of the early &quot;Myth&quot; novels were adapted later as comic books by Foglio and others. The Myth books have been published by three publishing companies over the years: Donning Starblaze, Meisha Merlin and, as of 2008, Wildside Press.

During the 1990s, Asprin&#x27;s &quot;Phule&quot; novels concerned the humorous science-fiction exploits of a rag-tag &quot;Space Legion&quot; and its wealthy and iconoclastic commander, Willard Phule.

== Hiatus in writing career ==
Due to a series of personal and financial problems, Asprin published little during the 1990s, although he had two books on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, which piqued the interest of fans and the Internal Revenue Service. He eventually negotiated an agreement with the IRS that encouraged him to resume writing, and during the early 2000s he published several novels, mostly in collaboration with authors Peter Heck, Jody Lynn Nye, and Linda Evans. These novels included continuations of the series &quot;Myth Adventures&quot; and &quot;Phule&#x27;s Company&quot; as well as works of new series.

== Later work ==
One of Asprin&#x27;s last projects was &quot;NO Quarter&quot;, originally co-authored with Eric Del Carlo, and later edited by Teresa Patterson. It is a dark fantasy/suspense/murder mystery novel set in the author&#x27;s beloved New Orleans French Quarter. Although the novel&#x27;s fantasy elements (voodoo and black magic, tarot readings and precognition, ghosts and mysticism) are secondary to the brutal murder that is the emphasis of the plot, it is set in the same milieu as Asprin&#x27;s Griffen McCandles novels (&quot;Dragons&quot; series), &quot;Dragons Luck&quot; and &quot;Dragons Wild&quot;. The two protagonists of &quot;NO Quarter&quot;, Maestro and Bone, also appear as minor characters of the &quot;Dragons&quot; novels. Maestro, the mysterious professional pool player and fencing master in &quot;NO Quarter&quot;, is fictionalized but based recognizably on the author. &quot;NO Quarter&quot; was published November 2009 by DarkStar Books.

Asprin&#x27;s ofttimes co-author, Jody Lynn Nye, has completed one further Griffen McCandles novel, &quot;Dragons Deal&quot;, and continued the &quot;Myth Adventures&quot; series. &quot;Dragons Deal&quot; was published by Ace in December 2010.

== Death and aftermath ==
Asprin died on May 22, 2008, of heart failure at his home in New Orleans. He was found lying on a sofa with a Terry Pratchett novel still open in his hands. He was to have been the Guest of Honor at Marcon that weekend.

During 2008, his heirs donated his archive to the department of Rare Books and Special Collections at Northern Illinois University.

<doc id="47183" wikidata="Q207448" url="?curid=47183" title="Monreale">
<text>Monreale (; ; Sicilian: Murriali) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the Metropolitan City of Palermo, in Sicily, Southern Italy. It is located on the slope of Monte Caputo, overlooking the very fertile valley called &quot;La Conca d&#x27;oro&quot; (the Golden Shell), a production area of orange, olive and almond trees, the produce of which is exported in large quantities. The town, which has a population of approximately 39,000, is about inland (south) of Palermo, the regional capital.

Monreale forms its own archdiocese and is home to Monreale Cathedral, a historical Norman-Byzantine cathedral, one of several buildings named in a UNESCO World Heritage Site, a group of nine inscribed as Arab-Norman Palermo and the Cathedral Churches of Cefalù and Monreale.

==History==

After the occupation of Palermo by the Arabs (the Emirate of Sicily), the Bishop of Palermo was forced to move his seat outside the capital. The role of a cathedral was assigned to a modest little church, &quot;Aghia Kiriaki&quot;, in a nearby village later known as Monreale. After the Norman conquest in 1072, Christians took back the former Palermo cathedral. Probably the village&#x27;s role as a temporary ecclesiastical centre played a part in King William II&#x27;s decision to build a cathedral here.

Monreale was a small village for a long time. When the Norman Kings of Sicily chose the area as their hunting resort, more people and commerce came to the area after the royalty built a palace (probably identifiable with the modern town hall).

Under King William II, a large monastery of Benedictines coming from Cava de&#x27; Tirreni, with its church, was founded and provided with large assets. The new construction also had an important defensive function. Monreale was the seat of the metropolitan archbishop of Sicily, which from then on exerted a significant influence over Sicily.

In the 19th century, underage marriages, or those performed without the blessing of the bride&#x27;s parents, were known as &quot;the marriages of Monreale&quot;, according to Eliza Lynn Linton. These referred to marriages performed in remote places, where the law was less observed. (see Gretna Green).

==Main sights== 

===The Cathedral===

The cathedral of Monreale is one of the greatest extant examples of Norman architecture. It was begun in 1174 by William II and completed four years later. In 1182 the church, dedicated to the Nativity of the Virgin Mary, was, by a bull of Pope Lucius III, elevated to the rank of a metropolitan cathedral.

The church is a national monument of Italy and one of the most important attractions of Sicily. Its size is 102 metres long and 47 meters wide. The façade is characterized by two large towers (one partially destroyed by lightning in 1807) and a portal with Romanesque bronze doors decorated by Bonanno Pisano. The interior is on the Latin cross plan, divided by ogival arcades, and features fresco cycles executed during the reigns of William II and Tancred of Sicily (c. 1194). The cloister has 228 small columns, each with different decorations influenced by Provençal, Burgundian, Arab and Salerno medieval art.

===Other sights===
*&quot;Castellaccio&quot; (&quot;Bad Castle&quot;), an example of a fortified convent on the Monte Caputo, at 764 m above sea level. It was built in the 12th century by King William II together with the Cathedral and the annexed monastery. It measures c. 80 x 30 m on an irregular plan with four towers on the western side, a middle tower and an entrance tower on the eastern side.
*Abbey church of San Martino delle Scale, founded in the 6th century AD. It is on the Latin cross plan with a dome, a choir with paintings by Paolo De Matteis (1727), two small side apses, chapels in the transept and ten chapels in each of the aisles. The interior was decorated in 1602 with stuccoes. The baptismal font near the sacristy is from 1396.
*Church of Collegiata (16th-19th centuries)
*Church of Santa Ciriaca
*Church of San Silvestro

==International relations==

<doc id="47185" wikidata="Q219407" url="?curid=47185" title="Ponzi scheme">
<text>A Ponzi scheme (, ) is a form of fraud that lures investors and pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors. Named after Italian businessman Charles Ponzi, this type of scheme misleads investors by either falsely suggesting that profits are derived from legitimate business activities (whereas the business activities are non-existent), or by exaggerating the extent and profitability of the legitimate business activities, leveraging new investments to fabricate or supplement these profits. A Ponzi scheme can maintain the illusion of a sustainable business as long as investors continue to contribute new funds, and as long as most of the investors do not demand full repayment or lose faith in the non-existent assets they are purported to own.

Some of the first recorded incidents to meet the modern definition of the Ponzi scheme were carried out from 1869 to 1872 by Adele Spitzeder in Germany and by Sarah Howe in the United States in the 1880s through the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Deposit&quot;. Howe offered a solely female clientele an 8% monthly interest rate and then stole the money that the women had invested. She was eventually discovered and served three years in prison. The Ponzi scheme was also previously described in novels; Charles Dickens&#x27;s 1844 novel &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot; and his 1857 novel &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; both feature such a scheme.

In the 1920s, Charles Ponzi carried out this scheme and became well known throughout the United States because of the huge amount of money that he took in. His original scheme was purportedly based on the legitimate arbitrage of international reply coupons for postage stamps, but he soon began diverting new investors&#x27; money to make payments to earlier investors and to himself. Unlike earlier similar schemes, Ponzi&#x27;s gained considerable press coverage both within the United States and internationally both while it was being perpetrated and after it collapsed – this notoriety eventually led to the type of scheme being named after him.

== Characteristics ==
In a Ponzi scheme, a con artist offers investments that promise very high returns with little or no risk to an investor. The returns are said to originate from a business or a secret idea run by the con artist. In reality, the business does not exist or the idea does not work in the way it is described or the extent of returns is made up or exaggerated. The con artist pays the high returns promised to their earlier investors by using the money obtained from later investors. Instead of engaging in a legitimate business activity, the con artist attempts to attract new investors to make the payments that were promised to earlier investors. The operator of the scheme also diverts clients&#x27; funds for the operator&#x27;s personal use.

With little or no legitimate earnings, Ponzi schemes require a constant flow of new money to survive. When it becomes hard to recruit new investors, or when large numbers of existing investors cash out, these schemes collapse. As a result, most investors end up losing much or all of the money they invested. In some cases, the operator of the scheme may simply disappear with the money.

== Red flags ==
According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), many Ponzi schemes share characteristics that should be &quot;red flags&quot; for investors.
* High investment returns with little or no risk. Every investment carries some degree of risk, and investments yielding higher returns typically involve more risk. Any &quot;guaranteed&quot; investment opportunity should be considered suspect.
* Overly consistent returns. Investment values tend to go up and down over time, especially those offering potentially high returns. An investment that continues to generate regular positive returns regardless of overall market conditions is considered suspicious.
* Unregistered investments. Ponzi schemes typically involve investments that have not been registered with financial regulators (like the SEC or the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)). Registration is important because it provides investors with access to key information about the company&#x27;s management, products, services, and finances.
* Unlicensed sellers. In the United States, federal and state securities laws require that investment professionals and their firms be licensed or registered. Most Ponzi schemes involve unlicensed individuals or unregistered firms.
* Secretive or complex strategies. Investments that cannot be understood or on which no complete information can be found or obtained are considered suspicious.
* Issues with paperwork. Account statement errors may be a sign that funds are not being invested as promised.
* Difficulty receiving payments. Investors should be suspicious of cases where they don&#x27;t receive a payment or have difficulty cashing out. Ponzi scheme promoters sometimes try to prevent participants from cashing out by offering even higher returns for staying put.

According to criminologist Marie Springer, the following red flags can also be of relevance:
* The sales personnel or adviser are overly pushy or aggressive (may involve high-pressure sales).
* The initial contact took place by a cold call or through a social network, a language-based radio or a religious radio advertisement. 
* The client cannot determine the actual trades or investments that have been carried out.
* The clients are asked to write checks with a different name than the name of the corporation (such as an individual) or to send checks to a different address than the corporate address.
* Once the maturity date of their investment arrives, clients are pressured to roll over the principal and the profits.

== Methods ==
Typically, Ponzi schemes require an initial investment and promise above-average returns. They use vague verbal guises such as &quot;hedge futures trading&quot;, &quot;high-yield investment programs&quot;, or &quot;offshore investment&quot; to describe their income strategy. It is common for the operator to take advantage of a lack of investor knowledge or competence, or sometimes claim to use a proprietary, secret investment strategy to avoid giving information about the scheme.

The basic premise of a Ponzi scheme is &quot;to rob Peter to pay Paul&quot;. Initially, the operator pays high returns to attract investors and entice current investors to invest more money. When other investors begin to participate, a cascade effect begins. The schemer pays a &quot;return&quot; to initial investors from the investments of new participants, rather than from genuine profits.

Often, high returns encourage investors to leave their money in the scheme, so that the operator does not actually have to pay very much to investors. The operator simply sends statements showing how much they have earned, which maintains the deception that the scheme is an investment with high returns. Investors within a Ponzi scheme may face difficulties when trying to get their money out of the investment.

Operators also try to minimize withdrawals by offering new plans to investors where money cannot be withdrawn for a certain period of time in exchange for higher returns. The operator sees new cash flows as investors cannot transfer money. If a few investors do wish to withdraw their money in accordance with the terms allowed, their requests are usually promptly processed, which gives the illusion to all other investors that the fund is solvent and financially sound.

Ponzi schemes sometimes begin as legitimate investment vehicles, such as hedge funds that can easily degenerate into a Ponzi-type scheme if they unexpectedly lose money or fail to legitimately earn the returns expected. The operators fabricate false returns or produce fraudulent audit reports instead of admitting their failure to meet expectations, from which point on the operation can be considered a Ponzi scheme.

A wide variety of investment vehicles and strategies, typically legitimate, have become the basis of Ponzi schemes. For instance, Allen Stanford used bank certificates of deposit to defraud tens of thousands of people. Certificates of deposit are usually low-risk and insured instruments, but the Stanford certificates of deposit were fraudulent.

== Unraveling ==
Theoretically, it is possible for certain Ponzi schemes to ultimately &quot;succeed&quot; financially, at least as long as a Ponzi scheme was not what the promoters were initially intending to operate. For example, a failing hedge fund reporting fraudulent returns could conceivably &quot;make good&quot; its reported numbers, for example by making a successful high-risk investment. Moreover, if the operators of such a scheme are facing the likelihood of imminent collapse accompanied by criminal charges, they may see little additional &quot;risk&quot; to themselves in attempting to cover their tracks by engaging in further illegal acts to try and make good the shortfall (for example, by engaging in insider trading). Especially with investment vehicles like hedge funds that are regulated and monitored less heavily than other investment vehicles such as mutual funds, in the absence of a whistleblower or accompanying illegal acts, any fraudulent content in reports is often difficult to detect unless and until the investment vehicles ultimately collapse.

Typically, however, if a Ponzi scheme is not stopped by authorities it usually falls apart for one or more of the following reasons:
# The operator vanishes, taking all the remaining investment money. Promoters who intend to abscond often attempt to do so as returns due to be paid are about to exceed new investments, as this is when the investment capital available will be at its maximum.
# Since the scheme requires a continual stream of investments to fund higher returns, if the number of new investors slows down, the scheme collapses as the operator can no longer pay the promised returns (the higher the returns, the greater the risk of the Ponzi scheme collapsing). Such liquidity crises often trigger panics, as more people start asking for their money, similar to a bank run.
# External market forces, such as a sharp decline in the economy, can often hasten the collapse of a Ponzi scheme (for example, the Madoff investment scandal during the market downturn of 2008), since they often cause many investors to attempt to withdraw part or all of their funds sooner than they had intended.

In some cases, two or more of the aforementioned factors may be at play. For example, news of a police investigation into a Ponzi scheme may cause investors to immediately demand their money, and in turn cause the promoters to flee the jurisdiction sooner than planned (assuming they intended to eventually abscond in the first place), thus causing the scheme to collapse much faster than if the police investigation had simply been permitted to run its course.

=== Pyramid scheme ===
A pyramid scheme is a form of fraud similar in some ways to a Ponzi scheme, relying as it does on a mistaken belief in a nonexistent financial reality, including the hope of an extremely high rate of return. However, several characteristics distinguish these schemes from Ponzi schemes:
* In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a &quot;hub&quot; for the victims, interacting with all of them directly. In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly. Failure to recruit typically means no investment return.
* A Ponzi scheme claims to rely on some esoteric investment approach, and often attracts well-to-do investors, whereas pyramid schemes explicitly claim that new money will be the source of payout for the initial investments.
* A pyramid scheme typically collapses much faster because it requires exponential increases in participants to sustain it. By contrast, Ponzi schemes can survive (at least in the short-term) simply by persuading most existing participants to reinvest their money, with a relatively small number of new participants.

=== Cryptocurrency Ponzi ===
Cryptocurrencies have been employed by scammers attempting a new generation of Ponzi schemes. For example, misuse of initial coin offerings, or &quot;ICOs&quot;, has been one such method, known as &quot;smart Ponzis&quot; per the &quot;Financial Times&quot;. Most schemes have a low recovery rate with investors losing their funds permanently. 

The novelty of ICOs means that there is currently a lack of regulatory clarity on the classification of these financial devices, allowing scammers wide leeway to develop Ponzi schemes using these pseudo-assets. Also, the pseudonymity of cryptocurrency transactions and their international nature involving countless jurisdictions in many different countries can make it much more difficult to identify and take legal action (whether civil or criminal) against perpetrators.

The May 2022 collapse of TerraUSD, a stablecoin propped up by a complex algorithmic mechanism offering 20% yields, was described as &quot;Ponzinomics&quot; by &quot;Wired&quot;. Another example of a well known Ponzi scheme involving cryptoassets was the ICO of &quot;AriseBank&quot; or &quot;AriseCoin&quot;, involving claims about founding the world&#x27;s first &quot;decentralized bank&quot;. The SEC successfully recovered the funds stolen in the ICO. A similar scheme was perpetrated by the founders of the fraudulent cryptocurrency Bitconnect.

In September 2022, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, described cryptocurrencies as &quot;Decentralised Ponzi Schemes&quot;.

=== Economic bubble ===
Economic bubbles are also similar to a Ponzi scheme in that one participant gets paid by contributions from a subsequent participant until inevitable collapse. A bubble involves ever-rising prices in an open market (for example stock, housing, cryptocurrency, tulip bulbs in the case of the first, or the Mississippi Company) where prices rise because buyers bid more, and buyers bid more because prices are rising. Bubbles are often said to be based on the &quot;greater fool&quot; theory. As with the Ponzi scheme, the price exceeds the intrinsic value of the item, but unlike the Ponzi scheme:
* In most economic bubbles, there is no single person or group misrepresenting the intrinsic value. A common exception is a pump and dump scheme (typically involving buyers and holders of thinly-traded stocks), which much more closely resembles a Ponzi scheme than other types of bubbles.
* Ponzi schemes typically result in criminal charges when authorities discover them but, other than pump and dump schemes, economic bubbles do not typically involve unlawful activity, or even bad faith on the part of any participant. Laws are only broken if someone perpetuates the bubble by knowingly and deliberately misrepresenting facts to inflate the value of an item (as with a pump and dump scheme). Even when this occurs, wrongdoing (and especially criminal activity) is often much more difficult to prove in court compared to a Ponzi scheme. Therefore, the collapse of an economic bubble rarely results in criminal charges (which require proof beyond a reasonable doubt to secure a conviction) and, even when charges are pursued, they are often against corporations, which can be easier to pursue in court compared to charges against people but also can only result in fines as opposed to jail time. The more commonly-pursued legal recourse in situations where someone suspects an economic bubble is the result of nefarious activity is to sue for damages in civil court, where the standard of proof is only balance of probabilities and where the plaintiff need not demonstrate &quot;mens rea&quot;.
* In some jurisdictions, following the collapse of a Ponzi scheme, even the &quot;innocent&quot; beneficiaries are liable to repay any gains for distribution to the victims. In this context, &quot;innocent&quot; beneficiaries can include anyone who unwittingly profited without being aware of the fraudulent nature of the scheme, and even charities to which perpetrators often give to relatively generously while a scheme is in operation in an effort to enhance their own profile and thereby &quot;profit&quot; from the resulting positive media coverage. This typically does not happen in the case of an economic bubble, especially if nobody can prove the bubble was caused by anyone acting in bad faith, moreover a person whose own participation in an economic bubble is not particularly notable is not likely to enhance participation in the bubble and thus personally profit by donating to charity.
* Items traded in an economic bubble are much more likely to have an intrinsic value that is worth a substantial proportion of the market price. Therefore, following collapse of an economic bubble (especially one in a commodity such as real estate) the items affected will often retain some value, whereas an investment that is part of a Ponzi scheme will typically be worthless (or very close to worthless). On the other hand, it is much easier to obtain financing for many items that are the frequent subject of bubbles. If an investor trading on margin or borrowing to finance investments becomes the victim of a bubble, he or she can still lose all (or a very substantial portion) of his or her investment capital, or even be liable for losses in excess of the original capital investment.

=== Exit scam ===
A Ponzi scheme which ultimately terminates with the operator absconding is similar to an exit scam. The main difference is that an exit scam does not involve any sort of investment vehicle with the accompanying promised returns. Instead, exit scammers either accept payment for product which they never ship (usually after gaining a reputation for reliably shipping of products) or steal funds held in escrow on behalf of third parties (the latter often involves the operators of illegal darknet markets that facilitate the sale of illicit goods and services).

== Related concepts ==
=== Ponzi finance ===
The term &quot;Ponzi finance&quot; generally designates non-sustainable patterns of finance, such as borrowers who can only meet their debt commitment if they continuously obtain new sources of financing, often at an accelerating pace and/or ever-increasing interest rates until the borrower cannot secure more financing at any interest rate and becomes insolvent. The term was first coined by economist Hyman Minsky.

=== Ponzi game ===
In economics, the term &quot;Ponzi game&quot; designates a hypothesis where a government continuously defers the repayment of its public debt by issuing new debt: each time its existing debt arrives at maturity, it borrows funds from new and/or existing lenders in order to repay its existing debt.

<doc id="47188" wikidata="Q496389" url="?curid=47188" title="Lipari">
<text>Lipari (; ) is a &quot;comune&quot; including six of seven islands of the Aeolian Islands (Lipari, Vulcano, Panarea, Stromboli, Filicudi and Alicudi) and it is located in the Tyrrhenian Sea off the northern coast of Sicily, Southern Italy; it is administratively part of the Metropolitan City of Messina. Its population is 12,821, but during the May to September tourist season, the total population may reach up to 20,000. It is also the name of the biggest island in the archipelago, where the main urban area of the &quot;comune&quot; is located.

==Geography==

Lipari Island is the largest of a chain of islands in a volcanic archipelago situated in between Vesuvius and Etna. The island has a surface area of 89.72 km2 and is 30 km from Sicily. Besides the main town, most of the year-round population resides in one of the four main villages: Pianoconte is almost due west across the island, Quattropani in the northwest, Acquacalda along the northern coast, whereas Canneto is on the eastern shore north of Lipari town. The highest point on the island is Monte Chirica at 602 m (1975 ft).

==Geology==
Geologists agree on the fact that Lipari (island) was created by a succession of four volcanic movements, the most extensive of which was the third one, presumably lasting from 20,000 BC to 13,000 BC. A further vast phenomenon should have happened around 9000 BC. The last recorded eruptions occurred in the 5th century AD when airborne pumice, together with volcanic ash, covered the Roman villages of the island. The volcanoes are considered active, and steaming fumaroles and hydrothermal activity may still be seen. As a result of its volcanic origin, the island is covered with pumice and obsidian. Pumice mining has become a large industry on Lipari, and the pale pumice from Lipari is shipped worldwide.

==History==

===Neolithic period===

In Neolithic times Lipari was, much like Sardinia, one of the few centres of trading in obsidian, a hard black volcanic glass prized by Neolithic peoples for the extremely sharp cutting edges that can be obtained. Lipari&#x27;s history is rich in incidents as witnessed by the recent retrievals of several necropoli and other archaeological sites. Humans seem to have inhabited the island already in 5000 BC, though a local legend gives the eponymous name Liparus to the leader of a people coming from Campania.

===Bronze Age===
====Early Bronze Age====
In the early Bronze Age, at the end of the third millennium BC, new settlers of Aeolian origin came from Mycenaean Greece, giving their name to the islands. They had already settled in Metapontum in Italy and used the islands as outposts for controlling trading routes through the strait of Messina.

====Middle Bronze Age====
Successive domestic buildings have been excavated on the acropolis dating from the 18th c. BC and underlying the ancient Roman town.

====Late Bronze Age====
In the 13th century BC, the islands were settled by Ausinian peoples from the coasts of Campania, who introduced the myth of King Liparus from whom the town’s name derives.

In the Mycenaean Period, Lipari has yielded pottery from LHI to LHIII.

===Iron Age===

Lipari&#x27;s continuous occupation may have been interrupted violently when in the late 9th century BC an Ausonian civilization site was burned and apparently not rebuilt. Many household objects have been retrieved from the charred site.

===Greek and Roman periods===

Greek colonists from Knidos arrived at Lipara ~580 BC after their first colonization attempt in Sicily failed and their leader, Pentathlos, was killed. They settled on the site of the village now known as Castello in Magna Graecia. The colony successfully fought the Etruscans for control of the Tyrrhenian Sea.

The town was initially concentrated upon the summit of the rock which played the role of acropolis, seat of religious cults and of public life, but in the course of the first century of its existence, an increase in the population necessitated an expansion into the area at the foot of the rocky slopes and on to the top of the Civita hill. A first city wall, built sometime in the 5th century BC was erected along outcrops at the bottom of the slopes of the rock, leaving outside the modern district of Diana, which was destined from the beginning to accommodate the city necropolis. A second city wall was built in the 4th century BC to enclose the new residential area bounded to the north and south by the river-beds of Santa Lucia and Ponte, which in ancient times ran into the two bays at the foot of the rock. The city wall ran near the two river-beds and then joined on to the Acropolis and the Civita hill. The mighty fortification, of which some traces are visible today in the district of Diana, divided the town from the necropolis.

Carthaginian forces succeeded in holding the site briefly during their struggles with Dionysios I, tyrant of Syracuse in 394 BC, but once they were gone the &quot;polis&quot; entered a three-way alliance which included Dionysios&#x27; new colony at Tyndaris. Lipara prospered, but in 304 BC Agathokles took the town by treachery and is said to have lost all of his pillage from it in a storm at sea.

Lipara became a Carthaginian naval base during the first Punic War, but fell to Roman forces in 252–251 BC. It was occupied by Agrippa in Octavian&#x27;s campaign against Sextus Pompeius. Under the Roman Empire it was a place of retreat and exile and was enjoyed because of its thermal baths using natural springs. The Emperor Caracalla sent his wife, Fulvia Plautilla, and her brother, Plautius, into exile here for the rest of their lives.

Many objects recovered from old wrecks are now in the Aeolian Museum of Lipari.

===From the Middle Ages to present===

Lipari was probably an episcopal see from the 3rd century onward, with the first bishop being St. Agatone, who, according to tradition, had found the sacred remains in his cathedral. The presence of the relics has been attested since at least 546.

In the 9th century, Sicily was conquered by the Arabs, and soon Saracen pirates began to raid across the Tyrrhenian Sea, with dramatic effects for Lipari. In 839 the Saracens slaughtered much of the population, the relics of St. Bartholomew were moved to Benevento, and Lipari was eventually almost totally abandoned. The Normans conquered the Arabs throughout Sicily between 1060 and 1090, and repopulated the island once their rule was secure. The Lipari episcopal seat was reinstated in 1131.

Though still plagued by pirate raids, the island was continually populated from this time onward. Rule of the island was passed from the Normans to the Hohenstaufen Kings, followed by the Angevins, and then the Aragonese, until Carlos I, the Aragonese King, became the Spanish King, and was then quickly crowned Holy Roman Emperor Charles V.

====Franco-Ottoman attack====
In 1544, Hayreddin Barbarossa, together with the French fleet of Captain Polin under a Franco-Ottoman alliance, ransacked Lipari and enslaved the entire population. Jérôme Maurand lamented about the depredation to his Christian fellow men during the campaign at Lipari: &quot;To see so many poor Christians, and especially so many little boys and girls [enslaved] caused a very great pity.&quot; He also mentioned &quot;the tears, wailings and cries of these poor Lipariotes, the father regarding his son and the mother her daughter... weeping while leaving their own city in order to be brought into slavery by those dogs who seemed like rapacious wolves amidst timid lambs&quot;.

A number of the citizens were ransomed in Messina and eventually returned to the islands.

Charles V then had his Spanish subjects repopulate the island and build the massive city walls atop the walls of the ancient Greek acropolis in 1556.

The walls created a mighty fortress still standing today. The acropolis, high above the main town, was a safe haven for the populace in the event of a raid. While these walls protected the main town, it was not safe to live on the rest of the island until Mediterranean piracy was largely eradicated, which did not occur until the 19th century.

===20th century===

From the 1920s to the 1940s, the Lipari islands were used for the confinement of political prisoners, including Emilio Lussu, Curzio Malaparte, Carlo Rosselli, Giuseppe Ghetti, and Edda Mussolini. During the 1930s, the islands were used to detain exiled members of the fascist, Croatian nationalist Ustaše movement.

They islands were then extensively searched by archeologists Madeleine Cavalier and Luigi Bernabò Brea after World War II.

==Culture and media==
* The large archaeological museum extensively covers history of the Aeolian Islands from prehistoric to classical times, vulcanology, marine history, and the paleontology of the western Mediterranean.
* The geographer Strabo identified Lipari with Aeolia, the island of the winds in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;.
* The ending sequence of &quot;Kaos&quot; by Paolo and Vittorio Taviani showed children sliding down the vast slopes of white pumice that flowed into the sea. Today the pumice slope stops about from the sea.
* The annual Feasts of Saint Bartholomew.
* On 25 July 2013, the mayor of Lipari issued an ordinance banning the wearing of &quot;bikinis, thongs or other swimming costumes in the town centre&quot; to be punished with a fine of 500 euros (equivalent to about $700 in 2014).

<text>Tindari (; ), ancient Tyndaris (, Strab.) or Tyndarion (, Ptol.), is a small town, &quot;frazione&quot; (suburb or municipal component) in the &quot;comune&quot; of Patti and a Latin Catholic titular see.

The monumental ruins of ancient Tyndaris are a main attraction for visitors and excavations are continuing to reveal more parts of the city.

Tindari has a famous sanctuary and is also famous for the poem &quot;Vento a Tindari&quot;, written by Salvatore Quasimodo.

== History ==

Ancient Tyndaris was strategically situated on its prominent hill overlooking the wide bay of the Tyrrhenian Sea bounded by the Capo di Milazzo on the east, and the Capo Calavà on the west. It was connected by a comparatively narrow isthmus with the lower ground inland. It thus commanded views of the summit of Mount Etna and northwards to the Lipari Islands.

It was one of the latest of all the cities in Sicily that could claim a purely Greek origin, having been founded by the elder Dionysius in 396 or 395 BC in Magna Graecia; the site is so strategic that it is a surprise it was not occupied earlier. The original settlers were the remains of the Messenian exiles, who had been driven from Naupactus, Zacynthus, and the Peloponnese by the Spartans after the close of the Peloponnesian War. These had at first been established by Dionysius at Messana, when he repeopled that city; but the Spartans having taken umbrage at this, he transferred them to the site of Tyndaris, which had previously been included in the territory of Abacaenum. The colonists themselves gave to their new city the name of Tyndaris, from their native divinities, the &quot;Tyndaridae&quot; or Dioscuri, and readily admitting fresh citizens from other quarters, soon raised their whole population to the number of 5000 citizens. The new city thus rose at once to be a place of considerable importance.

It is next mentioned in 344 BC, when it was one of the first cities that declared in favor of Timoleon after his landing in Sicily. At a later period we find it mentioned as espousing the cause of Hieron, and supporting him during his war against the Mamertines, 269 BC. On that occasion he rested his position upon Tyndaris on the left, and on Tauromenium (modern Taormina) on the right. Indeed, the strong position of Tyndaris made it an important strategic post on the Tyrrhenian sea, as Tauromenium was on the Sicilian sea, and hence we find it frequently mentioned in accounts of subsequent wars. In the First Punic War it was at first dependent upon Carthage; and though the citizens, alarmed at the progress of the Roman armies, were at one time on the point of turning to Rome, they were restrained by the Carthaginians, who carried off all the chief citizens as hostages. In 257 BC, the Battle of Tyndaris took place off the coast of Tyndaris, between the city and the Liparaean islands, in which a Roman fleet under Gaius Atilius Regulus obtained some advantage over the Carthaginian fleet, but without any decisive result. The Roman fleet is described on that occasion as touching at the promontory of Tyndaris, but the city had not yet fallen into their hands, and it was not until after the fall of Panormus (modern Palermo) in 254 BC that Tyndaris expelled the Carthaginian garrison and joined the Roman alliance.

We hear little of Tyndaris under Roman government, but it appears to have been a flourishing and considerable city. Cicero calls it &quot;nobilissima civitas&quot; and we learn from him that the inhabitants had displayed their zeal and fidelity towards the Romans upon many occasions. Among others they supplied naval forces for the armament of Scipio Africanus the Younger, a service for which he repaid them by restoring to them a statue of Mercury which had been carried off by the Carthaginians and which continued as an object of great veneration in the city, until it was stolen by the rapacious Verres. Tyndaris was also one of seventeen cities selected by the Roman senate, apparently as an honorary distinction, to contribute to certain offerings to the temple of Venus at Eryx. In other respects it had no peculiar privileges, and was in the condition of an ordinary municipal town, with its own magistrates, local senate, etc., but was certainly in the time of Cicero one of the most considerable places in the island. It, however, suffered severely from the exactions of Verres and the inhabitants, to revenge themselves on their oppressor, publicly demolished his statue as soon as he had quit the island.

Tyndaris again bore a considerable part in the Sicilian revolt between Sextus Pompeius and Octavian. It was one of the points occupied and fortified by the former, when preparing for the defence of the Sicilian straits, but was taken by Agrippa after his naval victory at Mylae, and became one of his chief posts, from which he carried on offensive warfare against Pompey. Subsequently, to this we hear nothing more of Tyndaris in history; but there is no doubt of its having continued to subsist throughout the period of the Roman Empire. Strabo speaks of it as one of the places on the north coast of Sicily which, in his time, still deserved the name of cities; and Pliny gives it the title of a &quot;Colonia&quot;. It is probable that it received a colony under Augustus, as we find it bearing in an inscription the titles of &quot;Colonia Augusta Tyndaritanorum&quot;. Pliny indeed mentions a great calamity which the city had sustained, when (he tells us) half of it was swallowed up by the sea, probably from an earthquake having caused the fall of part of the hill on which it stands, but we have no clue to the date of this event. The Itineraries attest the existence of Tyndaris, apparently still as a considerable place, in the fourth century.

== Ecclesiastical history ==

* Established in 498 as Diocese of Tindari (Italian) / Tyndaris (Latin) / Tyndaritan(us) (Latin adjective). In the early 7th century Sicily had no Metropolitan see, so although politically part of the Byzantine empire, all its bishoprics were in the sway of the papal (&#x27;Western&#x27;) Patriarchate of Rome as (exempt) suffragan dioceses of Rome. During the conflict on Iconoclasm, Byzantine emperor Leo III the Isaurian transferred all Sicily to his capital&#x27;s Patriarchate of Constantinople (circa 732); in the 8th or 9th century, the newly created Metropolitan Archdiocese of Syracuse was given all Sicilian bishoprics as suffragans, including Tindari, where no bishops were recorded since 649.
* Although the Notitia Episcopatuum under emperor Leo VI (early 10th century) still lists Tindari among the suffragans of Syracuse, that probably was just canonical theory, as in 836 Tindari was conquered for Islam by Arabs and nothing is heard from the diocese.
* Formally suppressed in 880 without direct successor, but lost (some) territory in 1082 to establish the short-lived Diocese of Troina (suppressed in 1098 to establish the Diocese of Messina). When Sicilia was again conquered and Christianize by the Normans in the 11th century, the bishopric wasn&#x27;t restored, its territory rather assigned to the new Diocese of Patti.

=== Titular see ===
The diocese was nominally restored in 1968 as Latin Titular bishopric of Tindari (Curiate Italian) / Tyndaris (Latin) / Tyndaritan(us) (Latin adjective)

== Remains ==
By the 19th century, the site of Tyndaris was wholly deserted, but the name was retained by a church, which crowned the most elevated point of the hill on which the city formerly stood, and was still called the Madonna di Tindaro. It is c. 180 m above the sea-level, and forms a conspicuous landmark to sailors. Considerable ruins of the ancient city, are also visible. It occupied the whole plateau or summit of the hill, and the remains of the ancient walls may be traced, at intervals, all round the brow of the cliffs, except in one part, facing the sea, where the cliff is now quite precipitous. It is not improbable that it is here that a part of the cliff fell in, in the manner recorded by Pliny Two gates of the city are also still distinctly to be traced.

The chief monuments, of which the ruins are still extant within the circuit of the walls, are:
* the theatre, of which the remains are in imperfect condition, but sufficient to show that it was not of large size, and apparently of Roman construction, or at least, like that of Tauromenium, rebuilt in Roman times upon the Greek foundations
* a propylaeum with two handsome stone arches (previously called a Gymnasium)
* several other edifices of Roman times, but of wholly uncertain character, a mosaic pavement and some Roman tombs. 
Numerous inscriptions, fragments of sculpture, and architectural decorations, as well as coins, vases etc. have also been discovered on the site.


== Legend ==
Local legend tells that the lagoon was created after a pilgrim who came to see the Madonna refused to pray to the Madonna because she was black. The woman accidentally dropped her baby into the ocean and the Madonna made the land rise to save the baby. The sands of Marinello have taken shape of the profile of the Madonna.

== Cultural references ==
An episode of &quot;Inspector Montalbano&quot; was called &quot;Excursion to Tindari&quot;. It ends with four of the main characters overlooking the bay.
Salvatore Quasimodo, who would later win the Nobel prize for literature, in 1930 published a poem entitled &quot;Vento a Tindari&quot; (Wind at Tindari).

==Accessibility==
By car, if you come from Falcone , of Autostrada Messina-Palermo take Palermo direction along SS 113.

But Tindari and its Church are reachable by trains run by Trenitalia, including services from Messina with the Oliveri railway station situated on the Palermo–Messina railway. Outside of the station is available an Uber service by app.

Tindari is also served by bus provided from Azienda Siciliana Trasporti.

<text>Tallangatta () is a town in north-eastern Victoria, Australia. The town lies on the banks of the Mitta Arm of Lake Hume, approximately south-east of Albury-Wodonga along the Murray Valley Highway. At the , Tallangatta had a population of 1,175.

==History==
Tallangatta was founded in the 1870s, the Post Office opening on 15 May 1871.

On the arrival of the railway it served as a rail gateway for the Mitta and Upper Murray valleys (the Upper Murray only until the railway was extended to Cudgewa). Some gold and tin mining occurred in the late 19th and early 20th century, though, unlike Beechworth, little evidence of this remains. The amount of gold produced was relatively small compared to other mines elsewhere in the region.

Since that time, Tallangatta has been a service centre for the local farming community, with a butter factory operating throughout much of the 20th century. Improved road transport links finally ended both the dairy and the rail link in the 1970s (with dairy processing operations now concentrated in Tangambalanga, about to the west).

The most distinctive aspect of the town&#x27;s history is that it was moved to the west in the 1950s to a site known as Bolga to allow for the expansion of Lake Hume. Stories of the transition from old town to new town were captured in the 1988 book &quot;Slates and Suet Puddings&quot; by Carmyl Winkler. On 14 April 1955 the Post Office was renamed Tallangatta East and a new Tallangatta office opened at the new town location. The sign welcoming motorists to town reads &quot;Tallangatta, the town that moved in the 1950s&quot;.

The grid layout of the streets of Old Tallangatta is clearly visible in Google Earth.

The Tallangatta Magistrates&#x27; Court closed on 1 January 1990.

== Climate ==
Tallangatta possesses a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cfa), with very warm, relatively dry summers and cool, slightly wetter winters. Average maxima vary from in January to in July while average minima fluctuate between in January and in July. Mean precipitation is moderate (averaging per annum). Tallangatta receives 111.6 precipitation days annually, with its frequency peaking in winter. The town experiences 111.4 clear days and 145.1 cloudy days per annum. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 31 January 2020 to on 26 July 1986. All climate data was sourced from Hume Dam, situated northwest of Tallangatta.

==Population==
According to the 2021 Census the population of Tallangatta is 1,175, of which:

* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 1.9% of the population
* 82.8% of people were born in Australia. 3.2% of the population were born in England, 0.9% in Malaysia, 0.7% in the United States of America, 0.6% in Scotland and 0.5% in Samoa.
* 89.7% of people spoke only English at home, with the next most common language being Samoan, spoken by 1.0% of the population.
* The most common responses for religion were No Religion 40.1%, Anglican 18.2% Catholic 14.4%, and Uniting Church 5.4%.

==Economy==
Beef and dairy cattle farming is the dominant industry, with a small abattoir. In 2016, Tallangatta was declared a &quot;Notable Town&quot;, by Heritage Australia. The main street is long for a town of its size and is quite unique. The unique architecture is home to a thriving retail and hospitality sector that contributes to local employment and tourism. Services include a small hospital, and two primary schools, a secondary school and an integrated childcare, library and community centre. A considerable number of residents now commute to work in Albury–Wodonga.

The decline of the water frontage of Lake Hume, due to sporadic drought conditions and the privatisation of Australia waterways, has had an impact on the town. Although through initiatives, such as the Tallangatta Tomorrow project funded by state government, the township is experiencing a new lease on life.

Several community-focused initiatives operate within the township including Tallangatta Food Swap, Boomerang Bags Tallangatta, the Tallangatta Community Theatre Group, the Uniting Church Op Shop, and Plasticwise Tallangatta.

The town has a high proportion of retirees, with some elderly people cared for at Bolga Court Hostel. This heritage is celebrated in the popular annual Tallangatta Fifties Festival; however, as of June 2018, has ended due to financial concerns and feedback.

==Transport==

There is no scheduled public transport in Tallangatta, other than school buses which are not available to the general public. The town is mainly accessed via the Murray Valley Highway; the northern terminus of the Omeo Highway to Omeo is approximately east of the town. 

The High Country Rail Trail passes through the town; it follows the route of the Cudgewa railway line, which closed in 1981.

==Sport==
Tallangatta has an Australian rules football team, the Tallangatta Football Club competing in the Tallangatta &amp; District Football League.

Golfers play at the Tallangatta Golf Club on Coorilla Street.

==Notable residents==
* Phillip Law, scientist and Antarctic explorer was born in Tallangatta in 1912
* Doug Smith, North Melbourne footballer grew up in Tallangatta
* William Yates, a politician who served in both the British and Australian parliaments, spent his last years in Tallangatta
* Ian Trevaskis, writer and author; Children&#x27;s Book Council of Australia award-winning author

<doc id="47198" wikidata="Q3955" url="?curid=47198" title="Weimar">
<text>Weimar is a city in the German state of Thuringia, in Central Germany between Erfurt to the west and Jena to the east, southwest of Leipzig, north of Nuremberg and west of Dresden. Together with the neighbouring cities of Erfurt and Jena, it forms the central metropolitan area of Thuringia, with approximately 500,000 inhabitants. The city itself has a population of 65,000. Weimar is well known because of its cultural heritage and importance in German history.

The city was a focal point of the German Enlightenment and home of the leading literary figures of Weimar Classicism, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller. In the 19th century, composers such as Franz Liszt made Weimar a music centre. Later, artists and architects such as Henry van de Velde, Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Lyonel Feininger, and Walter Gropius came to the city and founded the Bauhaus movement, the most important German design school of the interwar period.

The political history of 20th-century Weimar was volatile: it was the place where Germany&#x27;s first democratic constitution was signed after the First World War, giving its name to the Weimar Republic (1918–33). It was also one of the cities mythologized by Nazi propaganda.

Until 1948, Weimar was the capital of Thuringia. Many places in the city centre have been designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, either as part of the Classical Weimar complex (containing monuments to the classical period of Weimar in 18th and 19th centuries) or the Bauhaus complex (containing buildings associated with the Bauhaus art school). Heritage tourism is one of the leading economic sectors of Weimar.

Noted institutions in Weimar are the Bauhaus University, the Liszt School of Music, the Duchess Anna Amalia Library, and two leading courts of Thuringia (the Supreme Administrative Court and Constitutional Court). In 1999, Weimar was the European Capital of Culture.

==History==
=== Prehistoric times ===
Archaeological finds dating back to the Thuringii epoch (3rd to 6th centuries) show that the Weimar part of the Ilm valley was settled early. A tight network of settlements occupied much of the area of today&#x27;s city.

=== Middle Ages ===

The oldest records regarding Weimar date to 899. Its name changed over the centuries from &quot;Wimares&quot; through &quot;Wimari&quot; to &quot;Wimar&quot; and finally Weimar; it is derived from Old High German &quot;wīh-&quot; (holy) and &quot;-mari&quot; (standing water, swamp). The place was the seat of the County of Weimar, first mentioned in 949, which was one of the most powerful jurisdictions in early Middle Ages Thuringia. In 1062 it was united with the County of Orlamünde into the new County of Weimar-Orlamünde, which existed until the Thuringian Counts&#x27; War in 1346. It fell to the Wettins afterwards.

The Weimar settlement emerged around the count&#x27;s wooden castle and two small churches, dedicated to Saint Peter (which later became the main church), and to Saint James, respectively. In 1240, the count founded the dynasty&#x27;s monastery in Oberweimar, run by Cistercian nuns. Soon after, the counts of Weimar founded the town, which was an independent parish since 1249 and called &quot;civitas&quot; in 1254. From 1262, the citizens used their own seal. The regional influence of the Weimar counts was declining as the influence of the Wettins in Thuringia increased. Hence, the new small town was relatively marginal in a regional context, also due to the fact that it was located far from relevant trade routes, such as the Via Regia. The settlement around Saint James Church developed into a suburb during the 13th century.

After becoming part of Wettin territory in 1346, urban development improved. The Wettins fostered Weimar by abolishing socage and granting privileges to the citizens. Now Weimar became equal to other Wettinian cities like Weißensee and grew during the 15th century, with the establishment of a town hall and the current main church. In 1438 Weimar acquired trade privileges for woad, a plant from which blue dye was made. The castle and the walls were finished in the 16th century, making Weimar into a full city.

=== Early Modern Period ===

After the Treaty of Leipzig (1485) Weimar became part of the electorate of the Ernestine branch of Wettins with Wittenberg as capital. The Protestant Reformation was introduced in Weimar in 1525; Martin Luther stayed several times in the city. As the Ernestines lost the Schmalkaldic War in 1547, their capital Wittenberg went also to the Albertines, so that they needed a new residence. As the ruler returned from captivity, Weimar became his residence in 1552 and remained as such until the end of the monarchy in 1918. The first Ernestine territorial partition in 1572 was followed by various ones, nevertheless Weimar stayed the capital of different Saxe-Weimar states. The court and its staff brought some wealth to the city, so that it saw a first construction boom in the 16th century. The 17th century brought decline to Weimar, because of changing trade conditions (as in nearby Erfurt). Besides, the territorial partitions led to the loss of political importance of the dukes of Saxe-Weimar and their finances shrunk. The city&#x27;s polity weakened more and more and lost its privileges, leading to the absolutist reign of the dukes in the early 18th century. On the other hand, this time brought another construction boom to Weimar, and the city got its present appearance, marked by various ducal representation buildings. The city walls were demolished in 1757 and during the following decades, Weimar expanded in all directions. The biggest building constructed in this period was the &quot;Schloss&quot; as the residence of the dukes (north and east wing: 1789–1803, west wing 1832–1835, south wing: 1913–1914). Between 1708 and 1717 Johann Sebastian Bach worked as the court&#x27;s organist in Weimar.

=== Silver Ages and The New Weimar (1832–1918) ===
The time after Goethe&#x27;s death is denoted as the &quot;silver&quot; age because Weimar remained an influential cultural centre. The first emphasis was fostering music. In 1842, Franz Liszt moved to Weimar to become the Grand Ducal court conductor. Liszt organized the premiere of Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot; (1850) as well as the world première of Saint Saëns&#x27; opera Samson et Delilah (1877) in the city. The Weimar School of Music was founded in 1872 as Germany&#x27;s first orchestra school. Richard Strauss worked in Weimar between 1889 and 1894 as second conductor in the acclaimed Staatskapelle Weimar (the court orchestra founded in 1491). Several of his encores for works such as &quot;Don Juan&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot; were performed by the Staatskapelle Weimar. He also premièred Humperdinck&#x27;s opera Hänsel and Gretel 1893 in Weimar. Friedrich Nietzsche moved to Weimar in 1897, and died there three years later.

In 1860 the Weimar Saxon-Grand Ducal Art School, the precursor of today&#x27;s Bauhaus University, was founded. This was the beginning of academic arts education in Weimar. The institution created its own painting style, the &quot;Weimar School&quot; of painting with representatives such as Max Liebermann and Arnold Böcklin. The Kunstgewerbeschule Weimar was found by Henry van de Velde with the support of Grand Duke William Ernest in 1902 and represents the other root of Bauhaus, known as &quot;Das Neue Weimar&quot; (&quot;The New Weimar&quot;) around Harry Graf Kessler. It was a foundation against Prussia&#x27;s restrictive arts policy favouring Historicism instead of international Arts and Crafts and Art Nouveau.

As early as the 19th century, the curation of Weimar and its heritage started. Many archives, societies and museums were founded to present and conserve the cultural sights and goods. In 1846, Weimar was connected by the Thuringian Railway. In the following decades, the city saw a construction and population boom (like most late-19th century cities in Germany). Nevertheless, Weimar did not become industrialised, and remained a city of clerks, artists and rentiers. During the German Revolution of 1918–19 the last reigning grand duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, William Ernest, had to abdicate and went in exile to Heinrichau in Silesia.

=== Weimar Republic ===
The period in German history from 1919 to 1933 is commonly referred to as the Weimar Republic, as the Republic&#x27;s constitution was drafted there rather than Berlin. The capital was considered too dangerous for the National Assembly to use as a meeting place because of street rioting during the Spartacist uprising. Reich President Friedrich Ebert favored Weimar because he hoped it would remind the victorious Allies of Weimar Classicism while they were deliberating the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. Since the calm and centrally located Weimar had a suitable place of assembly (the theatre), hotels and infrastructure, it was chosen as the host city.

In 1920, the federal state of Thuringia was founded by an association of eight former microstates (Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Saxe-Gotha, Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Meiningen, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, Reuss-Gera and Reuss-Greiz) and Weimar became its capital. Due to that fact, the city experienced another period of growth.

In 1919, Walter Gropius founded the Bauhaus School by a merger of the Weimar Saxon-Grand Ducal Art School with the Kunstgewerbeschule Weimar. The Bauhaus in Weimar lasted from 1919 to 1925, when it moved to Dessau, after the newly elected right-wing Thuringian council put pressure on the school by withdrawing funding and forcing its teachers to quit. Many buildings in Weimar today have influences from the Bauhaus period. However, only one original Bauhaus building was constructed during 1919–1925, the Haus am Horn, now used for exhibitions and events on Bauhaus culture.

The Weimar Republic era was marked by a constant conflict between progressive and &quot;Völkisch&quot; forces, the former represented by Harry Graf Kessler and the latter by Adolf Bartels in Weimar. The &quot;Weimarer Zeitung&quot; was published in Weimar as a local newspaper. After 1929, the right-wing forces prevailed and Weimar became an early centre of Nazism.

=== Nazi Germany and World War II ===

Weimar was important to the Nazis for two reasons: first, it was where the hated Weimar Republic was founded, and second, it had been a centre of German high culture in recent centuries. In 1926, the NSDAP held its party convention in Weimar. Adolf Hitler visited Weimar more than forty times prior to 1933. In 1930, Wilhelm Frick became minister for internal affairs and education in Thuringia the first NSDAP minister in Germany. In 1932, the NSDAP came to power in Thuringia under Fritz Sauckel. In 1933, the first Nazi concentration camps were established around Weimar in Nohra (the first one in Germany) and Bad Sulza. Most prisoners at this time were communists and social democrats. After Kristallnacht in 1938, harassment of Jews became more intense, so that many of them emigrated or were arrested. The Weimar Synagogue was destroyed in 1938.

During the 1930s, the barracks in Weimar was greatly extended. One famous person serving as a soldier in Weimar was Wolfgang Borchert, later a well known poet and playwright. As it was the capital of Thuringia, the Nazis built a new Roman-fascist-style administrative centre between the city centre and the main station. This , designed by Hermann Giesler, was the only Nazi governmental building completed outside Berlin (though there were plans for all German state capitals). Today it hosts the Thuringian State Administration. Other Giesler buildings are the , the governor&#x27;s palace and the in the city centre.

In 1937, the Nazis established Buchenwald concentration camp from Weimar city centre. Between July 1938 and April 1945, some 240,000 people were incarcerated in the camp by the Nazi regime, including 168 Western Allied POWs. The number of deaths in Buchenwald is estimated at 56,545. The Buchenwald concentration camp provided slave labour for local industry, including the &quot;Wilhelm-Gustloff-Werk&quot; arms factory.

The city centre was partially damaged by US Air Force bombing in 1945 with some 1,800 people killed and many historic buildings destroyed. Nevertheless, most of the destroyed buildings were restored soon after the war because of their importance in German cultural history. The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Weimar in April 1945, and the city surrendered to the US 80th Infantry Division on 12 April 1945. The residents of Weimar were ordered to walk through Buchenwald, to see what had been happening so close to the city, as documented in Billy Wilder&#x27;s film &quot;Death Mills&quot;. The city ended up in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, so US troops were soon replaced by Soviet forces.

=== Since 1945 ===
From 1945 to 1950, the Soviet Union used the occupied Buchenwald concentration camp as a NKVD special camp to imprison defeated Nazis and other Germans. The camp slogan remained . On 6 January 1950, the Soviets handed over Buchenwald to the East German Ministry of Internal Affairs.

In 1948, the East German government declared Erfurt as Thuringia&#x27;s new capital, and Weimar lost its influence on German contemporary culture and politics. (The state of Thuringia itself was dissolved in 1952 and replaced by three Bezirke (districts) in a local government reform; Weimar belonged to the Bezirk of Erfurt.) The city was the headquarters of the Soviet Union&#x27;s 8th Guards Army as part of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. Due to its fame and importance for tourism, Weimar received more financial subsidies from the GDR government and remained in better condition than most East German cities.
After German reunification in 1990, Weimar experienced significant economic hardship, but funding restored much that had deteriorated. In 1991, the city hosted the first trilateral meeting between the foreign ministers of Germany, France and Poland giving its name to the Weimar Triangle format. It was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996 (Bauhaus) and 1998 (Classical Weimar). The European Council of Ministers selected the city as European Capital of Culture for 1999. Tourism has become an important economic factor over the decades. Weimar is now a popular residence of people working in Erfurt and Jena, both less than 20 minutes away.

In 2004, a fire broke out at the Duchess Anna Amalia Library. The library contains a 13,000-volume collection including Goethe&#x27;s masterpiece &quot;Faust&quot;, as well as the duchess&#x27;s music collection. An authentic Luther Bible from 1534 was saved from the fire. The library is one of the oldest in Europe, dating back to 1691, and is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Over one million volumes were housed in the library, of which forty to fifty thousand were damaged beyond repair. A number of books were shock-frozen in Leipzig to save them from rotting. The library was reopened in 2007.

== Geography and demographics ==
=== Topography ===
Weimar is situated within the valley of the Ilm river, a tributary of the Saale river on the southern border of the Thuringian Basin, a fertile agricultural area between the Harz mountains to the north and the Thuringian Forest to the southwest. The municipal terrain is hilly; the height of the city centre in the Ilm valley is approximately 200 m of elevation. To the north, the terrain rises to Ettersberg, the city&#x27;s backyard mountain, 482 m in height. The range of hills in the south of Weimar rises up to 370 m and is part of the Ilm Saale Plate Muschelkalk formation. The eastern, central and western parts of the municipal territory are in agricultural use, whereas the Ettersberg and some southern areas are wooded.

=== Climate ===
Weimar has a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;) or an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) according to the Köppen climate classification system. Summers are warm and sometimes humid with average high temperatures of and lows of . Winters are relatively cold with average high temperatures of and lows of . The city&#x27;s topography creates a microclimate caused through the basin position with sometimes inversion in winter (quite cold nights under ). Annual precipitation is only with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Light snowfall occurs, mainly from December through February, but snow cover does not usually remain for long.

The Weimar (Erfurt–Weimar Airport) weather station has recorded the following extreme values:
* Its highest temperature was on 20 July 2022.
* Its lowest temperature was on 11 January 1982.
* Its greatest annual precipitation was in 2002.
* Its least annual precipitation was in 1982.
* The longest annual sunshine was 2,039.4 hours in 2022.
* The shortest annual sunshine was 1,341 hours in 1977.

=== Administrative division ===

Weimar abuts the district of Weimarer Land with the municipalities Berlstedt, Ettersburg, Kleinobringen, Großobringen and Wohlsborn in the north, Kromsdorf, Umpferstedt and Mellingen in the east, Vollersroda, Buchfart, Hetschburg, Bad Berka and Troistedt in the south and Nohra, Daasdorf am Berge, Hopfgarten and Ottstedt am Berge in the west.

The city itself is divided into 10 inner urban and 11 suburban districts. The centre is formed by the district &quot;Altstadt&quot; (old town) and the Gründerzeit districts &quot;Nordvorstadt&quot; in the north, &quot;Parkvorstadt&quot; in the east and &quot;Westvorstadt&quot; in the south and west. Later additions are &quot;Südstadt&quot; in the south and &quot;Schönblick&quot; in the southwest. Finally, there are the Plattenbau settlements, constructed during the GDR period, &quot;Weststadt&quot; and &quot;Nordstadt&quot; as well as two industrial areas in the north and west.

The 11 suburban districts are villages which became incorporated during the 20th century; however, they have mostly stayed rural to date: 
*Gaberndorf (incorporated in 1994)
*Gelmeroda (1994)
*Legefeld/Holzdorf (1994)
*Niedergrunstedt (1994)
*Oberweimar/Ehringsdorf (1922)
*Possendorf (1994)
*Schöndorf (1939)
*Süßenborn (1994)
*Taubach (1994)
*Tiefurt (1922)
*Tröbsdorf (1994)

=== Demographics ===
Over the centuries, Weimar remained a small town of less than 5,000 inhabitants. When it became the capital of Saxe-Weimar in 1572, population growth was stimulated and the population increased from 3,000 in 1650 to 6,000 in 1750. Around the year 1800, Weimar had 7,000 inhabitants. Their number grew constantly over the years to 13,000 in 1850, 28,000 in 1900 and 35,000 at the beginning of World War I. During the interwar period, the new capital of Thuringia saw a population boom, which led to 65,000 inhabitants in 1940. Since that time, the population levels have stagnated. The years 2009 to 2012 brought a moderate growth of approximately 0.35% per year, whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Weimar. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders.

The birth surplus was +3 in 2012, this is +0.0 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: −4.5; national average: −2.4). The net migration rate was +4.5 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6). The most important regions of origin are rural areas of Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony as well as foreign countries like Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria.

Like other eastern German cities, Weimar has a relatively small foreign population (compared to the German average): circa 4.0% are non-Germans by citizenship, while 7.9% have a migrant background (according to 2011 EU census). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Weimar are Vietnamese people, Russians and Ukrainians. During recent years, the economic situation of the city improved: the unemployment rate declined from 20% in 2005 to 5.1% in 2019. Due to the official atheism in the former GDR, most of the population is non-religious. 21.1% are members of the Evangelical Church in Central Germany and 6.8% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==
===World Heritage Sites===
Two World Heritage Sites converge in Weimar: 
*The Classical Weimar World Heritage Site consists of 11 sites related to Weimar as a European centre of the Enlightenment during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.
*The Bauhaus and its Sites in Weimar, Dessau and Bernau World Heritage Site comprises six separate sites, two in Weimar, which are associated with the Bauhaus art school, which had a revolutionary influence on 20th century architectural and aesthetic thinking and practice.

=== Cityscape ===
The historic city centre of Weimar is situated between the Ilm river in the east, Grabenstraße in the north, Goetheplatz and Theaterplatz in the west and Schillerstraße in the south. Its two central squares are the Marktplatz in the south (with the town hall) and the Herderplatz in the north (with the main church). Despite its medieval origin, there are only a few medieval buildings, many being destroyed by frequent fires throughout the city&#x27;s history. Most buildings in this area date back to the 17th and 18th century. Furthermore, Weimar has two old suburbs: in the north, the &quot;Jakobsvorstadt&quot; around St. James&#x27; Church (medieval origin) and another one in the south around Frauenplan square. The majority of buildings in these areas are also of 17th- and 18th-century origin. During the late 19th and early 20th century, Weimar grew in all directions. Because of its function as an &quot;officials&#x27; city&quot;, the houses in these areas are more substantial than in many comparable Gründerzeit quarters in Germany. The most uptown areas are those right and left of the &quot;Park an der Ilm&quot; in the southeast, whereas the western and northern quarters are more basic and mixed with industrial areas in their outer parts. During the GDR period, two new Plattenbau settlements were developed in the west and the north of the city. After 1990, suburbanization occurred for a short time and the rural districts of Weimar saw significant growth as part of the larger city.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===
==== Religious buildings ====
The city&#x27;s main church is the Evangelical St. Peter and Paul on the Herderplatz (known as Die Herderkirche). It was rebuilt in late Gothic style after a fire around 1500. Between 1726 and 1735, the interior underwent a Baroque remodelling by Johann Adolf Richter. Johann Gottfried Herder was the dean of the church between 1766 and 1803. The second old Evangelical church of Weimar is St. James on Rollplatz, rebuilt in 1712 in Baroque style. The Roman Catholic parish church of Weimar is dedicated to the Sacred Heart and was built between 1888 and 1891 in historicist forms imitating Florence Cathedral. Another church is the Russian Orthodox Chapel within the historic cemetery. It was built in 1862 as the funerary chapel of Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna and was one of the first Russian-styled buildings in Germany.

Interesting churches in the suburban districts are the Lutheran parish church of Gelmeroda, which was the inspiration for many paintings by Lyonel Feininger, and the Lutheran parish church of Oberweimar, which was a former monastery, and is a good example of Gothic architecture in Weimar.
==== Castles and palaces ====
Due to its function as a ducal residence, Weimar is rich in early-modern castles and palaces. The biggest one is the &quot;Stadtschloss&quot; at Burgplatz in the city centre. Today&#x27;s four-wing building was started after a great fire in 1774. The tower and the Bastille building at its south-western edge are relics of older castles in this place.

The &quot;Fürstenhaus&quot; at Platz der Demokratie was the first parliament building in Weimar, established in the 1770s. Today it is in use by the Weimar School of Music. The &quot;Green Castle&quot; next to the Fürstenhaus was built in the 1560s in Renaissance style and hosts today the Duchess Anna Amalia Library. The &quot;Yellow Castle&quot; at Grüner Markt was built in 1703 and is the municipal library today. The neighbouring &quot;Red Castle&quot; is also part of the library and was built in the 1570s. The &quot;Wittumspalais&quot; is a smaller widow mansion near Theaterplatz, established in 1768. Outbildings of the ducal residence are the &quot;Husarenstall&quot; (1770), the later residence of Charlotte von Stein at Ackerwand street, the &quot;Marstall&quot; (1870s) at Kegelplatz, today used as Thuringian State Archive and the &quot;Reithaus&quot; (1710s) within the &quot;Park an der Ilm&quot;.
Furthermore, there are some impressive ducal country residences around Weimar. They are marked by their beautiful parks and gardens. Schloss Belvedere, south-east of Weimar was built between 1724 and 1732 in Baroque style with an orangery near to a ducal hunting forest. North-east of Weimar, at Ettersburg lies another ducal hunting lodge next to the Ettersberg mountain and its forest, Schloss Ettersburg. It was established between 1706 and 1711 also in Baroque style. The third summer residence, Schloss Tiefurt, is located in Tiefurt, north-east of Weimar. The small lodge in a wide park in Ilm valley was rebuilt in 1775 in late-Baroque forms.
==== Other sights ====
*The town hall at Marktplatz was built between 1837 and 1841 in Neo-Gothic style by &quot;Heinrich Heß&quot; after the former one (15th-century) burnt down. 
*The two main buildings of Bauhaus University at Marienstraße are icons of 20th-century early-modern architecture. Both were built by Henry van de Velde between 1904 and 1911. They mark the transition from older Historicism and Art Nouveau to the new international modern style in Germany by their functional forms (e. g. skylights for better working conditions inside). 
*The German National Theatre at Theaterplatz was built in 1906/07 in neo-classicist forms. Two predecessors were in use after 1779 and 1825 as ducal court theatres during Weimar&#x27;s golden age. In 1919, the Weimar National Assembly developed the Weimar Constitution in this theatre.
*The &quot;Gauforum&quot; at Weimarplatz is a Roman-fascist style representative government district between the city centre and the main station. This Gauforum, designed by Hermann Giesler, was the only realized Nazi government district outside Berlin (whereas there were plans for all German state capitals). Today it hosts the Thuringian Administration State Department.
*The &quot;Park an der Ilm&quot; is the city&#x27;s largest park along Ilm river between the ducal palace and the district of Oberweimar. It was established between 1778 and 1833 and is an English landscape garden today, part of UNESCO world heritage. Sights inside the park are &quot;Goethe&#x27;s garden house&quot; (1690s) and &quot;Römisches Haus&quot; (in the style of a Roman temple, 1790s). 
*The Historic Cemetery at Karl-Haußknecht-Straße was opened in 1818 and hosts the graves of Goethe, Schiller and many other famous people from Weimar. 
*The &quot;Goethe-Schiller-Denkmal&quot; at Theaterplatz is the most famous memorial in Weimar. It was made by Ernst Rietschel between 1852 and 1857 and is dedicated to Goethe and Schiller, the most important poets of German classical literature.
*A rather unknown monument is the Lenin-light-box inside the theatre hall &quot;La Redoute&quot;. It&#x27;s a copy of a stained window by Alexander Leonidovich Korolev that shows Lenin in Petrograd (St. Petersburg).
=== Events ===
The Onion Market (Weimarer Zwiebelmarkt) is an annual festival held in October in Weimar and it is Thuringia&#x27;s largest festival. The festival is held over 3 days and approximately 500 stalls and more than 100 stage performances are put up across the city.

Weimar first celebrated the Onion Market in 1653. Stalls typically offer onion plaits, themed arts and crafts and numerous onion-based foods, including onion cakes, onion soups and onion breads. The festival also hosts numerous beer gardens, live music, fairground attractions and a Ferris wheel.

There are several clubs with live music once or twice a week. There is also a student club in the city centre which also features disco and live music events on Friday- and Saturday nights (Kasseturm). There are several smaller theatre and cabaret venues other than the large &quot;DNT&quot; (Deutsches National Theater). There are four cinemas including a 3-D cinema, and a Bowling Alley in the Weimar Atrium, the local mall.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
===Agriculture, industry and services ===
The area around Weimar is relatively fertile and 48% of the municipal surface are used for agricultural production. Most common agricultures are cereals, maize and rapeseed, while famous agricultural products from the Weimar region are potatoes (especially from Heichelheim, to the north) for dishes with Thuringian dumplings (Knödel from potatoes), onions (from Heldrungen and Oldisleben, to the north), which are sold at Weimar Onion Market in October, and Saale-Unstrut wine from Bad Sulza, to the north-east.

Industry has never been dominant in Weimar, nevertheless there were several big factories from different sectors until 1990. After reunification, nearly all factories got closed, either because they failed the adoption of free market economy or because the German government sold them to west German businessmen who closed them to avoid competition to their own enterprises. On the other hand, the federal government started early in the 1990s to subsidize the foundation of new companies, but it took long time before the economic situation got stabilized around 2006. Since this time, unemployment decreased and overall, new jobs develop. Today, there are many small and medium-sized companies in Weimar with electro-technics and engineering in focus. Nevertheless, settlement of new factories isn&#x27;t much in focus of the local government, because it concentrates itself on developing tourism and services. The biggest companies with production in Weimar are Bayer (pharmaceutical factory), Coca-Cola (beverages) and Hydrema (dump truck factory). A new big commercial zone was established in the 1990s in the neighbouring municipality of Nohra with focus on logistics and distribution.

Due to its tradition as a capital, Weimar is a centre of governmental services to date. Furthermore, creative branches like media, advertising, architecture and design are important for Weimar&#x27;s economy. The most important sector is tourism with 3,500 hotel beds, 350,000 visitors and 650,000 overnight stays in hotels in 2012 and a large number of German one-day visitors. Other services like retail, trade fairs and specialized hospitals are more brought by the near neighbour cities Erfurt and Jena with their infrastructure.

===Transport===
==== By rail ====

Weimar is connected by the Thuringian Railway to Leipzig in the east and to Frankfurt/Kassel in the west. Furthermore, there are some regional railways to Gera via Jena and to Kranichfeld via Bad Berka. Today, there are long-distance trains to Frankfurt via Erfurt and Fulda and to Dresden via Leipzig and regional trains to Göttingen and Eisenach via Erfurt, to Halle via Naumburg, to Altenburg, Glauchau, Zwickau and Greiz via Jena and Gera and to Kranichfeld. After the new Erfurt–Leipzig/Halle high-speed railway was opened in 2015, Weimar was disconnected from the German long-distance train network. However the regional train service are augmented to connect Weimar with ICE-stops in Erfurt, Halle and Leipzig.

In freight transport exists an intermodal terminal in Vieselbach &quot;(Güterverkehrszentrum/GVZ)&quot; with connection to rail and Autobahn, west of Weimar.

==== By road ====
Weimar is located at the Bundesautobahn 4 (Frankfurt–Dresden). Furthermore, there are two federal roads to Erfurt and Jena (Bundesstraße 7) and to Rudolstadt and Kölleda (Bundesstraße 85) as well as some regional roads to Sömmerda, Oßmannstedt and Magdala. A bypass road around Weimar was built in the 2000s in the north and west; the eastern and southern continuation are in discussion, but not in definite planning because of some difficulties in routing.

==== By aviation ====
The Erfurt-Weimar Airport lies approximately west of Weimar. It was largely extended in the 1990s, but the anticipated rise in passengers did not occur so that there is only rare air traffic, mostly to Mediterranean holiday regions. Other flights are carried out via Frankfurt Airport, which can be reached in 3 hours, and via Berlin Brandenburg Airport, which is also about 3 hours away.

==== By bike ====
Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. For tourism, there are the &quot;Ilm track&quot; and the &quot;Thuringian city string track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)&quot;. Both connect points of tourist interest, the first along the Ilm valley from the Thuringian Forest to the Saale river and the second close to medieval Via Regia from Eisenach via Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar, and Jena to Altenburg. Additionally, there are themed routes like the Goethe cycle track and the Feininger cycle track. For inner city everyday traffic, some cycle lanes exist along several main streets. Bike rental is offered in the city centre.

==== Bus service ====
For a small city, Weimar is well served by city bus routes, which also serve all of the surrounding towns and villages. An hourly bus route serves the Buchenwald Memorial and oldtimer buses operate in the city&#x27;s historical centre. All bus routes are connected at Goethe Square in the city centre, and many also serve the main railway station. Trams served the city from 1899 to 1937. Trolleybus service started in 1948 and was discontinued in 1993.

===Education===

After the reunification, the educational system was realigned. Some academies were combined into the new Bauhaus University, founded in 1996 with approximately 4,200 students and focus on architecture, design and media. The Liszt School of Music is a university focussed on music and music education founded in 1872 with 850 students today. Furthermore, there are three regular Gymnasiums, the &quot;Musikgymnasium Schloss Belvedere&quot;, an elite boarding school with focus on music, and the Thuringia International School with an international (and foreign language) curriculum.

The most important archives in Weimar are the &quot;Goethe- und Schiller-Archiv&quot; (member of UNESCO Memory of the World Programme) with focus on German literary history and the Thuringia Main State Archive with governmental documents from last 500 years. The Duchess Anna Amalia Library hosts books and documents of German literary and cultural history.

<doc id="47200" wikidata="Q3030" url="?curid=47200" title="4 Vesta">
<text>Vesta (minor-planet designation: 4 Vesta) is one of the largest objects in the asteroid belt, with a mean diameter of . It was discovered by the German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers on 29 March 1807 and is named after Vesta, the virgin goddess of home and hearth from Roman mythology.

Vesta is thought to be the second-largest asteroid, both by mass and by volume, after the dwarf planet Ceres. Measurements give it a nominal volume only slightly larger than that of Pallas (about 5% greater), but it is 25% to 30% more massive. It constitutes an estimated 9% of the mass of the asteroid belt. Vesta is the only known remaining rocky protoplanet (with a differentiated interior) of the kind that formed the terrestrial planets. Numerous fragments of Vesta were ejected by collisions one and two billion years ago that left two enormous craters occupying much of Vesta&#x27;s southern hemisphere. Debris from these events has fallen to Earth as howardite–eucrite–diogenite (HED) meteorites, which have been a rich source of information about Vesta.

Vesta is the brightest asteroid visible from Earth. It is regularly as bright as magnitude 5.1, at which times it is faintly visible to the naked eye. Its maximum distance from the Sun is slightly greater than the minimum distance of Ceres from the Sun, although its orbit lies entirely within that of Ceres.

NASA&#x27;s &quot;Dawn&quot; spacecraft entered orbit around Vesta on 16 July 2011 for a one-year exploration and left the orbit of Vesta on 5 September 2012 en route to its final destination, Ceres. Researchers continue to examine data collected by &quot;Dawn&quot; for additional insights into the formation and history of Vesta.

==History==

===Discovery===

Heinrich Olbers discovered Pallas in 1802, the year after the discovery of Ceres. He proposed that the two objects were the remnants of a destroyed planet. He sent a letter with his proposal to the British astronomer William Herschel, suggesting that a search near the locations where the orbits of Ceres and Pallas intersected might reveal more fragments. These orbital intersections were located in the constellations of Cetus and Virgo. Olbers commenced his search in 1802, and on 29 March 1807 he discovered Vesta in the constellation Virgo—a coincidence, because Ceres, Pallas, and Vesta are not fragments of a larger body. Because the asteroid Juno had been discovered in 1804, this made Vesta the fourth object to be identified in the region that is now known as the asteroid belt. The discovery was announced in a letter addressed to German astronomer Johann H. Schröter dated 31 March. Because Olbers already had credit for discovering a planet (Pallas; at the time, the asteroids were considered to be planets), he gave the honor of naming his new discovery to German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, whose orbital calculations had enabled astronomers to confirm the existence of Ceres, the first asteroid, and who had computed the orbit of the new planet in the remarkably short time of 10 hours. Gauss decided on the Roman virgin goddess of home and hearth, Vesta.

===Name and symbol===
Vesta was the fourth asteroid to be discovered, hence the number 4 in its formal designation. The name &quot;Vesta&quot;, or national variants thereof, is in international use with two exceptions: Greece and China. In Greek, the name adopted was the Hellenic equivalent of Vesta, Hestia in English, that name is used for (Greeks use the name &quot;Hestia&quot; for both, with the minor-planet numbers used for disambiguation). In Chinese, Vesta is called the &#x27;hearth-god(dess) star&#x27;, &quot;&quot;, naming the asteroid for Vesta&#x27;s role, similar to the Chinese names of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto.

Upon its discovery, Vesta was, like Ceres, Pallas, and Juno before it, classified as a planet and given a planetary symbol. The symbol represented the altar of Vesta with its sacred fire and was designed by Gauss. In Gauss&#x27;s conception, now obsolete, this was drawn . His form is in the pipeline for Unicode 17.0 as U+1F777 .
The asteroid symbols were gradually retired from astronomical use after 1852, but the symbols for the first four asteroids were resurrected for astrology in the 1970s. The abbreviated modern astrological variant of the Vesta symbol is .

After the discovery of Vesta, no further objects were discovered for 38 years, and during this time the Solar System was thought to have eleven planets. However, in 1845, new asteroids started being discovered at a rapid pace, and by 1851 there were fifteen, each with its own symbol, in addition to the eight major planets (Neptune had been discovered in 1846). It soon became clear that it would be impractical to continue inventing new planetary symbols indefinitely, and some of the existing ones proved difficult to draw quickly. That year, the problem was addressed by Benjamin Apthorp Gould, who suggested numbering asteroids in their order of discovery, and placing this number in a disk (circle) as the generic symbol of an asteroid. Thus, the fourth asteroid, Vesta, acquired the generic symbol . This was soon coupled with the name into an official number–name designation, as the number of minor planets increased. By 1858, the circle had been simplified to parentheses, which were easier to typeset. Other punctuation, such as and was also briefly used, but had more or less completely died out by 1949.

===Early measurements===
Photometric observations of Vesta were made at the Harvard College Observatory in 1880–1882 and at the Observatoire de Toulouse in 1909. These and other observations allowed the rotation rate of Vesta to be determined by the 1950s. However, the early estimates of the rotation rate came into question because the light curve included variations in both shape and albedo.

Early estimates of the diameter of Vesta ranged from in 1825, to . E.C. Pickering produced an estimated diameter of in 1879, which is close to the modern value for the mean diameter, but the subsequent estimates ranged from a low of up to a high of during the next century. The measured estimates were based on photometry. In 1989, speckle interferometry was used to measure a dimension that varied between during the rotational period. In 1991, an occultation of the star SAO 93228 by Vesta was observed from multiple locations in the eastern United States and Canada. Based on observations from 14 different sites, the best fit to the data was an elliptical profile with dimensions of about . &quot;Dawn&quot; confirmed this measurement. These measurements will help determine the thermal history, size of the core, role of water in asteroid evolution and what meteorites found on Earth come from these bodies, with the ultimate goal of understanding the conditions and processes present at the solar system&#x27;s earliest epoch and the role of water content and size in planetary evolution.

Vesta became the first asteroid to have its mass determined. Every 18 years, the asteroid 197 Arete approaches within of Vesta. In 1966, based upon observations of Vesta&#x27;s gravitational perturbations of Arete, Hans G. Hertz estimated the mass of Vesta at (solar masses). More refined estimates followed, and in 2001 the perturbations of 17 Thetis were used to calculate the mass of Vesta to be . &quot;Dawn&quot; determined it to be .

==Orbit==
Vesta orbits the Sun between Mars and Jupiter, within the asteroid belt, with a period of 3.6 Earth years, specifically in the inner asteroid belt, interior to the Kirkwood gap at 2.50 AU. Its orbit is moderately inclined (&quot;i&quot; = 7.1°, compared to 7° for Mercury and 17° for Pluto) and moderately eccentric (&quot;e&quot; = 0.09, about the same as for Mars).

True orbital resonances between asteroids are considered unlikely. Because of their small masses relative to their large separations, such relationships should be very rare. Nevertheless, Vesta is able to capture other asteroids into temporary 1:1 resonant orbital relationships (for periods up to 2 million years or more) and about forty such objects have been identified. Decameter-sized objects detected in the vicinity of Vesta by &quot;Dawn&quot; may be such quasi-satellites rather than proper satellites.

==Rotation==

Vesta&#x27;s rotation is relatively fast for an asteroid (5.342 h) and prograde, with the north pole pointing in the direction of right ascension 20 h 32 min, declination +48° (in the constellation Cygnus) with an uncertainty of about 10°. This gives an axial tilt of 29°.

==Coordinate systems==
Two longitudinal coordinate systems are used for Vesta, with prime meridians separated by 150°. The IAU established a coordinate system in 1997 based on &quot;Hubble&quot; photos, with the prime meridian running through the center of Olbers Regio, a dark feature 200 km across. When &quot;Dawn&quot; arrived at Vesta, mission scientists found that the location of the pole assumed by the IAU was off by 10°, so that the IAU coordinate system drifted across the surface of Vesta at 0.06° per year, and also that Olbers Regio was not discernible from up close, and so was not adequate to define the prime meridian with the precision they needed. They corrected the pole, but also established a new prime meridian 4° from the center of Claudia, a sharply defined crater 700 meters across, which they say results in a more logical set of mapping quadrangles. All NASA publications, including images and maps of Vesta, use the Claudian meridian, which is unacceptable to the IAU. The IAU Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements recommended a coordinate system, correcting the pole but rotating the Claudian longitude by 150° to coincide with Olbers Regio. It was accepted by the IAU, although it disrupts the maps prepared by the &quot;Dawn&quot; team, which had been positioned so they would not bisect any major surface features.

==Physical characteristics==

Vesta is the second most massive body in the asteroid belt, although it is only 28% as massive as Ceres, the most massive body. Vesta is however the most massive body that formed in the asteroid belt, as Ceres is believed to have formed between Jupiter and Saturn. Vesta&#x27;s density is lower than those of the four terrestrial planets but is higher than those of most asteroids, as well as all of the moons in the Solar System except Io. Vesta&#x27;s surface area is about the same as the land area of Pakistan, Venezuela, Tanzania, or Nigeria; slightly under . It has a differentiated interior. Vesta is only slightly larger () than 2 Pallas () in mean diameter, but is about 25% more massive.

Vesta&#x27;s shape is close to a gravitationally relaxed oblate spheroid, but the large concavity and protrusion at the southern pole (see &#x27;Surface features&#x27; below) combined with a mass less than precluded Vesta from automatically being considered a dwarf planet under International Astronomical Union (IAU) Resolution XXVI 5. A 2012 analysis of Vesta&#x27;s shape and gravity field using data gathered by the &quot;Dawn&quot; spacecraft has shown that Vesta is currently not in hydrostatic equilibrium.

Temperatures on the surface have been estimated to lie between about with the Sun overhead, dropping to about at the winter pole. Typical daytime and nighttime temperatures are and , respectively. This estimate is for 6 May 1996, very close to perihelion, although details vary somewhat with the seasons.

==Surface features==

Before the arrival of the &quot;Dawn&quot; spacecraft, some Vestan surface features had already been resolved using the Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes (e.g., the Keck Observatory). The arrival of &quot;Dawn&quot; in July 2011 revealed the complex surface of Vesta in detail.

===Rheasilvia and Veneneia===

The most prominent of these surface features are two enormous impact basins, the -wide Rheasilvia, centered near the south pole; and the wide Veneneia. The Rheasilvia impact basin is younger and overlies the Veneneia. The &quot;Dawn&quot; science team named the younger, more prominent crater Rheasilvia, after the mother of Romulus and Remus and a mythical vestal virgin. Its width is 95% of the mean diameter of Vesta. The crater is about deep. A central peak rises above the lowest measured part of the crater floor and the highest measured part of the crater rim is above the crater floor low point. It is estimated that the impact responsible excavated about 1% of the volume of Vesta, and it is likely that the Vesta family and V-type asteroids are the products of this collision. If this is the case, then the fact that fragments have survived bombardment until the present indicates that the crater is at most only about 1 billion years old. It would also be the site of origin of the HED meteorites. All the known V-type asteroids taken together account for only about 6% of the ejected volume, with the rest presumably either in small fragments, ejected by approaching the 3:1 Kirkwood gap, or perturbed away by the Yarkovsky effect or radiation pressure. Spectroscopic analyses of the Hubble images have shown that this crater has penetrated deep through several distinct layers of the crust, and possibly into the mantle, as indicated by spectral signatures of olivine.

The large peak at the center of Rheasilvia is high and wide, and is possibly a result of a planetary-scale impact.

===Other craters===

Several old, degraded craters approach Rheasilvia and Veneneia in size, although none are quite so large. They include Feralia Planitia, shown at right, which is across. More-recent, sharper craters range up to Varronilla and Postumia.

Dust fills up some craters, creating so-called dust ponds. They are a phenomenon where pockets of dust are seen in celestial bodies without a significant atmosphere. These are smooth deposits of dust accumulated in depressions on the surface of the body (like craters), contrasting from the Rocky terrain around them. On the surface of Vesta, we have identified both type 1 (formed from impact melt) and type 2 (electrostatically made) dust ponds within 0˚–30°N/S, that is, Equatorial region. 10 craters have been identified with such formations.

====&quot;Snowman craters&quot;====
The &quot;snowman craters&quot; are a group of three adjacent craters in Vesta&#x27;s northern hemisphere. Their official names, from largest to smallest (west to east), are Marcia, Calpurnia, and Minucia. Marcia is the youngest and cross-cuts Calpurnia. Minucia is the oldest.

===Troughs===
The majority of the equatorial region of Vesta is sculpted by a series of parallel troughs designated Divalia Fossae; its longest trough is wide and long. Despite the fact that Vesta is a one-seventh the size of the Moon, Divalia Fossae dwarfs the Grand Canyon. A second series, inclined to the equator, is found further north. This northern trough system is named Saturnalia Fossae, with its largest trough being roughly 40 km wide and over 370 km long. These troughs are thought to be large-scale graben resulting from the impacts that created Rheasilvia and Veneneia craters, respectively. They are some of the longest chasms in the Solar System, nearly as long as Ithaca Chasma on Tethys. The troughs may be graben that formed after another asteroid collided with Vesta, a process that can happen only in a body that, like Vesta, is differentiated. Vesta&#x27;s differentiation is one of the reasons why scientists consider it a protoplanet. Alternatively, it is proposed that the troughs may be radial sculptures created by secondary cratering from Rheasilvia.

===Surface composition===
Compositional information from the visible and infrared spectrometer (VIR), gamma-ray and neutron detector (GRaND), and framing camera (FC), all indicate that the majority of the surface composition of Vesta is consistent with the composition of the howardite, eucrite, and diogenite meteorites. The Rheasilvia region is richest in diogenite, consistent with the Rheasilvia-forming impact excavating material from deeper within Vesta. The presence of olivine within the Rheasilvia region would also be consistent with excavation of mantle material. However, olivine has only been detected in localized regions of the northern hemisphere, not within Rheasilvia. The origin of this olivine is currently unclear. Though olivine was expected by astronomers to have originated from Vesta&#x27;s mantle prior to the arrival of the &quot;Dawn&quot; orbiter, the lack of olivine within the Rheasilvia and Veneneia impact basins complicates this view. Both impact basins excavated Vestian material down to 60–100 km, far deeper than the expected thickness of ~30–40 km for Vesta&#x27;s crust. Vesta&#x27;s crust may be far thicker than expected or the violent impact events that created Rheasilvia and Veneneia may have mixed material enough to obscure olivine from observations. Alternatively, &quot;Dawn&quot; observations of olivine could instead be due to delivery by olivine-rich impactors, unrelated to Vesta&#x27;s internal structure.

===Features associated with volatiles===
Pitted terrain has been observed in four craters on Vesta: Marcia, Cornelia, Numisia and Licinia. The formation of the pitted terrain is proposed to be degassing of impact-heated volatile-bearing material. Along with the pitted terrain, curvilinear gullies are found in Marcia and Cornelia craters. The curvilinear gullies end in lobate deposits, which are sometimes covered by pitted terrain, and are proposed to form by the transient flow of liquid water after buried deposits of ice were melted by the heat of the impacts. Hydrated materials have also been detected, many of which are associated with areas of dark material. Consequently, dark material is thought to be largely composed of carbonaceous chondrite, which was deposited on the surface by impacts. Carbonaceous chondrites are comparatively rich in mineralogically bound OH.

==Geology==
A large collection of potential samples from Vesta is accessible to scientists, in the form of over 1200 HED meteorites (Vestan achondrites), giving insight into Vesta&#x27;s geologic history and structure. NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (NASA IRTF) studies of asteroid suggest that it originated from deeper within Vesta than the HED meteorites.

Vesta is thought to consist of a metallic iron–nickel core 214–226 km in diameter, an overlying rocky olivine mantle, with a surface crust. From the first appearance of calcium–aluminium-rich inclusions (the first solid matter in the Solar System, forming about 4.567 billion years ago), a likely time line is as follows:

Vesta is the only known intact asteroid that has been resurfaced in this manner. Because of this, some scientists refer to Vesta as a protoplanet. However, the presence of iron meteorites and achondritic meteorite classes without identified parent bodies indicates that there once were other differentiated planetesimals with igneous histories, which have since been shattered by impacts.
On the basis of the sizes of V-type asteroids (thought to be pieces of Vesta&#x27;s crust ejected during large impacts), and the depth of Rheasilvia crater (see below), the crust is thought to be roughly thick.
Findings from the &quot;Dawn&quot; spacecraft have found evidence that the troughs that wrap around Vesta could be graben formed by impact-induced faulting (see Troughs section above), meaning that Vesta has more complex geology than other asteroids. Vesta&#x27;s differentiated interior implies that it was in hydrostatic equilibrium and thus a dwarf planet in the past, but it is not today. The impacts that created the Rheasilvia and Veneneia craters occurred when Vesta was no longer warm and plastic enough to return to an equilibrium shape, distorting its once rounded shape and prohibiting it from being classified as a dwarf planet today.

===Regolith===
Vesta&#x27;s surface is covered by regolith distinct from that found on the Moon or asteroids such as Itokawa. This is because space weathering acts differently. Vesta&#x27;s surface shows no significant trace of nanophase iron because the impact speeds on Vesta are too low to make rock melting and vaporization an appreciable process. Instead, regolith evolution is dominated by brecciation and subsequent mixing of bright and dark components. The dark component is probably due to the infall of carbonaceous material, whereas the bright component is the original Vesta basaltic soil.

==Fragments==
Some small Solar System bodies are suspected to be fragments of Vesta caused by impacts. The Vestian asteroids and HED meteorites are examples. The V-type asteroid 1929 Kollaa has been determined to have a composition akin to cumulate eucrite meteorites, indicating its origin deep within Vesta&#x27;s crust.

Vesta is currently one of only eight identified Solar System bodies of which we have physical samples, coming from a number of meteorites suspected to be Vestan fragments. It is estimated that 1 out of 16 meteorites originated from Vesta. The other identified Solar System samples are from Earth itself, meteorites from Mars, meteorites from the Moon, and samples returned from the Moon, the comet Wild 2, and the asteroids 25143 Itokawa, 162173 Ryugu, and 101955 Bennu.

==Exploration==

In 1981, a proposal for an asteroid mission was submitted to the European Space Agency (ESA). Named the Asteroidal Gravity Optical and Radar Analysis (AGORA), this spacecraft was to launch some time in 1990–1994 and perform two flybys of large asteroids. The preferred target for this mission was Vesta. AGORA would reach the asteroid belt either by a gravitational slingshot trajectory past Mars or by means of a small ion engine. However, the proposal was refused by the ESA. A joint NASA–ESA asteroid mission was then drawn up for a Multiple Asteroid Orbiter with Solar Electric Propulsion (MAOSEP), with one of the mission profiles including an orbit of Vesta. NASA indicated they were not interested in an asteroid mission. Instead, the ESA set up a technological study of a spacecraft with an ion drive. Other missions to the asteroid belt were proposed in the 1980s by France, Germany, Italy and the United States, but none were approved. Exploration of Vesta by fly-by and impacting penetrator was the second main target of the first plan of the multi-aimed Soviet Vesta mission, developed in cooperation with European countries for realisation in 1991–1994 but canceled due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

In the early 1990s, NASA initiated the Discovery Program, which was intended to be a series of low-cost scientific missions. In 1996, the program&#x27;s study team recommended a mission to explore the asteroid belt using a spacecraft with an ion engine as a high priority. Funding for this program remained problematic for several years, but by 2004 the &quot;Dawn&quot; vehicle had passed its critical design review and construction proceeded.

It launched on 27 September 2007 as the first space mission to Vesta. On 3 May 2011, &quot;Dawn&quot; acquired its first targeting image 1.2 million kilometers from Vesta. On 16 July 2011, NASA confirmed that it received telemetry from &quot;Dawn&quot; indicating that the spacecraft successfully entered Vesta&#x27;s orbit. It was scheduled to orbit Vesta for one year, until July 2012. &quot;Dawn&quot; arrival coincided with late summer in the southern hemisphere of Vesta, with the large crater at Vesta&#x27;s south pole (Rheasilvia) in sunlight. Because a season on Vesta lasts eleven months, the northern hemisphere, including anticipated compression fractures opposite the crater, would become visible to &quot;Dawn&quot; cameras before it left orbit. &quot;Dawn&quot; left orbit around Vesta on 4 September 2012 to travel to Ceres.

NASA/DLR released imagery and summary information from a survey orbit, two high-altitude orbits (60–70 m/pixel) and a low-altitude mapping orbit (20 m/pixel), including digital terrain models, videos and atlases. Scientists also used &quot;Dawn&quot; to calculate Vesta&#x27;s precise mass and gravity field. The subsequent determination of the J2 component yielded a core diameter estimate of about 220 km assuming a crustal density similar to that of the HED.

&quot;Dawn&quot; data can be accessed by the public at the UCLA website.

== Visibility ==
Its size and unusually bright surface make Vesta the brightest asteroid, and it is occasionally visible to the naked eye from dark skies (without light pollution). In May and June 2007, Vesta reached a peak magnitude of +5.4, the brightest since 1989. At that time, opposition and perihelion were only a few weeks apart. It was brighter still at its 22 June 2018 opposition, reaching a magnitude of +5.3.
Less favorable oppositions during late autumn 2008 in the Northern Hemisphere still had Vesta at a magnitude of from +6.5 to +7.3. Even when in conjunction with the Sun, Vesta will have a magnitude around +8.5; thus from a pollution-free sky it can be observed with binoculars even at elongations much smaller than near opposition.

===2010–2011===
In 2010, Vesta reached opposition in the constellation of Leo on the night of 17–18 February, at about magnitude 6.1, a brightness that makes it visible in binocular range but generally not for the naked eye. Under perfect dark sky conditions where all light pollution is absent it might be visible to an experienced observer without the use of a telescope or binoculars. Vesta came to opposition again on 5 August 2011, in the constellation of Capricornus at about magnitude 5.6.

===2012–2013===
Vesta was at opposition again on 9 December 2012. According to &quot;Sky and Telescope&quot; magazine, this year Vesta came within about 6 degrees of 1 Ceres during the winter of 2012 and spring 2013. Vesta orbits the Sun in 3.63 years and Ceres in 4.6 years, so every 17.4 years Vesta overtakes Ceres (the previous overtaking was in April 1996). On 1 December 2012, Vesta had a magnitude of 6.6, but it had decreased to 8.4 by 1 May 2013.

===2014===
Ceres and Vesta came within one degree of each other in the night sky in July 2014.

<doc id="47203" wikidata="Q1137065" url="?curid=47203" title="Orpheus in the Underworld">
<text>Orpheus in the Underworld and Orpheus in Hell are English names for  (), a comic opera with music by Jacques Offenbach and words by Hector Crémieux and Ludovic Halévy. It was first performed as a two-act &quot;opéra bouffon&quot; at the Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens, Paris, on 21 October 1858, and was extensively revised and expanded in a four-act &quot;opéra féerie&quot; version, presented at the Théâtre de la Gaîté, Paris, on 7 February 1874.

The opera is a lampoon of the ancient legend of Orpheus and Eurydice. In this version Orpheus is not the son of Apollo but a rustic violin teacher. He is glad to be rid of his wife, Eurydice, when she is abducted by the god of the underworld, Pluto. Orpheus has to be bullied by Public Opinion into trying to rescue Eurydice. The reprehensible conduct of the gods of Olympus in the opera was widely seen as a veiled satire of the court and government of Napoleon III, Emperor of the French. Some critics expressed outrage at the librettists&#x27; disrespect for classic mythology and the composer&#x27;s parody of Gluck&#x27;s opera ; others praised the piece highly.

 was Offenbach&#x27;s first full-length opera. The original 1858 production became a box-office success, and ran well into the following year, rescuing Offenbach and his Bouffes company from financial difficulty. The 1874 revival broke records at the Gaîté&#x27;s box-office. The work was frequently staged in France and internationally during the composer&#x27;s lifetime and throughout the 20th century. It is one of his most often performed operas, and continues to be revived in the 21st century.

In the last decade of the 19th century the Paris cabarets the Moulin Rouge and Folies Bergère adopted the music of the &quot;Galop infernal&quot; from the culminating scene of the opera to accompany the can-can, and ever since then the tune has been popularly associated with the dance.

==Background and first productions==

Between 1855 and 1858 Offenbach presented more than two dozen one-act operettas, first at the Bouffes-Parisiens, Salle Lacaze, and then at the Bouffes-Parisiens, Salle Choiseul. The theatrical licensing laws then permitted him only four singers in any piece, and with such small casts, full-length works were out of the question. In 1858 the licensing restrictions were relaxed, and Offenbach was free to go ahead with a two-act work that had been in his mind for some time. Two years earlier he had told his friend the writer Hector Crémieux that when he was musical director of the Comédie-Française in the early 1850s he swore revenge for the boredom he suffered from the posturings of mythical heroes and gods of Olympus in the plays presented there. Cremieux and Ludovic Halévy sketched out a libretto for him lampooning such characters. By 1858, when Offenbach was finally allowed a large enough cast to do the theme justice, Halévy was preoccupied with his work as a senior civil servant, and the final libretto was credited to Crémieux alone. Most of the roles were written with popular members of the Bouffes company in mind, including Désiré, Léonce, Lise Tautin, and Henri Tayau as an Orphée who could actually play Orpheus&#x27;s violin.
The first performance took place at the Salle Choiseul on 21 October 1858. At first the piece did reasonably well at the box-office but was not the tremendous success Offenbach had hoped for. He insisted on lavish stagings for his operas: expenses were apt to outrun receipts, and he was in need of a substantial money-spinner. Business received an inadvertent boost from the critic Jules Janin of the . He had praised earlier productions at the Bouffes-Parisiens but was roused to vehement indignation at what he maintained was a blasphemous, lascivious outrage – &quot;a profanation of holy and glorious antiquity&quot;. His attack, and the irreverent public ripostes by Crémieux and Offenbach, made headlines and provoked huge interest in the piece among the Parisian public, who flocked to see it. In his 1980 study of Offenbach, Alexander Faris writes, &quot; became not only a triumph, but a cult.&quot; It ran for 228 performances, at a time when a run of 100 nights was considered a success. Albert Lasalle, in his history of the Bouffes-Parisiens (1860), wrote that the piece closed in June 1859 – although it was still performing strongly at the box-office – &quot;because the actors, who could not tire the public, were themselves exhausted&quot;.

In 1874 Offenbach substantially expanded the piece, doubling the length of the score and turning the intimate opéra bouffon of 1858 into a four-act opéra féerie extravaganza, with substantial ballet sequences. This version opened at the Théâtre de la Gaîté on 7 February 1874, ran for 290 performances, and broke box-office records for that theatre. During the first run of the revised version Offenbach expanded it even further, adding ballets illustrating the kingdom of Neptune in Act 3 and bringing the total number of scenes in the four acts to twenty-two.
==Roles==
==Synopsis==
===Original two-act version===
====Act 1, Scene 1: The countryside near Thebes, Ancient Greece====
A spoken introduction with orchestral accompaniment (Introduction and Melodrame) opens the work. Public Opinion explains who she is – the guardian of morality (). She says that unlike the chorus in Ancient Greek plays she does not merely comment on the action, but intervenes in it, to make sure the story maintains a high moral tone. Her efforts are hampered by the facts of the matter: Orphée is not the son of Apollo, as in classical myth, but a rustic teacher of music, whose dislike of his wife, Eurydice, is heartily reciprocated. She is in love with the shepherd, Aristée (Aristaeus), who lives next door (), and Orphée is in love with Chloë, a shepherdess. When Orphée mistakes Eurydice for her, everything comes out, and Eurydice insists they abandon the marriage. Orphée, fearing Public Opinion&#x27;s reaction, torments his wife into keeping the scandal quiet using violin music, which she hates ().
Aristée enters. Though seemingly a shepherd he is in reality Pluton (Pluto), God of the Underworld. He keeps up his disguise by singing a pastoral song about sheep (). Eurydice has discovered what she thinks is a plot by Orphée to kill Aristée – letting snakes loose in the fields – but is in fact a conspiracy between Orphée and Pluton to kill her, so that Pluton may have her and Orphée be rid of her. Pluton tricks her into walking into the trap by showing immunity to it, and she is bitten. As she dies, Pluton transforms into his true form (Transformation Scene). Eurydice finds that death is not so bad when the God of Death is in love with one (). They descend into the Underworld as soon as Eurydice has left a note telling her husband she has been unavoidably detained.

All seems to be going well for Orphée until Public Opinion catches up with him, and threatens to ruin his violin teaching career unless he goes to rescue his wife. Orphée reluctantly agrees.

====Act 1, Scene 2: Olympus====
The scene changes to Olympus, where the Gods are sleeping (). Cupidon and Vénus enter separately from amatory nocturnal escapades and join their sleeping colleagues, but everyone is soon woken by the sound of the horn of Diane, supposedly chaste huntress and goddess. She laments the sudden absence of Actaeon, her current love (); to her indignation, Jupiter tells her he has turned Actaeon into a stag to protect her reputation. Mercury arrives and reports that he has visited the Underworld, to which Pluton has just returned with a beautiful woman. Pluton enters, and is taken to task by Jupiter for his scandalous private life. To Pluton&#x27;s relief the other Gods choose this moment to revolt against Jupiter&#x27;s reign, their boring diet of ambrosia and nectar, and the sheer tedium of Olympus (). Jupiter&#x27;s demands to know what is going on lead them to point out his hypocrisy in detail, poking fun at all his mythological affairs ().

Orphée&#x27;s arrival, with Public Opinion at his side, has the gods on their best behaviour (). Orphée obeys Public Opinion and pretends to be pining for Eurydice: he illustrates his supposed pain with a snatch of from Gluck&#x27;s . Pluton is worried he will be forced to give Eurydice back; Jupiter announces that he is going to the Underworld to sort everything out. The other gods beg to come with him, he consents, and mass celebrations break out at this holiday ().

====Act 2, Scene 1: Pluton&#x27;s boudoir in the Underworld====

Eurydice is being kept locked up by Pluton, and is finding life very tedious. Her gaoler is a dull-witted tippler by the name of John Styx. Before he died, he was King of Boeotia (a region of Greece that Aristophanes made synonymous with country bumpkins), and he sings Eurydice a doleful lament for his lost kingship ().

Jupiter discovers where Pluton has hidden Eurydice, and slips through the keyhole by turning into a beautiful, golden fly. He meets Eurydice on the other side, and sings a love duet with her where his part consists entirely of buzzing (). Afterwards, he reveals himself to her, and promises to help her, largely because he wants her for himself. Pluton is left furiously berating John Styx.

====Act 2, Scene 2: The banks of the Styx====
The scene shifts to a huge party the gods are having, where ambrosia, nectar, and propriety are nowhere to be seen (). Eurydice is present, disguised as a bacchante (), but Jupiter&#x27;s plan to sneak her out is interrupted by calls for a dance. Jupiter insists on a minuet, which everybody else finds boring (). Things liven up as the most famous number in the opera, the &quot;Galop infernal&quot;, begins, and all present throw themselves into it with wild abandon ().

Ominous violin music heralds the approach of Orphée (Entrance of Orphée and Public Opinion), but Jupiter has a plan, and promises to keep Eurydice away from her husband. As with the standard myth, Orphée must not look back, or he will lose Eurydice forever (). Public Opinion keeps a close eye on him, to keep him from cheating, but Jupiter throws a lightning bolt, making him jump and look back, and Eurydice vanishes. Amid the ensuing turmoil, Jupiter proclaims that she will henceforth belong to the god Bacchus and become one of his priestesses. Public Opinion is not pleased, but Pluton has had enough of Eurydice, Orphée is free of her, and all ends happily.

===Revised 1874 version===
The plot is essentially that of the 1858 version. Instead of two acts with two scenes apiece, the later version is in four acts, which follow the plot of the four scenes of the original. The revised version differs from the first in having several interpolated ballet sequences, and some extra characters and musical numbers. The additions do not affect the main narrative but add considerably to the length of the score. In Act I there is an opening chorus for assembled shepherds and shepherdesses, and Orpheus has a group of youthful violin students, who bid him farewell at the end of the act. In Act 2 Mercure is given a solo entrance number (). In Act 3, Eurydice has a new solo, the (), Cupidon has a new number, the (), the three judges of Hades and a little band of policemen are added to the cast to be involved in Jupiter&#x27;s search for the concealed Eurydice, and at the end of the act the furious Pluton is seized and carried off by a swarm of flies.

==Music==
The score of the opera, which formed the pattern for the many full-length Offenbach operas that followed, is described by Faris as having an &quot;abundance of couplets&quot; (songs with repeated verses for one or more singers), &quot;a variety of other solos and duets, several big choruses, and two extended finales&quot;. Offenbach wrote in a variety of styles – from Rococo pastoral vein, via pastiche of Italian opera, to the uproarious galop – displaying, in Faris&#x27;s analysis, many of his personal hallmarks, such as melodies that &quot;leap backwards and forwards in a remarkably acrobatic manner while still sounding not only smoothly lyrical, but spontaneous as well&quot;. In such up-tempo numbers as the &quot;Galop infernal&quot;, Offenbach makes a virtue of simplicity, often keeping to the same key through most of the number, with largely unvarying instrumentation throughout. Elsewhere in the score Offenbach gives the orchestra greater prominence. In the Jupiter&#x27;s part, consisting of buzzing like a fly, is accompanied by the first and second violins playing sul ponticello, to produce a similarly buzzing sound. In , Gustave Lafargue remarked that Offenbach&#x27;s use of a piccolo trill punctuated by a tap on a cymbal in the finale of the first scene was a modern recreation of an effect invented by Gluck in his score of . Wilfrid Mellers also remarks on Offenbach&#x27;s use of the piccolo to enhance Eurydice&#x27;s couplets with &quot;girlish giggles&quot; on the instrument. Gervase Hughes comments on the elaborate scoring of the [Act 3, 1874 version], and calls it &quot;a &quot;tour de force&quot;&quot; that could have inspired Tchaikovsky.
Faris comments that in Offenbach shows that he was a master of establishing mood by the use of rhythmic figures. Faris instances three numbers from the second act (1858 version), which all are in the key of A major and use identical notes in almost the same order, &quot;but it would be hard to imagine a more extreme difference in feeling than that between the song of the King of the Boeotians and the &quot;Galop&quot;&quot;. In a 2014 study Heather Hadlock comments that for the former, Offenbach composed &quot;a languid yet restless melody&quot; over a static musette-style drone-bass accompaniment of alternating dominant and tonic harmonies, simultaneously evoking and mocking nostalgia for a lost place and time and &quot;creating a perpetually unresolved tension between pathos and irony&quot;. Mellers finds that Styx&#x27;s aria has &quot;a pathos that touches the heart&quot; – perhaps, he suggests, the only instance of true feeling in the opera.

In 1999 Thomas Schipperges wrote in the &quot;International Journal of Musicology&quot; that many scholars hold that Offenbach&#x27;s music defies all musicological methods. He did not agree, and analysed the &quot;Galop infernal&quot;, finding it to be sophisticated in many details: &quot;For all its straightforwardness, it reveals a calculated design. The overall &#x27;economy&#x27; of the piece serves a deliberate musical dramaturgy.&quot; Hadlock observes that although the best-known music in the opera is &quot;driven by the propulsive energies of Rossinian comedy&quot; and the up-tempo galop, such lively numbers go side by side with statelier music in an 18th-century vein: &quot;The score&#x27;s sophistication results from Offenbach&#x27;s intertwining of contemporary urban musical language with a restrained and wistful tone that is undermined and ironized without ever being entirely undone&quot;.

 was the first of Offenbach&#x27;s major works to have a chorus. In a 2017 study Melissa Cummins comments that although the composer used the chorus extensively as Pluton&#x27;s minions, bored residents of Olympus, and bacchantes in Hades, they are merely there to fill out the vocal parts in the large ensemble numbers, and &quot;are treated as a nameless, faceless crowd who just happen to be around.&quot; In the Olympus scene the chorus has an unusual bocca chiusa section, marked &quot;Bouche fermée&quot;, an effect later used by Bizet in &quot;Djamileh&quot; and Puccini in the &quot;Humming Chorus&quot; in &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;.

===Editions===
The orchestra at the Bouffes-Parisiens was small – probably about thirty players. The 1858 version of is scored for two flutes (the second doubling piccolo), one oboe, two clarinets, one bassoon, two horns, two cornets, one trombone, timpani, percussion (bass drum/cymbals, triangle), and strings. The Offenbach scholar Jean-Christophe Keck speculates that the string sections consisted of at most six first violins, four second violins, three violas, four cellos, and one double bass. The 1874 score calls for considerably greater orchestral forces: Offenbach added additional parts for woodwind, brass and percussion sections. For the premiere of the revised version he engaged an orchestra of sixty players, as well as a military band of a further forty players for the procession of the gods from Olympus at the end of the second act.

The music of the 1874 revision was well received by contemporary reviewers, but some later critics have felt the longer score, with its extended ballet sections, has occasional dull patches. Nonetheless, some of the added numbers, particularly Cupidon&#x27;s , Mercure&#x27;s rondo , and the &quot;Policeman&#x27;s Chorus&quot; have gained favour, and some or all are often added to performances otherwise using the 1858 text.

For more than a century after the composer&#x27;s death one cause of critical reservations about this and his other works was the persistence of what the musicologist Nigel Simeone has called &quot;botched, butchered and bowdlerised&quot; versions. Since the beginning of the 21st century a project has been under way to release scholarly and reliable scores of Offenbach&#x27;s operas, under the editorship of Keck. The first to be published, in 2002, was the 1858 version of . The Offenbach Edition Keck has subsequently published the 1874 score, and another drawing on both the 1858 and 1874 versions.

===Overture and galop===

The best-known and much-recorded overture is not by Offenbach, and is not part of either the 1858 or the 1874 scores. It was arranged by the Austrian musician Carl Binder (1816–1860) for the first production of the opera in Vienna, in 1860. Offenbach&#x27;s 1858 score has a short orchestral introduction of 104 bars; it begins with a quiet melody for woodwind, followed by the theme of Jupiter&#x27;s Act 2 minuet, in A major and segues via a mock-pompous fugue in F major into Public Opinion&#x27;s opening monologue. The overture to the 1874 revision is a 393-bar piece, in which Jupiter&#x27;s minuet and John Styx&#x27;s song recur, interspersed with many themes from the score including , the couplets , the , the section of the Act 2 finale, and the Act 4 galop.

Fifteen years or so after Offenbach&#x27;s death the galop from Act 2 (or Act 4 in the 1874 version) became one of the world&#x27;s most famous pieces of music, when the Moulin Rouge and the Folies Bergère adopted it as the regular music for their can-can. Keck has commented that the original &quot;infernal galop&quot; was a considerably more spontaneous and riotous affair than the can-can (Keck likens the original to a modern rave) but the tune is now inseparable in the public mind from high-kicking female can-can dancers.

== Reception ==
===19th century===
From the outset divided critical opinion. Janin&#x27;s furious condemnation did the work much more good than harm, and was in contrast with the laudatory review of the premiere by Jules Noriac in the , which called the work, &quot;unprecedented, splendid, outrageous, gracious, delightful, witty, amusing, successful, perfect, tuneful&quot;. Bertrand Jouvin, in , criticised some of the cast but praised the staging – &quot;a fantasy show, which has all the variety, all the surprises of fairy-opera&quot;. The thought that though it would be wrong to expect too much in a piece of this genre, was one of Offenbach&#x27;s most outstanding works, with charming couplets for Eurydice, Aristée-Pluton and the King of Boeotia. called the cast &quot;thoroughbreds&quot; who did full justice to &quot;all the charming jokes, all the delicious originalities, all the farcical oddities thrown in profusion into Offenbach&#x27;s music&quot;.

Writing of the 1874 revised version, the authors of said, &quot; is above all a good show. The music of Offenbach has retained its youth and spirit. The amusing operetta of yore has become a splendid extravaganza&quot;, against which Félix Clément and Pierre Larousse wrote in their (1881) that the piece is &quot;a coarse and grotesque parody&quot; full of &quot;vulgar and indecent scenes&quot; that &quot;give off an unhealthy smell&quot;.

The opera was widely seen as containing thinly disguised satire of the régime of Napoleon III, but the early press criticisms of the work focused on its mockery of revered classical authors such as Ovid and the equally sacrosanct music of Gluck&#x27;s . Faris comments that the satire perpetrated by Offenbach and his librettists was cheeky rather than hard-hitting, and Richard Taruskin in his study of 19th-century music observes, &quot;The calculated licentiousness and feigned sacrilege, which successfully baited the stuffier critics, were recognized by all for what they were – a social palliative, the very opposite of social criticism[...] The spectacle of the Olympian gods doing the cancan threatened nobody&#x27;s dignity.&quot; The Emperor greatly enjoyed when he saw it at a command performance in 1860; he told Offenbach he would &quot;never forget that dazzling evening&quot;.

===20th and 21st centuries===
After Offenbach&#x27;s death his reputation in France suffered a temporary eclipse. In Faris&#x27;s words, his comic operas were &quot;dismissed as irrelevant and meretricious souvenirs of a discredited Empire&quot;. Obituarists in other countries similarly took it for granted that the comic operas, including , were ephemeral and would be forgotten. By the time of the composer&#x27;s centenary, in 1919, it had been clear for some years that such predictions had been wrong. was frequently revived, as were several more of his operas, and criticisms on moral or musical grounds had largely ceased. Gabriel Groviez wrote in &quot;The Musical Quarterly&quot;:

Among modern critics, Traubner describes as &quot;the first great full-length classical French operetta[...] classical (in both senses of the term)&quot;, although he regards the 1874 revision as &quot;overblown&quot;. Peter Gammond writes that the public appreciated the frivolity of the work while recognising that it is rooted in the best traditions of opéra comique. Among 21st-century writers Bernard Holland has commented that the music is &quot;beautifully made, relentlessly cheerful, reluctantly serious&quot;, but does not show as the later &quot;Tales of Hoffmann&quot; does &quot;what a profoundly gifted composer Offenbach really was&quot;; Andrew Lamb has commented that although has remained Offenbach&#x27;s best-known work, &quot;a consensus as to the best of his operettas would probably prefer for its sparkle, for its charm and for its all-round brilliance&quot;. Kurt Gänzl writes in &quot;The Encyclopedia of the Musical Theatre&quot; that compared with earlier efforts, was &quot;something on a different scale[...] a gloriously imaginative parody of classic mythology and of modern events decorated with Offenbach&#x27;s most laughing bouffe music.&quot; In a 2014 study of parody and burlesque in , Hadlock writes:

==Revivals==
===France===
Between the first run and the first Paris revival, in 1860, the Bouffes-Parisiens company toured the French provinces, where was reported as meeting with &quot;immense&quot; and &quot;incredible&quot; success&quot;. Tautin was succeeded as Eurydice by Delphine Ugalde when the production was revived at the Bouffes-Parisiens in 1862 and again in 1867.

The first revival of the 1874 version was at the Théâtre de la Gaîté in 1875 with Marie Blanche Peschard as Eurydice. It was revived again there in January 1878 with Meyronnet (Orphée), Peschard (Eurydice), Christian (Jupiter), Habay (Pluton) and Pierre Grivot as both Mercure and John Styx, For the Exposition Universelle season later that year Offenbach revived the piece again, with Grivot as Orphée, Peschard as Eurydice, the composer&#x27;s old friend and rival Hervé as Jupiter and Léonce as Pluton. The opera was seen again at the Gaîté in 1887 with Taufenberger (Orphée), Jeanne Granier (Eurydice), Eugène Vauthier (Jupiter) and Alexandre (Pluton). There was a revival at the Éden-Théâtre (1889) with Minart, Granier, Christian and Alexandre.

20th-century revivals in Paris included productions at the Théâtre des Variétés (1902) with Charles Prince (Orphée), Juliette Méaly (Eurydice), Guy (Jupiter) and Albert Brasseur (Pluton), and in 1912 with Paul Bourillon, Méaly, Guy and Prince; the Théâtre Mogador (1931) with Adrien Lamy, Manse Beaujon, Max Dearly and Lucien Muratore; the Opéra-Comique (1970) with Rémy Corazza, Anne-Marie Sanial, Michel Roux and Robert Andreozzi; the Théâtre de la Gaïté-Lyrique (1972) with Jean Giraudeau, Jean Brun, Albert Voli and Sanial; and by the Théâtre français de l&#x27;Opérette at the Espace Cardin (1984) with multiple casts including (in alphabetical order) André Dran, Maarten Koningsberger, Martine March, Martine Masquelin, Marcel Quillevere, Ghyslaine Raphanel, Bernard Sinclair and Michel Trempont. In January 1988 the work received its first performances at the Paris Opéra, with Michel Sénéchal (Orphée), Danielle Borst (Eurydice), François Le Roux (Jupiter), and Laurence Dale (Pluton).

In December 1997 a production by Laurent Pelly was seen at the Opéra National de Lyon, where it was filmed for DVD, with Yann Beuron (Orphée), Natalie Dessay (Eurydice), Laurent Naouri (Jupiter) and Jean-Paul Fouchécourt (Pluton) with Marc Minkowski conducting. The production originated in Geneva, where it had been given in September – in a former hydroelectric plant used while the stage area of the Grand Théâtre was being renovated – by a cast headed by Beuron, Annick Massis, Naouri, and Éric Huchet.

===Continental Europe===
The first production outside France is believed to have been at Breslau in October 1859. In December of the same year the opera opened in Prague. The work was given in German at the Carltheater, Vienna, in March 1860 in a version by Ludwig Kalisch, revised and embellished by Johann Nestroy, who played Jupiter. Making fun of Graeco-Roman mythology had a long tradition in the popular theatre of Vienna, and audiences had no difficulty with the disrespect that had outraged Jules Janin and others in Paris. It was for this production that Carl Binder put together the version of the overture that is now the best known. There were revivals at the same theatre in February and June 1861 (both given in French) and at the Theater an der Wien in January 1867. 1860 saw the work&#x27;s local premieres in Brussels, Stockholm, Copenhagen and Berlin. Productions followed in Warsaw, St Petersburg, and Budapest, and then Zurich, Madrid, Amsterdam, Milan and Naples.

Gänzl mentions among &quot;countless other productions[...] a large and glitzy German revival under Max Reinhardt&quot; at the Großes Schauspielhaus, Berlin in 1922. A more recent Berlin production was directed by Götz Friedrich in 1983; a video of the production was released. 2019 productions include those directed by Helmut Baumann at the Vienna Volksoper, and by Barrie Kosky at the Haus für Mozart, Salzburg, with a cast headed by Anne Sophie von Otter as L&#x27;Opinion publique, a co-production between the Salzburg Festival, Komische Oper Berlin and Deutsche Oper am Rhein.

===Britain===

The first London production of the work was at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in December 1865, in an English version by J. R. Planché titled &quot;Orpheus in the Haymarket&quot;. There were West End productions in the original French in 1869 and 1870 by companies headed by Hortense Schneider. English versions followed by Alfred Thompson (1876) and Henry S. Leigh (1877). An adaptation by Herbert Beerbohm Tree and Alfred Noyes opened at His Majesty&#x27;s in 1911. The opera was not seen again in London until 1960, when a new adaptation by Geoffrey Dunn opened at Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre; this production by Wendy Toye was frequently revived between 1960 and 1974. An English version by Snoo Wilson for English National Opera (ENO), mounted at the London Coliseum in 1985, was revived there in 1987. A co-production by Opera North and the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company in a version by Jeremy Sams opened in 1992 and was revived several times. In 2019 ENO presented a new production directed by Emma Rice, which opened to unfavourable reviews.

===Outside Europe===
The first New York production was at the Stadt Theater, in German, in March 1861; the production ran until February 1862. Two more productions were sung in German: December 1863 with Fritze, Knorr, Klein and Frin von Hedemann and December 1866 with Brügmann, Knorr, Klein and Frin Steglich-Fuchs. The opera was produced at the Theatre Français in January 1867 with Elvira Naddie, and at the Fifth Avenue Theatre in April 1868 with Lucille Tostée. In December 1883 it was produced at the Bijou Theatre with Max Freeman, Marie Vanoni, Digby Bell and Harry Pepper. There were productions in Rio de Janeiro in 1865, Buenos Aires in 1866, Mexico City in 1867 and Valparaiso in 1868. The opera was first staged in Australia at the Princess Theatre, Melbourne in March 1872, in Planché&#x27;s London text, with Alice May as Eurydice.

A spectacular production by Reinhardt was presented in New York in 1926. The New York City Opera staged the work, conducted by Erich Leinsdorf, in 1956, with Sylvia Stahlman as Eurydice and Norman Kelley as Pluto. More recent US productions have included a 1985 version by Santa Fe Opera, and the 1985 ENO version, which was staged in the US by the Houston Grand Opera (co-producers) in 1986, and Los Angeles Opera in 1989.

===21st century worldwide===
In April 2019 the Operabase website recorded 25 past or scheduled productions of the opera from 2016 onwards, in French or in translation: nine in Germany, four in France, two in Britain, two in Switzerland, two in the US, and productions in Gdańsk, Liège, Ljubljana, Malmö, Prague and Tokyo.

<text>Hagbard Celine is a central protagonist in &quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot; series of books by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson named after the legendary Viking hero; Hagbard who died for love. In the &quot;Schrödinger&#x27;s Cat Trilogy&quot; written after &quot;Illuminatus!&quot;, it is stated that &quot;Hagbard Celine&quot; is a pseudonym and that his legal name is Howard Crane. However, the trilogy passes through many different universes.

==Character==
Hagbard has parallels to Jules Verne&#x27;s character, Captain Nemo. Both are genius captains aboard a fantastic submarine. Both are rogues who have mostly broken off from society, yet help the oppressed. Some have even theorized that Hagbard Celine is Captain Nemo, though Verne&#x27;s &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot; is set in the second half of the nineteenth century. He is also comparable to a degree to Ragnar Danneskjold, a libertarian pirate in Ayn Rand&#x27;s novel &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;, which is spoofed in the chronicles as &quot;Telemachus Sneezed&quot;. Like Danneskjold, Hagbard participates in the black market, exploiting and resisting governments, and both characters have Norwegian roots.

Hagbard is a notorious prankster and liar (telling one character not to trust anyone with the initials H.C.). This character trait is displayed throughout &quot;Illuminatus!&quot;. Celine tends to give misinformation about himself and his intentions and that he faked the death of an actress, implied to be Marilyn Monroe, in order to train her into becoming an embodiment of the goddess Eris. Celine subsequently fell in love with the woman and announces his intention to marry her during the trilogy.

A Discordian anarchist, he fights the Illuminati from a golden submarine, the &quot;Leif Ericson&quot; (named after the Viking explorer). The submarine was supposedly designed and built by himself, stolen from the United States Navy, or a gift from the Mafia. Despite its size—the equivalent of five city blocks long with a three-story-high conning tower—it has so far remained undetected.

He has a Norwegian mother and a Sicilian father, physically resembling Anthony Quinn. In a section printed in the introductions of volumes I and II of the trilogy, though not reprinted in the single-volume compilation, the narrator mentions that he has a raft of Irish relatives in Ohio named McGee and Marlowe. Wilson also implies in &quot;The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles&quot; that Hagbard is related to one of the central characters, Sigismundo Celine.

He speaks Norwegian, Italian, English, German, Latin, Greek and Swahili. He graduated from Harvard with a somewhat strange double major in contract law and naval engineering.

A former naturalized United States citizen, Hagbard supposedly relinquished his citizenship after representing a Mohawk reservation in court against the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Hagbard generally told people he was an engineer building a dam during his time with the Mohawk because he was ashamed of being a lawyer.

He later became a citizen of Equatorial Guinea, of which Fernando Poo is a part, having papers referring to this by the time of the Walpurgisnacht rock concert. The appendix to the trilogy mentions that Hagbard builds a starship and leaves to explore Alpha Centauri in the year 1999.

Hagbard designed a supercomputer called the First Universal Cybernetic Kinetic Ultramicro-Programmer. Among other things, he used to calculate the chances of World War III starting, which it does by throwing virtual I Ching sticks.

His manifesto is called &quot;Never Whistle While You&#x27;re Pissing&quot;, containing his &quot;Definitions and Distinctions&quot;, an anarchist interpretation of capitalist concepts.

<text>52 Europa is the sixth largest asteroid in the asteroid belt, having a diameter of over 300 km, though it is not correspondingly massive. It is not round but is shaped like an ellipsoid of approximately 380×330×250 km. It was discovered on 4 February 1858, by Hermann Goldschmidt from his balcony in Paris. It is named after Europa, one of Zeus&#x27;s conquests in Greek mythology, a name it shares with Jupiter&#x27;s moon Europa.

==Physical characteristics==

Europa is approximately the sixth largest asteroid by volume. Most likely it has a density of around 1.5 g/cm3, typical of C-type asteroids. In 2007, James Baer and Steven R. Chesley estimated Europa to have a mass of  kg. A more recent estimate by Baer suggests it has a mass of 3.27 kg.

Europa is a very dark carbonaceous C-type, and is the second largest of this group. Spectroscopic studies have found evidence of olivines and pyroxenes on the surface, and there is some indication that there may be compositional differences between different regions. It orbits close to the Hygiea asteroid family, but is not a member.

Lightcurve data for Europa have been particularly tricky to interpret, so much so that for a long time its period of rotation was in dispute (ranging from hours to 11 hours), despite numerous observations. It has now been determined that Europa is a prograde rotator, but the exact direction in which its pole points remains ambiguous. The most detailed analysis indicates that it points either towards about ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (70°, 55°) or (40°, 255°) with a 10° uncertainty. This gives an axial tilt of about 14° or 54°, respectively.

In 1988 a search for satellites or dust orbiting this asteroid was performed using the UH88 telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatories, but the effort came up empty.

==Observations==
It has been found that the reputed cataclysmic variable star CV Aquarii, discovered in 1934, was actually a misidentification of 52 Europa.

<doc id="47210" wikidata="Q178710" url="?curid=47210" title="Vesta (mythology)">
<text>Vesta () is the virgin goddess of the hearth, home, and family in Roman religion. She was rarely depicted in human form, and was more often represented by the fire of her temple in the Forum Romanum. Entry to her temple was permitted only to her priestesses, the Vestal Virgins. Their virginity was deemed essential to Rome&#x27;s survival; if found guilty of inchastity, they were buried or entombed alive. As Vesta was considered a guardian of the Roman people, her festival, the &quot;Vestalia&quot; (7–15 June), was regarded as one of the most important Roman holidays. During the &quot;Vestalia&quot; privileged matrons walked barefoot through the city to the temple, where they presented food-offerings. Such was Vesta&#x27;s importance to Roman religion that following the rise of Christianity, hers was one of the last non-Christian cults still active, until it was forcibly disbanded by the Christian emperor Theodosius I in AD 391.

The myths depicting Vesta and her priestesses were few; the most notable of them were tales of miraculous impregnation of a virgin priestess by a phallus appearing in the flames of the sacred hearth — the manifestation of the goddess combined with a male supernatural being. In some Roman traditions, Rome&#x27;s founders Romulus and Remus and the benevolent king Servius Tullius were conceived in this way. Vesta was among the &quot;Dii Consentes&quot;, twelve of the most honored gods in the Roman pantheon. She was the daughter of Saturn and Ops, and sister of Jupiter, Neptune, Pluto, Juno, and Ceres. Her Greek equivalent is Hestia.

==Etymology==

Ovid derived Vesta from Latin – &quot;standing by power&quot;. Cicero supposed that the Latin name &quot;Vesta&quot; derives from its Greek counterpart, &quot;Hestia&quot;, which Cornutus claimed to have derived from Greek (&quot;standing for ever&quot;). This etymology is offered by Servius as well. Another proposed etymology is that Vesta derives from Latin (&quot;clothe&quot;), as well as from Greek (&quot;hestia&quot;, &quot;hearth&quot; = &quot;focus urbis&quot;). None, except perhaps the last, are probable.

Georges Dumézil (1898–1986), a French comparative philologist, surmised that the name of the goddess derives from Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*h₁eu-&quot;, via the derivative form &quot;*h₁eu-s-&quot; which alternates with &quot;*h₁w-es-&quot;. The former is found in Greek , Latin , and Vedic &quot;osathi&quot; all conveying &#x27;burning&#x27; and the second is found in &quot;Vesta&quot;. (Beekes considers the Greek goddess-name Ἑστία &quot;Hestia&quot; is probably unrelated.) See also Gallic Celtic &quot;visc&quot; &quot;fire.&quot;

Poultney suggests that Vesta may be related to the Umbrian god &quot;Uestisier&quot; (gen.)/&quot;Vestiçe&quot; (dat.) (as if Latin *Vesticius), itself related to Umbrian terms for &#x27;libation&#x27; &quot;uestisiar&quot; (gen.sg.), &#x27;pour a libation&#x27; &quot;uesticatu&quot; (imv.) from *&quot;westikia&quot; and *&quot;westikato:d&quot; respectively. Perhaps also related to Oscan &quot;Veskeí&quot; from the Oscan Tablet also known as the Agnone Dedication.

==History==
===Origin===
According to tradition, worship of Vesta in Italy began in Lavinium, the mother-city of Alba Longa and the first settlement by the Trojan refugees after their flight from Troy&#x27;s destruction, led there by Aeneas and guided by Venus. It was believed that from Lavinium, the worship of Vesta was transferred to Alba Longa, a belief evident in the custom of Roman magistrates going to Lavinium, when appointed to higher office, and offering sacrifice both to Vesta and the household gods of the Roman state known as Penates, whose images were kept in Vesta&#x27;s temple. Alongside those household gods was Vesta, whom the Roman poet refers to as &quot;Vesta Iliaca&quot; (&quot;Vesta of Ilium/Troy&quot;). Vesta&#x27;s sacred hearth was also named &quot;Iliaci foci&quot; (&quot;hearth of Ilium/Troy&quot;).

Worship of Vesta, like the worship of many gods, originated in the home, but in Roman historical tradition, it became an established cult of state during the reign of either Romulus, or Numa Pompilius (sources disagree, but most say Numa). The priestesses of Vesta, known as Vestal Virgins, administered her temple and sustained its sacred fire. The existence of Vestal Virgins in Alba Longa is connected with early Roman traditions, for the mother of Romulus&#x27; and Remus, Silvia, was a priestess of Vesta, impregnated by either Mars or Hercules.

===Roman Empire===
Roman tradition required that the leading priest of the Roman state, the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; reside in a &quot;domus publicus&quot; (&quot;publicly owned house&quot;). After assuming the office of &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; in 12 BC, Augustus gave part of his private house to the Vestals as public property and incorporated a new shrine of Vesta within it. The old shrine remained in the &quot;Forum Romanum&quot;&#x27;s temple of Vesta, but Augustus&#x27; gift linked the public hearth of the state with the official home of the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; and the emperor&#x27;s Palatine residence. This strengthened the connection between the office of &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; and the cult of Vesta. Henceforth, the office of &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; was tied to the title of emperor; Emperors were automatically priests of Vesta, and the &quot;pontifices&quot; were sometimes referred to as &quot;pontifices Vestae&quot; (&quot;priests of Vesta&quot;). In 12 BC, 28 April (first of the five day &quot;Floralia&quot;) was chosen &quot;ex senatus consultum&quot; to commemorate the new shrine of Vesta in Augustus&#x27; home on the Palatine. The latter&#x27;s hearth was the focus of the Imperial household&#x27;s traditional religious observances. Various emperors led official revivals and promotions of the Vestals&#x27; cult, which in its various locations remained central to Rome&#x27;s ancient traditional cults into the 4th century. Dedications in the Atrium of Vesta, dating predominantly AD 200 to 300, attest to the service of several &quot;Virgines Vestales Maxime&quot;. Vesta&#x27;s worship began to decline with the rise of Christianity. In ca. 379, Gratian stepped down as &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;; in 382 he confiscated the &quot;Atrium Vestae&quot; and simultaneously withdrew its public funding. In 391, despite official and public protests, Theodosius I closed the temple, and extinguished the sacred flame. Finally, Coelia Concordia stepped down as the last &quot;Vestalis Maxima&quot; (&quot;chief Vestal&quot;) in 394.

==Depictions==

Depicted as a good-mannered deity who never involved herself in the quarreling of other gods, Vesta was ambiguous at times due to her contradictory association with the phallus. She is considered the embodiment of the &quot;Phallic Mother&quot; by proponents of 20th Century psychoanalysis: she was not only the most virgin and clean of all the gods, but was addressed as mother and granted fertility. Mythographers tell us that Vesta had no myths save being identified as one of the oldest of the gods who was entitled to preference in veneration and offerings over all other gods. Unlike most gods, Vesta was hardly depicted directly; nonetheless, she was symbolized by her flame, the fire stick, and a ritual phallus (the &quot;fascinus&quot;).

While Vesta was the flame itself, the symbol of the phallus might relate to Vesta&#x27;s function in fertility cults, but it maybe also invoked the goddess herself due to its relation to the fire stick used to light the sacred flame. She was sometimes thought of as a personification of the fire stick which was inserted into a hollow piece of wood and rotated – in a phallic manner – to light her flame.

===Hearth===
Concerning the status of Vesta&#x27;s hearth, Dionysius of Halicarnassus had this to say: &quot;And they regard the fire as consecrated to Vesta, because that goddess, being the Earth and occupying the central position in the universe, kindles the celestial fires from herself.&quot; Ovid agreed, saying: &quot;Vesta is the same as the earth; both have the perennial fire: the Earth and the sacred Fire are both symbolic of home.&quot; The sacred flames of the hearth were believed to be indispensable for the preservation and continuity of the Roman State: Cicero states it explicitly. The purity of the flames symbolised the vital force that is the root of the life of the community. It was also because the virgins&#x27; ritual concern extended to the agricultural cycle and ensured a good harvest that Vesta enjoyed the title of &quot;Mater&quot; (&quot;Mother&quot;).

The fecundating power of sacred fire is testified to in Plutarch&#x27;s version of the birth of Romulus and Remus, in the birth of king Servius Tullius, whose mother Ocresia becomes pregnant after sitting upon a phallus that appeared among the ashes of the ara of the god Vulcanus by order of Tanaquil wife of king Tarquinius Priscus, and in the birth of Caeculus, the founder of Praeneste, who had the power to kindle or extinguish fires at will. All these mythical or semi-legendary characters show a mystical mastery of fire. Servius&#x27;s hair was kindled by his father without hurting him, and even his statue in the temple of Fortuna Primigenia was unharmed by fire after his assassination.

===Marriage===

Vesta was connected to liminality, and the &quot;limen&quot; (&quot;threshold&quot;) was sacred to her: brides were careful not to step on it, else they commit sacrilege by kicking a sacred object. Servius explains that it would be poor judgement for a virgin bride to kick an object sacred to Vesta, a goddess who holds chastity sacred. On the other hand, it might merely have been because Romans considered it bad luck to trample any object sacred to the gods. In Plautus&#x27; &quot;Casina&quot;, the bride Casina is cautioned to lift her feet carefully over the threshold following her wedding so she would have the upper hand in her marriage. Likewise, Catullus cautions a bride to keep her feet over the threshold &quot;with a good omen&quot;. It is possible that the concern that brides not touch the threshold (&quot;limen&quot;) with their feet may be the source of the tradition of a husband carrying his new bride across the threshold when entering their new home following their marriage.

In Roman belief, Vesta was present in all weddings, and so was Janus: Vesta was the threshold and Janus the doorway. Similarly, Vesta and Janus were invoked in every sacrifice. It has been noted that because they were invoked so often, the evocation of the two came to simply mean, &quot;to pray&quot;. In addition, Vesta was present with Janus in all sacrifices as well. It has also been noted that neither of them were consistently illustrated as human. This has been suggested as evidence of their ancient Italic origin, because neither of them was &quot;fully anthropomorphized&quot;

===Agriculture===
Counted among the agricultural deities, Vesta has been linked to the deities Tellus and Terra in separate accounts. In &quot;Antiquitates rerum humanarum et divinarum&quot;, Varro links Vesta to Tellus. He says: &quot;They think Tellus... is Vesta, because she is &#x27;vested&#x27; in flowers&quot;. Verrius Flaccus, however, had identified Vesta with Terra. Ovid hints at Vesta&#x27;s connection to both of the deities.

==Temple==
Where the majority of temples would have a statue, that of Vesta had a hearth. The fire was a religious center of Roman worship, the common hearth (&quot;focus publicus&quot;) of the whole Roman people. The Vestals were obliged to keep the sacred fire alight. If the fire went out, it must be lit from an &quot;arbor felix&quot; (&quot;auspicious tree&quot;, probably an oak). Water was not allowed into the inner &quot;aedes&quot; nor could it remain longer than strictly necessary in or on the nearby premises. It was carried by the Vestales in vessels called &quot;futiles&quot; which had a tiny foot that made them unstable.

The temple of Vesta held not only the &quot;ignes aeternum&quot; (&quot;sacred fire&quot;), but the Palladium of Pallas Athena and the &quot;di Penates&quot; as well. Both of these items are said to have been brought into Italy by Aeneas. The Palladium of Athena was, in the words of Livy: &quot;fatale pignus imperii Romani&quot; (&quot;[a] pledge of destiny for the Roman empire&quot;). Such was the Palladium&#x27;s importance that when the Gauls sacked Rome in 390 BC, the Vestals first buried the Palladium before removing themselves to the safety of nearby Caere. Such objects were kept in the &quot;penus Vestae&quot; (i.e., the sacred repository of the temple of Vesta).

Despite being one of the most spiritual of Roman Shrines, that of Vesta was not a &quot;templum&quot; in the Roman sense of the word; that is, it was not a building consecrated by the augurs and so it could not be used for meetings by Roman officials. It has also been claimed that the shrine of Vesta in Rome was not a &quot;templum&quot; because of its round shape. However, a &quot;templum&quot; was not a building, but rather a sacred space that could contain a building of either rectangular or circular shape. In fact, early &quot;templa&quot; were often altars that were consecrated and later had buildings erected around them. The temple of Vesta in Rome was an &quot;aedes&quot; and not a &quot;templum&quot; most likely because of the character of the cult of Vesta, the exact reason being unknown.

==Vestal Virgins==
The Vestales were one of the few full-time clergy positions in Roman religion. They were drawn from the patrician class and were required to swear an oath of absolute chastity for 30 years. It was because of this requirement that the Vestales were named the Vestal virgins. They wore a particular style of dress and were not allowed to let the fire go out on pain of a whipping. On becoming a priestess, a Vestal Virgin was legally emancipated from her father&#x27;s authority. The Vestal Virgins lived together in a house near the Forum (&quot;Atrium Vestae&quot;), supervised by the Pontifex Maximus. A Vestal who broke her vow of chastity could be tried for incestum and if found guilty, buried alive in the &quot;Campus Sceleris&quot; (&#x27;Field of Wickedness&#x27;).

The (&quot;lanas&quot;: woolen threads) that were an essential part of the Vestal costume were supplied by the rex sacrorum and flamen dialis. Once a year, the Vestals gave the &quot;rex sacrorum&quot; a ritualised warning to be vigilant in his duties, using the phrase &quot;Vigilasne rex, vigila!&quot; In Cicero&#x27;s opinion, the Vestals ensured that Rome kept its contact with the gods.

A peculiar duty of the Vestals was the preparation and conservation of the sacred salamoia muries used for the savouring of the &quot;mola salsa&quot;, a salted flour mixture to be sprinkled on sacrificial victims (hence the Latin verb &quot;immolare&quot;, &quot;to put on the &quot;mola&quot;, to sacrifice&quot;). This dough too was prepared by them on fixed days. Theirs also the task of preparing the suffimen for the Parilia.

==Festivals==
Domestic and family life in general were represented by the festival of the goddess of the house and of the spirits of the storechamber – Vesta and the Penates – on &quot;Vestalia&quot; (7 – 15 June). On the first day of festivities the &quot;penus Vestae&quot; (&quot;sanctum sanctorum&quot; of her temple which was usually curtained off) was opened, for the only time during the year, at which women offered sacrifices. As long as the curtain remained open, mothers could come, barefoot and disheveled, to leave offerings to the goddess in exchange for a blessing to them and their family. The animal consecrated to Vesta, the donkey, was crowned with garlands of flowers and bits of bread on 9 June. The final day (15 June) was [&quot;when dung may be removed lawfully&quot;] – the &quot;penus Vestae&quot; was solemnly closed; the &quot;Flaminica Dialis&quot; observed mourning, and the temple was subjected to a purification called &quot;stercoratio&quot;: the filth was swept from the temple and carried next by the route called &quot;clivus Capitolinus&quot; and then into the Tiber.

In the military &quot;Feriale Duranum&quot; (AD 224) the first day of &quot;Vestalia&quot; is &quot;Vesta &quot; and the last day is &quot;Vesta cluditur&quot;. This year records a &quot;supplicatio&quot; dedicated to Vesta for 9 June, and records of the Arval Brethren on this day observe a blood sacrifice to her as well. Found in the Codex-Calendar of 354, 13 February had become the holiday &quot;Virgo Vestalis parentat&quot;, a public holiday which by then had replaced the older &quot;parentalia&quot; where the sacrifice of cattle over flames is now dedicated to Vesta. This also marks the first participation of the Vestal Virgins in rites associated with the Manes.

==Mythography==

Vesta had no official mythology, and she existed as an abstract goddess of the hearth and of chastity. Only in the account of Ovid at Cybele&#x27;s party does Vesta appear directly in a myth.

===Birth of Romulus and Remus===

Plutarch, in his &quot;Life of Romulus&quot;, told a variation of Romulus&#x27; birth citing a compilation of Italian history by a Promathion. In this version, while Tarchetius was king of Alba Longa, a phantom phallus appeared in his hearth. The king visited an oracle of Tethys in Etrusca, who told him that a virgin must have intercourse with this phallus. Tarchetius instructed one of his daughters to do so, but she refused sending a handmaiden in her place. Angered, the king contemplated her execution; however, Vesta appeared to him in his sleep and forbade it. When the handmaid gave birth to twins by the phantom, Tarchetius handed them over to his subordinate, Teratius, with orders to destroy them. Teratius instead carried them to the shore of the river Tiber and laid them there. Then a she-wolf came to them and breastfed them, birds brought them food and fed them, before an amazed cow-herder came and took the children home with him. Thus they were saved, and when they were grown up, they set upon Tarchetius and overcame him. Plutarch concludes with a contrast between Promathion&#x27;s version of Romulus&#x27; birth and that of the more credible Fabius Pictor which he describes in a detailed narrative and lends support to.

===Conception of Servius Tullius===
Dionysius of Halicarnassus recounts a local story regarding the birth of king Servius Tullius. In it, a phallus rose from the hearth of Vesta in Numa&#x27;s palace, and Ocresia was the first to see it. She immediately informed the king and queen. King Tarquinius, upon hearing this, was astonished; but Tanaquil, whose knowledge of divination was well-known, told him it was a blessing that a birth by the hearth&#x27;s phallus and a mortal woman would produce superior offspring. The king then chose Ocresia to have intercourse with it, for she had seen it first. During which either Vulcan, or the tutelary deity of the house, appeared to her. After disappearing, she conceived and delivered Tullius. This story of his birth could be based on his name as Servius would euphemistically mean &quot;son of servant&quot;, because his mother was a handmaiden.

===Impropriety of Priapus===
In book 6 of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Fasti&quot;: Cybele invited all the gods, satyrs, rural divinities, and nymphs to a feast, though Silenus came uninvited with his donkey. At some point during the feast, Vesta lay at rest, and Priapus spotted her. As he approached her in order to violate her, the ass brought by Silenus let out a timely bray, whereupon Vesta awoke and Priapus barely escaped the outraged gods. Mentioned in book 1 of the &quot;Fasti&quot; is a similar instance of Priapus&#x27; impropriety involving Lotis and Priapus. The Vesta-Priapus account is not as well developed as that involving Lotis, and critics suggest the account of Vesta and Priapus only exists to create a cult drama. Ovid says the donkey was adorned with necklaces of bread-bits in memory of the event. Elsewhere, he says donkeys were honored on 9 June during the &quot;Vestalia&quot; in thanks for the services they provided in the bakeries.

==Vesta outside Rome==
Vesta&#x27;s cult is attested at Bovillae, Lavinium and Tibur. The Alban Vestals at Bovillae (Albanae Longanae Bovillenses) were supposedly a continuation of the original Alban Vestals, and Lavinium had the Vestals of the Laurentes Lavinates, both orders rooted in ancient traditions that were thought to predate Rome&#x27;s foundation. In a later period, Tibur&#x27;s vestals are attested epigraphically. Vestals might have been present at the sanctuary of Diana Nemorensis near Aricia.

<text>4769 Castalia (; &quot;prov. designation:&quot; ) is a near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid of the Apollo group, approximately in diameter and was the first asteroid to be modeled by radar imaging. It was discovered on 9 August 1989, by American astronomer Eleanor Helin (Caltech) on photographic plates taken at Palomar Observatory in California. It is named after Castalia, a nymph in Greek mythology. It is also a Mars- and Venus-crosser asteroid.

==General information==

On 25 August 1989 Castalia passed (within eleven lunar distances) of Earth, allowing it to be observed with radar from the Arecibo Observatory by Scott Hudson (Washington State University) and Steven J. Ostro (JPL). The data allowed Hudson et al. to produce a three-dimensional model of the object. During the 1989 passage Castalia peaked at an apparent magnitude of 12.

Castalia has a peanut shape, suggesting two approximately 800-meter-diameter pieces held together by their weak mutual gravity. Since then radar observations of other asteroids have found other contact binaries.

Castalia is a potentially hazardous asteroid (PHA) because its minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) is less than 0.05 AU and its diameter is greater than 150 meters. The Earth-MOID is . Its orbit is well-determined for the next several hundred years.

=== Byzantine Empire ===
* Arab–Byzantine War: Emperor Nikephoros II continues the reconquest of south-eastern Anatolia (modern Turkey). He recaptures Cyprus, and reorganizes the conquered lands into new themes. In the summer, they take the fortress cities of Anazarbus and Adana. Byzantine troops under General John Tzimiskes besiege Mopsuestia, but with the coming of winter he is forced to retreat to Caesarea. 
* October 24–25 – Siege of Rometta: Nikephoros II sends an expedition to Sicily. The Byzantine army (40,000 men) is sent to break the Muslim siege at Rometta, and to regain Sicily for the Byzantine Empire. For two days a battle takes place in the area between the beach and the besieged citadel of Rometta. The Saracens (under Al-Hasan ibn Ammar) manage to defeat the Byzantine relief force.

=== Europe ===
* Spring – King Adalbert II returns to the mainland of Italy, and occupies the environs of Spoleto. Emperor Otto I (&#x27;the Great&#x27;) leaves Rome with his army, and lays siege to the fortress city of Spoleto.
* Otto I proceeds on campaign in Italy, remaining in the environs of Lucca. In the fall he leaves plague-wracked Tuscany, and is forced to retreat to Liguria. His rearguard is attacked by Adalbert II.

<doc id="47219" wikidata="Q165170" url="?curid=47219" title="Europa (consort of Zeus)">
<text>In Greek mythology, Europa (; , &quot;Eurṓpē&quot;, ) was a Phoenician princess from Tyre and the mother of King Minos of Crete. The continent of Europe is named after her. The story of her abduction by Zeus in the form of a bull was a Cretan story; as classicist Károly Kerényi points out, &quot;most of the love-stories concerning Zeus originated from more ancient tales describing his marriages with goddesses. This can especially be said of the story of Europa.&quot;

Europa&#x27;s earliest literary reference is in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, which is commonly dated to the 8th century BC. Another early reference to her is in a fragment of the Hesiodic &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot;, discovered at Oxyrhynchus. The earliest vase-painting securely identifiable as Europa dates from the mid-7th century BC.

==Etymology==

Greek (&quot;Eurṓpē&quot;) may have been formed from εὐρύς (&quot;eurus&quot;), &quot;wide, broad&quot; and ὤψ/ὠπ-/ὀπτ- (&quot;ōps&quot;/&quot;ōp&quot;-/&quot;opt-&quot;) &quot;eye, face, countenance&quot;. &quot;Broad&quot; has been an epithet of Earth herself in the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European religion. 

It is common in ancient Greek mythology and geography to identify lands or rivers with female figures. Thus, &quot;Europa&quot; is first used in a geographic context in the Homeric Hymn to Delian Apollo, in reference to the western shore of the Aegean Sea.
As a name for a part of the known world, it is first used in the 6th century BC by Anaximander and Hecataeus. Toponyms related to that of Europa exist in the territory of ancient Greece, such as that of Europos in ancient Macedonia, as collected by Robert Beekes.

An alternative suggestion due to Ernest Klein and Giovanni Semerano (1966) attempted to connect a Semitic term for &quot;west&quot;, Akkadian &quot;erebu&quot; meaning &quot;to go down, set&quot; (in reference to the sun), Phoenician &quot; &#x27;ereb&quot; &quot;evening; west&quot;, which would parallel &quot;occident&quot; (the resemblance to &quot;Erebus&quot;, from PIE &quot;*h1regʷos&quot;, &quot;darkness&quot;, is accidental, however). Barry (1999) adduces the word &quot;Ereb&quot; on an Assyrian stele with the meaning of &quot;night&quot;, &quot;[the country of] sunset&quot;, in opposition to &quot;Asu&quot; &quot;[the country of] sunrise&quot;, i.e. Asia (Anatolia coming equally from Ἀνατολή, &quot;(sun)rise&quot;, &quot;east&quot;). This proposal is mostly considered unlikely or untenable.

==Family==
Sources differ in details regarding Europa&#x27;s family, but agree that she is Phoenician, and from an Argive lineage that ultimately descended from the princess Io, the mythical nymph beloved of Zeus, who was transformed into a heifer. She is generally said to be the daughter of Agenor, the Phoenician King of Tyre; the Syracusan poet Moschus makes her mother Queen Telephassa (&quot;far-shining&quot;) but elsewhere her mother is Argiope (&quot;silver-faced&quot;). Other sources, such as the &quot;Iliad&quot;, claim that she is the daughter of Agenor&#x27;s son, the &quot;sun-red&quot; Phoenix. It is generally agreed that she had two brothers, Cadmus, who brought the alphabet to mainland Greece, and Cilix who gave his name to Cilicia in Asia Minor, with the author of &quot;Bibliotheke&quot; including Phoenix as a third. So some interpret this as her brother Phoenix (when he is assumed to be son of Agenor) gave his siblings&#x27; name to his three children and this Europa (by this case, niece of former) is also loved by Zeus, but because of the same name, gave some confusions to others. After arriving in Crete, Europa had three sons fathered by Zeus: Minos, Rhadamanthus, and Sarpedon, the first two becoming judges of the Underworld, alongside Aeacus of Aegina, when they died. In Crete she married Asterion, also rendered Asterius, and became mother (or step-mother) of his daughter Crete. Pausanias wrote that the poet Praxilla makes Carnus a son of Europa.
== Mythology ==
The &quot;Dictionary of Classical Mythology&quot; explains that Zeus was enamoured of Europa and decided to seduce or rape her, the two being near-equivalent in Greek myth. He transformed himself into a tame white bull and mixed in with her father&#x27;s herds. While Europa and her helpers were gathering flowers, she saw the bull, caressed his flanks, and eventually got onto his back. Zeus took that opportunity and ran to the sea and swam, with her on his back, to the island of Crete. He then revealed his true identity, and Europa became the first queen of Crete. Zeus gave her a necklace made by Hephaestus and three additional gifts: the bronze automaton guard Talos, the hound Laelaps who never failed to catch his quarry, and a javelin that never missed. Zeus later re-created the shape of the white bull in the stars, which is now known as the constellation Taurus. It should not be confused with the Cretan Bull that fathered the Minotaur and was captured by Heracles. Roman mythology adopted the tale of the &quot;Raptus&quot;, also known as &quot;The Abduction of Europa&quot; and &quot;The Seduction of Europa&quot;, substituting the god Jupiter for Zeus.

The myth of Europa and Zeus may have its origin in a sacred union between the Phoenician deities `Aštar and `Aštart (Astarte), in bovine form. Having given birth to three sons by Zeus, Europa married a king Asterion, this being also the name of the Minotaur and an epithet of Zeus, likely derived from the name &quot;`Aštar&quot;.

According to Herodotus&#x27; rationalizing approach, Europa was kidnapped by Greeks (probably Cretans), who were seeking to avenge the kidnapping of Io, a princess from Argos. His variant story may have been an attempt to rationalize the earlier myth; or the present myth may be a garbled version of facts—the abduction of a Phoenician aristocrat—later enunciated without gloss by Herodotus.

== Cult ==

===Astarte and Europa===
In the territory of Phoenician Sidon, Lucian of Samosata (2nd century AD) was informed that the temple of Astarte, whom Lucian equated with the moon goddess, was sacred to Europa:

: There is likewise in Phœnicia a temple of great size owned by the Sidonians. They call it the temple of Astarte. I hold this Astarte to be no other than the moon-goddess. But according to the story of one of the priests this temple is sacred to Europa, the sister of Cadmus. She was the daughter of Agenor, and on her disappearance from Earth the Phœnicians honoured her with a temple and told a sacred legend about her; how that Zeus was enamoured of her for her beauty, and changing his form into that of a bull carried her off into Crete. This legend I heard from other Phœnicians as well; and the coinage current among the Sidonians bears upon it the effigy of Europa sitting upon a bull, none other than Zeus. Thus they do not agree that the temple in question is sacred to Europa. 

The paradox, as it seemed to Lucian, would be solved if Europa &quot;is&quot; Astarte in her guise as the full, &quot;broad-faced&quot; moon.

=== Interpretation ===
There were two competing myths relating how Europa came into the Hellenic world, but they agreed that she came to Crete (Kríti), where the sacred bull was paramount. In the more familiar telling she was seduced by the god Zeus in the form of a bull, who breathed from his mouth a saffron crocus and carried her away to Crete on his back—to be welcomed by Asterion, but according to the more literal, euhemerist version that begins the account of Persian-Hellene confrontations of Herodotus, she was kidnapped by Cretans, who likewise were said to have taken her to Crete. The mythical Europa cannot be separated from the mythology of the sacred bull, which had been worshipped in the Levant. In 2012, an archaeological mission of the British Museum led by Lebanese archaeologist, Claude Doumet-Serhal, discovered at the site of the old American school in Sidon, Lebanon currency that depicts Europa riding the bull with her veil flying all over like a bow, further proof of Europa&#x27;s Phoenician origin.

Europa does not seem to have been venerated directly in cult anywhere in classical Greece, but at Lebadaea in Boeotia, Pausanias noted in the 2nd century AD that &quot;Europa&quot; was the epithet of Demeter—&quot;Demeter whom they surname Europa and say was the nurse of Trophonios&quot;—among the Olympians who were addressed by seekers at the cave sanctuary of Trophonios of Orchomenus, to whom a chthonic cult and oracle were dedicated: &quot;the grove of Trophonios by the river Herkyna ... there is also a sanctuary of Demeter Europa ... the nurse of Trophonios.&quot;

The festival of Hellotia in Crete was celebrated in honour of Europa.

== Argive genealogy ==
==In art and literature==

&quot;Europa&quot; provided the substance of a brief Hellenistic epic written in the mid-2nd century BCE by Moschus, a bucolic poet and friend of the Alexandrian grammarian Aristarchus of Samothrace, born at Syracuse.

In &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; Book II, the poet Ovid wrote the following depiction of Jupiter&#x27;s seduction:
His picturesque details belong to anecdote and fable: in all the depictions, whether she straddles the bull, as in archaic vase-paintings or the ruined metope fragment from Sikyon, or sits gracefully sidesaddle as in a mosaic from North Africa, there is no trace of fear. Often Europa steadies herself by touching one of the bull&#x27;s horns, acquiescing.

Her tale is also mentioned in Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;Tanglewood Tales&quot;. Though his story titled &quot;Dragon&#x27;s teeth&quot; is largely about Cadmus, it begins with an elaborate albeit toned down version of Europa&#x27;s abduction by the beautiful bull.

The tale also features as the subject of a poem and film in the Enderby (fictional character) sequence of novels by Anthony Burgess. She is remembered in &quot;De Mulieribus Claris&quot;, a collection of biographies of historical and mythological women by the Florentine author Giovanni Boccaccio, composed in 136162. It is notable as the first collection devoted exclusively to biographies of women in Western literature.

==Namesakes==
===Continent===
The name Europe, as a geographical term, was used by Ancient Greek geographers such as Strabo to refer to part of Thrace below the Balkan Mountains. Later, under the Roman Empire the name was given to a Thracian province. Thrace or Thraike in Greek mythology, was the sister of a water nymph named Europa. Europa was also a surname given to the earth mother goddess Demeter.

It is derived from the Greek word &quot;Eurōpē&quot; () in all Romance languages, Germanic languages, Slavic languages, Baltic languages, Celtic languages, Iranian languages, Uralic languages (Hungarian Európa, Finnish Eurooppa, Estonian Euroopa).

Jürgen Fischer, in &quot;Oriens-Occidens-Europa&quot; summarized how the name came into use, supplanting the &quot;oriens&quot;–&quot;occidens&quot; dichotomy of the later Roman Empire, which was expressive of a divided empire, Latin in the West, Greek in the East.
In the 8th century, ecclesiastical uses of &quot;Europa&quot; for the imperium of Charlemagne provide the source for the modern geographical term. The first use of the term &quot;&quot;, to describe peoples of the Christian, western portion of the continent, appeared in the Hispanic Latin Chronicle of 754, sometimes attributed to an author called Isidore Pacensis in reference to the Battle of Tours fought against Muslim forces.

The European Union has also used Europa as a symbol of pan-Europeanism, notably by naming its web portal after her and depicting her on the Greek €2 coin and on several gold and silver commemorative coins (e.g. the Belgian €10 European Expansion coin). Her name appeared on postage stamps celebrating the Council of Europe, which were first issued in 1956. The second series of euro banknotes is known as the Europa Series and bears her likeness in the watermark and hologram.
====Chemical element====

The metal &quot;europium&quot;, a rare-earth element, was named in 1901 after the continent.

===Moon of Jupiter===
The invention of the telescope revealed that the planet Jupiter, clearly visible to the naked eye and known to humanity since prehistoric times, has an attendant family of moons. These were named for male and female lovers of the god and other mythological persons associated with him. The smallest of Jupiter&#x27;s Galilean moons was named after Europa.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Byzantine Empire ====
* Arab–Byzantine War: Emperor Nikephoros II conquers the fortress cities of Tarsus and Mopsuestia. The Muslim residents abandon the defense and flee into Syria. Nikephoros completes the conquest of Cilicia; Muslim raids into Anatolia (modern Turkey) permanently cease. Byzantine troops under General Niketas Chalkoutzes occupy Cyprus, liberating the Greek population from Muslim domination.
* Battle of the Straits: The Byzantine attempt to recover Sicily fails, when the Byzantine fleet is annihilated by the Fatimids. The last Byzantine stronghold on the island, Rometta, surrenders. The population is massacred, and the survivors are sold into slavery. Caliph Al-Mu&#x27;izz li-Din Allah completes the conquest of Sicily, and establishes naval superiority in the Western Mediterranean.

==== Europe ====
* Spring – King Lothair III exploits the succession crisis in Flanders and captures many cities, but is eventually repulsed by the supporters of Arnulf II – the son of Baldwin III and former co-ruler of Flanders. Lothair attempts to increase his influence in Lotharingia, once held by the Carolingian dynasty. Emperor Otto I (the Great) encourages resistance to Lothair&#x27;s overtures.
* Boleslaus I (the Cruel), duke of Bohemia, expands his territory into the Polish territories of Upper Silesia and Lesser Poland. By occupying the city of Kraków, he controls important trade routes from Prague to Kyiv and Lviv. Prince Mieszko I of Poland makes an alliance with Boleslaus and marries his daughter Dobrawa.
* The Khazar fortress city of Sarkel, located on the Lower Don River, is captured by Kievan Rus&#x27; under Grand Prince Sviatoslav I. The city is renamed Belaya Vezha (&quot;White Fortress&quot;) and settled by Slavs.

==== China ====
* July 12 – Emperor Meng Chang of Later Shu dies after a 30-year reign. His kingdom is invaded and incorporated into the expanding Song dynasty.

=== By topic ===

==== Literature ====
* September 23 – Al-Mutanabbi, an Abbasid poet, returns from 5 years in Mesopotamia. He has lived at Shiraz under the protection of the Buyid emir &#x27;Adud al-Dawla, but bandits kill him near An Numaniyah (modern Iran).

==== Religion ====
* March 1 – Pope Leo VIII dies after a 13-month reign. He is succeeded by John XIII as the 133rd pope of the Catholic Church.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

<doc id="47222" wikidata="Q152091" url="?curid=47222" title="3753 Cruithne">
<text>3753 Cruithne is a Q-type, Aten asteroid in orbit around the Sun in 1:1 orbital resonance with Earth, making it a co-orbital object. It is an asteroid that, relative to Earth, orbits the Sun in a bean-shaped orbit that effectively describes a horseshoe, and that can change into a quasi-satellite orbit. Cruithne does not orbit Earth and at times it is on the other side of the Sun, placing Cruithne well outside of Earth&#x27;s Hill sphere. Its orbit takes it near the orbit of Mercury and outside the orbit of Mars. Cruithne orbits the Sun in about one Earth year, but it takes 770 years for the series to complete a horseshoe-shaped movement around Earth.

The asteroid takes its name from the Cruithne, a people mentioned in early Irish annals.

== Discovery ==
Cruithne was discovered on 10 October 1986 by Duncan Waldron on a photographic plate taken with the UK Schmidt Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory, Coonabarabran, Australia. A 1983 precovery (1983 UH) is credited to Giovanni de Sanctis and Richard M. West of the European Southern Observatory in Chile.

It was not until 1997 that its unusual orbit was determined by Paul Wiegert and Kimmo Innanen, working at York University in Toronto, and Seppo Mikkola, working at the University of Turku in Finland.

== Dimensions and orbit ==

Cruithne is approximately in diameter, and its closest approach to Earth is , approximately thirty times the separation between Earth and the Moon. From 1994 through 2015, Cruithne made its annual closest approach to Earth every November.

Although Cruithne&#x27;s orbit is not thought to be stable over the long term, calculations by Wiegert and Innanen showed that it has probably been synchronized with Earth&#x27;s orbit for a long time. There is no danger of a collision with Earth for millions of years, if ever. Its orbital path and Earth&#x27;s do not cross, and its orbital plane is currently tilted to that of Earth by 19.8°. Cruithne, having a maximum near-Earth magnitude of +15.8, is fainter than Pluto and would require at least a reflecting telescope to be seen.

Cruithne is in a normal elliptic orbit around the Sun. Its period of revolution around the Sun, approximately 364 days in the early 21st century, is almost equal to that of Earth. Because of this, Cruithne and Earth appear to &quot;follow&quot; each other in their paths around the Sun. This is why Cruithne is sometimes called &quot;Earth&#x27;s second moon&quot;. However, it does not orbit Earth and is not a moon. In 2058, Cruithne will come within 0.09 AU () of Mars.

Due to a high orbital eccentricity, Cruithne&#x27;s distance from the Sun and orbital speed vary a lot more than Earth&#x27;s, so from Earth&#x27;s point of view Cruithne actually follows a kidney-bean-shaped horseshoe orbit ahead of Earth, taking slightly less than one year to complete a circuit of the &quot;bean&quot;. Because it takes slightly less than a year, Earth &quot;falls behind&quot; the bean a little more each year, and so, from the point of view of an observer on Earth, the circuit is not quite closed, but rather like a spiral loop that moves slowly away from Earth.

After many years, Earth will have fallen so far behind that Cruithne will then actually be &quot;catching up&quot; on Earth from &quot;behind&quot;. When it eventually does catch up, Cruithne will make a series of annual close approaches to Earth and gravitationally exchange orbital energy with Earth; this will alter Cruithne&#x27;s orbit by a little over half a million kilometres—while Earth&#x27;s orbit is altered by about —so that its period of revolution around the Sun will then become slightly more than a year. The kidney bean will then start to migrate away from Earth again in the opposite direction—instead of Earth &quot;falling behind&quot; the bean, it is &quot;pulling away from&quot; the bean. The next such series of close approaches will be centred on the year 2292—in July of that year, Cruithne will approach Earth to about .

After 380 to 390 years or so, the kidney-bean-shaped orbit approaches Earth again from the other side, and Earth, once more, alters the orbit of Cruithne so that its period of revolution around the Sun is again slightly less than a year (this last happened with a series of close approaches centred on 1902, and will next happen with a series centered on 2676). The pattern then repeats itself.

== Similar minor planets ==
More near-resonant near-Earth objects (NEOs) have since been discovered. These include 54509 YORP, , , and which exist in resonant orbits similar to Cruithne&#x27;s. is the first identified Earth trojan (out of only two known ).

Other examples of natural bodies known to be in horseshoe orbits (with respect to each other) include Janus and Epimetheus, natural satellites of Saturn. The orbits these two moons follow around Saturn are much simpler than the one Cruithne follows, but operate along the same general principles.

Mars has four known co-orbital asteroids (5261 Eureka, , , and , all at the Lagrangian points), and Jupiter has many (an estimated one million greater than 1 km in diameter, the Jovian trojans); there are also other small co-orbital moons in the Saturnian system: Telesto and Calypso with Tethys, and Helene and Polydeuces with Dione. However, none of these follow horseshoe orbits.

== In popular culture ==
Cruithne plays a major role in Stephen Baxter&#x27;s novel &quot;&quot;, which was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award for best science fiction in 2000.

Cruithne is mentioned on the &quot;QI&quot; season 1 episode &quot;Astronomy&quot;, in which it is described as a second moon of Earth. In a later episode, it was added that, if using the same definition, Earth has over 18,000 &quot;mini-moons&quot;.

In &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot;, Cruithne is the site of a secret lab assaulted by Abigail Brand and her S.W.O.R.D. team. It contains many Brood before Brand destroys it.

In the Insignia trilogy, 3753 Cruithne has been moved into an orbit around Earth to serve as a training ground for the Intrasolar Forces. In the third novel, &quot;Catalyst&quot;, it is intentionally directed at Earth. While it is destroyed before impact, its fragments rain down on Earth&#x27;s surface, killing nearly 800 million people across the world.

<text>4179 Toutatis (provisional designation ) is an elongated, stony asteroid and slow rotator, classified as a near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid of the Apollo asteroid group, approximately 2.5 kilometers in diameter. Discovered by French astronomer Christian Pollas at Caussols in 1989, the asteroid was named after Toutatis from Celtic mythology.

Toutatis is also a Mars-crosser asteroid with a chaotic orbit produced by a 3:1 resonance with the planet Jupiter, a 1:4 resonance with the planet Earth, and frequent close approaches to the terrestrial planets, including Earth. In December 2012, Toutatis passed within about 18 lunar distances of Earth. The Chinese lunar probe Chang&#x27;e 2 flew by the asteroid at a distance of 3.2 kilometers and a relative velocity of 10.73 km/s. Toutatis approached Earth again in 2016, but will not make another notably close approach until 2069.

== Properties ==

Toutatis was first sighted on 10 February 1934, as object 1934 CT, but lost soon afterwards. It remained a lost asteroid for several decades until it was rediscovered on 4 January 1989 by French astronomer Christian Pollas, and was named after the Celtic god of tribal protection Toutatis (Teutates). The name of this god is very familiar in France due to the catchphrase &quot;Par Toutatis!&quot; by the Gauls in the comics Asterix.

The spectral properties suggest that this is an S-type, or stony asteroid, consisting primarily of silicates. It has a moderate Bond albedo of 0.13. Radar imagery shows that Toutatis is a highly irregular body consisting of two distinct lobes, with maximum widths of about 4.6 km and 2.4 km, respectively. It is hypothesized that Toutatis formed from two originally separate bodies which coalesced at some point (a contact binary), with the resultant asteroid being compared to a rubble pile.

Its rotation combines two separate periodic motions into a non-periodic result; to someone on the surface of Toutatis, the Sun would seem to rise and set in apparently random locations and at random times at the asteroid&#x27;s horizon. It has a rotation period around its long axis (Pψ) of 5.38 days. This long axis is precessing with a period (Pφ) of 7.38 days. The asteroid may have lost most of its original angular momentum and entered into this tumbling motion as a result of the YORP effect.

== Orbit ==

With a semimajor axis of 2.5294 AU, or roughly 2.5 times the distance between Earth and the Sun, Toutatis has a 3:1 orbital resonance with Jupiter and a near-1:4 resonance with Earth making it a member of the Alinda asteroid group. It thus completes one orbit around the Sun for every 4.02 annual orbits of Earth. The gravitational perturbations caused by frequent close approaches to the terrestrial planets lead to chaotic behavior in the orbit of Toutatis, making precise long-term predictions of its location progressively inaccurate over time. Estimates in 1993 put the Lyapunov time horizon for predictability at around 50 years, after which the uncertainty region becomes larger with each close approach to a planet. Without the perturbations from the terrestrial planets the Lyapunov time would be close to 10,000 years. The initial observations that showed its chaotic behavior were made by Wiśniewski.

The low inclination (0.47°) of the orbit allows frequent transits, where the inner planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars can appear to cross the Sun as seen from the perspective of Toutatis. Earth did this in January 2009, July 2012, July 2016 and 2020.

=== Close approaches and collision risk ===

Toutatis makes frequent close approaches to Earth, with a currently minimum possible distance (Earth MOID) of just 0.006 AU (2.3 times as far as the Moon). The approach on 29 September 2004 was particularly close, at 0.0104 AU (within 4 lunar distances) from Earth, presenting a good opportunity for observation, with Toutatis having an apparent magnitude of 8.8 at its brightest. A close approach of happened on 9 November 2008. The most recent close approach was on 12 December 2012, at a distance of , with a magnitude of 10.7. At magnitude 10.7, Toutatis was not visible to the naked eye, but just visible to experienced observers using high-end binoculars. During the 2012 encounter Toutatis was recovered on 21 May 2012, by the Siding Spring Survey at apparent magnitude 18.9. A close approach will be 5 November 2069, at .

Given that Toutatis makes many close approaches to Earth, such as in 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016, it is listed as a potentially hazardous object. With an uncertainty parameter of 0, the orbit of Toutatis is very well determined for the next few hundred years. The probability of the orbit intersecting Earth is essentially zero for at least the next six centuries. The likelihood of collision in the distant future is considered to be very small. As a planet-crossing asteroid, Toutatis is likely to be ejected from the inner Solar System within a few million years. In 2004 a chain e-mail falsely claimed that Toutatis had a 63% chance of impacting Earth then. In fact, Toutatis passed by at 1.5 million kilometres, or about four Earth–Moon distances, as predicted.

In 2006 Toutatis came closer than 2 AU to Jupiter; its orbit lies inside of Jupiter&#x27;s. In the 2100s, it will approach Jupiter many times at a similar distance.

== Physical characteristics ==
Large amounts of data of Toutatis were obtained during Chang&#x27;e 2&#x27;s flyby. Toutatis is not a monolith, but most likely a coalescence of shattered fragments. This bifurcated asteroid is shown to be mainly consisting of a head (small lobe) and a body (large lobe). The two major parts are not round in shape, and their surfaces have a number of large facets. In comparison with radar models, the proximate observations from Chang&#x27;e 2&#x27;s flyby have revealed several remarkable discoveries concerning Toutatis, among which the presence of the giant basin at the big end appears to be one of the most compelling geological features, and the sharply perpendicular silhouette in the neck region that connects the head and body is also quite novel. A large number of boulders and several short linear structures are also apparent on the surface.

=== Giant basin ===

The giant basin at the big end of Toutatis has a diameter of ~805 m, suggesting that one or more impactors may have collided with it there. The most significant feature is the ridge around the largest basin. The wall of this basin has a relatively high density of lineaments, some of which seem to be concentric to the basin. These ridges are indicative of an internal structure of small bodies and most of the ridges near the largest basin at the big end are most likely related to the huge stress energy during impact.

== Observation ==

Toutatis has been observed with radar imaging from the Arecibo Observatory and the Goldstone Solar System Radar during the asteroid&#x27;s prior Earth flybys in 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, and 2008. It was also observed with radar during the December 2012 flyby and observed more distant flyby with radar in December 2016. After 2016, Toutatis will not pass close to Earth again until 2069.

Resolution of the radar images is as fine as 3.75 m per pixel, providing data to model Toutatis&#x27;s shape and spin state.

== Exploration ==
The Chinese lunar probe Chang&#x27;e 2 departed from the Sun–Earth L2 point in April 2012 and made a flyby of Toutatis on 13 December 2012, with closest approach being 3.2 kilometers and a relative velocity of 10.73 km/s, when Toutatis was near its closest approach to Earth. It took several pictures of the asteroid, revealing it to be a dusty red/orange color.

<doc id="47229" wikidata="Q179014" url="?curid=47229" title="Io (mythology)">
<text>In Greek mythology, Io (; ) was one of the mortal lovers of Zeus. An Argive princess, she was an ancestor of many kings and heroes, such as Perseus, Cadmus, Heracles, Minos, Lynceus, Cepheus, and Danaus. The astronomer Simon Marius named a moon of Jupiter after Io in 1614.
Because her brother was Phoroneus, Io is also known as Phoronis (an adjective form of Phoroneus: &quot;Phoronean&quot;). She was sometimes compared to the Egyptian goddess Isis, whereas her Egyptian husband Telegonus was Osiris.

== Family ==
In most versions of the legend, Io was the daughter of Inachus, though various other purported genealogies are also known. If her father was Inachus, then her mother would presumably have been Inachus&#x27; wife (and sister), the Oceanid nymph Melia, daughter of Oceanus.
She had the patronymic Inachis (Ἰναχίς) as daughter of Inachus.

Io&#x27;s father was called Peiren in the &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot;, and by Acusilaus, possibly a son of the elder Argus, also known as Peiras, Peiranthus or Peirasus. Io may therefore be identical to Callithyia, daughter of Peiranthus, as is suggested by Hesychius of Alexandria.

The 2nd century AD geographer Pausanias mentions another, later Io, descendant of Phoroneus, daughter of Iasus, who himself was the son of Argus and Ismene, the daughter of Asopus, or of Triopas and Sosis; Io&#x27;s mother in the latter case was Leucane.

== Mythology ==
=== Io and Zeus ===
Io was a priestess of the goddess Hera in Argos, whose cult her father Inachus was supposed to have introduced to Argos. Zeus noticed Io, a mortal woman, and lusted after her. In the version of the myth told in &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; she initially rejected Zeus&#x27; advances, until her father threw her out of his house on the advice of oracles. According to some stories, Zeus then turned Io into a heifer in order to hide her from his wife; others maintain that Hera herself transformed Io.

In the version of the story in which Zeus transformed Io, the deception failed, and Hera begged Zeus to give her the heifer as a present, which, having no reason to refuse, he did. Pitying the unfortunate girl, Gaia, the goddess of the earth, created the violet (), so the cow could eat, thus growing &quot;from her from whom it has its name&quot;, based on incorrect folk etymology. The various colours of the violet (red, purple, white) changed on account of Io&#x27;s life, red for the blushing maiden, purple for the cow, white for the stars. Hera then sent Argus Panoptes, a giant who had 100 eyes, to watch Io and prevent Zeus from visiting her, and so Zeus sent Hermes to distract and eventually slay Argus. According to Ovid, he did so by first lulling him to sleep by playing the panpipes and telling stories. Zeus freed Io, still in the form of a heifer. In some myths, Hera uses Argus&#x27; eyes to decorate her peacock&#x27;s feathers to thank the giant for his help.

In order to exact her revenge, Hera sent a gadfly to sting Io continuously, driving her to wander the world without rest. Io eventually crossed the path between the Propontis and the Black Sea, which thus acquired the name Bosporus (meaning &quot;ox passage&quot;), where she met Prometheus, who had been chained on Mt. Caucasus by Zeus. Prometheus comforted Io with the information that she would be restored to human form and become the ancestress of the greatest of all heroes, Heracles (Hercules). Io escaped across the Ionian Sea to Egypt, where she was restored to human form by Zeus. There, she gave birth to Zeus&#x27;s son Epaphus, and a daughter as well, Keroessa. She later married Egyptian king Telegonus. Their grandson, Danaus, eventually returned to Greece with his fifty daughters (the Danaids), as recalled in Aeschylus&#x27; play &quot;The Suppliants&quot;.

The myth of Io must have been well known to Homer, who often calls Hermes &quot;Argeiphontes&quot;, which is often translated as &quot;Argus-slayer&quot;, though this interpretation is disputed by Robert Beekes. Walter Burkert notes that the story of Io was told in the ancient epic tradition at least four times of which we have traces: in the &quot;Danais&quot;, in the &quot;Phoronis&quot;—Phoroneus founded the cult of Hera, according to Hyginus&#x27; &quot;Fabulae&quot; 274 and 143—in a fragment of the Hesiodic &quot;Aigimios&quot;, as well as in similarly fragmentary Hesiodic &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot;. A mourning commemoration of Io was observed at the Heraion of Argos into classical times.

The ancients connected Io with the Moon, and in Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, where Io encounters Prometheus, she refers to herself as &quot;the horned virgin&quot;. From her relationship with Phoroneus, as sister (or descendant), Io is sometimes called Phoronis.

According to the Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology by William Smith, Io at some point landed at Damalis, and the Chalcedonians erected a bronze cow on the spot.

=== Io as Isis ===

Lygdus and his wife, Telethusa, were a poor couple living in Crete. When Telethusa becomes pregnant, her husband tells her that they cannot afford to have a daughter, and that they have no other option than to kill the child if it is a daughter. Eight months later Io, later in the story mentioned as Isis, comes in a vision to Telethusa telling her that she should keep her daughter when it is born and must tell her husband that it is a boy named Iphis.

Later in the story, Isis (Io) changes Iphis&#x27; sex when she is supposed to marry her fiancée, Ianthe.

253 Mathilde is an asteroid in the intermediate asteroid belt, approximately 50 kilometers in diameter, that was discovered by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa at Vienna Observatory on 12 November 1885. It has a relatively elliptical orbit that requires more than four years to circle the Sun. This tumbling asteroid has an unusually slow rate of rotation, requiring 17.4 days to complete a 360° about its axis. It is a primitive C-type asteroid, which means the surface has a high proportion of carbon; giving it a dark surface that reflects only 4% of the light that falls on it.

Mathilde was visited by the NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft during June 1997, on its way to asteroid 433 Eros. During the short flyby, the spacecraft imaged a hemisphere of the asteroid, revealing many large craters that had gouged out depressions in the surface. It was the first carbonaceous asteroid to be explored and, until 21 Lutetia was visited in 2010, it was the largest asteroid to be visited by a spacecraft.

==Observation history==
In 1880, Johann Palisa, the director of the Austrian Naval Observatory , was offered a position as an assistant at the newly completed Vienna Observatory. Although the job represented a demotion for Johann, it gave him access to the new refractor, the largest telescope in the world at that time. By this point Johann had already discovered 27 asteroids, and he would employ the Vienna and instruments to find an additional 94 asteroids before he retired.

Among his discoveries was the asteroid 253 Mathilde, found on 12 November 1885. The initial orbital elements of the asteroid were then computed by V. A. Lebeuf, another Austrian astronomer working at the Paris Observatory. The name of the asteroid was suggested by Lebeuf, after Mathilde, the wife of Moritz Loewy—who was the vice director of the observatory in Paris.

In 1995, ground-based observations determined that Mathilde is a C-type asteroid. It was also found to have an unusually long period of rotation of 418 hours.

On 27 June 1997, the NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft passed within 1,212 km of Mathilde while moving at a velocity of 9.93 km/s. This close approach allowed the spacecraft to capture over 500 images of the surface, and provided data for more accurate determinations of the asteroid&#x27;s dimensions and mass (based on gravitational perturbation of the spacecraft). However, only one hemisphere of Mathilde was imaged during the fly-by. This was only the third asteroid to be imaged from a nearby distance, following 951 Gaspra and 243 Ida.

==Characteristics==

Mathilde is very dark, with an albedo comparable to fresh asphalt, and is thought to share the same composition as CI1 or CM2 carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, with a surface dominated by phyllosilicate minerals. The asteroid has a number of extremely large craters, with the individual craters being named for coal fields and basins around the world. The two largest craters, Ishikari (29.3 km) and Karoo (33.4 km), are as wide as the asteroid&#x27;s average radius. The impacts appear to have spalled large volumes off the asteroid, as suggested by the angular edges of the craters. Uniformity in brightness and colour were visible in the craters and there was no appearance of layering, so the asteroid&#x27;s interior must be very homogeneous. There are indications of material movement along the downslope direction.

The density measured by NEAR Shoemaker, 1,300 kg/m3, is less than half that of a typical carbonaceous chondrite; this may indicate that the asteroid is very loosely packed rubble pile. The same is true of several C-type asteroids studied by ground-based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics systems (45 Eugenia, 90 Antiope, 87 Sylvia and 121 Hermione). Up to 50% of the interior volume of Mathilde consists of open space. However, the existence of a 20-km-long scarp may indicate that the asteroid does have some structural strength, so it could contain some large internal components. The low interior density is an inefficient transmitter of impact shock through the asteroid, which also helps to preserve the surface features to a high degree.

Mathilde&#x27;s orbit is eccentric, taking it to the outer reaches of the belt. Nonetheless, the orbit lies entirely between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter; it does not cross the planetary orbits. It also has one of the slowest rotation periods of the known asteroids—most asteroids have a rotation period in the range of 2–24 hours. Because of the slow rotation rate, NEAR Shoemaker was sadly only able to photograph 60% of the asteroid&#x27;s surface. The slow rate of rotation may be accounted for by a satellite orbiting the asteroid, but a search of the NEAR images revealed none larger than 10 km in diameter out to 20 times the radius of Mathilde.

<text>16 Psyche ( ) is a large M-type asteroid, which was discovered by the Italian astronomer Annibale de Gasparis, on 17 March 1852 and named after the Greek goddess Psyche.

The prefix &quot;16&quot; signifies that it was the sixteenth minor planet in order of discovery.
It is the largest and most massive of the M-type asteroids, and one of the dozen most massive asteroids. It has a mean diameter of approximately and contains about one percent of the cumulative mass of the whole asteroid belt. It was thought to be the exposed core of a protoplanet, but recent observations cast doubt on that hypothesis. 

Psyche will be explored by NASA, with a spacecraft of the same name, marking the first time a manmade object will journey to a metallic asteroid, launched on 13 October 2023, with an expected arrival in 2029.

== Symbol ==

Astronomers created icon-like symbols for the first fifteen asteroids to be discovered, as a type of shorthand notation consistent with older notation for the classical planets. Psyche was given an iconic symbol, as were a few other asteroids discovered after 16 Psyche. The symbol was a butterfly&#x27;s wing topped by a star ( or ), as the butterfly was a Greek symbol of the soul (&quot;psyche&quot; being the Greek word for both &quot;butterfly&quot; and &quot;soul&quot;). This symbol may have influenced the design of the official insignia for the NASA &quot;Psyche&quot; mission to this asteroid. It is in the pipeline for Unicode 17.0 as U+1CEC9 𜻉 ().

However, the iconic symbols for all asteroids were superseded before Psyche&#x27;s symbol ever came into use. With more than a dozen asteroids discovered, remembering all their individual emblems became increasingly cumbersome, and, in 1851, German astronomer J.F. Encke suggested using a circled number instead: . The first asteroid designated with the new scheme was , when American astronomer J. Ferguson published his observations in 1852.

== Characteristics ==
=== Size ===
The first size estimate of Psyche was and came from IRAS thermal infrared emission observations. This is 15% larger than the currently accepted mean value, but was later found to be an accurate estimate for the IRAS viewing aspect because Psyche was viewed pole-on at the time of the measurement.

Psyche has been observed to occult a star on nine occasions. Four of these, 2004, 2010, 2014, and 2019, generated multi-chord data sets and have been used along with adaptive optics imaging and three-dimensional modeling to estimate Psyche&#x27;s mean diameter, with recent models all converging to an equivalent-volume mean diameter of  km.

===Mass and bulk density===
Psyche is massive enough that its gravity observably perturbs other asteroids&#x27; orbits, which can be used to calculate a mass estimate. Historical values for Psyche&#x27;s mass have ranged from to . However, most recent estimates have begun to converge on values near . Assuming the mean volume of , this equates to a bulk density of , which is considerably higher than most small Solar System bodies.

===Shape and spin pole===
The first published three-dimensional shape model for Psyche was derived from an analysis of numerous 
light curves. Since then, additional refinements to the shape have been made based on the inversion of lightcurves, adaptive optics observations, radar observations, thermal imaging, and occultations. The most recent models show that Psyche has a shape consistent with a Jacobi ellipsoid and dimensions within a few km of 278 km x 238 km x 171 km.

Each shape model provides an estimate of the direction of the north pole (spin axis). All recent models for Psyche suggest it rotates about a pole pointed towards the ecliptic coordinates (long, lat) , , with a 3° uncertainty. This means that it is essentially tilted toward the ecliptic, with an axial tilt of 98°.

===Features===
Many features have been reported on Psyche. The largest of these are regions of mass-deficits relative to its nominal ellipsoid shape and are reminiscent of the Rheasilvia basin on 4 Vesta.

In addition to the large-scale regions of mass-deficit, several apparent craters have been reported. Observers using the Very Large Telescope&#x27;s adaptive optics SPHERE imager reported two large craters, on the order of 90 km across, which were provisionally named Meroe and Panthia , after the twin witches in the Roman novel &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; by Apuleius. Observers using the Arecibo Radar Telescope reported craters at the south pole (referred to as Delta), southern midlatitudes (referred to as Eros), and the north pole (referred to as Foxtrot). An analysis of the features present in several independent shape models suggests that craters Panthia and Eros are almost certainly real and Foxtrot is likely to be real. However, there is uncertainty over the existence of Meroe and Delta.

Early lightcurve studies suggested that Psyche has large variations in its surface brightness. These variations became more evident when attempts were made to invert lightcurves to generate shape models. The most recent shape models based on lightcurve inversions simultaneously solve for surface albedo variations, and the resulting maps show regions where local albedo differs from the mean albedo by more than 20% in either direction. Notably, the Meroe crater coincides with an area much darker than the mean, and the Panthia crater coincides with an area much brighter than the mean.

Radar observations with the Arecibo Radar Telescope revealed that Psyche&#x27;s &quot;background&quot; radar albedo is formula_1, comparable to other M-type asteroids like 21 Lutetia. This value is consistent with a silicate (rocky) regolith enriched in metal phases. However, in at least three locations, Psyche&#x27;s radar albedo is nearly twice this value, suggesting high concentrations of metal phases in these regions. One of these locations corresponds with the optically bright Panthia crater, while the other two correspond with regions that have been reported as optically bright. This apparent correlation between optical and radar albedos on Psyche has led to the hypothesis that there is a link between the process(es) that create regions of high metal content and brighter terrain.

=== Composition ===
The bulk density of Psyche () places constraints on its overall composition. The iron-nickel found in most iron meteorites has a bulk density of . If Psyche were the remnant core of an early planetesimal, it would have to have an overall porosity of 50%. Given Psyche&#x27;s size, this is considered highly improbable. However, there are other metal-rich meteorite types that have been suggested as Psyche analogs, each of which have bulk densities that are similar to Psyche&#x27;s, including enstatite chondrites, bencubbinites, and mesosiderites.

Several observers have reported the presence of silicate minerals on the surface of Psyche. Spectra taken in October 2016 at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility at the Mauna Kea Observatories showed evidence (~3 μm absorption feature) of hydroxyl ions on the asteroid that may suggest the presence of hydrated silicates. Since Psyche is thought to have formed under dry conditions without the presence of water, the hydroxyl may have reached Psyche via past impacts from smaller carbonaceous asteroids.

Psyche&#x27;s radar albedo varies considerably over the surface, ranging from 0.22 to 0.52, values that are two to four times as high as most main-belt asteroids. Models of radar reflection equate this range of values with regolith bulk densities of 2.6 to 4.7 . This range is consistent with most of the metal-rich meteorite classes noted above and the spectroscopic detection of silicate minerals. It is inconsistent with a pure iron-nickel regolith unless it is highly porous.

===Origin===
Several possible origins have been proposed for Psyche. The earliest of these was that Psyche is an exposed metallic core resulting from a collision that stripped away the crust and mantle of an originally larger differentiated parent body some 500 kilometers in diameter. Other versions of this include the idea that it was not the result of a single large collision but multiple (more than three) relatively slow sideswipe collisions with bodies of comparable or larger size. However, this idea has fallen out of recent favor as mass and density estimates are inconsistent with a remnant core.

A second hypothesis is that Psyche was disrupted and gravitationally re-accreted into a mix of metal and silicate. In this case, it may be a candidate for the parent body of the mesosiderites, a class of stony–iron meteorites.

A third hypothesis is that Psyche may be a differentiated object, like 1 Ceres and 4 Vesta, but has experienced a type of iron volcanism, also known as ferrovolcanism, while still cooling. If true, this model predicts that metal would be highly enriched only in those regions containing (relic) volcanic centers. This view has been bolstered by recent radar observations.

== Exploration ==

No spacecraft has visited Psyche, but a mission to Psyche was proposed to NASA in 2014. A team led by Lindy Elkins-Tanton, the director of the School for Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, presented a concept for a robotic &quot;Psyche&quot; orbiter. This team argued that 16 Psyche would be a valuable object for study because it is the only metallic core-like body discovered so far.

The spacecraft would orbit Psyche for 20 months, studying its topography, surface features, gravity, magnetism, and other characteristics and would be based on current technology, avoiding high cost and the necessity to develop new technologies. On 30 September 2015, the &quot;Psyche&quot; orbiter mission was one of five Discovery Program semifinalist proposals.

The mission was approved by NASA on 4 January 2017 and was originally targeted to launch in October 2023, with an Earth gravity assist maneuver in 2024, a Mars flyby in 2025, and arriving at the asteroid in 2030. In May 2017, the launch date was moved up to target a more efficient trajectory, launching in 2022, with a Mars gravity assist in 2023 and arriving in 2026. However, problems with Psyche&#x27;s flight software led NASA to revert to the original launch timeline.

On 28 February 2020, NASA awarded SpaceX a US$117 million contract to launch the &quot;Psyche&quot; spacecraft, and two smallsat secondary missions, on a Falcon Heavy rocket. The spacecraft was successfully launched on 13 October 2023, at 14:19 UTC, with an expected arrival in 2029.

Asteroid Psyche has an Earth-MOID of , and most recently came to opposition on 6 August 2024 when it was from Earth.

<doc id="47236" wikidata="Q2115876" url="?curid=47236" title="Psyche (band)">
<text>Psyche are a Canadian dark synth-pop band, now based in Germany. They are centered on singer Darrin Huss, who has been the only constant member, with various line-ups including his brother Stephen Huss, later followed by David Kristian, Per-Anders Kurenbach, and Remi Szyszka, all recording albums with Darrin under the name Psyche.

==History==
===Formation===
Psyche was formed by brothers Darrin and Stephen Huss in Edmonton, Alberta, named after the B-Side of Killing Joke&#x27;s &quot;Wardance&quot; single as well as being chosen for the meaning of the word. The band&#x27;s debut performance was on December 13, 1982, with Dwayne Goettel on additional keyboards.

During this period, Psyche performed bizarre live shows wherein Darrin performed nude (except for being covered in shaving cream) while talk-singing and shouting over the music. The performance idea was prompted by pictures seen of Fad Gadget in British Music magazines.

While demos were recorded during the collaboration with Dwayne Goettel, no albums were released until 1985&#x27;s &quot;Insomnia Theatre&quot;, after Goettel&#x27;s departure.

===Early years===
After &quot;Insomnia Theatre&quot; achieved moderate success in Europe, Psyche signed with New Rose Records in Paris. They released two singles followed by a studio album, &quot;Unveiling the Secret&quot;, in 1986. To promote the record, Psyche performed as the opening act for Suicide, at Élysée Montmartre in Paris, then as headliners on their own European tour.

After the release of their third studio album, &quot;Mystery Hotel&quot;, Stephen Huss was diagnosed with schizophrenia and took a hiatus from the group. During this period Darrin began collaborating with David Kristian, leading to a new album, &quot;The Influence&quot;, in 1989. This album introduced new elements to Psyche&#x27;s sound, with samples created by Kristian, and being performed entirely on the Casio FZ1. The songs &quot;Misery&quot;, and &quot;Haunted&quot; began Psyche&#x27;s shift to the dark wave music scene.

A visit home to Waterloo in 1991 reunited the Huss brothers and, the subsequent recording sessions produced 1991&#x27;s &quot;Daydream Avenue&quot;. Though Psyche returned to tour Europe with German keyboardist Johannes Haeusler in support of English poetic artist Anne Clark, Stephen Huss stayed behind in Canada because of his illness.

In 1994, the album &quot;Intimacy&quot;, produced in collaboration with Joseph Watt (of Razormaid) was released, along with a companion EP of dance numbers, &quot;Private Desires&quot;, which featured a cover of Soft Cell&#x27;s classic &quot;Sex Dwarf&quot;. The group embarked on a small German tour, but Stephen Huss remained in Canada, leaving Darrin to find new collaborators in Germany.

===Crossover success===
After another hiatus while Darrin took part in side projects, Psyche resumed activities in 1996 with Per-Anders Kurenbach joining as a new member. The first single release was &quot;You Ran Away&quot; with a cover version of &quot;Goodbye Horses&quot; by Q Lazzarus as the B-side. This cover version became a permanent staple in Psyche&#x27;s live repertoire, as well as being included on the album &quot;Strange Romance&quot;, which took a musical shift toward an accessible, upbeat pop sound.

After playing for the first time in Oslo, Norway and a return to Sweden, Psyche released a live video featuring highlights from their &quot;Strange Romance&quot; Tour. In 1998 the group signed with the StrangeWays label out of Hamburg, Germany, and released their eighth album, &quot;Love Among the Ruined&quot;, which included some experimental pop music.

At the beginning of 2000, Psyche signed to Artoffact Records of Toronto, Canada. The release of &quot;Misguided Angels&quot; contained material from 1983 through 2000 as a re-introduction of Psyche back on their original continent. It contained the last material from Per-Anders Kurenbach, and Darrin as well as some lesser-known mixes. By this point the partnership was dissolved, and Darrin began the next decade of music with Remi Szyszka as his collaborator in Psyche.

The new line-up made its debut on Accession Records with the single, &quot;Sanctuary&quot;, released in April 2001. After a series of concerts in both Europe and North America, a ninth studio album &quot;The Hiding Place&quot; was released and well-received, charting at fourth place in the year-end Top 100 of the German Alternative Charts. To capitalize on this success, a remix album entitled &quot;Endangered Species&quot; was released mid-2002. A series of live performances followed in 2003, along with the release of &quot;Babylon Deluxe&quot;, which appeared in the German Alternative Top Ten.

&quot;The 11th Hour&quot;, Psyche&#x27;s 11th album, featured the return of previous collaborator Per-Anders Kurenbach, but including a farewell track with Remi Szyszka, and a guest appearance by Christian Wirsig. &quot;The 11th Hour&quot; was released through Accession Records in Europe, Metropolis Records in North America, and Irond Records in Russia making it the widest release in the band&#x27;s history. The album topped the German Alternative Charts (DAC), ranking #1 for 7 weeks on the DAC Top 10 Albums of March, 2005. and Nr. 11 on the overall chart of that year.

In 2006, as the band neared its 25-year mark, a DVD collection documenting Psyche&#x27;s appearances in every incarnation from 1983 to 2005 was released. Titled &quot;Imaginary Life&quot;, its 23 tracks included at least one song from each of the previous albums released. It contains music videos and performances beginning with &quot;The Crawler&quot; on an Edmonton TV station in 1983 through to 2005, an audio commentary track, and a backstage interview with the Huss brothers in Sweden after their debut concert in Gothenburg in 1988.

Following &quot;The 11th Hour&quot;, Psyche shifted their focus to touring rather than recording, playing shows and festivals across Europe, North and South America, and South Africa. While no new studio albums were recorded, the band released remix albums (&quot;Unveiling the Secret 2.0&quot;, &quot;Until The Shadows&quot;, &quot;Halloween EP&quot;), compilations of old and unreleased materials (&quot;Re-Membering Dwayne&quot;, &quot;Unknown Treasures&quot;, &quot;As The Brain Collapses&quot;, &quot;Rare Mixes &amp; B-Sides&quot;), several live albums, and some re-releases of early albums.

In 2011, Psyche releases a cover album, &quot;Unknown Treasures&quot;, that includes re interpretations of songs by The Cure, The Doors, Depeche Mode or Visage. In 2012, they released the &quot;All Things Pass Into The Night&quot; EP which included a re-recorded extended version of &quot;Goodbye Horses&quot; on the Optimo Label. Also in 2012 Psyche released an updated version of &quot;The Influence&quot; album on Italian label Final Muzik, with new interpretations of the songs &quot;Misery&quot;, &quot;The Sundial&quot;, and &quot;Salvation Stranger&quot; as well as once again &quot;Goodbye Horses&quot; as &quot;Immortality Mix&quot;.

2014 saw a collaboration with Rational Youth resulting in an electronic interpretation of AC/DC&#x27;s hit &quot;Thunderstruck&quot; being released in three different coloured vinyl 7&quot; singles on Artoffact Records The bands toured together that same year across Scandinavia and Germany.

Psyche collaborated with Belgian artist LUMINANCE on two songs written by LUMINANCE and sung by Darrin Huss as PSYCHE on a limited coloured vinyl 7&quot; release on Artoffact Records in 2015.

Also in the same year, continuing with Artoffact Records, Psyche began re-releasing their 80s material starting with the 30th anniversary edition of their first 12&quot; single &quot;Thundershowers (In Ivory Towers) which was originally from 1985.

===Recent work===
In July 2016, the first three albums &quot;Insomnia Theatre&quot; (1985), &quot;Unveiling the Secret&quot; (1986/1987), and &quot;Mystery Hotel&quot; (1988) were digitally remastered and re-released as double albums including archival bonus tracks, plus related singles, and mixes.

Psyche released their a new original song &quot;Youth of Tomorrow&quot; as a video and digital release on Halloween, 2017. A 12&quot; single followed early 2018 making it their first official release of new material in 13 years. After some European dates that year, Psyche returned to Canada for their first official tour of their home country since the early 1980s.

In 2018 and 2019 VUZ Records released a pair of compilations named &quot;Under the Radar&quot; containing rare and unreleased Psyche tracks as limited edition CDs. Prior to embarking on a tour with Rational Youth in 2019, the band released two remixes of their 1987 single, &quot;Uncivilized,&quot; for which Jens Plöger provided the &quot;Dark Italo Mix&quot; under his studio name Run:.

<text>Amalthea is a moon of Jupiter. It has the third-closest orbit around Jupiter among known moons and was the fifth moon of Jupiter to be discovered, so it is also known as . It is also the fifth-largest moon of Jupiter, after the four Galilean moons. Edward Emerson Barnard discovered the moon on 9 September 1892 and named it after Amalthea of Greek mythology. It was the last natural satellite to be discovered by direct visual observation; all later moons were discovered by photographic or digital imaging.

Amalthea is in a close orbit around Jupiter and is within the outer edge of the Amalthea Gossamer Ring, which is formed from dust ejected from its surface. Jupiter would appear 46.5 degrees in diameter from its surface. Amalthea is the largest of the inner satellites of Jupiter and is irregularly shaped and reddish in color. It is thought to consist of porous water ice with unknown amounts of other materials. Its surface features include large craters and ridges.

Close-range images of Amalthea were taken in 1979 by the &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; spacecraft, and in more detail by the &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter in the 1990s.

==History==

=== Discovery ===
Amalthea was discovered on 9 September 1892 by Edward Emerson Barnard using the 36 inch (91 cm) refractor telescope at Lick Observatory. It was the last planetary satellite to be discovered by direct visual observation (as opposed to photographically) and was the first new satellite of Jupiter since Galileo Galilei&#x27;s discovery of the Galilean satellites in 1610.

===Name===
Amalthea is named after the nymph Amalthea from Greek mythology, who nursed the infant Zeus (the Greek equivalent of Jupiter) with goat&#x27;s milk. Its Roman numeral designation is Jupiter V. The name &quot;Amalthea&quot; was initially suggested by Camille Flammarion. It was not formally adopted by the IAU until 1976, although it had been in informal use for many decades. Before 1976, Amalthea was most commonly known simply as .

== Orbit ==
Amalthea orbits Jupiter at a distance of 181,000 km (2.54 Jupiter radii). The orbit of Amalthea has an eccentricity of 0.003 and an inclination of 0.37° relative to the equator of Jupiter. Such appreciably nonzero values of inclination and eccentricity, though still small, are unusual for an inner satellite and can be explained by the influence of the innermost Galilean satellite, Io: in the past Amalthea has passed through several mean-motion resonances with Io that have excited its inclination and eccentricity (in a mean-motion resonance the ratio of orbital periods of two bodies is a rational number like &quot;m&quot;:&quot;n&quot;).

Amalthea&#x27;s orbit lies near the outer edge of the Amalthea Gossamer Ring, which is composed of dust ejected from the satellite.

== Physical characteristics ==
The surface of Amalthea is the reddest in the solar system. This color may be due to sulfur originating from Io or some other non-ice material. Bright patches of less-red tint appear on the major slopes of Amalthea, but the nature of this color is currently unknown. The surface of Amalthea is slightly brighter than surfaces of other inner satellites of Jupiter. There is also a substantial asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres: the leading hemisphere is 1.3 times brighter than the trailing one. The asymmetry is probably caused by the higher velocity and frequency of impacts on the leading hemisphere, which excavates a bright material—presumably ice—from the interior of the moon.

Amalthea is irregularly shaped, with the best ellipsoidal approximation being . From this, Amalthea&#x27;s surface area is likely between 88,000 and 170,000 square kilometers, or somewhere near 130,000. Like all other inner moons of Jupiter, it is tidally locked with the planet, with the long axis pointing towards Jupiter at all times. Its surface is heavily scarred by craters, some of which are extremely large relative to the size of the moon: Pan, the largest crater, measures 100 km across and is at least 8 km deep. Another crater, Gaea, measures 80 km across and is likely twice as deep as Pan. Amalthea has several prominent bright spots, two of which are named. They are Lyctos Facula and Ida Facula, with a width reaching up to 25 km. They are located on the edge of ridges.

Amalthea&#x27;s irregular shape and large size led in the past to a conclusion that it is a fairly strong, rigid body, where it was argued that a body composed of ices or other weak materials would have been pulled into a more spherical shape by its own gravity. However, on 5 November 2002, the &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter made a targeted flyby that came within 160 km of Amalthea, and the deflection of its orbit was used to compute the moon&#x27;s mass (its volume had been calculated previously—to within 10% or so—from a careful analysis of all extant images). In the end, Amalthea&#x27;s density was found to be as low as , so it must be either a relatively icy body or very porous &quot;rubble pile&quot; or, more likely, something in between. Recent measurements of infrared spectra from the Subaru telescope suggest that the moon indeed contains hydrous minerals, indicating that it cannot have formed in its current position, since the hot primordial Jupiter would have melted it. It is therefore likely to have formed farther from the planet or to be a captured Solar System body. No images were taken during this flyby (&quot;Galileo&quot;″s cameras had been deactivated due to radiation damage in January 2002), and the resolution of other available images is generally low.

Amalthea radiates slightly more heat than it receives from the Sun, which is probably due to the influence of Jovian heat flux (&lt;9 kelvins), sunlight reflected from the planet (&lt;5 K), and charged particle bombardment (&lt;2 K). This is a trait shared with Io, although for different reasons.

=== Named geological features === 
There are four named geological features on Amalthea: two craters and two (bright spots). The faculae are located on the edge of a ridge on the anti-Jupiter side of Amalthea.

Craters are named after characters in Greek mythology associated with Zeus and Amalthea, and faculae are named after locations associated with Zeus.

== Relationship with Jupiter&#x27;s rings ==
Due to tidal force from Jupiter and Amalthea&#x27;s low density and irregular shape, the escape velocity at its surface points closest to and furthest from Jupiter is no more than 1 m/s, and dust can easily escape from it after, for example, micrometeorite impacts; this dust forms the Amalthea Gossamer Ring.

During its flyby of Amalthea, the &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter&#x27;s star scanner detected nine flashes that appeared to be small moonlets near the orbit of Amalthea. Because they were sighted only from one location, their true distances could not be measured. These moonlets may be anywhere in size from gravel to stadium-sized. Their origins are unknown, but they may be gravitationally captured into the current orbit or they may be ejecta from meteor impacts on Amalthea. On the next and final orbit (just an hour before destruction), &quot;Galileo&quot; detected one more such moonlet. However, this time Amalthea was on the other side of the planet, so it is probable that the particles form a ring around the planet near Amalthea&#x27;s orbit.

== Views to and from Amalthea ==
From Jupiter&#x27;s &quot;surface&quot;—or rather, from just above its cloudtops—Amalthea would appear very bright, shining with a magnitude of −4.7, similar to that of Venus from Earth. At only 5 arcminutes across, its disc would be barely discernible. Amalthea&#x27;s orbital period is only slightly longer than its parent planet&#x27;s day (about 20% in this case), which means it would cross Jupiter&#x27;s sky very slowly. The time between moonrise and moonset would be over 29 hours.

Science journalist Willy Ley suggested Amalthea as a base for observing Jupiter, because of its nearness to the planet, almost-synchronous orbit, and small size making a landing easy. From the surface of Amalthea, Jupiter would look enormous: at 46 degrees across, it would appear roughly 85 times wider than the full moon from Earth. Because Amalthea is in synchronous rotation, Jupiter would not appear to move, and would not be visible from one side of Amalthea. The Sun would disappear behind Jupiter&#x27;s bulk for an hour and a half each revolution, and Amalthea&#x27;s short rotation period gives it just under six hours of . Though Jupiter would appear 900 times brighter than the full moon, its light would be spread over an area some 8,500 times greater and it would not look as bright per surface unit.

== Exploration ==
In 1979, the unmanned &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; space probes obtained the first images of Amalthea to resolve its surface features. They also measured the visible and infrared spectra and surface temperature. Later, the &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter completed the imaging of Amalthea&#x27;s surface. &quot;Galileo&quot; made its final satellite fly-by at a distance of approximately from Amalthea&#x27;s center (at a height of about 160–170 km) on 5 November 2002, permitting the moon&#x27;s mass to be accurately determined, while changing &quot;Galileo&#x27;s&quot; trajectory so that it would plunge into Jupiter in September 2003 at the end of its mission. In 2006, Amalthea&#x27;s orbit was refined with measurements from &quot;New Horizons&quot;.

== In fiction ==
Amalthea is the setting of several works of science fiction, including stories by Arthur C. Clarke, James Blish, and Arkady and Boris Strugatsky.

<text>In Greek mythology, Amalthea or Amaltheia () is the figure most commonly identified as the nurse of Zeus during his infancy. She is described either as a nymph who raises the child on the milk of a goat, or, in some accounts from the Hellenistic period onwards, as the goat itself.

As early as the archaic period, there exist references to the &quot;horn of Amalthea&quot; (known in Latin as the cornucopia), a magical horn said to be capable of producing endless amounts of any food or drink desired. In a narrative attributed to the mythical poet Musaeus, and likely dating to the 4th century BC or earlier, Amalthea, a nymph, nurses the infant Zeus and owns a goat which is terrifying in appearance. After Zeus reaches adulthood, he uses the goat&#x27;s skin as a weapon in his battle against the Titans. Amalthea is first described as a goat by the 3rd-century BC poet Callimachus, who presents a rationalised version of the myth, in which Zeus is fed on Amalthea&#x27;s milk. Aratus, also writing in the 3rd century BC, identifies Amalthea with the star Capella, and describes her as &quot;Olenian&quot; (the meaning of which is unclear).

There is disagreement among scholars as to when the tale of Zeus&#x27;s upbringing was first merged with that of the magical horn. The first author to explicitly combine them is the Roman poet Ovid (1st century BC/AD), whose story of Zeus&#x27;s nursing weaves together elements from multiple earlier accounts. A passage from a scholium (or commentary) on Aratus&#x27;s account has been taken as evidence that the two myths may have been connected prior to Ovid. Another version of Zeus&#x27;s childhood is found in the 2nd-century AD &quot;Fabulae&quot;, in which Amalthea hides the infant in a tree and gathers the Kouretes to dance noisily, so that the child&#x27;s crying cannot be heard. Other accounts of Zeus&#x27;s upbringing describe Amalthea as being related to Melisseus, the king of Crete, including an Orphic version of the story.

Among the relatively few surviving representations of Amalthea in ancient art are a 2nd-century AD marble relief which depicts her as a nymph feeding Zeus out of a large cornucopia, and multiple coins and medallions from the Roman Empire. In modern art, she has been the subject of 17th- and 18th-century works by sculptors such as Gian Lorenzo Bernini and Pierre Julien and painters such as Jacob Jordaens.

==Etymology and origins==
The etymology of () is unknown. While 19th-century scholars proposed various derivations, these were dismissed in the early 20th century by Alfred Chilton Pearson, who suggested that the name may be related to (, ) and (, ). The verb (, ), previously attested only by the &quot;Lexicon&quot; of Hesychius of Alexandria (5th or 6th century AD) and the &quot;Etymologicum Magnum&quot; (12th century AD), was thought by Otto Gruppe in 1906 to derive from Amalthea&#x27;s name; Gruppe&#x27;s suggestion was refuted by the word&#x27;s discovery in a fragment, published the following year, from the writings of the 5th-century BC tragedian Sophocles. According to Pearson, the two words should instead be understood as having existed alongside each other, with this notion of &quot;abundance&quot; or &quot;plenty&quot; being embodied in certain mythological figures.

In Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, an 8th-century BC poem which contains the earliest known account of Zeus&#x27;s birth, there is no mention of Amalthea. Hesiod, does, however, describe the newborn Zeus as being taken to a cave on &quot;the Aegean mountain&quot; in Crete, which some scholars interpret as meaning &quot;Goat&#x27;s Mountain&quot;, seen as a reference to the story of Amalthea; Richard Wyatt Hutchinson takes this term as possible indication that the tradition in which Amalthea is a goat, though only attested from the Hellenistic period, may have existed earlier than that of her as a nymph. Other scholars, however, including M. L. West, see no reason to view Hesiod&#x27;s name for the mountain as a reference to Amalthea. According to Lewis Richard Farnell, Amalthea may have been associated, at some point early on, with the Cretan goddess Dictynna, whose name is likely related to Mount Dicte (sometimes considered the birthplace of Zeus).

== Mythology ==
=== Horn of Amalthea ===

The &quot;horn of Amalthea&quot;, referred to in Latin literature as the cornucopia, is a magical horn generally described as being able to produce an inexhaustible supply of any food or drink desired. The tale of this horn seems to have originated as an independent tradition to the raising of Zeus, though it is uncertain when the two merged. The &quot;horn of Amalthea&quot; is mentioned as early as the archaic period by poets such as Anacreon and Phocylides (who both date to the 6th century BC), and is commonly referenced in comedies, such as those by Cratinus (5th century BC) and Aristophanes (5th to early 4th centuries BC). According to the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; of Apollodorus, the 5th-century BC mythographer Pherecydes described the horn&#x27;s ability to provide endless food and drink as desired, and considered it to belong to the nymph Amalthea. In a lost poem by the 5th-century BC poet Pindar, Heracles fought against the river-god Achelous (who battled him in the form of a bull) for the hand of Deianeira, and during the fight Heracles pulled off one of Achelous&#x27;s horns; the god then reclaimed his horn by trading it for the magical horn which he obtained from Amalthea, a daughter of Oceanus. In the same passage in which he cites Pherecydes, Apollodorus (1st to 2nd centuries AD) retells this story, and describes the nymph Amalthea as the daughter of Haemonius, whose name, meaning &quot;Thessalian&quot;, indicates that this Amalthea is separate to the nurse of Zeus. In Apollodorus&#x27;s account, Amalthea&#x27;s horn is that of a bull (an element also mentioned by the 4th-to-3rd-century BC poet Philemon), seemingly a result of confusion with the bull&#x27;s horn of Achelous, while in other versions of the myth, told by Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC) and Strabo (1st century BC/AD), the horn of Amalthea is identified with that of Achelous.

=== Nurse of Zeus ===
Amalthea is the figure most commonly described as the nurse of Zeus during his infancy, and in this role is often considered to be a nymph. In the account of Zeus&#x27;s upbringing from the now lost work &quot;Eumolpia&quot; (likely composed in or before the 4th century BC), which was attributed in antiquity to the mythical poet Musaeus, Amalthea was the nurse of the young Zeus, and a nymph. According to a summary of the &quot;Catasterismi&quot; of Eratosthenes (written by an author referred to as &quot;Pseudo-Eratosthenes&quot;), in the account attributed to Musaeus, Zeus&#x27;s mother Rhea gave him as a newborn child to Themis, who handed him over to the nymph Amalthea, who had the infant nursed by a she-goat. Pseudo-Eratosthenes goes on to relate that this goat was the daughter of Helios, and was so terrifying in appearance that the Titans, out of fear, asked Gaia to hide her in a cave on Crete; Gaia complied, entrusting the goat to Amalthea. After Zeus reaches adulthood, he receives an oracle advising him to use the goat&#x27;s skin as a weapon in his war against the Titans (due to its terrifying nature). According to the &quot;De astronomia&quot; (a work of astral mythology likely composed in the 2nd-century AD), which similarly recounts the narrative from Musaeus, this weapon which Zeus uses against the Titans is the aegis.

Various accounts of Zeus&#x27;s upbringing rationalise Amalthea as a goat; these versions start appearing in the Hellenistic period. The first author to describe her as a goat seems to have been the 3rd-century BC poet Callimachus, who relates that, after Zeus&#x27;s birth, the god is taken by the Arcadian nymph Neda to a hidden location in Crete, where he is reared by the nymph Adrasteia, and fed the milk of Amalthea. In his description of Zeus suckling Amalthea&#x27;s breast, Callimachus employs the word (), which typically denotes the breast of a human (rather than the teat of a goat), thereby, according to Susan Stephens, &quot;call[ing] attention to his own rationalizing variant of the myth&quot;. According to a scholium (or commentary) on Callimachus&#x27;s account, from one of Amalthea&#x27;s horns flows ambrosia, and from the other comes nectar. In the version of Zeus&#x27;s infancy from Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC), the child is reared by nymphs (who are not named) on the milk of the goat Amalthea, as well as honey, and adds that Amalthea is the source of Zeus&#x27;s epithet (, ). An account which is largely the same as that given by Pseudo-Eratosthenes is found in a scholium on the &quot;Iliad&quot;, though the scholiast describes Amalthea herself as the goat whose hide Zeus uses in his fight against the Titans (rather than the owner of the goat).

In Greek works of astral mythology, the tale of the goat who nurses the young Zeus is adapted to provide an aition (or origin myth) for certain stars. The 3rd-century BC poet Aratus, in his description of the constellation of the Charioteer (Auriga) and the surrounding stars, explains that the star of the Goat (Capella) sits above the Charioteer&#x27;s left shoulder. He identifies this goat with Amalthea, describing it as the goat who suckled the young Zeus; in this passage, he employs the word for the goat&#x27;s breast, similarly to Callimachus, who may be his source for this information. He also states that the &quot;interpreters of Zeus&quot; refer to her as the Olenian goat, which may be an allusion to a version in which Zeus is reared, by a goat, near Olenos in Achaea, or to the location of the star, on the arm (, ) of Auriga; alternatively, it may indicate that the Goat&#x27;s father is Olenus (the son of Hephaestus), an interpretation given by a scholium on the passage. At the end of the account given by Pseudo-Eratosthenes, the text contains a lacuna (or gap), where he would have described Zeus placing the goat among the stars; in the &quot;Catasterismi&quot;, the god would have performed this action for her role in his defeat of the Titans, and her nursing of him during his youth.

=== Merging of traditions ===
According to Robert Fowler, the nursing of Zeus by a goat and the originally independent tradition of the magical horn had become &quot;entangled&quot; by the time of Pherecydes; Jan N. Bremmer, however, states that it was not until Ovid (who was active around the beginning of the 1st century AD) that the two tales were brought together. In Ovid&#x27;s account, presented in his &quot;Fasti&quot;, Amalthea is once again the owner of the goat, and is described as a naiad who lives on Mount Ida. She hides the young Zeus in Crete (away from his father, Cronus), where he is suckled by the she-goat. On one occasion, the goat snaps off one of its horns on a tree, and Amalthea, filling the broken horn with fruit, brings it back to the young Zeus; this tale, an aition for the cornucopia, appears to be the earliest attempt at providing an origin for the object. Zeus later places the goat (and perhaps her broken-off horn) in the heavens, with the goat becoming the star Capella. Ovid&#x27;s narrative brings together elements from multiple earlier accounts, which he intertwines in an episode characterised by John Miller as a &quot;miniature masterpiece&quot;. His source for the narrative&#x27;s overall outline appears to be Eratosthenes: he describes Amalthea as a nymph, and seemingly alludes to Zeus&#x27;s war with the Titans, though he notably departs from the Eratosthenic story by describing the goat as &#x27;beautiful&#x27; () and possessing majestic horns. Ovid harks back to Aratus&#x27;s account in the first words of his narrative, which mirror the opening phrase of the Aratean story, as well as through his description of the goat as &quot;Olenian&quot;. Barbara Boyd also sees in Ovid&#x27;s narrative significant influence from the Callimachean account of Zeus&#x27;s infancy.

Though Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Fasti&quot; is the first known source to clearly narratively merge the tradition of Zeus&#x27;s upbringing with that of Amalthea&#x27;s magical horn, Miller points to a (somewhat garbled) scholium on Aratus as evidence that the two tales may have already been connected by the time of Ovid. The scholiast, who appears to mix two differing versions, one in which Zeus&#x27;s nurse is an Arcadian woman, and another in which she is a goat, describes the horn of this nurse as being Amalthea&#x27;s horn, which he associates with the constellation of the Goat; Amalthea&#x27;s horn here would seem to be the magical horn of plenty, though the two are not explicitly identified. Miller also points, as possible further evidence of a tradition in which the two tales were connected, to the scholium on Callimachus, whose mention of ambrosia and nectar flowing from the goat&#x27;s horns may have been related to the young Zeus&#x27;s nourishment, and a 2nd-century AD marble relief, which seems to show Amalthea feeding the young Zeus from a large cornucopia.

=== Later versions ===
In the account of Zeus&#x27;s infancy in the &quot;Fabulae&quot; (a mythological handbook attributed to Hyginus, and likely composed in the 2nd century AD), his elder siblings are seemingly not swallowed (as they are in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;), though Rhea still gives Cronus a stone in place of Zeus, which he consumes. Upon realising the deception, Cronus scours the earth for his son, while Hera carries the infant to Crete, where she entrusts him to Amalthea, who appears to be a nymph in this account. To keep Zeus from his father, Amalthea hides him in a cradle, which she places in a tree, such that he &quot;could not be found in the sky, on earth, or on the sea&quot;. To prevent Cronus from hearing the cries of the young child, Amalthea brings together the Kouretes, and hands them shields and spears, which she instructs them to clang noisily around where the child lies. According to Martin Nilsson, this account is likely not the creation of Hyginus himself, and probably has some basis in an association of the young Zeus with tree worship. Later in the work, Hyginus mentions , which M. L. West interprets as referring to Amalthea, and describes her as one the daughters of Ocean (here seemingly meaning Oceanus), alongside Adrasteia and Ida. He adds that these three are alternatively considered daughters of Melisseus, the king of Crete, and nurses of Zeus.
Other versions of Zeus&#x27;s upbringing also describe Amalthea as being related to Melisseus, the king of Crete. In the account given by the late-1st-century BC writer Didymus, the infant Zeus is raised by the nymphs Amalthea and Melissa, the daughters of Melisseus, who feed him honey and the milk of a goat. In Apollodorus&#x27;s version of Zeus&#x27;s infancy, the god is born in a cave on Cretan Mount Dicte, where he is fed on the milk of Amalthea; he is raised by the nymphs Adrasteia and Ida, the daughters of Melisseus, and protected by the Kouretes, who noisily clang their spears and shields. Similarly, in the &quot;De astronomia&quot;, Amalthea is the she-goat who suckles Jupiter (the Roman equivalent of Zeus), and she is owned by his nurses, the daughters of Melisseus. Amalthea also seems to have been associated with Melisseus in the now lost Orphic Rhapsodies, a 1st-century BC or 1st-century AD poem which was attributed to the mythical poet Orpheus in antiquity. Luc Brisson and M. L. West write that, in the poem, Amalthea was the wife of Melisseus (a detail transmitted by the 5th-century AD Neoplatonist philosopher Hermias), and that her daughters by him, the nymphs Adrasteia and Ida, raised the young Zeus in the cave of Night, while the Kouretes guarded the entrance of the cave. In &#x27;s reconstruction of the poem, however, Zeus is raised by the nymphs Adrasteia and Ida (still the daughters of Melisseus), and is fed on the milk of Amalthea, whom Bernabé describes as a &quot;goat-nymph&quot; (). An Orphic work may have been the source for the version of Zeus&#x27;s upbringing told by Apollodorus.

Diodorus Siculus, in a euhemerist reworking of Amalthea&#x27;s myth, describes her as an especially beautiful young woman, who is wed to Ammon, the king of Libya; Ammon gifts to her a region of great fertility, which is the shape of a bull&#x27;s horn, and which, taking its name from her, comes to be known as &quot;Amalthea&#x27;s Horn&quot;. In this version, Amalthea and Ammon are also described as the parents of Dionysus. The 1st-century BC Roman writer Cicero, in a letter to his friend Atticus, mentions an , which was likely some form of shrine to Amalthea; on his estate, Atticus had such a shrine, within which were illustrations of Amalthea&#x27;s mythology, and Cicero, seeking to erect a similar structure on his land in Arpinum, requests that Atticus provide him details of his own shrine and of Amalthea&#x27;s mythology. In a version from the 2nd-century AD Greek writer Zenobius, when Zeus places the goat from his childhood among the stars (as the constellation known as the &quot;heavenly goat&quot;), he sets aside one of her horns, which he gifts to the nymphs who raised him. The &quot;De astronomia&quot;, after its account of Jupiter&#x27;s upbringing, states that, alongside Jupiter, the goat Amalthea also raises Aegipan (), and Nonnus, a 5th-century AD Greek writer, describes Pan as the shepherd of the goat Amalthea.

== Iconography ==
There are relatively few surviving depictions of Amalthea in ancient Greek and Roman art. On a marble relief, which likely dates to the 2nd century AD, she is shown as a nymph, holding a large cornucopia out to the young Zeus, from which the infant eats. The scene also includes a young Pan playing a syrinx, two goats, and an eagle and a snake sitting in a tree. In this representation, Miller sees a number of parallels with Ovid&#x27;s narrative, and he points to the relief as evidence that Amalthea&#x27;s horn may have been part of the myth of Zeus&#x27;s upbringing prior to Ovid, suggesting that Ovid and the artist who produced the relief may have been working from a shared source. There exist several other representations of Amalthea as a nymph, though she is more commonly depicted as a goat. As a goat, she is often shown suckling the young Zeus, or with the child mounted upon her back. Amalthea is also found on coins and medallions from the Roman Empire, including those from the reigns of Titus and Gallienus.

== Other representations ==
In the Book of Job in the Septuagint (dated to around the 2nd century BC), the name of the youngest daughter of Job, Keren-happuch, is rendered as (, ), a name which the Roman author Pliny the Elder explicitly identifies with the cornucopia. In the 4th-century AD, the Christian bishop Gregory of Nyssa writes that the text&#x27;s usage of this term should not be taken as reason to believe in the mythical Greek tale of Amalthea, but that it is the text&#x27;s way of emphasising the virtuous character and beautiful appearance of Job&#x27;s daughter.
In modern art, Amalthea was the subject of a sculpture by the Baroque sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini, which was among his first works, having been produced in 1615 or earlier. The work depicts Amalthea as a goat, and shows the infant Jupiter drinking her milk, accompanied by a young satyr, and was for some time thought to have been produced in antiquity. The work, which was acquired by Scipione Borghese in 1615, may have served a political purpose; it may have been used by the Borghese family as a way of portraying the appointment of Pope Paul V as ushering in a &quot;new Golden Age&quot;, represented by the mythical figure of Amalthea, who personified abundance. The myth of the goat Amalthea was a common subject for the Flemish painter Jacob Jordaens, whose paintings of the scene in some cases included elements such as a satyr playing a flute or tambourine, or a nymph holding a milk pitcher looking while at the audience. A print by Schelte a Bolswert, after one of Jordaens&#x27; paintings of Amalthea, is accompanied by an inscription which presents a moral interpretation of the myth, explaining that Jupiter&#x27;s adulterous ways are unsurprising, given he is raised by a goat and satyrs, an upbringing which leads him to emulate a &quot;goat&#x27;s nature&quot;. Around 1786 to 1787, the French sculptor Pierre Julien produced a work depicting Amalthea as a nymph, covered in drapery and accompanied by a goat; when the sculpture was exhibited in 1791, it received high praise, attracting comparison from one critic with the classical Greek sculptures of Praxiteles and Phidias. Julien also produced a relief in which Amalthea is a she-goat, which depicts, in addition to the young Jupiter and several nymphs, a number of Corybantes shown dancing raucously.

<doc id="47253" wikidata="Q269619" url="?curid=47253" title="Richeza of Lotharingia">
<text>Richeza of Lotharingia (also called &quot;Richenza&quot;, &quot;Rixa&quot;, &quot;Ryksa&quot;; born about 995/1000 – 21 March 1063) was a member of the Ezzonen dynasty who became queen of Poland as the wife of Mieszko II Lambert. Her Polish marriage was arranged to strengthen the ties between Mieszko and her uncle Emperor Otto III. She returned to Germany following the deposition of her husband in 1031, either divorcing or separating from him. Upon the death of her brother Duke Otto II of Swabia and the consequent extinction of the male line of her family, Richeza became a nun, worked to preserve the Ezzonen heritage, and funded the restoration of the Abbey of Brauweiler. She has been beatified.

== Family and betrothal ==

She was the eldest daughter of Count Palatine Ezzo of Lotharingia by his wife, Matilda, daughter of Emperor Otto II and Empress Theophanu. Richeza&#x27;s parents were married in 993. Polish historian Kazimierz Jasiński supposed that she was few years younger than her husband Mieszko II Lambert.

In 1000 during the Congress of Gniezno, an agreement was apparently made between Bolesław the Brave and Richeza&#x27;s uncle Emperor Otto III. Among the usual political talks, they decided to strengthen ties through marriage. Otto&#x27;s childlessness meant that the seven daughters of his sister Mathilde (the only of Otto II&#x27;s daughters who married and produced children) were the potential brides for Mieszko, Bolesław I&#x27;s son and heir; the oldest of Otto III&#x27;s nieces, Richeza, was chosen. However, Otto&#x27;s unexpected death in 1002, the reorientation of the Holy Roman Empire politics by his successor, Henry II, and wars between Henry and Bolesław led to the delay of the wedding. The Emperor took the opportunity of a settlement with the Ezzonen family and in Merseburg negotiated a temporary peace with Poland. The marriage between Mieszko and Richeza took place in Merseburg, probably during the Pentecost festivities.

==Queenship==

After the final peace agreement between the Holy Roman Empire and Poland, which was signed in 1018 in Bautzen, Richeza and Mieszko maintained close contact with the German court. In 1021 they participated in the consecration of part of the Bamberg Cathedral.

Bolesław I the Brave died on 17 June 1025. Six months later, on Christmas Day, Mieszko II Lambert and Richeza were crowned king and queen of Poland by the archbishop of Gniezno, Hipolit, in the Gniezno Cathedral. Mieszko&#x27;s reign was short-lived: in 1031, the invasion of both German and Kievan troops forced him to escape to Bohemia, where he was imprisoned and castrated by orders of Duke Oldrich. Mieszko II&#x27;s half-brother Bezprym took the government of Poland and began a cruel persecution of the followers of the former king. The Brauweiler Chronicle indicated that soon after the escape of her husband, Richeza and her children fled to Germany with the Polish regalia, which were given to Emperor Conrad II. She subsequently played an important role in mediating a peace settlement between Poland and the Holy Roman Empire. However, modern historians discount this account.

Richeza and Mieszko II never reunited; according to some sources, they were either officially divorced or separated. After Bezprym was murdered in 1032, Mieszko II was released from captivity and returned to Poland, but was forced to divide the country between himself, his brother Otto and their cousin Dytryk. One year later (1033), after Otto was killed and Dytryk expelled from the country, Mieszko II reunited Poland under his domain. However, his rule lasted only one year: on 10 or 11 July 1034, Mieszko II died suddenly, probably killed as a result of a conspiracy.

Richeza&#x27;s son Casimir was at that time at the court of her brother Archbishop Hermann II of Cologne. In 1037 Casimir returned to Poland in order to claim the throne; apparently, Richeza also returned with him, although this is disputed. Soon after, a barons&#x27; rebellion — coupled with the so-called &quot;Pagan Reaction&quot; of the commoners — forced both Casimir and Richeza to flee to Germany again. She never returned.

== Return to Germany ==

The return of Richeza to Germany forced a redistribution of her father&#x27;s inheritance because at the previous arrangement, it was not contemplated that Richeza would need a place to live. She received Saalfeld, a possession that did not belong to the Lower Rhine area in which the Ezzonen dynasty tried to build a coherent dominion. Richeza still called herself queen of Poland, a privilege that was given to her by the emperor. In Saalfeld she led the Polish opposition that supported her son Casimir, who in 1039, with the help of Conrad II, finally obtained the Polish throne. During the years 1040–1047, Richeza lived in Klotten in the Moselle region.

On 7 September 1047 Richeza&#x27;s brother Duke Otto II of Swabia, the last male representative of the Ezzonen dynasty, died, and with him the territorial and political objectives of his family. Richeza now inherited large parts of the Ezzonen possessions.

Otto&#x27;s death seems to have touched Richeza. At his funeral in Brauweiler, according to Bruno of Toul (later Pope Leo IX), she put her fine jewellery on the altar. She declared that she would spend the rest of her life as a nun to preserve the memory of the Ezzonen dynasty. Another goal was probably to secure the remaining Ezzonen rights.

A charter dated 17 July 1051 noted that Richeza participated in the reorganization of the Ezzonen properties. Her sister Theophanu, Abbess of Essen, and her brother, Hermann II, Archbishop of Cologne and Richeza transferred the Abbey of Brauweiler to the Archdiocese of Cologne. This created a dispute with the Emperor, as this transfer had already occurred under the reign of Ezzo. This was successfully challenged by Ezzo&#x27;s surviving children. The reason for the transfer was likely that the future wasn&#x27;t secured for the descendants of the Ezzonen: From Ezzo&#x27;s ten children, only Richeza and Otto had children. None of these children was in a position of real power over the Ezzonen inheritance. The transfer to the diocese, headed by Hermann II with one of the younger Ezzonen, ensured the cohesion of the property. In 1054 in connection with some donations to the Abbey of Brauweiler, Richeza expressed her desire to be buried there beside her mother. This reorganization, which apparently emanated from the hope that Hermann II would survive his siblings, failed because he died in 1056. The Archbishop of Cologne, Anno II, tried to increase the power of his diocese at the expense of the Ezzonen.

Richeza responded to Anno II&#x27;s ambitions with the formal renunciation of her possessions in Brauweiler to the monastery of Moselle, while reserving the lifelong use of the lands. Brauweiler was the center of Ezzonen memory and she wanted it protected regardless of the economic position of the family. Then Richeza went to Saalfeld, where she found similar arrangements in favour of the Diocese of Würzburg. Anno II protested against these regulations unsuccessfully. In the end, Richeza only maintained direct rule over the towns of Saalfeld and Coburg, but retained the right to use until her death seven other locations in the Rhineland with their additional incomes, and 100 silver pounds per year by the Archdiocese of Cologne. Richeza died on 21 March 1063 in Saalfeld.

==Heritage==
Richeza was buried in Cologne&#x27;s church of St. Maria ad Gradus and not, as she had wished, in Brauweiler. This was prompted by Archbishop Anno II, who appealed to an oral agreement with Richeza. The Klotten estate donated her funeral arrangements to St. Maria ad Gradus, whose relationship with Richeza, Hermann II and Anno II is unclear. Possibly St. Maria ad Gradus was an unfinished work of Richeza&#x27;s brother and completed by Anno II, who wanted to secure part of the Ezzonen patrimony in this way. The Brauweiler Abbey claimed the validity of the 1051 charter and demanded the remains of the Polish Queen.

The dispute ended in 1090 when the then-current archbishop of Cologne, Hermann III, ruled in favour of the monastery of Brauweiler. However, Richeza&#x27;s grave remained in St. Maria ad Gradus until 1816, when it was transferred to Cologne Cathedral. Her grave was placed in the chapel dedicated to St. John the Baptist in a classic wooden sarcophagus. Beside the coffin hang two medieval portraits of Richeza and Anno II that originate from the medieval grave in St. Maria ad Gradus.

Her grave was opened multiple times after the transfer to Cologne Cathedral. The last opening was in 1959 and revealed her bones. According to witnesses, Richeza had a small and graceful stature. Her collarbone showed traces of a fracture. Richeza&#x27;s relics were located in St. Nicholas church in Brauweiler and were moved to the Klotter parish church in 2002.

==Marriage and issue==
Richeza and Mieszko had: 
* Richeza (born 1013) - married Béla I of Hungary
* Casimir (born 1016) - Duke of Poland
* Gertruda (born 1025), married Grand Prince Iziaslav I of Kiev
* possibly Agatha, wife of Edward the Exile, whose origins are unknown. One theory that has been put forward is that she was the daughter of Mieszko II and Richeza.

==Legacy==

The most important of Richeza&#x27;s projects was the rebuilding of the Abbey of Brauweiler. Her parents had founded Brauweiler, but the original church was modestly furnished, which was incompatible with the dynasty&#x27;s territorial objectives. After Otto&#x27;s death, Richeza decided to make Brauweiler the centre of Ezzonen memory. Since the original building didn&#x27;t suit this purpose, Richeza built a new abbey, which remains in good condition. When the construction began a three-aisled pillared basilica was planned with a projecting transept to the east apse across a crypt. The aisles were groined vaults with flat ceilings in the central nave. Inside, the nave had five , each of which was half as large as the square crossing. Throughout the Abbey the cross-vaulted ceiling could be seen (for example in the aisles, pillars or the crypt), which can be found in many Ezzonen buildings. The crypt was consecrated on 11 December 1051. The rest of the construction was consecrated on 30 October 1063, seven months after Richeza&#x27;s death.

The building has distinct references to the Church of St. Maria im Kapitol in Cologne, founded by Richeza&#x27;s sister Ida. Both crypts are laid out identically, the two bays in Brauweiler, however, were shorter. In the upper church, there are clear references. Brauweiler is seen as a copy of the Cologne Cathedral, probably thanks to the influence of Richeza&#x27;s brother Hermann II, who in 1040 consecrated Stavelot Abbey. Richeza planned to make Brauweiler the Ezzonen family crypt, in 1051 interring the remains of her sister Adelaide, Abbess of Nivelles. In 1054 she transferred the remains of her father from Augsburg to be buried next to her sister.

The Gospel Book of Queen Richeza (today in possession of the Universitäts- und Landesbibliothek Darmstadt), comes from St. Maria ad Gradus, where Richeza had a space reserved in the central nave, normally occupied by the Donors. It is not clear whether this was done at the behest of Anno II, or by Richeza. An indication of the latter thesis, however, is the Gospel Book. The manuscript is made of 153 pages in the pergamin style in an 18 x 13.5 cm format. In 150 of the pages of the book, a prayer is recorded, which suggests a high-born owner. The following pages contain entries about the Ezzonen memorial. In addition to Richeza, Anno II and her parents were named. The entries can be counted among drawings in the Codex style recognized around 1100. The Codex itself was built around 1040, probably in Maasland, with incomplete ornamentation: the Mark and Luke are drawn completely, but only in a preliminary sketch. Matthew wasn&#x27;t drawn. Another possible indication is the Codex date: After 1047, Richeza took her monastic vows and had no need for a personal representative signature. It is unknown whether it remained in her possession and was used together with other relics of Anno II from her estate of St. Maria ad Gradus, or had already been donated to her brother before her death.

<doc id="47261" wikidata="Q5347226" url="?curid=47261" title="Effect of taxes and subsidies on price">
<text>Taxes and subsidies change the price of goods and, as a result, the quantity consumed. There is a difference between an ad valorem tax and a specific tax or subsidy in the way it is applied to the price of the good. In the end levying a tax moves the market to a new equilibrium where the price of a good paid by buyers increases and the proportion of the price received by sellers decreases. The incidence of a tax does not depend on whether the buyers or sellers are taxed since taxes levied on sellers are likely to be met by raising the price charged to buyers. Most of the burden of a tax falls on the less elastic side of the market because of a lower ability to respond to the tax by changing the quantity sold or bought. Introduction of a subsidy, on the other hand, may either lowers the price of production which encourages firms to produce more, or lowers the price paid by buyers, encouraging higher sales volume. Such a policy is beneficial both to sellers and buyers.

== Specific tax impact ==
Source:

The effect of a specific tax levied on sellers can be divided into three steps. 

First, the demand for a good is the same for a given price level so the demand curve does not change. On the other hand, the tax makes the good in fact more expensive to produce for the seller. This means that the business is less profitable for a given price level and the supply curve shifts upwards. 

Second, the higher cost of producing the good reduces the quantity supplied at any given price. The upward shifted supply curve is parallel to the original supply curve because no matter the quantity supplied, the seller’s expenses on the production are the same. Therefore the distance between the original and the new shifted supply curve is equal to the amount of tax imposed. Whatever the price of the good, the net price for which the sellers are selling is effectively the gross price less the amount of the tax. This makes the sellers supply the amount of the good as if the price were lower by the amount of the tax. In order for them to supply a given quantity of the good, the market price needs to be higher by the amount of tax to preserve net income from sales. 

Last, after the shift of the supply curve is taken into account, the difference between the initial and after-tax equilibrium can be observed. The growth of market price is determined by the price elasticities of demand and supply. In the case of demand being more elastic than supply, the incidence of the tax falls more heavily on sellers and the consumers feel a smaller growth of price and vice versa. In both cases, the consumers pay more for the good and while the sellers initially receive more money, after the tax is accounted for, they are left with less money than if there were no tax imposed. 

The tax raises the price which the customers pay for the good (unless the absorb the whole tax cost) and lowers the price the producers are effectively selling the good for unless they pass on the whole tax cost. The difference between the two prices remains the same no matter who bears most of the burden of the tax.

=== Example ===
The original equilibrium price is $3.00 and the equilibrium quantity is 100. The government then levies a tax of $0.50 on the sellers. This leads to a new supply curve which is shifted upward by $0.50 compared to the original supply curve. The new equilibrium price will sit between $3.00 and $3.50 and the equilibrium quantity will decrease. If we say that the consumers pay $3.30 and the new equilibrium quantity is 80, then the producers keep $2.80 and the total tax revenue equals $0.50 x 80 = $40.00. The burden of the tax paid by buyers is $0.30 x 80 = $2.40 and the burden paid by sellers equals $0.20 x 80 = $1.60.

== Ad valorem tax impact ==
Source:

Similarly the effect can be broken down into three steps. 

First, the tax again affects the sellers. The quantity demanded at a given price remains unchanged and therefore the demand curve stays the same. Since the tax is a certain percentage of the price, with increasing price, the tax grows as well. The supply curve shifts upward but the new supply curve is not parallel to the original one.

Second, the tax raises the production cost as with the specific tax but the amount of tax varies with price level. The upward shift of the supply curve is accompanied by a pivot upwards and to the left of the original supply curve. The vertical distance between the two supply curves is equal to the amount of tax in per cent. The effective price to the sellers is again lower by the amount of the tax and they will supply the good as if the price were lower by the amount of tax. 

Last, the total impact of the tax can be observed. The equilibrium price of the good rises and the equilibrium quantity decreases. The buyers and sellers again share the burden of the tax relative to their price elasticities. The buyers have to pay more for the good and the sellers receive less money than before the tax has been imposed. 

=== Example ===
The pre-tax equilibrium price is $5.00 with respective equilibrium quantity of 100. The government imposes a 20 per cent tax on the sellers. A new supply curve emerges. It is shifted upward and pivoted to the left and upwards in comparison to the original supply curve and their distance is always 20 per cent of the original price. In the pre-tax equilibrium the distance equals $5.00 x 0.20 = $1.00. This burden of the tax is again shared by the buyer and seller. If the new equilibrium quantity decreases to 85 and the buyer bears a higher proportion of the tax burden (e.g. $0.75), the total amount of tax collected equals $1.00 x 85 = $85.00. The buyer then faces the tax of $0.75 x 85 = $63.75 and the tax paid by the seller equals $0.25 x 85 = $21.25. The price the consumer buys the good for equals $5.75 but the seller only receives $4.75.

== Subsidy impact ==
Marginal subsidies on production will shift the supply curve to the right until the vertical distance between the two supply curves is equal to the per unit subsidy; when other things remain equal, this will decrease price paid by the consumers (which is equal to the new market price) and increase the price received by the producers. Similarly, a marginal subsidy on consumption will shift the demand curve to the right; when other things remain equal, this will decrease the price paid by consumers and increase the price received by producers by the same amount as if the subsidy had been granted to producers. However, in this case, the new market price will be the price received by producers. The end result is that the lower price that consumers pay and the higher price that producers receive will be the same, regardless of how the subsidy is administered.

==Effect of elasticity==
Depending on the price elasticities of demand and supply, who bears more of the tax or who receives more of the subsidy may differ. Where the supply curve is less elastic than the demand curve, producers bear more of the tax and receive more of the subsidy than consumers as the difference between the price producers receive and the initial market price is greater than the difference borne by consumers. Where the demand curve is more inelastic than the supply curve, the consumers bear more of the tax and receive more of the subsidy as the difference between the price consumers pay and the initial market price is greater than the difference borne by producers.

==An illustration==
The effect of this type of tax can be illustrated on a standard supply and demand diagram. Without a tax, the equilibrium price will be at &quot;Pe&quot; and the equilibrium quantity will be at &quot;Qe&quot;.

After a tax is imposed, the price consumers pay will shift to &quot;Pc&quot; and the price producers receive will shift to &quot;Pp&quot;. The consumers&#x27; price will be equal to the producers&#x27; price plus the cost of the tax. Since consumers will buy less at the higher consumer price (&quot;Pc&quot;) and producers will sell less at a lower producer price (&quot;Pp&quot;), the quantity sold will fall from &quot;Qe&quot; to &quot;Qt&quot;.

<doc id="47262" wikidata="Q3002" url="?curid=47262" title="2 Pallas">
<text>Pallas (minor-planet designation: 2 Pallas) is the third-largest asteroid in the Solar System by volume and mass. It is the second asteroid to have been discovered, after Ceres, and is likely a remnant protoplanet. Like Ceres, it is believed to have a mineral composition similar to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, though significantly less hydrated than Ceres. It is 79% the mass of Vesta and 22% the mass of Ceres, constituting an estimated 7% of the mass of the asteroid belt. Its estimated volume is equivalent to a sphere in diameter, 90–95% the volume of Vesta.

During the planetary formation era of the Solar System, objects grew in size through an accretion process to approximately the size of Pallas. Most of these protoplanets were incorporated into the growth of larger bodies, which became the planets, whereas others were ejected by the planets or destroyed in collisions with each other. Pallas, Vesta and Ceres appear to be the only intact bodies from this early stage of planetary formation to survive within the orbit of Neptune.

When Pallas was discovered by the German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers on 28 March 1802, it was considered to be a planet, as were other asteroids in the early 19th century. The discovery of many more asteroids after 1845 eventually led to the separate listing of &quot;minor&quot; planets from &quot;major&quot; planets, and the realization in the 1950s that such small bodies did not form in the same way as (other) planets led to the gradual abandonment of the term &quot;minor planet&quot; in favor of &quot;asteroid&quot; (or, for larger bodies such as Pallas, &quot;planetoid&quot;).

With an orbital inclination of 34.8°, Pallas&#x27;s orbit is unusually highly inclined to the plane of the asteroid belt, making Pallas relatively inaccessible to spacecraft, and its orbital eccentricity is nearly as large as that of Pluto.

The high inclination of the orbit of Pallas results in the possibility of close conjunctions to stars that other solar objects always pass at great angular distance. This resulted in Pallas passing Sirius on 9 October 2022, only 8.5 arcminutes southwards, while no planet can get closer than 30 degrees to Sirius.

== History ==
=== Discovery ===
On the night of 5 April 1779, Charles Messier recorded Pallas on a star chart he used to track the path of a comet, now known as C/1779 A1 (Bode), that he observed in the spring of 1779, but apparently assumed it was nothing more than a star.

In 1801, the astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi discovered an object which he initially believed to be a comet. Shortly thereafter he announced his observations of this object, noting that the slow, uniform motion was uncharacteristic of a comet, suggesting it was a different type of object. This was lost from sight for several months, but was recovered later that year by the Baron von Zach and Heinrich W. M. Olbers after a preliminary orbit was computed by Carl Friedrich Gauss. This object came to be named Ceres, and was the first asteroid to be discovered.

A few months later, Olbers was again attempting to locate Ceres when he noticed another moving object in the vicinity. This was the asteroid Pallas, coincidentally passing near Ceres at the time. The discovery of this object created interest in the astronomy community. Before this point it had been speculated by astronomers that there should be a planet in the gap between Mars and Jupiter. Now, unexpectedly, a second such body had been found. When Pallas was discovered, some estimates of its size were as high as 3,380 km in diameter. Even as recently as 1979, Pallas was estimated to be 673 km in diameter, 26% greater than the currently accepted value.

The orbit of Pallas was determined by Gauss, who found the period of 4.6 years was similar to the period for Ceres. Pallas has a relatively high orbital inclination to the plane of the ecliptic.

=== Later observations ===
In 1917, the Japanese astronomer Kiyotsugu Hirayama began to study asteroid motions. By plotting the mean orbital motion, inclination, and eccentricity of a set of asteroids, he discovered several distinct groupings. In a later paper he reported a group of three asteroids associated with Pallas, which became named the Pallas family, after the largest member of the group. Since 1994 more than 10 members of this family have been identified, with semi-major axes between 2.50 and 2.82 AU and inclinations of 33–38°. The validity of the family was confirmed in 2002 by a comparison of their spectra.

Pallas has been observed occulting stars several times, including the best-observed of all asteroid occultation events, by 140 observers on 29 May 1983. These measurements resulted in the first accurate calculation of its diameter.
After an occultation on 29 May 1979, the discovery of a possible tiny satellite with a diameter of about 1 km was reported, which was never confirmed.

Radio signals from spacecraft in orbit around Mars and/or on its surface have been used to estimate the mass of Pallas from the tiny perturbations induced by it onto the motion of Mars.

The &quot;Dawn&quot; team was granted viewing time on the Hubble Space Telescope in September 2007 for a once-in-twenty-year opportunity to view Pallas at closest approach, to obtain comparative data for Ceres and Vesta.

=== Name and symbol ===
&quot;Pallas&quot; is an epithet of the Greek goddess Athena (). In some versions of the myth, Athena killed Pallas, daughter of Triton, then adopted her friend&#x27;s name out of mourning.

The adjectival form of the name is &quot;Palladian&quot;. The &quot;d&quot; is part of the oblique stem of the Greek name, which appears before a vowel but disappears before the nominative ending &quot;-s&quot;. The oblique form is seen in the Italian and Russian names for the asteroid, and ().
The stony-iron pallasite meteorites are not Palladian, being named instead after the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas. The chemical element palladium, on the other hand, was named after the asteroid, which had been discovered just before the element.

The old astronomical symbol of Pallas, still used in astrology, is a spear or lance, , one of the symbols of the goddess. The blade was most often a lozenge (), but various graphic variants were published, including an acute/elliptic leaf shape, a cordate leaf shape (: ), and a triangle (); the last made it effectively the alchemical symbol for sulfur, . The generic asteroid symbol of a disk with its discovery number, , was introduced in 1852 and quickly became the norm. The iconic lozenge symbol was resurrected for astrological use in 1973.

== Orbit and rotation ==

Pallas has unusual dynamic parameters for such a large body. Its orbit is highly inclined and moderately eccentric, despite being at the same distance from the Sun as the central part of the asteroid belt. Furthermore, Pallas has a very high axial tilt of 84°, with its north pole pointing towards ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (30°, −16°) with a 5° uncertainty in the Ecliptic J2000.0 reference frame. This means that every Palladian summer and winter, large parts of the surface are in constant sunlight or constant darkness for a time on the order of an Earth year, with areas near the poles experiencing continuous sunlight for as long as two years.

=== Near resonances ===
Pallas is in a near-1:1 orbital resonance with Ceres, which is probably coincidental. Pallas also has a near-18:7 resonance (91,000-year period) and an approximate 5:2 resonance (83-year period) with Jupiter.

=== Transits of planets from Pallas ===
From Pallas, the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Earth can occasionally appear to transit, or pass in front of, the Sun. Earth last did so in 1968 and 1998, and will next transit in 2224. Mercury did in October 2009. The last and next by Venus are in 1677 and 2123, and for Mars they are in 1597 and 2759.
== Physical characteristics ==

Both Vesta and Pallas have assumed the title of second-largest asteroid from time to time. At in diameter, Pallas is slightly smaller than Vesta (). The mass of Pallas is that of Vesta, that of Ceres, and a quarter of one percent that of the Moon.

Pallas is farther from Earth and has a much lower albedo than Vesta, and hence is dimmer as seen from Earth. Indeed, the much smaller asteroid 7 Iris marginally exceeds Pallas in mean opposition magnitude. Pallas&#x27;s mean opposition magnitude is +8.0, which is well within the range of 10×50 binoculars, but, unlike Ceres and Vesta, it will require more-powerful optical aid to view at small elongations, when its magnitude can drop as low as +10.6. During rare perihelic oppositions, Pallas can reach a magnitude of +6.4, right on the edge of naked-eye visibility. During late February 2014 Pallas shone with magnitude 6.96.

Pallas is a B-type asteroid. Based on spectroscopic observations, the primary component of the material on Pallas&#x27;s surface is a silicate containing little iron and water. Minerals of this type include olivine and pyroxene, which are found in CM chondrules. The surface composition of Pallas is very similar to the Renazzo carbonaceous chondrite (CR) meteorites, which are even lower in hydrous minerals than the CM type. The Renazzo meteorite was discovered in Italy in 1824 and is one of the most primitive meteorites known. Pallas&#x27;s visible and near-infrared spectrum is almost flat, being slightly brighter in towards the blue. There is only one clear absorption band in the 3-micron part, which suggests an anhydrous component mixed with hydrated CM-like silicates.

Pallas&#x27;s surface is most likely composed of a silicate material; its spectrum and calculated density () correspond to CM chondrite meteorites (), suggesting a mineral composition similar to that of Ceres, but significantly less hydrated.

To within observational limits, Pallas appears to be saturated with craters. Its high inclination and eccentricity means that average impacts are much more energetic than on Vesta or Ceres (with on average twice their velocity), meaning that smaller (and thus more common) impactors can create equivalently sized craters. Indeed, Pallas appears to have many more large craters than either Vesta or Ceres, with craters larger than 40 km covering at least 9% of its surface.

Pallas&#x27;s shape departs significantly from the dimensions of an equilibrium body at its current rotational period, indicating that it is not a dwarf planet. It&#x27;s possible that a suspected large impact basin at the south pole, which ejected of the volume of Pallas (twice the volume of the Rheasilvia basin on Vesta), may have increased its inclination and slowed its rotation; the shape of Pallas without such a basin would be close to an equilibrium shape for a 6.2-hour rotational period. A smaller crater near the equator is associated with the Palladian family of asteroids.

Pallas probably has a quite homogeneous interior. The close match between Pallas and CM chondrites suggests that they formed in the same era and that the interior of Pallas never reached the temperature (≈820 K) needed to dehydrate silicates, which would be necessary to differentiate a dry silicate core beneath a hydrated mantle. Thus Pallas should be rather homogeneous in composition, though some upward flow of water could have occurred since. Such a migration of water to the surface would have left salt deposits, potentially explaining Pallas&#x27;s relatively high albedo. Indeed, one bright spot is reminiscent of those found on Ceres. Although other explanations for the bright spot are possible (e.g. a recent ejecta blanket), if the near-Earth asteroid 3200 Phaethon is an ejected piece of Pallas, as some have theorized, then a Palladian surface enriched in salts would explain the sodium abundance in the Geminid meteor shower caused by Phaethon.

===Surface features===
Besides one bright spot in the southern hemisphere, the only surface features identified on Pallas are craters. As of 2020, 36 craters have been identified, 34 of which are larger than 40 km in diameter. Provisional names have been provided for some of them. The craters are named after ancient weapons.

== Satellites ==
A small moon about 1 kilometer in diameter was suggested based on occultation data from 29 May 1978. In 1980, speckle interferometry suggested a much larger satellite, whose existence was refuted a few years later with occultation data.

== Exploration ==
Pallas itself has never been visited by spacecraft. Proposals have been made in the past though none have come to fruition. A flyby of the &quot;Dawn&quot; probe&#x27;s visits to 4 Vesta and 1 Ceres was discussed but was not possible due to the high orbital inclination of Pallas. The proposed &quot;Athena&quot; SmallSat mission would have been launched in 2022 as a secondary payload of the &quot;Psyche&quot; mission and travel on separate trajectory to a flyby encounter with 2 Pallas, though was not funded due to being outcompeted by other mission concepts such as the TransOrbital Trailblazer Lunar Orbiter. The authors of the proposal cited Pallas as the &quot;largest unexplored&quot; main-belt protoplanet.

<text>243 Ida is an asteroid in the Koronis family of the asteroid belt. It was discovered on 29 September 1884 by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa at Vienna Observatory and named after a nymph from Greek mythology. Later telescopic observations categorized Ida as an S-type asteroid, the most numerous type in the inner asteroid belt. On 28 August 1993, Ida was visited by the uncrewed &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft while en route to Jupiter. It was the second asteroid visited by a spacecraft and the first found to have a natural satellite.

Ida&#x27;s orbit lies between the planets Mars and Jupiter, like all main-belt asteroids. Its orbital period is 4.84 years, and its rotation period is 4.63 hours. Ida has an average diameter of . It is irregularly shaped and elongated, apparently composed of two large objects connected together. Its surface is one of the most heavily cratered in the Solar System, featuring a wide variety of crater sizes and ages.

Ida&#x27;s moon Dactyl was discovered by mission member Ann Harch in images returned from &quot;Galileo&quot;. It was named after the Dactyls, creatures which inhabited Mount Ida in Greek mythology. Dactyl is only in diameter, about 1/20 the size of Ida. Its orbit around Ida could not be determined with much accuracy, but the constraints of possible orbits allowed a rough determination of Ida&#x27;s density and revealed that it is depleted of metallic minerals. Dactyl and Ida share many characteristics, suggesting a common origin.

The images returned from &quot;Galileo&quot; and the subsequent measurement of Ida&#x27;s mass provided new insights into the geology of S-type asteroids. Before the &quot;Galileo&quot; flyby, many different theories had been proposed to explain their mineral composition. Determining their composition permits a correlation between meteorites falling to the Earth and their origin in the asteroid belt. Data returned from the flyby pointed to S-type asteroids as the source for the ordinary chondrite meteorites, the most common type found on the Earth&#x27;s surface.

== Discovery and observations ==
Ida was discovered on 29 September 1884 by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa at the Vienna Observatory. It was his 45th asteroid discovery. Ida was named by Moriz von Kuffner, a Viennese brewer and amateur astronomer. In Greek mythology, Ida was a nymph of Crete who raised the god Zeus. Ida was recognized as a member of the Koronis family by Kiyotsugu Hirayama, who proposed in 1918 that the group comprised the remnants of a destroyed precursor body.

Ida&#x27;s reflection spectrum was measured on 16 September 1980 by astronomers David J. Tholen and Edward F. Tedesco as part of the eight-color asteroid survey (ECAS). Its spectrum matched those of the asteroids in the S-type classification. Many observations of Ida were made in early 1993 by the US Naval Observatory in Flagstaff and the Oak Ridge Observatory. These improved the measurement of Ida&#x27;s orbit around the Sun and reduced the uncertainty of its position during the &quot;Galileo&quot; flyby from .

== Exploration ==
=== &quot;Galileo&quot; flyby ===
Ida was visited in 1993 by the Jupiter-bound space probe &quot;Galileo&quot;. Its encounters of the asteroids Gaspra and Ida were secondary to the Jupiter mission. These were selected as targets in response to a new NASA policy directing mission planners to consider asteroid flybys for all spacecraft crossing the belt. No prior missions had attempted such a flyby. &quot;Galileo&quot; was launched into orbit by the Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; mission STS-34 on 18 October 1989. Changing &quot;Galileo&#x27;s&quot; trajectory to approach Ida required that it consume of propellant. Mission planners delayed the decision to attempt a flyby until they were certain that this would leave the spacecraft enough propellant to complete its Jupiter mission.

&quot;Galileo&#x27;s&quot; trajectory carried it into the asteroid belt twice on its way to Jupiter. During its second crossing, it flew by Ida on 28 August 1993 at a speed of relative to the asteroid. The onboard imager observed Ida from a distance of to its closest approach of . Ida was the second asteroid, after Gaspra, to be imaged by a spacecraft. About 95% of Ida&#x27;s surface came into view of the probe during the flyby.

Transmission of many Ida images was delayed due to a permanent failure in the spacecraft&#x27;s high-gain antenna. The first five images were received in September 1993. These comprised a high-resolution mosaic of the asteroid at a resolution of 31–38 m/pixel. The remaining images were sent in February 1994, when the spacecraft&#x27;s proximity to the Earth allowed higher speed transmissions.

=== Discoveries ===
The data returned from the &quot;Galileo&quot; flybys of Gaspra and Ida, and the later &quot;NEAR Shoemaker&quot; asteroid mission, permitted the first study of asteroid geology. Ida&#x27;s relatively large surface exhibited a diverse range of geological features. The discovery of Ida&#x27;s moon Dactyl, the first confirmed satellite of an asteroid, provided additional insights into Ida&#x27;s composition.

Ida is classified as an S-type asteroid based on ground-based spectroscopic measurements. The composition of S-types was uncertain before the &quot;Galileo&quot; flybys, but was interpreted to be either of two minerals found in meteorites that had fallen to the Earth: ordinary chondrite (OC) and stony-iron. Estimates of Ida&#x27;s density are constrained to less than 3.2 g/cm3 by the long-term stability of Dactyl&#x27;s orbit. This all but rules out a stony-iron composition; were Ida made of 5 g/cm3 iron- and nickel-rich material, it would have to contain more than 40% empty space.

The Galileo images also led to the discovery that space weathering was taking place on Ida, a process which causes older regions to become more red in color over time. The same process affects both Ida and its moon, although Dactyl shows a lesser change. The weathering of Ida&#x27;s surface revealed another detail about its composition: the reflection spectra of freshly exposed parts of the surface resembled that of OC meteorites, but the older regions matched the spectra of S-type asteroids.Both of these discoveries—the space weathering effects and the low density—led to a new understanding about the relationship between S-type asteroids and OC meteorites. S-types are the most numerous kind of asteroid in the inner part of the asteroid belt. OC meteorites are, likewise, the most common type of meteorite found on the Earth&#x27;s surface. The reflection spectra measured by remote observations of S-type asteroids, however, did not match that of OC meteorites. The &quot;Galileo&quot; flyby of Ida found that some S-types, particularly the Koronis family, could be the source of these meteorites.

== Physical characteristics ==

Ida&#x27;s mass is between 3.65 and 4.99 × 1016 kg. Its gravitational field produces an acceleration of about 0.3 to 1.1 cm/s2 over its surface. This field is so weak that an astronaut standing on its surface could leap from one end of Ida to the other, and an object moving in excess of could escape the asteroid entirely.

Ida is a distinctly elongated asteroid, with an irregular surface. Ida is 2.35 times as long as it is wide, and a &quot;waist&quot; separates it into two geologically dissimilar halves. This constricted shape is consistent with Ida being made of two large, solid components, with loose debris filling the gap between them. However, no such debris was seen in high-resolution images captured by &quot;Galileo&quot;. Although there are a few steep slopes tilting up to about 50° on Ida, the slope generally does not exceed 35°. Ida&#x27;s irregular shape is responsible for the asteroid&#x27;s very uneven gravitational field. The surface acceleration is lowest at the extremities because of their high rotational speed. It is also low near the &quot;waist&quot; because the mass of the asteroid is concentrated in the two halves, away from this location.

== Surface features ==

Ida&#x27;s surface appears heavily cratered and mostly gray, although minor color variations mark newly formed or uncovered areas. Besides craters, other features are evident, such as grooves, ridges, and protrusions. Ida is covered by a thick layer of regolith, loose debris that obscures the solid rock beneath. The largest, boulder-sized, debris fragments are called &quot;ejecta blocks&quot;, several of which have been observed on the surface.

=== Regolith ===
The surface of Ida is covered in a blanket of pulverized rock, called &quot;regolith&quot;, about thick. This material is produced in impact events and redistributed across Ida&#x27;s surface by geological processes. &quot;Galileo&quot; observed evidence of recent downslope regolith movement.

Ida&#x27;s regolith is composed of the silicate minerals olivine and pyroxene. Its appearance changes over time through a process called space weathering. Because of this process, older regolith appears more red in color compared to freshly exposed material.
About 20 large (40–150 m across) ejecta blocks have been identified, embedded in Ida&#x27;s regolith. Ejecta blocks constitute the largest pieces of the regolith. Because ejecta blocks are expected to break down quickly by impact events, those present on the surface must have been either formed recently or uncovered by an impact event. Most of them are located within the craters Lascaux and Mammoth, but they may not have been produced there. This area attracts debris due to Ida&#x27;s irregular gravitational field. Some blocks may have been ejected from the young crater Azzurra on the opposite side of the asteroid.

=== Structures ===
Several major structures mark Ida&#x27;s surface. The asteroid appears to be split into two halves, here referred to as &quot;region 1&quot; and &quot;region 2&quot;, connected by a &quot;waist&quot;. This feature may have been filled in by debris, or blasted out of the asteroid by impacts.

Region 1 of Ida contains two major structures. One is a prominent ridge named &quot;Townsend Dorsum&quot; that stretches 150 degrees around Ida&#x27;s surface. The other structure is a large indentation named &quot;Vienna Regio&quot;.

Ida&#x27;s region 2 features several sets of grooves, most of which are wide or less and up to long. They are located near, but are not connected with, the craters Mammoth, Lascaux, and Kartchner. Some grooves are related to major impact events, for example a set opposite Vienna Regio.

=== Craters ===
Ida is one of the most densely cratered bodies yet explored in the Solar System, and impacts have been the primary process shaping its surface. Cratering has reached the saturation point, meaning that new impacts erase evidence of old ones, leaving the total crater count roughly the same. It is covered with craters of all sizes and stages of degradation, and ranging in age from fresh to as old as Ida itself. The oldest may have been formed during the breakup of the Koronis family parent body. The largest crater, Lascaux, is almost across. Region 2 contains nearly all of the craters larger than in diameter, but Region 1 has no large craters at all. Some craters are arranged in chains.

Ida&#x27;s major craters are named after caves and lava tubes on Earth. The crater Azzurra, for example, is named after a submerged cave on the island of Capri, also known as the &quot;Blue Grotto&quot;. Azzurra seems to be the most recent major impact on Ida. The ejecta from this collision is distributed discontinuously over Ida and is responsible for the large-scale color and albedo variations across its surface. An exception to the crater morphology is the fresh, asymmetric Fingal, which has a sharp boundary between the floor and wall on one side. Another significant crater is Afon, which marks Ida&#x27;s prime meridian.

The craters are simple in structure: bowl-shaped with no flat bottoms and no central peaks. They are distributed evenly around Ida, except for a protrusion north of crater Choukoutien which is smoother and less cratered. The ejecta excavated by impacts is deposited differently on Ida than on planets because of its rapid rotation, low gravity and irregular shape. Ejecta blankets settle asymmetrically around their craters, but fast-moving ejecta that escapes from the asteroid is permanently lost.

== Composition ==
Ida was classified as an S-type asteroid based on the similarity of its reflectance spectra with similar asteroids. S-types may share their composition with stony-iron or ordinary chondrite (OC) meteorites. The composition of the interior has not been directly analyzed, but is assumed to be similar to OC material based on observed surface color changes and Ida&#x27;s bulk density of 2.27–3.10 g/cm3. OC meteorites contain varying amounts of the silicates olivine and pyroxene, iron, and feldspar. Olivine and pyroxene were detected on Ida by &quot;Galileo&quot;. The mineral content appears to be homogeneous throughout its extent. &quot;Galileo&quot; found minimal variations on the surface, and the asteroid&#x27;s spin indicates a consistent density. Assuming that its composition is similar to OC meteorites, which range in density from 3.48 to 3.64 g/cm3, Ida would have a porosity of 11–42%.

Ida&#x27;s interior probably contains some amount of impact-fractured rock, called &quot;megaregolith&quot;. The megaregolith layer of Ida extends between hundreds of meters below the surface to a few kilometers. Some rock in Ida&#x27;s core may have been fractured below the large craters Mammoth, Lascaux, and Undara.

== Orbit and rotation ==

Ida is a member of the Koronis family of asteroid-belt asteroids. Ida orbits the Sun at an average distance of , between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Ida takes 4.84089 years to complete one orbit.

Ida rotates in the retrograde direction with a rotation period of 4.63 hours (roughly 5 hours). The calculated maximum moment of inertia of a uniformly dense object the same shape as Ida coincides with the spin axis of the asteroid. This suggests that there are no major variations of density within the asteroid. Ida&#x27;s axis of rotation precesses with a period of 77 thousand years, due to the gravity of the Sun acting upon the nonspherical shape of the asteroid.

== Origin ==
Ida originated in the breakup of the roughly diameter Koronis parent body. The progenitor asteroid had partially differentiated, with heavier metals migrating to the core. Ida carried away insignificant amounts of this core material. It is uncertain how long ago the disruption event occurred. According to an analysis of Ida&#x27;s cratering processes, its surface is more than a billion years old. However, this is inconsistent with the estimated age of the Ida–Dactyl system of less than 100 million years; it is unlikely that Dactyl, due to its small size, could have escaped being destroyed in a major collision for longer. The difference in age estimates may be explained by an increased rate of cratering from the debris of the Koronis parent body&#x27;s destruction.

== Dactyl ==


Ida has a moon named Dactyl, official designation (243) Ida I Dactyl. It was discovered in images taken by the &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft during its flyby in 1993. These images provided the first direct confirmation of an asteroid moon. At the time, it was separated from Ida by a distance of , moving in a prograde orbit. Dactyl is heavily cratered, like Ida, and consists of similar materials. Its origin is uncertain, but evidence from the flyby suggests that it originated as a fragment of the Koronis parent body.

=== Discovery ===
Dactyl was found on 17 February 1994 by &quot;Galileo&quot; mission member Ann Harch, while examining delayed image downloads from the spacecraft. &quot;Galileo&quot; recorded 47 images of Dactyl over an observation period of 5.5 hours in August 1993. The spacecraft was from Ida and from Dactyl when the first image of the moon was captured, 14 minutes before &quot;Galileo&quot; made its closest approach.

Dactyl was initially designated 1993 (243) 1. It was named by the International Astronomical Union in 1994, for the mythological dactyls who inhabited Mount Ida on the island of Crete.

=== Physical characteristics ===
Dactyl is an &quot;egg-shaped&quot; but &quot;remarkably spherical&quot; object measuring . It is oriented with its longest axis pointing towards Ida. Like Ida, Dactyl&#x27;s surface exhibits saturation cratering. It is marked by more than a dozen craters with a diameter greater than , indicating that the moon has suffered many collisions during its history. At least six craters form a linear chain, suggesting that it was caused by locally produced debris, possibly ejected from Ida. Dactyl&#x27;s craters may contain central peaks, unlike those found on Ida. These features, and Dactyl&#x27;s spheroidal shape, imply that the moon is gravitationally controlled despite its small size. Like Ida, its average temperature is about .

Dactyl shares many characteristics with Ida. Their albedos and reflection spectra are very similar. The small differences indicate that the space weathering process is less active on Dactyl. Its small size would make the formation of significant amounts of regolith impossible. This contrasts with Ida, which is covered by a deep layer of regolith.

The two largest imaged craters on Dactyl were named Acmon and Celmis , after two of the mythological dactyls. Acmon is the largest crater in the above image, and Celmis is near the bottom of the image, mostly obscured in shadow. The craters are 300 and 200 meters in diameter, respectively.

=== Orbit ===

Dactyl&#x27;s orbit around Ida is not precisely known. &quot;Galileo&quot; was in the plane of Dactyl&#x27;s orbit when most of the images were taken, which made determining its exact orbit difficult. Dactyl orbits in the prograde direction and is inclined about 8° to Ida&#x27;s equator. Based on computer simulations, Dactyl&#x27;s pericenter must be more than about from Ida for it to remain in a stable orbit. The range of orbits generated by the simulations was narrowed down by the necessity of having the orbits pass through points at which &quot;Galileo&quot; observed Dactyl to be at 16:52:05 UT on 28 August 1993, about from Ida at longitude 85°. On 26 April 1994, the Hubble Space Telescope observed Ida for eight hours and was unable to spot Dactyl. It would have been able to observe it if it were more than about from Ida.

If in a circular orbit at the distance at which it was seen, Dactyl&#x27;s orbital period would be about 20 hours. Its orbital speed is roughly , &quot;about the speed of a fast run or a slowly thrown baseball&quot;.

=== Age and origin ===
Dactyl may have originated at the same time as Ida, from the disruption of the Koronis parent body. However, it may have formed more recently, perhaps as ejecta from a large impact on Ida. It is extremely unlikely that it was captured by Ida. Dactyl may have suffered a major impact around 100 million years ago, which reduced its size.
