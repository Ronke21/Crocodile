<text>The Pannonian Avars ( ) were an alliance of several groups of Eurasian nomads of various origins. The peoples were also known as the Obri in the chronicles of the Rus, the Abaroi or Varchonitai (), or Pseudo-Avars in Byzantine sources, and the Apar () to the G√∂kt√ºrks. They established the Avar Khaganate, which spanned the Pannonian Basin and considerable areas of Central and Eastern Europe from the late 6th to the early 9th century.

The name Pannonian Avars (after the area in which they settled) is used to distinguish them from the Avars of the Caucasus, a separate people with whom the Pannonian Avars may or may not have had links. Although the name &quot;Avar&quot; first appeared in the mid-5th century, the Pannonian Avars entered the historical scene in the mid-6th century, on the Pontic‚ÄìCaspian steppe as a people who wished to escape the rule of the G√∂kt√ºrks. They are probably best known for their invasions and destruction in the Avar‚ÄìByzantine wars from 568 to 626 and influence on the Slavic migrations to Southeastern Europe.

Recent archaeogenetic studies indicate that the Pannonian Avars were of primarily Ancient Northeast Asian ancestry similar to those of modern-day people from Mongolia and the Amur River region in Manchuria, pointing to an initial rapid migration of nomadic tribes into the centre of Europe from the Eastern Eurasian Steppe. The Pannonian Avars&#x27; core may have been descended from the remnants of the Rouran Khaganate, which were accompanied by other Steppe groups.

==Origins==
===Avars and pseudo-Avars===
The earliest clear reference to the Avar ethnonym comes from Priscus the Rhetor (420s‚Äìafter 472), who recounts that in c. 463 the ≈†aragurs and Onogurs were attacked by the Sabirs, who had been attacked by the Avars. In turn, the Avars had been driven off by people fleeing &quot;man-eating griffins&quot; coming from &quot;the ocean&quot; (&quot;Priscus Fr 40&quot;). Whilst Priscus&#x27; accounts provide some information about the ethno-political situation in the Don-Kuban-Volga region after the demise of the Huns, no unequivocal conclusions can be reached. Denis Sinor has argued that whoever the &quot;Avars&quot; referred to by Priscus were, they differed from the Avars who appear a century later, during the time of Justinian (r. 527‚Äì565).

The next author to discuss the Avars, Menander Protector, appeared during the 6th century and wrote of G√∂kt√ºrk embassies to Constantinople in 565 and 568. The Turks appeared angry at the Byzantines for having made an alliance with the Avars, whom the Turks saw as their subjects and slaves. Turxanthos, a Turk prince, calls the Avars &quot;Varchonites&quot; and &quot;escaped slaves of the Turks&quot;, who numbered &quot;about 20 thousand&quot; (&quot;Menander Fr 43&quot;).

Many more, but somewhat confusing, details come from Theophylact Simocatta, who in c. 629, describes the final two decades of the 6th century. In particular, he claims to quote a triumph letter from Turxanthos:


According to the interpretation of Dobrovits and Nechaeva, the Turks insisted that the Avars were only &quot;pseudo-Avars&quot;, so as to boast that they were the only formidable power in the Eurasian steppe. The G√∂kt√ºrks claimed that the &quot;real Avars&quot; remained loyal subjects of the Turks, farther east. A political name *&quot;(A)Par&quot; ê∞Øê∞ª was indeed mentioned in inscriptions honoring Kul Tigin and Bilge Qaghan, yet in Armenian sources (Egishe Vardapet, Ghazar Parpetsi, and Sebeos) &quot;Apar&quot; seemingly indicated &quot;a geographical area (Khorasan), which might also intimate a political formation once there&quot;; additionally, &quot;&#x27;Apar-shar&#x27;, that is, &quot;the country of the Apar&quot;&quot; was named after possibly Hephthalites, who were known as Êªë MC *&quot;…¶À†u…õtÃö&quot; &gt; Ch.&quot;Hu√°&quot; in Chinese sources. Even so, *&quot;Apar&quot; could not be linked to the European Avars, notwithstanding any link, if there were, between the Hephthalites and Rourans. Furthermore, Dobrovits has questioned the authenticity of Theophylact&#x27;s account. As such, he has argued that Theophylact borrowed information from Menander&#x27;s accounts of Byzantine‚ÄìTurk negotiations to meet political needs of his time‚Äìi.e. to castigate and deride the Avars during a time of strained political relations between the Byzantines and Avars (coinciding with Emperor Maurice&#x27;s northern Balkan campaigns).

===Paul the Deacon===
Paul the Deacon in his &quot;History of the Lombards&quot; insisted that Avars were known previously as Huns and he conflated the two groups.

===Uar, Rouran and other Central Asian peoples===

According to some scholars, the Pannonian Avars originated from a confederation formed in the Aral Sea region, by the Uar (also known as the &quot;Ouar&quot;, &quot;Warr&quot; or &quot;Var&quot;) and the Xionites. The Xionites had likely been speakers of Iranian and/or Turkic languages. The Hephthalites, affiliated previously to the Uar and Xionites, had remained in Central and northern South Asia. The Pannonian Avars were also known by names including &quot;Uarkhon&quot; or &quot;Varchonites&quot;which may have been a portmanteau combining &quot;Var&quot; and &quot;Chunni&quot;.

The 18th-century historian Joseph de Guignes postulates a link between the Avars of European history with the Rouran Khaganate of Inner Asia based on a coincidence between Tardan Khan&#x27;s letter to Constantinople and events recorded in Chinese sources, notably the &quot;Wei Shu&quot; and &quot;Bei Shi&quot;. Chinese sources state that Bumin Qaghan, founder of the First Turkic Khaganate, defeated the Rouran, some of whom fled and joined the Western Wei. Later, Bumin&#x27;s successor Muqan Qaghan defeated the Hephthalites as well as the Turkic Tiele. Superficially these victories over the Tiele, Rouran and Hephthalites echo a narrative in the &quot;Theophylact&quot;, boasting of Tardan&#x27;s victories over the Hephthalites, Avars and Oghurs. However, the two series of events are not synonymous: the events of the latter took place during Tardan&#x27;s rule, c. 580‚Äì599, whilst Chinese sources referring to the Turk defeat of the Rouran and other Central Asian peoples occurred 50 years earlier, at the founding of the First Turkic Khaganate. It is for this reason that the linguist J√°nos Harmatta rejected the identification of the Avars with the Rouran on this basis.

According to Edwin G. Pulleyblank, the name Avar is the same as the prestigious name Wuhuan in the Chinese sources. Several historians, including Peter Benjamin Golden, suggest that the Avars are of Turkic origin, likely from the Oghur branch. Another theory suggests that some of the Avars were of Tungusic origin. A study by Emil Her≈°ak and Ana Siliƒá (2002) suggests that the Avars were of heterogeneous origin, including mostly Turkic (Oghuric) and Mongolic groups. Later in Europe some Germanic and Slavic groups were assimilated into the Avars. Her≈°ak and Siliƒá concluded that their exact origin is unknown but stated that it is likely that the Avars were originally mainly composed of Turkic (Oghuric) tribes.

Increasing evidence supports a relationship between the elite of the Pannonian Avars and the Inner Asian Rouran Khaganate; however it remains unclear to what extent the European Avars descent from the Rouran population. It is argued that the initial elite core of the Pannonian Avars spoke a Para-Mongolic language (Serbi-Avar), which is a sister lineage to contemporary Mongolic languages.

===Steppe empire dynamics and ethnogenesis===
In 2003, Walter Pohl summarized the formation of nomadic empires:

1. Many steppe empires were founded by groups who had been defeated in previous power struggles but had fled from the dominion of the stronger group. The Avars were likely a losing faction previously subordinate to the Ashina clan in the Western Turkic Khaganate, and they fled west of the Dnieper.

2. These groups usually were of mixed origin, and each of its components was part of a previous group.

3. Crucial in the process was the elevation of a khagan, which signified a claim to independent power and an expansionist strategy. This group also needed a new name that would give all of its initial followers a sense of identity.

4. The name for a new group of steppe riders was often taken from a repertoire of prestigious names which did not necessarily denote any direct affiliation to or descent from groups of the same name; in the Early Middle Ages, Huns, Avars, Bulgars, and Ogurs, or names connected with -(o)gur (Kutrigurs, Utigurs, Onogurs, etc.), were most important. In the process of name-giving, both perceptions by outsiders and self-designation played a role. These names were also connected with prestigious traditions that directly expressed political pretensions and programmes, and had to be endorsed by success. In the world of the steppe, where agglomerations of groups were rather fluid, it was vital to know how to deal with a newly-emergent power. The symbolical hierarchy of prestige expressed through names provided some orientation for friend and foe alike.

Such views are mirrored by . &quot;The ethnogenesis of early medieval peoples of steppe origin cannot be conceived in a &quot;single linear&quot; fashion due to their great and constant mobility&quot;, with no ethnogenetic &quot;point zero&quot;, theoretical &quot;proto-people&quot; or proto-language. Moreover, Avar identity was strongly linked to Avar political institutions. Groups who rebelled or fled from the Avar realm could never be called &quot;Avars&quot;, but were rather termed &quot;Bulgars&quot;. Similarly, with the final demise of Avar power in the early 9th century, Avar identity disappeared almost instantaneously.

Savelyev and Jeong (2020) in &quot;Early nomads of the Eastern Steppe and their tentative connections in the West&quot; concluded that the initial Pannonian Avars formed in Central Asia from various ethno-linguistic groups, including Iranian peoples, Ugrians, Oghur-Turks, and Rouran tribes. They further note that &quot;the broadly East Asian component in the archaeological record of the European Avars is limited even in the earlier period of their history; elements originating from West Asia, the Caucasus, the Southern Russian steppes and the local Central European cultures can be traced alongside each other&quot;.

Subsequent analyses from 2022 on Avar remains however confirmed their Ancient Northeast Asian origin, and support a possible ethnogenesis of the Avar Elite from the former Rouran Khaganate.

===Anthropology===
In the Stuttgart Psalter there is an image of mounted archers riding backwards on their horses, a noted &quot;Asian&quot; tactic, which may depict the Avars. According to mid-20th century physical anthropologists such as P√°l Lipt√°k, human remains from the early Avar (7th century) period had mostly &quot;Europoid&quot; features, while grave goods indicated cultural links to the Eurasian Steppe. Cemeteries dated to the late Avar period (8th century) included many human remains with physical features typical of East Asian people or Eurasians (i.e., people with both East Asian and European ancestry). Remains with East Asian or Eurasian features were found in about one third of the Avar graves from the 8th century. According to Lipt√°k, 79% of the population of the Danube-Tisza region during the Avar period showed Europoid characteristics. However, Lipt√°k used racial terms later deprecated or regarded as obsolete, such as &quot;Mongoloid&quot; for northeast Asian and &quot;Turanid&quot; for individuals of mixed ancestry. Several theories suggest that the ruling class of the Avars were of Northern East Asian origin resembling the &quot;Tungid type&quot; (common among Tungusic speaking peoples).

===Archaeogenetics===
A genetic study published in &quot;Scientific Reports&quot; in September 2016 examined the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of 31 people buried in the Carpathian Basin between the 7th and 9th centuries. They were found to be mostly carrying European haplogroups such as H, K, T and U, while about 15% carried Asian haplogroups such as C, M6, D4c1 and F1a. Their mtDNA were found to be primarily characteristic of Eastern and Southern Europe.

A genetic study published in the &quot;American Journal of Physical Anthropology&quot; in 2018 examined 62 individuals buried in the 8th and 9th centuries at an Avar-Slavic burial in C√≠fer‚ÄêP√°c, Slovakia. Of the 46 samples of mtDNA extracted, 93% belonged to west Eurasian lineages, while 6% belonged to east Eurasian lineages. The amount of east Eurasian lineages was higher than among modern European populations, but lower than what has been found in other genetic studies on the Avars. The mtDNA of the examined individuals was found to be quite similar to medieval and modern Slavs, and it was suggested that the mixed population examined had emerged through intermarriage between Avar males and Slavic females.
A genetic study published in &quot;Scientific Reports&quot; in November 2019 examined the remains of fourteen Avar males. Eleven of them were dated to the early Avar period, and three were dated to the middle and late Avar period. The eleven early Avar males were found to be carrying the paternal haplogroups N1a1a1a1a3 (four samples), N1a1a (two samples), R1a1a1b2a (two samples), C2, G2a, and I1. The three males dated to the middle and late Avar period carried the paternal haplogroups C2, N1a1a1a1a3 and E1b1b1a1b1a. In short, most carried &quot;East Eurasian Y haplogroups typical for modern north-eastern Siberian and Buryat populations&quot;. The Avars studied were all determined to have had dark eyes and dark hair, and the majority of them were found to be primarily of East Asian origin.

A genetic study published in &quot;Scientific Reports&quot; in January 2020 examined the remains of 26 individuals buried at various elite Avar cemeteries in the Pannonian Basin dated to the 7th century. The mtDNA of these Avars belonged mostly to East Asian haplogroups, while the Y-DNA was exclusively of East Asian origin and &quot;strikingly homogenous&quot;, belonging to haplogroups N-M231 and Q-M242. The evidence suggests that the Avar elite were largely patrilineal and endogamous for a period of around one century, and entered the Pannonian Basin through migrations from East Asia involving both men and women. Another 2020 study, but of Xiongnu remains in East Asia, found that the Xiongnu shared certain paternal (N1a, Q1a, R1a-Z94 and R1a-Z2124) and maternal haplotypes with the Huns and Avars, and says on this basis that they were descended from Xiongnu, who they in turn suggested were descended from Scytho-Siberians.
A genetic study published in scientific journal &quot;Cell&quot; in April 2022 analyzed 48 Pannonian Avar samples from the early, middle and late period, and found nearly all of them to have a high level of Ancient Northeast Asian (ANA) ancestry. The paternal lineage N1a1a1a1a3a-F4205 was most common (today highest percent of haplogroup N-F4205 was found in Dukha people of Mongolia with 52.2%), with Q1a, Q1b, R1a, R1b and E1b subclades present in smaller numbers. The samples had a strong affinity with modern peoples inhabiting the region from Mongolia to the Amur, with a historical Rouran Khaganate sample, and with samples from Xiongnu-Xianbei periods in the eastern Asian steppe. The Avar individuals showed their highest genetic affinity with present-day Mongolic and Tungusic peoples, as well as Nivkhs.

A genetic study published in scientific journal &quot;Current Biology&quot; in May 2022 examined 143 Avar samples from various periods, including Avar elites and local commoners. It confirmed the Ancient Northeast Asian (ANA) paternal and maternal origin for the Avar elite, with N1a-F4205 being their predominant and characteristic paternal lineage, alongside incorporated Q1a2a1 and R1a-Z94 Hunnic-Iranian remnants, and the rest belonging to local haplogroups found among surrounding populations. Autosomally, the Elite Avar samples &quot;&quot;preserved very ancient Mongolian pre-Bronze Age genomes, with ca 90% [Ancient North-East Asian] ancestry&quot;, shared deep ancestry with European Huns, but although since Early Avar period started mixing with local and immigrant Hunnic-Iranian related populations, &quot;people with different genetic ancestries were seemingly distinguished, as samples with Hun-related genomes were buried in separate cemeteries&quot;&quot;. The majority of the Avar Khaganate general population consisted of local European peoples (EU_core) but did not display Northeast Asian admixture, supporting a model of elite dominance of arriving horse nomads over a large sedentary population, with at least some subsequent admixture events. Genetic data on later Avar elite samples showed continuity with earlier Avars and the long-term presence of Northeast Asian ancestry among the Avar elite, suggesting a possible endogamous social system. There was however an increase of Northeast Asian and Saka associated ancestry among the total population, suggesting either further migration from the Eurasian Steppe and admixture between local and Avar groups, or substructure among the overall population not observed before.

Wang et al. 2025 analyzed 722 remains from the periphery of the Avar Khaganate in Austria dating to 650‚Äì800 CE, specifically from sites in present-day Leobersdorf and M√∂dling, Lower Austria. Although both sites displayed a shared material culture, the remains from Leobersdorf displayed mostly East Asian ancestry, while the remains from M√∂dling displayed mostly European-like ancestry. The archaeogenetic data revealed that even after 200 years since the arrival of the &#x27;core Avars&#x27; from present-day Mongolia, East Asian ancestry remained dominant among their elite, but apparently also among non-elite groups in periphery areas, as is the case for Leobersdorf. According to the authors, this can primarily be explained via &quot;systematically choosing partners with similar ancestry from other sites in the Avar realm&quot;, until the assimilation of the Avar Khaganate into the Frankish empire starting at 800 CE, with the last Avar prince being mentionet in 822 CE. The male Avar remains from Leobersdorf carried primarily the paternal haplogroup C-M217, while a minority carried haplogroup O-M175 and haplogroup R1a, in contrast, the male remains from M√∂dling displayed a more heterogeneous variation, including mostly local haplogroups, and only a minority carrying haplogroup C-M217 or N1a. The authors note that &quot;what the evidence from Leobersdorf crucially shows is that entire groups of mostly Asian ancestry did not display elite or warrior status any more in the 8th century, and had moved out of the core area of the Avar realm&quot;, beyond that, non-Asian locals were fully assimilated into &#x27;Avar culture&#x27;, indistinguishable in terms of material culture.

== History ==

=== Arrival in Europe ===
In 557, the Avars sent an embassy to Constantinople, presumably from the northern Caucasus. This marked their first contact with the Byzantine Empire. In exchange for gold, they agreed to subjugate the &quot;unruly &quot;gentes&quot;&quot; on behalf of the Byzantines: subsequently they conquered and incorporated various nomadic tribesKutrigurs and Sabirsand defeated the Antes.

By 562 the Avars controlled the lower Danube basin and the steppes north of the Black Sea. By the time they arrived in the Balkans, the Avars formed a heterogeneous group of about 20,000 horsemen. After the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I bought them off, they pushed northwestwards into Germania. However, Frankish opposition halted the Avars&#x27; expansion in that direction. Seeking rich pastoral lands, the Avars initially demanded land south of the Danube in present-day Bulgaria, but the Byzantines refused, using their contacts with the G√∂kt√ºrks as a threat against Avar aggression. The Avars turned their attention to the Carpathian Basin and to the natural defenses it afforded. The Carpathian Basin was occupied by the Gepids. In 567 the Avars formed an alliance with the Lombardsenemies of the Gepidsand together they destroyed much of the Gepid kingdom. The Avars then persuaded the Lombards to move into northern Italy, an invasion that marked the last Germanic mass-movement in the Migration Period.

Continuing their successful policy of turning the various barbarians against each other, the Byzantines persuaded the Avars to attack the Sclavenes in Scythia Minor, a land rich with goods. After devastating much of the Sclavenes&#x27; land, the Avars returned to Pannonia after many of the khagan&#x27;s subjects deserted to the Byzantine emperor.

=== Early Avar period (580‚Äì670) ===

By about 580, the Avar Khagan Bayan I had established supremacy over most of the Slavic, Germanic and Bulgar tribes living in Pannonia and the Carpathian Basin. When the Byzantine Empire was unable to pay subsidies or hire Avar mercenaries, the Avars raided their Balkan territories. According to Menander, Bayan I commanded an army of 10,000 Kutrigur Bulgars and sacked Dalmatia in 568, effectively cutting the Byzantine terrestrial link with northern Italy and western Europe.

In the 580s and 590s, many of the imperial armies were busy fighting the Persians, and the remaining troops in the Balkans were no match for the Avars. By 582, the Avars had captured Sirmium, an important fort in Pannonia. When the Byzantines refused to increase the stipend amount as requested by Bayan&#x27;s son and successor Bayan II, the Avars proceeded to capture Singidunum (Belgrade) and Viminacium. They suffered setbacks, however, during Maurice&#x27;s Balkan campaigns in the 590s.

By 600 the Avars had established a nomadic empire ruling over a multitude of peoples and stretching from modern Austria in the west to the Pontic‚ÄìCaspian steppe in the east. After being defeated at the Battles of Viminacium in their homeland, some Avars defected to the Byzantines in 602, but Emperor Maurice decided not to return home as was customary. He maintained his army camp beyond the Danube throughout the winter, but the hardship caused the army to revolt, giving the Avars a desperately needed respite and they attempted an invasion of northern Italy in 610. The Byzantine civil war prompted a Persian invasion in the Byzantine‚ÄìSasanian War, and after 615 the Avars enjoyed a free hand in the undefended Balkans.

While negotiating with Emperor Heraclius beneath the walls of Constantinople in 617, the Avars launched a surprise attack. While they were unable to capture the city centre, they pillaged the suburbs and took 270,000 captives. Payments in gold and goods to the Avars reached a sum of 200,000 &quot;solidi&quot; shortly before 626. In 626, the Avars cooperated with the Sassanid force in the failed siege of 626. After the defeat, the political and military power of the Avars declined. Byzantine and Frankish sources documented a war between the Avars and their western Slav clients, the Wends.

In the 630s, Samo, the ruler of the first Slavic polity known as Samo&#x27;s Tribal Union or Samo&#x27;s realm, increased his authority over lands to the north and west of the Khaganate at the expense of the Avars, ruling until his death in 658. The &quot;Chronicle of Fredegar&quot; records that during Samo&#x27;s rebellion in 631, 9,000 Bulgars led by Alciocus left Pannonia to modern-day Bavaria where Dagobert I massacred most of them. The remaining 700 joined the Wends.

At about the time of Samo&#x27;s realm, Bulgar leader Kubrat of the Dulo clan led a successful uprising to end Avar authority over the Pannonian Plain, establishing Old Great Bulgaria, or Patria Onoguria, &quot;the homeland of Onogurs&quot;. The civil war, possibly a succession struggle in Onoguria between the Kutrigurs under Alciocus on one side and Utigur forces on the other, raged from 631 to 632. After Alciocus fled to Bavaria, the power of the Avars&#x27; Kutrigur forces was shattered, and Kubrat established peace between the Avars and Byzantium in 632. According to Constantine VII&#x27;s 10th century work &quot;De Administrando Imperio,&quot; a group of Croats who had separated from the White Croats in White Croatia had also fought against the Avars, after which they organized the Duchy of Croatia. The Unknown Archon&#x27;s people from Samo&#x27;s realm were also resettled at this time.

=== Middle (670‚Äì720) and late (720‚Äì822) Avar periods ===
With the death of Samo in 658 and Kubrat in 665, some Slavic tribes again came under Avar rule. Despite their father&#x27;s advice, Kubrat&#x27;s sons failed to maintain cohesion in Old Great Bulgaria which began to disintegrate. A few years later in the time of Batbayan, Old Great Bulgaria dissolved into five branches. From western Onoguria the first group of folk moved to Ravenna under Alzeco in the 650s. According to Book II of the &quot;Miracles of Saint Demetrius&quot;, a certain Avar Chagan seized his opportunity to coalesce in the regions further north in response to the secession of the Diocese of Sirmium in the 670s by a &quot;Kuber&quot; Chagan. 
:&quot;Finally, the (Avar) Chagan, considering them to constitute a people with an identity of its own put, in accordance to the custom of his race, a chieftain upon them, a man by the name of Kouver. When Kouver (Chagan) learned from some of his most intimate associates the desire of the exiled Romans for their ancestral homes, he gave the matter some thought, then took them together with other peoples, i.e., the foreigners who had joined them, [as is said in the Book of Moses about the Jews at the time of their exodus,] with all their baggage and arms. According to what is said, they rebelled and separated themselves from the (Avar) Chagan. The (Avar) Chagan, when he learned this, set himself in pursuit of them, met them in five or six battles and, being defeated in each one by them, took flight and retired to the regions further north. After the victory, Kouver (Chagan), together with the aforementioned people, crossed the aforementioned river Danube, came to our regions and occupied the Keramesion plain.&quot;
About this time, &quot;Mark of Kalt&quot; records that in 677, the principality of Ungvar (Ung fortress) was established in the regions further north where Kotrag&#x27;s group also fled following the chaos, and a third group of Onogur-Bulgarians led by Batayan was subdued by Ziebel&#x27;s emerging Khazar Empire according to Nikephoros I of Constantinople. Under Mauros, a fourth group of folk eventually settled in the present-day region of North Macedonia. The fifth group from Onogur, Bulgaria, led by Khan Asparukh‚Äîthe father of Khan Tervel‚Äîsettled permanently along the Danube (c. 679‚Äì681), establishing the First Bulgarian Empire, stabilized by the victory at the battle of Ongal south of the eastern Carpathians. The Bulgarians turned on Byzantium who had established an alliance with Ziebel&#x27;s Khazars.

Although the Avar empire had diminished to half its original size, the Avar-Slav alliance consolidated their rule west from the central parts of the mid-Danubian basin and extended their sphere of influence west to the Vienna Basin. The new ethnic element marked by hair clips for pigtails; curved, single-edged sabres; and broad, symmetrical bows marks the middle Avar-Bulgar period (670‚Äì720). New regional centers, such as those near Ozora and Igar appeared. This strengthened the Avars&#x27; power base, although most of the Balkans lay in the hands of Slavic tribes since neither the Avars nor Byzantines were able to reassert control.

There are very few sources that cover the last century of Avar history. They only talk about the relations between the Avars and Lombards but little about the internals of the khaganate, so information about the Carpathian Basin is mostly from archaeology. Even here, elites are almost invisible, and there is little evidence of nomadic behavior. This transformation is little understood, but may have something to do with population growth.

A new type of ceramics‚Äîthe so-called &quot;Dev√≠nska Nov√° Ves&quot; pottery‚Äîemerged at the end of the 7th century in the region between the Middle Danube and the Carpathians. These vessels were similar to the hand-made pottery of the previous period, but wheel-made items were also found in Dev√≠nska Nov√° Ves sites. Large inhumation cemeteries found at Holiare, Nov√© Z√°mky and other places in Slovakia, Hungary and Serbia from the period beginning around 690 show that the settlement network of the Carpathian Basin became more stable in the Late Avar period. The most popular Late Avar motifs‚Äîgriffins and tendrils decorating belts, mounts and a number of other artifacts connected to warriors‚Äîmay either represent nostalgia for the lost nomadic past or evidence a new wave of nomads arriving from the Pontic steppes at the end of the 7th century. According to historians who accept the latter theory, the immigrants may have been either Onogurs or Alans. Anthropological studies of the skeletons point at the presence of a population with mongoloid features.

In the early 8th century, a new archaeological culture‚Äîthe so-called &quot;griffin and tendril&quot; culture‚Äîappeared in the Carpathian Basin. Some theories, including the &quot;double conquest&quot; theory of archaeologist Gyula L√°szl√≥, attribute it to the arrival of new settlers, such as early Magyars, but this is still under debate. Hungarian archaeologists Laszl√≥ Makkai and Andr√°s M√≥csy attribute this culture to an internal evolution of Avars resulting from the integration of the Bulgar √©migr√©s from the previous generation of the 670s. According to Makkai and M√≥csy, &quot;the material culture‚Äîart, clothing, equipment, weapons‚Äîof the late Avar/Bulgar period evolved autonomously from these new foundations&quot;. Many regions that had once been important centers of the Avar Empire had lost their significance while new ones arose. Although Avaric material culture found over much of the northern Balkans may indicate an existing Avar presence, it probably represents the presence of independent Slavs who had adopted Avaric customs. Radovan Bunard≈æiƒá dated Avar-Bulgar graves excavated in ƒåelarevo (near Sirmium), containing skulls with Mongolian features and Judaic symbols, to the late 8th century and 9th century.

=== Collapse ===


The gradual decline of Avar power accelerated to a rapid fall. A series of Frankish campaigns, beginning from 788, ended with the conquest of the Avar realm within a decade. Initial conflict between Avars and Franks occurred soon after the Frankish deposition of Bavarian duke Tassilo III and the establishment of direct Frankish rule over Bavaria in 788. At that time, the border between Bavarians and Avars was situated on the river Enns. An initial Avarian incursion into Bavaria was repelled, and Franco-Bavarian forces responded by taking the war to neighbouring Avarian territories, situated along the Danube, east of Enns. The two sides collided near the river Ybbs, on Ybbs Field (), where the Avars suffered a defeat in 788. This heralded the rise of Frankish power and Avarian decline in the region.

In 790, the Avars tried to negotiate a peace settlement with the Franks, but no agreement was reached. A Frankish campaign against the Avars, initiated in 791, ended successfully for the Franks. A large Frankish army, led by Charlemagne, crossed from Bavaria into the Avarian territory beyond the Enns, and started to advance along the Danube in two columns, but found no resistance and soon reached the region of the Vienna Woods, near the Pannonian Plain. No pitched battle was fought, since the Avars had fled before the advancing Carolingian army, while disease left most of the Avar horses dead. Tribal infighting began, showing the weakness of the khaganate.

The Franks had been supported by the Slavs, who established polities on former Avar territory. Charlemagne&#x27;s son Pepin of Italy captured a large, fortified encampment known as &quot;the Ring&quot;, which contained much of the spoils from earlier Avar campaigns. The campaign against the Avars again gathered momentum. By 796, the Avar chieftains had surrendered and became open to the acceptance of Christianity. In the meantime, all of Pannonia was conquered. According to the &quot;Annales Regni Francorum&quot;, the Avars began to submit to the Franks in 796. The song &quot;De Pippini regis Victoria Avarica&quot; celebrating the defeat of the Avars at the hands of Pepin of Italy in 796 still survives. The Franks baptized many Avars and integrated them into the Frankish Empire. In 799, some Avars revolted.

In 804, Bulgaria conquered the southeastern Avar lands in Transylvania and southeastern Pannonia up to the Middle Danube, and many Avars became subjects of the Bulgarian Empire. Khagan Theodorus, a convert to Christianity, died after asking Charlemagne for help in 805; he was succeeded by Khagan Abraham, who was baptized as the new Frankish client (and should not be assumed from his name alone to have been Khavar rather than Pseudo-Avar). Abraham was succeeded by Khagan (or Tudun) Isaac (Latin &quot;Canizauci&quot;), about whom little is known. The Franks turned the Avar lands under their control into a frontier march. The March of Pannoniathe eastern half of the Avar Marchwas then granted to the Slavic Prince Pribina, who established the Lower Pannonia principality in 840.

Whatever was left of Avar power was effectively ended when the Bulgars expanded their territory into the central and eastern portions of traditional Avar lands around 829. According to Pohl, an Avar presence in Pannonia is certain in 871, but thereafter the name is no longer used by chroniclers. Pohl wrote, &quot;It simply proved impossible to keep up an Avar identity after Avar institutions and the high claims of their tradition had failed&quot;, although Regino wrote about them in 889. The growing amount of archaeological evidence in Transdanubia also presumes an Avar population in the Carpathian Basin in the late 9th century. Archaeological findings suggest a substantial, late Avar presence on the Great Hungarian Plain; however, it is difficult to determine their proper chronology. The preliminary results of the new excavations also imply that the known and largely accepted theory of the destruction of the Avar settlement area is outdated; a disastrous depopulation of the Avar Khaganate never happened.

Byzantine records, including the &quot;Notitia episcopatuum&quot;, the &quot;Additio patriarchicorum thronorum&quot; by Neilos Doxapatres, the &quot;Chronica&quot; by Petrus Alexandrinus and the &quot;Notitia patriarchatuum&quot;&quot; mention the 9th century Avars as an existing Christian population. The Avars had already been mixing with the more numerous Slavs for generations, and they later came under the rule of external polities, such as the Franks, Bulgaria, and Great Moravia. Fine presumes that Avar descendants who survived the Hungarian Conquest in the 890s were likely absorbed by the Hungarian population. After the mid to late 8th-century Frankish conquest of Pannonia, Avar and Bulgar refugees migrated to settle in the area of Bulgaria and along its western periphery. The Avars in the region known as &quot;solitudo avarorum&quot;currently called the Great Hungarian Plainvanished in an arc of three generations. They slowly merged with the Slavs to create a bilingual Turkic-Slavic-speaking people who were subjected to Frankish domination; the invading Magyars found this composite people in the late 9th century. The &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot;, written around 950 and based on older documents, states that &quot;there are still descendants of the Avars in Croatia, and are recognized as Avars&quot;. Modern historians and archaeologists until now proved the opposite, that Avars never lived in Dalmatia proper (including Lika), that statement occurred somewhere in Pannonia, and the information belongs to the 9th century. There has been speculation that the modern Avar people of the Caucasus might have an uncertain connection to the historical Avars, but direct descent from them is rejected or doubted by many scholars.

== List of known khagans ==
The recorded Avar khagans were:
* Shaush (? ‚Äì c. 552)
* Kandik (c. 552 ‚Äì c. 562) 
* Bayan I (562‚Äì602)
* Bayan II (602‚Äì617) 
* Bayan III (617‚Äì630)
* Kouver Chagan (677‚Äì?)
* Theodorus (795‚Äì805)
* Abraham (805‚Äì?) 
* Isaac (?‚Äì835)

==Social and tribal structure==
The Pannonian Basin was the centre of the Avar power base. The Avars resettled captives from the peripheries of their empire to more central regions. Avar material culture is found south to Macedonia. However, to the east of the Carpathians, there are next to no Avar archaeological finds, suggesting that they lived mainly in the western Balkans. Scholars propose that a highly structured and hierarchical Avar society existed, having complex interactions with other &quot;barbarian&quot; groups. The khagan was the paramount figure, surrounded by a minority of nomadic aristocracy.

A few exceptionally rich burials have been uncovered, confirming that power was limited to the khagan and a close-knit class of &quot;elite warriors&quot;. In addition to hoards of gold coins that accompanied the burials, the men were often buried with symbols of rank, such as decorated belts, weapons, stirrups resembling those found in central Asia, as well as their horse. The Avar army was composed from numerous other groups: Slavic, Gepidic and Bulgar military units. There also appeared to have existed semi-independent &quot;client&quot; (predominantly Slavic) tribes which served strategic roles, such as engaging in diversionary attacks and guarding the Avars&#x27; western borders abutting the Frankish Empire.

Initially, the Avars and their subjects lived separately, except for Slavic and Germanic women who married Avar men. Eventually, the Germanic and Slavic peoples were included in the Avaric social order and culture, which was Persian-Byzantine in fashion. Scholars have identified a fused Avar-Slavic culture, characterized by ornaments such as half-moon-shaped earrings, Byzantine-styled buckles, beads, and bracelets with horn-shaped ends. Paul Fouracre notes, &quot;[T]here appears in the seventh century a mixed Slavic-Avar material culture, interpreted as peaceful and harmonious relationships between Avar warriors and Slavic peasants. It is thought possible that at least some of the leaders of the Slavic tribes could have become part of the Avar aristocracy&quot;. Apart from the assimilated Gepids, a few graves of Carolingian peoples have been found in the Avar lands. They perhaps served as mercenaries.

==Language==
The language or languages spoken by the Avars are unknown. Classical philologist Samu Sz√°deczky-Kardoss said that most of the Avar words used in contemporaneous Latin or Greek texts appear to have their origins in possibly Mongolian or Turkic languages. Other theories propose a Tungusic origin. According to Sz√°deczky-Kardoss, many of the titles and ranks used by the Pannonian Avars were also used by Turks, Proto-Bulgars, Uighurs and/or Mongols, including &quot;khagan&quot; (or &quot;kagan&quot;), &quot;khan, kapkhan, tudun, tarkhan&quot;, and &quot;khatun&quot;. There is evidence, however, that ruling and subject clans spoke a variety of languages. Proposals by scholars include Caucasian, Iranian, Tungusic, Hungarian and Turkic.

Historian Gyula L√°szl√≥ has suggested that the late 9th-century Pannonian Avars spoke a variety of Old Hungarian, thereby forming an Avar-Hungarian continuity with then-newly arrived Hungarians. Based on archeologic and linguistic data, Florin Curta and Johanna Nichols considered that there is no convincing evidence for the presence of any Turkic or Mongolic languages among the Avars, but evidence for the presence of Iranian languages, further strengthened by Iranian-derived loanwords and toponyms in the region and among languages within the range of the Avars. Shimunek (2017) proposes that the elite core of the Avars spoke a &quot;Para-Mongolic language&quot; of the &quot;Serbi‚ÄìAwar&quot; group, that is a sister branch of the Mongolic languages. Together, the Serbi‚ÄìAwar and Mongolic languages make up the &quot;Serbi‚ÄìMongolic&quot; languages.

Some scholars like Omeljan Pritsak, Horace Lunt, Florin Curta speculate that Proto-Slavic became the lingua franca of the Avar Khaganate, which helped spreading the Slavic language in the Southeastern Europe. The assumption is problematic for several reasons, as Alan Timberlake notes that there was no &quot;radical loss of grammar that accompanies creolization&quot; neither the Avars and Slavs had specific social and economical mechanisms for spreading &quot;lingua franca&quot;. Jouko Lindstedt asserts that Late Proto-Slavic/Common Slavic had a complex morphological and accentological system because of which &quot;shows no trace of a possible lingua-franca function&quot;.

==Warfare==
The Avars were skilled warriors and almost exclusively fought on horseback. They often used light horse archers armed with powerful composite bows, as many other steppe peoples. These archers wore little to no armour, besides occasional helmets or knee guards. The Avars also employed the use of heavy cavalry, fully armoured in chainmail or scale armour as well as helmets. These heavier troops were armed with long lances, swords, and daggers. Upon subjugating the Slavic tribes in Pannonia, they often allied with the Slavs and employed them as foot soldiers even together laying siege to Constantinople, along with large numbers of Persians. These Slav warriors were usually armed with bows, axes, various types of spears, and round shields.

The Byzantine Emperor Maurice wrote of the Avars and other nomad peoples in the Strategikon:

== Avar-Hungarian continuity theory ==
Gyula L√°szl√≥ says that the late Avars, arriving to the khaganate in 670 in great numbers, lived through the time between the destruction and plunder of the Avar state by the Franks during 791‚Äì795 and the arrival of the Magyars in 895. L√°szl√≥ points out that the settlements of the Hungarians (Magyars) complemented, rather than replaced, those of the Avars. Avars remained on the plough fields, good for agriculture, while Hungarians took the river banks and river flats, suitable for pasturage. He notes that while the Hungarian graveyards consist of 40‚Äì50 graves on average, those of the Avars contain 600‚Äì1,000. According to these findings, the Avars not only survived the end of the Avar polity but lived in great masses and far outnumbered the Hungarian conquerors of √Årp√°d.

He also shows that Hungarians occupied only the centre of the Carpathian basin, but Avars lived in a larger territory. Looking at those territories where only the Avars lived, there are only Hungarian geographical names, not Slavic or Turkic as would be expected interspersed among them. This is further evidence for the Avar-Hungarian continuity. Names of the Hungarian tribes, chieftains and the words used for the leaders, etc., suggest that at least the leaders of the Hungarian conquerors were Turkic speaking. However, Hungarian is not a Turkic language, rather Uralic, and so they must have been assimilated by the Avars that outnumbered them.

L√°szl√≥&#x27;s Avar-Hungarian continuity theory posits that the modern Hungarian language descends from that spoken by the Avars rather than the conquering Magyars. Based on DNA evidence from graves, the original Magyars most resembled modern Bashkirs, a Turkic people located near the Urals, whereas the Khanty and Mansi, whose languages most resemble Hungarian, live some ways to the northeast of the Bashkirs.

<text>Blood vessels are the tubular structures of a circulatory system that transport blood throughout a vertebrate&#x27;s body. Blood vessels transport blood cells, nutrients, and oxygen to most of the tissues of a body. They also take waste and carbon dioxide away from the tissues. Some tissues such as cartilage, epithelium, and the lens and cornea of the eye are not supplied with blood vessels and are termed &quot;avascular&quot;.

There are five types of blood vessels: the arteries, which carry the blood away from the heart; the arterioles; the capillaries, where the exchange of water and chemicals between the blood and the tissues occurs; the venules; and the veins, which carry blood from the capillaries back towards the heart.

The word &quot;vascular&quot;, is derived from the Latin &quot;vas&quot;, meaning &quot;vessel&quot;, and is mostly used in relation to blood vessels.
== Etymology ==
* artery ‚Äì late Middle English; from Latin &quot;arteria&quot;, from Greek &quot;artƒìria&quot;, probably from &quot;airein&quot; (&quot;raise&quot;).
* vein ‚Äì Middle English; from Old French &quot;veine&quot;, from Latin &quot;vena&quot;.
* capillary ‚Äì mid-17th century; from Latin &quot;capillaris&quot;, from &quot;capillus&quot; (&quot;hair&quot;), influenced by Old French &quot;capillaire&quot;.

== Structure ==
The arteries and veins have three layers. The middle layer is thicker in the arteries than it is in the veins:
* The inner layer, &quot;tunica intima&quot;, is the thinnest layer. It is a single layer of flat cells (simple squamous epithelium) glued by a polysaccharide intercellular matrix, surrounded by a thin layer of subendothelial connective tissue interlaced with a number of circularly arranged elastic bands called the &quot;internal elastic lamina&quot;. A thin membrane of elastic fibers in the tunica intima run parallel to the vessel.
* The middle layer of &quot;tunica media&quot; is the thickest layer in arteries. It consists of circularly arranged elastic fiber, connective tissue and polysaccharide substances; the second and third layer are separated by another thick elastic band called &quot;external elastic lamina&quot;. The tunica media may (especially in arteries) be rich in vascular smooth muscle, which controls the caliber of the vessel. Veins do not have the external elastic lamina, but only an internal one. The tunica media is thicker in the arteries rather than the veins.
* The outer layer is the &quot;tunica adventitia&quot; and the thickest layer in veins. It is entirely made of connective tissue. It also contains nerves that supply the vessel as well as nutrient capillaries (vasa vasorum) in the larger blood vessels.

Capillaries consist of a single layer of endothelial cells with a supporting subendothelium consisting of a basement membrane and connective tissue. When blood vessels connect to form a region of diffuse vascular supply, it is called an anastomosis. Anastomoses provide alternative routes for blood to flow through in case of blockages. Veins can have valves that prevent the backflow of the blood that was being pumped against gravity by the surrounding muscles. In humans, arteries do not have valves except for the two &#x27;arteries&#x27; that originate from the heart&#x27;s ventricles.

Early estimates by Danish physiologist August Krogh suggested that the total length of capillaries in human muscles could reach approximately (assuming a high muscle mass human body, like that of a bodybuilder). However, later studies suggest a more conservative figure of taking into account updated capillary density and average muscle mass in adults. Despite these later studies, many textbooks and other types of media include Krogh&#x27;s estimates as a fun fact as opposed to the more recent studies.

=== Types ===
There are various kinds of blood vessels:
* Arteries
** Elastic arteries
** Distributing arteries
** Arterioles
* Capillaries (smallest type of blood vessels)
* Venules
* Veins
** Large collecting vessels, such as the subclavian vein, the jugular vein, the renal vein and the iliac vein.
** Venae cavae (the two largest veins, carry blood into the heart).
* Sinusoids
** Extremely small vessels located within bone marrow, the spleen and the liver.

They are roughly grouped as &quot;arterial&quot; and &quot;venous&quot;, determined by whether the blood in it is flowing &quot;away from&quot; (arterial) or &quot;toward&quot; (venous) the heart. The term &quot;arterial blood&quot; is nevertheless used to indicate blood high in oxygen, although the pulmonary artery carries &quot;venous blood&quot; and blood flowing in the pulmonary vein is rich in oxygen. This is because they are carrying the blood to and from the lungs, respectively, to be oxygenated.

== Function ==

Blood vessels function to transport blood to an animal&#x27;s body tissues. In general, arteries and arterioles transport oxygenated blood from the lungs to the body and its organs, and veins and venules transport deoxygenated blood from the body to the lungs. Blood vessels also circulate blood throughout the circulatory system. Oxygen (bound to hemoglobin in red blood cells) is the most critical nutrient carried by the blood. In all arteries apart from the pulmonary artery, hemoglobin is highly saturated (95‚Äì100%) with oxygen. In all veins, apart from the pulmonary vein, the saturation of hemoglobin is about 75%. (The values are reversed in the pulmonary circulation.) In addition to carrying oxygen, blood also carries hormones, and nutrients to the cells of a body and removes waste products.

Blood vessels do not actively engage in the transport of blood (they have no appreciable peristalsis). Blood is propelled through arteries and arterioles through pressure generated by the heartbeat. Blood vessels also transport red blood cells. Hematocrit tests can be performed to calculate the proportion of red blood cells in the blood. Higher proportions result in conditions such as dehydration or heart disease, while lower proportions could lead to anemia and long-term blood loss.

Permeability of the endothelium is pivotal in the release of nutrients to the tissue. It is also increased in inflammation in response to histamine, prostaglandins and interleukins, which leads to most of the symptoms of inflammation (swelling, redness, warmth and pain).

=== Constriction ===
Arteries‚Äîand veins to a degree‚Äîcan regulate their inner diameter by contraction of the muscular layer. This changes the blood flow to downstream organs and is determined by the autonomic nervous system. Vasodilation and vasoconstriction are also used antagonistically as methods of thermoregulation.

The size of blood vessels is different for each of them. It ranges from a diameter of about 30‚Äì25 millimeters for the aorta to only about 5 micrometers (0,005mm) for the capillaries. Vasoconstriction is the constriction of blood vessels (narrowing, becoming smaller in cross-sectional area) by contracting the vascular smooth muscle in the vessel walls. It is regulated by vasoconstrictors (agents that cause vasoconstriction). These can include paracrine factors (e.g., prostaglandins), a number of hormones (e.g., vasopressin and angiotensin) and neurotransmitters (e.g., epinephrine) from the nervous system.

Vasodilation is a similar process mediated by antagonistically acting mediators. The most prominent vasodilator is nitric oxide (termed endothelium-derived relaxing factor for this reason).

=== Flow ===

The circulatory system uses the channel of blood vessels to deliver blood to all parts of the body. This is a result of the left and right sides of the heart working together to allow blood to flow continuously to the lungs and other parts of the body. Oxygen-poor blood enters the right side of the heart through two large veins. Oxygen-rich blood from the lungs enters through the pulmonary veins on the left side of the heart into the aorta and then reaches the rest of the body. The capillaries are responsible for allowing the blood to receive oxygen through tiny air sacs in the lungs. This is also the site where carbon dioxide exits the blood. This all occurs in the lungs where blood is oxygenated.

The blood pressure in blood vessels is traditionally expressed in millimetres of mercury (1 mmHg = 133 Pa). In the arterial system, this is usually around 120 mmHg systolic (high pressure wave due to contraction of the heart) and 80 mmHg diastolic (low pressure wave). In contrast, pressures in the venous system are constant and rarely exceed 10 mmHg.

Vascular resistance occurs when the vessels away from the heart oppose the flow of blood. Resistance is an accumulation of three different factors: blood viscosity, blood vessel length and vessel radius. Blood viscosity is the thickness of the blood and its resistance to flow as a result of the different components of the blood. Blood is 92% water by weight and the rest of blood is composed of protein, nutrients, electrolytes, wastes, and dissolved gases. Depending on the health of an individual, the blood viscosity can vary (i.e., anemia causing relatively lower concentrations of protein, high blood pressure an increase in dissolved salts or lipids, etc.).

Vessel length is the total length of the vessel measured as the distance away from the heart. As the total length of the vessel increases, the total resistance as a result of friction will increase. Vessel radius also affects the total resistance as a result of contact with the vessel wall. As the radius of the wall gets smaller, the proportion of the blood making contact with the wall will increase. The greater amount of contact with the wall will increase the total resistance against the blood flow.

== Disease ==
Blood vessels play a huge role in virtually every medical condition. Cancer, for example, cannot progress unless the tumor causes angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels) to supply the malignant cells&#x27; metabolic demand. Atherosclerosis represents around 85% of all deaths from cardiovascular diseases due to the buildup of plaque. Coronary artery disease that often follows after atherosclerosis can cause heart attacks or cardiac arrest, resulting in 370,000 worldwide deaths in 2022. In 2019, around 17.9 million people died from cardiovascular diseases. Of these deaths, around 85% of them were due to heart attack and stroke.

Blood vessel permeability is increased in inflammation. Damage, due to trauma or spontaneously, may lead to hemorrhage due to mechanical damage to the vessel endothelium. In contrast, occlusion of the blood vessel by atherosclerotic plaque, an embolised blood clot or a foreign body leads to downstream ischemia (insufficient blood supply) and possibly infarction (necrosis due to lack of blood supply). Vessel occlusion tends to be a positive feedback system; an occluded vessel creates eddies in the normally laminar flow or plug flow blood currents. These eddies create abnormal fluid velocity gradients which push blood elements, such as cholesterol or chylomicron bodies, to the endothelium. These deposit onto the arterial walls which are already partially occluded and build upon the blockage.

The most common disease of the blood vessels is hypertension or high blood pressure. This is caused by an increase in the pressure of the blood flowing through the vessels. Hypertension can lead to heart failure and stroke. Aspirin helps prevent blood clots and can also help limit inflammation. Vasculitis is inflammation of the vessel wall due to autoimmune disease or infection.

<doc id="48531" wikidata="Q957394" url="?curid=48531" title="Dry ski slope">
<text>A dry ski slope or artificial ski slope is a ski slope that mimics the attributes of snow using materials that are stable at room temperature, to enable people to ski, snowboard or snow tube in places where natural, snow-covered slopes are inconvenient or unavailable.

Although commonly known as &quot;dry ski slopes&quot;, many slopes are lubricated using a mist or jet system to increase speed and prevent damage to equipment from friction heat build-up.

== Materials ==

=== Early materials ===

A variety of materials can be found on dry ski slopes.

Early efforts to mimic snow involved laying extruded plastic tiles with upward spikes in an attempt to provide grip. These were unpopular as they provided little grip and turning capability and the experience was similar to skiing across ice.

However, in present day, many ski slopes (both indoor and outdoor) continue to use plastic, injection moulded tiles. Quality has improved and many dry ski slopes in the Netherlands use these tiles for training and championships.

=== Brush materials ===
The next stage in dry ski slope development came with the brush industry. The most common material is Dendix which is a by-product of brush manufacturing and is similar to a short-haired brush with the bristles sticking upwards. Dendix is manufactured in Chepstow, however it can be found on slopes throughout the world. It is arranged in a hexagonal pattern of approximately strips of bristles in a hexagon. Although it was a significant advancement from previous surfaces, concern over damage to slope users (it provides little or no impact protection to a slope user when falling) and ski or snowboard damage due to friction meant litigation for slopes using it was a constant threat. Nowadays water is often sprayed onto the surface of the dendix to lubricate it and increase speed; however, higher insurance premiums cause many slope operators to look for safer alternatives.

Despite more recent materials, Dendix remains the most popular plastic slope material in use.

=== Recent materials ===

The most recent development has seen a crop of materials providing both impact protection and slope lubrication as well as the ability to perform turns, erect jumps, rails and quarterpipes and provide a ride that is closer to the feel of real snow. Neveplast is one of these, a newer material whose use is becoming even more common. This new type of mat, which uses a concentric arrangement of conical stems, is marketed for downhill, snowboarding and cross country skiing. Neveplast claims to be certified as having the same coefficient of friction between the surface and the ski as snow, allowing the skier a good side grip, with the same skis used on the snow, and without the need for water. The Neveplast cooling hole has a comparable diameter to the F.I.S. slalom pole standards used for training and competition in both slalom and giant slalom. Neveplast is also used for school camps. This surface is modular and flexible, used frequently also for Urban freestyle parks.

A further recent evolution is the Ecosnow product from the Italian company Newsnow which, thanks to a mix resulting from research and development, guarantees great smoothness and the possibility of performing movements correctly, both for learning and for more expert skiers. Without neglecting environmental aspects, being a fully recyclable material and respectful of bio-ecological balances.

A German provider that guarantees year round skiing is Mr. Snow. The company does not only produce dry slopes for downhill skiing, snowboarding and cross country skiing but also provides tubing tracks and rental opportunities for events. The material of Mr. Snow is claimed to have very good sliding capacities, is predictable in all climates and does not harm the ski or sliding surface. Mr. Snow works without the use of silicone which is not necessary to achieve good sliding characteristics. The snow carpet evidently has no negative environmental impact, so the mats can remain on the surface 365 days a year.
It is also possible to remove them very quickly if it is required. Temporary using can be realized with the 20 sqm modules.
Another very common mat is Snowflex, manufactured near Huddersfield, West Yorkshire in England by Briton Engineering Developments Limited. Others include Perma-snow by John Nike Leisure/ Techmat 2000, also in the UK and Astroride by NorCal Extreme Sports in the United States. Snowflex and Perma-snow are both white in colour, although the former has been produced in a darker green (such as in Kendal Ski Club in Cumbria, England) to comply with planning requirements. There is no indication from NorCal Extreme Sports that AstroRide has been commercially tested to any great extent. 

The latest arrival is from UK company Proslope who produce a matting with variable filament lengths to emulate the gradual edge grip and release of snow. As with some other surfaces, the system is coloured white, is modular, and works both with and without a misting system.
A type of Enoki mushroom dry ski slope surface from China. Countless thin strips with round balls on the top, resembling a mushroom-like shape, make the surface of the run-in slopes of the Training Centre airbag jumps differently from other dry slope surfaces in terms of sliding effect and safety. Its structure, friction, elasticity, safety protection, and simulation effect provide an ideal surface for airbag beginners and high-performance athletes. The surface allows the rider to either carve or skid to aid in speed control or line choice. It is possible to turn on the surface quite well, but the aim is to maintain a low edge angle and make small adjustments to create speed or set your line. This type of dry ski mat appeared for the first time at a FIS World Cup competition.

== Ski and board preparation ==
Dry slope users often improve the performance of their equipment by using the hardest grade of ski wax. The wax wears off quickly, however, and must be renewed after one or two sessions. At least one company makes a hard wax that is intended for use on dry slopes. Some users apply aerosol furniture polish or other can-based products to the bases of their skis or boards as the silicone oil it contains is reputed to reduce friction. Other substances, such as dishwashing liquid, are sometimes used.

<doc id="48532" wikidata="Q2069" url="?curid=48532" title="Juan Manuel Fangio">
<text>Juan Manuel Fangio (, ; 24 June 1911 ‚Äì 17 July 1995) was an Argentine racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Nicknamed &quot;El Chueco&quot; and &quot;El Maestro&quot;, Fangio won five Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship titles and‚Äîat the time of his retirement‚Äîheld the record for most wins (24), pole positions (29), fastest laps (23), and podium finishes (35), among others.

From childhood, he abandoned his studies to pursue auto mechanics. In 1938, he debuted in the newly-formed Argentine stock car racing series Turismo Carretera, competing in a Ford V8. In 1940, he competed with Chevrolet, winning the Grand Prix International Championship and devoted his time to the Turismo Carretera becoming its champion, a title he successfully defended a year later. Fangio then competed in Europe between 1947 and 1949, where he achieved further success.

One of the most successful drivers in Formula One history, he made his debut in the inaugural Formula One season in 1950 to dominate the first decade of the championship. He went on to win the World Drivers&#x27; Championship five times‚Äîa record that stood for 46 years‚Äîand became the only driver in F1 history to win titles with four different teams: Alfa Romeo (1951), Maserati (1954 and 1957), Mercedes-Benz (1954 and 1955), and Ferrari (1956). He holds the highest winning percentage in Formula One at 46.15%, winning 24 of 52 Formula One races he entered. Additionally, Fangio also holds the record for the highest pole percentage at 55.77%, achieving 29 pole positions from 52 entries. Fangio is the only Argentine driver to have won the World Drivers&#x27; Championship and the Argentine Grand Prix. He also competed in sports car racing, winning the 12 Hours of Sebring in 1956 with Ferrari and in 1957 with Maserati.

After retirement, Fangio presided as the honorary president of Mercedes-Benz Argentina from 1987, a year after the inauguration of his museum, until his death in 1995. In 2011, on the centenary of his birth, Fangio was remembered around the world and various activities were held in his honor.

==Early life==
Fangio&#x27;s grandfather, Giuseppe Fangio, emigrated to Buenos Aires from Italy in 1887. Giuseppe was able to buy his own farm near Balcarce, a small town near Mar del Plata in southern Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, within three years by making charcoal from tree branches. Giuseppe brought his family, with his 7-year son Loreto, later the racing driver&#x27;s father, to Argentina from the small central Italian town of Castiglione Messer Marino in the Chieti province of the Abruzzo region. His mother, Herminia D√©ramo, was from Tornareccio, slightly to the north. Fangio&#x27;s parents married on 24 October 1903 and lived on farms, where Herminia was a housekeeper and Loreto worked in the building trade, becoming an apprentice stonemason.

Fangio was born in Balcarce on 24 June 1911, San Juan&#x27;s Day, at 12:10¬†am. His birth certificate was mistakenly dated 23 June in the Register of Balcarce. He was the fourth of six children. In his childhood he became known as &quot;El Chueco&quot;, the bandy-legged one, for his skill in bending his left leg around the ball to shoot on goal in football games.

Fangio started his education at School No. 4 of Balcarce, before transferring to School No. 1 and 18 Uriburu Av. When Fangio was 13, he dropped out of school and worked in Miguel Angel Casas auto mechanics&#x27; workshop as an assistant mechanic. When he was 16, he started riding as a mechanic for his employer&#x27;s customers. He developed pneumonia that almost proved fatal, after a football game where hard running had caused a sharp pain in his chest. He was bed-ridden for two months, cared for by his mother.

After recovering, Fangio served compulsory military service at the age of 21. In 1932 he was enlisted at the Campo de Mayo cadet school near Buenos Aires. His driving skills caught the attention of his commanding officer, who appointed Fangio as his official driver. Fangio was discharged before his 22nd birthday, after taking his final physical examination. He returned to Balcarce where he aimed to further his football career. Along with his friend Jos√© Duffard he received offers to play at a club based in Mar del Plata. Their teammates at Balcarce suggested the two work on Fangio&#x27;s hobby of building his own car, and his parents gave him space to do so in a rudimentary shed at the family home.

==Early racing career==

After finishing his military service, Fangio opened his own garage and raced in local events. He began his racing career in Argentina in 1936, driving a 1929  that he had rebuilt. In the Tourismo Carretera category, Fangio participated in his first race between 18 and 30 October 1938 as the co-driver of Luis Finocchietti. Despite not winning the Argentine Road Grand Prix, Fangio drove most of the way and finished fifth. In November of that year, he entered the &quot;400¬†km of Tres Arroyos&quot;, but it was suspended due to a fatal accident.

During his time racing in Argentina, he drove Chevrolet cars and was Argentine National Champion in 1940 and 1941. One particular race, the 1940 Gran Premio del Norte, was almost 10,000¬†km (6,250¬†mi) long, one that Fangio described as a &quot;terrible ordeal&quot;. This rally-style race started in Buenos Aires on 27 September, and ran up through the Andes and Bolivia to Lima, Peru, and then back to Buenos Aires, taking 15 days, ending on 12 October with stages held each day. This horrendously gruelling race was held in the most difficult and varied conditions imaginable‚Äîdrivers had to traverse through hot and dry deserts, insect-ridden jungles with crushing humidity, freezing cold and sometimes snowy mountain passes with cliff drops at extremely high altitude, sometimes in total darkness, and cold, highly elevated deserts such as the Atacama- all on a mixture of dirt and paved roads- none of which were closed off to the public. Early in the race Fangio hit a large rock and damaged the car&#x27;s driveshaft, which was replaced in the next town. Later on at an overnight stop in Bolivia one of the townspeople crashed into Fangio&#x27;s car and bent an axle‚Äîhe and his co-driver spent all night fixing it. Following this repair the fan blade got loose and punctured the radiator, which meant another repair before it was later replaced. They drove through scorching desert with no water, and during a night stint one of the headlights fell off and they had to be secured with his co-driver&#x27;s necktie. The weather in the Andes mountains and the Atacama was so cold that Fangio drove with his co-driver&#x27;s arms around him for hours. These mountainous routes in Bolivia and Peru sometimes involved going up to altitudes of above sea level‚Äîa 40 percent reduction of air thickness, making breathing incredibly difficult and the engine being severely down on power. When Fangio finally got out of the mountains and back to Buenos Aires, after traversing all these external challenges, he had won the race, which was his first big victory.

In 1941, he beat Oscar G√°lvez in the Grand Prix Get√∫lio Vargas in Brazil, which was a six-day, public road race starting from and ending at Rio de Janeiro, going through various cities and towns all over Brazil such as S√£o Paulo and Belo Horizonte. For the second time, Fangio was crowned champion of Argentine TC. In 1942, he took tenth place in the South Grand Prix. In April he won the race &quot;Mar y Sierras&quot;, and then had to suspend activity due to World War II. In 1946, Fangio returned to racing with two races in Mor√≥n and Tandil driving a Ford¬†T. In February 1947, Fangio competed at National Mechanics (MN) at the Retiro circuit, and on 1 March, he started the race for Rosario City Award. Subsequently, Fangio triumphed in the Double Back Window Race.

In October 1948, Fangio however suffered a personal tragedy in another gruelling race, this time 1948 South American Grand Prix, another point-to-point race from Buenos Aires to Caracas, Venezuela‚Äîa 20-day event covering a distance of through Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and finally Venezuela. In a race that killed 3 spectators and 2 drivers. Fangio, with his co-driver Daniel Urrutia battled hard with brothers Juan and Oscar Galvez, and Domingo Marimon throughout- Fangio was pushing hard to make up lost time he incurred in Argentina. On the 10th day, on the Lima to Tumbes stage in northern Peru, on coastal roads along the Pacific Ocean, Fangio was driving at night in thick fog generated from the ocean in near-pitch black darkness when he approached a left-hand bend at near the village of Huanchaco, not far from the small city of Trujillo. With his car&#x27;s lights not helping him in the thick fog, he approached the bend too fast, lost control of the car and tumbled down an embankment, and Urrutia was thrown out of the car through the front windscreen. Oscar Galvez stopped to help Fangio, who had neck injuries, then soon found the badly injured Urrutia. Another competitor, Luciano Marcilla, stopped and took Fangio and Urrutia to the nearest hospital in the town of Chocope 50¬†km (31¬†mi) away. Fangio survived but 35-year-old Urrutia did not, suffering multiple fatal cervical and basal skull fractures. Domingo Marimon won the race, but the race was a disaster and was marred by the deaths of three spectators and three drivers (including Urrutia). Fangio believed he would never race again and entered a depressed state after the death of his friend, but he recovered, and his successes in Argentina caught the attention of the Argentine Automobile Club and the Juan Peron-led Argentine government, so they bought a Maserati and sent him to Europe in December 1948 to continue his career.

==Formula One and sports car racing==
===Overview===


Fangio was the oldest driver in many of his Formula One races, having started his Grand Prix career in his late 30s. During his career, drivers raced with almost no protective equipment on circuits with no safety features. Formula One cars in the 1950s were for the time not only fast, but very physically and mentally demanding to drive; races were much longer than today and demanded incredible stamina. Tyres were very narrow and cross-ply, and far less forgiving; treads often stripped in a race, and spark plugs fouled. The drivers wore goggles with cloth helmets up to 1952, where from that year on helmets were made mandatory, so they wore pie-shaped crash hats made of paper-mache. The cars had no seatbelts, no roll-over protection, no bodywork to contain the driver (up until 1954) and the front-engined layout of these cars meant that the heated air from the engine and the gearbox would often blast the bodies of the drivers for the hours of the race, with the driveshaft spinning between their legs, and there were, of course, no electronic aids or computer intervention. At the end of a GP, drivers often suffered blistered hands caused by heavy steering and gear changing, and their faces were sometimes covered in soot from the inboard brakes. Despite Fangio&#x27;s short career, he was one of the top GP drivers in history, rivalling Tazio Nuvolari.

Fangio had no compunction about leaving a team, even after a successful year or even during a season, if he thought he would have a better chance with a better car. As was then common, several of his race results were shared with teammates after he took over their car during races when his own had technical problems. His main rivals included Alberto Ascari and Stirling Moss, and on occasion Giuseppe ‚ÄúNino‚Äù Farina and Mike Hawthorn (Farina particularly in the early part of Fangio‚Äôs career). Throughout his career, Fangio was backed by funding from the Argentine government of Juan Per√≥n.

===World championship successes===
Fangio&#x27;s first Grand Prix race was the 1948 French Grand Prix at Reims, where he started his Simca Gordini from 11th on the grid but retired. Fangio briefly returned to South America to compete in the aforementioned Buenos Aires to Caracas race, he then returned to Europe the following year, and raced in Sanremo; having upgraded to a Maserati 4CLT/48 sponsored by the Automobile Club of Argentina he dominated the event, winning both heats to take the aggregate win by almost a minute over Prince Bira. Fangio entered a further six Grand Prix races in 1949, winning four of them against top-level opposition.

====Alfa Romeo and Monza accident====
For the first World Championship of Drivers in 1950, Fangio was taken on by the Alfa Romeo team alongside Farina and Luigi Fagioli. With competitive racing cars following the Second World War still in short supply, the pre-war Alfettas proved dominant. Fangio won each of the three races he finished at Monaco, Spa and Reims-Gueux but Farina&#x27;s three wins at races Fangio retired from and a fourth-place allowed Farina to take the title, even though Fangio was quicker than Farina, who was able to take advantage of Fangio&#x27;s mechanical woes. Fangio&#x27;s most notable victory that year was at Monaco, where he dodged a multi-car pile-up and easily won the race. In 1950s non-championship races Fangio took a further four wins at San Remo, Pau and the fearsome Coppa Acerbo at the 16-mile Pescara public road circuit, and two seconds from eight starts. At Pescara in 1950, going down a long straight called the Flying Kilometer, he was clocked doing 194¬†mph (310¬†km/h) in his Alfa. He also won a handful of races in South America for the Argentine Automobile Club driving a Maserati 4CLT and a Ferrari 166 during the European off-season.

Fangio won three more championship races for Alfa in 1951 in the Swiss, French and Spanish Grands Prix, and with the new 4.5-litre Ferraris taking points off his teammates Farina and various others, Fangio took the title at the final race in Spain, finishing six points ahead of Ascari at the Pedralbes street circuit. Fangio also finished second at the British Grand Prix at Silverstone after his horrendously fuel-inefficient Alfa had to make two lengthy pit stops to refill the car. He then finished second at the German Grand Prix at the N√ºrburgring after he lost first and second gear during an intense battle with Alberto Ascari.

With the 1952 World Championship being run to Formula Two specifications, Alfa Romeo did not have a car for the new formula and were unable to use their supercharged Alfettas, so they withdrew. As a result, the defending champion found himself without a car for the first race of the championship and remained absent from F1 until June, when he drove the British BRM V16 in non-championship F1 races at the public road circuits at Albi in France and Dundrod in Northern Ireland. Fangio had agreed to drive for Maserati in a non-championship race at Monza the day after the Dundrod race, but having missed a connecting flight he decided to drive through the night on pre-motorway mountain roads through the Alps from Lyon, arriving half an hour before the start. Arriving at Monza at 2 p.m., he was badly fatigued and with the race starting at 2:30¬†p.m., Fangio started the race from the back of the grid but lost control on the second lap, crashed into a grass bank, and was thrown out of the car as it flipped end over end, smashing through trees. He was taken to a hospital in Milan with multiple injuries, the most serious being a broken neck, and spent the rest of 1952 recovering in Argentina. Nino Farina, who had won the race, visited Fangio in hospital and gifted him with the winner&#x27;s laurel wreath.

====Maserati and sports car racing successes====
Having returned to Europe and back to full racing fitness in 1953, Fangio rejoined Maserati for the championship season, and against the dominant Ferraris led by Ascari he took a lucky win at Monza. Fangio&#x27;s car had a bad vibration all throughout practice, and he offered the Maserati mechanics 10% of his winnings if they fixed the vibration; they did, and Fangio qualified second, and won the race, setting fastest lap and beating Nino Farina by just 1.4 seconds. Along with that win, Fangio secured three second-places to finish second in the Championship, and also came third first time out in the Targa Florio. He also competed and won one of two heats in the Albi Grand Prix, again with BRM and driving the fearsome and powerful Type 15, a car with a 600¬†hp supercharged V16 that was difficult to drive.

He also competed in one of the most dangerous and prestigious races in Europe: the Mille Miglia, a race on open public roads covering nearly all of northern Italy driving an Alfa Romeo 6C 3000 CM entered by the factory. The Mille Miglia and also another championship race in 1953, the Carrera Panamericana in Mexico were much like the races he competed in South America in the 1940s (except all the roads used in Italy and Mexico were paved). At the Mille Miglia, the Alfa team was expected to win, and after Farina, Karl Kling and Consalvo Sanesi all crashed, Fangio was leading when he reached Rome, pushing very hard from when he started in Brescia. Fangio then suffered left front steering arm failure near Bologna and only had consistent steering on the right front; this allowed Mille Miglia expert Giannino Marzotto to catch and beat Fangio by 12 minutes, even though the Argentine driver drove hard to keep up with Marzotto. He ended 1953 by winning the dauntingly dangerous and difficult 2,000¬†mi (3,200¬†km) Carrera Panamericana in Mexico driving a Lancia D24; Fangio was able to win this 5-day open public road rally that started at the Guatemala-Mexico border and ended at the Mexico-United States border in Ciudad Juarez, setting a new race time completion record of 18.5 hours (despite Fangio not winning a single stage), some 9 hours faster than the winner of the first event in 1950. The race was marred by multiple spectator fatalities, and the death of 50-year-old Felice Bonetto, like Fangio driving a works Lancia, on the third day of the competition in the town of Silao.

====Mercedes-Benz====

In 1954 Fangio raced for Maserati until Mercedes-Benz entered competition in mid-season. He won his home Grand Prix in Buenos Aires and at Spa with the iconic 250F. Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s first race was the French Grand Prix at the fast, straight dominated Reims public road circuit, and he won the race with the streamlined, closed-wheel W196 Monoposto- a car that although difficult to drive was ahead of its time. Fangio spent the race battling with teammate Karl Kling down Reims&#x27;s long straights. Fangio failed to win at Silverstone, with the closed-wheel car designed for straight-line speed struggling at the high speed corner-dominated circuit. Fangio got the more nimble open-wheeled W196 for the N√ºrburgring, and won the race, as he did at Bremgarten and then at Monza, the latter with the streamlined car. Monza was a particularly brutal race in that Alberto Ascari had turned up with the new Lancia, and young British up-and-comer Stirling Moss in a private Maserati was also competitive during the race. Ascari and Moss both passed Fangio and raced each other hard until Ascari dropped out with engine problems. Moss&#x27;s engine blew up near the end of the race and Fangio took victory. Winning eight out of twelve races (six out of eight in the championship) and winning his second championship in that year, he continued to race with Mercedes‚Äîdriving a further developed W196 with improved performance in 1955 in a team that included Moss.

For 1955, Fangio subjected himself to a training programme which was strenuous in an effort to keep up his fitness levels high which was comparable to his younger rivals. He won a particularly brutal race at the Gran Premio de la Rep√∫blica Argentina. This race was run in Buenos Aires during a gruelling heat wave, and with track temperature of over few drivers other than Fangio were able to complete the race. The W196&#x27;s chassis had heated up and Fangio&#x27;s right leg rubbed against the chassis structure, but even after receiving severe burns he kept going; it took him three months to recover from his injuries. 1955 also saw Fangio attempt the Mille Miglia again, this time without a navigator, driving a Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR. After leaving at 6:58¬†a.m., the car&#x27;s advanced engine began developing problems when he got to Pescara. The Mercedes mechanics apparently found nothing, and sent him off. Fangio was losing time to Moss and Hans Herrmann, and when he got to Rome the engine was still not running smoothly. Again Fangio was sent away by the mechanics. And when he got to Florence, a few loud bangs were heard, so the mechanics raised the bonnet and they found that one of the fuel injection pipes had broken, so Fangio&#x27;s 300 SLR was running on seven cylinders instead of eight; this could not be repaired and Fangio drove back to Brescia with a misfiring engine, finishing in 2nd behind Moss. Fangio later surmised that Mercedes felt he could not win the race without a navigator so they did not put as much effort behind preparing his car as they did with the car of Moss, who had a navigator. At the end of the second successful season (which was overshadowed by the 1955 Le Mans disaster in which 83 spectators were killed, an accident which happened right in front of and nearly killed him) Mercedes withdrew from racing and after four attempts, Fangio never raced at Le Mans again. A number of races were cancelled after this race except for Britain and Italy (which both already had circuits with new and updated safety facilities), which he finished in second in the former and won the latter, allowing him to win his third world championship. Mercedes&#x27;s last race was the Targa Florio sportscar race, which Mercedes needed to win in order to beat Ferrari and Jaguar to the title; the German firm had skipped the first two races in Buenos Aires and Sebring, Florida. Fangio, driving with Kling finished second to Moss and Peter Collins, allowing Mercedes to win the title by two points over Ferrari.

====Last years with Ferrari and Maserati====
In 1956 Fangio moved to Ferrari to win his fourth title. Neither Enzo Ferrari nor the Ferrari team manager Eraldo Sculati had a warm relationship with Fangio, despite their shared success with the very difficult-to-drive Ferrari-developed Lancia car. Fangio started the year strongly by winning the gruelling 12-hour sportscar race at Sebring in America with Ferrari, driving with Eugenio Castellotti. But during the Grand Prix season, Fangio took over his teammate&#x27;s cars after he suffered mechanical problems in three races, the Argentine, Monaco and Italian Grands Prix. In each case the points were shared between the two drivers. After the Monaco Grand Prix, where Fangio struggled with the ill-handling Lancia-Ferrari he asked Ferrari if he could have one mechanic exclusively for his car, as Ferrari did not have his mechanics assigned to any of the cars, as Mercedes had. Ferrari granted Fangio&#x27;s request, and the performance of Fangio&#x27;s car improved substantially. In addition to winning in Argentina, Fangio won the British and German Grands Prix at Silverstone and the N√ºrburgring. At the season-ending Italian Grand Prix, Fangio&#x27;s Ferrari teammate Peter Collins, who was in a position to win the World Championship with just 15 laps to go, handed over his car to Fangio. They shared the six points won for second place, giving Fangio the World title.

In 1957 Fangio returned to Maserati, who were still using the same iconic 250F which Fangio had driven at the start of 1954. Fangio started the season with a hat-trick of wins in Argentina, Monaco and France, before retiring with engine problems in Britain. He also won the Sebring sportscar race in driving a Maserati 450S with Jean Behra for the second year running. But at the Grand Prix after Britain, the German Grand Prix at the N√ºrburgring circuit, Fangio needed to extend his lead by six points to claim the title with two races to spare. From pole position Fangio dropped to third behind the Ferraris of Mike Hawthorn and Collins but managed to get past both by the end of the third lap. Fangio had started with half-full tanks since he expected that he would need new tyres halfway through the race. In the event Fangio pitted on lap 13 with a 30-second lead, but a disastrous stop left him back in third place and 50 seconds behind Collins and Hawthorn. Fangio came into his own, setting one fastest lap after another, culminating in a record-breaking time on lap 20 a full eleven seconds faster than the best the Ferraris could do. On the penultimate lap Fangio got back past both Collins and Hawthorn, and held on to take the win by just over three seconds. With Musso finishing in fourth place, Fangio claimed his fifth title. This performance is often regarded as one of the greatest drives in Formula One history, and it was also Fangio&#x27;s final victory in the sport. Fangio&#x27;s record of five championships remained unbroken until 2003, when Michael Schumacher won his sixth championship.

After his series of consecutive championships he retired in 1958, following the French Grand Prix. Such was the respect for Fangio that during that final race, race leader Hawthorn, who had lapped Fangio, braked as he was about to cross the line so that Fangio could complete the 50-lap distance in his final race; he crossed the line over two minutes down on Hawthorn. Getting out of the Maserati after the race, he said to his mechanic simply, &quot;It is finished.&quot; He was famous for winning races at what he described as the slowest possible speed, in order to conserve the car to the finish. Cars in the 1940s and 1950s were unpredictable in their reliability, with almost any component susceptible to breaking. He won 24 World Championship Grands Prix, 22 outright and two shared with other drivers, from 52 entries ‚Äì a winning percentage of 46.15%, the highest in the sport&#x27;s history (Alberto Ascari, who has the second-highest, holds a winning percentage of 40.63%). Both drivers were already experienced Grand Prix drivers before the world championship started.

==Kidnapping==
President Fulgencio Batista of Cuba established the non-Formula One Cuban Grand Prix in Havana in 1957. Fangio won the 1957 event, and had set fastest times during practice for the 1958 race. On 23 February 1958, two gunmen of Fidel Castro&#x27;s 26th of July Movement entered the Hotel Lincoln in Havana and kidnapped Fangio. Batista ordered the race to continue as usual while a crack team of police hunted down the kidnappers. They set up roadblocks at intersections, and guards were assigned to private and commercial airports and to all competing drivers.

Fangio was taken to three separate houses. His captors allowed him to listen to the race via radio, bringing a television for him to witness reports of a disastrous crash after the race concluded. In the third house, Fangio was allowed his own bedroom but became convinced that a guard was standing outside the bedroom door at all hours. The captors talked about their revolutionary programme, which Fangio had not wished to speak about, as he did not have an interest in politics. He later said: &quot;Well, this is one more adventure. If what the rebels did was in a good cause, then I, as an Argentine, accept it.&quot; He was released after 29 hours, after being &quot;treated very well&quot;.

The captors&#x27; motives were to force the cancellation of the race in an attempt to embarrass the Batista regime. When Fangio was handed over to the Argentine embassy soon after the race, many Cubans became convinced that Batista was losing his grip on power because he failed to track the captors down. The Cuban Revolution took over the government in January 1959, and the 1959 Cuban Grand Prix was cancelled. The Fangio kidnapping was dramatized in a 1999 Argentine film directed by Alberto Lecchi, &quot;Operaci√≥n Fangio&quot;.

==Later life and death==

=== Post-retirement activities ===

In the early 1950s, Fangio was involved in a road accident when he was forced to swerve to avoid an oncoming truck. The car, a Lancia Aurelia GT, clipped a pole, spinning twice and threw Fangio out, which led him to sustain grazed elbows. One passenger stated the incident was the first time Fangio had been so terrified.

When Fangio attended the 1958 Indianapolis 500, he was offered $20,000 to qualify in a Kurtis-Offenhauser by the car&#x27;s owner, George Walther, Jr (father of future Indy 500 driver Salt Walther). Fangio had previously attended the 500 in 1948 at which time he expressed his interest in competing the race. However, he was unable to qualify with a car that did not work properly. Walther allowed Fangio to stand aside (before a contract with BP came to light), still he did not want another driver to take over Fangio&#x27;s position.

After his retirement, Fangio was distinguished as honorary President of the Automobile Sports Commission of the Argentine Republic. He also participated in many world exhibition races, tributes to motorsport figures and in the organization of events related to his profession. In 1960 he carried out an exhibition at the Sarmiento Park in C√≥rdoba city, with a Maserati 2500 of Ettore Chimeri, with which he suffered a run off the track, brushed a curb and accidentally lifted into the air without consequences. He became honorary president of the Club International des Anciens Pilotes de Grand Prix F1 in 1962.

In 1968, he collaborated with Autom√≥vil Club Argentino in the organization of the Formula 2 International Championship held in Argentina, a task that would become constant during the following years. Shortly thereafter, he headed the &quot;84 Hours of N√ºrburgring&quot; project for Argentine-made IKA-Renault Torino cars and traveled to Germany as a driver advisor with the Argentine team.

Fangio took part in the so-called &quot;Carrera del Recuerdo&quot;, held on 17 October 1973 at the Aut√≥dromo de Buenos Aires with a Fiat Berlina 125. Legendary motorsport figures such as Oscar Alfredo G√°lvez also took part in the race.

Fangio served as the flagman for the Argentine Grand Prix from 1972 to 1981, and for NASCAR&#x27;s Winston 500 in 1975.

He was appointed president of Mercedes-Benz Argentina in April 1974 and the following year, he was part of an exhibition test in Dijon on the occasion of the Swiss Grand Prix aboard a Maserati 250F. On the 50th anniversary of the N√ºrburgring circuit, Fangio took part in the Fifth International Race of Historic Racing and Sports Cars, called &quot;Parade of Remembrance&quot;, with the Mercedes-Benz W196 R. In 1979 he raced at the English circuit of Donington Park on the occasion of an event organized by the Gunnar Nilsson Foundation.

Fangio was the special guest of the 50th anniversary 1978 Australian Grand Prix at the Sandown Raceway in Melbourne (seven years before the Australian Grand Prix became a round of the World Championship in ). After awarding the Lex Davison Trophy to race winner Graham McRae (who stated that meeting Fangio was a bigger thrill than actually winning the race for the third time), Fangio drove his 1954 and 1955 World Championship-winning Mercedes-Benz W196 in a spirited three lap exhibition against three other cars, including the World Championship winning Brabham BT19 driven by Australia&#x27;s own triple World Champion Jack Brabham. Despite his car being over ten years older than the Repco Brabham, Fangio pushed the Australian all the way to the flag. Before the event, Fangio (who at 67 years of age and not having raced competitively in 20 years, still held a full FIA Super Licence) had stated his intention of racing and not just putting in a demonstration drive.

After racing in the Brussels Rally in 1981, he participated aboard a Chevrolet TC in the Gran Premio del Recuerdo, a caravan held in 1983 through the center of the Buenos Aires city to raise funds for the Patronato de la Infancia and the Asociaci√≥n de Ayuda al Menor of the Buenos Aires province.

In 1980, Konex Foundation granted him the Diamond Konex Award as the best Sportsman of the decade in Argentina. In 1981 Fangio travelled to Monza for the Italian Grand Prix, where he was reunited with his Tipo 159 Alfa Romeo from 1951 and the 1954 Lancia D50 for a couple of demonstrative laps. For the event Fangio was joined by old friends and fellow racers, including Toulo de Graffenried, Luigi Villoresi and Giorgio Scarlatti as well as former Alfa Romeo managers from the 1950s Paolo Marzotto and Battista Guidotti.

Fangio was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1990. He returned to the spotlight in 1994, when he publicly opposed a new Province of Buenos Aires law denying driving licences to those over 80 (which included Fangio). Denied a renewal of his card, Fangio reportedly challenged Traffic Bureau personnel to a race between Buenos Aires and seaside Mar del Plata (a 400¬†km (250¬†mi) distance) in two hours or less, following which an exception was made for the five-time champion.

In 1990, Fangio met Ayrton Senna, a Brazilian three-time world champion, who genuinely felt the encounter reflected the mutual affection of both drivers.

He was appointed honorary president of Mercedes-Benz Argentina in 1987, the only distinction granted in its history by the German company, and held the position until 1994. Fangio was appointed president of the Renault Foundation in 1990 and continued to make public appearances especially in international exhibition races until his health began to deteriorate. He held his last competition on the Sardinia Island in 1993 aboard an Alfetta 159 in the company of other figures of his time.

===His role at Mercedes-Benz during the Argentine military dictatorship===

On the centenary of his birth in 2011, two projects were presented in the Legislature of the City of Buenos Aires by the PRO to honor him, which were resisted by both the Buenos Aires Deputy Ombudsman&#x27;s Office and by the representative Delia Bisutti, who pointed out that &quot;a claim is being made for Fangio in its entirety and someone of his renown could not be oblivious to what was happening. &quot;Here there was a military dictatorship with civic accompaniment, and it is very important to highlight what happened to Fangio.&quot; Fernando de Andreis, the deputy who presented the project, dismissed the accusation, stating that it was unfounded. Graciela Borges, widow of Juan Manuel Bordeu, also defended Fangio, arguing that the visit to Venezuela made by the broker in the 70s would have been made with any other government.

====Juan Manuel Fangio Motorsport Museum====

In 1979, some residents of the city of Balcarce began to promote the formation of a work commission to the construction of a Museum when they learned of Fangio&#x27;s intention to gather all his trophies, cars and presents accumulated throughout his life sports in one place. On 26 October of that year, the &quot;Juan Manuel Fangio Motorsport Pro-Museum Commission&quot; was established under municipal support.

An old building from 1906, in which the Municipality and the Deliberative Council of Balcarce had functioned, was chosen to establish the museum. Although the building had been closed for years, and was in a deplorable state of conservation, it occupied a lot of significant proportions and was located in the southern corner of the town&#x27;s main square. The community history of the building generated a desire to recover it as the city&#x27;s architectural heritage.

Aware at the end of 1980 of the proposal of the Pro-museum Commission, Province of Buenos Aires &quot;De facto&quot; Governor, Ib√©rico Saint Jean, promoted it and provided the initial capital that made the bidding and the beginnings possible. of the work.

The economic contributions, which given the inflationary process was close to 18% of the cost (at the beginning it represented 75%-80%), was expanded with donations from national and international companies, people adhering to the project, contributions from Fangio himself and was completed with different activities organized by the commission.

The former racer donated all his trophies and a wide variety of automobiles to the municipality of Balcarce in 1983 for later presentation at the Museum. Finally, on 22 November 1986, the Juan Manuel Fangio Technological-Cultural Center and Automobile Museum was inaugurated.

The restoration of the building and its contents caused astonishment among visitors and world journalists, leading it to be described as the most important motorsports museum in South America and the best dedicated to a competitive driver.

Upon concluding its objective, the Pro-Museum Commission was dissolved. However, at the request of Fangio and Juan Manuel Bordeu, the Juan Manuel Fangio Automobile Museum Foundation was created, an entity that manages and governs the destiny of the museum and is responsible for preserving, maintaining and increasing Fangio&#x27;s sports heritage.

===Decreased health and death===

The former racer&#x27;s health deteriorated in the last decades of his life. In December 1970, he suffered a serious heart attack and in 1981, after exhibiting a Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR in Dubai, he had another heart attack. The following year he was subjected to a surgical intervention in which the renowned Cardiologist Doctor Ren√© Favaloro implanted five &quot;bypass&quot;.

In the late 1980s he was diagnosed with chronic kidney failure and in 1992, he underwent surgery to remove a benign tumor from his kidneys. He suffered an intestinal infection in 1993 in Stuttgart, for which he had to be hospitalized. At the end of that year he had to be admitted again for fifteen days to the Mater Dei Clinic due to blood hypercalcemia. In his last years he had to undergo three weekly sessions of dialysis by Doctor Roque Sala at the same time that he began with a progressive loss of consciousness and motor problems derived from his previous pathologies. After an emergency hospitalization in January 1995, he confined himself to his home in Palermo Viejo, where he continued with treatment and abandoned practically all his public appearances.

On 14 July 1995, he suffered from respiratory failure with excess phlegm that led to his admission to the Mater Dei Clinic, where he was diagnosed with bronchopneumonia. One day later he had a respiratory crisis and his diagnosis worsened on 16 July when he suffered a decompensation in his state of health that until then had remained stable. Fangio died on 17 July 1995 at 84 years old at 4:10 AM UTC-3 in Buenos Aires.

After learning of the death of the former racer, President of the Nation Argentina Carlos Sa√∫l Menem arranged the White Room of the Casa Rosada for his funeral. His pallbearers were his younger brother Ruben Renato (&quot;Toto&quot;), fellow racing icons Stirling Moss and Jackie Stewart, compatriot champions Jos√© Froil√°n Gonz√°lez and Carlos Reutemann, and the president of Mercedes-Benz Argentina at the time.

The president of FIFA, Jo√£o Havelange, expressed his condolences and Jackie Stewart, three-time Formula 1 world champion and personal friend of Fangio, decided to travel for the funeral. The president of the FIA, Max Mosley, immediately traveled to Argentina upon learning of Fangio&#x27;s death.

After the first funeral at the Casa Rosada, the remains of the former racer were transferred for a new funeral at the headquarters of the Autom√≥vil Club Argentino and then a last funera√± was held at the Fangio Museum before finally being placed in the family pantheon of the Balcarce Cemetery.

In 2021, the remains of the racer were moved from the Balcarce Cemetery to the Museum that bears his name, in the same city where he was born and grew up more than 110 years ago, being the culmination of a ceremony that lasted two days full of tributes to Fangio, coinciding also with the 70th anniversary of his first Formula 1 victory. The ceremony was attended by Oscar ‚ÄúCacho‚Äù, Ruben and Juan Carlos, the three sons of the quintuple, together with outstanding national and world motorsport personalities such as Sir Jackie Stewart, Oreste Berta and Horacio Pagani, who were also Fangio&#x27;s friends. After the Roman Catholic religious service, officiated by the Mar del Plata&#x27;s Bishop, the coffin with the remains of the former racer was placed in a special vault in the Museum, next to the trophies he won and some of the cars with which he had his successful racing career.

===Personal life===
Fangio never married, but was romantically involved for more than twenty years with Andrea ‚ÄúBeba‚Äù Berruet, with whom he had a son on April 6, 1938: Oscar ‚ÄúCacho‚Äù Espinoza. He was registered with the surname of Berruet&#x27;s husband, Luis Alcides Espinoza, because they were not legally separated, since at that time civil divorce did not yet exist in Argentina.

The relationship between Berruet and Fangio did not last beyond the racer&#x27;s sporting retirement in the early 1960s, but shortly before, in 1955, Fangio began legal proceedings for the adoption of his own eldest son, something he abandoned shortly thereafter.

Oscar Espinoza&#x27;s first opportunity to try to get his real last name was in 1966. &quot;Cacho&quot;, who against his father&#x27;s wishes (Fangio wanted his son to study medicine at University) became a racing driver, had the opportunity to go racing in the European Formula Two Championship. Because he had to renew his passport to travel to Europe, and the renewal process was delayed, Juan Manuel told his son that the only chance to get his passport renewed as quickly as possible was to add the surname Fangio to his Identity Card, and that was how it was given. Thus began his professional career in motorsport as &quot;Cacho&quot; Fangio, although it was known that this was only a patch and not a concrete reality.

&quot;Cacho&quot; even participated in the Argentine Mission, organized by his father, of the 84 Hours of N√ºrburgring in August 1969, where national cars IKA Torino, prepared by the renowned mechanic Oreste Berta, competed.

In the 1970s, the relationship between Fangio and his eldest son deteriorated almost completely because &quot;Cacho&quot; began to demand that his father give him his real last name. Espinoza filed a filiation lawsuit against Juan Manuel Fangio, repudiating Luis Alcides Espinoza&#x27;s paternity. The lawsuit was rejected in First and Second Instance by the National Civil Court of the Capital Federal. Fangio and his son stopped talking to each other for many years. Even, in the homage that the President of the Nation Argentina Carlos Sa√∫l Menem paid to the former racer in 1994 for the 25th anniversary of the 84 Hours of N√ºrburgring 1969, they met again and only shook hands. The following year, with Fangio&#x27;s health deteriorating, they met again at the racer&#x27;s home in Buenos Aires, where father and son were able to reconcile and have a quiet chat, being the last time Fangio was able to see his eldest son, shortly time before his death.

In 2000, Espinoza publicly admitted in an interview to &quot;Ol√©&quot; that he was the former racer&#x27;s unrecognized son and in 2008 he initiated a case in a Buenos Aires civil court to prove his filiation and to be able to use his paternal surname.

After Fangio&#x27;s death, it was ‚ÄúCacho&#x27;s‚Äù youngest daughter, Carolina, who urged her father to continue with the parentage claim even though the former racer was no longer physically present. Espinoza stopped the filiation claim because his daughter, who had urged him to continue with the claim, died of Cancer in 2011. &quot;Cacho&quot; was plunged into sadness by the death of his daughter and only two years later was he able to resume the search for his true identity.

In 2005, Rub√©n Juan V√°zquez, a former railway and hotelier employee born in Balcarce and currently residing in the town of Ca√±uelas, filed a paternity suit similar to the one already filed by ‚ÄúCacho‚Äù Espinoza to find out if he is indeed also Fangio&#x27;s son. Born 4 years after Espinoza (on June 25, 1942, the day after Fangio&#x27;s 31st birthday), V√°zquez claimed to be the fruit of an extramarital relationship between his mother, Catalina Basili, and Fangio, whom he met when Rub√©n&#x27;s maternal half-brother, Ricardo V√°zquez, suffered an accident while working in the mechanical workshop that the racer owned in Balcarce. The extramarital relationship between Basili and Fangio that later resulted in the pregnancy was a secret that not even Pedro Antonio V√°zquez, Basili&#x27;s husband, knew about during his lifetime. Fangio was V√°zquez&#x27;s baptismal godfather, and even at one point, at that time without knowing or suspecting that he was his biological father, he turned to the former racer to ask for a recommendation to go to work at Mercedes Benz, due to the difference salaries since they paid better salaries in the automotive industry than in the Railway, where V√°zquez worked at that time.

Rub√©n&#x27;s first suspicion about his true identity arose in 1995 when he worked in a Hotel in Pinamar. A doctor, a client of the Hotel, who noticed V√°zquez&#x27;s physical resemblance to Fangio told him that when he took a DNA test he was going to get a surprise.

After ten years and after receiving more comments that he was similar to Fangio not only physically but also in his voice, in 2005 V√°zquez decided to confront his mother to find out the truth about whether or not he was the son of the former racer, although she was still weighed down by the extramarital relationship she had had with the ‚ÄúChueco‚Äù decades ago. After several refusals, Basili finally confessed the truth to his son. V√°zquez turned to the Law firm of the renowned Lawyer Miguel √Ångel Pierri and his partner, Lisandro Faisal, who initiated the filiation case that would determine if V√°zquez was indeed Fangio&#x27;s son.

Catalina Basili died in December 2012, at 103 years old, but shortly before her death she had signed a deed before a Notary Public admitting that her son was the fruit of a relationship with Fangio.

In order to initially follow up on the filiation lawsuit filed by Espinoza, on July 16, 2015, the Civil and Commercial Judge of Mar del Plata, Rodrigo Cataldo, ordered the exhumation of Fangio&#x27;s body from the Municipal Cemetery of Balcarce, which took place on August 7 of the same year. After the exhumation and in order to extract samples from the racer&#x27;s remains, experts sent by the Civil and Commercial Judge of La Plata, Daniel Dipp, who was in charge of Rub√©n V√°zquez&#x27;s filiation case, were also present. The samples were sent to laboratories in La Plata, where they were compared with the blood samples of Espinoza and V√°zquez In December 2015, the Court confirmed that Espinosa was indeed Fangio&#x27;s son, and in February 2016, it was confirmed that Rub√©n V√°zquez was also Fangio&#x27;s son.

In June 2016, Juan Carlos Rodr√≠guez, a retired Agricultural Engineer, born in 1945 in Balcarce and currently residing in the same City, underwent an initial DNA study with Oscar Fangio, who had known each other for more than three decades, although at that time both did not know they were brothers, because although Rodr√≠guez knew that his father was Juan Manuel, ‚ÄúCacho‚Äù believed that Rodr√≠guez was the son of Rub√©n Renato Aniceto Fangio, ‚ÄúToto‚Äù, the younger brother of the racer and father of the also racing driver Juan Manuel Fangio II.

Juan Carlos was the fruit of a brief relationship between Silvia Rodriguez, who was fifteen years old at the time, and the racer, who was already thirty-three years old.The genetic result between Rodriguez and Cacho Fangio was that they are brothers with a certainty of almost 98%, which would lead to the conclusion that Rodriguez would also be the son of Juan Manuel, although the next step was still missing, which was to perform the same study by matching the DNA samples of Rodriguez with those extracted from the remains of the ‚ÄúChueco‚Äù.‚Äú

In May 2021 DNA studies confirmed that Juan Carlos Rodriguez is also Fangio&#x27;s son.

In June 2018, Oscar and Rub√©n Fangio became the heirs of the multimillion-dollar fortune that their father amassed during his years in motorsport, thus displacing their cousins, the former racer&#x27;s nephews, who had been left with most of the material assets after Fangio&#x27;s death. Some time later, the youngest of the three Fangio brothers, Juan Carlos, joined as the third heir to the fortune.

His nephew, Juan Manuel Fangio II, is also a racing driver.

==Legacy==
Fangio&#x27;s record of five World Championship titles stood for 46 years until German driver Michael Schumacher surpassed it in 2003. Schumacher said, &quot;Fangio is on a level much higher than I see myself. What he did stands alone and what we have achieved is also unique. I have such respect for what he achieved. You can&#x27;t take a personality like Fangio and compare him with what has happened today. There is not even the slightest comparison.&quot; When Lewis Hamilton equaled Fangio&#x27;s five titles in 2018 he praised Fangio calling him the &quot;Godfather of our sport&quot;.

In October 2020, &quot;The Economist&quot; ranked champion drivers by the relative importance of car quality to driver skill. According to this ranking, Fangio is Formula 1&#x27;s best driver of all time.

In November 2020, Carteret Analytics used quantitative analysis methods to rank Formula One drivers.¬†According to this ranking, Fangio is Formula 1&#x27;s best driver of all time. Similar mathematical analysis has also placed Fangio as the greatest of all time, once the era of racing was considered.

In his home country of Argentina, Fangio is revered as one of the greatest sportsmen the nation has ever produced. He is nicknamed &quot;El Maestro&quot; (the master).

Six statues of Fangio, sculpted by Catalan artist Joaquim Ros Sabat√©, stand at race venues around the world: Puerto Madero, Buenos Aires; Monte Carlo, Monaco; Montmel√≥, Spain; N√ºrburgring, Germany; Stuttgart-Untert√ºrkheim, Germany; and Monza, Italy.

The &quot;Museo Juan Manuel Fangio&quot; was established in Balcarce (Fangio&#x27;s birthplace) in 1986.

Argentina&#x27;s largest oil company, Repsol YPF, launched the &quot;Fangio XXI&quot; gas brand. The Zonda 2005 C12 F, also known as the Zonda Fangio, was designed in honour of Fangio and was released 10 years after his death. Maserati created a special website in 2007 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his fifth and final world championship triumph. A Mercedes-Benz W196R Formula 1 race car, driven by Fangio in his World Championship-qualifying Grand Prix races in 1954 and 1955 was sold for a record $30 million at an auction in England on 12 July 2013.

<doc id="48535" wikidata="Q1455053" url="?curid=48535" title="Pennsylvania Avenue">
<text>Pennsylvania Avenue is a primarily diagonal street in Washington, D.C. that connects the United States Capitol with the White House and then crosses northwest Washington, D.C. to Georgetown. Traveling through southeast Washington from the Capitol, it enters Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, and becomes MD Route 4 (MD 4) and then MD Route 717 in Upper Marlboro, and finally Stephanie Roper Highway.

The section of the avenue between the White House, which is sometimes referred to by its address &quot;1600 Pennsylvania Avenue&quot;, and the Capitol forms the basis for the Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site and is sometimes referred to as &quot;America&#x27;s Main Street&quot;; it is the location of official parades and processions, and periodic protest marches. Pennsylvania Avenue is an important commuter road and is part of the National Highway System.

==Route==
The avenue runs for in Washington, D.C., but the of Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House to the United States Capitol building is far and away the most famed section of the avenue. It continues within the city for , from the southeast corner of the Capitol grounds through the Capitol Hill neighborhood, and over the Anacostia River on the John Philip Sousa Bridge. Crossing most of Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, it ends from the Washington, D.C. border in Maryland at the junction with MD 717 in Upper Marlboro, where the name changes to Stephanie Roper Highway, for a total length of . Stephanie Roper Highway used to be Pennsylvania Avenue, but was renamed in 2012. In addition to its street names, in Maryland it is designated as Maryland Route 4.

Northwest of the White House, Pennsylvania Avenue runs for to its end at M Street N.W. in Georgetown, just beyond the Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge over Rock Creek. From 1862 to 1962, streetcars ran the length of the avenue from Georgetown to the Anacostia River.

== History ==

===18th century===
Although Pennsylvania Avenue extends six miles (10¬†km) in Washington, D.C., the expanse between the White House and the United States Capitol constitutes the ceremonial heart of the nation. It was designed by Pierre Charles L&#x27;Enfant, and was one of the earliest streets constructed in the city. The width of the avenue was set at 160 feet, identical to the narrowest points of the Champs Elysees in Paris that L&#x27;Enfant is likely to have examined. The first documented reference to the street as Pennsylvania Avenue was in a 1791 letter from Thomas Jefferson. One theory behind the avenue&#x27;s name is that it was named for Pennsylvania as consolation for moving the capital from Philadelphia in 1800 and in recognition of Pennsylvania&#x27;s historical significance in the nation&#x27;s founding. Both Jefferson and Washington considered Pennsylvania Avenue an important feature of the new capital. The stretch outside the White House was established in 1804 when President Jefferson ordered the road to be cut through President&#x27;s Park. For decades, Pennsylvania Avenue was a wide dirt road ridiculed by Jefferson as &quot;The Great Serbonian Bog&quot;, he planted it with rows of fast-growing &quot;Populus nigra&quot;.

===19th century===

In 1832, in an effort to tame dust and dirt on Pennsylvania Avenue, it was paved using the macadam method. But over the years, other pavement methods were trialed on the avenue: cobblestones in 1849 followed by Belgian blocks and then, in 1871, wooden blocks.

Pennsylvania Avenue once provided an unobstructed view between the White House and the Capitol. The construction of an expansion to the Treasury Building blocked this view, and supposedly President Andrew Jackson did this on purpose. Relations between the president and Congress were strained, and Jackson did not want to see the Capitol out his window, though in reality the Treasury Building was simply built on what was cheap government land.

In 1876, as part of an initiative begun by President Ulysses S. Grant to see the city&#x27;s streets improved, Pennsylvania Avenue was paved with asphalt by Civil War veteran William Averell using Trinidad and Guanoco lakes asphalt.

===20th century===

In 1959, Pennsylvania Avenue was extended from the Washington, D.C. border with Maryland to Dower House Road in Upper Marlboro, Maryland.

On September 30, 1965, portions of the avenue and surrounding area were designated the Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site. The National Park Service administers this area which includes the United States Navy Memorial, Old Post Office Tower, and Pershing Park. After the Great Depression in the 1930s and the move of affluent families to suburbs in the 1950s, Pennsylvania Avenue became increasingly blighted. John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson tried to redevelop the street as part of the New Frontier and Great Society reforms, but the avenue further declined after the 1968 Washington, D.C., riots in the aftermath of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.

In 1972, Congress created the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation (PADC) to rehabilitate the street between the Capitol and the White House, an area seen as blighted. The new organization was given the mandate of developing Pennsylvania Avenue &quot;in a manner suitable to its ceremonial, physical, and historic relationship to the legislative and executive branches of the federal government&quot;.

In the 1980s, renovations were made to the Willard Hotel, the Old Post Office, and Washington Union Station, each located on or adjacent to Pennsylvania Avenue.

===21st century===
In 2010, the District of Columbia designated Pennsylvania Avenue from the southwestern terminus of John Philip Sousa Bridge to the Maryland state line to be a &quot;D.C. Great Street&quot;. The city spent $430 million to beautify the street and improve the roadway.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses along Pennsylvania Avenue faced significant challenges and closures. With reduced tourism, remote work trends keeping office buildings quieter, and a historical lack of the avenue itself being a primary destination, many establishments struggled to sustain operations. The combination of decreased foot traffic and shifting consumer behavior further strained local businesses, leading to closures as they struggled to adapt to the new economic realities.

In 2022, the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) launched the Pennsylvania Avenue Initiative to revitalize the iconic thoroughfare by transforming it into a dynamic public space and transportation corridor. Accelerated by the changes brought about by remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic, the initiative aims to re-imagine Pennsylvania Avenue from its current eight-lane design predominantly catering to cars to a more inclusive and equitable space. This vision includes accommodating a variety of activities and users, such as pedestrians, cyclists, buses, emergency vehicles, and delivery trucks, alongside hosting events and fostering community engagement.

To achieve this transformation, the initiative involves collaborative efforts between NCPC and consulting teams like HR&amp;A Advisors. They are tasked with updating traffic studies to explore reallocating roadway space for new sidewalks, bike lanes, transit-only lanes, mid-block crossings, and other streetscape elements. Additionally, the initiative prioritizes refining early design concepts into preferred alternatives based on economic feasibility, stakeholder input, and environmental considerations. Ultimately, the goal is to elevate Pennsylvania Avenue&#x27;s status as a premier public space in Washington, DC, comparable to other renowned urban boulevards around the world.

In 2024, NCPC is expected to announce a second consultant team to help develop the New Pennsylvania Avenue Plan that will address design and infrastructure improvements along the corridor and adjoining public spaces.

===Parades and protests===
====Presidential inaugurations====

Ever since an impromptu procession formed around Jefferson&#x27;s second inauguration, every U.S. president except Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump during their respective second inaugurations, (1985 and 2025) have paraded down Pennsylvania Avenue after taking the oath of office. Reagan and Trump both paraded up the avenue for their respective first inaugurations (January 1981 and January 2017) but not following their respective second inaugurations (1985 because freezing temperatures and high winds made it dangerous and 2025 because of polar vortex, extreme cold, and high winds).

====Presidential funeral processions====

From William Henry Harrison to Jimmy Carter, the funeral corteges of seven of the eight presidents who died in office and three former presidents followed this route. Franklin Roosevelt was the only president who died in office whose cortege did not follow this route.

Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s funeral cortege solemnly proceeded along Pennsylvania Avenue in 1865; only weeks later, the end of the American Civil War was celebrated with the Grand Review of the Armies when the Army of the Potomac paraded more joyously along the avenue. The funeral processions of Lyndon B. Johnson, Ford, and Carter proceeded down Pennsylvania Avenue. For Lyndon Johnson, the cortege was along Pennsylvania Avenue from U.S. Capitol to National City Christian Church, where he often worshiped and where his funeral was held. Ford&#x27;s funeral went up Pennsylvania Avenue, pausing at the White House en route to Washington National Cathedral, where his funeral was held. Carter&#x27;s funeral procession went down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol, with a casket transfer stop the United States Navy Memorial.

====Protests and celebrations====

In addition to serving as a location for official functions, Pennsylvania Avenue is a traditional parade and protest route of ordinary citizens. During the depression of the 1890s, Jacob Coxey marched 500 supporters down Pennsylvania Avenue to the U.S. Capitol to demand federal aid for the unemployed. Similarly, on the eve of Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s 1913 inauguration, Alice Paul masterminded a parade, the Woman Suffrage Procession, highlighting the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. In July 1932, a contingent of the Bonus Expeditionary Force carried flags up Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House, where they formed picket lines.

Pennsylvania Avenue also has served as a background for more lighthearted celebrations, including a series of Shriner&#x27;s parades in the 1920s and 1930s. Thomas and Concepcion Picciotto are the founders of the White House Peace Vigil, the longest-running anti-nuclear peace vigil in the nation at Lafayette Square on the 1600 block of Pennsylvania Avenue.

===Security measures===
After the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, the Secret Service closed the portion of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House to all vehicular traffic. Pedestrian and bicycle traffic, however, was still permitted on the sidewalk. After the September 11 attacks, all traffic in front of the White House was prohibited, and traffic near the White House is redirected to H Street or Constitution Avenue, both of which eventually link back with Pennsylvania Avenue.

In 2002, the National Capital Planning Commission invited several prominent landscape architects to submit proposals for the redesign of Pennsylvania Avenue at the White House, with the intention that the security measures would be woven into an overall plan for the precinct and a more welcoming public space might be created. The winning entry by a firm run by Michael Van Valkenburgh proposed a very simple approach to planting, paving, and the integration of required security steps. Construction was completed in 2004.

<text>Telex was a Belgian synth-pop group formed in 1978 by Marc Moulin, Dan Lacksman and Michel Moers, with the intention of &quot;making something really European, different from rock, without guitar‚Äîand the idea was electronic music&quot;.

==History==
In 1979, mixing the aesthetics of disco, punk and experimental electronic music, they released a stripped-down synthesized cover version of &quot;Twist √† St. Tropez&quot; by Les Chats Sauvages. They followed up with an ultra-slow cover of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;, a relaxed and dispassionate version of Plastic Bertrand&#x27;s punk song &quot;√áa Plane Pour Moi&quot;, and a mechanical cover of &quot;Dance to the Music&quot;, originally by Sly Stone. Telex built its music entirely from electronic instruments, employing joyously irreverent humor. The group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Looking for Saint Tropez&quot;, featured the worldwide hit single &quot;Moskow Diskow&quot;.

In 1980, Telex&#x27;s manager asked the group to enter the Eurovision Song Contest. The group entered and were eventually sent to the finals, although they apparently hoped to come in last.

The group&#x27;s song &quot;Euro-Vision&quot; was a cheerful bleepy song with deliberately banal lyrics about the Eurovision Song Contest, which they competed with in 1980 and placed 17th of 19 with 14 points.

For their third album, &quot;Sex&quot;, Telex enlisted the US group Sparks to help write the lyrics. However, the band still refused to play live and preferred to remain anonymous‚Äîcommon practice in the techno music artists the group later inspired but, nevertheless, unusual in 1981. The fourth Telex album, &quot;Wonderful World&quot;, was barely distributed. In 1986, Atlantic Records signed Telex and released the album &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; in 1988. In 1989, Telex revisited their old tracks and remixed them to resemble house music and other genres then prevalent in electronic pop. The result was &quot;Les Rythmes Automatiques&quot;, released in 1989.
After a long hiatus, Telex returned in March 2006 with &quot;How Do You Dance&quot; on EMI Records. It contained five original compositions as well as five covers. The group&#x27;s last single was a cover of &quot;On the Road Again&quot;, originally by Canned Heat. They also produced remixes for other artists&#x27; single releases, including &quot;A Pain That I&#x27;m Used To&quot; by Depeche Mode and &quot;Minimal&quot; by the Pet Shop Boys.

Following the death of band member Marc Moulin in 2008, the surviving members of the band announced their retirement from making music with the band&#x27;s final release, a compilation album titled &quot;Ultimate&quot;.

<doc id="48542" wikidata="Q160499" url="?curid=48542" title="Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P√©rigord">
<text>Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-P√©rigord (; ; 2 February 1754 ‚Äì 17 May 1838), 1st Prince of Benevento, then Prince of Talleyrand, was a French secularized clergyman, statesman, and leading diplomat. After studying theology, he became Agent-General of the Clergy in 1780. In 1789, just before the French Revolution, he became Bishop of Autun. He worked at the highest levels of successive French governments, most commonly as foreign minister or in some other diplomatic capacity. His career spanned the regimes of Louis XVI, the years of the French Revolution, Napoleon, Louis XVIII, Charles X, and Louis Philippe I. Those Talleyrand served often distrusted him but, like Napoleon, found him extremely useful. The name &quot;Talleyrand&quot; has become a byword for crafty and cynical diplomacy.

He was Napoleon&#x27;s chief diplomat during the years when French military victories brought one European state after another under French hegemony. However, most of the time, Talleyrand worked for peace so as to consolidate France&#x27;s gains. He succeeded in obtaining peace with Austria through the 1801 Treaty of Lun√©ville and with Britain in the 1802 Treaty of Amiens. He could not prevent the renewal of war in 1803 but by 1805 he opposed his emperor&#x27;s renewed wars against Austria, Prussia, and Russia. He resigned as foreign minister in August 1807, but retained the trust of Napoleon. He conspired to undermine the emperor&#x27;s plans through secret dealings with Tsar Alexander I of Russia and the Austrian minister Klemens von Metternich. Talleyrand sought a negotiated secure peace so as to perpetuate the gains of the French Revolution. Napoleon rejected peace; when he fell in 1814, Talleyrand supported the Bourbon Restoration decided by the Allies. He played a major role at the Congress of Vienna in 1814‚Äì1815, where he negotiated a favorable for France and played a role in unwinding the Napoleonic Wars.

Talleyrand polarizes opinion. Some regard him as one of the most versatile, skilled and influential diplomats in European history, while some believe that he was a traitor, betraying in turn the ancien r√©gime, the French Revolution and Napoleon.

==Early life==
Talleyrand was born in Paris into an aristocratic family which, though ancient and illustrious, was not particularly prosperous. His father, Count Charles Daniel de Talleyrand-P√©rigord, was 20 years of age when Charles was born. His mother was Alexandrine de Damas d&#x27;Antigny. Both his parents held positions at court, but as the youngest children of their respective families, had no important income. Talleyrand&#x27;s father had a long career in the French Royal Army, reaching the rank of lieutenant general, as did his uncle, Gabriel Marie de P√©rigord, despite having the same infirmity from which Talleyrand would suffer throughout his life. His father served all through the Seven Years&#x27; War.

From childhood, Talleyrand walked with a limp, which caused him to later be called &quot;&quot; (French for &quot;the lame devil&quot;) among other nicknames. In his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, he linked this infirmity to an accident at age four, but recent research has shown that his limp was in fact congenital. It might have been a congenital clubfoot. In any case, his handicap made him unable to follow his father into a military career, leaving the obvious career of the Church.

The latter held out the hope for Charles-Maurice of succeeding his uncle, Alexandre Ang√©lique de Talleyrand-P√©rigord, then Archbishop of Reims, one of the most prestigious and richest dioceses in France. At eight years old, Talleyrand attended the Coll√®ge d&#x27;Harcourt, the seminary of Saint-Sulpice, while studying theology at the Sorbonne until the age of 21. In his free time, he read the works of Montesquieu, Voltaire, and other writers who were beginning to question the authority of the ancien r√©gime in matters of church and state. As subdeacon he witnessed the coronation of Louis XVI at Reims in 1775.

He was not ordained a Catholic priest until four years later, on 19 December 1779, at the age of 25. Very soon, in 1780, he attained the influential position of Agent-General of the Clergy, and was instrumental in promoting the drawing up of a general inventory of Church properties in France as of 1785, along with a defense of &quot;inalienable rights of the Church&quot;, the latter being a stance he later denied. In 1788, the influence of Talleyrand&#x27;s father and family overcame the King&#x27;s dislike and obtained his appointment as Bishop of Autun, with a stipend of 22,000 livres. He was consecrated a bishop on 4 January 1789 by Louis-Andr√© de Grimaldi. The undoubtedly able Talleyrand, though hardly devout and even free-thinking in the Enlightenment mold, was outwardly respectful of religious observance. In the course of the Revolution, however, he was to manifest his cynicism and abandon all orthodox Catholic practice. He resigned his bishopric on 13 April 1791. On 29 June 1802, Pope Pius VII laicized Talleyrand, an event most uncommon at the time in the history of the Church.

==French Revolution==
Shortly after he was consecrated as Bishop of Autun, Talleyrand attended the Estates-General of 1789, representing the clergy, the First Estate. During the French Revolution, Talleyrand strongly supported the anti-clericalism of the revolutionaries. Along with Mirabeau, he promoted the appropriation of Church properties. He participated in the writing of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and proposed both the Decree on the goods of the clergy placed at the disposal of the Nation in 1789 and the Civil Constitution of the Clergy that nationalized the Church in preference to allegiance to the Pope. He also swore in the first four constitutional bishops, even though he had himself resigned as Bishop following his excommunication by Pope Pius VI in 1791. During the &quot;F√™te de la F√©d√©ration&quot; on 14 July 1790, Talleyrand celebrated Mass. Notably, he promoted public education in full spirit of the Enlightenment by preparing a 216-page Report on Public Instruction. It proposed pyramidical structure rising through local, district, and departmental schools, and parts were later adopted. During his 5-month tenure in the Estates-General, Talleyrand was also involved in drawing up the police regulations of Paris, proposed the suffrage of Jews, supported a ban on the tithes, and invented a method to ensure loans. Few bishops followed him in obedience to the new decree, and much of the French clergy came to view him as schismatic.

Just before his resignation from the bishopric, Talleyrand had been elected, with Mirabeau and the Abb√© Siey√®s, a member of the department of Paris. In that capacity he did useful work for some eighteen months in seeking to support the cause of order in the turbulent capital. Though he was often on strained terms with Mirabeau, his views generally coincided with those of that statesman, who before he died is said to have advised Talleyrand to develop a close understanding with England.

In 1792, Talleyrand was sent twice, unofficially, to London to avert war, and he was cordially received by Pitt and Grenville. After his first visit, he persuaded the then foreign minister, Charles Fran√ßois Dumouriez, of the importance of having a fully accredited ambassador in London, and the marquis de Chauvelin was duly appointed, with Talleyrand as his deputy. Still, after an initial British declaration of neutrality during the first campaigns of 1792, his mission ultimately failed. In September 1792, just at the beginning of the September massacres, he left Paris for England, having acquired a passport from Danton personally.

The National Convention issued a warrant for Talleyrand&#x27;s arrest in December 1792. In March 1794, with the two countries at the brink of war, he was forced to leave Britain by Pitt&#x27;s expulsion order. He then went to the neutral country of the United States. The ship he took to the US was forced by rough weather in the Channel to stop at Falmouth where Talleyrand recounts an awkward chance meeting with Benedict Arnold at an inn. During Talleyrand&#x27;s stay in the US, he supported himself by working as a bank agent, involved in commodity trading and real estate speculation. He was a house guest of Aaron Burr of New York and collaborated with Theophile Cazenove in Philadelphia. On 19 May 1794, Matthew Clarkson, the mayor of Philadelphia, received his oath. Talleyrand swore &quot;that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to...the United States of America... &quot; Burr later sought similar refuge in Talleyrand&#x27;s home during his self-imposed European exile (1808‚Äì12). However, Talleyrand would refuse to return the favor because Burr had killed Talleyrand&#x27;s friend Alexander Hamilton in an 1804 duel.

Talleyrand returned to France in 1796. After 9 Thermidor, he mobilized his friends (most notably the abb√© Martial Borye Desrenaudes and Germaine de Sta√´l) to lobby in the National Convention and the newly established Directoire for his return. His name was suppressed from the &quot;√©migr√©&quot; list and he returned to France on 25 September 1796. After gaining attention by giving addresses on the value of commercial relations with England, and of colonization as a way of renewing the nation, he became Foreign Minister in July 1797. He was behind the demand for bribes in the XYZ Affair which escalated into the Quasi-War, an undeclared naval war with the United States, 1798‚Äì1800. Talleyrand saw a possible political career for Napoleon during the Italian campaigns of 1796 to 1797. He wrote many letters to Napoleon, and the two became close allies. Talleyrand was against the destruction of the Republic of Venice, but he complimented Napoleon when the Treaty of Campo Formio with Austria was concluded (Venice was given to Austria), probably because he wanted to reinforce his alliance with Napoleon. Later in 1797, Talleyrand was instrumental in assisting with the Coup of 18 Fructidor, which ousted two moderate members of the Directory in favor of the Jacobins headed by Paul Barras.

==Under Napoleon==

Talleyrand, along with Napoleon&#x27;s younger brother, Lucien Bonaparte, was instrumental in the 1799 &quot;coup d&#x27;√©tat&quot; of 18 Brumaire, establishing the French Consulate government, although he also made preparations for flight if necessary. He also persuaded Barras to resign as Director. Talleyrand was soon made Foreign Minister by Napoleon, although he rarely agreed with Napoleon&#x27;s foreign policy. Domestically, Talleyrand used his influence to help in the repeal of the strict laws against √©migr√©s, refractory clergy, and the royalists of the west.

The Pope released him from the ban of excommunication in the Concordat of 1801, which also revoked the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Talleyrand was instrumental in the completion of the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. He wanted Napoleon to keep peace afterwards, as he thought France had reached its maximum expansion. Talleyrand was an integral player in the German mediatization. While the Treaty of Campo Formio of 1797 had, on paper, stripped German princes of their lands beyond the left bank of the Rhine, it was not enforced until the Treaty of Lun√©ville in 1801. As the French annexed these lands, leaders believed that rulers of states such as Baden, Bavaria, W√ºrttemberg, Prussia, Hesse and Nassau, who lost territories on the Left Bank, should receive new territories on the Right Bank through the secularization of ecclesiastical principalities. Many of these rulers gave out bribes in order to secure new lands, and Talleyrand and some of his associates amassed about 10 million francs in the process. This was the first blow in the destruction of the Holy Roman Empire.

While helping to establish French supremacy in neighboring states and assisting Bonaparte in securing the title of &quot;First Consul&quot; for life, Talleyrand sought all means of securing the permanent welfare of France. He worked hard to prevent the rupture of the peace of Amiens which occurred in May 1803, and he did what he could to prevent the Louisiana Purchase earlier in the year. These events, as he saw, told against the best interests of France and endangered the gains which she had secured by war and diplomacy. Thereafter he strove to moderate Napoleon&#x27;s ambition and to preserve the European system as far as possible.

Napoleon forced Talleyrand into marriage in September 1802 to longtime mistress Catherine Grand (n√©e Worl√©e). Talleyrand purchased the Ch√¢teau de Valen√ßay in May 1803, upon the urging of Napoleon. This later was used as the site of imprisonment of the Spanish royal family in 1808‚Äì1813, after Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Spain. In May 1804, Napoleon bestowed upon Talleyrand the title of Grand Chamberlain of the Empire, with almost 500,000 francs a year. In 1806, he was made Sovereign Prince of Benevento (or B√©n√©vent), a former Papal fief in southern Italy. Talleyrand held the title until 1815 and administered the principality concurrently with his other tasks.

Talleyrand was opposed to the harsh treatment of Austria in the 1805 Treaty of Pressburg and of Prussia in the Peace of Tilsit in 1807. In 1806, after Pressburg, he profited greatly from the reorganization of the German lands, this time into the Confederation of the Rhine. He negotiated the Treaty of Posen with Saxony, but was shut out completely from the negotiations at Tilsit. After Queen Louise of Prussia failed in her appeal to Napoleon to spare her nation, she wept and was consoled by Talleyrand. This gave him a good name among the elites of European nations outside France.

==Changing sides==
Having wearied of serving a master in whom he no longer had much confidence, Talleyrand resigned as minister of foreign affairs in 1807, although the Emperor retained him in the Council of State as Vice-Grand Elector of the Empire. He disapproved of Napoleon&#x27;s Spanish initiative, which resulted in the Peninsular War beginning in 1808. At the Congress of Erfurt in September‚ÄìOctober 1808, Talleyrand secretly counseled Tsar Alexander. The Tsar&#x27;s attitude towards Napoleon was one of apprehensive opposition. Talleyrand repaired the confidence of the Russian monarch, who rebuked Napoleon&#x27;s attempts to form a direct anti-Austrian military alliance. Napoleon had expected Talleyrand to help convince the Tsar to accept his proposals and never discovered that Talleyrand was working at cross-purposes. Talleyrand believed Napoleon would eventually destroy the empire he had worked to build across multiple rulers.

After his resignation in 1807 from the ministry, Talleyrand began to accept bribes from hostile powers (mainly Austria, but also Russia), to betray Napoleon&#x27;s secrets. Talleyrand and Joseph Fouch√©, who were typically enemies in both politics and the salons, had a rapprochement in late 1808 and entered into discussions over the imperial line of succession. Napoleon had yet to address this matter and the two men knew that without a legitimate heir a struggle for power would erupt in the wake of Napoleon&#x27;s death. Even Talleyrand, who believed that Napoleon&#x27;s policies were leading France to ruin, understood the necessity of peaceful transitions of power. Napoleon received word of their actions and deemed them treasonous. This perception caused the famous dressing down of Talleyrand in front of Napoleon&#x27;s marshals, during which Napoleon famously claimed that he could &quot;break him like a glass, but it&#x27;s not worth the trouble&quot; and added with a scatological tone that Talleyrand was &quot;shit in a silk stocking&quot;, to which the minister coldly retorted, once Napoleon had left, &quot;Pity that so great a man should have been so badly brought up!&quot;

Talleyrand opposed the further harsh treatment of Austria in 1809 after the War of the Fifth Coalition. He was also a critic of the French invasion of Russia in 1812. He was invited to resume his former office in late 1813, but Talleyrand could see that power was slipping from Napoleon&#x27;s hands. He offered to resign from the council in early 1814, but Napoleon refused the move. Talleyrand then hosted the tsar at the end of March after the fall of Paris, persuaded him that the best chance of stability lay with the House of Bourbon, and gained his support. On 1 April 1814, he led the S√©nat conservateur in establishing a provisional government in Paris, of which he was elected president. On 2 April the Senate officially deposed Napoleon with the Acte de d√©ch√©ance de l&#x27;Empereur; by 11 April, it had approved the Treaty of Fontainebleau and adopted a new constitution to re-establish the Bourbon monarchy.

==Bourbon Restoration and July Monarchy==


When Napoleon was succeeded by Louis XVIII in April 1814, Talleyrand was one of the key agents of the restoration of the House of Bourbon, although he opposed the new legislation of Louis&#x27;s rule. Talleyrand was the chief French negotiator at the Congress of Vienna; earlier that same year he signed the Treaty of Paris. It was due in part to his skills that the terms of the treaty were remarkably lenient towards France. As the Congress opened, the right to make decisions was restricted to four countries: Austria, the United Kingdom, Prussia and Russia. France and other European countries were invited to attend, but were not allowed to influence the process. Talleyrand promptly became the champion of the small countries and demanded admission into the ranks of the decision-making process. The four powers admitted France and Spain to the decision-making backrooms of the conference after a good deal of diplomatic maneuvering by Talleyrand, who had the support of the Spanish representative, Pedro G√≥mez Labrador, Marquis of Labrador. Spain was excluded after a while (a result of both the Marquis of Labrador&#x27;s incompetence as well as the quixotic nature of Spain&#x27;s agenda), but France (Talleyrand) was allowed to participate until the end. Russia and Prussia sought to enlarge their territory at the Congress. Russia demanded annexation of Poland (already occupied by Russian troops); this demand was finally satisfied, despite protests by France, Austria and the United Kingdom. Austria was afraid of future conflicts with Russia or Prussia and the United Kingdom was opposed to their expansion as well‚Äîand Talleyrand managed to take advantage of these contradictions within the former anti-French coalition. On 3 January 1815, a secret treaty was signed by France&#x27;s Talleyrand, Austria&#x27;s Metternich and Britain&#x27;s Castlereagh. By this tract, officially a secret treaty of defensive alliance, the three powers agreed to use force if necessary to &quot;repulse aggression&quot; (of Russia and Prussia) and to protect the &quot;state of security and independence&quot;.

Talleyrand, having managed to establish a middle position, received some favors from the other countries in exchange for his support: France returned to its 1792 boundaries without reparations, with French control over the papal Comtat Venaissin, County of Montb√©liard, and Salm, which had been independent at the start of the French Revolution in 1789. It would later be debated which outcome would have been better for France: allowing Prussia to annex all of Saxony (Talleyrand ensured that only part of the kingdom would be annexed) or the Rhine provinces. The first option would have kept Prussia farther away from France, but would have needed much more opposition as well. Some historians have argued that Talleyrand&#x27;s diplomacy wound up establishing the fault lines of World War I, especially as it allowed Prussia to engulf small German states west of the Rhine. This simultaneously placed the Prussian Army at the French-German frontier, for the first time; made Prussia the largest German power in terms of territory, population and the industry of the Ruhr and Rhineland; and eventually helped pave the way to German unification under the Prussian throne. However, at the time Talleyrand&#x27;s diplomacy was regarded as successful, as it removed the threat of France being partitioned by the victors. Talleyrand also managed to strengthen his own position in France (ultraroyalists had disapproved of the presence of a former &quot;revolutionary&quot; and &quot;murderer of the Duke d&#x27;Enghien&quot; in the royal cabinet).

Napoleon&#x27;s return to France in 1815 and his subsequent defeat, the Hundred Days, was a reverse for the diplomatic victories of Talleyrand (who remained in Vienna the whole time). The second peace settlement was markedly less lenient and it was fortunate for France that the business of the Congress had been concluded. Having been appointed foreign minister and president of the council on 9 July 1815, Talleyrand resigned in September of that year, over his objections to the second treaty. Louis XVIII appointed him as the Grand Chamberlain of France, a mostly ceremonial role which provided Talleyrand with a steady income. For the next fifteen years he restricted himself to the role of &quot;elder statesman&quot;, criticizing and intriguing against Minister of Police √âlie, duc Decazes, Prime Minister Duc de Richelieu and other political opponents from the sidelines. In celebration of the birth of the Duc de Bordeaux, Louis XVIII made Talleyrand a knight of the Order of the Holy Spirit.

In December 1829, Talleyrand funded the foundation of the &quot;National&quot; newspaper. The newspaper was run by his personal friend Adolphe Thiers, alongside Armand Carrel, Fran√ßois Mignet and Stendhal. Its first issue appeared on 3 January 1830, quickly becoming the mouthpiece of the Orl√©anist cause and gaining popularity among the French liberal bourgeoisie. Following the ascent of Louis-Philippe I to the throne in the aftermath of the July Revolution of 1830, Talleyrand reluctantly agreed to become ambassador to the United Kingdom, a post he held from 1830 to 1834. In this role, he strove to reinforce the legitimacy of Louis-Philippe&#x27;s regime. He played a vital role in the London Conference of 1830, rebuking a partition plan developed by his son Charles de Flahaut and helping bring Leopold of Saxe-Coburg to the throne of the newly independent Kingdom of Belgium. In April 1834 he crowned his diplomatic career by signing the treaty which brought together as allies France, Great Britain, Spain, and Portugal.

After resigning from his position as ambassador in London in November 1834, Talleyrand stopped playing an active role in French politics. He split his time between Ch√¢teau de Valen√ßay and Saint-Florentin, where he hosted frequent banquets and played whist with his visitors. His physical health began to steadily deteriorate and he began using an armchair on wheels provided to him by Louis Philippe I. He spent most of his time in the company of the Duchess Dino and concerned himself with the education of her daughter Pauline. Talleyrand suffered from bouts of recurring depression which were caused by his concern over his legacy and the development of the Napoleonic myth. To that end he ordered that his autobiography, the &quot;Memoirs&quot;, be published 30 years after his death. He also sought to gain the friendship of people he believed would shape public opinion in the future, including Honor√© de Balzac, Lady Granville and Alphonse de Lamartine. During the last years of his life Talleyrand began planning his reconciliation with the Catholic Church. On 16 May 1838, he signed a retraction of his errors towards the church and a letter of submission to Pope Gregory XVI. He died the following day at 3:55¬†p.m., at Saint-Florentin.

By a codicil added to his will on 17 March 1838, Talleyrand left his memoirs and papers to the duchess of Dino and Adolphe de Bacourt. The latter revised them with care, and added to them other pieces emanating from Talleyrand. They fell into some question: first that Talleyrand is known to have destroyed many of his most important papers, and secondly that de Bacourt almost certainly drew up the connected narrative which we now possess from notes which were in more or less of confusion. The were later edited by the duc de Broglie and published in 1891.

==Private life==
Talleyrand had a reputation for promiscuity and as a . He left no legitimate children, though he possibly fathered over two dozen illegitimate ones. Four possible children of his have been identified: Charles Joseph, comte de Flahaut, generally accepted to be an illegitimate son of Talleyrand; the painter Eug√®ne Delacroix, once rumoured to be Talleyrand&#x27;s son, though this is doubted by historians who have examined the issue (for example, L√©on No√´l, French ambassador); the &quot;Mysterious Charlotte&quot;, possibly his daughter by his future wife, Catherine Worl√©e Grand; and Pauline, ostensibly the daughter of the Duke and Duchess Dino. Of these four, only the first is given credence by historians. However, the French historian Emmanuel de Waresquiel has lately given much credibility to father-daughter link between Talleyrand and Pauline whom he referred to as &quot;my dear Minette&quot;. Thaddeus Stevens &quot;suffered too from the rumor that he was actually the bastard son of Count Talleyrand, who was said to have visited New England in the year before Stevens&#x27; birth. ... Actually Talleyrand did not visit New England till 1794, when Stevens was already two years old.&quot;

Aristocratic women were a key component of Talleyrand&#x27;s political tactics, both for their influence and their ability to cross borders unhindered. His presumed lover Germaine de Sta√´l was a major influence on him, and he on her. Though their personal philosophies were most different (she a romantic, he very much unsentimental), she assisted him greatly, most notably by lobbying Barras to permit Talleyrand to return to France from his American exile, and then to have him made foreign minister. He lived with Catherine Worl√©e, born in India and married there to Charles Grand. She had traveled about before settling in Paris in the 1780s, where she lived as a notorious courtesan for several years before divorcing Grand to marry Talleyrand. Talleyrand was in no hurry to marry, and it was after repeated postponements that Napoleon obliged him in 1802 to formalize the relationship or risk his political career. While serving as a high level negotiator at the Congress of Vienna (1814‚Äì1815), Talleyrand entered into an arrangement with Dorothea von Biron, the wife of his nephew, the Duke of Dino. Shortly after, he separated from Catherine.

Talleyrand&#x27;s venality was notorious; in the tradition of the &quot;ancien r√©gime&quot;, he expected to be paid for the state duties he performed‚Äîwhether these can properly be called &quot;bribes&quot; is open to debate. For example, during the German mediatization, the consolidation of the small German states, a number of German rulers and elites paid him to save their possessions or enlarge their territories. Less successfully, he solicited payments from the United States government to open negotiations, precipitating a diplomatic disaster (the &quot;XYZ Affair&quot;). The difference between his diplomatic success in Europe and failure with the United States illustrates that his diplomacy rested firmly on the power of the French army that was a terrible threat to the German states within reach, but lacked the logistics to threaten the US not the least because of the British naval domination of the seas. After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, he withdrew claims to the title &quot;Prince of Benevento&quot;, but was created Duke of Talleyrand with the style &quot;Prince de Talleyrand&quot; for life, in the same manner as his estranged wife.

Described by biographer Philip Ziegler as a &quot;pattern of subtlety and finesse&quot; and a &quot;creature of grandeur and guile&quot;, Talleyrand was a great conversationalist, gourmet, and wine connoisseur. He was a frequent visitor at the &quot;salon&quot; hosted by Ad√®le de Bellegarde and her sister Aurore, with whom he dined regularly over a period of five years. From 1801 to 1804, he owned Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion in Bordeaux. In 1803, Napoleon ordered Talleyrand to acquire the Ch√¢teau de Valen√ßay as a place particularly appropriate for reception of foreign dignitaries, and Talleyrand made it his primary place of residence until his death in 1838. There he employed the renowned French chef Marie-Antoine Car√™me, one of the first celebrity chefs known as the &quot;chef of kings and king of chefs&quot;, and was said to have spent an hour every day with him. His Paris residence on the Place de la Concorde, acquired in 1812 and sold to James Mayer de Rothschild in 1838, is now owned by the Embassy of the United States. Talleyrand has been regarded as a traitor because of his support for successive regimes, some of which were mutually hostile. According to French philosopher Simone Weil, criticism of his loyalty is unfounded, as Talleyrand served not every regime as had been said, but in reality &quot;France behind every regime&quot;.

Near the end of his life, Talleyrand became interested in Catholicism again while teaching his young granddaughter simple prayers. The Abb√© F√©lix Dupanloup came to Talleyrand in his last hours, and according to his account Talleyrand made confession and received extreme unction. When the abb√© tried to anoint Talleyrand&#x27;s palms, as prescribed by the rite, he turned his hands over to make the priest anoint him on the back of the hands, since he was a bishop. He also signed, in the abb√©&#x27;s presence, a solemn declaration in which he openly disavowed &quot;the great errors which ‚Ä¶ had troubled and afflicted the Catholic, Apostolic and Roman Church, and in which he himself had had the misfortune to fall.&quot; He died on 17 May 1838 and was buried in the Notre-Dame Chapel, near his Ch√¢teau de Valen√ßay. Today, when speaking of the art of diplomacy, the phrase &quot;they are a Talleyrand&quot; is variously used to describe a statesman of great resourcefulness and craft, or a cynical and conscienceless self-serving politician.

<doc id="48548" wikidata="Q170304" url="?curid=48548" title="Dopamine">
<text>Dopamine (DA, a contraction of 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine) is a neuromodulatory molecule that plays several important roles in cells. It is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families. Dopamine constitutes about 80% of the catecholamine content in the brain. It is an amine synthesized by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of its precursor chemical, L-DOPA, which is synthesized in the brain and kidneys. Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals. In the brain, dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter‚Äîa chemical released by neurons (nerve cells) to send signals to other nerve cells. Neurotransmitters are synthesized in specific regions of the brain but affect many regions systemically. The brain includes several distinct dopamine pathways, one of which plays a major role in the motivational component of reward-motivated behavior. The anticipation of most types of rewards increases the level of dopamine in the brain, and many addictive drugs increase dopamine release or block its reuptake into neurons following release. Other brain dopamine pathways are involved in motor control and in controlling the release of various hormones. These pathways and cell groups form a dopamine system which is neuromodulatory.

In popular culture and media, dopamine is often portrayed as the main chemical of pleasure, but the current opinion in pharmacology is that dopamine instead confers motivational salience; in other words, dopamine signals the perceived motivational prominence (i.e., the desirability or aversiveness) of an outcome, which in turn propels the organism&#x27;s behavior toward or away from achieving that outcome.

Outside the central nervous system, dopamine functions primarily as a local paracrine messenger. In blood vessels, it inhibits norepinephrine release and acts as a vasodilator; in the kidneys, it increases sodium excretion and urine output; in the pancreas, it reduces insulin production; in the digestive system, it reduces gastrointestinal motility and protects intestinal mucosa; and in the immune system, it reduces the activity of lymphocytes. With the exception of the blood vessels, dopamine in each of these peripheral systems is synthesized locally and exerts its effects near the cells that release it.

Several important diseases of the nervous system are associated with dysfunctions of the dopamine system, and some of the key medications used to treat them work by altering the effects of dopamine. Parkinson&#x27;s disease, a degenerative condition causing tremor and motor impairment, is caused by a loss of dopamine-secreting neurons in an area of the midbrain called the substantia nigra. Its metabolic precursor L-DOPA can be manufactured; &quot;Levodopa&quot;, a pure form of L-DOPA, is the most widely used treatment for Parkinson&#x27;s. There is evidence that schizophrenia involves altered levels of dopamine activity, and most antipsychotic drugs used to treat this are dopamine antagonists which reduce dopamine activity. Similar dopamine antagonist drugs are also some of the most effective anti-nausea agents. Restless legs syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are associated with decreased dopamine activity. Dopaminergic stimulants can be addictive in high doses, but some are used at lower doses to treat ADHD. Dopamine itself is available as a manufactured medication for intravenous injection. It is useful in the treatment of severe heart failure or cardiogenic shock. In newborn babies it may be used for hypotension and septic shock.
==Structure==
A dopamine molecule consists of a catechol structure (a benzene ring with two hydroxyl side groups) with one amine group attached via an ethyl chain. As such, dopamine is the simplest possible catecholamine, a family that also includes the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and epinephrine. The presence of a benzene ring with this amine attachment makes it a substituted phenethylamine, a family that includes numerous psychoactive drugs.

Like most amines, dopamine is an organic base. As a base, it is generally protonated in acidic environments (in an acid-base reaction). The protonated form is highly water-soluble and relatively stable, but can become oxidized if exposed to oxygen or other oxidants. In basic environments, dopamine is not protonated. In this free base form, it is less water-soluble and also more highly reactive. Because of the increased stability and water-solubility of the protonated form, dopamine is supplied for chemical or pharmaceutical use as dopamine hydrochloride‚Äîthat is, the hydrochloride salt that is created when dopamine is combined with hydrochloric acid. In dry form, dopamine hydrochloride is a fine powder which is white to yellow in color.
==Biochemistry==
===Synthesis===
Dopamine is synthesized in a restricted set of cell types, mainly neurons and cells in the medulla of the adrenal glands. The primary and minor metabolic pathways respectively are:

:Primary: -Phenylalanine ‚Üí -Tyrosine ‚Üí -DOPA ‚Üí Dopamine
:Minor: -Phenylalanine ‚Üí -Tyrosine ‚Üí &quot;p&quot;-Tyramine ‚Üí Dopamine
:Minor: -Phenylalanine ‚Üí &quot;m&quot;-Tyrosine ‚Üí &quot;m&quot;-Tyramine ‚Üí Dopamine

The direct precursor of dopamine, -DOPA, can be synthesized indirectly from the essential amino acid phenylalanine or directly from the non-essential amino acid tyrosine. These amino acids are found in nearly every protein and so are readily available in food, with tyrosine being the most common. Although dopamine is also found in many types of food, it is incapable of crossing the blood‚Äìbrain barrier that surrounds and protects the brain. It must therefore be synthesized inside the brain to perform its neuronal activity.

-Phenylalanine is converted into -tyrosine by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, with molecular oxygen (O2) and tetrahydrobiopterin as cofactors. -Tyrosine is converted into -DOPA by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, with tetrahydrobiopterin, O2, and iron (Fe2+) as cofactors. -DOPA is converted into dopamine by the enzyme aromatic -amino acid decarboxylase (also known as DOPA decarboxylase), with pyridoxal phosphate as the cofactor.

Dopamine itself is used as precursor in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and epinephrine. Dopamine is converted into norepinephrine by the enzyme dopamine Œ≤-hydroxylase, with O2 and -ascorbic acid as cofactors. Norepinephrine is converted into epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine &quot;N&quot;-methyltransferase with &quot;S&quot;-adenosyl--methionine as the cofactor.

Some of the cofactors also require their own synthesis. Deficiency in any required amino acid or cofactor can impair the synthesis of dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.

===Degradation===
Dopamine is broken down into inactive metabolites by a set of enzymes‚Äîmonoamine oxidase (MAO), catechol-&quot;O&quot;-methyl transferase (COMT), and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), acting in sequence. Both isoforms of monoamine oxidase, MAO-A and MAO-B, effectively metabolize dopamine. Different breakdown pathways exist but the main end-product is homovanillic acid (HVA), which has no known biological activity. From the bloodstream, homovanillic acid is filtered out by the kidneys and then excreted in the urine. The two primary metabolic routes that convert dopamine into HVA are:
* Dopamine ‚Üí DOPAL ‚Üí DOPAC ‚Üí HVA¬†‚Äì catalyzed by MAO, ALDH, and COMT respectively
* Dopamine ‚Üí 3-Methoxytyramine ‚Üí HVA¬†‚Äì catalyzed by COMT and MAO+ALDH respectively

In clinical research on schizophrenia, measurements of homovanillic acid in plasma have been used to estimate levels of dopamine activity in the brain. A difficulty in this approach however, is separating the high level of plasma homovanillic acid contributed by the metabolism of norepinephrine.

Although dopamine is normally broken down by an oxidoreductase enzyme, it is also susceptible to oxidation by direct reaction with oxygen, yielding quinones plus various free radicals as products. The rate of oxidation can be increased by the presence of ferric iron or other factors. Quinones and free radicals produced by autoxidation of dopamine can poison cells, and there is evidence that this mechanism may contribute to the cell loss that occurs in Parkinson&#x27;s disease and other conditions.

==Functions==
===Cellular effects===

Dopamine exerts its effects by binding to and activating cell surface receptors. In humans, dopamine has a high binding affinity at dopamine receptors and human trace amine-associated receptor 1 (hTAAR1). In mammals, five subtypes of dopamine receptors have been identified, labeled from D1 to D5. All of them function as metabotropic, G protein-coupled receptors, meaning that they exert their effects via a complex second messenger system. These receptors can be divided into two families, known as D1-like and D2-like. For receptors located on neurons in the nervous system, the ultimate effect of D1-like activation (D1 and D5) can be excitation (via opening of sodium channels) or inhibition (via opening of potassium channels); the ultimate effect of D2-like activation (D2, D3, and D4) is usually inhibition of the target neuron. Consequently, it is incorrect to describe dopamine itself as either excitatory or inhibitory: its effect on a target neuron depends on which types of receptors are present on the membrane of that neuron and on the internal responses of that neuron to the second messenger cAMP. D1 receptors are the most numerous dopamine receptors in the human nervous system; D2 receptors are next; D3, D4, and D5 receptors are present at significantly lower levels.

====Storage, release, and reuptake====

Inside the brain, dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator, and is controlled by a set of mechanisms common to all monoamine neurotransmitters. After synthesis, dopamine is transported from the cytosol into secretory vesicles, including synaptic vesicles, small and large dense core vesicles by a solute carrier‚Äîa vesicular monoamine transporter, VMAT2. Dopamine is stored in these vesicles until it is ejected into the synaptic cleft. In most cases, the release of dopamine occurs through a process called exocytosis which is caused by action potentials, but it can also be caused by the activity of an intracellular trace amine-associated receptor, TAAR1. TAAR1 is a high-affinity receptor for dopamine, trace amines, and certain substituted amphetamines that is located along membranes in the intracellular milieu of the presynaptic cell; activation of the receptor can regulate dopamine signaling by inducing dopamine reuptake inhibition and efflux as well as by inhibiting neuronal firing through a diverse set of mechanisms.

Once in the synapse, dopamine binds to and activates dopamine receptors. These can be postsynaptic dopamine receptors, which are located on dendrites (the postsynaptic neuron), or presynaptic autoreceptors (e.g., the D2sh and presynaptic D3 receptors), which are located on the membrane of an axon terminal (the presynaptic neuron). After the postsynaptic neuron elicits an action potential, dopamine molecules quickly become unbound from their receptors. They are then absorbed back into the presynaptic cell, via reuptake mediated either by the dopamine transporter or by the plasma membrane monoamine transporter. Once back in the cytosol, dopamine can either be broken down by a monoamine oxidase or repackaged into vesicles by VMAT2, making it available for future release.

In the brain the level of extracellular dopamine is modulated by two mechanisms: phasic and tonic transmission. Phasic dopamine release, like most neurotransmitter release in the nervous system, is driven directly by action potentials in the dopamine-containing cells. Tonic dopamine transmission occurs when small amounts of dopamine are released without being preceded by presynaptic action potentials. Tonic transmission is regulated by a variety of factors, including the activity of other neurons and neurotransmitter reuptake.

=== Central nervous system===


Inside the brain, dopamine plays important roles in executive functions, motor control, motivation, arousal, reinforcement, and reward, as well as lower-level functions including lactation, sexual gratification, and nausea. The dopaminergic cell groups and pathways make up the dopamine system which is neuromodulatory.

Dopaminergic neurons (dopamine-producing nerve cells) are comparatively few in number‚Äîa total of around 400,000 in the human brain‚Äîand their cell bodies are confined in groups to a few relatively small brain areas. However their axons project to many other brain areas, and they exert powerful effects on their targets. These dopaminergic cell groups were first mapped in 1964 by Annica Dahlstr√∂m and Kjell Fuxe, who assigned them labels starting with the letter &quot;A&quot; (for &quot;aminergic&quot;). In their scheme, areas A1 through A7 contain the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, whereas A8 through A14 contain dopamine. The dopaminergic areas they identified are the substantia nigra (groups 8 and 9); the ventral tegmental area (group 10); the posterior hypothalamus (group 11); the arcuate nucleus (group 12); the zona incerta (group 13) and the periventricular nucleus (group 14).

The substantia nigra is a small midbrain area that forms a component of the basal ganglia. This has two parts‚Äîan input area called the pars reticulata and an output area called the pars compacta. The dopaminergic neurons are found mainly in the pars compacta (cell group A8) and nearby (group A9). In humans, the projection of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra pars compacta to the dorsal striatum, termed the &quot;nigrostriatal pathway&quot;, plays a significant role in the control of motor function and in learning new motor skills. These neurons are especially vulnerable to damage, and when a large number of them die, the result is a parkinsonian syndrome.

The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is another midbrain area. The most prominent group of VTA dopaminergic neurons projects to the prefrontal cortex via the mesocortical pathway and another smaller group projects to the nucleus accumbens via the mesolimbic pathway. Together, these two pathways are collectively termed the &quot;mesocorticolimbic projection&quot;. The VTA also sends dopaminergic projections to the amygdala, cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. Mesocorticolimbic neurons play a central role in reward and other aspects of motivation. Accumulating literature shows that dopamine also plays a crucial role in aversive learning through its effects on a number of brain regions.

The posterior hypothalamus has dopamine neurons that project to the spinal cord, but their function is not well established. There is some evidence that pathology in this area plays a role in restless legs syndrome, a condition in which people have difficulty sleeping due to an overwhelming compulsion to constantly move parts of the body, especially the legs.

The arcuate nucleus and the periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus have dopamine neurons that form an important projection‚Äîthe &quot;tuberoinfundibular pathway&quot; which goes to the pituitary gland, where it influences the secretion of the hormone prolactin. Dopamine is the primary neuroendocrine inhibitor of the secretion of prolactin from the anterior pituitary gland. Dopamine produced by neurons in the arcuate nucleus is secreted into the hypophyseal portal system of the median eminence, which supplies the pituitary gland. The prolactin cells that produce prolactin, in the absence of dopamine, secrete prolactin continuously; dopamine inhibits this secretion.

The zona incerta, grouped between the arcuate and periventricular nuclei, projects to several areas of the hypothalamus, and participates in the control of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which is necessary to activate the development of the male and female reproductive systems, following puberty.

An additional group of dopamine-secreting neurons is found in the retina of the eye. These neurons are amacrine cells, meaning that they have no axons. They release dopamine into the extracellular medium, and are specifically active during daylight hours, becoming silent at night. This retinal dopamine acts to enhance the activity of cone cells in the retina while suppressing rod cells‚Äîthe result is to increase sensitivity to color and contrast during bright light conditions, at the cost of reduced sensitivity when the light is dim.

====Basal ganglia====
The largest and most important sources of dopamine in the vertebrate brain are the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. Both structures are components of the midbrain, closely related to each other and functionally similar in many respects. The largest component of the basal ganglia is the striatum. The substantia nigra sends a dopaminergic projection to the dorsal striatum, while the ventral tegmental area sends a similar type of dopaminergic projection to the ventral striatum.

Progress in understanding the functions of the basal ganglia has been slow. The most popular hypotheses, broadly stated, propose that the basal ganglia play a central role in action selection. The action selection theory in its simplest form proposes that when a person or animal is in a situation where several behaviors are possible, activity in the basal ganglia determines which of them is executed, by releasing that response from inhibition while continuing to inhibit other motor systems that if activated would generate competing behaviors. Thus the basal ganglia, in this concept, are responsible for initiating behaviors, but not for determining the details of how they are carried out. In other words, they essentially form a decision-making system.

The basal ganglia can be divided into several sectors, and each is involved in controlling particular types of actions. The ventral sector of the basal ganglia (containing the ventral striatum and ventral tegmental area) operates at the highest level of the hierarchy, selecting actions at the whole-organism level. The dorsal sectors (containing the dorsal striatum and substantia nigra) operate at lower levels, selecting the specific muscles and movements that are used to implement a given behavior pattern.

Dopamine contributes to the action selection process in at least two important ways. First, it sets the &quot;threshold&quot; for initiating actions. The higher the level of dopamine activity, the lower the impetus required to evoke a given behavior. As a consequence, high levels of dopamine lead to high levels of motor activity and impulsive behavior; low levels of dopamine lead to torpor and slowed reactions. Parkinson&#x27;s disease, in which dopamine levels in the substantia nigra circuit are greatly reduced, is characterized by stiffness and difficulty initiating movement‚Äîhowever, when people with the disease are confronted with strong stimuli such as a serious threat, their reactions can be as vigorous as those of a healthy person. In the opposite direction, drugs that increase dopamine release, such as cocaine or amphetamine, can produce heightened levels of activity, including, at the extreme, psychomotor agitation and stereotyped movements.

The second important effect of dopamine is as a &quot;teaching&quot; signal. When an action is followed by an increase in dopamine activity, the basal ganglia circuit is altered in a way that makes the same response easier to evoke when similar situations arise in the future. This is a form of operant conditioning, in which dopamine plays the role of a reward signal.

====Reward====

In the language used to discuss the reward system, &quot;reward&quot; is the attractive and motivational property of a stimulus that induces appetitive behavior (also known as approach behavior) and consummatory behavior. A rewarding stimulus is one that can induce the organism to approach it and choose to consume it. Pleasure, learning (e.g., classical and operant conditioning), and approach behavior are the three main functions of reward. As an aspect of reward, &quot;pleasure&quot; provides a definition of reward; however, while all pleasurable stimuli are rewarding, not all rewarding stimuli are pleasurable (e.g., extrinsic rewards like money). The motivational or desirable aspect of rewarding stimuli is reflected by the approach behavior that they induce, whereas the pleasure from intrinsic rewards results from consuming them after acquiring them. A neuropsychological model which distinguishes these two components of an intrinsically rewarding stimulus is the incentive salience model, where &quot;wanting&quot; or desire (less commonly, &quot;seeking&quot;) corresponds to appetitive or approach behavior while &quot;liking&quot; or pleasure corresponds to consummatory behavior. In human drug addicts, &quot;wanting&quot; becomes dissociated with &quot;liking&quot; as the desire to use an addictive drug increases, while the pleasure obtained from consuming it decreases due to drug tolerance.

Within the brain, dopamine functions partly as a global reward signal. An initial dopamine response to a rewarding stimulus encodes information about the salience, value, and context of a reward. In the context of reward-related learning, dopamine also functions as a &quot;reward prediction error&quot; signal, that is, the degree to which the value of a reward is unexpected. According to this hypothesis proposed by Montague, Dayan, and Sejnowski, rewards that are expected do not produce a second phasic dopamine response in certain dopaminergic cells, but rewards that are unexpected, or greater than expected, produce a short-lasting increase in synaptic dopamine, whereas the omission of an expected reward actually causes dopamine release to drop below its background level. The &quot;prediction error&quot; hypothesis has drawn particular interest from computational neuroscientists, because an influential computational-learning method known as temporal difference learning makes heavy use of a signal that encodes prediction error. This confluence of theory and data has led to a fertile interaction between neuroscientists and computer scientists interested in machine learning.

Evidence from microelectrode recordings from the brains of animals shows that dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra are strongly activated by a wide variety of rewarding events. These reward-responsive dopamine neurons in the VTA and substantia nigra are crucial for reward-related cognition and serve as the central component of the reward system. The function of dopamine varies in each axonal projection from the VTA and substantia nigra; for example, the VTA‚Äìnucleus accumbens shell projection assigns incentive salience (&quot;want&quot;) to rewarding stimuli and its associated cues, the VTA‚Äìprefrontal cortex projection updates the value of different goals in accordance with their incentive salience, the VTA‚Äìamygdala and VTA‚Äìhippocampus projections mediate the consolidation of reward-related memories, and both the VTA‚Äìnucleus accumbens core and substantia nigra‚Äìdorsal striatum pathways are involved in learning motor responses that facilitate the acquisition of rewarding stimuli. Some activity within the VTA dopaminergic projections appears to be associated with reward prediction as well.

====Pleasure====
While dopamine has a central role in causing &quot;wanting,&quot; associated with the appetitive or approach behavioral responses to rewarding stimuli, detailed studies have shown that dopamine cannot simply be equated with hedonic &quot;liking&quot; or pleasure, as reflected in the consummatory behavioral response. Dopamine neurotransmission is involved in some but not all aspects of pleasure-related cognition, since pleasure centers have been identified both within the dopamine system (i.e., nucleus accumbens shell) and outside the dopamine system (i.e., ventral pallidum and parabrachial nucleus). For example, direct electrical stimulation of dopamine pathways, using electrodes implanted in the brain, is experienced as pleasurable, and many types of animals are willing to work to obtain it. Antipsychotic drugs reduce dopamine levels and tend to cause anhedonia, a diminished ability to experience pleasure. Many types of pleasurable experiences‚Äîsuch as sexual intercourse, eating, and playing video games‚Äîincrease dopamine release. All addictive drugs directly or indirectly affect dopamine neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens; these drugs increase drug &quot;wanting&quot;, leading to compulsive drug use, when repeatedly taken in high doses, presumably through the sensitization of incentive-salience. Drugs that increase synaptic dopamine concentrations include psychostimulants such as methamphetamine and cocaine. These produce increases in &quot;wanting&quot; behaviors, but do not greatly alter expressions of pleasure or change levels of satiation. However, opiate drugs such as heroin and morphine produce increases in expressions of &quot;liking&quot; and &quot;wanting&quot; behaviors. Moreover, animals in which the ventral tegmental dopamine system has been rendered inactive do not seek food, and will starve to death if left to themselves, but if food is placed in their mouths they will consume it and show expressions indicative of pleasure.

A clinical study from January 2019 that assessed the effect of a dopamine precursor (levodopa), dopamine antagonist (risperidone), and a placebo on reward responses to music¬†‚Äì including the degree of pleasure experienced during musical chills, as measured by changes in electrodermal activity as well as subjective ratings¬†‚Äì found that the manipulation of dopamine neurotransmission bidirectionally regulates pleasure cognition (specifically, the hedonic impact of music) in human subjects. This research demonstrated that increased dopamine neurotransmission acts as a &quot;sine qua non&quot; condition for pleasurable hedonic reactions to music in humans.

A study published in Nature in 1998 found evidence that playing video games releases dopamine in the human striatum. This dopamine is associated with learning, behavior reinforcement, attention, and sensorimotor integration. Researchers used positron emission tomography scans and 11C-labelled raclopride to track dopamine levels in the brain during goal-directed motor tasks and found that dopamine release was positively correlated with task performance and was greatest in the ventral striatum. This was the first study to demonstrate the behavioral conditions under which dopamine is released in humans. It highlights the ability of positron emission tomography to detect neurotransmitter fluxes during changes in behavior. According to research, potentially problematic video game use is related to personality traits such as low self-esteem and low self-efficacy, anxiety, aggression, and clinical symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders. Additionally, the reasons individuals play video games vary and may include coping, socialization, and personal satisfaction. The DSM-5 defines Internet Gaming Disorder as a mental disorder closely related to Gambling Disorder. This has been supported by some researchers but has also caused controversy.

===Outside the central nervous system===

Dopamine does not cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier, so its synthesis and functions in peripheral areas are to a large degree independent of its synthesis and functions in the brain. A substantial amount of dopamine circulates in the bloodstream, but its functions there are not entirely clear. Dopamine is found in blood plasma at levels comparable to those of epinephrine, but in humans, over 95% of the dopamine in the plasma is in the form of dopamine sulfate, a conjugate produced by the enzyme sulfotransferase 1A3/1A4 acting on free dopamine. The bulk of this dopamine sulfate is produced in the mesenteric organs. The production of dopamine sulfate is thought to be a mechanism for detoxifying dopamine that is ingested as food or produced by the digestive process‚Äîlevels in the plasma typically rise more than fifty-fold after a meal. Dopamine sulfate has no known biological functions and is excreted in urine.

The relatively small quantity of unconjugated dopamine in the bloodstream may be produced by the sympathetic nervous system, the digestive system, or possibly other organs. It may act on dopamine receptors in peripheral tissues, or be metabolized, or be converted to norepinephrine by the enzyme dopamine beta hydroxylase, which is released into the bloodstream by the adrenal medulla. Some dopamine receptors are located in the walls of arteries, where they act as a vasodilator and an inhibitor of norepinephrine release from postganglionic sympathetic nerves terminals (dopamine can inhibit norepinephrine release by acting on presynaptic dopamine receptors, and also on presynaptic Œ±-1 receptors, like norepinephrine itself). These responses might be activated by dopamine released from the carotid body under conditions of low oxygen, but whether arterial dopamine receptors perform other biologically useful functions is not known.

Beyond its role in modulating blood flow, there are several peripheral systems in which dopamine circulates within a limited area and performs an exocrine or paracrine function. The peripheral systems in which dopamine plays an important role include the immune system, the kidneys and the pancreas.

====Immune system====

In the immune system dopamine acts upon receptors present on immune cells, especially lymphocytes. Dopamine can also affect immune cells in the spleen, bone marrow, and circulatory system. In addition, dopamine can be synthesized and released by immune cells themselves. The main effect of dopamine on lymphocytes is to reduce their activation level. The functional significance of this system is unclear, but it affords a possible route for interactions between the nervous system and immune system, and may be relevant to some autoimmune disorders.

====Kidneys====

The renal dopaminergic system is located in the cells of the nephron in the kidney, where all subtypes of dopamine receptors are present. Dopamine is also synthesized there, by tubule cells, and discharged into the tubular fluid. Its actions include increasing the blood supply to the kidneys, increasing the glomerular filtration rate, and increasing the excretion of sodium in the urine. Hence, defects in renal dopamine function can lead to reduced sodium excretion and consequently result in the development of high blood pressure. There is strong evidence that faults in the production of dopamine or in the receptors can result in a number of pathologies including oxidative stress, edema, and either genetic or essential hypertension. Oxidative stress can itself cause hypertension. Defects in the system can also be caused by genetic factors or high blood pressure.

====Pancreas====

In the pancreas the role of dopamine is somewhat complex. The pancreas consists of two parts, an exocrine and an endocrine component. The exocrine part synthesizes and secretes digestive enzymes and other substances, including dopamine, into the small intestine. The function of this secreted dopamine after it enters the small intestine is not clearly established‚Äîthe possibilities include protecting the intestinal mucosa from damage and reducing gastrointestinal motility (the rate at which content moves through the digestive system).

The pancreatic islets make up the endocrine part of the pancreas, and synthesize and secrete hormones including insulin into the bloodstream. There is evidence that the beta cells in the islets that synthesize insulin contain dopamine receptors, and that dopamine acts to reduce the amount of insulin they release. The source of their dopamine input is not clearly established‚Äîit may come from dopamine that circulates in the bloodstream and derives from the sympathetic nervous system, or it may be synthesized locally by other types of pancreatic cells.

==Medical uses==

Dopamine as a manufactured medication is sold under the trade names Intropin, Dopastat, and Revimine, among others. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is most commonly used as a stimulant drug in the treatment of severe low blood pressure, slow heart rate, and cardiac arrest. It is especially important in treating these in newborn infants. It is given intravenously. Since the half-life of dopamine in plasma is very short‚Äîapproximately one minute in adults, two minutes in newborn infants and up to five minutes in preterm infants‚Äîit is usually given in a continuous intravenous drip rather than a single injection.

Its effects, depending on dosage, include an increase in sodium excretion by the kidneys, an increase in urine output, an increase in heart rate, and an increase in blood pressure. At low doses it acts through the sympathetic nervous system to increase heart muscle contraction force and heart rate, thereby increasing cardiac output and blood pressure. Higher doses also cause vasoconstriction that further increases blood pressure. Older literature also describes very low doses thought to improve kidney function without other consequences, but recent reviews have concluded that doses at such low levels are not effective and may sometimes be harmful. While some effects result from stimulation of dopamine receptors, the prominent cardiovascular effects result from dopamine acting at Œ±1, Œ≤1, and Œ≤2 adrenergic receptors.

Side effects of dopamine include negative effects on kidney function and irregular heartbeats. The LD50, or lethal dose which is expected to prove fatal in 50% of the population, has been found to be: 59¬†mg/kg (mouse; administered intravenously); 95¬†mg/kg (mouse; administered intraperitoneally); 163¬†mg/kg (rat; administered intraperitoneally); 79¬†mg/kg (dog; administered intravenously).

==Disease, disorders, and pharmacology==
The dopamine system plays a central role in several significant medical conditions, including Parkinson&#x27;s disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Tourette syndrome, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and addiction. Aside from dopamine itself, there are many other important drugs that act on dopamine systems in various parts of the brain or body. Some are used for medical or recreational purposes, but neurochemists have also developed a variety of research drugs, some of which bind with high affinity to specific types of dopamine receptors and either agonize or antagonize their effects, and many that affect other aspects of dopamine physiology, including dopamine transporter inhibitors, VMAT inhibitors, and enzyme inhibitors.

=== Aging brain ===

A number of studies have reported an age-related decline in dopamine synthesis and dopamine receptor density (i.e., the number of receptors) in the brain. This decline has been shown to occur in the striatum and extrastriatal regions. Decreases in the D1, D2, and D3 receptors are well documented. The reduction of dopamine with aging is thought to be responsible for many neurological symptoms that increase in frequency with age, such as decreased arm swing and increased rigidity. Changes in dopamine levels may also cause age-related changes in cognitive flexibility.

=== Multiple sclerosis ===
Studies reported that dopamine imbalance influences the fatigue in multiple sclerosis. In patients with multiple sclerosis, dopamine inhibits production of IL-17 and IFN-Œ≥ by peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

===Parkinson&#x27;s disease===

Parkinson&#x27;s disease is an age-related disorder characterized by movement disorders such as stiffness of the body, slowing of movement, and trembling of limbs when they are not in use. In advanced stages it progresses to dementia and eventually death. The main symptoms are caused by the loss of dopamine-secreting cells in the substantia nigra. These dopamine cells are especially vulnerable to damage, and a variety of insults, including encephalitis (as depicted in the book and movie &quot;Awakenings&quot;), repeated sports-related concussions, and some forms of chemical poisoning such as MPTP, can lead to substantial cell loss, producing a parkinsonian syndrome that is similar in its main features to Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Most cases of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, however, are idiopathic, meaning that the cause of cell death cannot be identified.

The most widely used treatment for parkinsonism is administration of L-DOPA, the metabolic precursor for dopamine. L-DOPA is converted to dopamine in the brain and various parts of the body by the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase. L-DOPA is used rather than dopamine itself because, unlike dopamine, it is capable of crossing the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. It is often co-administered with an enzyme inhibitor of peripheral decarboxylation such as carbidopa or benserazide, to reduce the amount converted to dopamine in the periphery and thereby increase the amount of L-DOPA that enters the brain. When L-DOPA is administered regularly over a long time period, a variety of unpleasant side effects such as dyskinesia often begin to appear; even so, it is considered the best available long-term treatment option for most cases of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

L-DOPA treatment cannot restore the dopamine cells that have been lost, but it causes the remaining cells to produce more dopamine, thereby compensating for the loss to at least some degree. In advanced stages the treatment begins to fail because the cell loss is so severe that the remaining ones cannot produce enough dopamine regardless of L-DOPA levels. Other drugs that enhance dopamine function, such as bromocriptine and pergolide, are also sometimes used to treat Parkinsonism, but in most cases L-DOPA appears to give the best trade-off between positive effects and negative side-effects.

Dopaminergic medications that are used to treat Parkinson&#x27;s disease are sometimes associated with the development of a dopamine dysregulation syndrome, which involves the overuse of dopaminergic medication and medication-induced compulsive engagement in natural rewards like gambling and sexual activity. The latter behaviors are similar to those observed in individuals with a behavioral addiction.

===Drug addiction and psychostimulants===

Cocaine, substituted amphetamines (including methamphetamine), Adderall, methylphenidate (marketed as Ritalin or Concerta), and other psychostimulants exert their effects primarily or partly by increasing dopamine levels in the brain by a variety of mechanisms. Cocaine and methylphenidate are dopamine transporter blockers or reuptake inhibitors; they non-competitively inhibit dopamine reuptake, resulting in increased dopamine concentrations in the synaptic cleft. Like cocaine, substituted amphetamines and amphetamine also increase the concentration of dopamine in the synaptic cleft, but by different mechanisms.

The effects of psychostimulants include increases in heart rate, body temperature, and sweating; improvements in alertness, attention, and endurance; increases in pleasure produced by rewarding events; but at higher doses agitation, anxiety, or even loss of contact with reality. Drugs in this group can have a high addiction potential, due to their activating effects on the dopamine-mediated reward system in the brain. However some can also be useful, at lower doses, for treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. An important differentiating factor is the onset and duration of action. Cocaine can take effect in seconds if it is injected or inhaled in free base form; the effects last from 5 to 90 minutes. This rapid and brief action makes its effects easily perceived and consequently gives it high addiction potential. Methylphenidate taken in pill form, in contrast, can take two hours to reach peak levels in the bloodstream, and depending on formulation the effects can last for up to 12¬†hours. These longer acting formulations have the benefit of reducing the potential for abuse, and improving adherence for treatment by using more convenient dosage regimens.
A variety of addictive drugs produce an increase in reward-related dopamine activity. Stimulants such as nicotine, cocaine and methamphetamine promote increased levels of dopamine which appear to be the primary factor in causing addiction. For other addictive drugs such as the opioid heroin, the increased levels of dopamine in the reward system may play only a minor role in addiction. When people addicted to stimulants go through withdrawal, they do not experience the physical suffering associated with alcohol withdrawal or withdrawal from opiates; instead they experience craving, an intense desire for the drug characterized by irritability, restlessness, and other arousal symptoms, brought about by psychological dependence.

The dopamine system plays a crucial role in several aspects of addiction. At the earliest stage, genetic differences that alter the expression of dopamine receptors in the brain can predict whether a person will find stimulants appealing or aversive. Consumption of stimulants produces increases in brain dopamine levels that last from minutes to hours. Finally, the chronic elevation in dopamine that comes with repetitive high-dose stimulant consumption triggers a wide-ranging set of structural changes in the brain that are responsible for the behavioral abnormalities which characterize an addiction. Treatment of stimulant addiction is very difficult, because even if consumption ceases, the craving that comes with psychological withdrawal does not. Even when the craving seems to be extinct, it may re-emerge when faced with stimuli that are associated with the drug, such as friends, locations and situations. Association networks in the brain are greatly interlinked.

===Psychosis and antipsychotic drugs===

Psychiatrists in the early 1950s discovered that a class of drugs known as typical antipsychotics (also known as major tranquilizers), were often effective at reducing the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. The introduction of the first widely used antipsychotic, chlorpromazine (Thorazine), in the 1950s, led to the release of many patients with schizophrenia from institutions in the years that followed. By the 1970s researchers understood that these typical antipsychotics worked as antagonists on the D2 receptors. This realization led to the so-called dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia, which postulates that schizophrenia is largely caused by hyperactivity of brain dopamine systems. The dopamine hypothesis drew additional support from the observation that psychotic symptoms were often intensified by dopamine-enhancing stimulants such as methamphetamine, and that these drugs could also produce psychosis in healthy people if taken in large enough doses. In the following decades other atypical antipsychotics that had fewer serious side effects were developed. Many of these newer drugs do not act directly on dopamine receptors, but instead produce alterations in dopamine activity indirectly. These drugs were also used to treat other psychoses. Antipsychotic drugs have a broadly suppressive effect on most types of active behavior, and particularly reduce the delusional and agitated behavior characteristic of overt psychosis.

Later observations, however, have caused the dopamine hypothesis to lose popularity, at least in its simple original form. For one thing, patients with schizophrenia do not typically show measurably increased levels of brain dopamine activity. Even so, many psychiatrists and neuroscientists continue to believe that schizophrenia involves some sort of dopamine system dysfunction. As the &quot;dopamine hypothesis&quot; has evolved over time, however, the sorts of dysfunctions it postulates have tended to become increasingly subtle and complex.

Psychopharmacologist Stephen M. Stahl suggested in a review of 2018 that in many cases of psychosis, including schizophrenia, three interconnected networks based on dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate ‚Äì each on its own or in various combinations ‚Äì contributed to an overexcitation of dopamine D2 receptors in the ventral striatum.

===Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder===
Altered dopamine neurotransmission is implicated in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a condition associated with impaired cognitive control, in turn leading to problems with regulating attention (attentional control), inhibiting behaviors (inhibitory control), and forgetting things or missing details (working memory), among other problems. There are genetic links between dopamine receptors, the dopamine transporter, and ADHD, in addition to links to other neurotransmitter receptors and transporters. The most important relationship between dopamine and ADHD involves the drugs that are used to treat ADHD. Some of the most effective therapeutic agents for ADHD are psychostimulants such as methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta) and amphetamine (Evekeo, Adderall, Dexedrine), drugs that increase both dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the brain. The clinical effects of these psychostimulants in treating ADHD are mediated through the indirect activation of dopamine and norepinephrine receptors, specifically dopamine receptor D1 and adrenoceptor Œ±2, in the prefrontal cortex.

===Pain===
Dopamine plays a role in pain processing in multiple levels of the central nervous system including the spinal cord, periaqueductal gray, thalamus, basal ganglia, and cingulate cortex. Decreased levels of dopamine have been associated with painful symptoms that frequently occur in Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Abnormalities in dopaminergic neurotransmission also occur in several painful clinical conditions, including burning mouth syndrome, fibromyalgia, and restless legs syndrome.

===Nausea===
Nausea and vomiting are largely determined by activity in the area postrema in the medulla of the brainstem, in a region known as the chemoreceptor trigger zone. This area contains a large population of type D2 dopamine receptors. Consequently, drugs that activate D2 receptors have a high potential to cause nausea. This group includes some medications that are administered for Parkinson&#x27;s disease, as well as other dopamine agonists such as apomorphine. In some cases, D2-receptor antagonists such as metoclopramide are useful as anti-nausea drugs.

Fear and anxiety

Simultaneous positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), have shown that the amount of dopamine release is dependent on the strength of conditioned fear response and is linearly coupled to learning-induced activity in the amygdala. Dopamine is generally linked to reward learning, but it also plays a key role in fear learning and extinction by helping to form, store and update fear memories through its interaction with other brain regions like amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex and striatum.

==Comparative biology and evolution==
===Microorganisms===
There are no reports of dopamine in archaea, but it has been detected in some types of bacteria and in the protozoan called &quot;Tetrahymena&quot;. Perhaps more importantly, there are types of bacteria that contain homologs of all the enzymes that animals use to synthesize dopamine. It has been proposed that animals derived their dopamine-synthesizing machinery from bacteria, via horizontal gene transfer that may have occurred relatively late in evolutionary time, perhaps as a result of the symbiotic incorporation of bacteria into eukaryotic cells that gave rise to mitochondria.

===Animals===
Dopamine is used as a neurotransmitter in most multicellular animals. In sponges there is only a single report of the presence of dopamine, with no indication of its function; however, dopamine has been reported in the nervous systems of many other radially symmetric species, including the cnidarian jellyfish, hydra and some corals. This dates the emergence of dopamine as a neurotransmitter back to the earliest appearance of the nervous system, over 500 million years ago in the Cambrian Period. Dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter in vertebrates, echinoderms, arthropods, molluscs, and several types of worm.

In every type of animal that has been examined, dopamine has been seen to modify motor behavior. In the model organism, nematode &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;, it reduces locomotion and increases food-exploratory movements; in flatworms it produces &quot;screw-like&quot; movements; in leeches it inhibits swimming and promotes crawling. Across a wide range of vertebrates, dopamine has an &quot;activating&quot; effect on behavior-switching and response selection, comparable to its effect in mammals.

Dopamine has also consistently been shown to play a role in reward learning, in all animal groups. As in all vertebrates ‚Äì invertebrates such as roundworms, flatworms, molluscs and common fruit flies can all be trained to repeat an action if it is consistently followed by an increase in dopamine levels. In fruit flies, distinct elements for reward learning suggest a modular structure to the insect reward processing system that broadly parallels that in the mammalian one. For example, dopamine regulates short- and long-term learning in monkeys; in fruit flies, different groups of dopamine neurons mediate reward signals for short- and long-term memories.

It had long been believed that arthropods were an exception to this with dopamine being seen as having an adverse effect. Reward was seen to be mediated instead by octopamine, a neurotransmitter closely related to norepinephrine. More recent studies, however, have shown that dopamine does play a part in reward learning in fruit flies. It has also been found that the rewarding effect of octopamine is due to its activating a set of dopaminergic neurons not previously accessed in the research.

===Plants===

Many plants, including a variety of food plants, synthesize dopamine to varying degrees. The highest concentrations have been observed in bananas‚Äîthe fruit pulp of red and yellow bananas contains dopamine at levels of 40 to 50 parts per million by weight. Potatoes, avocados, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts may also contain dopamine at levels of 1 part per million or more; oranges, tomatoes, spinach, beans, and other plants contain measurable concentrations less than 1 part per million. The dopamine in plants is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine, by biochemical mechanisms similar to those that animals use. It can be metabolized in a variety of ways, producing melanin and a variety of alkaloids as byproducts. The functions of plant catecholamines have not been clearly established, but there is evidence that they play a role in the response to stressors such as bacterial infection, act as growth-promoting factors in some situations, and modify the way that sugars are metabolized. The receptors that mediate these actions have not yet been identified, nor have the intracellular mechanisms that they activate.

Dopamine consumed in food cannot act on the brain, because it cannot cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. However, there are also a variety of plants that contain L-DOPA, the metabolic precursor of dopamine. The highest concentrations are found in the leaves and bean pods of plants of the genus &quot;Mucuna&quot;, especially in &quot;Mucuna pruriens&quot; (velvet beans), which have been used as a source for L-DOPA as a drug. Another plant containing substantial amounts of L-DOPA is &quot;Vicia faba&quot;, the plant that produces fava beans (also known as &quot;broad beans&quot;). The level of L-DOPA in the beans, however, is much lower than in the pod shells and other parts of the plant. The seeds of &quot;Cassia&quot; and &quot;Bauhinia&quot; trees also contain substantial amounts of L-DOPA.

In a species of marine green algae &quot;Ulvaria obscura&quot;, a major component of some algal blooms, dopamine is present in very high concentrations, estimated at 4.4% of dry weight. There is evidence that this dopamine functions as an anti-herbivore defense, reducing consumption by snails and isopods.

===As a precursor for melanin===
Melanins are a family of dark-pigmented substances found in a wide range of organisms. Chemically they are closely related to dopamine, and there is a type of melanin, known as dopamine-melanin, that can be synthesized by oxidation of dopamine via the enzyme tyrosinase. The melanin that darkens human skin is not of this type: it is synthesized by a pathway that uses L-DOPA as a precursor but not dopamine. However, there is substantial evidence that the neuromelanin that gives a dark color to the brain&#x27;s substantia nigra is at least in part dopamine-melanin.

Dopamine-derived melanin probably appears in at least some other biological systems as well. Some of the dopamine in plants is likely to be used as a precursor for dopamine-melanin. The complex patterns that appear on butterfly wings, as well as black-and-white stripes on the bodies of insect larvae, are also thought to be caused by spatially structured accumulations of dopamine-melanin.

==History and development==

Dopamine was first synthesized in 1910 by George Barger and James Ewens at Wellcome Laboratories in London, England and first identified in the human brain by Katharine Montagu in 1957. It was named dopamine because it is a monoamine whose precursor in the Barger-Ewens synthesis is 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (levodopa or L-DOPA). Dopamine&#x27;s function as a neurotransmitter was first recognized in 1958 by Arvid Carlsson and Nils-√Öke Hillarp at the Laboratory for Chemical Pharmacology of the National Heart Institute of Sweden. Carlsson was awarded the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for showing that dopamine is not only a precursor of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline), but is also itself a neurotransmitter.

===Polydopamine===
Research motivated by adhesive polyphenolic proteins in mussels led to the discovery in 2007 that a wide variety of materials, if placed in a solution of dopamine at slightly basic pH, will become coated with a layer of polymerized dopamine, often referred to as polydopamine. This polymerized dopamine forms by a spontaneous oxidation reaction, and is formally a type of melanin. Furthermore, dopamine self-polymerization can be used to modulate the mechanical properties of peptide-based gels. Synthesis of polydopamine usually involves reaction of dopamine hydrochloride with Tris as a base in water. The structure of polydopamine is unknown.

Polydopamine coatings can form on objects ranging in size from nanoparticles to large surfaces. Polydopamine layers have chemical properties that have the potential to be extremely useful, and numerous studies have examined their possible applications. At the simplest level, they can be used for protection against damage by light, or to form capsules for drug delivery. At a more sophisticated level, their adhesive properties may make them useful as substrates for biosensors or other biologically active macromolecules.

<text>The Organisation of African Unity (OAU; , OUA) was an African intergovernmental organization established on 25 May 1963 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, with 33 signatory governments. Some of the key aims of the OAU were to encourage political and economic integration among member states, and to eradicate colonialism and neo-colonialism from the African continent.

The absence of an armed force like the United Nations peacekeepers left the organization with no means to enforce its decisions. It was also unwilling to become involved in the internal affairs of member nations, prompting some critics to claim the OAU as ineffective in taking decisive action. Recognizing this, in September 1999 the OAU issued the Sirte Declaration, calling for a new body to take its place. On 9 July 2002, the OAU&#x27;s Chairman, South African President Thabo Mbeki, formally dissolved the OAU and replaced it with the African Union (AU), its immediate successor, which upholds many of the founding principles of the OAU.

==History==

The inception of the OAU&#x27;s establishment was the Sanniquellie Pledge at the First West African Summit Conference held in Sanniquellie, Liberia on 15‚Äì19 July 1959. President Tubman of Liberia hosted President Tour√© of Guinea, and Prime Minister Nkrumah of Ghana, and the three pledged to work together for the formation of a &quot;Community of Independent African States&quot;.

The OAU was founded in May 1963 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, by 32 African states with the main aim of bringing the African nations together and resolve the issues within the continent. Its first ever conference was held on 1 May 1963 in Addis Ababa. At that conference, the late Gambian historianand one of the leading Gambian nationalists and Pan-Africanists at the timeAlieu Ebrima Cham Joof delivered a speech in front of the member states, in which he said:

:It is barely 75 years when the European Powers sat around the table in Germany each holding a dagger to carve up Africa for its own benefit.‚Ä¶ Your success will inspire and speed up the freedom and total independence of the African continent and eradicate imperialism and colonialism from the continent and eventually neo-colonialism from the globe‚Ä¶ Your failure, which no true African in Africa is praying for, will prolong our struggle with bitterness and disappointment. I, therefore, adjure that you ignore any suggestion outside Africa and holding that the present civilization, which some of the big powered are boasting of, sprang up from Africa, and realising that the entire world has something earthly to learn from Africa, you would endeavour your utmost to come to agreement, save Africa from the clutches of neo-colonialism and resurrect African dignity, manhood and national stability.

==Aims==

The OAU had the following primary aims:

* To co-ordinate and intensify the co-operation of African states in order to achieve a better life for the people of Africa.
* To defend the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of African states.
* The OAU was also dedicated to the eradication of all forms of colonialism and white minority rule as, when it was established, there were several states that had not yet won their independence or were white minority-ruled. South Africa and Angola were two such countries. The OAU proposed two ways of ridding the continent of colonialism and white minority rule. First, it would defend the interests of independent countries and help to pursue the independence those of still-colonised ones. Secondly, it would remain neutral in terms of world affairs, preventing its members from being controlled once more by outside powers.

A Liberation Committee was established to aid independence movements and look after the interests of already-independent states. The OAU also aimed to stay neutral in terms of global politics, which would prevent them from being controlled once more by outside forces ‚Äì an especial danger with the Cold War.

The OAU had other aims, too:

* Ensure that all Africans enjoyed human rights.
* Raise the living standards of all Africans.
* Settle arguments and disputes between members ‚Äì not through fighting but rather peaceful and diplomatic negotiation.

Soon after achieving independence, a number of African states expressed a growing desire for more unity within the continent. Not everyone was agreed on how this unity could be achieved, however, and two opinionated groups emerged in this respect:

* The Casablanca bloc, led by Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, wanted a federation of all African countries. Aside from Ghana, it comprised also Algeria, Guinea, Morocco, Egypt, Mali and Libya. Founded in 1961, its members were described as &quot;progressive states&quot;.
* The Monrovian bloc, led by Senghor of Senegal, felt that unity should be achieved gradually, through economic cooperation. It did not support the notion of a political federation. Its other members were Nigeria, Liberia, Ethiopia, and most of the former French colonies.

Some of the initial discussions took place at Sanniquellie, Liberia. The dispute was eventually resolved when Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie I invited the two groups to Addis Ababa, where the OAU and its headquarters were subsequently established. The Charter of the Organisation was signed by 32 independent African states.

At the time of the OAU&#x27;s disbanding, 53 out of the 54 African states were members; Morocco left on 12 November 1984 following the admission of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic as the government of Western Sahara in 1982.

==Criticism and praise==
The organisation was widely derided as a bureaucratic &quot;talking shop&quot; with little power. It struggled to enforce its decisions, and its lack of armed force made intervention exceedingly difficult. Civil wars in Nigeria and Angola continued unabated for years, and the OAU could do nothing to stop them.

The policy of non-interference in the affairs of member states also limited the effectiveness of the OAU. Thus, when human rights were violated, as in Uganda under Idi Amin in the 1970s, the OAU was powerless to stop them.

The Organisation was praised by Ghanaian former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan for bringing Africans together. Nevertheless, critics argue that, in its 39 years of existence, the OAU did little to protect the rights and liberties of African citizens from their own political leaders, often dubbing it as a &quot;Dictators&#x27; Club&quot; or &quot;Dictators&#x27; Trade Union&quot;.

The OAU was, however, successful in some respects. Many of its members were members of the UN, too, and they stood together within the latter organisation to safeguard African interests ‚Äì especially in respect of lingering colonialism. Its pursuit of African unity, therefore, was in some ways successful.

Total unity was difficult to achieve, however, as the OAU was largely divided. The former French colonies, still dependent on France, had formed the Monrovia Group, and there was a further split between those that supported the United States and those that supported the USSR in the Cold War of ideologies. The pro-Socialist faction was led by Ghana&#x27;s Kwame Nkrumah, while F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny of the Ivory Coast led the pro-capitalists. Because of these divisions, it was difficult for the OAU to take action against states involved in internal conflicts because it could rarely reach an agreement on what was to be done.

The OAU did play a pivotal role in eradicating colonialism and white minority rule in Africa. It gave weapons, training and military bases to rebel groups fighting white minority and colonial rule. Groups such as the ANC and PAC, fighting apartheid, and ZANU and ZAPU, fighting to topple the government of Rhodesia, were aided in their endeavours by the OAU. African harbours were closed to the South African government, and South African aircraft were prohibited from flying over the rest of the continent. The UN was convinced by the OAU to expel South Africa from bodies such as the World Health Organization.

The OAU also worked with the UN to ease refugee problems. It set up the African Development Bank for economic projects intended to make Africa financially stronger. Although all African countries eventually won their independence, it remained difficult for them to become totally independent of their former colonisers. There was often continued reliance on the former colonial powers for economic aid, which often came with strings attached: loans had to be paid back at high interest-rates, and goods had to be sold to the aiders at low rates.

The US and Soviet Union intervened in post-colonial Africa in pursuit of their own objectives. Help was sometimes provided in the form of technology and aid-workers. Despite the goodwill and best intentions, the OAU consistently failed at its stated goal - that of the fight to keep &quot;Westerners&quot; (colonialists) out of, and only focus upon, African affairs. The Organisation still heavily depended on Western help (military and economic) to intervene in African affairs, despite African leaders&#x27; displeasure at dealing with the international community, especially Western countries.

<text>The Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad , often shortened to &quot;Rio Grande&quot;, D&amp;RG or D&amp;RGW, formerly the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railroad, was an American Class I railroad company. The railroad started as a narrow-gauge line running south from Denver, Colorado, in 1870. It served mainly as a transcontinental bridge line between Denver and Ogden, Utah. The Rio Grande was also a major origin of coal and mineral traffic.

The Rio Grande was a strong example of mountain railroading, with a motto of &quot;Through the Rockies, not around them&quot; and later &quot;Main line through the Rockies&quot;, both referring to the Rocky Mountains.

The D&amp;RGW operated the highest mainline rail line in the United States, over the Tennessee Pass in Colorado, and the famed routes through the Moffat Tunnel and the Royal Gorge. At its height, in 1889, the D&amp;RGW had the largest narrow-gauge railroad network in North America with of track interconnecting the states of Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah. Known for its independence, the D&amp;RGW operated the &quot;Rio Grande Zephyr&quot; until its discontinuation in 1983. This was the last private intercity passenger train in the United States until Brightline began service in Florida in 2018.

In 1988, the Rio Grande&#x27;s parent corporation, Rio Grande Industries, purchased Southern Pacific Transportation Company, and as the result of a merger, the larger Southern Pacific Railroad name was chosen for identity. The Rio Grande operated as a separate division of the Southern Pacific until 1992. Today, most former D&amp;RGW main lines are owned and operated by the Union Pacific Railroad while several branch lines are now operated as heritage railways by various companies.

== History ==

=== Overview ===
The Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railway (D&amp;RG) was incorporated on October27, 1870, by General William Jackson Palmer (1836‚Äì1909), and a board of four directors. It was originally announced that the new railroad would proceed south from Denver and travel an estimated south to El Paso via Pueblo, westward along the Arkansas River, and continue southward through the San Luis Valley of Colorado toward the Rio Grande. Closely assisted by his friend and new business partner Dr. William Bell, Palmer&#x27;s new &quot;Baby Road&quot; laid the first rails out of Denver on July28, 1871, and reached the location of the new town of Colorado Springs (then the Fountain Colony) by October21. Narrow gauge was chosen in part because construction and equipment costs would be relatively more affordable when weighed against that of the prevailing standard gauge. Palmer&#x27;s first hand impressions of the Ffestiniog Railway in Wales buoyed his interest in the narrow-gauge concept which would prove to be advantageous while conquering the mountainous regions of the Southwest. Eventually the route of the D&amp;RG would be amended (including a plan to continue south from Pueblo over Raton Pass) and added to as new opportunities and competition challenged the railroad&#x27;s expanding goals.

Feverish, competitive construction plans provoked the 1877‚Äì1880 war over right of way with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. Both rivals hired gunslingers and bought politicians while courts intervened to bring settlement to the disagreements. One anecdote of the conflict recounts June, 1879, when the Santa Fe defended its roundhouse in Pueblo with Dodge City toughs led by Bat Masterson; on that occasion, D&amp;RG treasurer R. F. Weitbrec paid the defenders to leave. In March, 1880, a Boston Court granted the AT&amp;SF the rights to Raton Pass, while the D&amp;RG paid an exorbitant $1.4million for the trackage extending through the Arkansas River&#x27;s Royal Gorge. The D&amp;RG&#x27;s possession of this route allowed quick access to the booming mining district of Leadville, Colorado. While this &quot;Treaty of Boston&quot; did not exactly favor the purist of original D&amp;RG intentions, the conquering of new mining settlements to the west and the future opportunity to expand into Utah was realized from this settlement.

By late 1880, William Bell had begun to organize railway construction in Utah that would become the Palmer controlled Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railway in mid-1881. The intention of the D&amp;RGW (aka the &quot;Western&quot;) was to work eastward from Provo to an eventual link with westward bound D&amp;RG in Colorado. This physical connection was realized near the Green River on March30, 1883, and by May of that year the D&amp;RG formally leased its Utah subsidiary as previously planned. By mid-1883, financial difficulties due to aggressive growth and expenditures led to a shake up among the D&amp;RG board of directors, and General Palmer resigned as president of the D&amp;RG in August, 1883, while retaining that position with the Western. Frederick Lovejoy would soon fill Palmer&#x27;s vacated seat on the D&amp;RG, the first in a succession of post Palmer presidents that would attempt to direct the railroad through future struggles and successes.

Following bitter conflict with the Rio Grande Western during lease disagreements and continued financial struggles, the D&amp;RG went into receivership in July, 1884, with court-appointed receiver William S. Jackson in control. Eventual foreclosure and sale of the original Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railway resulted within two years, and the new Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railroad took formal control of the property and holdings on July14, 1886, with Jackson appointed as president. General Palmer would continue as president of the Utah line until retirement (due to company re-organization) in 1901.

Throughout the railroad&#x27;s history its primary heavy repair shops were located south of Denver, Colorado in Burnham. They were built in 1871 and equipped to service both narrow gauge and standard gauge rolling stock. In 1922 the site received $3 million in upgrades, expanding the capacity to repair locomotives and cars. The last steam locomotive was serviced in 1956, at which time the locomotive department was converted to service diesel engines. The other major back shop site was in Salt Lake City, Utah, built in 1883. The shops in Alamosa, Colorado primarily serviced narrow gauge rolling stock.

=== Royal Gorge Route ===
The D&amp;RG built west from Pueblo reaching Ca√±on City in 1874. The line through the Royal Gorge reached Salida on May 20, 1880, and was pushed to Leadville later that same year. From Salida, the D&amp;RG pushed west over the Continental Divide at the Marshall Pass and reached Gunnison on August 6, 1881. From Gunnison the line entered the Black Canyon of the Gunnison River passing the famous Curecanti Needle seen in their famous &quot;Scenic Line of the World&quot; Herald. The tracks left the increasingly-difficult canyon at Cimmaron and passed over Cerro Summit, reaching Montrose on September 8, 1882. From Montrose, a line was laid north through Delta, reaching Grand Junction in March, 1883. The line continued building west until reaching the D&amp;RGW close to present day Green River which completed a narrow-gauge transcontinental link with the Rio Grande Western Railway to Salt Lake City, Utah.
The line from Pueblo to Leadville was upgraded in 1887 to three rails to accommodate both narrow-gauge and standard-gauge operation. Narrow-gauge branch lines were constructed to Chama, New Mexico, Durango, Silverton, Crested Butte, Lake City, Ouray and Somerset, Colorado.

The D&amp;RG round herald featuring the words &quot;Royal Gorge Route&quot; was applied to rolling stock beginning in 1926 (A similar herald had been used on company stationery earlier). In 1936, the words &quot;Moffat Tunnel&quot; were added, and in 1939, it was replaced by the &quot;Flying Rio Grande&quot; logo.

The route over Tennessee Pass had steep grades, and it was not uncommon to see trains running with midtrain and rear-end helpers. In 1997, a year after the D&amp;RGW/SP merger with Union Pacific, the UP closed the line. Although it has been out of service for more than two decades, the rails are still in usable condition, though many of the signals have been ravaged by time and vandals. In 2011, under a federal Beautification Grant, a private contractor removed and scrapped the railroad&#x27;s overhead signal pole lines.

=== San Juan Extension ===
The D&amp;RG also pushed west from Walsenburg, Colorado, over La Veta Pass (now &quot;Old La Veta Pass&quot;) by 1877. At the time the &#x27;Uptop&#x27; depot on Veta Pass, rising over in elevation, boasted the highest elevation for a narrow-gauge railroad. The railroad reached Alamosa by 1878. From Alamosa, a line was pushed south through Antonito eventually reaching Santa Fe, New Mexico (the Chili Line), and west as far as Creede, Colorado. A line containing one of the longest narrow-gauge tangent tracks in U.S. railroading () also linked Alamosa with Salida to the north. From Antonito a line was built over Cumbres Pass, along the Colorado-New Mexico border, reaching Durango, Colorado, in August, 1881 and continuing north to the rich mining areas around Silverton in July, 1882. A line was also constructed in 1902 as a standard-gauge line, perhaps in anticipation of possible standard gauging of the entire line, south from Durango to Farmington, New Mexico.

Part of the reason for this isolated change of gauge was that the Southern Pacific contemplated extending to access coal fields in the northern San Juan basin, had surveyors working there, and had incorporated a subsidiary, the &quot;Arizona &amp; Colorado Railroad Company&quot;, for this purpose. As a defensive move, this may have been enough to discourage the A&amp;C from proceeding to construction. Originally hauling mainly agricultural products, the Farmington line was converted to narrow gauge in 1923, and later delivered pipe and other construction materials to the local oil and natural gas industry into the 1960s.

Portions of the Alamosa‚ÄìDurango line survive to this day. The Walsenburg‚ÄìAlamosa‚ÄìAntonito line survives as the standard-gauge Colorado Pacific Rio Grande Railroad, with passenger excursion trains service provided by the Rio Grande Scenic Railroad. Two narrow-gauge segments survive as steam railroads, the Antonito‚ÄìChama line as the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad and Durango‚ÄìSilverton as the Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad.

Rio Grande Southern Railroad connected to San Juan Extension in Durango and went through the western edge of San Juan Mountains to Ridgway, Colorado on Montrose‚ÄìOuray branch.

=== Tennessee Pass ===
The D&amp;RG built west from Leadville over Tennessee Pass in an attempt to reach the mining areas around Aspen, Colorado, before its rival railroad in the area, the Colorado Midland, could build a line reaching there. The D&amp;RG built a line through Glenwood Canyon to Glenwood Springs, reaching Aspen in October, 1887. The D&amp;RG then joined with the Colorado Midland to build a line from Glenwood Springs connecting with D&amp;RG at Grand Junction. Originally considered a secondary branch route to Grand Junction, the entire route from Leadville to Grand Junction was upgraded to standard gauge in 1890, and the original narrow-gauge route via Marshall Pass became a secondary route.

==== Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western ====

The first (1881-1889) Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railway built a narrow-gauge line from Ogden, Utah via Soldier Summit, Utah to Grand Junction, Colorado. The railroad was reorganized as the Rio Grande Western Railway in 1889, as part of a finance plan to upgrade the line from narrow gauge to standard gauge, and built several branch lines in Utah to reach lucrative coal fields. It was the railway which Gustaf Nordenski√∂ld employed to haul boxcars of relics from the Mesa Verde, Colorado, cliff dwellings, in 1891, en route to the National Museum of Finland. In 1901, the Denver &amp; Rio Grande merged with the Rio Grande Western, consolidating in 1908. However, the railroad was weakened by speculators, who had used the Rio Grande&#x27;s equity to finance Western Pacific Railroad construction. The United States Railroad Administration (USRA) took over the D&amp;RG during World War I. In 1918, the D&amp;RG fell into receivership after the bankruptcy of Western Pacific. The Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&amp;RGW or DRGW) was incorporated in 1920, and formally emerged as the new re-organization of the old Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railroad on July 31, 1921.

=== Moffat Road ===
In 1931, the D&amp;RGW acquired the Denver and Salt Lake Western Railroad, a paper railroad subsidiary of the Denver and Salt Lake Railroad (D&amp;SL) which had acquired the rights to build a connection between the two railroads. After years of negotiation, the D&amp;RGW gained trackage rights on the D&amp;SL from Denver to the new cutoff. In 1932, the D&amp;RGW began construction of the Dotsero Cutoff east of Glenwood Springs to near Bond on the Colorado River, at a location called Orestod (Dotsero spelled backward). Construction was completed in 1934, giving Denver a direct transcontinental link to the west. The D&amp;RGW slipped into bankruptcy again in 1935. Emerging in 1947, it merged with the D&amp;SL on March3, 1947, gaining control of the &quot;Moffat Road&quot; through the Moffat Tunnel and a branch line from Bond to Craig, Colorado.

=== &quot;Fast Freights&quot; and the California Zephyr, 1950‚Äì1983 ===
Finally free from financial problems, the D&amp;RGW now possessed a direct route from Denver to Salt Lake City (the detour south through Pueblo and Tennessee Pass was no longer required for direct service), but a problem still remained: for transcontinental service, the Union Pacific&#x27;s more northerly line was far less mountainous (and, as a result, several hours faster). The D&amp;RGW&#x27;s solution was its &quot;fast freight&quot; philosophy, which employed multiple diesel locomotives pulling short, frequent trains. This philosophy helps to explain why the D&amp;RGW, despite its proximity to one of the nation&#x27;s most productive coal mining regions, retired coal-fueled steam locomotives as quickly as new, replacement diesels could be purchased. By 1956, the D&amp;RGW&#x27;s standard-gauge steam locomotives had been retired and scrapped. The reason for this was that unlike steam locomotives, diesel locomotives could easily be combined, using the diesels&#x27; multiple unit capabilities, to equip each train with the optimum horsepower which was needed to meet the D&amp;RGW&#x27;s aggressive schedule.

The D&amp;RGW&#x27;s sense of its unique geographical challenge found expression in the form of the &quot;California Zephyr&quot;, a passenger train which was jointly operated with the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&amp;Q) from Chicago to Denver, the D&amp;RGW from Denver to Salt Lake City, and the Western Pacific Railroad from Salt Lake City to Oakland, California (with ferry and bus connections to San Francisco). Unable to compete with the Union Pacific&#x27;s faster, less mountainous route and 39 3/4-hour schedules, the &quot;California Zephyr&quot; offered a more leisurely journey ‚Äì a &quot;rail cruise&quot; ‚Äì with ample vistas of the Rockies. Although the &quot;California Zephyr&quot; ran at full capacity and turned a modest profit from its 1949 inception through the late 1950s, by the mid-1960s the train was profitable only during the late spring, summer, and fall. In 1970, Western Pacific, claiming multimillion-dollar losses, dropped out. However, the D&amp;RGW refused to join the national Amtrak system, and continued to operate its share of the Zephyr equipment as the &quot;Rio Grande Zephyr&quot; between Denver and Salt Lake City. By 1983, however, citing continued losses in revenue, the D&amp;RGW decided to get out of the passenger business altogether and join Amtrak. With this move, Amtrak rerouted the &quot;San Francisco Zephyr&quot; to the Moffat Road line and rebranded it as the current incarnation of the &quot;California Zephyr&quot;.

Even as the D&amp;RGW exploited the best new standard-gauge technology to compete with other transcontinental carriers, the railroad continued to operate the surviving steam-powered narrow-gauge lines, including the famed narrow-gauge line between Durango and Silverton, Colorado. Most of the remaining narrow-gauge trackage was abandoned in the 1950s and 1960s. At the end of 1970, it operated of road on of track; that year it carried 7,733 ton-miles of revenue freight and 21 million passenger-miles.

Two of the most scenic routes survived in operation by the D&amp;RGW until they were sold to tourist railroad operators. The Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad assumed operation of the line between Antonito, Colorado, and Chama, New Mexico, in 1970. The last D&amp;RGW narrow-gauge line, from Durango to Silverton, was sold in 1981 to the Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad, exactly one hundred years after the line went into operation.

==== Consolidation with Southern Pacific ====
In 1988, Rio Grande Industries, the company that controlled the D&amp;RGW under the direction of Philip Anschutz, purchased the Southern Pacific Transportation Company (SP). The D&amp;RGW used Southern Pacific&#x27;s name with SP due to its name recognition among shippers. In time, the D&amp;RGW&#x27;s fast freight philosophy gave way to SP&#x27;s long-established practice of running long, slow trains. A contributing factor was the rising cost of diesel fuel, a trend that set in after the 1973 oil crisis, which gradually undermined the D&amp;RGW&#x27;s fuel-consuming &quot;fast freight&quot; philosophy. By the early 1990s, the combined Rio Grande/Southern Pacific system had lost much of the competitive advantage that made it attractive to transcontinental shippers, and became largely dependent on hauling the high-quality coal produced in the mine fields of Colorado and Utah.

D&amp;RGW locomotives retained their reporting marks and colors after the consolidation with the Southern Pacific and would do so until the Union Pacific merger. The one noticeable change was to Southern Pacific&#x27;s &quot;Bloody Nose&quot; paint scheme. The serif font on the sides of the locomotives was replaced by the Rio Grande&#x27;s &quot;speed lettering&quot;, which was utilized on all SP locomotives built or repainted after the merger.

=== Merger with Union Pacific ===

On September 11, 1996, Anschutz sold the combined D&amp;RGW/SP system with the parent company Southern Pacific Rail Corporation to the Union Pacific Corporation, partly in response to the earlier merger of Burlington Northern and Santa Fe which formed the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway. As the Union Pacific absorbed the D&amp;RGW into its system, signs of the fabled mountain railroad&#x27;s existence slowly faded. D&amp;RGW 5371, the only original D&amp;RGW locomotive in full Rio Grande paint on the Union Pacific, was retired by UP in December, 2008. D&amp;RGW 5371 was donated to the Utah State Railroad Museum at Ogden&#x27;s Union Station on August17, 2009, and resides in the Eccles Rail Center at the south end of the building. Many other Rio Grande locomotives used to run in service with Union Pacific but have been &quot;patch-renumbered,&quot; with a patch applied over the locomotive&#x27;s number and the number boards replaced, but most, if not all, have been repainted into Union Pacifics Armour Yellow since.

In 2006, Union Pacific unveiled UP 1989, an EMD SD70ACe painted in a stylized version of the D&amp;RGW color scheme. This unit is one of several SD70ACe locomotives in the Union Pacific heritage fleet has painted in stylized colors to help preserve the image of the railroads it has merged.

== Rolling stock ==
By the beginning of 1948 the company owned 318 steam locomotives, 62 diesel locomotives, 179 passenger cars and 14,662 freight cars. In 1962, there were 22 steam locomotives, 257 diesel locomotives, 96 passenger cars and 12,386 freight cars.

== Passenger trains ==

This is a partial list of D&amp;RGW passenger trains. Westbound trains had odd numbers, while eastbound trains had even numbers. Many of the trains were named and renamed as well as being re-numbered. There are over 180 names on a complete list of all the railroad&#x27;s named trains.

==Remnants==

The Union Pacific acquired all D&amp;RG owned assets at the time of the merger. The UP operates the former D&amp;RGW main line as part of its Central Corridor. However, several branch lines and other assets have been sold, abandoned or re-purposed. These include several presently operating heritage railways that trace their origins to the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western.

===Still-active and rebuilt features===
Active rail assets tracing their heritage to the D&amp;RGW that are not part of the Union Pacific network today include:
* California Zephyr ‚Äì formerly operated by the D&amp;RGW, is still active, but today operated by Amtrak.
**The Amtrak depots used for the California Zephyr in the cities of Helper, Green River and Glenwood Springs are the original depots built by the D&amp;RGW. The Amtrak depot in Grand Junction sits next to the abandoned D&amp;RGW depot. 
* FrontRunner ‚Äì a commuter rail service in Utah. The portion between Salt Lake City and Provo is a parallel track built alongside the former D&amp;RGW main.
* Red Line of the TRAX light rail system in Salt Lake City ‚Äì The southern half of this line uses the rebuilt right of way of an abandoned D&amp;RGW spur for the Bingham Canyon mine
* Rock and Rail LLC
* Colorado Pacific Rio Grande Railroad
* S Line ‚Äì a streetcar line in Salt Lake City that uses the rebuilt right-of-way of D&amp;RGW&#x27;s former Sugar House branch.
* Winter Park Express operated by Amtrak, formerly the Ski Train
* Utah Central Railway

===Heritage railways===
*Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad is a remnant of the narrow gauge San Juan Line (now isolated from the national rail network) that operates scenic trips over this route between Antonito, Colorado and Chama, New Mexico.
*Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad, which has been operating since 1881, provides scenic day trips from Durango to Silverton, along an isolated remnant of the San Juan line.
*Ghost Town &amp; Calico Railroad operates two narrow-gauge steam engines built in 1881 (one of which came from the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railroad and the other from the Rio Grande Southern Railroad) with passenger cars, freight cars and a caboose from this time period, as well as a Galloping Goose at Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm, which is a large amusement park in Buena Park, California.
*Heber Valley Historic Railroad provides scenic trips through the upper portion of Provo Canyon. The track was a branch of the D&amp;RGW main at Provo, but is today isolated from the national rail network.
*Rio Grande Scenic Railroad is a heritage train on a still-active branch of the former D&amp;RGW. However, it ceased operations in 2019.
*Royal Gorge Route Railroad operates over a portion of the intact, but otherwise disused Royal Gorge/Tennessee Pass line.

===Re-purposed assets===
*La Veta Pass Narrow Gauge Railroad Depot - A railroad depot on La Veta Pass used by the D&amp;RGW until 1899.
*D &amp; RGW Narrow Gauge Trestle - A trestle from the abandoned Marshall Pass line.
*The portion of the former D&amp;RG main between Salt Lake City and Ogden, Utah, abandoned after the merger with the Union Pacific, is now a rail trail.
*Similarly, the portion of the Thistle‚ÄìMarysvale branch through Marysvale Canyon is today a rail trail, which includes several tunnels.

===Museums===
The largest collection of surviving &quot;California Zephyr&quot; equipment can be found at the Western Pacific Railroad Museum at Portola, California, although this museum focuses on the Western Pacific Railroad, rather than the Rio Grande.

Museums that focus on the D&amp;RGW include:
*Colorado Railroad Museum
*Western Mining and Railroad Museum in Helper, Utah
*Union Station (Ogden, Utah)

Museums using former D&amp;RGW depots as buildings include:
*Denver and Rio Grande Depot (Montrose, Colorado)
*Denver and Rio Grande Western Depot (Salt Lake City)

<text>A television licence or broadcast receiving licence is a payment required in many countries for the reception of television broadcasts or the possession of a television set. In some countries, a licence is also required to own a radio or receive radio broadcasts. In such countries, some broadcasts are funded in full or in part by the licence fees. Licence fees are effectively a hypothecated tax to fund public broadcasting.

==History==

Radio broadcasters in the early 20th century needed to raise funds for their services. In some countries, this was achieved via advertising, while others adopted a compulsory subscription model with households that owned a radio set being required to purchase a licence. The United Kingdom was the first country to adopt compulsory public subscription with a licence, originally known as a wireless licence, used to fund the BBC. In most countries that introduced radio licensing, possession of a licence was simply an indication of having paid the fee. 

With the arrival of television, some countries created separate television licences. Other countries increased radio licence fees to cover the additional cost of television broadcasting, changing the name from &quot;radio licence&quot; to &quot;TV licence&quot; or &quot;receiver licence&quot;. Today, most countries fund public radio broadcasting from the same licence fee that is used for television, although a few still have separate radio licences. Some countries, such as the United Kingdom and Japan, have lower fees for households that only own monochrome television sets. In many countries, elderly and disabled consumers have a reduced or zero licence fee.

Faced with licence fee evasion, some countries chose to fund public broadcasters directly from taxation or via methods such as a co-payment with electricity billing. In some countries, national public broadcasters carry advertising.

In 1989, the Council of Europe created the European Convention on Transfrontier Television. Among other things, this regulates advertising. The treaty came into force in 1993 when it had been ratified by seven countries, including five EU member states. , 34 countries have acceded to the treaty.

==Television licensing by country==

Usage and costs of television licences vary greatly between countries. The Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago reports that two-thirds of countries in Europe and half of countries in Asia and Africa use television licences to fund public television. Television licensing is rare in the Americas, largely confined to British Overseas Territories. In some countries, radio channels and broadcasters&#x27; websites are also funded by a licence, giving access to radio and online services free of advertising.

==Television licences in Europe==
===Albania===
The Albanian licence fee is 100 lek√´ per month, paid as part of the electricity bill. This makes up part of RTSH&#x27;s funding: 58 per cent comes directly from the government through taxes with the remainder from commercials and the licence fee.

===Austria===
Under Austria&#x27;s TV and Radio Licence Law (&quot;Fernseh- und H√∂rfunklizenzrecht&quot;), all operational broadcast reception equipment must be registered. Since 1998, the (GIS) has been responsible for licence administration. GIS was renamed ORF-Beitragsservice (OBS) in 2024. It is a fully-owned subsidiary of the Austrian public broadcaster, (ORF) and an agency of the Federal Ministry of Finance. GIS aims to inform people about licensing, using a four-channel communication strategy consisting of:
* advertising campaigns in printed media, radio and television,
* direct mail,
* outlets such as post offices, banks, tobacconists and the five GIS Service Centres where people can register,
* field service customer consultants visiting households not yet registered.

In 2007 the total licensing income was ‚Ç¨682 million, 66 per cent of which was allocated to the ORF. The remaining 34 per cent was allocated to the federal government and local governments to fund cultural activities. GIS employs 191 people and has approximately 125 freelancers in the field service. 3.4 million Austrian households are registered with the GIS with 2.5 per cent evading the licence.

The television &amp; radio licence fee varies between states. As of 2022, Styria has the highest annual television licence cost, at ‚Ç¨343.80, and Salzburg and Burgenland have the highest annual radio licence cost, at ‚Ç¨94.92. Annual fees from July 2022 are:
Since 2024, the broadcasting fee has been replaced by a household tax that every household pays. It is ‚Ç¨15.30 per month. In the federal states of Burgenland, Carinthia, Styria and Tyrol, an additional state tax must be paid - this amounts to between ‚Ç¨3.10 and ‚Ç¨4.70 per month.

=== Bosnia and Herzegovina ===
The licence fee in Bosnia and Herzegovina is approximately ‚Ç¨46 per year. The Bosnian War and associated collapse of infrastructure caused very high evasion rates. This has partly been resolved by collecting the licence fee as part of each household&#x27;s monthly telephone bill. The licence fee is divided between three broadcasters:
* 50 per cent to BHRT (Radio and Television of Bosnia and Herzegovina), the main radio and television broadcaster in Bosnia and Herzegovina at national level, and Bosnia&#x27;s only member of the European Broadcasting Union.
* 25 per cent to RTVFBiH (Radio-Television of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina), a radio and television broadcaster that primarily serves the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
* 25 per cent to RTRS (Radio-Television of the Republika Srpska), a radio and television broadcaster which primarily serves the Republika Srpska.

===Croatia===
The licence fee in Croatia is regulated by the Croatian Radiotelevision Act, 2003. This law was written to ensure compliance with the European Convention on Transfrontier Television, which Croatia joined between 1999 and 2002. In addition to the licensing, the law regulates television advertising. Up to 9 per cent of air time on HRT may be given to advertising, with a limit of only one commercial during short breaks and no breaks during films. This is less than the limit permitted for commercial broadcasters.

The licence fee is charged to all owners of equipment capable of receiving television or radio broadcasts. It is set at 1.5 per cent of the previous year&#x27;s average net salary, which is ‚Ç¨137 per year per household with at least one radio or television receiver. It is the main source of revenue for the national broadcaster Hrvatska Radiotelevizija (HRT), and a secondary source of income for other national and local broadcasters, which receive a minority share. Within HRT, 66 per cent of the licence fee income goes to television and 34 per cent to radio.

===Czech Republic===
The licence fee in the Czech Republic is 135 Kƒç per month for television and 45 Kƒç per month for radio, amounting to 2160 Kƒç per year. Paid advertisements are not permitted on television except in narrowly defined circumstances during a transitional period. Each household that owns at least one television pays for one licence, regardless of how many televisions they own. Corporations and the self-employed must pay for a licence for each television and radio.

===Germany===
The licence fee in Germany is ‚Ç¨18.36 per month (‚Ç¨220 per annum) for all apartments, secondary residences, holiday homes and summer houses. Since 2003 it has been payable regardless of possession or use of television and radio. Businesses and institutions must pay, based on factors including numbers of employees, vehicles and, for hotels, beds. The fee is billed monthly but typically paid quarterly or yearly. It is collected by Beitragsservice von ARD, ZDF und Deutschlandradio which is sometimes criticized for its enforcement measures. Since 2013, only recipients of certain social benefits such as Arbeitslosengeld II or student loans and grants are exempt from the licence fee. People with certain disabilities can apply to pay a reduced fee of ‚Ç¨5.83. Low income, in general, is no longer a reason for exemption. Since the fee is billed to a person and not to a dwelling, empty dwellings are exempt.
The licence fee is used to fund the public broadcasters ZDF and Deutschlandradio, as well as the nine regional broadcasters of the ARD network. Together, they run 22 television channels (10 regional, 10 national, 2 international: Arte and 3sat) and 61 radio stations (58 regional, 3 national). Two national television stations and 32 regional radio stations carry limited advertising. The 14 regional regulatory authorities for private broadcasters are also funded by the licence fee, and in some states, non-profit community radio stations get small amounts of the licence fee. Germany&#x27;s international broadcaster, Deutsche Welle, is fully funded by the German federal government, though much of its new content is provided by the ARD.

Germany&#x27;s per capita budget for public broadcasting is close to the European average but the total is one of the largest in the world. In 2006, annual income from licence fees was more than ‚Ç¨7.9 billion.

The board of public broadcasters sued the German states for interference with their budgeting process, and on 11 September 2007, the Supreme Court decided in their favour. This effectively rendered the public broadcasters independent and self-governing.
Public broadcasters have announced that they are determined to use all available ways to reach their &quot;customers&quot; and as such have started a very broad Internet presence with media portals, news and TV programs. National broadcasters abandoned an earlier pledge to restrict their online activities. This resulted in newspapers taking court action against the ARD, claiming that its &quot;Tagessschau&quot; smartphone app was unfairly subsidised by the licence fee, to the detriment of free-market providers of news content apps. The case was dismissed with the court advising the two sides to find a compromise.

===Greece===
The licence fee in Greece is paid through electricity bills. It is charged to every electricity account, including private residences and businesses. There has been discussion of replacing it with a direct licence fee after complaints from people who do not own a television set. An often-quoted joke is that even the dead pay the licence fee, since graveyards have electricity bills.

Licensing income is paid to the state broadcaster, Ellinik√≠ Radiofon√≠a Tile√≥rasi (ERT). In June 2013, ERT was closed down to save money for the Greek government and licence fees were temporarily suspended.
In June 2015, ERT reopened and the licence fee resumed at a rate of ‚Ç¨36 per year.

===Ireland===

As of 2020, the cost of a television licence in Ireland is ‚Ç¨160 per year. The licence applies to premises so a separate licence is required for holiday homes or motor vehicles which contain a television. The licence must be paid for premises that have any equipment that can potentially decode TV signals, regardless of whether they view RT√â&#x27;s content. The licence is free to anyone over the age of 70, to some people over 66, to people on a disability allowance, and people who are blind (these licences are paid for by the state). The Irish post office, An Post, is responsible for the collection of the licence fee and commencement of prosecution proceedings in cases of non-payment, but An Post has signalled its intention to withdraw from its licence fee business. The licence fee makes up 50 per cent of the revenue of RT√â, the national broadcaster with the rest coming from radio and television advertisements. Some RT√â services have not historically relied on the licence for income, such as RT√â 2fm, RT√â Aertel, RT√â.ie but since 2012 RT√â 2FM has had some financial support from the licence. The RT√â Transmission Network operates on an entirely commercial basis.

Five per cent of the licence fee goes to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland&#x27;s &quot;Sound and Vision Scheme&quot;, which provides funds for programme production and restoration of archive material. From 2011 until 2018, five per cent of RT√â&#x27;s licence income was granted to TG4. RT√â is now required to provide TG4 with programming. The remainder of TG4&#x27;s funding is from direct state grants and commercial income.

===Italy===

The licence fee in Italy is charged to each household with a television set, regardless of use, and to all public premises with one or more televisions or radios. In 2016, the government reduced the licence fee to ‚Ç¨100 per household and incorporated it into electricity bills in an attempt to eliminate evasion, and as of 2018, the fee was ‚Ç¨90.00.

Sixty-six per cent of RAI&#x27;s income comes from the licence fee (up from about half of total income seven years ago), with another twenty-five per cent from advertising, which is aired pretty regularly every 20 minutes or so, with very few exceptions (football matches, special events, Eurovision Song Contest)

===Montenegro===

Under the Broadcasting Law of December 2002, each household and legal entity in Montenegro able to receive radio or television programmes is required to pay a broadcasting subscription fee. The monthly fee is ‚Ç¨3.50, or ‚Ç¨42.00 per annum. Funds are distributed, 
* 75 per cent to the republic&#x27;s public broadcasting radio and television services,
* 10 per cent to support local public broadcasting services
* 10 per cent to support commercial broadcasting services,
* 5 per cent to support the Broadcasting Agency of Montenegro.
The Broadcasting Agency of Montenegro collected the fee through telephone bills, but after the privatization of Telekom, the new owners, T-com, announced they would not administer the fee after July 2007.

=== Poland ===
As of 2023, the licence fee in Poland for a television set is 27.30 z≈Ç per month, or for radio only is 8.70 z≈Ç per month. One licence is required per household, irrespective of the number of sets. The fee is waived for people over 75. Public health institutions, nurseries, educational institutions, hospices and retirement homes need only one licence per building or building complex they occupy. Commercial premises need a licence for each set, including radios and televisions in company vehicles.

Around 60 per cent of the fee goes to Telewizja Polska with the rest going to Polskie Radio. Advertisements are allowed between programmes on public television but it is not permitted to interrupt its programmes for advertisements.

The licence is collected and maintained by the Polish post office, Poczta Polska. There is a major problem with licence evasion in Poland: in 2012 around 65 per cent of households evaded the licence fee (compared to an average of 10 per cent in the European Union), and in 2020, only 8 per cent of Polish households paid the licence fee. Reasons for non-payment include the opt-in system in which there is no effective means to compel people to register or to prosecute those who fail to do so. Licensing inspectors, who are usually postal workers, do not have the right of entry to inspect premises and must get the owner&#x27;s or occupier&#x27;s permission to enter. Also, the public media are frequently accused of producing pro-government propaganda and not being independent public broadcasters. Due to widespread non-payment of the licence fee, in 2020 the government gave a 2¬†billion z≈Çoty grant for public media.

===Portugal===

From September 2003, the R√°dio e Televis√£o de Portugal (RTP) was financed through government grants and the &quot;Taxa de Contribui√ß√£o Audiovisual&quot; (Portuguese for &quot;Broadcasting Contribution Tax&quot;), charged monthly through the electricity bills.
Following the 2010‚Äì2014 Portuguese financial crisis, government grants ended and RTP was financed only through the &quot;Taxa de Contribui√ß√£o Audiovisual&quot; and advertising. Since July 2016, the fee is ‚Ç¨2.85 + VAT per month.

RTP1 can broadcast only 6 minutes of commercial advertising per hour (commercial channels can broadcast 12 minutes per hour). RTP2 and the public radios stations have no commercial advertising. RTP3 and RTP Mem√≥ria can broadcast commercial advertising on cable, satellite and IPTV platforms but not on digital terrestrial television.

===Serbia===
Licence fees in Serbia are bundled together with electricity bills and collected monthly. Current fee is 349 RSD (the newest price, as of August 2024), which is about ‚Ç¨3.

===Slovenia===
Since June 2013, the annual licence fee in Slovenia is ‚Ç¨12.75 per household per month to receive both television and radio services, or ‚Ç¨3.77 per month for radio only, regardless of the number of devices capable of receiving television or radio broadcasts. Businesses and the self-employed pay this amount for each set and pay higher rates where they are intended for public viewing rather than private use by employees.

The licence fee is used to fund the national broadcaster RTV Slovenija. In 2007, the licence fee raised ‚Ç¨78.1¬†million, approximately 68 per cent of the broadcaster&#x27;s operating revenue. RTV Slovenija&#x27;s advertising income in 2007 was ‚Ç¨21.6¬†million.

===Switzerland===
Any household that receives radio or television programs from the Swiss national public broadcaster SRG SSR must be registered and pay licence fees. The fee is CHF 335 per year for TV and radio for single households, and CHF 670 for multiple households, e.g. nursing homes. Households unable to receive broadcast transmissions are exempt from the fees until 2023 if residents apply to opt out. Residential licence fees are collected by Serafe AG, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the insurance collections agency Secon. Non-payment of licence fees incurs fines of up to CHF 100,000. For businesses, the fee is on a scale based on the company&#x27;s annual turnover and is collected by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration.
The majority of the fee, CHF 1.2¬†billion, goes to SRG SSR, with the rest going to a collection of small regional radio and television broadcasters.

On 4 March 2018, there was a referendum on whether TV licensing should be scrapped, with the slogan &quot;No Billag&quot;, a reference to the previous collector of the licence fees. Parliament have advocated a no vote. Voters overwhelmingly rejected the proposal by 71.6 to 28.4 per cent and in all cantons. Following the vote, the fee was significantly reduced.

===Turkey===
A licence fee of up to 16 per cent is paid to the state broadcaster TRT by the producer or importer of the television receiving equipment. Consumers indirectly pay this fee when purchasing equipment. No registration is required for television receiving equipment, except for cellular phones as mandated by a separate law.

TRT also receives funding via advertisements. Previously a 2 per cent tax was added to monthly electricity bills but this has been abolished.

===United Kingdom===
A television licence is required for each household where television programmes are watched or recorded as they are broadcast, irrespective of the signal method (terrestrial, satellite, cable or the Internet). As of September 2016, users of BBC iPlayer must also have a television licence to watch on-demand television content from the service. As of 1 April 2017, after a price freeze that began in 2010, the cost of a licence may now increase to account for inflation. As of April 2024, the licence fee is ¬£169.50 for a colour and ¬£57 for a black and white television Licence As it is classified in law as a tax, evasion of licence fees is a criminal offence. 204,018 people were prosecuted or fined in 2014 for TV licence offences: 173,044 in England, 12,536 in Wales, 4,905 people in Northern Ireland and 15 in the Isle of Man.

The licence fee is used almost entirely to fund BBC domestic radio, television and internet services. Money received from the licence represents approximately 75 per cent of the cost of these services, with most of the remainder coming from the profits of BBC Studios, a commercial arm of the corporation which distributes content outside of the United Kingdom, and operates or licences BBC-branded television services and brands. The BBC also receives some funding from the Scottish Government via MG Alba to finance the BBC Alba Gaelic-language television service in Scotland. The BBC used to receive a direct government grant from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to fund television and radio services broadcast to other countries, such as the BBC World Service radio and BBC Arabic Television. These services run on a non-profit, non-commercial basis. The grant was abolished on 1 April 2014, leaving these services to be funded by the UK licence fee, a move which has caused some controversy.

Channel 4 is also a public television service but it is funded through advertising. The Welsh language S4C is funded through a combination of a direct grant from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and advertising, and receives some programming free of charge from the BBC. These other broadcasters are much smaller than the BBC.

In addition to public broadcasters, the United Kingdom has a wide range of commercial television funded by advertising and subscription. A television licence is still required of viewers who solely watch such commercial channels, although 74.9 per cent of the population watches BBC One in any given week, making it the most popular channel in the country. A similar licence existed for radio but was abolished in 1971.

==Television licences in Africa==
=== Ghana ===
The licence fee in Ghana was reintroduced in 2015, and is used to fund the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation (GBC). Households have to pay between GH¬¢36 and GH¬¢60 per year for using one or more televisions at home.

=== Mauritius ===
The licence fee in Mauritius is Rs 1,800 per year (around ‚Ç¨29), collected as part of the electricity bill. The fee provides 60 per cent of the income for Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation (MBC). Most of the remaining funds come from television and radio commercials. The introduction of private broadcasting in 2002 has put pressure on MBC&#x27;s commercial revenues. Private stations argue that MBC affects their profitability and they want the government to make MBC commercial-free.

=== Namibia ===
The licence fee in Namibia was N$204 (about ‚Ç¨23) in 2001. The fee is used to fund the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation.

=== South Africa ===
The licence fee in South Africa is R265 (about ‚Ç¨23) per annum (R312 per year if paid on a monthly basis) for television. A concessionary rate of R70 is available for those over 70, disabled persons and war veterans who are on social welfare. The licence fee partially funds the public broadcaster, the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), providing R972¬†million (almost ‚Ç¨90 million) in 2008‚Äì9. SABC derives much of its income from advertising. Proposals to abolish licensing have circulated since October 2009. The national carrier hopes to receive funding entirely from state subsidies and commercials.

==Television licences in Asia==
=== Japan ===
In Japan, the annual licence fee (, &quot;jushin-ryo&quot;) for terrestrial television broadcasts is ¬•14,205 (about ‚Ç¨88.34), and ¬•24,740 (about ‚Ç¨153.85) for those receiving satellite broadcasts. The fee is slightly less if paid by direct debit. There is a separate licence for monochrome TV, and fees are slightly less in Okinawa.

The Japanese licence fee pays for the national broadcaster, Nippon H≈çs≈ç Ky≈çkai (NHK).
Every household in Japan with a television set is required to have a licence, but in 2006 non-payment was described as &quot;epidemic&quot; following a series of scandals involving NHK. In 2005, it was reported that &quot;there is no fine or any other form of sanction for non-payment&quot;. The NHK Party, often called the Anti-NHK Party, was founded in 2013 as a single-issue political party to oppose the license fee, with its only policy being to encrypt NHK&#x27;s broadcast signal, meaning only those who watch NHK pay for it.

=== Pakistan ===
The television licence in Pakistan is Rs 420 (about ‚Ç¨1.45) per year, collected as a monthly charge on all electricity bills. The fee plus advertising revenue fund the Pakistan Television Corporation (PTV).

=== South Korea ===
In South Korea, the television licence fee () is collected for the Korean Broadcasting System and the Educational Broadcasting System. The fee is ‚Ç©30,000 per year (about ‚Ç¨20.67), and is bundled with electricity bills. It has stood at this level since 1981, and now makes up less than 40 per cent of KBS&#x27;s income and less than 8 per cent of EBS&#x27;s income. Its purpose is to maintain public broadcasting in South Korea, and give public broadcasters the resources to do their best to produce and broadcast public interest programs.

== Countries where the TV licence has been abolished ==

The following countries have had television licences, but subsequently abolished them:

===Australia===

Radio licence fees were introduced in Australia in the 1920s to fund privately owned broadcasters, which were not permitted to sell advertising. With the formation of the government-owned Australian Broadcasting Commission in 1932, licence fees were used to fund ABC broadcasts while privately-owned stations were permitted to seek revenue from advertising and sponsorship. Television licence fees were introduced in 1956 when the ABC began television transmissions. In 1964 a television licence, issued on a punched card, cost ¬£6 (A$12); the fine for not having a licence was ¬£100 (A$200).

All licence fees were abolished on 18 September 1974 by the Whitlam government on the basis that the near-universality of television and radio use meant that public funding was fairer. Since then, the ABC has been funded by government grants, now totalling around A$1.13¬†billion per year, plus its own commercial activities (merchandising, overseas sale of programmes, etc.).

===Belgium===
====Flemish region and Brussels====
The Flemish region of Belgium and Brussels abolished its television licence in 2001. The Flemish broadcaster VRT is now funded from general taxation.

==== Walloon region ====
From 1 January 2018, the licence fee in the Walloon region (encompassing the French and German-speaking communities) was abolished. Licences in effect at that remained payable until their period was up but were not renewed after that period.

The licence fee in Belgium&#x27;s Walloon region was ‚Ç¨100.00 for a television and ‚Ç¨0.00 for a radio in a vehicle. One licence was needed per household with a functional television receiver, regardless of the number, but each car with a radio had to have a separate car radio licence. Household radios did not require a licence. The money raised by the fee was used to fund Belgium&#x27;s French and German public broadcasters (RTBF and BRF respectively). The television licence fee was paid by people with surnames beginning with a letter between A and J between 1 April and 31 May inclusive, and those with surnames beginning with a letter between K and Z paid between 1 October and 30 November inclusive. People with certain disabilities were exempt from paying the fee. Hotels and similar lodging establishments paid an additional fee of ‚Ç¨50.00 for each additional functional TV receiver and paid between 1 January and 1 March inclusive.

=== Bulgaria ===
A fee for use of television and radio was included the fee in the Bulgarian Radio and Television Law passed in the 1990s. Following public criticism, the president vetoed the law. The Bulgarian National Assembly retained the power to impose a fee but added a temporary measure funding Bulgarian National Television (BNT) and Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) directly from the national budget. This funding mechanism has been retained since then.

===Canada===

The Radiotelegraph Act 1913 required anyone possessing a radio receiver to hold an &quot;Amateur Experimental Station&quot; licence, and pass an &quot;Amateur Experimental Certificate of Proficiency&quot;, demonstrating the ability to send and receive Morse code at five words per minute. In January 1922 the government introduced a Private Receiving Station licence for people who only intended to receive radio, rather than transmit. The receiving station licences initially cost $1 per year. Over time this increased to $2.50 to cover radio and television broadcasts by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). The licence fee was abolished in 1953 and replaced with a 15% excise tax on television equipment (including sets, picture tubes, and parts) to fund the CBC. This excise tax was phased out in 1958, with the CBC&#x27;s funding shifting primarily to parliamentary appropriations.

=== Cyprus ===
Cyprus had an indirect tax for CyBC, its state-run public broadcasting service, paid through electricity bills dependent on home size. It was abolished in the late 1990s and CyBC is now funded by advertising and government grants.

===Denmark===
Until 2022 a Danish media licence fee of 1353 kr (‚Ç¨182) per year was charged for any devices that could receive broadcast television. The majority of the licence fee funded the national radio and television broadcaster DR, with a smaller proportion funding TV 2&#x27;s regional services. The media licence was abolished in 2022. Funding for DR is now provided through general taxation. TV 2 is now funded through advertising revenue, and it receives indirect subsidies through favourable loans from the Danish state.

=== Finland ===

The television fee in Finland was between ‚Ç¨244.90 and ‚Ç¨253.80 per year for each household with a television. It was the primary source of funding for Yleisradio (Yle). In 2013 it was replaced with the Yle public broadcasting tax (, ), a progressive income tax up to ‚Ç¨163 per person. People with low incomes and under the age of eighteen years are exempt from the tax. Residents of √Öland did not have to pay the tax until 2020, but have been paying a media tax since 2021, which is currently (2024) at 123 euros per year.

===France===
Until 2022 a broadcasting licence fee () funded Radio France and France T√©l√©visions. People under the age of 21, under 25 and in full-time education, and those who had a household income below a certain threshold were exempt from the fee. The fee was abolished in 2022 and replaced with direct funding from the French Treasury.

===Gibraltar===
Until 2006 television licence fees provided funds to the Gibraltar Broadcasting Corporation (GBC). The licence fee was scrapped due to the low amount of fees. Even before the abolition of the licence fee, the majority of GBC&#x27;s funding came as a grant from the government.

===Hungary===
In Hungary, licence fees nominally exist, but since 2002 residential fees have been paid from the state budget. This means that funding for Magyar Telev√≠zi√≥ and Duna TV comes directly from taxation. Commercial venues such as hotels and bars also had their fees paid between 2002 and 2007, but since then they have needed to make a payment per television set.

Ever since privatisation in 1995, the public broadcaster MTV has had persistent financial difficulties. During the 2009 financial crisis, parliament cut their funding by more than 30 per cent, a move that was publicly condemned by the EBU.

===Hong Kong===
Hong Kong previously had a radio and television licence fee for Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) and Rediffusion Television, costing 36 Hong Kong dollars per year. RTHK is now funded by the Hong Kong Government.

===Iceland===
The television licence fee for Iceland&#x27;s state broadcaster R√öV was abolished in 2007 and replaced with a poll tax of 17,200 kr. from everyone who pays income tax, regardless of whether they use television and radio.

===India===
India introduced a radio receiver licence system in 1928 for All India Radio (AIR) Akashvani. Television licensing began in 1956‚Äì57. In 1976, public television was separated from AIR as a separate company, Doordarshan. In the 1970s and 1980s, radio licences cost Rs 15 per year and television licences cost Rs 50. The wireless licence inspector from the post office was authorized to check every house and shop for a Wireless License Book, and to issue penalties or seize the receiving equipment for non-payment. In 1984, the licensing system was withdrawn. AIR and Doordarshan are both funded by the Government of India and by income from advertising.

===Indonesia===
A radio tax for RRI funding was introduced in 1947, during the Indonesian National Revolution. The television fee was introduced soon after TVRI started broadcasting in 1962. The radio tax was abolished in the 1980s. The television fee continued into the 1990s. Its abolition started after public protests about the company that collected the fee, which was run by the Indonesian President&#x27;s son, but areas such as Bandung and Surabaya continued to have a television fee throughout the 1990s. A &quot;broadcasting fee&quot; () was included in legislation in 2002 but has not been implemented. Public radio and television are currently funded through a combination of advertising and funds from the state budget.

===Israel===
Licence fees were the primary source of revenue for the Israel Broadcasting Authority when it was the state broadcaster. Every household was charged ‚Ç™ 345 (‚Ç¨73) for a television licence and car owners were charged ‚Ç™ 136 (‚Ç¨29) for a radio licence. The television licence was abolished in 2015, but a radio licence is still required of car owners. The Israel Broadcasting Authority was replaced by the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation in May 2017. Its radio stations carry advertising and some of its television programmes are sponsored by commercial entities.

=== Liechtenstein ===
An annual licence was required between 1978 and 1998 for households with broadcast receiving equipment. The income was divided between PTT and the Swiss national broadcaster, SRG. Since 1998, an annual government grant for public media is administrated by the Mediakommision.

The sole radio station in the principality, Radio Liechtenstein, was founded as a private commercial music station in 1995. It was nationalised in 2004 under to create a domestic public broadcasting station. It is funded by commercials and the public broadcasting grant.

===Malaysia===
The annual television licence fee for television in 1990 was at RM 24, previously RM 36 in 1986 and RM 12 in 1985, while the radio licence fee in 1990 was at RM 12; unchanged since the 1960s. The licence fee for the former was also the lowest in the world as of 1989. The licence fee for monochrome televisions in 1985 was at RM 24.

Licences for home-use radios were abolished by late 1985 with the amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1960, while radio licences were abolished on 1 January 1991, due to Malaysia&#x27;s improved economic performance.

46.5% of television owners did not pay for the television licence in 1995.

In 1995, the government had planned to introduce pre-payment of television licence fees for people who have purchased a new television once every ten years, amounting RM 240 for each, replacing the annual payment which caused the government to lose millions of ringgit every year.

The government planned to add a separate licence for cable and satellite television owners and an increase of television licence fee for such users in 1996; it also had planned to increase the television licence fee to RM 36 in 1998.

The television licence fees were abolished in April 1999; however people still paid for the fees. The government decided to refund the fees that amounted to RM 67 million, becoming just RM 21 million in 2000.

Until April 2000, Malaysia had an annual television licence fee of MYR 24 (MYR 2 per month), one of the lowest television licence fees in the world. Now, RTM is funded by the government and advertising.

===Malta===
The licence fee in Malta funded Television Malta (TVM), and the radio stations Radio Malta and Radju Parliament run by Public Broadcasting Services. Approximately two-thirds of TVM&#x27;s funding came from the licence fee, with much of the remainder coming from commercials. Malta&#x27;s television licence was abolished in 2011 when the free-to-air system was discontinued.

=== Netherlands ===
Advertising on public television and radio started in 1967 but was tightly regulated. Initially there was only a small advertising segment before and after news broadcasts. In the late 1980s, commercial breaks of 1 to 3 minutes were allowed between programmes. Advertising on Sundays was not permitted until 1991.
Due to excessive collection costs, the fee was abolished around 2000. Income tax was increased and the maximum duration of commercial breaks was extended to 5 and 7¬†minutes. The Netherlands Public Broadcasting is now funded by government subsidy and advertising. The amount of time used by commercial breaks may not exceed 15 per cent of daily broadcasting time or 10 per cent of total annual broadcasting time.

===New Zealand===
Licence fees were first used in New Zealand to fund the radio services of what was to become the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation. Television was introduced in 1960 and with it the television licence fee, later known as the public broadcasting fee. This was capped at NZ$100 a year in the 1970s, and the country&#x27;s two television channels, while still publicly owned, became increasingly reliant on advertising. From 1989, it was collected and disbursed by the Broadcasting Commission (NZ On Air) on a contestable basis to support local content production. The public broadcasting fee was abolished in July 1999. NZ On Air was then funded by a direct appropriation from the Ministry for Culture and Heritage.

=== North Macedonia ===
The licence fee in the Republic of North Macedonia was around ‚Ç¨26 per year. Until 2005 it was collected monthly as part of the electricity bill. From November 2005, Macedonian Radio-Television (MRT) collected the fee until this responsibility was taken over by the Public Revenue Office. The fee was paid per household, with exemptions for households not covered by a broadcasting signal, and households of people with severe vision or hearing impairment. Hotels and motels were charged one broadcasting fee for every five rooms, legal persons and office space owners paid for one broadcasting fee for each 20 employees or other users of the office space, and owners of catering and other public facilities paid per television set. MRT also received income from advertising and sponsorship.

In January 2017, the licence fee was abolished. MRT, Macedonian Broadcasting and the Agency for Audio and Audiovisual Media Services are now financed directly from the Budget of the Republic of North Macedonia.

===Norway===

The licence fee in Norway was abolished in January 2020. Before that, every household with a television needed to pay a fee of 3000 kr (c. ‚Ç¨305). The fee was charged per household. People in a house who had a separate television and were not in the parental care of the householders needed to pay a separate licence fee. 
The fee was the primary source of income for Norsk Rikskringkasting (NRK). Since 2020, funding for NRK comes through taxation from each individual liable for income taxes in Norway.

===Romania===
Until 2017 a licence fee was collected as part of the electricity bill. It made up part of Televiziunea Rom√¢nƒÉ&#x27;s (TVR) funding, with the rest coming from advertising and government grants. Everyone with a television receiver or a computer needed to pay.
In 2016, the Parliament of Romania decided to abolish the fee from 1 January 2017. Since then, TVR&#x27;s funding mainly comes from government grants and advertising.

===Singapore===
Residents of Singapore with televisions in their households, or televisions or radios in their vehicles, were required to acquire the appropriate licences from 1963 to 2010. The licence fee in 1963 was at $24 per year ($2 per month), touted at the time as being &quot;one of the cheapest in this part of the world&quot;. The licence fees are channelled to the Singapore Broadcasting Authority where they would be used to fund minority and public service programmes.

As of 1991, the licence fee was at $100 per year.

The licence fees were abolished from 1 January 2011. Then Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam reported that he was abolishing the fees as they were &quot;losing their relevance&quot;.

===Slovakia===
The TV licence fee in Slovakia was ‚Ç¨4.64 per month (‚Ç¨55.68 per year). In addition to the licence fee, RTVS also received state subsidies and money from advertising. The license fee was abolished from 1 July 2023.

=== Soviet Union ===
Until 1961, all radio and television receivers in the Soviet Union were required to be registered in local telecommunication offices and a subscription fee was to be paid monthly. Compulsory registration and subscription fees were abolished on 18 August 1961, with prices of radio and television receivers raised to compensate for the lost fees.

=== Sweden ===

On 1 January 2019, the television licence (, literally &quot;TV fee&quot;) in Sweden was scrapped and replaced by a &quot;general public service fee&quot; (), which is a flat income-based public broadcasting tax of 1 per cent, capped at (approximately or ) per person per year. The fee is administered by the Swedish Tax Agency (), on behalf of the country&#x27;s three public broadcasters Sveriges Television (SVT), Sveriges Radio (SR) and Sveriges Utbildningsradio (UR). The fee pays for 5 television channels, 45 radio channels, and online television and radio.

Previously the television licence was a household-based flat fee. Originally it was referred as the &quot;television licence&quot; (), but in the 2000s was renamed &quot;television fee&quot;. It was last charged in 2018 at per annum. It was payable in monthly, bimonthly, quarterly or annual instalments, to the agency Radiotj√§nst i Kiruna, which was jointly owned by SVT, SR and UR. The fee was collected by every household or company containing a television set, and possession of such a device had to be reported to Radiotj√§nst by law. One fee was collected per household regardless of the number of television sets in the home or at other locations owned by the household, such as summer houses. Although the fee also paid for radio broadcasting, there was no specific fee for radios since the radio licence was abolished in 1978. Television licence evasion was suspected to be around 11 to 15 per cent.

===Taiwan===

Between 1959 and the 1970s, all radio and TV receivers in Taiwan were required to have a licence with an annual fee of NT$60. This was to prevent influence from mainland China&#x27;s (the People&#x27;s Republic of China) channels.

=== Thailand ===
The Radio Broadcasting and Television Act, B.E. 2498 (1955) set a lifetime licence fee of 200 baht (equivalent to baht in ) for ownership of radio and television sets or parts. It was abolished in 1959 as television and radio quickly became a vital source of information.

==Countries that have never had a television or broadcasting licence==
===Andorra===
R√†dio i Televisi√≥ d&#x27;Andorra, the public broadcaster, is funded by advertising and government grants with no fee for viewers.

===Brazil===
The federal company Empresa Brasil de Comunica√ß√£o, which manages TV Brasil and public radio stations (R√°dio MEC and R√°dio Nacional), is financed from the Federal Budget, besides profit from licensing and production of programs, institutional advertisement, and service rendering to public and private institutions.

The Padre Anchieta Foundation, which manages TV Cultura and the Cultura FM and Cultura Brasil radio stations in S√£o Paulo, receives funds from the state government, advertisements and fundraising from the private sector. In December 1997, the &quot;Education and Culture Tax&quot;, a state tax in S√£o Paulo, was instituted to fund the state&#x27;s public broadcasters, TV Cultura and R√°dio Cultura. The tax was charged monthly through electricity bills according to consumers&#x27; energy consumption. However, the collection of the fee was declared unconstitutional by the Court of Justice of the State of S√£o Paulo.

=== Chile ===
The state-owned Chilean television broadcaster, Televisi√≥n Nacional de Chile (TVN), founded in 1969, is financed by advertising, which can air between programs. Its autonomous financing allows the corporation to have economic independence from the State of Chile, being able to fully retain and take advantage of its annual profits only if the director in charge can esteem that way, as if it were a private company; however, TVN by a 1992 law cannot receive state financing under any circumstance. Its educational subchannel, NTV, is instead state-financed through a unique provision of funds courtesy of the Finance Ministry of Chile, and therefore cannot air advertisements, as well as have any commercial links.

===China===
The current state broadcaster, China Central Television (CCTV), established in 1958, is funded almost entirely through the sale of commercial advertising time, although this is supplemented by government funding and a tax of ¬•2 per month from all cable television subscribers in the country.

=== Estonia ===
In Estonia there are three public TV channels: Eesti Televisioon ETV, ETV2, and ETV+ (ETV+ was launched on 27 September 2015 and mostly targets people who speak Russian). The funding comes from government grant-in-aid. ETV is currently one of only a few public television broadcasters in the European Union which has neither advertising nor a licence fee and is solely funded by national government grants. Commercials in public broadcasting television were stopped in 2002 over concerns that its low prices were damaging the ability of commercial broadcasters to operate. The introduction of a licence fee system was considered but ultimately rejected in the face of public opposition.

=== Iran ===
Iran has never levied television licence fees. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, National Iranian Radio and Television was renamed Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, and became the state broadcaster. In Iran, private broadcasting is illegal.

=== Latvia ===
Public Broadcasting of Latvia is a consortium of the public radio broadcaster Latvijas Radio and the public TV broadcaster Latvijas Televƒ´zija, which operates the LTV1 and LTV7 channels. After years of debate, the public broadcasters ceased airing commercial advertising from January 1, 2021, and became fully government-funded by the national budget. The introduction of a television licence has been previously debated, but this was opposed by the government.

===Luxembourg===
Luxembourg has never had a television licence requirement. Until 1993, it had no national public broadcaster, and it still has no public television broadcaster.

Radio 100,7 is a radio station funded by the country&#x27;s Ministry of Culture and by sponsorship arrangements. Television in Luxembourg is provided by the commercial network RTL T√©l√© L√´tzebuerg and channels serving nearby countries.

===Monaco===
Monaco has never had any listener or viewer broadcasting licence fee. Since the establishment of Radio Monte-Carlo in 1943 and T√©l√©vision Monte-Carlo in 1954, both have been funded on a commercial basis with no charge for the audience.

===Nigeria===
Television licences are not used in Nigeria, except in the sense of &quot;broadcasting licences&quot; granted to private networks. The federal government&#x27;s television station, NTA (Nigerian Television Authority), has two broadcast networks: NTA 1 is partly funded by central government and partly by advertising revenue, and NTA 2 is wholly funded by advertisements. Almost all thirty-six states have their own television stations, funded wholly or substantially by their respective governments.

=== Philippines ===
Television licensing has never been enacted in the Philippines. The state-owned television (PTV and IBC) and radio (PBS) stations have been funded directly by the government&#x27;s annual budget and by advertising.

===Post-Soviet states===
See #Soviet Union.

=== Spain ===
Spanish national public broadcasters had been funded by government grants and advertising income since (RNE) radio service was launched in 1937 and (TVE) television service was launched in 1956. Although RNE removed advertising in 1986, TVE continued broadcasting commercials until 2009. Since 2010, Radiotelevisi√≥n Espa√±ola (RTVE) ‚Äìthe corporation that absorbed the management of RNE and TVE in 2007‚Äì is funded by government grants and taxes paid by private nationwide television broadcasters and telecommunications companies.

=== United States ===
In the United States, privately owned commercial radio and television stations funded by advertising proved to be commercially viable. Some governments owned non-commercial radio stations (such as WNYC, owned by New York City from 1922 to 1997) or educational television stations, but most broadcasters were private companies or were owned by charitable organizations supported by donations.

The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) was created by the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, and this led to the creation of the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR). These are loose networks of non-commercial educational (NCE) stations owned by state and local governments, educational institutions, and non-profit organizations. They are more similar to U.S. commercial networks than European public broadcasters.

Annual funding for public television in the United States was US$445.5¬†million in 2014 (including interest revenue). The CPB, and virtually all government-owned stations, are funded through general taxes, donations from individuals (usually in the form of &quot;memberships&quot;), and charitable organizations. Individual programs on public broadcasters may be supported by underwriting spots paid for by sponsors. Between 53 and 60 percent of public television&#x27;s revenues come from private membership donations and grants, so most stations solicit individual donations by fundraising, pledge drives or telethons which can disrupt regularly scheduled programming. Normal programming can be replaced with specials aimed at a wider audience to solicit new members and donations.

In some rural areas of the United States, broadcast translator districts exist, which are funded by an ad valorem property tax on all property within the district, or by a parcel tax on each dwelling unit within the district. Failure to pay the TV translator tax has the same repercussions as failing to pay any other property tax, including a lien placed on the property and eventual seizure. In addition, fines can be levied on viewers who watch TV from the translator signals without paying the fee. As the Federal Communications Commission has exclusive jurisdiction over broadcast stations, whether a local authority can legally impose a fee merely to watch an over-the-air broadcast station is questionable. In some areas the tax is charged regardless of whether the resident watches TV from the translator. In other areas the property owner may certify that they do not use the translator district&#x27;s services and get a waiver.

Cable television franchise fee agreements are added to cable TV bills to fund public, educational, and government access (PEG) television for the municipality that granted the franchise agreement. State governments may also add taxes. These taxes generate controversy since they sometimes go into the general taxation fund, or there is &quot;double taxation&quot; where public-access television is paid for by taxes but the cable television operator has to pay for equipment or facilities, or has to pay for local municipality projects that are not related to television.

=== Uruguay ===
Uruguay does not have a fee or TV licence. The two public broadcasters in the country, Canal 5 and RNU, are funded by government grants.

=== Vietnam ===
Vietnam has never had a television licence fee. Advertising was introduced in the early 1990s as a way to generate revenue for television stations. The current state broadcaster, Vietnam Television, receives the majority of its funds through advertising and some from government subsidies. Local television stations in Vietnam are operated in a similar way.

== Detection of television licence evasion ==

In many jurisdictions, television licences are enforced. Detection of illegal television sets can be as simple as observing the lights and sounds of a television used in a property without a licence.

Television detector vans have been employed by TV Licensing in the United Kingdom, with various detection techniques reported. 
An effort to compel the BBC to release key information about the television detection equipment under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 was rejected. The BBC stated, &quot;Detection equipment is complex to deploy as its use is strictly governed by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (British Broadcasting Corporation) Order 2001. RIPA and the Order outline how relevant investigatory powers are to be used by the BBC and ensure compliance with human rights.&quot;
The BBC resisted further Freedom of Information Act requests seeking data on the estimated evasion rate for each of the nations of the UK.

==Opinions of television licensing systems==
Advocates argue that a main advantage of television fully funded by a licence fee is that programming can be enjoyed without interruptions for advertisements. Europeans tend to watch television for one hour less per day than North Americans, but because of differences in advertising may be enjoying the same amount of television content in that shorter time. 
Television funded by advertising is not truly free of cost to consumers as the cost of advertising is passed on in the price of products.

Critics of receiver licensing point out that a licence is a regressive form of taxation. In contrast, costs from advertising are paid proportion to the consumption of advertised goods. The experience with broadcast deregulation in Europe suggests that demand for commercial-free content is not as high as once thought.

In 2004, the UK government&#x27;s Department for Culture, Media and Sport asked the public what it thought of various funding alternatives. Fifty-nine per cent of respondents agreed with the statement &quot;Advertising would interfere with my enjoyment of programmes&quot;, while 31 per cent disagreed. 71 per cent agreed with the statement &quot;subscription funding would be unfair to those that could not pay&quot;, while 16 per cent disagreed. An independent study showed that more than two-thirds of people polled thought that the licence fee should be dropped due to other subscription television services. The Department concluded that the licence fee was &quot;the least worse option&quot;, 
and in 2005 the British government described the licence fee system as &quot;the best (and most widely supported) funding model, even though it is not perfect&quot;.

In 2018 there was a referendum in Switzerland on whether TV licensing should be scrapped, in which voters rejected abolition by 71.6 per cent to 28.4 per cent. Legislators in Bulgaria have attempted to introduce a television licence. In Bulgaria, a fee is specified in the broadcasting law but has never been implemented. Lithuania and Latvia have debated the introduction of a licence fee but have not legislated for one. In the case of Latvia, some analysts believe this is partly because the government is unwilling to relinquish control of Latvijas Televƒ´zija, which it gains from directly funding the service.

The Czech Republic increased the proportion of funding that the public broadcaster gets from licence fees, justifying the move with the argument that the existing public service broadcasters cannot compete with commercial broadcasters for advertising revenues.

== Internet-based broadcast access ==
The Internet allows television and radio programmes to be easily accessed outside their country of origin. Where national broadcasters have streaming services, there would be no technological difficulties in accessing these programmes internationally. However, countries with TV licensing systems often do not have a way for potential international viewers to pay for a licence. Instead, they work to prevent international access because licensing rules have not adapted to the possible global audience.

<text>Irvine Welsh (born 27 September 1958) is a Scottish novelist and short story writer. His 1993 novel &quot;Trainspotting&quot; was made into a film of the same name. He has also written plays and screenplays, and directed several short films.

==Early life==
Irvine Welsh was born in Leith, the port area of the Scottish capital Edinburgh. He states that he was born in 1958, though according to Glasgow police, his birth record is dated around 1951. When he was four, his family moved to Muirhouse, in Edinburgh, where they stayed in local housing schemes. His mother worked as a waitress. His father was a dock worker in Leith until bad health forced him to stop, after which he became a carpet salesman; he died when Welsh was 25. Welsh left Ainslie Park High School when he was 16 and then completed a City and Guilds course in electrical engineering. He became an apprentice TV repairman until an electric shock persuaded him to move on to a series of other jobs. He left Edinburgh for the London punk scene in 1978, where he played guitar and sang in The Pubic Lice and Stairway 13. A series of arrests for petty crimes and finally a suspended sentence for trashing a North London community centre inspired Welsh to correct his ways. He worked for Hackney Council in London and studied computing with the support of the Manpower Services Commission.

Welsh returned to Edinburgh in the late 1980s, where he worked for the city council in the housing department. He then studied for an MBA at Heriot-Watt University.

==Fiction==

Welsh has published eleven novels and four collections of short stories. His first novel, &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, was published in 1993. Set in the mid-1980s, it uses a series of non-linear and loosely connected short-stories to tell the story of a group of characters tied together by decaying friendships, heroin addiction and stabs at escape from the oppressive boredom and brutality of their lives in the social housing schemes. It was released to shock and outrage in some circles and great acclaim in others. It was adapted as a play, and a film adaptation, directed by Danny Boyle and written by John Hodge, was released in 1996. Welsh appeared in the film in the minor role of drug dealer Mikey Forrester.

Next, Welsh released &quot;The Acid House&quot;, a collection of short stories from &quot;Rebel Inc.&quot;, &quot;New Writing Scotland&quot; and other sources. Many of the stories take place in and around the housing schemes from &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, and employ many of the same themes; a touch of fantasy is apparent in stories such as &quot;The Acid House&quot;, where the minds of a baby and a drug user swap bodies, or &quot;The Granton Star Cause&quot;, where God transforms a man into a fly as punishment for wasting his life. Welsh adapted three of the stories for a later film of the same name, in which he also appeared.

Welsh&#x27;s third book (and second novel), &quot;Marabou Stork Nightmares&quot;, alternates between a grim tale of thugs and schemes in sub-working class Scotland and a hallucinatory adventure tale set in South Africa.

His next book, &quot;&quot; (1996), became his most high-profile work since &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, released in the wave of publicity surrounding the film. It consists of three unconnected novellas: the first, &quot;Lorraine Goes To Livingston&quot;, is a bawdy satire of classic British romance novels, the second, &quot;Fortune&#x27;s Always Hiding&quot;, is a revenge story involving thalidomide and the third, &quot;The Undefeated&quot;, is a sly, subtle romance between a young woman dissatisfied with the confines of her suburban life and an aging clubgoer.

A corrupt police officer and his tapeworm served as the narrators for his third novel, &quot;Filth&quot; (1998). The main character of &quot;Filth&quot; was a vicious sociopathic policeman. The novel was adapted to a film of the same name in 2013.

&quot;Glue&quot; (2001) was a return to the locations, themes and episodic form of &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, telling the stories of four characters spanning several decades in their lives and the bonds that held them together.

Having revisited some of them in passing in &quot;Glue&quot;, Welsh brought most of the &quot;Trainspotting&quot; characters back for a sequel, &quot;Porno&quot;, in 2002. In this book Welsh explores the impact of pornography on the individuals involved in producing it, as well as society as a whole, and the impact of aging and maturity in individuals against their will. The book is set just after the opening of the new Scottish Parliament.

&quot;The Bedroom Secrets of the Master Chefs&quot; (2006), deals with a young, alcoholic civil servant who finds himself inadvertently putting a curse on his nemesis, a nerdy co-worker. In 2007, Welsh published &quot;If You Liked School You&#x27;ll Love Work&quot;, his first collection of short stories in over a decade.

Welsh contributed a novella called &quot;Contamination&quot; to &quot;The Weekenders: Travels in the Heart of Africa&quot;. Welsh, Ian Rankin, and Alexander McCall Smith each contributed a short story for the &quot;One City&quot; compilation published in 2005 in benefit of the One City Trust for social inclusion in Edinburgh. In &quot;Crime&quot;, Ray Lennox (from Welsh&#x27;s previous work, &quot;Filth&quot;) is recovering from a mental breakdown induced by occupational stress and cocaine abuse, and a particularly horrifying child sex murder case back in Edinburgh. The story takes place in Florida. 

Welsh&#x27;s prequel to &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, titled &quot;Skagboys&quot;, was published in 2012. Set in Leith in the early 1980s, it introduces the &quot;Trainspotting&quot; characters and follows them as they fall into heroin addiction. Given as a series of linked short stories, the book is also interspersed with brief commentaries on contemporary British politics. In particular, the consequences of the destruction of industry in the northern cities are drawn for the young working class. His eighth novel, &quot;The Sex Lives of Siamese Twins&quot;, was published in May 2014 and his ninth novel titled &quot;A Decent Ride&quot; was published by Vintage Books in April 2015. The latter work featured the returning character &#x27;Juice&#x27; Terry Lawson (previously from &quot;Glue&quot;).

Welsh&#x27;s tenth novel, released in April 2016, &quot;The Blade Artist&quot;, centres around a seemingly rehabilitated Francis Begbie now living in California with a wife and children. It was shortlisted for the Fiction Book of the Year at Saltire Literary Awards 2016.

A sequel to &quot;The Blade Artist&quot;, entitled &quot;Dead Men&#x27;s Trousers&quot;, was released on 29 March 2018, and sees Mark Renton, Sick Boy, and Spud reuniting with Francis Begbie.

In 2021, a TV adaptation of &quot;Crime&quot; was launched in the UK on BritBox as a six-episode series starring Dougray Scott as detective Lennox. Welsh worked on the project with Dean Cavanagh. This was the first TV adaptation of a book by Welsh. A second six-episode series has since been made and is currently available on ITV and ITVX.

==Film and stage==
As well as fiction, Irvine Welsh has written several stage plays, including &quot;Headstate&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ll Have Had Your Hole&quot;, and the musical &quot;Blackpool&quot;, which featured original songs by Vic Godard of the Subway Sect.

He co-authored &quot;Babylon Heights&quot; with his screen writing partner Dean Cavanagh. The play premiered in San Francisco at the Exit Theatre and made its European premi√®re in Dublin, at The Mill Theatre Dundrum, directed by Graham Cantwell. The plot revolves around the behind-the-scenes antics of a group of Munchkins on the set of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. The production included the use of oversized sets with actors of regular stature.

Cavanagh and Welsh have also collaborated on screenplays. &quot;The Meat Trade&quot; is based on the 19th-century West Port murders. Despite the historical source material, Welsh has set the story in the familiar confines of present-day Edinburgh, with Burke and Hare depicted as brothers who steal human organs to meet the demands of the global transplant market.

&quot;Wedding Belles&quot;, a film made for Channel 4 that was written by Welsh and Cavanagh, aired at the end of March 2007. The film centres around the lives of four young women, who are played by Michelle Gomez, Shirley Henderson, Shauna MacDonald, and Kathleen McDermot. &quot;Wedding Belles&quot; was nominated for a Scottish BAFTA and was subsequently sold to TV channels in Canada and Europe.

Welsh has directed several short films for bands. In 2001 he directed a 15-minute film for Gene&#x27;s song &quot;Is It Over&quot; which is taken from the album &quot;Libertine&quot;. In 2006 he directed a short film to accompany the track &quot;Atlantic&quot; from Keane&#x27;s album &quot;Under the Iron Sea&quot;.

Welsh directed his first short dramatic film, &quot;NUTS&quot;, which he co-wrote with Cavanagh. The film features Joe McKinney as a man dealing with testicular cancer in post Celtic tiger Ireland. It was released in 2007.

Welsh co-directed &quot;The Right to liberty&quot;, a chapter of the documentary film &quot;The New Ten Commandments&quot;, in 2008.

In 2009 Welsh directed the film &quot;Good Arrows&quot; (co-directed by Helen Grace). It was written by Welsh and Cavanagh. The film is about a darts player who suffers from depression which causes him to lose his skill.

==Themes==
As well as recreational drug use, Welsh&#x27;s fiction and non-fiction is dominated by the question of working class and Scottish identity in the period spanning the 1960s to the present day. Within this, he explores the rise and fall of the council housing scheme, denial of opportunity, low-paid work, unemployment, social assistance, sectarianism, football, hooliganism, sex, suppressed homosexuality, dance clubs, freemasonry, Irish republicanism, sodomy, class divisions, emigration and, perhaps most of all, the humour, prejudices and axioms of the Scots.

Sam Leith, writing in the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, argues that: &quot;Welsh&#x27;s concerns are with sin and salvation, with the exercise of free will and with the individual soul. He&#x27;s much more interested in teleology than sociology.&quot;

==Style==
Welsh&#x27;s novels share characters, giving the feel of a &quot;shared universe&quot; within his writing. For example, characters from &quot;Trainspotting&quot; make cameo appearances in &quot;The Acid House&quot;, &quot;Marabou Stork Nightmares&quot;, &quot;Ecstasy&quot;, &quot;Filth&quot;, and slightly larger appearances in &quot;Glue&quot;, whose characters then appear in &quot;Porno&quot;.

Welsh is known for writing in his native Edinburgh dialect of Scots. He generally ignores the traditional conventions of literary Scots, used for example by Allan Ramsay, Robert Fergusson, Robert Burns, Robert Louis Stevenson, and James Orr. Instead, he transcribes dialects phonetically.

Like Alasdair Gray before him, Welsh also experiments with typography. In the novel &quot;Filth&quot;, the tapeworm&#x27;s internal monologue is imposed over the top of the protagonist&#x27;s own internal monologue (the worm&#x27;s host), visibly depicting the tapeworm&#x27;s voracious appetite, much like the &quot;Climax of Voices&quot; in Gray&#x27;s novel &quot;1982, Janine&quot;.

==Personal life==
Welsh married Beth Quinn in 2005. They were later divorced in 2018. They had lived together in the Lakeview neighbourhood of Chicago, USA, since 2009. Prior to Chicago, he lived in Dublin. In 2018, he was living in Miami, USA.

In 2022, he married Emma Currie, an actor and sister of Scottish musician Momus.

In Welsh&#x27;s early 20s, he was addicted to heroin for 18 months while playing in punk-rock bands moving between Edinburgh and London.

Welsh is an avid supporter of Hibernian F.C. and of Scottish independence.

<text>This is a list of chess variants. Many thousands of variants exist. The 2007 catalogue &quot;The Encyclopedia of Chess Variants&quot; estimates that there are well over 2,000, and many more were considered too trivial for inclusion in the catalogue. 
== Contemporary chess variants ==

The chess variants listed below are derived from chess by changing one or more of the many rules of the game. The rules can be grouped into categories, from the most innocuous (starting position) to the most dramatic (adding chance/randomness to the gameplay after the initial piece placement). If a variant changes rules from multiple categories, it belongs to the sub-section below corresponding to the later-listed category.
* Starting position and armies
* Piece types
* Midgame rules and end-of-game rules
* Board shape
* Number of players
* Use of hidden information or chance

Names that represent a set of variants are annotated with &quot;[multivariant]&quot; after their name. All variants use an 8x8 board unless otherwise specified.

=== Variant starting position (rectangular board, standard piece types and rules) ===
Many variants employ standard chess rules and mechanics, but vary the number of pieces, or their starting positions. In most such variants, the pawns are placed on their usual squares, but the position of other pieces is either randomly determined or selected by the players. The motivation for these variants is usually to nullify established opening knowledge. The downside of these variants is that the initial position usually has less harmony and balance than the standard chess position.
==== Fixed positions ====
* Active chess: Played on a 9√ó8 board, adding a queen with an extra pawn in front. Invented by G. Kuzmichov (1989), whose students tested the game, deciding that the optimal starting position was to place the second queen on the eighth or ninth files.
* Displacement chess [multivariant]: Some pieces in the initial position are exchanged but the rules remain exactly the same. Some examples of this may be that the king and queen are flipped, or the knight on the b-file is traded with the bishop on the f-file.

* Double chess: Two full armies per side on a 12√ó16 board, the first to mate an enemy king wins. Pawns advance up to four steps on their first move. Capablanca found the game &quot;remarkably interesting&quot;. Invented by Julian Hayward (1916).
* Endgame chess (or the Pawns Game, with unknown origins): Players start the game with only pawns and a king. Normal check, checkmate, &quot;en passant&quot;, and pawn promotion rules apply.
* Los Alamos chess (or anti-clerical chess): Played on a 6√ó6 board without bishops. This was the first chess-like game played by a computer program.
* Upside-down chess: The white and black pieces are switched so that White&#x27;s pieces are on the 8th rank, with pawns on the 7th rank, one step away from promotion. The starting position looks like a standard chess starting position, but from the other player&#x27;s perspective. As the pawns are blocked by pieces in the starting position, the game always starts with a knight move, and smothered mates are common.

==== Player-chosen positions ====
* Casablanca chess: The starting position is chosen from a famous historic game; usually an interesting middlegame position. The position is verified to be approximately equal by a computer, and should have winning chances for both sides. The first Casablanca chess tournament was played in May 2024, and won by Magnus Carlsen.
* Pre-chess: The game starts with white and black pawns set as usual, but the initial position of other pieces is selected by the players. White first places one of their pieces on their first rank, and then Black does the same. Players continue to alternate in this manner until all pieces have been placed, with the only restriction being that bishops must be on opposite-colour squares. The game then proceeds in the usual way. Proposed by Pal Benko in 1978.
* Polgar reform chess [multivariant]: In his book &quot;Reform-Chess&quot; (1997), L√°szl√≥ Polg√°r proposed several variants played on board of size 5√ó8, 6√ó8, 8√ó6, or 9√ó6. The initial piece setup is determined by players in the same way as in Benko&#x27;s Pre-chess. There are special rules for castling depending on the board. Polg√°r recommended these variants to train creativity and to speed up the game.

==== Random positions ====

* Fischer Random Chess (or Chess960): The placement of the pieces on the first rank is randomized; although there are rules such as the 2 starting Bishops have to be on different colour squares, and the King has to start between the 2 Rooks. The opponent&#x27;s pieces mirror it. Invented by Bobby Fischer (1996).
* Transcendental Chess: Similar to Chess960, but the opening white and black positions do not mirror each other.

==== Unequal armies ====
In these variants, White and Black do not necessarily begin with the same quantities of each piece type (for example, White may begin with more pawns than Black).
* Dunsany&#x27;s Chess (and the similar Horde chess): One side has standard chess pieces, and the other side has 32 pawns.
* Handicap chess (or Chess with odds) [multivariant]: Variations to equalise chances of players with different strength.
* Peasants&#x27; Revolt: White has a king and eight pawns (the peasants) against Black&#x27;s king, pawn, and four knights (the nobles). Black has the advantage. To narrow the contest, the game has also been played with three knights (on b8, c8, and g8) instead of four. By R. L. Frey (1947).
* Sixteen Pawns: White plays without their queen, but chooses where on the third and fourth ranks to place eight extra pawns. By Legall de Kermeur (18th century). Alexandre Deschapelles and Louis-Charles Mah√© de La Bourdonnais later established that eight extra pawns favour White too much, and hence played the game with only five, six, or seven extra pawns for White instead.
* Really Bad Chess: A mobile video game by Zach Gage; Each player has one king and fifteen other pieces selected at random. 
* Weak!: White has the usual pieces, Black has one king, seven knights, and sixteen pawns. This game was played at a Columbia University chess club in the 1960s.

=== Variants with fairy chess pieces ===


==== Variants with fairy pieces on a standard board ====
Most of the pieces in these variants are borrowed from chess. The game goal and rules are also very similar to those in chess; however, these variants include one or more fairy pieces which move differently from chess pieces.
* Baroque chess (or Ultima): Pieces on the first row move like queens, and pieces on the second row move like rooks. They are named after their unusual capturing methods. For example, leaper, immobilizer and coordinator.
* Berolina chess: All pawns are replaced with Berolina pawns, that move diagonally and capture orthogonally.
* Chess with different armies: Two sides use different sets of fairy pieces. There are several armies of approximately equal strength to choose from including the standard FIDE chess army.
* Falcon-Hunter Chess: A falcon moves forward as a bishop; backward as a rook. The hunter moves forward as a rook; backward as a bishop. Players introduce the fairies as the game progresses. By Karl Schulz (1943).
* Grasshopper chess [multivariant]: The pawns can promote to grasshopper, or grasshoppers are on the board in the initial position.
* Pocket Mutation Chess: Player can put a piece temporarily into the pocket, optionally mutating it into another (including fairy) piece.
* Spartan chess: Black (the Spartans) has an army headed by two kings, which otherwise consists exclusively of non-standard pieces, and battles the standard FIDE army (the Persians) of white.
*Super X Chess: Players can combine their own pieces by capturing them. King or queen can&#x27;t combine. A combined piece has the ability to move as both pieces that got combined. Same kind of pieces can combine into new pieces. Pieces can&#x27;t uncombine or combine again. By Miika Pihkala (2018).
* Torpedo chess: Pawns are replaced with torpedo pawns, which can move two squares forwards anywhere on the board as opposed to only on the first move. Pawns that move two squares can be captured &quot;en passant&quot; on the very next move. The rest of the pieces remain unchanged.
* Way of the Knight (WOTN): Invented by Ralph Betza, incorporating two elements from tabletop role-playing games. Begins with the standard starting position and pieces, however through capturing and advancing up the board pieces can earn &quot;experience&quot;, and a sufficiently experienced piece is upgraded to a more powerful one. Upgrades include various fairy pieces, and involve player choices of &quot;alignment&quot;.

==== Variants with popular fairy pieces: Empress, Amazon, Princess ====
There are a number of variants which use the empress (rook + knight) and princess (bishop + knight) compound pieces. The empress is also called marshall or chancellor. The princess is also called cardinal, archbishop, janus, paladin, or minister. Another compound piece is the amazon (queen + knight). To adapt to the new pieces, the board is usually extended to 10√ó8 or 10√ó10 with additional pawns added.
* Almost Chess: Uses an 8√ó8 board, with the conventional starting position, but queens are replaced by chancellors (empresses). By Ralph Betza (1977). A related variant is Sort of Almost Chess (Ralph Betza, 1994), where one player has a queen and the other has a chancellor.

* Capablanca Chess: A variant by the former world chess champion, Jos√© Ra√∫l Capablanca. Played on a 10√ó8 board with chancellor (empress) and archbishop (princess).
* Capablanca Random Chess: Generalises all possible variants of Capablanca Chess with random starting positions following a method similar to that used in Chess960. By Reinhard Scharnagl (2004). 
* Embassy Chess: Uses a 10√ó8 board with Marshall (Empress) and Cardinal (Princess). The starting position is borrowed from Grand Chess. By Kevin Hill (2005).
*Gemini Chess: Uses a 10√ó8 board with two Archbishops. From an idea of Dr Zied Haddad in 2016. The difference from Janus Chess is the initial setup where the archbishops are sandwiching the queen and king remaining in the center of the board. 
* Gothic chess: A commercial variant played on a 10√ó8 board with Chancellor (Empress) and Archbishop (Princess).
* Grand Chess: Uses a 10√ó10 board with marshall (empress) and cardinal (princess). Invented by Christian Freeling (1984).
* Janus Chess: Uses a 10√ó8 board with two januses (princesses). By Werner Sch√∂ndorf (1978).
* Maharajah and the Sepoys: Black has a complete army, and White only one piece: the maharajah (a royal amazon).
* Modern Chess: Played on a 9√ó9 board, with an extra pawn and a prime minister (princess). By Gabriel Vicente Maura (1968).
*: A commercial variant, inspired from Seirawan Chess. This variant introduces 10 fairy pieces: archbishop, chancellor, hawk (different rules from Seirawan Chess), elephant (different rules from Seirawan Chess), leopard, cannon (different from Xiangqi), unicorn, fortress, spider, and amazon (also called dragon in this game). Players have a choice of 2 pieces among the 10 possible and method used to introduce them during the game.
* Seirawan Chess: A commercial variant. Uses a standard 8√ó8 board with elephant (empress) and hawk (princess). By GM Yasser Seirawan and Bruce Harper (2007).

==== Other variants with fairy pieces ====
* 2000 A.D.: Played on a 10√ó10 board, features the empress, capricorn, gorgon, chimaera, dragon, minotaur, unicorn, and fury fairy chess pieces. By V. R. Parton.
* Bear chess: 10x10 chess variant, proposed by Mikhail Sosnovsky in 1985 in Kalinin. Board 10x10; extra pieces are Bears, which leap as N or two squares as R or B; baseline (a1-j1/a10-j10) RNBBeQKBeBNR. Pawns can move up to three squares initially (e.p. permitted). In castling, K moves to c/h files.
* Chessers: There are multiple variants that combine the rules of chess and checkers, including a 1925 variant by Frank Maus, and a 1960 proprietary variant by Phillips Publishers, Inc.
* Chess on a really big board: Played on a 16x16 board with 6 nonstandard piece types. Invented by Ralph Betza.
* Decimal Chess [multivariant]: Played on a 10√ó10 board, usually add extra pieces. Some decimal chesses use only standard pieces, but others such as Decimal Falcon-Hunter Chess use fairy pieces. One such variant is Decimal Rettah chess, which adds a king, queen and two pawns. Invented by V. R. Parton. 
*Dragonchess: Three 8x12 boards with some standard chess pieces and many other pieces, some of which move between the levels. Created by Gary Gygax.
*Duell: Dice are used instead of pieces. Played on a 9√ó8 board.
* Etchessera: Played on a regular chessboard but where players build their own chess army from a collection of 17 different pieces.
*Gess: Chess with variable pieces, played on a Go board.
* Jetan: A &quot;Martian chess&quot; invented by Edgar Rice Burroughs for his novel &quot;The Chessmen of Mars&quot; (1922), played on a 10√ó10 board. None of the pieces are standard chess pieces.
* Prince &amp; Princess: The chess variant that uses the criterion of succession, where the king or queen are replaced in favor of the prince or the princess, created by Antonio Maravi Oyague.
* Proteus: A chess variant using dice to represent normal chess pieces, created by Steve Jackson Games.
* Shako: Played on a 10√ó10 board. New pieces are the cannon from xiangqi (Chinese chess) and an elephant moving as a fers+alfil of old shatranj (ancestors of queen and bishop), so diagonally one or two squares with jumps allowed. By Jean Louis-Cazaux (1997).
* Stealth chess: Played in the fictional Ankh-Morpork Assassins&#x27; Guild from the &quot;Discworld&quot; series of books; played on an 8√ó10 board. The fairy piece is the Assassin.
* Stratomic: Adds nuclear missiles to the standard chess array on a 10√ó10 board. When launched they irradiate any 3√ó3 area (friendly pieces included) except kings. By Robert Montay-Marsais (1972). 
* Wildebeest Chess: Uses an 11√ó10 board, each player has two camels and a wildebeest (camel + knight). Pawns move one, two, or three squares initially. By R. Wayne Schmittberger (1987). 
* Wolf Chess: On an 8√ó10 board, with fairy pieces wolf (empress), fox (princess), nightrider, sergeant (almost a Berolina pawn), and elephant (amazon). By Arno von Wilpert (1943).

=== Variant rules ===
These variants introduce changes in the mechanics of the game, such as movement of pieces, rules for capturing, or winning conditions.
==== Standard board ====
* 65th case: a 65th optional case is available adjacent to the board. Other rules remain the same.

==== Variant move counts ====
In these variants one or both players can move more than once per turn. The board and the pieces in these variants are the same as in standard chess.
* Avalanche chess: Each move consists of a standard chess move followed by a move of one of the opponent&#x27;s pawns.
* Double-Move Chess: Similar to Marseillais chess, but with no &quot;en passant&quot;, check, or checkmate. The objective is to capture the king. By Fred Galvin (1957).
* Double-Take Chess: Each player, once per game, can make two moves during one of their turns. These two moves cannot be used to place the opponent&#x27;s king in checkmate.
* Kung-fu chess: A variant without turns. Any player can move any of their pieces at any given moment.
* Marseillais chess (or Two-move chess): After the first turn of the game by White being a single move, each player moves twice per turn.
* Monster chess (or Super King): White has the king and four pawns (c2-f2) against the entire black army but may make two successive moves per turn. There is no check. Players win by capturing the king. In a variant, White&#x27;s pieces begin one row forward of their usual starting position, and the White&#x27;s pawns may not begin with a double step. Another variant denies Black promotion rights (pawns reaching the last rank remain as pawns). White may always promote.
*Multimove Chess (&quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;): A class of chess variants where white gets &quot;i&quot; moves per turn and black gets &quot;j&quot; moves per turn. Check is not enforced, and victory is by capturing the enemy king. The games are described and analysed logically in a 2015 journal article. The authors weakly solved the game for all (&quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;) pairs except for (1, 1) (functionally, regular chess) and (2, 2).
*Progressive chess (or Scottish chess): White moves once, then Black moves twice, then White moves three times, and so on.
* Swarm chess: During each turn, each piece that a player can move must be moved.

==== Other variant midgame rules ====
These variants feature variant rules in the middle of the game, but the end goal remains the same (to checkmate the enemy king).
* Absorption chess (also called cannibal chess, power absorption chess, or seizer&#x27;s chess): Pieces gain the abilities of the pieces they capture.
* Andernach chess: A piece making a capture changes colour.
* ASEAN chess: Pawns start on the 3rd ranks. Queens can only move 1 square diagonally and Bishops only 1 square diagonally or 1 square directly forward.
* Atomic chess: Capture on any square results in an &quot;atomic explosion&quot; which kills (i.e. removes from the game) all pieces in the eight surrounding squares, except for pawns.
* Benedict chess: Instead of capturing by displacement, players may convert an enemy piece they attack to their own color.
* Chad: Kings are limited to 3√ó3 &quot;castles&quot; on a 12√ó12 board dominated by eight rooks per side which can promote to queens. By Christian Freeling (1979).
* Checkers chess: Pieces can only move forward until they have reached the far rank.
* Checkless chess: Players are forbidden from giving check except to checkmate.
* Chessplus: Commercial variant. Up to two of any friendly piece save the King may occupy the same single square. Either piece may choose to carry the other with it if or when it moves.
* Circe chess: Captured pieces are reborn on their starting squares.
* Congo: Kings (lions) are limited to 3√ó3 &quot;castles&quot; on a 7√ó7 board. By Demian Freeling (1982). 
* Crazyhouse: Captured pieces change color to match the capturing player‚Äôs pieces and can be returned to any unoccupied square on a later turn. There are two variations of this variant, known as Loop Chess and Chessgi. 
* Cubic Chess: Piece cubes display the six piece types; a player can promote any pawn by rotating its cube to match a captured piece type. By Vladim√≠r Pribylinec (1977).
* Dragonfly: Played on a 7√ó7 or hex board, no queens, captured non-pawn pieces never die (√† la Chessgi) and can be dropped on any open square. By Christian Freeling.
* Dynamo Chess: Capturing is replaced by pushing or pulling enemy pieces off the board. By Hans Kl√ºver and Peter Kahl (1968). A close variant of Push Chess (by Fred Galvin, 1967).
* Einstein chess: Pieces transform into more or less powerful pieces when they move.
* Gravity chess: After every turn, all pieces other than pawns fall towards the higher ranks of the board, until they either reach the eighth rank, or another piece or pawn in the way.
* Grid chess: The board is overlaid with a grid of lines. For a move to be legal, it must cross at least one of these lines.
* Guard chess (or Icelandic chess): Allows captures only when a piece is completely unprotected by friendly pieces. Checkmate occurs when the piece forcing the mate is protected and therefore cannot be captured.
* Haft Schr√∂dinger Chess: Every piece starts in a quantum superposition initially able to be any piece until the waveform is collapsed by observation. As in chess, Haft Schr√∂dinger Chess does not have hidden information, whereas Schr√∂dinger&#x27;s Chess is regarded as a game of hidden information.
* Hierarchical chess: Pieces must be moved in the order: pawn, knight, bishop, rook, queen, king. A player who has the corresponding piece but cannot move it loses.
* Hostage chess: Captured pieces are held in the capturer&#x27;s &quot;prison&quot;, and can be released by the opponent and dropped into play (like shogi) via a &quot;hostage exchange&quot;. By John Leslie (1997). 
* Jedi Knight chess: Knights may move three steps diagonally or horizontally or both, depending on the rules accepted.

* Jump chess: The rook, bishop and queen may move from one side of any piece (friend or foe) to the other side in their normal direction of movement. No change for the King and Knight. Jump move is exactly two squares, and can be used to give check or to capture. Jump moves are notated using &#x27;^&#x27;. In the starting position, 1.R^a3 and 1.B^a3 are both legal. By former Pentamind champion Alain Dekker (2004).
* Kamikaze chess (or Hara-Kiri chess): When capturing, the capturing piece is removed from play also. This means a king cannot defend itself by capturing an attacker. A capture is not allowed if it exposes one&#x27;s own king to discovered check. Idea from B. G. Laws (1928). The king is royal and removing a check takes precedence over capturing. The king must be lost last; moving into check is permitted after all other pieces have been captured.
* Knight relay chess: Pieces defended by a friendly knight can move as a knight.
* Legan chess: Played as if the board would be rotated 45¬∞, initial position and pawn movements are adjusted accordingly.
* Madrasi chess (or Weird chess): A piece which is attacked by the same type of piece of the opposite color is paralysed.
* Monochromatic chess: All pieces must stay on the same color square as they initially begin.
* No Castling Chess: standard rules except that castling is not allowed, which means king safety is reduced. Proposed in 2019 by Vladimir Kramnik with the aim of reducing draws and uninteresting games, and tested on Alpha Zero.
* Patrol chess: Captures and checks are only possible if the capturing or checking piece is guarded by a friendly piece.
* PlunderChess: The capturing piece is allowed to temporarily take the moving abilities of the piece taken.
* Pocket Knight Chess (or Tombola Chess): Players have an extra knight they keep at the side of the board. Once during the game, a player may place the knight on any empty square for their move. Play then proceeds as normal.
* Portal Chess [multivariant]: Any of a number of games that involve pieces or squares for teleportation around the board(s).
* Refusal chess (or Outlaw chess, Rejection chess): A played move can be refused by the opponent, forcing the first player to change to another move, which must be accepted.
* Replacement chess (or Bhagavathi Chess, Canadian Chess, Madhouse Chess, or Repeating Chess): Captured pieces are not removed from the board but relocated by the captor to any vacant square.
* Rifle chess (or Shooting chess, Sniper chess): When capturing, the capturing piece remains unmoved on its original square, instead of occupying the square of the piece captured. 
* : This variant is played on a 16√ó16 board. In addition to the standard black and white pieces, the board is also encircled by 80 other coloured pieces (10 colours of 8 pieces each). Coloured squares near the center of the board correspond to the coloured pieces around the board, and when a player&#x27;s piece occupies a coloured square, that player gains control of the matching coloured pieces. If a piece on a coloured square is moved or captured, control of the matching pieces is lost (transferred to the other player in case of capture). Players may also switch the color of their initial army through &quot;regime change&quot;. By Mark Bates.

==== Variant end-of-game rules ====

* Anti-King chess: Features an anti-king. The anti-king moves in the same way as a king. This piece is in check when not attacked. If a player&#x27;s anti-king is in check and unable to move to a square attacked by the opponent, the player loses (checkmate). The anti-king cannot capture enemy pieces, but can capture friendly pieces. A king may not attack the opponent&#x27;s anti-king. The anti-king may not check its own king. (That is, a position when a king and an anti-king are on adjacent squares is possible, does not mean any check and does not help the anti-king to avoid check if any other piece does not attack him.) Other rules are the same as in standard chess, including check and checkmate to the regular king. By Peter Aronson (2002).
* Apocalypse: On a 5√ó5 board, each side has two knights and five pawns, win by eliminating all enemy pawns. Prepared moves are executed simultaneously. By C. S. Elliott (1976).
* Colour Chess: Played on a multicoloured board of six colours, with the order of turns taken as in Marseillais chess but with rules indicating which colour each piece may move to. The game is won by capturing the opponent&#x27;s king (rather than checkmate) and kings may remain in check. Similar variants include Sequence Colour Chess, and Swarm Colour Chess. By Tom Norfolk (2017).
*: In addition to the usual pieces, the two players have joint control of a small rubber duck which acts as a &quot;blocker&quot; (i.e. nothing can move onto or through it), and which must be moved to a new square after every turn. The goal is to successfully capture the opponent&#x27;s king. A stalemated player wins.
* Extinction chess: To win, a player must capture all of any one type of pieces of the opponent (for example, all the knights an opponent has, or all their pawns, etc.).
* Hexapawn: Played on a rectangular board of variable size with only pawns. The goal of each player is to advance one of their pawns to the opposite end of the board or to prevent the other player from moving.
* Jes√∂n Mor: Nine knights per side on a 9√ó9 board. The first to occupy square e5, and then leave it, wins the game. From Mongolia.
* King of the Hill: In addition to checkmate, a legal move that moves one&#x27;s own king to one of the center squares (d4, d5, e4, e5) wins. This is analogous to Sannin shogi&#x27;s rule that allows a player to win by legally moving their king to the center.

* Knightmate (or Mate The Knight): The goal is to checkmate the opponent&#x27;s knight (initially on e-file). The kings on b- and g-files can be captured as other pieces. Pawns can promote to kings but not to knights. By Bruce Zimov (1972).
* Losing chess (or Antichess, Giveaway chess, Suicide chess, Killer chess, Take-all chess, Take-me chess, Reverse chess): Capturing moves are mandatory and the objective is to lose all one&#x27;s pieces. There is no check; the king is captured like an ordinary piece.
* Racing Kings: Players race kings to the 8th rank. Captures, but no checks or checkmate.
* Three-check chess: Takes the &quot;three strikes, you&#x27;re out&quot; rule from baseball and applies it to chess; standard rules of chess apply, but a player can alternatively win by putting their opponent in check three times. In &quot;The Encyclopedia of Chess Variants&quot;, David Pritchard notes it being of probable Soviet origin, and that Anatoly Karpov was an &quot;invincible&quot; player in his youth.

=== Non-rectangular board ===

In this category, the movement of pieces can be modified in concurrence with the geometry of the board.

==== Hexagonal spaces ====

* Baskerville&#x27;s hexagonal chess: Earliest attempt at a strict hexagonal analog to chess. 83 cell hex board with four corners. Same as Gli≈Ñski&#x27;s Hexagonal Chess, but no special pawn moves or hex diagonal king moves. Opposing bishops occupy differently colored spaces, thus preventing them from attacking each other. By H. D. Baskerville (1929).
* Brusky&#x27;s hexagonal chess: Chess on an irregular board of 84 hex cells. Same as Gli≈Ñski&#x27;s Hexagonal Chess, but with ten pawns instead of nine, linear startup, two forward move directions for pawns, pawns capture forward diagonally, and castling. By Yakov Brusky (1966).
* De Vasa&#x27;s hexagonal chess: Chess on a rhombus-shaped board of 81 hex cells. Same as Gli≈Ñski&#x27;s Hexagonal Chess, but linear startup, two forward move directions for pawns, pawns capture forward diagonally to the side, and castling. Invented by Helge E. de Vasa (1953).
* Gli≈Ñski&#x27;s hexagonal chess: The most popular version of chess for the hex board. Includes three bishops, nine pawns, 91 hex cells. Invented by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gli≈Ñski (1936).
* McCooey&#x27;s hexagonal chess: Chess on the same hexagonal board as Gli≈Ñski&#x27;s Hexagonal Chess, but using a different starting array, seven pawns instead of nine, and pawns capture forward diagonally. By Richard Honeycutt and David McCooey (1978‚Äì1979).
* Polgar Superstar Chess: Hexagonal variant played on a special star-shaped board. Invented by L√°szl√≥ Polg√°r (2002).
* Shafran&#x27;s hexagonal chess: Chess on an irregular hex board of 70 cells. Same as Gli≈Ñski&#x27;s Hexagonal Chess, but differs by starting position, pawn first-move options, pawns capturing forward diagonally, and castling. Invented by Grigorevich Shafran (1939).
* Strozewski&#x27;s hexagonal chess: Chess on a square-shaped board of 81 hex cells. King and Knight move as if cells were squares. Invented by Casimir S. Strozewski (1976).
* : A variant inspired by the Trojan War played on a 91-cell hexagonal board. Pieces are named after characters from the myth.

==== Triangular spaces ====
* Tri-Chess: A variation of Triangular Chess. The rook and bishop are increased to six directions; the queen, to twelve. By George Dekle Sr.
* Triangular Chess: Board comprises 96 triangles. The rook and bishop have three directions; the queen, six. Three extra pawns and a unicorn. By George Dekle Sr.

==== Other 2D layouts ====
* Balbo&#x27;s Game: A novel-shaped board with 70 squares. Full armies for each player, minus one pawn. No castling. By G. Balbo (1974).
* Chessence: Nine pieces per player move according to their relative positions to each other on a 6√ó9 board with missing squares and kings immobile in the corners. By Jim Winslow (1989).
* Circular chess: Played on a circular board consisting of four rings, each of sixteen squares.
* Cross chess: Cross-shaped cells, board geometry like hex chess but moves akin to normal chess (e.g. bishops have four directions, not six; queens eight, not twelve). Extra rook, knight, and pawn per side. By George Dekle Sr.
* Cylinder chess: Played on a cylinder board with a- and h-files &quot;connected&quot;. Thus a player can use them as if the a-file were next to the h-file (and vice versa).
* Infinite chess: Numerous players and mathematicians have conceived of chess variations played on an unbounded chessboard. In one example, when using &quot;Converse&#x27;s rules,&quot; the pieces and their relative starting positions are unchanged‚Äîonly the board is infinitely large.
* Masonic Chess: Every other board rank is indented. Same as chess, with moves adapted to the new brickwork-like board. By George Dekle Sr.
* Omega chess: On a 10√ó10 board with four extra squares, one per corner. Includes the champion and wizard fairy pieces. Both are leapers, with different ways of leaping.
* Rhombic Chess: Uses a hex-shaped board comprising 72 rhombus cells. Normal set of chess pieces move &quot;edgewise&quot; or &quot;pointwise&quot;. Checkmate objective as usual. By Tony Paletta (1980).
* Rollerball: Inspired by the sci-fi film of the same name, pieces move clockwise around a Roller Derby-like track. By Jean-Louis Cazaux (1998).
* Spherical chess [multivariant]: A family of variants played on a chessboard wrapped around a sphere. The a- and h-files are adjacent. The poles are circular or octagonal and may or may not be occupied according to the variant. There are no board edges, so kings always have eight adjacent squares. Trans-polar diagonal moves mostly differentiate between variants.
*Thrones Chess: Uses a board that combines a circular component and a square component, which allows long-range pieces to attack from three sides. The board is divided into two castles and a battlefield. A piece cannot cross more than two castle walls in the same move, and a king in check may not leave a castle except to capture the piece giving check. Knights have additional non-capturing moves. By Richard Van de Venter (1999). 
* Zonal chess: Board has triangular wings or &quot;zones&quot; on either side of the main 8√ó8 board. Queens, bishops, and rooks that start from one of the squares in either zone may change direction and keep going on the same move. A queen, for example, could zig around an obstruction and attack a piece in the opposite zone. The power to change direction only applies when a piece&#x27;s move starts from a zonal area. It is possible (using the queen and rook) to cross the board from one zone to another, but any piece entering a zone cannot make use of the extended move.

==== Higher dimensional boards ====
A number of variants have been developed where the playing area is in three dimensions or more. In most cases an extra spatial dimension is represented by multiple boards being laid next to each other. Some extra-dimensional variants attempt to reflect the 3D nature of modern warfare (e.g. &quot;Raumschach&quot;, designed to reflect aerial and submarine warfare), while others incorporate fantasy or science fiction ideas such as parallel worlds and time travel. An example of the latter is the variant introduced by the 2020 computer game &quot;5D Chess with Multiverse Time Travel&quot;, which uses a varying number of boards all being played in parallel.
*5D Chess with Multiverse Time Travel: Players can move their pieces through time and between timelines, interacting with the board as it existed earlier in the game, creating alternate timelines which pieces can be moved between. The game is won if at least one king from any time and timeline is in checkmate.
* Flying chess: Played on a board of 8√ó8√ó2, giving a total of 128 cells. Only certain pieces can move to and from the additional level.
* Parallel Worlds Chess: A 3D variant using three boards, each player commands two armies, capturing either enemy king wins. The middle board is a sort of &quot;twilight zone&quot; obeying its own rules. By R. Wayne Schmittberger (1980s).

==== Multiple boards ====
* Alice Chess: Played with two boards: a piece moved on one board passes &quot;through the looking glass&quot; onto the other board. By V. R. Parton (1953).
* Chesquerque: Played on four Alquerque boards combined. Includes an extra pawn and archbishop per side. By George Dekle Sr.
* Regimental Chess: This variant is played on 1-6 adjacent 12√ó16 boards, with one white and black division for each board signified by accent colours. Each division starts with 14 infantrymen, similar to pawns but only moving one space at a time straight or diagonally forward until promoted to move one space in any direction, four bishops, four knights, four rooks, two queens and one king, and players may place their pieces into their own formation before the game starts. When a division&#x27;s king is captured, all other pieces from that division are removed from the battlefield. Pieces can move together as formations, which are connected by any compatible pieces that are adjacent or mutually supportive with one another, and capture pieces by broadsiding with walls of pieces or piercing inferior ranks with superior firepower. Pieces are mutually supportive if they are identical and are within reach of their move style; for example, two bishops are mutually supportive if they are on an adjacent diagonal path unobstructed by other pieces.

=== Variant player count ===

* Bosworth: A four-player variant played on 6√ó6 board. It uses a special card system with the pieces for spawning.
* Bughouse chess (or Exchange chess, Siamese chess, Swap chess, Tandem chess, Transfer Chess): Two teams of two players face each other on two boards. Allies use opposite colours and give captured pieces to their partner. The two-player version of the game, played with only one board, is Crazyhouse.
* Business chess [multivariant]: Played with two teams using normal chess playing rules but allowing up to five variations of the game. The team may discuss and play alternative moves freely.
* Djambi: Can be played by four players on a 9√ó9 board and four sets of special pieces. Pieces can capture or move those of an adversary. Captured pieces are not removed from the board, but turned upside down. There are variants for three or five players (&quot;Pentachiavel&quot;). (1975)
* Duchess: Notable for its wide variety of player counts; supports 2, 3, 4, or 6 players in a free-for-all, as well as 2v2, 2v2v2, or 3v3 team play. The board consists of one 4√ó5 &quot;petal&quot; for each player. These surround a core hexagonal board, which itself has two rings of squares around a central hexagonal &quot;vortex&quot; space. Three Fairy Chess pieces are used, the titular Duchess (princess), the Fortress (empress), and the Wizard, capable of teleporting friendly pieces.
* Enochian chess: A four-player variant with magical symbolism, associated with the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.
* Forchess: A four-player variant using the standard board and two sets of standard pieces.
* Fortress chess: A four-player variant played in Russia in 18th and 19th centuries.
* Four Fronts: A four-player variant created in 2012 by a Uruguayan professor named Gabriel Baldi Lemonnier.
* Four-player chess (or Four-handed, 4-Player): Can be played by four people and uses a special board and two sets of differently coloured pieces. Two modes includes: Teams or Free For All. 
* Hand and brain: Teams of two play against each other; in each team, one player is the &quot;brain&quot; and calls out a piece type, while the &quot;hand&quot; player chooses which piece of that type to move and where to move it.
* Quatrochess: A four-player variant, in addition to the standard chess army, each side controls a chancellor, archbishop, mann, wazir, fers, two camels, and two giraffes. By George Dekle Sr.
* Three-Man Chess: Three chessboard halves fused into one, first to checkmate wins. By George Dekle Sr.
* Tri-Chess: For three players; 150 triangular cells; chancellor (empress) and cardinal (princess) replacing queen. By George Dekle Sr.

=== Variants with hidden information or use of chance ===
In contrast to standard chess, which is a game of complete information, in these variants, the players do not have perfect information about the state of the board, or there is an element of chance in how the game is played after the initial setup of pieces.
*Beirut Chess: Each player secretly equips one of their pieces with a ‚Äúbomb‚Äù that can be detonated at any time, wiping out all pieces on adjacent squares. Win by checkmating the opponent, or blowing up their king. By Jim Winslow (1992).
* ChessHeads: Played with cards that change the game rules.
* Choker: A combination of chess and poker, with players betting on cards made up from pieces of a standard chess set.
* Dark chess (or Fog of War chess): The player sees only squares of the board that are attacked by their pieces.
* Dice chess [multivariant]: The pieces a player is able to move are determined by rolling a pair of dice.
* Fantasy Chess: Chess with wargaming added. Players fight for squares (which can be co-occupied) using dice. Can be expanded to four players; piece capability can improve each game.
* Knightmare Chess: Played with cards that change the game rules.
* Kriegspiel: Neither player knows where the opponent&#x27;s pieces are but can deduce them with information from a referee.
* No Stress Chess: Marketed for teaching beginners, the piece(s) a player is able to move are determined by drawing from a deck of cards, with each card providing the rules for how the piece may move. Castling and &quot;en passant&quot; are disallowed.
* Panic Chess: Player selects a piece to move, but the target square is randomized from all possible options. Captures are prioritized over non-capture moves. King, if no capture is possible, prioritizes a square not attacked by the opponent. Play ends with capture of king.
* Playing cards on a chessboard: A card game allowing open play on a board with rectangular sectors, just as in chess or checkers, but with the application of playing cards.
* Pok√©mon Chess: Each player assigns a type from Pok√©mon to each of their pieces before the game starts. A capture on a piece depends on the type of the attacking piece and defending piece: If the attacking piece&#x27;s type is super-effective towards the defending piece, the attacking piece gets to move again. If the attack is not very effective, both pieces will die, and if the defender is immune, the move is skipped. Additionally, on every capture, there is a chance of hitting a critical hit or missing, which makes the attacker go again or have their move skipped respectively. A player wins when they capture their opponent&#x27;s king; there is no check.
* Quantum Chess: Instead of a making a standard move, a player can make a &quot;quantum move&quot;, which splits the piece being moved into a &quot;superposition&quot; of two locations, each with their own &quot;probability&quot;. (Pawns cannot make quantum moves.) A succession of quantum moves can result in a piece being split into several superpositions. When that piece interacts with another piece, a measurement occurs, which causes the superpositions formed by the most recent quantum move in the history of that piece to be consolidated into a single location. The location of that consolidation depends randomly on the probabilities of the different superpositions. Playing the game by hand would require complex mathematical computations and a means of random number generation. There is a computer implementation available on the computer game platform Steam.
* Synchronous Chess: Players try to outguess each other, moving simultaneously after privately recording intended moves and anticipated results. Incompatible moves, for instance to the same square with no anticipated capture, are replayed. Alternatively, two pieces moving to the same square are both captured, unless one is the king, in which case it captures the other. Play ends with capture of king.
* Viennese Chess: A barrier or screen between the two halves of the chessboard, two players then place their pieces on their half of the board. The barrier is then lifted and the game is then played as in standard chess.

== Games inspired by chess ==
These variants are very different from chess and may be classified as abstract strategy board games instead of chess variants.
* Arimaa: A game designed in 2002 to be easy for people to understand but difficult for computers to play well. The Arimaa Challenge was a cash prize offered for developing a program able to defeat the top human Arimaa players; this was claimed in 2015.
*Hive: a bug-themed abstract strategy game designed by John Yianni and published in 2001 by Gen42 Games. The object of &quot;Hive&quot; is to capture the opponent&#x27;s queen bee by completely surrounding it, while avoiding the capture of one&#x27;s own queen.
* Martian chess: Played with Icehouse pieces.
* Navia Dratp: A cross between shogi and miniature wargaming.
* Penultima: An inductive variant where the players must deduce hidden rules invented by &quot;Spectators&quot;.
* The Duke: An abstract strategy game where the board, pieces, and gameplay mechanics have some strong parallels with chess.

==Chess-related historical and regional games==
Some of these games have developed independently while others are ancestors or relatives of modern chess. The popularity of these variants may be limited to their respective places of origin (as is largely the case for shogi), or worldwide (as is the case for xiangqi). The games have their own institutions and traditions.

* Chaturaji: Four-handed version of chaturanga, played with dice.
* Chaturanga: An ancient East Indian game, presumed to be the common ancestor of chess and other national chess-related games.

<doc id="48557" wikidata="Q49476" url="?curid=48557" title="Archbishop">
<text>In Christian denominations, an archbishop is a bishop of higher rank or office. In most cases, such as the Catholic Church, there are many archbishops who either have jurisdiction over an ecclesiastical province in addition to their own archdiocese (with some exceptions), or are otherwise granted a titular archbishopric. In others, such as the Lutheran Church of Sweden, the title is only borne by the leader of the denomination.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;archbishop&quot; () comes via the Latin . This in turn comes from the Greek , which has as components the etymons -, meaning &#x27;chief&#x27;, , &#x27;over&#x27;, and , &#x27;guardian, watcher&#x27;.

==Early history==
The earliest appearance of neither the title nor the role can be traced. The title of &quot;metropolitan&quot; was apparently well known by the 4th century, when there are references in the canons of the First Council of Nic√¶a of 325 and Council of Antioch of 341, though the term seems to be used generally for all higher ranks of bishop, including patriarchs. The term &quot;archbishop&quot; does not appear in the modern sense until the 6th century, although the role, above ordinary bishops but below patriarchs, seems to be established for metropolitans by the 5th century.

==Western Christianity==

===Metropolitan archbishops===
Episcopal sees are generally arranged in groups in which one see&#x27;s bishop has certain powers and duties of oversight over the others. He is known as the metropolitan archbishop of that see. In the Catholic Church, canon 436 of the Code of Canon Law indicates what these powers and duties are for a Latin Church metropolitan archbishop, while those of the head of an autonomous (&quot;sui iuris&quot;) Eastern Catholic Churches are indicated in canon 157 of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches. All Catholic metropolitans are archbishops, but not all archbishops are metropolitans, though most are.

===Non-metropolitan archiepiscopal sees===
As well as the much more numerous metropolitan sees, there are 77 Catholic sees that have archiepiscopal rank. In some cases, such a see is the only one in a country, such as Luxembourg or Monaco, too small to be divided into several dioceses so as to form an ecclesiastical province. In others, the title of archdiocese is for historical reasons attributed to a see that was once of greater importance.

Some of these archdioceses are suffragans of a metropolitan archdiocese; examples are the Archdiocese of Avignon, which is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Marseille, and the Archdiocese of Trnava, Slovakia. Others are immediately subject to the Holy See and not to any metropolitan archdiocese. These are usually &quot;aggregated&quot; to an ecclesiastical province. An example is the Archdiocese of Hobart in Australia, with the Metropolitan ecclesiastical province of Melbourne, but not of it. The ordinary of such an archdiocese is an archbishop.

In the Anglican Communion, non-metropolitan archiepiscopal sees are much less common. The Anglican Diocese of Jerusalem, established in 1841, was raised to the status of a non-metropolitan archiepiscopal see in 1957, but reduced to the status of an ordinary bishopric again in 1976. In 2014 it was again elevated to the status of non-metropolitan archbishopric, with its ordinary bearing the title &quot;Archbishop in Jerusalem&quot;, despite having no ex officio right to be the metropolitan of the province.

===Coadjutor archbishops===

Until 1970, a coadjutor archbishop, one who has special faculties and the right to succeed to the leadership of a see on the death or resignation of the incumbent, was assigned also to a titular see, which he held until the moment of succession. Since then, the title of Coadjutor Archbishop of the see is considered sufficient and more appropriate.

===Archbishops &quot;ad personam&quot; ===
The rank of archbishop is conferred on some bishops who are not ordinaries of an archdiocese. They hold the rank not because of the see that they head but because it has been granted to them personally (&quot;ad personam&quot;). Such a grant can be given when someone who already holds the rank of archbishop is transferred to a see that, though its present-day importance may be greater than the person&#x27;s former see, is not archiepiscopal. The bishop transferred is then known as the archbishop-bishop of his new see. An example is Gianfranco Gardin, appointed Archbishop-Bishop of Treviso on 21 December 2009. The title borne by the successor of such an archbishop-bishop is merely that of Bishop of the see, unless he also is granted the personal title of Archbishop. Another example is Arthur Roche, who was Bishop of Leeds until his appointment as Secretary of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments. Roche remained a bishop by virtue of his position as bishop emeritus of Leeds ‚Äì rather than being transferred to a different titular archbishopric, he was appointed as an archbishop &quot;ad personam&quot;.

===Titular archiepiscopal sees===
The distinction between metropolitan sees and non-metropolitan archiepiscopal sees exists for titular sees as well as for residential ones. The &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot; marks titular sees of the former class with the abbreviation &quot;Metr.&quot; and the others with &quot;Arciv.&quot;

Many of the titular sees to which nuncios and heads of departments of the Roman Curia who are not cardinals are assigned are not of archiepiscopal rank. In that case the person who is appointed to such a position is given the personal title of archbishop (&quot;ad personam&quot;). They are usually referred to as archbishop of the see, not as its archbishop-bishop.

===Archbishops emeriti===
If an archbishop resigns his see without being transferred to another, as in the case of retirement or assignment to head a department of the Roman Curia, the word &quot;emeritus&quot; is added to his former title, and he is called archbishop emeritus of his former see. Until 1970, such archbishops were transferred to a titular see.

There can be several archbishops emeriti of the same see: the 2008 &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot; listed three living archbishops emeriti of Taipei.

There is no archbishop emeritus of a titular see; an archbishop who holds a titular see keeps it until death or until transferred to another see.

In the Anglican Communion, retired archbishops formally revert to being addressed as &quot;bishop&quot; and styled &quot;The Right Reverend&quot;, although they may be appointed &quot;archbishop emeritus&quot; by their province on retirement, in which case they retain the title &quot;archbishop&quot; and the style &quot;The Most Reverend&quot;, as a right. Archbishop Desmond Tutu was a prominent example, as archbishop emeritus of Cape Town. Former archbishops who have not received the status of archbishop emeritus may still be informally addressed as &quot;archbishop&quot; as a courtesy, unless they are subsequently appointed to a bishopric (not an bishopric), in which case the courtesy ceases.

===Privileges of archbishops===

While there is no difference between the official dress of archbishops, as such, and that of other bishops, Roman Catholic metropolitan archbishops are distinguished by the use in liturgical ceremonies of the pallium, but only within the province over which they have oversight.

Roman Catholic bishops and archbishops are styled &quot;The Most Reverend&quot; and addressed as &quot;Your Excellency&quot; in most cases. In English-speaking countries (except the United States), a Catholic archbishop is addressed as &quot;Your Grace&quot;, while a Catholic bishop is addressed as &quot;Your Lordship&quot;. Before December 12, 1930, the title &quot;Most Reverend&quot; was only for archbishops, while bishops were styled as &quot;Right Reverend&quot;. This practice is still followed by Catholic bishops in the United Kingdom to mirror that of the Church of England.

In Roman Catholic heraldry, an archbishop has an ecclesiastical hat called a galero with ten tassels on each side of his coat of arms, while a bishop has only six. The archiepiscopal cross behind the shield has two bars instead of one. Such a cross may be borne before him in liturgical processions.

In processions and other occasions where strict protocol is observed, archbishops are ranked higher than diocesan bishops in the order of precedence.

In the Anglican Communion, archbishops are styled &quot;The Most Reverend&quot; and addressed as &quot;Your Grace&quot;, while bishops are styled &quot;The Right Reverend&quot; and addressed as &quot;My Lord&quot; or &quot;Your Lordship&quot;. (In some countries, this usage is followed also by the Roman Catholic Church, but in others no distinction is made and &quot;The Most Reverend&quot; and &quot;Your Excellency&quot; are used for archbishops and bishops alike.) Anglican archbishops are entitled to be preceded by a server carrying an archiepiscopal processional cross (with two bars instead of one) in liturgical processions. The archbishop of Canterbury&#x27;s metropolitical processional cross is always carried before him by a priest-chaplain, and (like other archbishops) is a two-barred processional cross. However, the archbishop of Canterbury is also entitled to be preceded by the ancient primatial cross of Canterbury (still in ceremonial use) which is of an ornate historical design, made of precious metal, and with precious stones inserted, but unlike his metropolitical cross (or those of other archbishops) it is not double-barred.

==Eastern Christianity==

Archbishops exist in all traditional denominations of the Eastern Christianity, including the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, Church of the East and the Eastern Catholic Churches

===Eastern Orthodox Church===
In the Eastern Orthodox churches, the office and title of archbishop can be traced from the 4th and 5th century. Historically, the title was used variously, in terms of rank and jurisdiction.

In some Eastern Orthodox churches, archbishops are ranked above metropolitans in precedence, while in others that order is reversed. Primates of autocephalous Eastern Orthodox churches below patriarchal rank are generally designated as archbishops. In the Greek Orthodox Church, archbishops are ranked above metropolitans in precedence. The reverse is true for some Slavic Orthodox churches (Russian Orthodox, Bulgarian Orthodox) and also for Romanian Orthodox Church, where metropolitans rank above archbishops.

In terms of jurisdiction, there are two basic types of archbishops in the Eastern Orthodox Church: real archbishops and honorary archbishops. Real archbishops are primates of autocephalous or autonomous (regional) churches, and they have actual jurisdiction over other bishops, while honorary archbishops are in fact just diocesan bishops with honorary titles of archbishops and no jurisdiction outside their own diocese. The honorary title is usually conferred to bishops of historically important sees. For example, in the Serbian Orthodox Church, both types were represented: the head of the autonomous Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric is styled &quot;Archbishop of Ohrid&quot; and invested with regional jurisdiction over all diocesan bishops in North Macedonia, while former diocesan bishop (late Amfilohije Radoviƒá) of the Eparchy of Montenegro and the Littoral, with seat in Cetinje, was personally given only the honorary title &quot;Archbishop of Cetinje&quot;, but without any jurisdiction over other diocesan bishops in Montenegro.

Historically, within the Patriarchate of Constantinople, honorary archiepiscopal titles were also granted to those diocesan bishops who were exempt from jurisdictions of local metropolitans, and transferred to the direct jurisdiction of the patriarchal throne. Such titular hierarchs were contentiously styled as &quot;autocephalous archbishops&quot; (self-headed, just in terms of not having a metropolitan, but without connotations to real autocephaly). For example, until the end of the 8th century, bishop of Amorium was under the jurisdiction of metropolitan of Pessinus, but he was later exempt and placed under direct patriarchal jurisdiction. On that occasion, he was given an honorary title of an &quot;autocephalous archbishop&quot;, but with no jurisdiction over other bishops. Sometime later (), metropolitan province of Amorium was created, and local archbishop finally gained regional jurisdiction as a metropolitan.

===Oriental Orthodox Churches===

The Oriental Orthodox custom generally agrees with the Slavic rather than the Greek with respect to the archbishop/metropolitan distinction.

===Eastern Catholic Churches===

Instead of the term &quot;archbishop&quot;, Eastern Catholic Churches sometimes use the word &quot;archeparch&quot; by analogy with &quot;eparch&quot;, the term used for a diocesan (or eparchial) bishop. However, the word &quot;archeparch&quot; is not found in the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches.

<doc id="48559" wikidata="Q34627" url="?curid=48559" title="Synagogue">
<text>A synagogue, also called a shul or a temple, is a place of worship for Jews and Samaritans. It has a place for prayer (the main sanctuary and sometimes smaller chapels) where Jews attend religious services or special ceremonies such as weddings, bar and bat mitzvahs, choir performances, and children&#x27;s plays. They also have rooms for study, social halls, administrative and charitable offices, classrooms for religious and Hebrew studies, and many places to sit and congregate. They often display commemorative, historic, or modern artwork alongside items of Jewish historical significance or history about the synagogue itself.

Synagogues are consecrated spaces used for Jewish prayer, study, assembly, and reading of the Torah (read in its entirety once a year, or in some synagogues on a triennial cycle, in weekly Torah portions during religious services). However, a synagogue is not always necessary for Jewish worship, due to adaptations during times of Jewish persecution in countries and regions that banned Judaism, frequently destroying and/or reappropriating synagogues into churches or even government buildings. Halakha (Jewish law from the Mishnah ‚Äì the &quot;Oral Torah&quot;) states that communal Jewish worship can be carried out wherever a minyan, a group of at least 10 Jewish adults, is assembled, often (but not necessarily) led by a rabbi. Worship can also happen alone or with fewer than ten people, but certain prayers are considered by halakha as solely communal; these can be recited only by a minyan. In terms of its specific ritual and liturgical functions, the synagogue does not replace the symbol of the long-destroyed Temple in Jerusalem.

Any Jew or group of Jews can build a synagogue. Synagogues have been constructed by ancient Jewish leaders, by wealthy patrons, as part of a wide range of human institutions including secular educational institutions, governments, and hotels, by the entire Jewish community of living in a particular village or region, or by sub-groups of Jewish people arrayed according to occupation, ethnicity (e.g., the Sephardic, Yemenite, Romaniote or Persian Jews of a town), style of religious observance (e.g., Reform or Orthodox synagogue), or by the followers of a particular rabbi, such as the shtiebelekh (, singular &quot;shtibl&quot;) of Hasidic Judaism.

== Terminology ==
The Hebrew term is &#x27; (◊ë◊ô◊™ ◊õ◊†◊°◊™) or &quot;house of assembly&quot;. The Koine Greek-derived word &quot;synagogue&quot; (œÉœÖŒΩŒ±Œ≥œâŒ≥ŒÆ) also means &quot;assembly&quot; and is commonly used in English, with its earliest mention in the 1st century Theodotos inscription in Jerusalem. Ashkenazi Jews have traditionally used the Yiddish term &#x27; (from the Greek &quot;schola&quot;, which is also the source of the English &quot;school&quot;) in everyday speech, and many continue to do so in English.

Sephardi Jews and Romaniote Jews generally use the term &quot;kal&quot; (from the Hebrew &quot;qahal&quot; &quot;community&quot;). Spanish and Portuguese Jews call the synagogue an and Portuguese Jews may call it a . Persian Jews and some Karaite Jews also use the term &quot;kenesa&quot;, which is derived from Aramaic, and some Mizrahi Jews use &quot;kenis&quot; or &quot;qnis&quot;.

== History ==

In the earliest period, Jewish communal worship primarily revolved around the Temple in Jerusalem, serving as a central focal point and significant symbol for the entire Jewish nation. As such, it was the destination for Jews making pilgrimages during the three major annual festivals commanded by the Torah: Passover, Shavuot and Sukkot. There are several known cases of Jewish communities in Egypt with their own temples, such as the Temple at Elephantine established by refugees from the Kingdom of Judah during the Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt, and a few centuries later, the Temple of Onias in the Heliopolite Nome.

The first synagogues emerged in the Jewish diaspora, several centuries before their introduction to the Land of Israel. Evidence points to their existence as early as the Hellenistic period, notably in Alexandria, Ptolemaic Egypt, the world&#x27;s foremost Greek-speaking city at the time. There, the first &quot;proseukh√°i&quot; (; singular &quot;proseukhƒì&quot;) were built to provide a place for communal prayer and reading and studying the Torah. Alexandrian Jews also made a Koine Greek translation of the Torah, the Septuagint. The earliest archaeological evidence for the existence of synagogues is stone dedication inscriptions from the third century BCE prove that &quot;proseukh√°i&quot; existed by that date. Philo and Josephus mention lavishly-adorned synagogues in Alexandria and in Antioch, respectively.

More than a dozen Second Temple period synagogues in use by Jews and Samaritans have been identified by archaeologists in Israel and other countries of the Hellenistic world. Following the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai, who is often credited with reformulating Judaism for the post-Temple era, advocated for the establishment of individual houses of worship since the Temple was no longer accessible.

It has been theorized that the synagogue became a place of worship in the region upon the destruction of the Second Temple during the First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War; however, others speculate that there had been places of prayer, apart from the Temple, during the Hellenistic period. The popularization of prayer over sacrifice during the years prior to the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE had prepared the Jews for life in the diaspora, where prayer would serve as the focus of Jewish worship.

Despite the certain existence of synagogue-like spaces prior to the First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War, the synagogue emerged as a focal point for Jewish worship upon the destruction of the Temple. For Jews living in the wake of the Revolt, the synagogue functioned as a &quot;portable system of worship&quot;. Within the synagogue, Jews worshipped by way of prayer rather than sacrifices, which had previously served as the main form of worship within the Second Temple.

=== Second Temple period ===
In 1995, Howard Clark Kee argued that synagogues were not a developed feature of Jewish life prior to the First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War (66‚Äì73 CE). Kee interpreted his findings as evidence that the mentions of synagogues in the New Testament, including Jesus&#x27;s visitations of synagogues in various Jewish settlements in Israel, were anachronistic. However, by 2018, Mordechai Aviam reported that there were now at least nine synagogues excavated known to pre-date the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in 70¬†CE, including in Magdala, Gamla, Masada, Herodium, Modi&#x27;in (Kh. Umm el-&#x27;Umdan), Qiryat Sepher (Kh. Bad &#x27;Issa), and Kh. Diab. Aviam concluded that he thought almost every Jewish settlement at the time, whether it was a polis or a village, had a synagogue.

* Gamla ‚Äì a synagogue was discovered near the city gate at Gamla, a site in the Golan northeast of the Sea of Galilee. This city was destroyed by the Roman army in 67 CE and was never rebuilt.
* Masada ‚Äì a synagogue was discovered on the western side of Masada, just south of the palace complex at the northern end of the site. One of the unique finds at this synagogue was a group of 14 scrolls, which included biblical, sectarian, and apocryphal documents.
* Herodium ‚Äì a synagogue from the 1st century was discovered in Herod&#x27;s palace fortress at Herodium.
* Magdala ‚Äì also known as the Migdal Synagogue, this synagogue was discovered in 2009. One of the unique features of this synagogue, which is located on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee, is an intricately carved stone block that was found in the center of the main room.
* Modi&#x27;in ‚Äì Discovered between Modi&#x27;in and Latrun is the oldest synagogue within modern Israel that has been found to date, built during the second century BCE. It includes three rooms and a nearby mikve.
=== Talmudic period ===
During Late antiquity (third to seventh century CE), literary sources attest to the existence of a large number of synagogues across the Roman-Byzantine and Sasanian Empires. Archaeological evidence indicates the presence of synagogues in at least thirteen places across the diaspora, spanning from Dura-Europos in Syria to Elche in Hispania (modern-day Spain). An especially sizable and monumental synagogue dating from this period is the Sardis Synagogue. Additionally, many inscriptions pertaining to synagogues and their officials have been discovered.

In the Land of Israel, late antiquity witnessed a significant increase in synagogue construction, in Galilee and Golan in the north and the southern hills of Judea, in the south. Each synagogue was constructed according to the means and religious customs of the local community. Notable examples include Capernaum, Bar&#x27;am, Beth Alpha, Maoz Haim, Meroth and Nabratein in the north, and Eshtemoa, Susya, Anim, and Maon in the south.

=== Middle Ages ===
Rabbi and philosopher Maimonides (1138‚Äì1204) described the various customs in his day with respect to local synagogues:

==Samaritan synagogues==
=== Name and history ===
The Samaritan house of worship is also called a synagogue. During the third and second centuries BCE, the Hellenistic period, the Greek word used in the Diaspora by Samaritans and Jews was the same, &quot;proseukhƒì&quot; , plural &quot;prosukh√°i&quot;); a third or fourth century inscription uses a similar term, &quot;euktƒìrion&quot;.

The oldest Samaritan synagogue discovered so far is from Delos in the Aegean Islands, with an inscription dated between 250 and 175¬†BCE, while most Samaritan synagogues excavated in the wider Land of Israel and ancient Samaria in particular, were built in the fourth to seventh centuries at the very end of the Roman Empire and throughout the Byzantine period.

===Distinguishing elements===
The elements which distinguish Samaritan synagogues from contemporary Jewish ones are:
* Alphabet: the use of the Samaritan script
* Orthography: When the Samaritan script is used, there are some Hebrew words which would be spelled in a way typical only for the Samaritan Pentateuch, for instance, &quot;forever&quot; is written instead of . When Greek is the language used in inscriptions, typically, Samaritans may contract two Hebrew words into one, such &quot;har&quot; &quot;mountain&quot; and Gerizim becoming . This is an archaic practice that was primarily maintained by Samaritans. 
* Orientation: The fa√ßade, or entrance, of the Samaritan synagogue, typically faces Mount Gerizim, which is the holiest site to Samaritans, while Jewish synagogues are oriented towards Jerusalem and the Temple Mount.
* Decoration: The mosaic floor and other architectural elements or artifacts are sometimes decorated with typical symbols.
**As the Samaritans have historically adhered more strictly to the commandment forbidding the creation of any &quot;graven image&quot;, they would not use any depictions of man or beast. Representations of the signs of the zodiac, of human figures or even Greek deities such as the god Helios, as seen in Byzantine-period Jewish synagogues, would be unimaginable in Samaritan buildings of any period.
** A representation of Mount Gerizim is a clear indication of Samaritan identity. On the other hand, although the existence of a Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim is both mentioned by Josephus and confirmed by archaeological excavation at its summit, the temple&#x27;s early destruction in the second century BCE led to its memory disappearing from Samaritan tradition. No temple-related items would be found in Samaritan synagogue depictions. Religious implements, such as are also known from ancient Jewish synagogue mosaics (the temple menorah, shofar, showbread table, trumpets, incense shovels, and specifically the fa√ßade of what looks like a temple or a Torah shrine) are also present in Samaritan ones, but the objects are always related to the Tabernacle, the Ark of the Covenant within the Tabernacle, or the Torah shrine in the synagogue itself. Samaritans believe that at the end of time, the Tabernacle and its utensils will be recovered from the place they were buried on Mount Gerizim, and as such they play an important role in Samaritan beliefs. Since the same artists, such as mosaicists, worked for all ethno-religious communities of the time, some depictions might be identical in Samaritan and Jewish synagogues, Christian churches, and pagan temples, but their significance would differ.
** Missing from Samaritan synagogue floors would be images often found in Jewish ones: The lulav (palm-branch) and etrog (citron fruit) have a different ritual use by Samaritans celebrating Sukkot and do not appear on mosaic floors.
* Mikvehs near the synagogue after 70¬†CE: Jews abandoned the habit of building mikvehs next to their houses of worship after the 70 CE destruction of the Jerusalem Temple, but Samaritans continued the practice.

===Archaeological finds===
Ancient Samaritan synagogues are mentioned by literary sources or have been found by archaeologists in the Diaspora, in the wider Holy Land, and specifically in Samaria.

====Diaspora====
* Delos Synagogue: a Samaritan inscription has been dated to between 250 and 175¬†BCE.
* Rome and Tarsus: ancient literature offers hints that Samaritan synagogues may have existed in these cities between the fourth and sixth centuries CE.
* Thessaloniki and Syracuse: short inscriptions found there and using the Samaritan and Greek alphabet may originate from Samaritan synagogues.

====The wider Holy Land====
* Synagogue of Salbit (now Sha&#x27;alvim), excavated by Eleazar Sukenik in 1949 northwest of Jerusalem. It was about in size, was two stories tall, and was oriented towards Mount Gerizim. Two mosaics remain, one atop the other; one contained the Samaritan version of the Song of the Sea in Exodus 15:18. It was probably built in the 4th or 5th century and destroyed in the 5th or 6th.
* The synagogue at Tell Qasile, which was built at the beginning of the seventh century.
* Synagogue A at Beisan was a room added to an existing building in the late 6th or early 7th century and served as a Samaritan synagogue. Beisan is famous for Synagogue B, the Beth Alpha synagogue, which faced Jerusalem and was not a Samaritan synagogue.

====Samaria====
* El-Khirbe synagogue, discovered c. 3¬†km from Sebaste, was built in the 4th century CE and remained in use into the Early Islamic period, with a break during the late 5th‚Äìearly 6th century
* Khirbet Samara synagogue, c. 20¬†km northwest of Nablus and built in the 4th century CE
* Zur Natan synagogue, c. 29¬†km west of Nablus and built in the 5th century CE

==Christianity==
In the New Testament, the word appears 56 times, mostly in the Synoptic Gospels, but also in the Gospel of John () and the Book of Revelation (). It is used in the sense of &#x27;assembly&#x27; in the Epistle of James (). Alternatively, the epistle of James (in Greek, clearly ·º∏Œ¨Œ∫œâŒ≤ŒøœÇ or ◊ô◊¢◊ß◊ë, anglicized to Jacob) refers to a place of assembly that was indeed Jewish, with Jacob ben Joseph perhaps an elder there. The specific word in James (Jacob) 2:2 could easily be rendered &quot;synagogue&quot;, from the Greek œÉœÖŒΩŒ±Œ≥œâŒ≥·Ω¥ŒΩ.

During the first Christian centuries, Jewish Christians are hypothesized to have used houses of worship known in academic literature as synagogue-churches. Scholars have claimed to have identified such houses of worship of the Jews who had accepted Jesus as the Messiah in Jerusalem and Nazareth.

==Architectural design==
There is no set blueprint for synagogues and the architectural shapes and interior designs of synagogues vary greatly. In fact, the influence from other local religious buildings can often be seen in synagogue arches, domes and towers.

Historically, synagogues were built in the prevailing architectural style of their time and place. Thus, the synagogue in Kaifeng, China, looked very like Chinese temples of that region and era, with its outer wall and open garden in which several buildings were arranged. The styles of the earliest synagogues resembled the temples of other cults of the Eastern Roman Empire. The surviving synagogues of medieval Spain are embellished with mud√©jar plasterwork. The surviving medieval synagogues in Budapest and Prague are typical Gothic structures.

With the emancipation of Jews in Western European countries in the 19th century‚Äîwhich not only enabled Jews to enter fields of enterprise from which they were formerly barred, but gave them the right to build synagogues without needing special permissions‚Äîsynagogue architecture blossomed. Large Jewish communities wished to show not only their wealth but also their newly acquired status as citizens by constructing magnificent synagogues. These were built across Western Europe and in the United States in all of the historicist or revival styles then in fashion. Thus there were Neoclassical,Renaissance Revival architecture, Neo-Byzantine, Romanesque Revival, Moorish Revival, Gothic Revival, and Greek Revival. There are Egyptian Revival synagogues and even one Mayan Revival synagogue. In the 19th century and early 20th century heyday of historicist architecture, however, most historicist synagogues, even the most magnificent ones, did not attempt a pure style, or even any particular style, and are best described as eclectic.

In the post-war era, synagogue architecture abandoned historicist styles for modernism.

==Interior elements==
===Bimah (platform)===
All synagogues contain a &quot;Bimah&quot;, a large, raised, reader&#x27;s platform (called (reading dais) by Sephardim), where the Torah scroll is placed to be read. In Sephardi synagogues and traditional Ashkenazi synagogues it is also used as the prayer leader&#x27;s reading desk.
===Table or lectern===
In Ashkenazi synagogues, the Torah was read on a reader&#x27;s table located in the center of the room, while the leader of the prayer service, the hazzan, stood at his own lectern or table, facing the Ark. In Sephardic synagogues, the table for reading the Torah (reading dais) was commonly placed at the opposite side of the room from the Torah Ark, leaving the center of the floor empty for the use of a ceremonial procession carrying the Torah between the Ark and the reading table. Most contemporary synagogues feature a lectern for the rabbi.

===Torah Ark===
The Torah Ark, called in Hebrew &quot;Aron Kodesh&quot; or &#x27;holy chest&#x27;
, and alternatively called the &quot;heikhal&quot;‚Äî or &#x27;temple&#x27; by Sephardic Jews, is a cabinet in which the Torah scrolls are kept.

The ark in a synagogue is almost always positioned in such a way such that those who face it are facing towards Jerusalem. Thus, sanctuary seating plans in the Western world generally face east, while those east of Israel face west. Sanctuaries in Israel face towards Jerusalem. Occasionally synagogues face other directions for structural reasons; in such cases, some individuals might turn to face Jerusalem when standing for prayers, but the congregation as a whole does not.

The Ark is reminiscent of the Ark of the Covenant, which held the tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments. This is the holiest spot in a synagogue, equivalent to the Holy of Holies. The Ark is often closed with an ornate curtain, the , which hangs outside or inside the ark doors.

===Eternal Light===

Other traditional features include a continually lit lamp or lantern, usually electric in contemporary synagogues, called the (), the &quot;Eternal Light&quot;, used as a way to honor the Divine Presence.

===Inner decoration===

A synagogue may be decorated with artwork, but in the Rabbinic and Orthodox tradition, three-dimensional sculptures and depictions of the human body are not allowed as these are considered akin to idolatry.

===Seating===
Originally, synagogues were made devoid of much furniture, the Jewish congregants in Spain, the Maghreb (North Africa), Babylonia, the Land of Israel and Yemen having a custom to sit upon the floor, which had been strewn with mats and cushions, rather than upon chairs or benches. In other European towns and cities, however, Jewish congregants would sit upon chairs and benches. Today, the custom has spread in all places to sit upon chairs and benches.

Until the 19th century, in an Ashkenazi synagogue, all seats most often faced the Torah Ark. In a Sephardic synagogue, seats were usually arranged around the perimeter of the sanctuary, but when the worshipers stood up to pray, everyone faced the Ark.

===Special seats===
Many current synagogues have an elaborate chair named for the prophet Elijah, which is only sat upon during the ceremony of Brit milah.

In ancient synagogues, a special chair placed on the wall facing Jerusalem and next to the Torah Shrine was reserved for the prominent members of the congregation and for important guests. Such a stone-carved and inscribed seat was discovered at archaeological excavations in the synagogue at Chorazin in Galilee and dates from the 4th‚Äì6th century; another one was discovered at the Delos Synagogue, complete with a footstool.

==Rules for attendees==
===Removing one&#x27;s shoes===
In Yemen, the Jewish custom was to remove one&#x27;s shoes immediately prior to entering the synagogue, a custom that had been observed by Jews in other places in earlier times. The same practice of removing one&#x27;s shoes before entering the synagogue was also largely observed among Jews in Morocco in the early 20th century. On the island of Djerba in Tunisia, Jews still remove their shoes when entering a synagogue. The custom of removing one&#x27;s shoes is no longer practiced in Israel, the United Kingdom, or the United States, and which custom, as in former times, was dependent upon whether or not the wearer considered it a thing of contempt to stand before God while wearing shoes. In Christian countries, where it was thought not offensive to stand before a king while wearing shoes, it was likewise permitted to do so in a house of prayer. However, in Karaite Judaism, the custom of removing one&#x27;s shoes prior to entering a synagogue is still observed worldwide.

===Gender separation===

In Orthodox synagogues, men and women do not sit together. The synagogue features a partition () dividing the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s seating areas, or a separate women&#x27;s section located on a balcony.

==Denominational differences==
===Reform Judaism===

The German‚ÄìJewish Reform movement, which arose in the early 19th century, made many changes to the traditional look of the synagogue, keeping with its desire to simultaneously stay Jewish yet be accepted by the surrounding culture.

The first Reform synagogue, which opened in Hamburg in 1811, introduced changes that made the synagogue look more like a church. These included: the installation of an organ to accompany the prayers (even on Shabbat, when musical instruments are proscribed by halakha), a choir to accompany the hazzan, and vestments for the synagogue rabbi to wear.

In following decades, the central reader&#x27;s table, the Bimah, was moved to the front of the Reform sanctuary‚Äîpreviously unheard-of in Orthodox synagogues.

Gender separation was also removed.

==Synagogue as community center==
Synagogues often take on a broader role in modern Jewish communities and may include additional facilities such as a catering hall, kosher kitchen, religious school, library, day care center and a smaller chapel for daily services.

==Synagogue offshoots==
Since many Orthodox and some non-Orthodox Jews prefer to collect a minyan (a quorum of ten) rather than pray alone, they commonly assemble at pre-arranged times in offices, living rooms, or other spaces when these are more convenient than formal synagogue buildings. A room or building that is used this way can become a dedicated small synagogue or prayer room. Among Ashkenazi Jews they are traditionally called (, pl. or , Yiddish for &quot;little house&quot;), and are found in Orthodox communities worldwide.

Another type of communal prayer group, favored by some contemporary Jews, is the &quot;chavurah&quot; (, pl. &quot;chavurot&quot;, ), or prayer fellowship. These groups meet at a regular place and time, either in a private home or in a synagogue or other institutional space. In antiquity, the Pharisees lived near each other in &quot;chavurot&quot; and dined together to ensure that none of the food was unfit for consumption.

==World&#x27;s oldest synagogues==


* The earliest evidence for a synagogue is a stone-carved synagogue dedication inscription found in Lower Egypt and dating from the second half of the 3rd century BCE.
* The oldest Samaritan synagogue, the Delos Synagogue, dates from between 150 and 128¬†BCE, or earlier and is located on the island of Delos.
* The synagogue of Dura Europos, a Seleucid city in north eastern Syria, dates from the third century CE. It is unique. The walls were painted with figural scenes from the Tanakh. The paintings included Abraham and Isaac, Moses and Aaron, Solomon, Samuel and Jacob, Elijah and Ezekiel. The synagogue chamber, with its surviving paintings, is reconstructed in the National Museum in Damascus.
* The Old Synagogue in Erfurt, Germany, parts of which date to c.1100, is the oldest intact synagogue building in Europe. It is now used as a museum of local Jewish history.
*The Kochangadi Synagogue (1344¬†CE to 1789¬†CE) in Kochi in the Kerala, built by the Malabar Jews. It was destroyed by Tipu Sultan in 1789¬†CE and was never rebuilt. An inscription tablet from this synagogue is the oldest relic from any synagogue in India. Eight other synagogues exist in Kerala though not in active use anymore.

* The Paradesi Synagogue is the oldest active synagogue in the Commonwealth of Nations, located in Kochi, Kerala, in India. It was built in 1568 by Paradesi community in the Kingdom of Cochin. Paradesi is a word used in several Indian languages, and the literal meaning of the term is &quot;foreigners&quot;, applied to the synagogue because it was historically used by &quot;White Jews&quot;, a mixture of Jews of the Middle East, and European exiles. It is also referred to as the Cochin Jewish Synagogue or the Mattancherry Synagogue. The synagogue is located in the quarter of Old Cochin known as Jew Town and is the only one of the eight synagogues in the area still in use.
* Jew&#x27;s Court, Steep Hill, Lincoln, England, is arguably the oldest synagogue in Europe in current use.

===Oldest synagogues in the United States===

* Congregation Shearith Israel, in New York City, founded in 1654, is the oldest congregation in the United States. Its present building dates from 1897.
* The Touro Synagogue in Newport, Rhode Island, is the oldest Jewish house of worship in North America that is still standing. It was built in 1759 for the Jeshuat Israel congregation, which was established in 1658.

==Other famous synagogues==
* The Worms Synagogue in Germany, built in 1175 and razed on Kristallnacht in 1938, was painstakingly reconstructed using many of the original stones. It is still in use as a synagogue.
* The Synagogue of El Transito of Toledo, Spain, was built in 1356 by Samuel ha-Levi, treasurer of King Pedro I of Castile. This is one of the best examples of Mud√©jar architecture in Spain. The design of the synagogue recalls the Nasrid style of architecture that was employed during the same period in the decorations of the palace of the Alhambra in Granada as well as the Mosque of C√≥rdoba. Since 1964, this site has hosted a Sephardi museum.
* The Hurva Synagogue, located in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem, was Jerusalem&#x27;s main Ashkenazi synagogue from the 16th century until 1948, when it was destroyed by the Arab Legion several days after the conquest of the city. After the Six-Day War, an arch was built to mark the spot where the synagogue stood. A complete reconstruction, to plans drawn up by architect Nahum Meltzer, opened in March 2010.
* The Abdallah Ibn Salam Mosque or Oran, Algeria, built in 1880, but converted into a mosque in 1975 when most Algerian Jews had left the country for France following independence.
*The Nidhe Israel Synagogue (&quot;Bridgetown Synagogue&quot;) of Barbados, located in the capital city of Bridgetown, was first built in 1654. It was destroyed in the hurricane of 1831 and reconstructed in 1833.
* The Cura√ßao synagogue or &quot;Snoa&quot; in Willemstad, Cura√ßao, Netherlands Antilles was built by Sephardic Portuguese Jews from Amsterdam and Recife, Brazil. It is modeled after the Esnoga in Amsterdam. Congregation Mikv√© Israel built this synagogue in 1692; it was reconstructed in 1732.
* The Bialystoker Synagogue on New York&#x27;s Lower East Side, is located in a landmark building dating from 1826 that was originally a Methodist Episcopal Church. The building is made of quarry stone mined locally on Pitt Street, Manhattan. It is an example of federal architecture. The ceilings and walls are hand-painted with zodiac frescos, and the sanctuary is illuminated by stained glass windows. The bimah and floor-to-ceiling ark are handcarved.
* The Great Synagogue of Florence, Tempio Maggiore, Florence, 1874‚Äì1882, is an example of the magnificent, cathedral-like synagogues built in almost every major European city in the 19th century and early 20th century.
* Boston&#x27;s 1920 Vilna Shul is a rare surviving intact Immigrant Era synagogue.
* The Northstar Synagogue in Arkhangelsk, Russia is the world&#x27;s northernmost synagogue building at 65.55 degrees north, second to the synagogue in Fairbanks Alaska. 
* The G√∂rlitz Synagogue in G√∂rlitz, Germany, was built in Jugendstil style between 1909 and 1911. Damaged, but not destroyed, during the Kristallnacht riots, the synagogue was bought by the City Council in 1963. After extensive renovations concluding in late 2020, the main sanctuary (Kuppelsaal with 310 seats) will be reopened for general culture, and the small synagogue (Wochentags-Synagoge, with space for around 45 visitors)

<text>In graph theory, a tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by path, or equivalently a connected acyclic undirected graph. A forest is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by path, or equivalently an acyclic undirected graph, or equivalently a disjoint union of trees.

A directed tree, oriented tree, polytree, or singly connected network is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose underlying undirected graph is a tree. A polyforest (or directed forest or oriented forest) is a directed acyclic graph whose underlying undirected graph is a forest.

The various kinds of data structures referred to as trees in computer science have underlying graphs that are trees in graph theory, although such data structures are generally rooted trees. A rooted tree may be directed, called a directed rooted tree, either making all its edges point away from the root‚Äîin which case it is called an arborescence or out-tree‚Äîor making all its edges point towards the root‚Äîin which case it is called an anti-arborescence or in-tree. A rooted tree itself has been defined by some authors as a directed graph. A rooted forest is a disjoint union of rooted trees. A rooted forest may be directed, called a directed rooted forest, either making all its edges point away from the root in each rooted tree‚Äîin which case it is called a branching or out-forest‚Äîor making all its edges point towards the root in each rooted tree‚Äîin which case it is called an anti-branching or in-forest.

The term was coined in 1857 by the British mathematician Arthur Cayley.

==Definitions==

===Tree===
A &quot;tree&quot; is an undirected graph that satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions:
* is connected and acyclic (contains no cycles).
* is acyclic, and a simple cycle is formed if any edge is added to .
* is connected, but would become disconnected if any single edge is removed from .
* is connected and the complete graph is not a minor of .
* Any two vertices in can be connected by a unique simple path.
If has finitely many vertices, say of them, then the above statements are also equivalent to any of the following conditions:
* is connected and has edges.
* is connected, and every subgraph of includes at least one vertex with zero or one incident edges. (That is, is connected and 1-degenerate.)
* has no simple cycles and has edges.
As elsewhere in graph theory, the order-zero graph (graph with no vertices) is generally not considered to be a tree: while it is vacuously connected as a graph (any two vertices can be connected by a path), it is not 0-connected (or even (‚àí1)-connected) in algebraic topology, unlike non-empty trees, and violates the &quot;one more vertex than edges&quot; relation. It may, however, be considered as a forest consisting of zero trees.

An (or inner vertex) is a vertex of degree at least 2. Similarly, an (or outer vertex, terminal vertex or leaf) is a vertex of degree 1. A branch vertex in a tree is a vertex of degree at least 3.

An (or series-reduced tree) is a tree in which there is no vertex of degree 2 (enumerated at sequence in the OEIS).

===Forest===
A is an undirected acyclic graph or equivalently a disjoint union of trees. Trivially so, each connected component of a forest is a tree. As special cases, the order-zero graph (a forest consisting of zero trees), a single tree, and an edgeless graph, are examples of forests.
Since for every tree , we can easily count the number of trees that are within a forest by subtracting the difference between total vertices and total edges. number of trees in a forest.

===Polytree===

A (or &quot;directed tree&quot; or &quot;oriented tree&quot; or &quot;singly connected network&quot;) is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose underlying undirected graph is a tree. In other words, if we replace its directed edges with undirected edges, we obtain an undirected graph that is both connected and acyclic.

Some authors restrict the phrase &quot;directed tree&quot; to the case where the edges are all directed towards a particular vertex, or all directed away from a particular vertex (see arborescence).

===Polyforest===
A (or directed forest or oriented forest) is a directed acyclic graph whose underlying undirected graph is a forest. In other words, if we replace its directed edges with undirected edges, we obtain an undirected graph that is acyclic.

As with directed trees, some authors restrict the phrase &quot;directed forest&quot; to the case where the edges of each connected component are all directed towards a particular vertex, or all directed away from a particular vertex (see branching).

===Rooted tree===
A is a tree in which one vertex has been designated the root. The edges of a rooted tree can be assigned a natural orientation, either away from or towards the root, in which case the structure becomes a directed rooted tree. When a directed rooted tree has an orientation away from the root, it is called an &quot;arborescence&quot; or &quot;out-tree&quot;; when it has an orientation towards the root, it is called an &quot;anti-arborescence&quot; or &quot;in-tree&quot;. The tree-order is the partial ordering on the vertices of a tree with if and only if the unique path from the root to passes through . A rooted tree that is a subgraph of some graph is a normal tree if the ends of every -path in are comparable in this tree-order . Rooted trees, often with an additional structure such as an ordering of the neighbors at each vertex, are a key data structure in computer science; see tree data structure.

In a context where trees typically have a root, a tree without any designated root is called a &quot;free tree&quot;.

A &quot;labeled tree&quot; is a tree in which each vertex is given a unique label. The vertices of a labeled tree on vertices (for nonnegative integers ) are typically given the labels . A &quot;recursive tree&quot; is a labeled rooted tree where the vertex labels respect the tree order (i.e., if for two vertices and , then the label of is smaller than the label of ).

In a rooted tree, the &quot;parent&quot; of a vertex is the vertex connected to on the path to the root; every vertex has a unique parent, except the root has no parent. A &quot;child&quot; of a vertex is a vertex of which is the parent. An &quot;ascendant&quot; of a vertex is any vertex that is either the parent of or is (recursively) an ascendant of a parent of . A &quot;descendant&quot; of a vertex is any vertex that is either a child of or is (recursively) a descendant of a child of . A &quot;sibling&quot; to a vertex is any other vertex on the tree that shares a parent with . A &quot;leaf&quot; is a vertex with no children. An &quot;internal vertex&quot; is a vertex that is not a leaf.

The &quot;height&quot; of a vertex in a rooted tree is the length of the longest downward path to a leaf from that vertex. The &quot;height&quot; of the tree is the height of the root. The &quot;depth&quot; of a vertex is the length of the path to its root (&quot;root path&quot;). The depth of a tree is the maximum depth of any vertex. Depth is commonly needed in the manipulation of the various self-balancing trees, AVL trees in particular. The root has depth zero, leaves have height zero, and a tree with only a single vertex (hence both a root and leaf) has depth and height zero. Conventionally, an empty tree (a tree with no vertices, if such are allowed) has depth and height ‚àí1.

A &quot;-ary tree&quot; (for nonnegative integers ) is a rooted tree in which each vertex has at most children. 2-ary trees are often called &quot;binary trees&quot;, while 3-ary trees are sometimes called &quot;ternary trees&quot;.

=== Ordered tree===
An &quot;ordered tree&quot; (alternatively, &quot;plane tree&quot; or &quot;positional tree&quot;) is a rooted tree in which an ordering is specified for the children of each vertex. This is called a &quot;plane tree&quot; because an ordering of the children is equivalent to an embedding of the tree in the plane, with the root at the top and the children of each vertex lower than that vertex. Given an embedding of a rooted tree in the plane, if one fixes a direction of children, say left to right, then an embedding gives an ordering of the children. Conversely, given an ordered tree, and conventionally drawing the root at the top, then the child vertices in an ordered tree can be drawn left-to-right, yielding an essentially unique planar embedding.

==Properties==
* Every tree is a bipartite graph. A graph is bipartite if and only if it contains no cycles of odd length. Since a tree contains no cycles at all, it is bipartite.
* Every tree with only countably many vertices is a planar graph.
* Every connected graph &quot;G&quot; admits a spanning tree, which is a tree that contains every vertex of &quot;G&quot; and whose edges are edges of &quot;G&quot;. More specific types spanning trees, existing in every connected finite graph, include depth-first search trees and breadth-first search trees. Generalizing the existence of depth-first-search trees, every connected graph with only countably many vertices has a Tr√©maux tree. However, some uncountable-order graphs do not have such a tree.
* Every finite tree with &quot;n&quot; vertices, with , has at least two terminal vertices (leaves). This minimal number of leaves is characteristic of path graphs; the maximal number, , is attained only by star graphs. The number of leaves is at least the maximum vertex degree.
* For any three vertices in a tree, the three paths between them have exactly one vertex in common. More generally, a vertex in a graph that belongs to three shortest paths among three vertices is called a median of these vertices. Because every three vertices in a tree have a unique median, every tree is a median graph.
* Every tree has a center consisting of one vertex or two adjacent vertices. The center is the middle vertex or middle two vertices in every longest path. Similarly, every &quot;n&quot;-vertex tree has a centroid consisting of one vertex or two adjacent vertices. In the first case removal of the vertex splits the tree into subtrees of fewer than &quot;n&quot;/2 vertices. In the second case, removal of the edge between the two centroidal vertices splits the tree into two subtrees of exactly &quot;n&quot;/2 vertices.
* The maximal cliques of a tree are precisely its edges, implying that the class of trees has few cliques.

==Enumeration==

=== Labeled trees ===
Cayley&#x27;s formula states that there are trees on labeled vertices. A classic proof uses Pr√ºfer sequences, which naturally show a stronger result: the number of trees with vertices of degrees respectively, is the multinomial coefficient
: formula_1

A more general problem is to count spanning trees in an undirected graph, which is addressed by the matrix tree theorem. (Cayley&#x27;s formula is the special case of spanning trees in a complete graph.) The similar problem of counting all the subtrees regardless of size is #P-complete in the general case ().

===Unlabeled trees===
Counting the number of unlabeled free trees is a harder problem. No closed formula for the number of trees with vertices up to graph isomorphism is known. The first few values of are
: 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 23, 47, 106, 235, 551, 1301, 3159, ‚Ä¶ .

This is a consequence of his asymptotic estimate for the number of unlabeled rooted trees with vertices:
: formula_4
with and the same as above (cf. , chap. 2.3.4.4 and , chap. VII.5, p.¬†475).

The first few values of are
: 1, 1, 2, 4, 9, 20, 48, 115, 286, 719, 1842, 4766, 12486, 32973, ‚Ä¶ .

==Types of trees==
* A &quot;path graph&quot; (or &quot;linear graph&quot;) consists of vertices arranged in a line, so that vertices and are connected by an edge for .
* A &quot;starlike tree&quot; consists of a central vertex called &quot;root&quot; and several path graphs attached to it. More formally, a tree is starlike if it has exactly one vertex of degree greater than 2.
* A &quot;star tree&quot; is a tree which consists of a single internal vertex (and leaves). In other words, a star tree of order is a tree of order with as many leaves as possible.
* A &quot;caterpillar tree&quot; is a tree in which all vertices are within distance 1 of a central path subgraph.
* A &quot;lobster tree&quot; is a tree in which all vertices are within distance 2 of a central path subgraph.
* A &quot;regular tree&quot; of degree is the infinite tree with edges at each vertex. These arise as the Cayley graphs of free groups, and in the theory of Tits buildings. In statistical mechanics they are known as &quot;Bethe lattices&quot;.

<text>Air traffic control (ATC) is a service provided by ground-based air traffic controllers who direct aircraft on the ground and through a given section of controlled airspace, and can provide advisory services to aircraft in non-controlled airspace. The primary purpose of ATC is to prevent collisions, organize and expedite the flow of traffic in the air, and provide information and other support for pilots.

Personnel of air traffic control monitor aircraft location in their assigned airspace by radar and communicate with the pilots by radio. To prevent collisions, ATC enforces traffic separation rules, which ensure each aircraft maintains a minimum amount of &#x27;empty space&#x27; around it at all times. It is also common for ATC to provide services to all private, military, and commercial aircraft operating within its airspace; not just civilian aircraft. Depending on the type of flight and the class of airspace, ATC may issue &quot;instructions&quot; that pilots are required to obey, or &quot;advisories&quot; (known as &quot;flight information&quot; in some countries) that pilots may, at their discretion, disregard. The pilot in command of an aircraft always retains final authority for its safe operation, and may, in an emergency, deviate from ATC instructions to the extent required to maintain safe operation of the aircraft.

==Language==

Pursuant to requirements of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), ATC operations are conducted either in the English language, or the local language used by the station on the ground. In practice, the native language for a region is used; however, English must be used upon request.

==History==
In 1920, Croydon Airport near London, England, was the first airport in the world to introduce air traffic control. The &#x27;aerodrome control tower&#x27; was a wooden hut high with windows on all four sides. It was commissioned on 25 February 1920, and provided basic traffic, weather, and location information to pilots.

In the United States, air traffic control developed three divisions. The first of several air mail radio stations (AMRS) was created in 1922, after World War I, when the U.S. Post Office began using techniques developed by the U.S. Army to direct and track the movements of reconnaissance aircraft. Over time, the AMRS morphed into flight service stations. Today&#x27;s flight service stations do not issue control instructions, but provide pilots with many other flight related informational services. They do relay control instructions from ATC in areas where flight service is the only facility with radio or phone coverage. The first airport traffic control tower, regulating arrivals, departures, and surface movement of aircraft in the US at a specific airport, opened in Cleveland in 1930. Approach / departure control facilities were created after adoption of radar in the 1950s to monitor and control the busy airspace around larger airports. The first air route traffic control center (ARTCC), which directs the movement of aircraft between departure and destination, was opened in Newark in 1935, followed in 1936 by Chicago and Cleveland. Currently in the US, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) operates 22 Air Route Traffic Control Centers.

After the 1956 Grand Canyon mid-air collision, killing all 128 on board, the FAA was given the air-traffic responsibility in the United States in 1958, and this was followed by other countries. In 1960, Britain, France, Germany, and the Benelux countries set up Eurocontrol, intending to merge their airspaces. The first and only attempt to pool controllers between countries is the Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre (MUAC), founded in 1972 by Eurocontrol, and covering Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and north-western Germany. In 2001, the European Union (EU) aimed to create a &#x27;Single European Sky&#x27;, hoping to boost efficiency and gain economies of scale.

==Airport traffic control tower==

The primary method of controlling the immediate airport environment is visual observation from the airport control tower. The tower is typically a tall, windowed structure, located within the airport grounds. The air traffic controllers, usually abbreviated &#x27;controller&#x27;, are responsible for separation and efficient movement of aircraft and vehicles operating on the taxiways and runways of the airport itself, and aircraft in the air near the airport, generally , depending on the airport procedures. A controller must carry out the job using the precise and effective application of rules and procedures; however, they need flexible adjustments according to differing circumstances, often under time pressure. In a study that compared stress in the general population and this kind of system markedly showed more stress level for controllers. This variation can be explained, at least in part, by the characteristics of the job.

Surveillance displays are also available to controllers at larger airports to assist with controlling air traffic. Controllers may use a radar system called secondary surveillance radar for airborne traffic approaching and departing. These displays include a map of the area, the position of various aircraft, and data tags that include aircraft identification, speed, altitude, and other information described in local procedures. In adverse weather conditions, the tower controllers may also use surface movement radar (SMR), surface movement guidance and control system (SMGCS), or advanced surface movement guidance and control system (ASMGCS) to control traffic on the manoeuvring area (taxiways and runways).

The areas of responsibility for tower controllers fall into three general operational disciplines: local control or air control, ground control, and flight data / clearance delivery. Other categories, such as airport apron control, or ground movement planner, may also exist at extremely busy airports. While each tower may have unique airport-specific procedures, such as multiple teams of controllers () at major or complex airports with multiple runways, the following provides a general concept of the delegation of responsibilities within the air traffic control tower environment.

Remote and virtual tower (RVT) is a system based on air traffic controllers being located somewhere other than at the local airport tower, and still able to provide air traffic control services. Displays for the air traffic controllers may be live video, synthetic images based on surveillance sensor data, or both.

===Ground control===

Ground control (sometimes known as , GMC) is responsible for the airport areas, as well as areas not released to the airlines or other users. This generally includes all taxiways, inactive runways, holding areas, and some transitional aprons or intersections where aircraft arrive, having vacated the runway or departure gate. Exact areas and control responsibilities are clearly defined in local documents and agreements at each airport. Any aircraft, vehicle, or person walking or working in these areas is required to have clearance from ground control. This is normally done via VHF / UHF radio, but there may be special cases where other procedures are used. Aircraft or vehicles without radios must respond to ATC instructions via aviation light signals, or else be led by official airport vehicles with radios. People working on the airport surface normally have a communications link through which they can communicate with ground control, commonly either by handheld radio or even cell phone. Ground control is vital to the smooth operation of the airport because this position impacts the sequencing of departure aircraft, affecting the safety and efficiency of the airport&#x27;s operation.

Some busier airports have surface movement radar (SMR), such as ASDE-3, AMASS, or ASDE-X, designed to display aircraft and vehicles on the ground. These are used by ground control as an additional tool to control ground traffic, particularly at night or in poor visibility. There is a wide range of capabilities on these systems as they are being modernised. Older systems will display a map of the airport and the target. Newer systems include the capability to display higher-quality mapping, radar targets, data blocks, and safety alerts, and to interface with other systems, such as digital flight strips.

===Air control or local control===
Air control (known to pilots as or ) is responsible for the active runway surfaces. Air control gives clearance for aircraft takeoff or landing, whilst ensuring that prescribed runway separation will exist at all times. If the air controller detects any unsafe conditions, a landing aircraft may be instructed to &#x27;go-around&#x27;, and be re-sequenced into the landing pattern. This re-sequencing will depend on the type of flight, and may be handled by the air controller, approach, or terminal area controller.

Within the tower, a highly disciplined communications process between the air control and ground control is an absolute necessity. Air control must ensure that ground control is aware of any operations that will impact the taxiways, and work with the approach radar controllers to create in the arrival traffic; to allow taxiing traffic to cross runways, and to allow departing aircraft to take off. Ground control needs to keep the air controllers aware of the traffic flow towards their runways to maximise runway utilisation through effective approach spacing. Crew resource management (CRM) procedures are often used to ensure this communication process is efficient and clear. Within ATC, it is usually known as &#x27;team resource management&#x27; (TRM), and the level of focus on TRM varies within different ATC organisations.

===Flight data and clearance delivery===
Clearance delivery is the position that issues route clearances to aircraft, typically before they commence taxiing. These clearances contain details of the route that the aircraft is expected to fly after departure. Clearance delivery, or, at busy airports, (GMP) or (TMC) will, if necessary, coordinate with the relevant radar centre or flow control unit to obtain releases for aircraft. At busy airports, these releases are often automatic, and are controlled by local agreements allowing &#x27;free-flow&#x27; departures. When weather or extremely high demand for a certain airport or airspace becomes a factor, there may be ground &#x27;stops&#x27; (or &#x27;slot delays&#x27;), or re-routes may be necessary to ensure the system does not get overloaded. The primary responsibility of clearance delivery is to ensure that the aircraft has the correct aerodrome information, such as weather and airport conditions, the correct route after departure, and time restrictions relating to that flight. This information is also coordinated with the relevant radar centre or flow control unit and ground control, to ensure that the aircraft reaches the runway in time to meet the time restriction provided by the relevant unit. At some airports, clearance delivery also plans aircraft push-backs and engine starts, in which case it is known as the (GMP): this position is particularly important at heavily congested airports to prevent taxiway and aircraft parking area gridlock.

Flight data (which is routinely combined with clearance delivery) is the position that is responsible for ensuring that both controllers and pilots have the most current information: pertinent weather changes, outages, airport ground delays / ground stops, runway closures, etc. Flight data may inform the pilots using a recorded continuous loop on a specific frequency known as the (ATIS).

==Approach and terminal control==

Many airports have a radar control facility that is associated with that specific airport. In most countries, this is referred to as &quot;terminal control&quot; and abbreviated to TMC; in the U.S., it is referred to as a &#x27;terminal radar approach control&#x27; or TRACON. While every airport varies, terminal controllers usually handle traffic in a radius from the airport. Where there are many busy airports close together, one consolidated terminal control centre may service all the airports. The airspace boundaries and altitudes assigned to a terminal control centre, which vary widely from airport to airport, are based on factors such as traffic flows, neighbouring airports, and terrain. A large and complex example was the London Terminal Control Centre (LTCC), which controlled traffic for five main London airports up to an altitude of and out to a distance of .

Terminal controllers are responsible for providing all ATC services within their airspace. Traffic flow is broadly divided into departures, arrivals, and overflights. As aircraft move in and out of the terminal airspace, they are &#x27;handed off&#x27; to the next appropriate control facility (a control tower, an en-route control facility, or a bordering terminal or approach control). Terminal control is responsible for ensuring that aircraft are at an appropriate altitude when they are handed off, and that aircraft arrive at a suitable rate for landing.

Not all airports have a radar approach or terminal control available. In this case, the en-route centre or a neighbouring terminal or approach control may co-ordinate directly with the tower on the airport and vector inbound aircraft to a position from where they can land visually. At some of these airports, the tower may provide a non-radar procedural approach service to arriving aircraft handed over from a radar unit before they are visual to land. Some units also have a dedicated approach unit, which can provide the procedural approach service either all the time, or for any periods of radar outage for any reason.

In the U.S., TRACONs are additionally designated by a three-digit alphanumeric code. For example, the Chicago TRACON is designated C90.

==Area control centre / en-route centre==
Air traffic control also provides services to aircraft in flight between airports. Pilots fly under one of two sets of rules for separation: visual flight rules (VFR), or instrument flight rules (IFR). Air traffic controllers have different responsibilities to aircraft operating under the different sets of rules. While IFR flights are under positive control, in the US and Canada, VFR pilots can request &#x27;flight following&#x27; (radar advisories), which provides traffic advisory services on a time permitting basis, and may also provide assistance in avoiding areas of weather and flight restrictions, as well as allowing pilots into the air traffic control system prior to the need to a clearance into certain airspace. Throughout Europe, pilots may request a &#x27;Flight Information Service&#x27;, which is similar to flight following. In the United Kingdom, it is known as a &#x27;basic service&#x27;.

En-route air traffic controllers issue clearances and instructions for airborne aircraft, and pilots are required to comply with these instructions. En-route controllers also provide air traffic control services to many smaller airports around the country, including clearance off the ground and clearance for approach to an airport. Controllers adhere to a set of separation standards that define the minimum distance allowed between aircraft. These distances vary depending on the equipment and procedures used in providing ATC services.

===General characteristics===
En-route air traffic controllers work in facilities called air traffic control centres, each of which is commonly referred to as a &#x27;centre&#x27;. The United States uses the equivalent term air route traffic control center. Each centre is responsible for a given flight information region (FIR). Each flight information region typically covers many thousands of square miles of airspace, and the airports within that airspace. Centres control IFR aircraft from the time they depart from an airport or terminal area&#x27;s airspace, to the time they arrive at another airport or terminal area&#x27;s airspace. Centres may also &#x27;pick up&#x27; VFR aircraft that are already airborne, and integrate them into their system. These aircraft must continue under VFR flight rules until the centre provides a clearance.

Centre controllers are responsible for issuing instructions to pilots to climb their aircraft to their assigned altitude, while, at the same time, ensuring that the aircraft is properly separated from all other aircraft in its immediate area. Additionally, the aircraft must be placed in a flow consistent with the aircraft&#x27;s route of flight. This effort is complicated by crossing traffic, severe weather, special missions that require large airspace allocations, and traffic density. When the aircraft approaches its destination, the centre is responsible for issuing instructions to pilots so that they will meet altitude restrictions by specific points, as well as providing many destination airports with a traffic flow, which prohibits all of the arrivals being &#x27;bunched together&#x27;. These &#x27;flow restrictions&#x27; often begin in the middle of the route, as controllers will position aircraft landing in the same destination so that when the aircraft are close to their destination they are sequenced.

As an aircraft reaches the boundary of a centre&#x27;s control area, it is &#x27;handed off&#x27; or &#x27;handed over&#x27; to the next area control centre. In some cases, this &#x27;hand-off&#x27; process involves a transfer of identification and details between controllers so that air traffic control services can be provided in a seamless manner; in other cases, local agreements may allow &#x27;silent handovers&#x27;, such that the receiving centre does not require any co-ordination if traffic is presented in an agreed manner. After the hand-off, the aircraft is given a frequency change, and its pilot begins talking to the next controller. This process continues until the aircraft is handed off to a terminal controller (&#x27;approach&#x27;).

===Radar coverage===
Since centres control a large airspace area, they will typically use long-range radar, that has the capability, at higher altitudes, to see aircraft within of the radar antenna. They may also use radar data to control when it provides a better &#x27;picture&#x27; of the traffic, or when it can fill in a portion of the area not covered by the long range radar.

In the U.S. system, at higher altitudes, over 90% of the U.S. airspace is covered by radar, and often by multiple radar systems; however, coverage may be inconsistent at lower altitudes used by aircraft, due to high terrain or distance from radar facilities. A centre may require numerous radar systems to cover the airspace assigned to them, and may also rely on pilot position reports from aircraft flying below the floor of radar coverage. This results in a large amount of data being available to the controller. To address this, automation systems have been designed that consolidate the radar data for the controller. This consolidation includes eliminating duplicate radar returns, ensuring the best radar for each geographical area is providing the data, and displaying the data in an effective format.
Centres also exercise control over traffic travelling over the world&#x27;s ocean areas. These areas are also flight information regions (FIRs). Because there are no radar systems available for oceanic control, oceanic controllers provide ATC services using procedural control. These procedures use aircraft position reports, time, altitude, distance, and speed, to ensure separation. Controllers record information on flight progress strips, and in specially developed oceanic computer systems, as aircraft report positions. This process requires that aircraft be separated by greater distances, which reduces the overall capacity for any given route. The North Atlantic Track system is a notable example of this method.

Some air navigation service providers (e.g., Airservices Australia, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, Nav Canada, etc.) have implemented automatic dependent surveillance ‚Äì broadcast (ADS-B) as part of their surveillance capability. This newer technology reverses the radar concept. Instead of radar &#x27;finding&#x27; a target by interrogating the transponder, the ADS-B equipped aircraft &#x27;broadcasts&#x27; a position report as determined by the navigation equipment on board the aircraft. ADS-C is another mode of automatic dependent surveillance, however ADS-C operates in the &#x27;contract&#x27; mode, where the aircraft reports a position, automatically or initiated by the pilot, based on a predetermined time interval. It is also possible for controllers to request more frequent reports to more quickly establish aircraft position for specific reasons. However, since the cost for each report is charged by the ADS service providers to the company operating the aircraft, more frequent reports are not commonly requested, except in emergency situations. ADS-C is significant, because it can be used where it is not possible to locate the infrastructure for a radar system (e.g., over water). Computerised radar displays are now being designed to accept ADS-C inputs as part of their display. This technology is currently used in portions of the North Atlantic and the Pacific by a variety of states who share responsibility for the control of this airspace.

&#x27;Precision approach radars&#x27; (PAR) are commonly used by military controllers of air forces of several countries, to assist the pilot in final phases of landing in places where instrument landing system and other sophisticated airborne equipment are unavailable to assist the pilots in marginal or &quot;near zero visibility&quot; conditions. This procedure is also called a &#x27;talk-down&#x27;.

A radar archive system (RAS) keeps an electronic record of all radar information, preserving it for a few weeks. This information can be useful for search and rescue. When an aircraft has &#x27;disappeared&#x27; from radar screens, a controller can review the last radar returns from the aircraft to determine its likely position. For an example, see the crash report in the following citation. RAS is also useful to technicians who are maintaining radar systems.

===Flight traffic mapping===
The mapping of flights in real-time is based on the air traffic control system, and volunteer ADS-B receivers. In 1991, data on the location of aircraft was made available by the Federal Aviation Administration to the airline industry. The National Business Aviation Association (NBAA), the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, the Helicopter Association International, and the National Air Transportation Association, petitioned the FAA to make ASDI information available on a &#x27;need-to-know&#x27; basis. Subsequently, NBAA advocated the broad-scale dissemination of air traffic data. The Aircraft Situational Display to Industry (ASDI) system now conveys up-to-date flight information to the airline industry and the public. Some companies that distribute ASDI information are Flightradar24, FlightExplorer, FlightView, and FlyteComm. Each company maintains a website that provides free updated information to the public on flight status. Stand-alone programmes are also available for displaying the geographic location of airborne instrument flight rules (IFR) air traffic anywhere in the FAA air traffic system. Positions are reported for both commercial and general aviation traffic. The programmes can overlay air traffic with a wide selection of maps such as, geo-political boundaries, air traffic control centre boundaries, high altitude jet routes, satellite cloud and radar imagery.

==Problems==
===Traffic===
The day-to-day problems faced by the air traffic control system are primarily related to the volume of air traffic demand placed on the system, and weather. Several factors dictate the amount of traffic that can land at an airport in a given amount of time. Each landing aircraft must touch down, slow, and exit the runway, before the next aircraft crosses the approach end of the runway. This process requires at least one, and up to four minutes for each aircraft. Allowing for departures between arrivals, each runway can thus handle about 30 aircraft arrivals per hour. A large airport with two arrival runways can handle about 60 arrivals per hour in good weather. Problems arise when airlines schedule more arrivals into an airport than can be physically handled, or when delays elsewhere cause groups of aircraft ‚Äì that would otherwise be separated in time ‚Äì to arrive simultaneously. Aircraft must then be delayed in the air by holding over specified locations until they may be safely sequenced to the runway. Up until the 1990s, holding, which has significant environmental and cost implications, was a routine occurrence at many airports. Advances in computers now allow the sequencing of aircraft hours in advance. Thus, aircraft may be delayed before they even take off (by being given a &#x27;slot&#x27;), or may reduce speed in flight and proceed more slowly thus significantly reducing the amount of holding.

Air traffic control errors occur when the separation (either vertical or horizontal) between airborne aircraft falls below the minimum prescribed separation set (for the domestic United States) by the US Federal Aviation Administration. Separation minimums for terminal control areas (TCAs) around airports are lower than en-route standards. Errors generally occur during periods following times of intense activity, when controllers tend to relax and overlook the presence of traffic and conditions that lead to loss of minimum separation.

===Weather===

Beyond runway capacity issues, the weather is a major factor in traffic capacity. Rain, ice, snow, or hail on the runway cause landing aircraft to take longer to slow and exit, thus reducing the safe arrival rate, and requiring more space between landing aircraft. Fog also requires a decrease in the landing rate. These, in turn, increase airborne delay for holding aircraft. If more aircraft are scheduled than can be safely and efficiently held in the air, a ground delay programme may be established, delaying aircraft on the ground before departure due to conditions at the arrival airport.

In Area Control Centres, a major weather problem is thunderstorms, which present a variety of hazards to aircraft. Airborne aircraft will deviate around storms, reducing the capacity of the en-route system, by requiring more space per aircraft, or causing congestion, as many aircraft try to move through a single hole in a line of thunderstorms. Occasionally, weather considerations cause delays to aircraft prior to their departure as routes are closed by thunderstorms.

Much money has been spent on creating software to streamline this process. However, at some ACCs, air traffic controllers still record data for each flight on strips of paper and personally coordinate their paths. In newer sites, these flight progress strips have been replaced by electronic data presented on computer screens. As new equipment is brought in, more and more sites are upgrading away from paper flight strips.

===Congestion===
Constrained control capacity and growing traffic lead to flight cancellation and delays:
*In America, delays caused by ATC grew by 69% between 2012 and 2017. ATC staffing issues were a major factor in congestion.
*In China, the average delay per domestic flight spiked by 50% in 2017 to 15 minutes per flight.
*In Europe, en route delays grew by 105% in 2018, due to a lack of capacity or staff (60%), weather (25%) or strikes (14%), costing the European economy ‚Ç¨17.6bn ($20.8bn), up by 28% on 2017.
By then the market for air-traffic services was worth $14bn. More efficient ATC could save 5-10% of aviation fuel by avoiding holding patterns and indirect airways.

The military takes 80% of Chinese airspace, congesting the thin corridors open to airliners. The United Kingdom closes its military airspace only during military exercises.

==Call signs==
A prerequisite to safe air traffic separation is the assignment and use of distinctive call signs. These are permanently allocated by ICAO on request, usually to scheduled flights, and some air forces and other military services for military flights. There are written call signs with a two or three¬†letter combination followed by the flight number such as AAL872 or VLG1011. As such, they appear on flight plans and ATC radar labels. There are also the &quot;audio&quot; or &quot;radio-telephony&quot; call signs used on the radio contact between pilots and air traffic control. These are not always identical to their written counterparts. An example of an audio call sign would be &#x27;Speedbird 832&#x27;, instead of the written &#x27;BAW832&#x27;. This is used to reduce the chance of confusion between ATC and the aircraft. By default, the call sign for any other flight is the registration number (or tail number in US parlance) of the aircraft, such as &#x27;N12345&#x27;, &#x27;C-GABC&#x27;, or &#x27;EC-IZD&#x27;. The short &quot;radio-telephony&quot; call signs for these tail numbers is the last three letters using the NATO phonetic alphabet (e.g. ABC, spoken &quot;alpha-bravo-charlie&quot; for C-GABC), or the last three numbers (e.g. &quot;three-four-five&quot; for N12345). In the United States, the prefix may be an aircraft type, model, or manufacturer in place of the first registration character, for example, &#x27;N11842&#x27; could become &#x27;Cessna 842&#x27;. This abbreviation is only allowed after communications have been established in each sector.

Before around 1980, International Air Transport Association (IATA) and ICAO were using the same two-letter call signs. Due to the larger number of new airlines after deregulation, the ICAO established the three-letter call signs as mentioned above. The IATA call signs are currently used in aerodromes on the announcement tables, but are no longer used in air traffic control. For example, AA is the IATA call sign for American Airlines; the ATC equivalent is AAL. Flight numbers in regular commercial flights are designated by the aircraft operator, and identical call sign might be used for the same scheduled journey each day it is operated, even if the departure time varies a little across different days of the week. The call sign of the return flight often differs only by the final digit from the outbound flight. Generally, airline flight numbers are even if east-bound, and odd if west-bound. In order to reduce the possibility of two call signs on one frequency at any time sounding too similar, a number of airlines, particularly in Europe, have started using alphanumeric call signs that are not based on flight numbers (e.g. DLH23LG, spoken as &quot;Lufthansa-two-three-lima-golf&quot;, to prevent confusion between incoming DLH23 and outgoing DLH24 in the same frequency). Additionally, it is the right of the air traffic controller to change the &#x27;audio&#x27; call sign for the period the flight is in his sector if there is a risk of confusion, usually choosing the aircraft registration identifier instead.

==Technology==
Many technologies are used in air traffic control systems. Primary and secondary radars are used to enhance a controller&#x27;s situational awareness within their assigned airspace; all types of aircraft send back primary echoes of varying sizes to controllers&#x27; screens as radar energy is bounced off their skins, and transponder-equipped aircraft reply to secondary radar interrogations by giving an ID (Mode A), an altitude (Mode C), and / or a unique callsign (Mode S). Certain types of weather may also register on the radar screen. These inputs, added to data from other radars, are correlated to build the air situation. Some basic processing occurs on the radar tracks, such as calculating ground speed and magnetic headings.

Usually, a flight data processing system manages all the flight plan related data, incorporating, in a low or high degree, the information of the track once the correlation between them (flight plan and track) is established. All this information is distributed to modern operational display systems, making it available to controllers.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has spent over US$3¬†billion on software, but a fully automated system is still yet to be achieved. In 2002, the United Kingdom commissioned a new area control centre into service at the London Area Control Centre (LACC) at Swanwick in Hampshire, relieving a busy suburban centre at West Drayton in Middlesex, north of London Heathrow Airport. Software from Lockheed-Martin predominates at the London Area Control Centre. However, the centre was initially troubled by software and communications problems causing delays and occasional shutdowns.

Some tools are available in different domains to help the controller further:
*Flight data processing systems: this is the system (usually one per centre) that processes all the information related to the flight (the flight plan), typically in the time horizon from gate to gate (airport departure / arrival gates). It uses such processed information to invoke other flight plan related tools (such as e.g. Medium Term Conflict Detection (MTCD), and distributes such processed information to all the stakeholders (air traffic controllers, collateral centres, airports, etc).
*Short-term conflict alert (STCA) that checks possible conflicting trajectories in a time horizon of about two or three minutes (or even less in approach context; 35 seconds in the French Roissy &amp; Orly approach centres) and alerts the controller prior to the loss of separation. The algorithms used may also provide in some systems a possible vectoring solution, that is, the manner in which to turn, descend, increase / decrease speed, or climb the aircraft in order to avoid infringing the minimum safety distance or altitude clearance.
*Minimum safe altitude warning (MSAW): a tool that alerts the controller if an aircraft appears to be flying too low to the ground or will impact terrain based on its current altitude and heading.
*System coordination (SYSCO) to enable controller to negotiate the release of flights from one sector to another.
*Area penetration warning (APW) to inform a controller that a flight will penetrate a restricted area.
*Arrival and departure manager to help sequence the takeoff and landing of aircraft.
**The departure manager (DMAN): a system aid for the ATC at airports, that calculates a planned departure flow with the goal to maintain an optimal throughput at the runway, reduce queuing at holding point, and distribute the information to various stakeholders at the airport (i.e. the airline, ground handling and air traffic control (ATC)).
**The arrival manager (AMAN): a system aid for the ATC at airports, that calculates a planned arrival flow with the goal to maintain an optimal throughput at the runway, reduce arrival queuing and distribute the information to various stakeholders.
**Passive final approach spacing tool (pFAST): a CTAS tool, provides runway assignment and sequence number advisories to terminal controllers to improve the arrival rate at congested airports. pFAST was deployed and operational at five US TRACONs before being cancelled. NASA research included an active FAST capability that also provided vector and speed advisories to implement the runway and sequence advisories.
*Converging runway display aid (CRDA): enables approach controllers to run two final approaches that intersect, and make sure that go arounds are minimised.
*Center TRACON automation system (CTAS): a suite of human centred decision support tools developed by NASA Ames Research Center. Several of the CTAS tools have been field tested and transitioned to the FAA for operational evaluation and use. Some of the CTAS tools are: traffic management advisor (TMA), passive final approach spacing tool (pFAST), collaborative arrival planning (CAP), direct-to (D2), en route descent advisor (EDA), and multi-center TMA. The software is running on Linux.
*Traffic management advisor (TMA): a CTAS tool, is an en-route decision support tool that automates time based metering solutions to provide an upper limit of aircraft to a TRACON from the centre over a set period of time. Schedules are determined that will not exceed the specified arrival rate, and controllers use the scheduled times to provide the appropriate delay to arrivals, while in the en-route domain. This results in an overall reduction in en-route delays, and also moves the delays to more efficient airspace (higher altitudes) than occur if holding near the TRACON boundary, which is required in order to prevent overloading the TRACON controllers. TMA is operational at most en-route air route traffic control centres (ARTCCs), and continues to be enhanced to address more complex traffic situations (e.g. adjacent centre metering (ACM) and en route departure capability (EDC))
*MTCD and URET
**In the US, user request evaluation tool (URET) takes paper strips out of the equation for en-route controllers at ARTCCs by providing a display that shows all aircraft that are either in, or currently routed into the sector.
**In Europe, several MTCD tools are available: (National Air Traffic Services), VAFORIT (Deutsche Flugsicherung), new FDPS (Maastricht Upper Area Control). The Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) programme should soon launch new MTCD concepts.
:URET and MTCD provide conflict advisories up to 30¬†minutes in advance, and have a suite of assistance tools that assist in evaluating resolution options and pilot requests.
*Mode S: provides a data downlink of flight parameters via secondary surveillance radars allowing radar processing systems and therefore controllers to see various data on a flight, including airframe unique id (24-bits encoded), indicated airspeed, and flight director selected level, amongst others.
*Controller‚Äìpilot data link communications (CPDLC): allows digital messages to be sent between controllers and pilots, avoiding the need to use radiotelephony. It is especially useful in areas where difficult-to-use HF radiotelephony was previously used for communication with aircraft, e.g. oceans. This is currently in use in various parts of the world including the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
*ADS-B: automatic dependent surveillance broadcast; provides a data downlink of various flight parameters to air traffic control systems via the transponder (1090¬†MHz), and reception of those data by other aircraft in the vicinity. The most important is the aircraft&#x27;s latitude, longitude and level: such data can be utilised to create a radar-like display of aircraft for controllers, and thus allows a form of pseudo-radar control to be done in areas where the installation of radar is either prohibitive on the grounds of low traffic levels, or technically not feasible (e.g. oceans). This is currently in use in Australia, Canada, and parts of the Pacific Ocean, and Alaska.

*The electronic flight strip system (e-strip): a system of electronic flight strips replacing the existing paper strips is being used by several service providers, such as Nav Canada, MASUAC, DFS, DECEA. E-strips allows controllers to manage electronic flight data online without paper strips, reducing the need for manual functions, creating new tools, and reducing the ATCO&#x27;s workload. The firsts electronic flight strips systems were independently and simultaneously invented and implemented by Nav Canada and Saipher ATC in 1999. The Nav Canada system known as EXCDS and rebranded in 2011 to NAVCANstrips, and Saipher&#x27;s first generation system known as SGTC, which is now being updated by its 2nd generation system, the TATIC TWR. DECEA in Brazil is the world&#x27;s largest user of tower e-strips system, ranging from very small airports up to the busiest ones, taking the advantage of real time information and data collection from each of more than 150 sites for use in air traffic flow management (ATFM), billing, and statistics.
*Screen content recording: hardware or software based recording function which is part of most modern automation system, and that captures the screen content shown to the ATCO. Such recordings are used for a later replay together with audio recording for investigations and post event analysis.
*Communication navigation surveillance / air traffic management (CNS / ATM) systems are communications, navigation, and surveillance systems, employing digital technologies, including satellite systems, together with various levels of automation, applied in support of a seamless global air traffic management system.

==Proposed changes==
In the United States, some alterations to traffic control procedures are being examined:
*The Next Generation Air Transportation System examines how to overhaul the United States national airspace system.
*Free flight is a developing air traffic control method that uses no centralised control (e.g. air traffic controllers). Instead, parts of airspace are reserved dynamically and automatically in a distributed way using computer communication to ensure the required separation between aircraft.
In Europe, the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) programme plans to develop new methods, technologies, procedures, and systems to accommodate future (2020 and beyond) air traffic needs. In October 2018, European controller unions dismissed setting targets to improve ATC as &quot;a waste of time and effort&quot;, as new technology could cut costs for users but threaten their jobs. In April 2019, the EU called for a &#x27;Digital European Sky&#x27;, focusing on cutting costs by including a common digitisation standard, and allowing controllers to move to where they are needed instead of merging national ATCs, as it would not solve all problems. Single air-traffic control services in continent-sized America and China does not alleviate congestion. Eurocontrol tries to reduce delays by diverting flights to less busy routes: flight paths across Europe were redesigned to accommodate the new airport in Istanbul, which opened in April, but the extra capacity will be absorbed by rising demand for air travel.
Well-paid jobs in western Europe could move east with cheaper labour. The average Spanish controller earn over ‚Ç¨200,000 a year, over seven times the country average salary, more than pilots, and at least ten controllers were paid over ‚Ç¨810,000 ($1.1m) a year in 2010. French controllers spent a cumulative nine months on strike between 2004 and 2016.

===Privatisation===
Many countries have also privatised or corporatised their air navigation service providers. There are several models that can be used for ATC service providers. The first is to have the ATC services be part of a government agency as is currently the case in the United States. The problem with this model is that funding can be inconsistent, and can disrupt the development and operation of services. Sometimes funding can disappear when lawmakers cannot approve budgets in time. Both proponents and opponents of privatisation recognise that stable funding is one of the major factors for successful upgrades of ATC infrastructure. Some of the funding issues include sequestration and politicisation of projects. Proponents argue that moving ATC services to a private corporation could stabilise funding over the long term which will result in more predictable planning and rollout of new technology as well as training of personnel. As of November 2024, The United States had 265 contractor towers that are staffed by private companies but administered by FAA through its FAA Contract Tower Program, which was established in 1982. These contract control towers cover 51% of all the Federal air traffic control towers in the U.S..

Another model is to have ATC services provided by a government corporation. This model is used in Germany, where funding is obtained through user fees. Yet another model is to have a for-profit corporation operate ATC services. This is the model used in the United Kingdom, but there have been several issues with the system there, including a large-scale failure in December 2014 which caused delays and cancellations and has been attributed to cost-cutting measures put in place by this corporation. In fact, earlier that year, the corporation owned by the German government won the bid to provide ATC services for Gatwick Airport in the United Kingdom. The last model, which is often the suggested model for the United States to transition to is to have a non-profit organisation that would handle ATC services as is used in Canada.

The Canadian system is the one most often used as a model by proponents of privatisation. Air traffic control privatisation has been successful in Canada with the creation of Nav Canada, a private non-profit organisation which has reduced costs, and has allowed new technologies to be deployed faster due to the elimination of much of the bureaucratic red tape. This has resulted in shorter flights and less fuel usage. It has also resulted in flights being safer due to new technology. Nav Canada is funded from fees that are collected from the airlines based on the weight of the aircraft and the distance flown.
Air traffic control is operated by national governments with few exceptions: in the European Union, only Italy has private shareholders. Privatisation does not guarantee lower prices: the profit margin of MUAC was 70% in 2017, as there is no competition, but governments could offer fixed terms concessions. Australia, Fiji, and New Zealand run the upper-airspace for the Pacific islands&#x27; governments. HungaroControl offers remote airport tower services from Budapest, and since 2014 provides upper airspace management for Kosovo.

==ATC regulations in the United States==
The United States airspace is divided into 21 zones (centres), and each zone is divided into sectors. Also within each zone are portions of airspace, about in diameter, called TRACON (Terminal Radar Approach Control) airspaces. Within each TRACON airspace are a number of airports, each of which has its own airspace with a radius. FAA control tower operators (CTO) / air traffic controllers use FAA Order 7110.65 as the authority for all procedures regarding air traffic.

<text>An ecovillage is a traditional or intentional community that aims to become more socially, culturally, economically and/or environmentally sustainable. An ecovillage strives to have the least possible negative impact on the natural environment through the intentional physical design and behavioural choices of its inhabitants. It is consciously designed through locally owned, participatory processes to regenerate and restore its social and natural environments. Most range from a population of 50 to 250 individuals, although some are smaller, and traditional ecovillages are often much larger. Larger ecovillages often exist as networks of smaller sub-communities. Some ecovillages have grown through like-minded individuals, families, or other small groups‚Äîwho are not members, at least at the outset‚Äîsettling on the ecovillage&#x27;s periphery and participating &quot;de facto&quot; in the community. There are currently more than 10,000 ecovillages around the world.

Ecovillagers are united by shared ecological, social-economic and cultural-spiritual values. Concretely, ecovillagers seek alternatives to ecologically destructive electrical, water, transportation, and waste-treatment systems, as well as the larger social systems that mirror and support them. Many see the breakdown of traditional forms of community, wasteful consumerist lifestyles, the destruction of natural habitat, urban sprawl, factory farming, and over-reliance on fossil fuels as trends that must be changed to avert ecological disaster and create richer and more fulfilling ways of life.

Ecovillages offer small-scale communities with minimal ecological impact or regenerative impacts as an alternative. However, such communities often cooperate with peer villages in networks of their own (&quot;see&quot; Global Ecovillage Network (GEN) for an example). This model of collective action is similar to that of Ten Thousand Villages, which supports the fair trade of goods worldwide.

The concept of the ecovillage has undergone significant development over time, as evidenced by the remarkable growth and evolution of these communities over the past few decades. The various facets of the ecovillage include case studies of community models, discussions on sustainability alignment for diverse needs, examinations of their environmental impact, explorations of governance structures, and considerations of the challenges faced on their path towards a successful ecovillage.

==Definition==
Multiple sources define ecovillages as a subtype of intentional communities focusing on sustainability. More pronounced definitions are listed here:
In Joubert&#x27;s view, ecovillages are seen as an ongoing process, rather than a particular outcome. They often start off with a focus on one of the four dimensions of sustainability, e.g. ecology, but evolve into holistic models for restoration. In this view, aiming for sustainability is not enough; it is vital to restore and regenerate the fabric of life and across all four dimensions of sustainability: social, environmental, economic and cultural.

Ecovillages have developed in recent years as technology has improved, so they have more sophisticated structures as noted by Baydoun, M. 2013.

Generally, the ecovillage concept is not tied to specific sectarian (religious, political, corporate) organizations or belief systems not directly related to environmentalism, such as monasteries, cults, or communes.

==History==
The modern-day desire for community was notably characterized by the communal &quot;back to the land&quot; movement of the 1960s and 1970s through communities such as the earliest example that still survives, the Miccosukee Land Co-op co-founded in May 1973 by James Clement van Pelt in Tallahassee, Florida. In the same decades, the imperative for alternatives to radically inefficient energy-use patterns, in particular automobile-enabled suburban sprawl, was brought into focus by recurrent energy crises. The term &quot;eco-village&quot; was introduced by Georgia Tech Professor George Ramsey in a 1978 address, &quot;Passive Energy Applications for the Built Environment&quot;, to the First World Energy Conference of the Association of Energy Engineers, to describe small-scale, car-free, close-in developments, including suburban infill, arguing that &quot;the great energy waste in the United States is not in its technology; it is in its lifestyle and concept of living.&quot; Ramsey&#x27;s article includes a sketch for a &quot;self-sufficient pedestrian solar village&quot; by one of his students that looks very similar to eco-villages today.

The movement became more focused and organized in the cohousing and related alternative-community movements of the mid-1980s. Then, in 1991, Robert Gilman and Diane Gilman co-authored a germinal study called &quot;Ecovillages and Sustainable Communities&quot; for Gaia Trust, in which the ecological and communitarian themes were brought together.

The first Eco-Village in North America began its first stages in 1990. Earthaven Eco-Village in Black Mountain, NC was the first community called an Eco-Village and was designed using permaculture (holistic) principles. The first residents moved onto the vacant land in 1993. As of 2019 Earthaven Eco-Village has over 70 families living off the grid on 368 acres of land.

The ecovillage movement began to coalesce at the annual autumn conference of Findhorn, in Scotland, in 1995. The conference was called: &quot;Ecovillages and Sustainable Communities&quot;, and conference organizers turned away hundreds of applicants. According to Ross Jackson, &quot;somehow they had struck a chord that resonated far and wide. The word &#x27;ecovillage&#x27;... thus became part of the language of the Cultural Creatives.&quot; After that conference, many intentional communities, including Findhorn, began calling themselves &quot;ecovillages&quot;, giving birth to a new movement. The Global Ecovillage Network, formed by a group of about 25 people from various countries who had attended the Findhorn conference, crystallized the event by linking hundreds of small projects from around the world, that had similar goals but had formerly operated without knowledge of each other. Gaia Trust of Denmark agreed to fund the network for its first five years.

Since the 1995 conference, a number of the early members of the Global Ecovillage Network have tried other approaches to ecovillage building in an attempt to build settlements that would be attractive to mainstream culture in order to make sustainable development more generally accepted. One of these with some degree of success is Living Villages and The Wintles where eco-houses are arranged so that social connectivity is maximized and residents have shared food growing areas, woodlands, and animal husbandry for greater sustainability.

The most recent worldwide update emerges from the 2022 Annual Report of GEN International, detailing the mapping of 1,043 ecovillage communities on GEN&#x27;s interactive ecovillage map. GEN collaborated closely with a diverse array of researchers and ecovillage communities spanning the globe to develop the Ecovillage Impact Assessment. Their innovative tool serves as a means for communities, groups, and individuals to accurately report, chart, evaluate, and present their efforts toward fostering participatory cultural, social, ecological, and economic regeneration. Over the course of three years, from February 2021 to April 2024, data from 140 surveys conducted within 75 ecovillages formed the basis of the comprehensive results. Through this assessment ecovillages are empowered to understand their impact and influence their community has had.

== Case studies ==
== Sustainability alignment ==
Ecovillages are defined by their commitment sustainability through a multitude of design, lifestyle, and community objectives. They prioritize environmental stewardship through various methods, including the utilization of renewable energy sources, the minimization of waste through recycling and composting, and the practice of organic agriculture and permaculture. In many cases, these communities strive for self-sufficiency in food production, with the aim of reducing the ecological footprint associated with food transportation. Ecovillage communities place a strong emphasis on the conservation of resources through the application of green building techniques, including passive solar design, natural insulation, and rainwater harvesting. Additionally, they promote alternative modes of transportation, such as cycling and walking, as a means of reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The objective of ecovillages is to cultivate robust social connections and a sense of belonging among residents through the promotion of collaboration, consensus-based decision-making, and shared responsibilities. This approach fosters a supportive environment that enhances both individual and collective resilience. Ecovillages represent an international phenomenon that encompasses cultural diversity, frequently integrating traditional wisdom alongside innovative practices. Many ecovillages espouse multiculturalism, indigenous knowledge, and participation as means of enhancing intergenerational learning. In essence, these communities endeavor to achieve sustainable living through a multitude of diverse efforts, offering valuable insight into the creation of a sustainable relationship between humanity and the natural world. In essence, these communities aim for sustainable living through a multitude of various efforts and offer valuable insight for creating a sustainable relationship between humanity and the natural world.

== Environmental impact ==
The formation of ecovillages is frequently driven by a concern for environmental stewardship and a commitment to sustainable practices. Ecovillages frequently employ reusable power sources, such as solar and wind energy, and utilize natural materials, including mud, wood, and straw, in their construction. Such technologies as bioclimatic agriculture are employed in this regard.

A study on an ecovillage in Ithaca, New York found that the average ecological footprint of a resident in the ecovillage was 70% less than the ecological footprint of most Americans. Ecovillage residents seek a sustainable lifestyle (for example, of voluntary simplicity) for inhabitants with a minimum of trade outside the local area, or ecoregion. Many seek independence from existing infrastructures, although others, particularly in more urban settings, pursue more integration with existing infrastructure. Rural ecovillages are usually based on organic farming, permaculture and other approaches which promote ecosystem function and biodiversity. Ecovillages, whether urban or rural, tend to integrate community and ecological values within a principle-based approach to sustainability, such as permaculture design. In 2019, a study assessed the impact of community sustainability through a life cycle assessment conducted on three ecovillages. The results of this study revealed a substantial reduction in carbon emissions among residents of these ecovillages when compared to the average United States citizen. This study reported that residents had a 63% to 71% decrease in carbon emissions due to living in an ecovillage with sustainable practices and mitigation efforts to environmental impact.

==Governance==
Ecovillages, while united by their commitment to sustainability and communal living, often differ in their approaches to governance. Every ecovillage strives to reflect the diverse needs and values of their communities. Ultimately, the choice of governance model within ecovillages aims to demonstrates a balance between fostering community cohesion, promoting sustainability, and accommodating the varied needs and values of their members.

Establishing governance is a common method used by ecovillages to align individual actions with community objectives. Most ecovillages maintain a distinct set of policies to govern aspects of what keeps their society functioning. Policies within ecovillages are meant to evolve with new situations prompting revisions to existing guidelines. Ecovillages commonly incorporate elements of consensus decision-making into their governance processes. This approach aims to mitigate hierarchies, power imbalances, and inflexibility within their governments. The governmental framework designed in the Ecovillage Tamera, Portugal promotes inclusivity that actively works to combat hierarchical structures. The Tamera community attributes their success to their Women&#x27;s Council who confront patriarchal norms and empower women within the governance system. Members of ecovillage communities will select their peers to serve as government members based on established trust within the community, this serves as an active strategy to mitigate the emergence of hierarchies. Through involvement of community members in reviewing and revising existing rules, ecovillages ensure flexibility and adaptability to evolving needs. Active participation in policy formulation fosters a sense of ownership among members regarding community expectations and boundaries. Ecovillage community members express their contentment knowing they had the opportunity to voice their concerns and contribute to the decision-making process.

Each ecovillage exhibits a unique approach to how they will develop their governance. Ecovillages acknowledge that there is a delicate balance in maintaining a functioning community that appreciates and considers the perspectives of its members. Through active involvement in the governance processes, ecovillages demonstrate a commitment to inclusivity, adaptability, and collective empowerment, demonstrating the principles of collaborative decision-making and community-driven change.

== Challenges ==
While ecovillages aim to embody admirable dimensions of sustainability and community, they are not without their challenges. One significant challenge is the initial investment required to establish or transition to an ecovillage lifestyle. The costs of acquiring land, implementing sustainable infrastructure, and maintaining communal facilities can be prohibitive for some individuals or groups making available funds a limiting factor. Conflicts can arise regarding community rules, resource allocation, or individual responsibilities, it can be difficult to maintain cohesion which can be expected in any community type. An explorative study results concluded that the perceived quality of life of residents in eco-developments rated higher perceived quality of life than residents of developments in conventional settings while still noting various challenges they experienced. Another noteworthy challenge can be limited access to resources, like land that is adequate for agriculture, available water or renewable energy potential which can limit the viability of ecovillage initiatives.

<doc id="48569" wikidata="Q57410" url="?curid=48569" title="Shimon Peres">
<text>Shimon Peres ( ; ; born Szymon Perski, ; 2 August 1923 ‚Äì 28 September 2016) was an Israeli politician and statesman who served as the eighth prime minister of Israel from 1984 to 1986 and from 1995 to 1996 and as the ninth president of Israel from 2007 to 2014. He was a member of twelve cabinets and represented five political parties in a political career spanning 70 years. Peres was elected to the Knesset in November 1959 and except for three months out of office in early 2006, served as a member of the Knesset continuously until he was elected president in 2007. Serving in the Knesset for 48 years (with the first uninterrupted stretch lasting more than 46 years), Peres is the longest serving member in the Knesset&#x27;s history. At the time of his retirement from politics in 2014, he was the world&#x27;s oldest head of state and was considered the last link to Israel&#x27;s founding generation.

From a young age, he was renowned for his oratorical brilliance, and was chosen as a prot√©g√© by David Ben-Gurion, Israel&#x27;s founding father. He began his political career in the late 1940s, holding several diplomatic and military positions during and directly after the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. His first high-level government position was as deputy director general of defense in 1952 which he attained at the age of 28, and director general from 1953 until 1959. In 1956, he took part in the historic negotiations on the Protocol of S√®vres, which was described by British Prime Minister Anthony Eden as the &quot;highest form of statesmanship&quot;. In 1963, he held negotiations with U.S. President John F. Kennedy, which resulted in the sale of Hawk anti-aircraft missiles to Israel, the first sale of U.S. military equipment to Israel. Peres represented Mapai, Rafi, the Alignment, Labor and Kadima in the Knesset, and led Alignment and Labor.

Peres first succeeded Yitzhak Rabin as acting prime minister briefly during 1977, before becoming prime minister from 1984 to 1986. As foreign minister under Prime Minister Rabin, Peres engineered the 1994 Israel‚ÄìJordan peace treaty, and won the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize together with Rabin and Yasser Arafat for the Oslo Accords peace talks with the Palestinian leadership. In 1996, he founded the Peres Center for Peace, which has the aim of &quot;promot[ing] lasting peace and advancement in the Middle East by fostering tolerance, economic and technological development, cooperation and well-being.&quot; After suffering a stroke, Peres died in 2016 near Tel Aviv.

Shimon Peres was born Szymon Perski, on 2 August 1923, in Wiszniew, Poland (now Vishnyeva, Belarus), to Yitzhak (1896‚Äì1962) and Sara (1905‚Äì1969, n√©e Meltzer) Perski. The family spoke Hebrew, Yiddish and Russian at home, and Peres learned Polish at school. He then learned to speak English and French. His father was a wealthy timber merchant, later branching out into other commodities; his mother was a librarian. Peres had a younger brother, Gershon. He was related to the American film star Lauren Bacall (born Betty Joan Perske), and they were described as first cousins, but Peres said, &quot;In 1952 or 1953, I came to New York... Lauren Bacall called me, said that she wanted to meet, and we did. We sat and talked about where our families came from, and discovered that we were from the same family... but I&#x27;m not exactly sure what our relation is... It was she who later said that she was my cousin; I didn&#x27;t say that&quot;.
Peres told Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson that he had been born as a result of a blessing his parents had received from a chassidic rebbe and that he was proud of it. Peres&#x27;s grandfather, Rabbi Zvi Meltzer, a grandson of Rabbi Chaim Volozhin, had a great impact on his life. In an interview, Peres said: &quot;As a child, I grew up in my grandfather&#x27;s home. ‚Ä¶ I was educated by him. ‚Ä¶ My grandfather taught me Talmud. It was not as easy as it sounds. My home was not an observant one. My parents were not Orthodox but I was Haredi. At one point, I heard my parents listening to the radio on the Sabbath and I smashed it.&quot; When he was a child, Peres was taken by his father to Radun to receive a blessing from Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan (known as &quot;the &quot;Chofetz Chaim&quot;&quot;). As a child, Peres would later say, &quot;I did not dream of becoming president of Israel. My dream as a boy was to be a shepherd or a poet of stars.&quot; He inherited his love of French literature from his maternal grandfather.

In 1932, Peres&#x27;s father immigrated to Mandatory Palestine and settled in Tel Aviv. The family followed him in 1934. He attended Balfour Elementary School and High School, and Geula Gymnasium (High School for Commerce) in Tel Aviv. At 15, he transferred to Ben Shemen agricultural school and lived on Kibbutz Geva for several years. Peres was one of the founders of Kibbutz Alumot.

In 1941, he was elected Secretary of HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed, a Labor Zionist youth movement, and in 1944 returned to Alumot, where he had an agricultural training and worked as a farmer and a shepherd.

At age 20, he was elected to the HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed national secretariat, where he was only one of two Mapai party supporters, out of the 12 members. Three years later, he took over the movement and won a majority. The head of Mapai, David Ben-Gurion, and Berl Katznelson began to take an interest in him, and appointed him to Mapai&#x27;s secretariat.

In 1944, Peres led an illicit expedition into the Negev, then a closed military zone requiring a permit to enter. The expedition, consisting of a group of teenagers, along with a Palmach scout, a zoologist, and an archaeologist, had been funded by Ben-Gurion and planned by Palmach head Yitzhak Sadeh, as part of a plan for future Jewish settlement of the area so as to include it in the Jewish state. The group was arrested by a Bedouin camel patrol led by a British officer, taken to Beersheba (then a small Arab town) and incarcerated in the local jail. All of the participants were sentenced to two weeks in prison, and as the leader, Peres was also heavily fined. The expedition came across a nest of bearded vultures, called &quot;peres&quot; in Hebrew, and from this Peres took his Hebrew name.

All of Peres&#x27;s relatives who remained in Wiszniew in 1941 were murdered during the Holocaust, many of them (including Rabbi Meltzer) burned alive in the town&#x27;s synagogue.

In 1945, Peres married Sonya Gelman, who preferred to remain outside the public eye. They had three children.

In 1946, Peres and Moshe Dayan were chosen as the two youth delegates in the Mapai delegation to the Zionist Congress in Basel.

In 1947, Peres joined the Haganah, the predecessor of the Israel Defense Forces. David Ben-Gurion made him responsible for personnel and arms purchases; he was appointed to head the naval service when Israel received independence in 1948.

Peres was director of the Defense Ministry&#x27;s delegation in the United States in the early 1950s. While in the U.S. he studied English, economics, and philosophy at The New School and New York University, and completed a four-month advanced management course at Harvard University.

==Director General of Defense (1953-1959)==

In 1952, Peres was appointed deputy director general of the Ministry of Defense, and the following year, he was promoted to director general. At age 29, he was the youngest person to hold this position. He was involved in arms purchases and establishing strategic alliances that were important for the State of Israel. He was instrumental in establishing close relations with France, securing massive amounts of quality arms that, in turn, helped to tip the balance of power in the region.

In 1955, he testified against Minister of Defense Pinhas Lavon in what became known as the Lavon Affair.

Owing to Peres&#x27;s mediation, Israel acquired the advanced Dassault Mirage III French jet fighter, established the Dimona nuclear reactor and entered into a tri-national agreement with France and the United Kingdom, positioning Israel in what would become the 1956 Suez Crisis. Peres continued as a primary intermediary in the close French-Israeli alliance from the mid-1950s, although from 1958, he was often involved in tense negotiations with Charles de Gaulle over the Dimona project.

Peres is considered to have been the architect of Israel&#x27;s secret nuclear weapons program in the 1960s, and he stated that, in the 1960s, he recruited Arnon Milchan, an Israeli-American Hollywood film producer, billionaire businessman, and secret arms dealer and intelligence operative, to work for the Israeli Bureau of Scientific Relations (LEKEM or LAKAM), a secret intelligence organization tasked with obtaining military technology and science espionage.

=== 1956 Suez Crisis ===
From 1954, as director general of the Ministry of Defense, Peres was involved in the planning of the 1956 Suez War, in partnership with France and Britain. Peres was sent by David Ben-Gurion to Paris, where he held secret meetings with the French government. Peres was instrumental in negotiating the Franco-Israeli agreement for a military offensive. In November 1954, Peres visited Paris, where he was received by the French Defense Minister Marie-Pierre K≈ìnig, who told him that France would sell Israel any weapons it wanted to buy. By early 1955, France was shipping large amounts of weapons to Israel. In April 1956, following another visit to Paris by Peres, France agreed to disregard the Tripartite Declaration, and supply more weapons to Israel. During the same visit, Peres informed the French that Israel had decided upon war with Egypt in 1956. Throughout the 1950s, an extraordinarily close relationship existed between France and Israel, characterised by unprecedented cooperation in the fields of defense and diplomacy. For his work as the architect of this relationship, Peres was awarded the highest order of the French, the Legion of Honor, as Commander.

At S√®vres, Peres took part in planning alongside Maurice Bourg√®s-Maunoury, Christian Pineau and Chief of Staff of the French Armed Forces General Maurice Challe, and British Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd and his assistant Sir Patrick Dean. Britain and France enlisted Israeli support for an alliance against Egypt. The parties agreed that Israel would invade the Sinai. Britain and France would then intervene, purportedly to separate the warring Israeli and Egyptian forces, instructing both to withdraw to a distance of 16 kilometres from either side of the canal. The British and French would then argue, according to the plan, that Egypt&#x27;s control of such an important route was too tenuous, and that it needed be placed under Anglo-French management. The agreement at S√®vres was initially described by British Prime Minister Anthony Eden as the &quot;highest form of statesmanship&quot;. The three allies, especially Israel, were mainly successful in attaining their immediate military objectives. However, the extremely hostile reaction to the Suez Crisis from both the United States and the USSR forced them to withdraw, resulting in a failure of Britain and France&#x27;s political and strategic aims of controlling the Suez Canal.

==Early Knesset career (1959‚Äì1974)==
Peres was first elected to the Knesset in the 1959 elections as a member of the Mapai party. He was given the role of deputy minister of defense, which he filled until 1965 (holding this position in the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th governments of Israel under Prime Ministers David Ben-Gurion and Levi Eshkol). In this position, he held negotiations with John F. Kennedy, which concluded with the sale of Hawk anti-aircraft missiles to Israel, the first sale of US military equipment to Israel. Peres expressed great appreciation and praise for the American decision to sell Hawk missiles in a speech to the Knesset on 25 June 1963.

Peres resigned from the 12th government in late May 1965, citing the growing rift between Prime Minister Eshkol and former prime minister Ben-Gurion (Peres was aligned with Ben Gurion). In 1965, Peres and Moshe Dayan were among those that left Mapai with David Ben-Gurion when Ben-Gurion formed a new party, Rafi. Peres was a co-founder of the Rafi party. The party reconciled with Mapai in 1968, merging to form the Israeli Labor Party. The Labor Party then joined the Alignment (a left-wing alliance).

In 1969, Peres was appointed minister of immigrant absorption in the 15th government (led by Prime Minister Golda Meir), and in 1970 (also in the 15th government), he became minister of transportation and communications. After this, he served as minister of information in the Meir-led 16th government.

==Minister of Defense (1974‚Äì1977)==
Peres was appointed minister of defense in the Yitzhak Rabin-led 17th government, after having been Rabin&#x27;s chief rival for the post of Labor Party leader (and, in effect, the Israeli premiership) in the 1974 Israeli Labor Party leadership election that was held after Golda Meir resigned in the aftermath of the Yom Kippur War.

===1976 Entebbe rescue operation===
On 27 June 1976, Peres, as minister of defense, in collaboration with Prime Minister Rabin, handled Israel&#x27;s response to a coordinated act of terrorism when 248 Paris-bound travelers on an Air France plane were taken hostage by pro-Palestinian hijackers and flown to Uganda, Africa, 2,000 miles away.

Peres and Rabin were responsible for approving what became known as the &quot;Operation Entebbe&quot;, which took place on 4 July 1976. The rescue boosted the Rabin government&#x27;s approval rating with the public. The only Israeli soldier that was killed during the successful rescue operation was its commander, 30-year-old Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Netanyahu, older brother of Benjamin Netanyahu.

Before Rabin ultimately approved the rescue mission, he and Peres were at odds on how to proceed. Rabin was open to acquiescing to the terrorists&#x27; demands to release forty Palestinian militants if no military option presented itself. Peres, however, felt acquiescing to be a nonstarter, believing it would encourage further terrorism. Rabin initially took steps to begin negotiations with the terrorists, seeing no other option. Peres felt that negotiating with terrorists would, in effect, be a surrender, and thought a rescue operation should be planned.

Peres organized a secret Israel Crisis Committee to come up with a rescue plan. When a plan had been made, he met with commander Netanyahu a number of times. During one of their final private meetings, they both examined maps and went over precise details. Peres later said of Netanyahu&#x27;s explanation, &quot;My impression was one of exactitude and imagination,&quot; saying that Netanyahu seemed confident the operation would succeed with almost no losses. Netanyahu left the meeting understanding that Peres would do everything in his power to see that the operation went smoothly. Peres then went unannounced to Moshe Dayan, the former minister of Defense, interrupting his dinner with friends in a restaurant, to show him the latest plan to get his opinion. Peres told Dayan of the objections that had been raised by Rabin and Chief of Staff, Mordechai Gur. Dayan dismissed the objections after reviewing the written details: &quot;Shimon,&quot; he said, &quot;this is a plan that I support not one hundred percent but one hundred and fifty percent! There has to be a military operation.&quot; Peres later got the approval from Gur, who became fully supportive. Peres then took the plan to Rabin, who had been lukewarm and still didn&#x27;t like the risks, but he reluctantly approved the plan after Peres answered a number of key questions and Rabin learned that the cabinet had also endorsed it.

Shortly after the mission ended, Rabin recounted, &quot;we called into my office seven of our top commanders...I told our friends in uniform that the honor of the Jewish people, their destinies, are challenged and what we are considering is not just a calculated risk in the military sense, but a comparative risk, which exists between surrender to terror and daring rescue stemming from independence.&quot;

After the success of the operation, Peres angled to receive some of the credit and adulation, somewhat competing with Rabin for credit.

===Unsuccessful February 1977 campaign for Labor Party leader===
In February 1977, Peres challenged Prime Minister Rabin for the leadership of Labor Party, but lost to Rabin in a narrow 50.72% to 49.28% result in the vote by the party&#x27;s Central Committee. The leadership election was expected to determine who would lead the party into the 1977 Knesset election. This was at moment when Labor was threatened with the prospect of losing its control of government after 28-consecutive years due to the rise of both the right-wing Likud bloc and the centrist Democratic Movement for Change, which were seen as collectively cutting into the Labor Party&#x27;s support in the upcoming election. At the time, Rabin and Peres presented little policy difference, with Peres being seen as only slightly to the right of Rabin on domestic matters. Instead of positioning himself in contrast to the incumbent Rabin on policy, Peres instead capitalized off of the political atmosphere and staked his candidacy largely on an argument that the Labor Party needed to satisfy the nation&#x27;s desire for change by choosing a new leader for itself.

==Unofficial acting premiership (1977)==
On 7 April 1977, Prime Minister Rabin announced that, in the wake of a foreign currency scandal involving his wife, he would be stepping down prior to the 1977 Knesset election. Peres made himself a candidate to replace him as the new Labor Party leader. Initially, Foreign Minister Yigal Allon also made himself a candidate. However, Allon and Peres reached an agreement that Peres would appoint Allon to any ministerial position that Allon preferred in exchange from his withdrawal of his candidacy. Following Allon&#x27;s withdrawal, the Labor Party leadership announced on 10 April 1977 that he had chosen to endorse Peres as the party&#x27;s new leader. On 11 April 1977, the 815-member Central Committee of the party elected Peres by acclamation as the party&#x27;s new leader.

Rabin ended his active service as prime minister on 22 April 1977, and Peres became Israel&#x27;s unofficial acting prime minister. The reason why Peres was not officially the holder of this office was that Rabin could not, under Israeli law, resign from his position as prime minister because the government was, at the time, a caretaker government.

In his first election as party leader, Peres led Labor Party and the Alignment coalition to its first ever electoral defeat, and the result afforded the first-place Likud party (led by Menachem Begin) the ability to form a coalition that excluded the left. When the new Likud-led government was formed on 20 June 1977 Peres&#x27; time as the unofficial acting prime minister ended.

==Labor in opposition (1977‚Äì1984)==

Once the Likud-led government took power, Labor and the Alignment bloc entered the Knesset opposition for the first time in its history, and Peres assumed the unofficial role of Knesset opposition leader.

In 1978, Peres was elected vice president of Socialist International. Through his role within the leadership of this organization, Peres befriended foreign politicians including Willy Brandt, Bruno Kreisky, members of the British Labour Party, and politicians from parts of Africa and Asia.

After handily winning reelection as Labor Party leader in 1980 (defeating a challenge from Rabin, who was attempting a comeback to the leadership), Peres led his party to another, narrower, loss in the 1981 elections.

== Grand coalition governments and first premiership (1984‚Äì1988) ==
In the 1984 elections (Peres&#x27; third election as Labor Party leader), the Alignment coalition won more seats than any other party, but the left-wing failed to win the majority of 61 seats needed to form a coalition on their own. Alignment and Likud agreed to an unusual ‚Äúrotation&quot; arrangement to form a grand coalition unity government during which, for the first twenty-five months, Peres would serve as prime minister and the Likud leader Yitzhak Shamir would be foreign minister, with the two swapping positions thereafter for the second half of the term.

===First premiership (1984‚Äì1986)===

Peres was regarded to be a popular prime minister in his two years as premier under the rotation arrangement. During a portion of his premiership, he also held the position of minister of religious affairs.

====Military policy and international relations====
Among the most noteworthy moments of his first tenure as prime minister was Operation Wooden Leg (a long-range Israeli airstrike against the PLO headquarters in Tunisia) and a trip to Morocco to confer with King Hassan II.

In 1985, Peres publicly supported the quick pursuit of a military pullback from Beirut to Israel&#x27;s south Lebanon security belt. A partial Israeli pullback had earlier been approved in 1983 by the Begin-headed Likud-led government that had been in power at that time.

====1985 Israel Economic Stabilization Plan====

A major domestic policy decision of Peres&#x27; first premiership was the implementation of the 1985 Israel Economic Stabilization Plan.

By 1985, Israel&#x27;s economic fortunes were looking dire, with immense and quickly rising inflation (Israel was experiencing hyperinflation), a government budget deficit equal to between twelve and fifteen percent of the nation&#x27;s GDP and national debt equal to 220% of the nation&#x27;s GDP, and Israel&#x27;s foreign currency reserves were quickly dissipating. With the assistance of the government of the United States, Peres assembled a board of American economist to advise him on the situation. Conditional on him implementing reforms, Peres secured emergency economic assistance from the United States of $750 million (equivalent to 3.5% of the nation&#x27;s GDP at the time) annually over a two-year period.

Peres was initially hesitant to take the drastic measures that he ultimately would pursue, as they had the strong potential of proving unpopular and came with a risk of potentially creating a drastic increase in unemployment. Peres ultimately was convinced to push through the 1985 Israel Economic Stabilization Plan. Once convinced, he was assertive in pushing for the passage of the program, which was quickly after approved by his cabinet on 1 July 1985. This program had quick success in improving the course of the Israeli economy. By the end of the year, inflation immensely decreased. Additionally, the shekel stabilized and the government balanced its budget. While Israel would subsequently slide into a recession, the stabilization has been regarded as an important and greatly successful model for addressing economies in crisis, and has been credited with saving the nation&#x27;s economy.

===Minister of Foreign Affairs (1986‚Äì1988)===
As per the rotation arrangement, after Peres&#x27; two years as prime minister he and Shamir traded places in 1986. Shamir became prime minister of the new twenty-second government of Israel and Peres became foreign minister as well as the designated acting prime minister of Israel.

=== Minister of Finance (1988‚Äì1990) ===
In 1988 the Alignment, led by Peres, suffered another narrow defeat. This came despite the fact that polling in 1988 showed Peres to be the most popular politician in the nation. Peres agreed to renew the grand coalition with the Likud, this time conceding the premiership to Shamir for the entire term. In the grand coalition unity government of 1988‚Äì90 (the twenty-third government of Israel), Peres served as minister of finance and also continued to be the designated acting prime minister of Israel.

==Return to opposition (1990‚Äì1992)==
===&quot;The dirty trick&quot;===
Peres and the Alignment finally left the government in 1990, after &quot;the dirty trick&quot; ‚Äì a failed bid by Peres to form a narrow government based on a coalition of the Alignment, small leftist factions and ultra-orthodox parties. Peres&#x27; hope had been to create a Labor-led government that would be focused on peace talks with Palestine. Likud had declined proposals by the United States for Israel and Palestine to initiate what would have been the first peace talks between the two sides. Peres&#x27; longtime intra-party rival, Yizhak Rabin, had opposed to overthrowing the Likud-led coalition government. Peres succeeded in ending the government twenty-third government with a vote of no confidence. However, Peres was subsequently unable to assemble enough Knesset partners to form a pro-peace talk government. After two months, Shamir managed to form a Likud-led government with right-wing religious parties, establishing what was seen as the most conservative government coalition in the history of Israel up to that point.

===Defeat in the 1992 Labor Party leadership election===
Peres led the opposition in the Knesset from 1990 until early 1992, when he was defeated by Yitzhak Rabin in the Israeli Labor Party leadership election, the first leadership election held since the party formally merged with the other parties of Alignment, and the first leadership election open to participation by the party&#x27;s entire membership. Peres remained active in politics, however.

==Rabin government (1992‚Äì1995)==
After the Labor Party was successful in the 1992 Knesset election and Rabin became prime minister again, Peres became foreign minister in the Rabin-led twenty-fifth government of Israel. Peres had previously served as foreign minister from 1986 through 1988.

=== Israel‚ÄìJordan peace treaty ===

On 26 October 1994, Jordan and Israel signed the Israel‚ÄìJordan peace treaty, which had been initiated by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. The ceremony was held in the Arava valley of Israel, north of Eilat and near the Jordanian border. Prime Minister Rabin and Prime Minister Abdelsalam al-Majali signed the treaty and the President of Israel Ezer Weizman shook hands with King Hussein. United States President Bill Clinton observed, accompanied by United States Secretary of State Warren Christopher, as well as the foreign ministers of eleven other nations (including Russia, which had joined the United States as a formal co-sponsor of the peace talks that led to the treaty). The treaty brought an end to 46 years of official war between Israel and Jordan. It was only the second full peace agreement that Israel had reached with an Arab nation, after the Camp David Accords signed with Egypt in 1978.

===Oslo peace process with Palestine===

Rabin&#x27;s 1992 campaign for Labor had primarily been run on the idea of negotiating peace with the Palestinians. This campaign had succeeded as a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was popular among the Israeli public at the time. The twenty-fifth government of Israel was arguably more pro-peace government than any previous Israeli government. It would begin negotiations with the Yasser Arafat-led Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).

Peres was involved in secret peace negotiations between Prime Minister Rabin&#x27;s government and Arafat&#x27;s PLO organization. These negotiations were held over several months in 1992 and 1993. As part of the negotiations, Peres secretly flew to Oslo, Norway on 19 August 1993. The ultimate agreement outlined a peace process between Israel and Palestine, which would include the establishment of an interim Palestinian government within both the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. On 13 September 1993, Peres signed the initial Oslo I Accord on behalf of the Israeli government in a ceremony at the United States&#x27; White House, with Rabin in attendance.
In 1994, in recognition of the Oslo Accords, Peres, Rabin and Arafat were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. This was the second (and most recent) instance in which an Israeli was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Then-Prime Minister Menachem Begin had previously jointly received the honor with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1978. This was also the second time that the award had been given in recognition of middle east peacemaking efforts, with the 1978 award having been the previous instance of this. The awarding of the prize to the three has not been without controversy. After it was decided they would be given the award, K√•re Kristiansen resigned from the Nobel Peace Prize committee in protest of Arafat receiving the award, believing Arafat to be, &quot;too tainted by violence, terror and torture&quot;. In 2002, a number of members of the Norwegian committee that awards the annual Nobel Peace Prize would state they regretted that Mr. Peres&#x27;s prize could not be recalled. Because he had not acted to prevent Israel&#x27;s re-occupation of Palestinian territory, he had not lived up to the ideals he expressed when he accepted the prize, and he was involved in human rights abuses.

Negotiations on further terms continued, with Peres continuing to be an integral player. On 28 September 1995, Rabin and Arafat jointly signed a second major agreement, which has popularly been referred to as &quot;Oslo II&quot;.

==Second premiership (1995‚Äì1996)==


While the Oslo peace policies, at the time, enjoyed the support of most Israelis, they also faced intense opposition from extreme members of Israel‚Äôs right-wing. In response to intense street protests by right-wing opponents of the Oslo peace process, a coalition of left-wing parties and peace groups organized a rally in support of the peace process in Tel Aviv&#x27;s Kings Square on 4 November 1995, which both Prime Minister Rabin and Peres attended. While making his way from the stage to his car after concluding his speech to the gathered crowd of more than 100,000 people, Rabin was assassinated by Yigal Amir, a right-wing Israeli Jew who opposed the peace process.

After Rabin&#x27;s assassination, Peres was made acting prime minister and acting defense minister of a provisional government. On 14 November 1995, the Labor Party confirmed Peres as its new leader, which thereby cleared the last formality before he could be invited by President Ezer Weizman to form a new government. On 15 November 1995, Peres was invited by to form a new government. On 21 November, Peres signed a coalition agreement between Labor, Meretz and Yiud (which had been members of Rabin&#x27;s government), which was formally approved by the Knesset the next day, establishing a new government with Peres as prime minister.

Peres&#x27; second stint as prime minister ultimately lasted a total of seven months. During this time, he attempted to maintain the momentum of the peace process.

On 10 February 1996, Peres made the widely expected announcement that he would call early elections, moving the elections to late May, five months earlier than they otherwise were to be held. The election would be the first to use a new system in which the prime minister was directly elected in a vote coinciding with the Knesset election. Peres had hoped that early elections would deliver a mandate for his pursuit of a two-state solution. Peres had called the elections early because of promising polls. He was heavily leading in the polls for the prime minister vote at the time the election was called, with polls showing him to have between a twenty and twenty-five percent lead. Additionally, Labor was also leading in polls for the Knesset vote. Despite the promising polls, however, some in Labor had, even at this time, expressed concerns about the ability of Peres to win, given his failure to deliver an outright win for the Labor Party during his earlier stint as party leader. His lead in the polls began to decrease after the Jaffa Road bus bombings on 25 February 1996. However, even in the last month before the election, he enjoyed a reduced leading margin of around five percent.

On 11 April 1996, Peres initiated Operation Grapes of Wrath, which was triggered by Hezbollah Katyusha rockets fired into Israel in response to the killing of two Lebanese by an IDF missile. Israel conducted massive air raids and extensive shelling in southern Lebanon. 106 Lebanese civilians died in the shelling of Qana, when a UN compound was hit in an Israeli shelling.

During his term, Peres promoted the use of the internet in Israel and created the first website of an Israeli prime minister.

==Post-premiership (1996‚Äì2007)==
===Labor in opposition (1996‚Äì1999)===
Peres was narrowly defeated by Benjamin Netanyahu in the 1996 Israeli prime ministerial election. Not included in the new government, Labor became an opposition party again. This again placed Peres in the then-unofficial role of Knesset opposition leader.

In 1996, Peres founded the Peres Center for Peace, which has the aim of &quot;promot[ing] lasting peace and advancement in the Middle East by fostering tolerance, economic and technological development, cooperation and well-being.&quot;

Peres did not seek re-election as Labor Party leader in 1997 and was replaced by Ehud Barak that year. Barak rebuffed Peres&#x27; attempt to secure the position of party president.

===Minister of Regional Cooperation (1999‚Äì2001)===
In 1999, Ehud Barak was elected prime minister and formed a Labor-lead government. He appointed Peres (who was seen as a political rival of Barak) to the minor post of minister of regional cooperation. The position was vaguely defined, being expected to be tasked with advancing economic and political ties between Israel and the Arab world. The position also did not come with any government funding. Peres accepted the relatively low-ranked position reluctantly. For nearly all of time in this position Peres was sidelined, finding himself disallowed from playing a major role within the government.

On 1 November 2000, amid the Second Intifada, Peres met in the Gaza Strip with Arafat on behalf of the Israeli government. The two agreed to terms of a truce in the early hours of the following morning.

After the resignation of Ezer Weizman, Peres ran in the 2000 Israeli presidential election, seeking to be elected by members of the Knesset to a seven-year term as Israel&#x27;s president (a ceremonial head of state position which usually authorizes the selection of Prime Minister). However, he lost to Likud candidate Moshe Katsav. Katsav&#x27;s victory was regarded to be in reaction to the perceived indications that Peres intended to use the presidency to provide his support to the increasingly unpopular peace processes that Barak&#x27;s government was pursuing. His defeat was considered a significant upset, as he had been regarded as a heavy front-runner to win the Knesset vote. The editorial board of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that his defeat appeared to spell the end of Peres&#x27; long political career.

There was consideration given later that year to Peres potentially seeking the premiership again. On 20 November 2000, amid polls showing him to be in a virtual-tie with Ariel Sharon, an aide of Peres told the media that he would run in the 2001 direct election for prime minister. Peres himself told lawmakers that he intended to run. Despite this, Peres did not become a candidate. In January 2001, there was some talk among Cabinet members that it would be best for Peres to be the candidate of the left.
 However, this did not happen. In early January 2001, in a joint television appearance with Barak that promoted the government&#x27;s intent to work towards peace, Peres told the media that his own goal was, &quot;not to become prime minister&quot;, but was instead, &quot;to do the best for the state of Israel.&quot;

===Minister of Foreign Affairs (2001‚Äì2002)===
Following Barak&#x27;s defeat by Ariel Sharon in the 2001 direct election for prime minister, Peres made yet another comeback. He helped with bringing Labor into a grand coalition unity government with Sharon&#x27;s Likud (the Twenty-ninth government of Israel) and secured himself the post of foreign minister. In 2001, formal leadership of Labor passed to Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, and in 2002 it was passed to Amram Mitzna. Peres grew to be heavily criticized by many on the left, who accused him of clinging to his position as foreign minister in a government that was not seen as advancing the peace process. Left critics accused Peres of not acting in accordance with his own dovish stance. Peres resigned from his post as foreign minister when Labor left the unity government in advance of the 2003 Knesset election. Labor&#x27;s departure from the unity government placed Labor in the opposition ahead of the 2003 Knesset election.

===Interim Labor Party leader (2003‚Äì2005)===
After the Labor Party suffered a crushing defeat in the 2003 Knesset election while under the leadership of Mitzna, Peres was made interim leader of the party on 19 June 2003.

====Vice Prime Minister (2005)====
Peres led the Labor Party into a coalition with Sharon once more, reaching an agreement the end of 2004, and entering the party into the thirtieth government of Israel in January 2005. This came after the Sharon&#x27;s support of &quot;disengagement&quot; from Gaza presented a diplomatic program that Labor could support. Sharon made Peres vice prime minister.
As interim party leader, Peres favored putting off the elections for as long as possible. He claimed that an early election would jeopardize both the September 2005 Gaza withdrawal plan and the standing of the party in a national unity government with Sharon. However, the majority pushed for an earlier date, as younger members of the party, among them Amir Peretz, Ophir Pines-Paz and Isaac Herzog, overtook established leaders such as Binyamin Ben-Eliezer and Haim Ramon in the party ballot to divide up government portfolios.

===Loss of Labor Party leadership and defection to Kadima===
Peres lost a bid for permanent leadership of the Labor Party to Amir Peretz in the November 2005 leadership election, held in advance of the 2006 elections. Peres received 40% of the vote to Peretz&#x27;s 42.4%.

Labor withdrew from the unity government on 23 November 2005. On 30 November 2005 Peres announced that he was leaving the Labor Party to support Ariel Sharon and his new Kadima party. In the immediate aftermath of Sharon&#x27;s debilitating stroke days later (which left Sharon in a coma), there was speculation that Peres might take over as leader of the Kadima party; most senior Kadima leaders, however, were former members of Likud and indicated their support for Ehud Olmert as Sharon&#x27;s successor. Labor reportedly tried to woo Peres to rejoin them. However, he announced that he supported Olmert and would remain with Kadima. Peres had previously announced his intention not to run in the March 2006 elections, but changed his mind.

Peres resigned from the Knesset on 15 January 2006 due both to Attorney General Menahem Mazuz issuing a decision that ruled Peres and several others could not be appointed to ministerial posts by Prime Minister Olmert and because of a law that, due to him having switched parties, would have prevented him from running for the next Knesset if he remained an incumbent member of the Knesset. By that time, he had served in the Knesset for more than forty-six consecutive years.

Peres was soon elected back to the Knesset in the 2006 election, this time as a member of Kadima. After the new Kadima-led thirty-first government was formed, Peres was given the role of vice prime minister and minister for the development of the Negev, Galilee and Regional Economy.

==Presidency (2007‚Äì2014)==


On 13 June 2007, Peres was elected president of the State of Israel by the Knesset. 58 of 120 members of the Knesset voted for him in the first round (whereas 38 voted for Reuven Rivlin, and 21 for Colette Avital). His opponents then backed Peres in the second round and 86 members of the Knesset voted in his favor, while 23 objected. He resigned from his role as a member of the Knesset the same day, having been a member since November 1959 (except for a three-month period in early 2006), the longest serving in Israeli political history. Peres was sworn in as president on 15 July 2007.


On 20 November 2008, Peres received an honorary knighthood, Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George from Queen Elizabeth II in Buckingham Palace in London.

In June 2011, he was awarded the honorary title of &quot;sheikh&quot; by Bedouin dignitaries in Hura for his efforts to achieve Middle East peace. Peres thanks his hosts by saying &quot;This visit has been a pleasure. I am deeply impressed by Hura. You have done more for yourselves than anyone else could have&quot;. He told the Mayor of Hura, Dr. Muhammad Al-Nabari, and members of Hura&#x27;s governing council, that they were &quot;part of the Negev. It cannot be developed without developing the Bedouin community, so that it may keep its traditions while joining the modern world.&quot;

== Post-presidency and death ==
Peres announced in April 2013 that he would not seek to extend his tenure beyond 2014. His successor, Reuven Rivlin, was elected on 10 June 2014 and took office on 24 July 2014.

In July 2016, Peres founded the &#x27;Israel innovation center&#x27; in the Arab neighbourhood of Ajami, Jaffa, aiming to encourage young people from around the world to be inspired by technology.

On 13 September 2016, Peres suffered a severe stroke and was hospitalized at Sheba Medical Center. His condition was reported to be very serious, as he had suffered a massive brain hemorrhage and significant bleeding. Two days later, he was reported as being in a serious but stable condition. However, on 26 September, an examination found irreversible damage to his brainstem, indicating that it was not possible for him to recover, and the following day, his medical condition deteriorated significantly. He died on 28 September at the age of 93.

=== Tributes ===
On hearing of his death, tributes came from leaders across the world. The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin said: &quot;I was extremely lucky to have met this extraordinary man many times. And every time I admired his courage, patriotism, wisdom, vision and ability.&quot; The President of China, Xi Jinping said: &quot;His death is the loss of an old friend for China.&quot; The President of India, Pranab Mukherjee said: &quot;Peres would be remembered as a steadfast friend of India.&quot; The President of the United States, Barack Obama said: &quot;I will always be grateful that I was able to call Shimon my friend.&quot;

Peres was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as having done &quot;more than anyone to build up his country&#x27;s formidable military might, then [having] worked as hard to establish a lasting peace with Israel&#x27;s Arab neighbors.&quot;

=== Funeral ===

The funeral was held at Mount Herzl in Jerusalem on 30 September 2016, with his burial place in the Great Leaders of the Nation section between former Israeli Prime Ministers Yitzhak Rabin and Yitzhak Shamir.

About 4,000 mourners and world leaders from 75 countries attended the funeral, with President Barack Obama among those who gave a eulogy. Since the funeral for Nelson Mandela, this was only the second time Obama traveled overseas for the funeral of a foreign leader. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also spoke. Among the other delegates in attendance and speaking were former President Bill Clinton. Other delegates included PA President Mahmoud Abbas, President Fran√ßois Hollande of France, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, German President Joachim Gauck, President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto of Mexico and King Felipe VI of Spain. The UK delegation included Prince Charles, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, former Prime Ministers David Cameron, Gordon Brown, and Tony Blair, and Britain&#x27;s chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis.

==Political views==
Peres described himself as a &quot;Ben-Gurionist&quot;, after his mentor Ben-Gurion. He felt that Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel was a means to a progressive end in which the State of Israel both inspire the world and survive in a region of the world where it was unwelcome.

As a younger man, Peres was once considered a &quot;hawk&quot;. He was a prot√©g√© of Ben-Gurion and Dayan and an early supporter of the West Bank settlers during the 1970s. However, after becoming the leader of his party his stance evolved. Subsequently, he was seen as a dove, and a strong supporter of peace through economic cooperation. While still opposed, like all mainstream Israeli leaders in the 1970s and early 1980s, to talks with the PLO, he distanced himself from settlers and spoke of the need for &quot;territorial compromise&quot; over the West Bank and Gaza. For a time he hoped that King Hussein of Jordan could be Israel&#x27;s Arab negotiating partner rather than Yasser Arafat. Peres met secretly with Hussein in London in 1987 and reached a framework agreement with him, but this was rejected by Israel&#x27;s then Prime Minister, Yitzhak Shamir. Shortly afterward the First Intifada erupted, and whatever plausibility King Hussein had as a potential Israeli partner in resolving the fate of the West Bank evaporated. Subsequently, Peres gradually moved closer to support for talks with the PLO, although he avoided making an outright commitment to this policy until 1993.

Peres was perhaps more closely associated with the Oslo Accords than any other Israeli politician (Rabin included) with the possible exception of his own prot√©g√©, Yossi Beilin. He remained an adamant supporter of the Oslo Accords and the Palestinian Authority since their inception despite the First Intifada and the al-Aqsa Intifada (Second Intifada). However, Peres supported Ariel Sharon&#x27;s military policy of operating the Israeli Defense Forces to thwart suicide bombings.

Peres&#x27;s foreign policy outlook was markedly realist. To placate Turkey, Peres downplayed the Armenian genocide. Peres stated: &quot;We reject attempts to create a similarity between the Holocaust and the Armenian allegations. Nothing similar to the Holocaust occurred. It is a tragedy what the Armenians went through but not a genocide.&quot; Although Peres himself did not retract the statement, the Israeli Foreign Ministry later issued a cable to its missions which stated that &quot;The minister absolutely did not say, as the Turkish news agency alleged, &#x27;What the Armenians underwent was a tragedy, not a genocide.&#x27;&quot; However, according to Armenian news agencies, the statement released by the Israeli consulate in Los Angeles did not include any mention that Peres had not said that the events were not genocide.

On the issue of the nuclear program of Iran and the supposed existential threat this poses for Israel, Peres stated, &quot;I am not in favor of a military attack on Iran, but we must quickly and decisively establish a strong, aggressive coalition of nations that will impose painful economic sanctions on Iran&quot;, adding &quot;Iran&#x27;s efforts to achieve nuclear weapons should keep the entire world from sleeping soundly.&quot; In the same speech, Peres compared Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his call to &quot;wipe Israel off the map&quot; to the genocidal threats to European Jewry made by Adolf Hitler in the years prior to the Holocaust. In an interview with Army Radio on 8 May 2006 he remarked that &quot;the president of Iran should remember that Iran can also be wiped off the map.&quot; However, after his death it was revealed that Peres had said that he prevented a military strike on Iran&#x27;s nuclear program that had been ordered by Benjamin Netanyahu and Ehud Barak in 2010.

Peres was a proponent of Middle East economic integration.

=== Technology ===

Peres is regarded as one of the founders of Israel&#x27;s technology sector. Through personal meetings with the French government, he established collaboration treaties with France&#x27;s nuclear industry in 1954. In 1958, he founded the re-organized RAFAEL Armament Development Authority, under the MOD&#x27;s jurisdiction. From his desk he would control all aspects of Israel&#x27;s nuclear program (first as director general and after 1959 as deputy minister). In the 1980s, he is credited with having laid the economic foundations for Israel&#x27;s start-up economy. In later years, he developed an obsessive fascination with nanotechnology and brain research. He believed that brain research would be the key to a better and more peaceful future. He launched his own nanotechnology investment fund in 2003, raising $5 million in the first week. In 2016, he founded the &#x27;Israel innovation center&#x27; in the Arab neighbourhood of Ajami, Jaffa. The center aims to encourage young people from around the world to be inspired by technology. Laying its foundation stone on 21 July 2016, Peres said: ‚ÄúWe will prove that innovation has no limits and no barriers. Innovation enables dialogue between nations and between people. It will enable all young people ‚Äì Jews, Muslims and Christians ‚Äî to engage in science and technology equally.&quot;

==Personal life and family==
In May 1945, Peres married Sonya Gelman, whom he had met in the Ben Shemen Youth Village, where her father served as a carpentry teacher. The couple married after Sonya finished her military service as a truck driver in the British Army during World War II. Through the years Sonya chose to stay away from the media and keep her privacy and the privacy of her family, despite her husband&#x27;s extensive political career. Sonya Peres was unable to attend Shimon&#x27;s 2007 presidential inauguration ceremony because of ill health. With the election of Peres for president, Sonya Peres, who had not wanted her husband to accept the position, announced that she would stay in the couple&#x27;s apartment in Tel Aviv and not join her husband in Jerusalem. The couple thereafter lived separately. She died on 20 January 2011, aged 87, from heart failure at her apartment in Tel Aviv.

Shimon and Sonya Peres had three children. Their eldest child was a daughter, Dr. Tsvia (&quot;Tsiki&quot;) Walden, who became a linguist and professor at Beit Berl Academic College. Their middle child was a son, Yoni, who became director of Village Veterinary Center, a veterinary hospital on the campus of Kfar Hayarok Agricultural School near Tel Aviv. He specializes in the treatment of guide dogs. Their youngest child, Nehemia (&quot;Chemi&quot;), became co-founder and managing general partner of Pitango Venture Capital, one of Israel&#x27;s largest venture capital funds. Chemi Peres is a former helicopter pilot in the IAF.

Peres was a cousin of actress Lauren Bacall (born Betty Joan Persky), although the two only discovered their relation to each other in the 1950s. Recalling this, Peres once remarked, &quot;In 1952 or 1953 I came to New York... Lauren Bacall called me, said that she wanted to meet, and we did. We sat and talked about where our families came from, and discovered that we were from the same family&quot;.

Peres was a polyglot, speaking Polish, French, English, Russian, Yiddish, and Hebrew. He never lost his Polish accent when speaking in Hebrew.

===Poetry and song-writing===
Peres was a lifelong writer of poetry and songs. As a child in Vishnyeva, Poland he learned to play the mandolin. He wrote his first song when he was 8. He was inspired to write, including during cabinet meetings. Peres was noted to sometimes write stanzas during Cabinet meetings. As a result of his deep literary interests, he could quote from Hebrew prophets, French literature, and Chinese philosophy with equal ease. Many of his poems were turned into songs, with the proceedings of the albums going to charity. His songs have been performed by artists including Andrea Bocelli and Liel Kolet. The most recent of his songs was &quot;Chinese Melody&quot; (recorded in Mandarin with Chinese and Israeli musicians), released in February 2016, which he wrote to celebrate the Year of the Monkey (Music Video of &#x27;Chinese Melody&#x27; on YouTube).

=== Use of social media ===
During his presidency (2007‚Äì2014), Shimon Peres was noted for his embrace of social media to communicate with the public, being described as &quot;Israel&#x27;s first social media president&quot;, which included producing comedic videos on his YouTube channel such as &quot;Be my Friend for Peace&quot; and &quot;Former Israeli President Shimon Peres Goes Job Hunting&quot;. After retirement, he led a viral campaign to encourage children to study mathematics. In one video, he sends his answer to the teacher by throwing a paper plane (Video: Shimon Peres throws a paper airplane in the name of education on YouTube). According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, his presence on platforms such as Snapchat, allowed him to &quot;pack more punch‚Äîand humor‚Äîinto the causes he championed, especially peaceful coexistence with the Palestinians.&quot;

== Places named after Peres ==

Following his death, it was announced that Israel&#x27;s Negev nuclear reactor and atomic research center, that had been constructed in 1958, would be named after Peres. Netanyahu stated: &quot;Shimon Peres worked hard to establish this important facility, a facility which has been very important for Israel&#x27;s security for generations..&quot;

<doc id="48570" wikidata="Q154934" url="?curid=48570" title="Ecgberht, King of Wessex">
<text>Ecgberht (770/775¬†‚Äì 839), also spelled Egbert, Ecgbert, Ecgbriht, Ecgbeorht, and Ecbert, was King of Wessex from 802 until his death in 839. His father was King Ealhmund of Kent. In the 780s, Ecgberht was forced into exile to Charlemagne&#x27;s court in the Frankish Empire by the kings Offa of Mercia and Beorhtric of Wessex, but on Beorhtric&#x27;s death in 802, Ecgberht returned and took the throne.

Little is known of the first 20 years of Ecgberht&#x27;s reign, but it is thought that he was able to maintain the independence of Wessex against the kingdom of Mercia, which at that time dominated the other southern English kingdoms. In 825, Ecgberht defeated Beornwulf of Mercia, ended Mercian Supremacy at the Battle of Ellandun, and proceeded to take control of the Mercian dependencies in southeastern England. In 829, he defeated Wiglaf of Mercia and drove him out of his kingdom, temporarily ruling Mercia directly. Later that year Ecgberht received the submission of the Northumbrian king at Dore. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; subsequently described Ecgberht as a &quot;bretwalda&quot; or &#x27;wide-ruler&#x27; of Anglo-Saxon lands.

Ecgberht was unable to maintain this dominant position, and within a year Wiglaf regained the throne of Mercia. However, Wessex did retain control of Kent, Sussex, and Surrey; these territories were given to Ecgberht&#x27;s son √Üthelwulf to rule as a subking under Ecgberht. When Ecgberht died in 839, √Üthelwulf succeeded him; the southeastern kingdoms were finally absorbed into the kingdom of Wessex after the death of √Üthelwulf&#x27;s son √Üthelbald in 860. Ecgbert&#x27;s descendants ruled Wessex and, later, all of England continuously until 1013.

== Family ==
Historians do not agree on Ecgberht&#x27;s ancestry. The earliest version of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,&quot; the &quot;Parker Chronicle,&quot; begins with a genealogical preface tracing the ancestry of Ecgberht&#x27;s son √Üthelwulf back through Ecgberht, Ealhmund (thought to be king Ealhmund of Kent), and the otherwise unknown Eafa and Eoppa to Ingild, brother of King Ine of Wessex, who abdicated the throne in 726. It continues back to Cerdic, founder of the House of Wessex. Ecgberht&#x27;s descent from Ingild was accepted by Frank Stenton, but not the earlier genealogy back to Cerdic. Heather Edwards in her &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; article on Ecgberht argues that he was of Kentish origin and that the West Saxon descent may have been manufactured during his reign to give him legitimacy, whereas Rory Naismith considered a Kentish origin unlikely, and that it is more probable that &quot;Ecgberht was born of good West Saxon royal stock&quot;.

Ecgberht&#x27;s wife&#x27;s name is unknown. A fifteenth-century chronicle now held by Oxford University names her as Redburga, supposedly a relative of Charlemagne whom he married when he was banished to Francia, but this is dismissed by academic historians in view of its late date. √Üthelwulf is their only known child.

He is reputed to have had a half-sister Alburga, later to be recognised as a saint for her founding of Wilton Abbey. She was married to Wulfstan, ealdorman of Wiltshire, and on his death in 802 she became a nun, Abbess of Wilton Abbey.

== Political context and early life ==
Offa of Mercia, who reigned from 757 to 796, was the dominant force in Anglo-Saxon England in the second half of the eighth century. The relationship between Offa and Cynewulf, who was king of Wessex from 757 to 786, is not well documented, but it seems likely that Cynewulf maintained some independence from Mercian overlordship. Evidence of the relationship between kings can come from charters, which were documents which granted land to followers or to churchmen, and which were witnessed by the kings who had the power to grant the land. In some cases a king will appear on a charter as a &quot;subregulus&quot;, or &quot;subking&quot;, making it clear that he has an overlord. Cynewulf appears as &quot;King of the West Saxons&quot; on a charter of Offa&#x27;s in 772, and in 779, he was defeated in battle of Bensington by Offa, but there is nothing else to suggest Cynewulf was not his own master, and he is not known to have acknowledged Offa as overlord. Offa did have influence in the southeast of the country: a charter of 764 shows him in the company of Heahberht of Kent, suggesting that Offa&#x27;s influence helped place Heahberht on the throne. The extent of Offa&#x27;s control of Kent between 765 and 776 is a matter of debate amongst historians, but from 776 until about 784 it appears that the Kentish kings had substantial independence from Mercia.

Another Ecgberht, Ecgberht II of Kent, ruled in that kingdom throughout the 770s; he is last mentioned in 779, in a charter granting land at Rochester. In 784 a new king of Kent, Ealhmund, appears in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. According to a note in the margin, &quot;this king Ealhmund was Egbert&#x27;s father [i.e. Ecgberht of Wessex], Egbert was √Üthelwulf&#x27;s father&quot;. This is supported by the genealogical preface from the A text of the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, which gives Ecgberht&#x27;s father&#x27;s name as Ealhmund without further details. The preface probably dates from the late ninth century; the marginal note is on the F manuscript of the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, which is a Kentish version dating from about 1100.

Ealhmund does not appear to have long survived in power: there is no record of his activities after 784. There is, however, the extensive evidence of Offa&#x27;s domination of Kent during the late 780s, with his goals apparently going beyond overlordship to outright annexation of the kingdom, and he has been described as &quot;the rival, not the overlord, of the Kentish kings&quot;. It is possible that the young Ecgberht fled to Wessex in 785 or so; it is suggestive that the &quot;Chronicle&quot; mentions in a later entry that Beorhtric, Cynewulf&#x27;s successor, helped Offa to exile Ecgberht.

Cynewulf was murdered in 786. His succession was contested by Ecgberht, but he was defeated by Beorhtric, maybe with Offa&#x27;s assistance. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records that Ecgberht spent three years in Francia before he was king, exiled by Beorhtric and Offa. The text says &quot;iii&quot; for three, but this may have been a scribal error, with the correct reading being &quot;xiii&quot;, which is thirteen years. Beorhtric&#x27;s reign lasted sixteen years, and not thirteen; and all extant texts of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; agree on &quot;iii&quot;, but many modern accounts assume that Ecgberht did indeed spend thirteen years in Francia. This requires assuming that the error in transcription is common to every manuscript of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;; many historians make this assumption but others have rejected it as unlikely, given the consistency of the sources. In either case Ecgberht was probably exiled in 789, when Beorhtric, his rival, married the daughter of Offa of Mercia.

At the time Ecgberht was in exile, Francia was ruled by Charlemagne, who maintained Frankish influence in Northumbria and is known to have supported Offa&#x27;s enemies in the south. Another exile in Gaul at this time was Odberht, a priest, who is almost certainly the same person as Eadberht, who later became king of Kent. According to a later chronicler, William of Malmesbury, Ecgberht learned the arts of government during his time in Gaul.

== Early reign ==
Beorhtric&#x27;s dependency on Mercia continued into the reign of Cenwulf, who became king of Mercia a few months after Offa&#x27;s death. Beorhtric died in 802, and Ecgberht came to the throne of Wessex, probably with the support of Charlemagne and perhaps also the papacy. The Mercians continued to oppose Ecgberht: the day of his accession, the Hwicce (who had originally formed a separate kingdom, but by that time were part of Mercia) attacked, under the leadership of their ealdorman, √Üthelmund. Weohstan, a Wessex ealdorman, met him with men from Wiltshire; according to a 15th-century source, Weohstan had married Alburga, Ecgberht&#x27;s sister, and so was his brother-in-law. The Hwicce were defeated, though Weohstan was killed as well as √Üthelmund. Nothing more is recorded of Ecgberht&#x27;s relations with Mercia for more than twenty years after this battle. It seems likely that Ecgberht had no influence outside his own borders, but on the other hand, there is no evidence that he ever submitted to the overlordship of Cenwulf. Cenwulf did have overlordship of the rest of southern England, but in Cenwulf&#x27;s charters the title of &quot;overlord of the southern English&quot; never appears, presumably in consequence of the independence of the kingdom of Wessex.

In 815, &quot;The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records that Ecgberht ravaged the whole of the territories of the remaining British kingdom, Dumnonia, known to the author of &quot;The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; as the West Welsh; their territory was about equivalent to what is now Cornwall. Ten years later, a charter dated 19 August 825 indicates that Ecgberht was campaigning in Dumnonia again; this may have been related to a battle recorded in the &quot;Chronicle&quot; at Gafulford in 823, between the men of Devon and the Britons of Cornwall.

== Battle of Ellandun ==
It was also in 825 that one of the most important battles in Anglo-Saxon history took place, when Ecgberht defeated Beornwulf of Mercia at Ellandun‚Äînow Wroughton, near Swindon. This battle marked the end of the Mercian domination of southern England. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; tells how Ecgberht followed up his victory: &quot;Then he sent his son √Üthelwulf from the army, and Ealhstan, his bishop, and Wulfheard, his ealdorman, to Kent with a great troop.&quot; √Üthelwulf drove Baldred, the king of Kent, north over the Thames, and according to the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, the men of Kent, Essex, Surrey and Sussex then all submitted to √Üthelwulf &quot;because earlier they were wrongly forced away from his relatives&quot;. This may refer to Offa&#x27;s interventions in Kent at the time Ecgberht&#x27;s father Ealhmund became king; if so, the chronicler&#x27;s remark may also indicate Ealhmund had connections elsewhere in southeast England.

The &quot;Chronicle&quot;‚Ä≥s version of events makes it appear that Baldred was driven out shortly after the battle, but this was probably not the case. A document from Kent survives which gives the date, March 826, as being in the third year of the reign of Beornwulf. This makes it likely that Beornwulf still had authority in Kent at this date, as Baldred&#x27;s overlord; hence Baldred was apparently still in power. In Essex, Ecgberht expelled King Sigered, though the date is unknown. It may have been delayed until 829 since a later chronicler associates the expulsion with a campaign of Ecgberht&#x27;s in that year against the Mercians.

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; does not say who was the aggressor at Ellandun, but one recent history asserts that Beornwulf was almost certainly the one who attacked. According to this view, Beornwulf may have taken advantage of the Wessex campaign in Dumnonia in the summer of 825. Beornwulf&#x27;s motivation to launch an attack would have been the threat of unrest or instability in the southeast: the dynastic connections with Kent made Wessex a threat to Mercian dominance.

The consequences of Ellandun went beyond the immediate loss of Mercian power in the southeast. According to the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, the East Anglians asked for Ecgberht&#x27;s protection against the Mercians in the same year, 825, though it may actually have been in the following year that the request was made. In 826 Beornwulf invaded East Anglia, presumably to recover his overlordship. He was slain, however, as was his successor, Ludeca, who invaded East Anglia in 827, evidently for the same reason. It may be that the Mercians were hoping for support from Kent: there was some reason to suppose that Wulfred, the Archbishop of Canterbury, might be discontented with West Saxon rule, as Ecgberht had terminated Wulfred&#x27;s currency and had begun to mint his own, at Rochester and Canterbury, and it is known that Ecgberht seized property belonging to Canterbury. The outcome in East Anglia was a disaster for the Mercians, which confirmed West Saxon power in the southeast.

== Defeat of Mercia ==
In 829 Ecgberht invaded Mercia and drove Wiglaf, the king of Mercia, into exile. This victory gave Ecgberht control of the London Mint, and he issued coins as King of Mercia. It was after this victory that the West Saxon scribe described him as a &quot;bretwalda&quot;, meaning &#x27;wide-ruler&#x27; or perhaps &#x27;Britain-ruler&#x27;, in a famous passage in &quot;The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. The relevant part of the annal reads, in the C manuscript of the &quot;Chronicle&quot;:

&quot;‚Åä √æy geare geeode Ecgbriht cing Myrcna rice ‚Åä eall √æ√¶t be su√æan Humbre w√¶s, ‚Åä he w√¶s eahta√æa cing se √∞e Bretenanwealda w√¶s.&quot;

In modern English:

And the same year King Egbert conquered the kingdom of Mercia, and all that was south of the Humber, and he was the eighth king who was &#x27;Wide-ruler&#x27;.

The previous seven &quot;bretwaldas&quot; are also named by the Chronicler, who gives the same seven names that Bede lists as holding &quot;imperium&quot;, starting with √Ülle of Sussex and ending with Oswiu of Northumbria. The list is often thought to be incomplete, omitting as it does some dominant Mercian kings such as Penda and Offa. The exact meaning of the title has been much debated; it has been described as &quot;a term of encomiastic poetry&quot; but there is also evidence that it implied a definite role of military leadership.

Later in 829, according to &quot;The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, Ecgberht received the submission of the Northumbrians at Dore (now a suburb of Sheffield); the Northumbrian king was probably Eanred. According to a later chronicler, Roger of Wendover, Ecgberht invaded Northumbria and plundered it before Eanred submitted: &quot;When Ecgberht had obtained all the southern kingdoms, he led a large army into Northumbria, and laid waste that province with severe pillaging, and made King Eanred pay tribute.&quot; Roger of Wendover is known to have incorporated Northumbrian annals into his version; the &quot;Chronicle&quot; does not mention these events. However, the nature of Eanred&#x27;s submission has been questioned: one historian has suggested that it is more likely that the meeting at Dore represented a mutual recognition of sovereignty.

In 830, Ecgberht led a successful expedition against the Welsh, almost certainly with the intent of extending West Saxon influence into the Welsh lands previously within the Mercian orbit. This marked the high point of Ecgberht&#x27;s influence.

== Reduction in influence after 829 ==
In 830, Mercia regained its independence under Wiglaf‚Äîthe &quot;Chronicle&quot; merely says that Wiglaf &quot;obtained the kingdom of Mercia again&quot;, but the most likely explanation is that this was the result of a Mercian rebellion against the Wessex rule.

Ecgberht&#x27;s dominion over southern England came to an end with Wiglaf&#x27;s recovery of power. Wiglaf&#x27;s return is followed by evidence of his independence from Wessex. Charters indicate Wiglaf had authority in Middlesex and Berkshire, and in a charter of 836, Wiglaf uses the phrase &quot;my bishops, &quot;duces&quot;, and magistrates&quot; to describe a group that included eleven bishops from the episcopate of Canterbury, including bishops of sees in West Saxon territory. It is significant that Wiglaf was still able to call together such a group of notables; the West Saxons, even if they were able to do so, held no such councils. Wiglaf may also have brought Essex back into the Mercian orbit during the years after he recovered the throne. In East Anglia, King √Üthelstan minted coins, possibly as early as 827, but more likely c. 830 after Ecgberht&#x27;s influence was reduced with Wiglaf&#x27;s return to power in Mercia. This demonstration of independence on East Anglia&#x27;s part is not surprising, as it was √Üthelstan who was probably responsible for the defeat and death of both Beornwulf and Ludeca.

Both Wessex&#x27;s sudden rise to power in the late 820s, and the subsequent failure to retain this dominant position, have been examined by historians looking for underlying causes. One plausible explanation for the events of these years is that Wessex&#x27;s fortunes were to some degree dependent on Carolingian support. The Franks supported Eardwulf when he recovered the throne of Northumbria in 808, so it is plausible that they also supported Ecgberht&#x27;s accession in 802. At Easter 839, not long before Ecgberht&#x27;s death, he was in touch with Louis the Pious, king of the Franks, to arrange safe passage to Rome. Hence a continuing relationship with the Franks seems to be part of southern English politics during the first half of the ninth century.

Carolingian support may have been one of the factors that helped Ecgberht achieve the military successes of the late 820s. However, the Rhenish and Frankish commercial networks collapsed at some time in the 820s or 830s, and in addition, a rebellion broke out in February 830 against Louis the Pious‚Äîthe first of a series of internal conflicts that lasted through the 830s and beyond. These distractions may have prevented Louis from supporting Ecgberht. In this view, the withdrawal of Frankish influence would have left East Anglia, Mercia, and Wessex to find a balance of power not dependent on outside aid.

Despite the loss of dominance, Ecgberht&#x27;s military successes fundamentally changed the political landscape of Anglo-Saxon England. Wessex retained control of the south-eastern kingdoms, with the possible exception of Essex, and Mercia did not regain control of East Anglia. Ecgberht&#x27;s victories marked the end of the independent existence of the kingdoms of Kent and Sussex. The conquered territories were administered as a subkingdom for a while, including Surrey and possibly Essex. Although √Üthelwulf was a subking under Ecgberht, it is clear that he maintained his own royal household, with which he travelled around his kingdom. Charters issued in Kent described Ecgberht and √Üthelwulf as &quot;kings of the West Saxons and also of the people of Kent&quot;. When √Üthelwulf died in 858 his will, in which Wessex is left to one son and the southeastern kingdom to another, makes it clear that it was not until after 858 that the kingdoms were fully integrated. Mercia remained a threat, however; Ecgberht&#x27;s son √Üthelwulf, established as king of Kent, gave estates to Christ Church, Canterbury, probably to counter any influence the Mercians might still have there.

In the southwest, Ecgberht was defeated in 836 at Carhampton by the Danes, but in 838 he won a battle against them and their allies the West Welsh at the Battle of Hingston Down in Cornwall. The Dumnonian royal line continued after this time, but it is at this date that the independence of one of the last British kingdoms may be considered to have ended. The details of Anglo-Saxon expansion into Cornwall are quite poorly recorded, but some evidence comes from place names. The River Ottery, which flows east into the Tamar near Launceston, appears to be a boundary: south of the Ottery the placenames are overwhelmingly Cornish, whereas to the north they are more heavily influenced by the English newcomers.

== Succession ==
At a council at Kingston upon Thames in 838, Ecgberht and √Üthelwulf granted land to the sees of Winchester and Canterbury in return for the promise of support for √Üthelwulf&#x27;s claim to the throne. The archbishop of Canterbury, Ceolnoth, also accepted Ecgberht and √Üthelwulf as the lords and protectors of the monasteries under Ceolnoth&#x27;s control. These agreements, along with a later charter in which √Üthelwulf confirmed church privileges, suggest that the church had recognised that Wessex was a new political power that must be dealt with. Churchmen consecrated the king at coronation ceremonies, and helped to write the wills which specified the king&#x27;s heir; their support had real value in establishing West Saxon control and a smooth succession for Ecgberht&#x27;s line. Both the record of the Council of Kingston, and another charter of that year, include the identical phrasing: that a condition of the grant is that &quot;we ourselves and our heirs shall always hereafter have firm and unshakable friendships from Archbishop Ceolnoth and his congregation at Christ Church.&quot;

Although nothing is known of any other claimants to the throne, it is likely that there were other surviving descendants of Cerdic (the supposed progenitor of all the kings of Wessex) who might have contended for the kingdom. Ecgberht died in 839, and his will, according to the account of it found in the will of his grandson, Alfred the Great, left land only to male members of his family, so that the estates should not be lost to the royal house through marriage. Ecgberht&#x27;s wealth, acquired through conquest, was no doubt one reason for his ability to purchase the support of the southeastern church establishment; the thriftiness of his will indicates he understood the importance of personal wealth to a king. The kingship of Wessex had been frequently contested among different branches of the royal line, and it is a noteworthy achievement of Ecgberht&#x27;s that he was able to ensure √Üthelwulf&#x27;s untroubled succession. In addition, √Üthelwulf&#x27;s experience of kingship, in the subkingdom formed from Ecgberht&#x27;s southeastern conquests, would have been valuable to him when he took the throne.

Ecgberht was buried in Winchester, as were his son, √Üthelwulf, his grandson, Alfred the Great, and his great-grandson, Edward the Elder. During the ninth century, Winchester began to show signs of urbanisation, and it is likely that the sequence of burials indicates that Winchester was held in high regard by the West Saxon royal line.
