<text>Chroma key compositing, or chroma keying, is a visual-effects and post-production technique for compositing (layering) two or more images or video streams together based on colour hues (chroma range). The technique has been used in many fields to remove a background from the subject of a photo or video – particularly the newscasting, motion picture, and video game industries. A colour range in the foreground footage is made transparent, allowing separately filmed background footage or a static image to be inserted into the scene. The chroma keying technique is commonly used in video production and post-production. This technique is also referred to as colour keying, colour separation overlay (CSO; primarily by the BBC), or by various terms for specific colour-related variants such as green screen or blue screen; chroma keying can be done with backgrounds of any colour that are uniform and distinct, but green and blue backgrounds are more commonly used because they differ most distinctly in hue from any human skin colour. No part of the subject being filmed or photographed may duplicate the colour used as the backing, or the part may be erroneously identified as part of the backing.

It is commonly used for live weather forecast broadcasts in which a news presenter is seen standing in front of a CGI map instead of a large blue or green background. Chroma keying is also common in the entertainment industry for visual effects in movies and video games. Rotoscopy may instead be carried out on subjects that are not in front of a green (or blue) screen. Motion tracking can also be used in conjunction with chroma keying, such as to move the background as the subject moves.

==History==

===Predecessors===

Prior to the introduction of travelling mattes and optical printing, double exposure was used to introduce elements into a scene which were not present in the initial exposure. This was done using black draping where a green screen would be used today. George Albert Smith first used this approach in 1898. In 1903, &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; by Edwin S. Porter used double exposure to add background scenes to windows which were black when filmed on set, using a garbage matte to expose only the window areas.
In order to have figures in one exposure actually move in front of a substituted background in the other, a travelling matte was needed, to occlude the correct portion of the background in each frame. In 1918 Frank Williams patented a travelling matte technique, again based on using a black background. This was used in many films, such as &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;.

In the 1920s, Walt Disney used a white backdrop to include human actors with cartoon characters and backgrounds in his &quot;Alice Comedies&quot;.

=== From bluescreen to greenscreen ===
The blue screen method was developed in the 1930s at RKO Radio Pictures. At RKO, Linwood Dunn used an early version of the travelling matte to create &quot;wipes&quot; – where there were transitions like a windshield wiper in films such as &quot;Flying Down to Rio&quot; (1933). Credited to Larry Butler, a scene featuring a genie escaping from a bottle was the first use of a proper bluescreen process to create a travelling matte for &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot; (1940), which won the Academy Award for Best Special Effects that year. In 1950, Warner Brothers employee and ex-Kodak researcher Arthur Widmer began working on an ultraviolet travelling matte process. He also began developing bluescreen techniques: one of the first films to use them was the 1958 adaptation of the Ernest Hemingway novella, &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;, starring Spencer Tracy.

The name &quot;Chroma-Key&quot; was RCA&#x27;s trade name for the process, as used on its NBC television broadcasts, incorporating patents granted to RCA&#x27;s Albert N. Goldsmith. A very early broadcast use was NBC&#x27;s George Gobel Show in fall 1957.

Petro Vlahos was awarded an Academy Award for his refinement of these techniques in 1964. His technique exploits the fact that most objects in real-world scenes have a colour whose blue-colour component is similar in intensity to their green-colour component. Zbigniew Rybczyński also contributed to bluescreen technology. An optical printer with two projectors, a film camera and a &quot;beam splitter&quot;, was used to combine the actor in front of a blue screen together with the background footage, one frame at a time. In the early 1970s, American and British television networks began using green backdrops instead of blue for their newscasts. During the 1980s, minicomputers were used to control the optical printer. For the film &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, Richard Edlund created a &quot;quad optical printer&quot; that accelerated the process considerably and saved money. He received a special Academy Award for his innovation.

For decades, travelling matte shots had to be done &quot;locked-down&quot;, so that neither the matted subject nor the background could shift their camera perspective at all. Later, computer-timed, motion-control cameras alleviated this problem, as both the foreground and background could be filmed with the same camera moves.

Meteorologists on television often use a field monitor, to the side of the screen, to see where they are putting their hands against the background images. A newer technique is to project a faint image onto the screen.

Some films make heavy use of chroma key to add backgrounds that are constructed entirely using computer-generated imagery (CGI). Performances from different takes can be composited together, which allows actors to be filmed separately and then placed together in the same scene. Chroma key allows performers to appear to be in any location without leaving the studio.

Advances in computer technology have simplified the incorporation of motion into composited shots, even when using handheld cameras. Reference points such as a painted grid, X&#x27;s marked with tape, or equally spaced tennis balls attached to the wall, can be placed onto the coloured background to serve as markers. In post-production, a computer can use these markers to compute the camera&#x27;s position and thus render an image that matches the perspective and movement of the foreground perfectly. Modern advances in software and computational power have eliminated the need to accurately place the markers ⁠— ⁠the software figures out their position in space; a potential disadvantage of this is that it requires camera movement, possibly contributing to modern cinematographic techniques whereby the camera is always in motion.

==Process==
The principal subject is filmed or photographed against a background consisting of a single colour or a relatively narrow range of colours, usually blue or green because these colours are considered to be the furthest away from skin tone. The portions of the video which match the pre-selected colour are replaced by the alternate background video. This process is commonly known as &quot;keying&quot;, &quot;keying out&quot; or simply a &quot;key&quot;.

===Processing a green backdrop===

Green is used as a backdrop for TV and electronic cinematography more than any other colour because television weather presenters tended to wear blue suits. When chroma keying first came into use in television production, the blue screen that was then the norm in the movie industry was used out of habit, until other practical considerations caused the television industry to move from blue to green screens. Broadcast-quality colour television cameras use separate red, green, and blue image sensors, and early analog TV chroma keyers required RGB component video to work reliably. From a technological perspective it was equally possible to use the blue or green channel, but because blue clothing was an ongoing challenge, the green screen came into common use. Newscasters sometimes forget the chroma key dress code, and when the key is applied to clothing of the same colour as the background, the person would seem to disappear into the key. Because green clothing is less common than blue, it soon became apparent that it was easier to use a green matte screen than it was to constantly police the clothing choices of on-air talent. Also, because the human eye is more sensitive to green wavelengths, which lie in the middle of the visible light spectrum, the green analog video channel typically carried more signal strength, giving a better signal to noise ratio compared to the other component video channels, so green screen keys could produce the cleanest key. In the digital television and cinema age, much of the tweaking that was required to make a good quality key has been automated. However, the one constant that remains is some level of colour coordination to keep foreground subjects from being keyed out.

===Processing a blue backdrop===
Before electronic chroma keying, compositing was done on (chemical) film. The camera colour negative was printed onto high-contrast black and white negative, using either a filter or the high contrast film&#x27;s colour sensitivity to expose only blue (and higher) frequencies. Blue light only shines through the colour negative where there is &quot;not&quot; blue in the scene, so this left the film clear where the blue screen was, and opaque elsewhere, except it also produced clear for any white objects (since they also contained blue). Removing these spots could be done by a suitable double-exposure with the colour positive (thus turning any area containing red or green opaque), and many other techniques. The result was film that was clear where the blue screen was, and opaque everywhere else. This is called a &quot;female matte&quot;, similar to an &quot;alpha matte&quot; in digital keying. Copying this film onto another high-contrast negative produced the opposite &quot;male matte&quot;. The background negative was then packed with the female matte and exposed onto a final strip of film, then the camera negative was packed with the male matte and was double-printed onto this same film. These two images combined creates the final effect.

===Major factors===
The most important factor for a key is the colour separation of the foreground (the subject) and background (the screen) – a blue screen will be used if the subject is predominantly green (for example plants), despite the camera being more sensitive to green light.

In analog television, colour is represented by the phase of the chroma subcarrier relative to a reference oscillator. Chroma key is achieved by comparing the phase of the video to the phase corresponding to the pre-selected colour. In-phase portions of the video are replaced by the alternate background video.

In digital colour TV, colour is represented by three numbers (red, green, blue intensity levels). Chroma key is achieved by a simple numerical comparison between the video and the pre-selected colour. If the colour at a particular point on the screen matches (either exactly, or in a range), then the video at that point is replaced by the alternate background.

====Lighting====
In order to create an illusion that characters and objects filmed are present in the intended background scene, the lighting in the two scenes must be a reasonable match. For outdoor scenes, overcast days create a diffuse, evenly coloured light which can be easier to match in the studio, whereas direct sunlight needs to be matched in both direction and overall colour based on time of day.

A studio shot taken in front of a green screen will naturally have ambient light the same colour as the screen, due to its light scattering. This effect is known as &quot;spill&quot;. This can look unnatural or cause portions of the characters to disappear, so must be compensated for, or avoided by using a larger screen placed far from the actors.

====Camera====
The depth of field used to record the scene in front of the coloured screen should match that of the background. This can mean recording the actors with a larger depth of field than normal.

==Clothing==

A chroma key subject must avoid wearing clothes which are similar in colour to the chroma key colour(s) (unless intentional e.g., wearing a green top to make it appear that the subject has no body), because the clothing may be replaced with the background image/video. An example of intentional use of this is when an actor wears a blue covering over a part of his body to make it invisible in the final shot. This technique can be used to achieve an effect similar to that used in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films to create the effect of an invisibility cloak. The actor can also be filmed against a chroma-key background and inserted into the background shot with a distortion effect, in order to create a cloak that is marginally detectable.

Difficulties emerge with blue screen when a costume in an effects shot must be blue, such as Superman&#x27;s traditional blue outfit. In the 2002 film &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, in scenes where both Spider-Man and the Green Goblin are in the air, Spider-Man had to be shot in front of a green screen and the Green Goblin had to be shot in front of a blue screen. The colour difference is because Spider-Man wears a costume which is red and blue in colour and the Green Goblin wears a costume which is entirely green in colour. If both were shot in front of the same screen, parts of one character would be erased from the shot.

For a clean division of foreground from background, it is also important that clothing and hair in the foreground shot have a fairly simple silhouette, as fine details such as frizzy hair may not resolve properly. Similarly, partially transparent elements of the costume cause problems.

==Background colour==
Blue was originally used for the film industry as making the separations required a film that would only respond to the screen colour, and film that responded only to blue and higher frequencies (ultraviolet, etc.) was far easier to manufacture and make reliable than film that somehow excluded both frequencies higher and lower than the screen colour.

In television and digital film making, however, it is equally easy to extract any colour, and green quickly became the favoured colour. Bright green is less likely to be in the foreground objects, colour film emulsions usually had much finer grain in the green, and lossy compression used for analog video signals and digital images and movies retain more detail in the green channel. Green can also be used outdoors where the light colour temperature is significantly blue. Red is avoided as it is in human skin, and any other colour is a mix of primaries and thus produces a less clean extraction.

A so-called &quot;yellow screen&quot; is accomplished with a white backdrop. Ordinary stage lighting is used in combination with a bright yellow sodium lamp. The sodium light falls almost entirely in a narrow frequency band, which can then be separated from the other light using a prism, and projected onto a separate but synchronized film carrier within the camera. This second film is high-contrast black and white, and is processed to produce the matte.

A newer technique is to use a retroreflective curtain in the background, along with a ring of bright LEDs around the camera lens. This requires no light to shine on the background other than the LEDs, which use an extremely small amount of power and space unlike big stage lights, and require no rigging. This advance was made possible by the invention in the 1990s of practical blue LEDs, which also allow for emerald green LEDs.

There is also a form of colour keying that uses light spectrum invisible to human eye. Called Thermo-Key, it uses infrared as the key colour, which would not be replaced by background image during postprocessing.

For &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, an ultraviolet light matting process was proposed by Don Lee of CIS Hollywood and developed by Gary Hutzel and the staff of Image G. This involved a fluorescent orange backdrop which made it easier to generate a holdout matte, thus allowing the effects team to produce effects in a quarter of the time needed for other methods.

In principle, any type of still background can be used as a chroma key instead of a solid colour. First the background is captured without actors or other foreground elements; then the scene is recorded. The image of the background is used to cancel the background in the actual footage; for example in a digital image, each pixel will have a different chroma key. This is sometimes referred to as a &quot;difference matte&quot;. However, this makes it easy for objects to be accidentally removed if they happen to be similar to the background, or for the background to remain due to camera noise or if it happens to change slightly from the reference footage. A background with a repeating pattern alleviates many of these issues, and can be less sensitive to wardrobe colour than solid-colour backdrops.
There is some use of the specific full-intensity magenta colour in digital colour images to encode (1-bit) transparency; this is sometimes referred to as &quot;magic pink&quot;. This is not a photographic technique and the extraction of the foreground from the background is trivial.

==Tolerances==

===Even lighting===

The biggest challenge when setting up a blue screen or green screen is even lighting and the avoidance of shadow because it is best to have as narrow a colour range as possible being replaced. A shadow would present itself as a darker colour to the camera and might not register for replacement. This can sometimes be seen in low-budget or live broadcasts where the errors cannot be manually repaired or scenes reshot. The material being used affects the quality and ease of having it evenly lit. Materials which are shiny will be far less successful than those that are not. A shiny surface will have areas that reflect the lights making them appear pale, while other areas may be darkened. A matte surface will diffuse the reflected light and have a more even colour range. In order to get the cleanest key from shooting green screen, it is necessary to create a value difference between the subject and the green screen. In order to differentiate the subject from the screen, a two-stop difference can be used, either by making the green screen two stops higher than the subject, or vice versa.

Sometimes a shadow can be used to create a visual effect. Areas of the blue screen or green screen with a shadow on them can be replaced with a darker version of the desired background video image, making it look like the person is casting a shadow on them. Any spill of the chroma key colour will make the result look unnatural. A difference in the focal length of the lenses used can affect the success of chroma key.

===Exposure===
Another challenge for blue screen or green screen is proper camera exposure. Underexposing or overexposing a coloured backdrop can lead to poor saturation levels. In the case of video cameras, underexposed images can contain high amounts of noise, as well. The background must be bright enough to allow the camera to create a bright and saturated image.

==Programming==
There are several different quality- and speed-optimised techniques for implementing colour keying in software.

In most versions, a function (, , ) → is applied to every pixel in the image.  (alpha) has a meaning similar to that in alpha compositing techniques.  ≤ 0 means the pixel is fully in the green screen,  ≥ 1 means the pixel is fully in the foreground object, and intermediate values indicate the pixel is partially covered by the foreground object (or it is transparent). A further function (, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) → (, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) is needed to remove green spill on the foreground objects.

A very simple () function for green screen is (+&quot;b&quot;) − where and are user adjustable constants with a default value of 1.0. A very simple () is (&quot;r&quot;, min(&quot;g&quot;,&quot;b&quot;), &quot;b&quot;). This is fairly close to the capabilities of analog and film-based screen pulling.

Modern examples of these functions are best described by two closed nested surfaces in 3D RGB space, often quite complex. Colours inside the inner surface are considered green screen. Colours outside the outer surface are opaque foreground. Colours between the surfaces are partially covered, they are more opaque the closer they are to the outer surface. Sometimes more closed surfaces are used to determine how to remove green spill. It is also very common for () to depend on more than just the current pixel&#x27;s colour, it may also use the (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) position, the values of nearby pixels, the value from reference images or a statistical colour model of the scene, and values from user-drawn masks. These produce closed surfaces in space with more than three dimensions.

A different class of algorithm tries to figure out a 2D path that separates the foreground from the background. This path can be the output, or the image can be drawn by filling the path with  = 1 as a final step. An example of such an algorithm is the use of active contour. Most research in recent years has been into these algorithms.

<text>In the design of DBMS, the identity map pattern is a database access design pattern used to improve performance by providing a context-specific, in-memory cache to prevent duplicate retrieval of the same object data from the database.

If the requested data has already been loaded from the database, the identity map returns the same instance of the already instantiated object, but if it has not been loaded yet, it loads it and stores the new object in the map. In this way, it follows a similar principle to lazy loading.

There are 4 types of identity maps
#Explicit
#Generic
#Session
#Class

<doc id="46956" wikidata="Q1054571" url="?curid=46956" title="Cepstrum">
<text>In Fourier analysis, the cepstrum (; plural &quot;cepstra&quot;, adjective &quot;cepstral&quot;) is the result of computing the inverse Fourier transform (IFT) of the logarithm of the estimated signal spectrum. The method is a tool for investigating periodic structures in frequency spectra. The &quot;power cepstrum&quot; has applications in the analysis of human speech.

The term &quot;cepstrum&quot; was derived by reversing the first four letters of &quot;spectrum&quot;. Operations on cepstra are labelled &quot;quefrency analysis&quot; (or &quot;quefrency alanysis&quot;), &quot;liftering&quot;, or &quot;cepstral analysis&quot;. It may be pronounced in the two ways given, the second having the advantage of avoiding confusion with &quot;kepstrum&quot;.

==Origin==
The concept of the cepstrum was introduced in 1963 by B. P. Bogert, M. J. Healy, and J. W. Tukey. It serves as a tool to investigate periodic structures in frequency spectra. Such effects are related to noticeable echos or reflections in the signal, or to the occurrence of harmonic frequencies (partials, overtones). Mathematically it deals with the problem of deconvolution of signals in the frequency space.

References to the Bogert paper, in a bibliography, are often edited incorrectly. The terms &quot;quefrency&quot;, &quot;alanysis&quot;, &quot;cepstrum&quot; and &quot;saphe&quot; were invented by the authors by rearranging the letters in frequency, analysis, spectrum, and phase. The invented terms are defined in analogy to the older terms.

==General definition==
The cepstrum is the result of following sequence of mathematical operations:
*transformation of a signal from the time domain to the frequency domain
*computation of the logarithm of the spectral amplitude
*transformation to frequency domain, where the final independent variable, the quefrency, has a time scale.

==Types==

The cepstrum is used in many variants. Most important are:
* power cepstrum: The logarithm is taken from the &quot;power spectrum&quot;
* complex cepstrum: The logarithm is taken from the spectrum, which is calculated via Fourier analysis

The following abbreviations are used in the formulas to explain the cepstrum:
===Power cepstrum===
The &quot;cepstrum&quot; was originally defined as power cepstrum by the following relationship:

:formula_1

The power cepstrum has main applications in analysis of sound and vibration signals. It is a complementary tool to spectral analysis.

Sometimes it is also defined as:

:formula_2
Due to this formula, the cepstrum is also sometimes called the &quot;spectrum of a spectrum&quot;. It can be shown that both formulas are consistent with each other as the frequency spectral distribution remains the same, the only difference being a scaling factor which can be applied afterwards. Some articles prefer the second formula.

Other notations are possible due to the fact that the log of the power spectrum is equal to the log of the spectrum if a scaling factor 2 is applied:
:formula_3 
and therefore:
:formula_4
:formula_5

which provides a relationship to the &quot;real cepstrum&quot; (see below).

Further, it shall be noted, that the final squaring operation in the formula for the power spectrum formula_6 is sometimes called unnecessary and therefore sometimes omitted.

The real cepstrum is directly related to the power cepstrum:

:formula_7

It is derived from the complex cepstrum (defined below) by discarding the phase information (contained in the imaginary part of the complex logarithm). It has a focus on periodic effects in the amplitudes of the spectrum:

:formula_8

===Complex cepstrum===
The complex cepstrum was defined by Oppenheim in his development of homomorphic system theory. The formula is provided also in other literature.

:formula_9

As formula_10 is complex the log-term can be also written with formula_10 as a product of magnitude and phase, and subsequently as a sum. Further simplification is obvious, if log is a natural logarithm with base &quot;e&quot;:

:formula_12

The complex cepstrum retains the information about the phase. Thus it is always possible to return from the quefrency domain to the time domain by the inverse operation:

:formula_13

where &quot;b&quot; is the base of the used logarithm.

Main application is the modification of the signal in the quefrency domain (liftering) as an analog operation to filtering in the spectral frequency domain. An example is the suppression of echo effects by suppression of certain quefrencies.

The phase cepstrum (after phase spectrum) is related to the complex cepstrum as
: phase spectrum = (complex cepstrum − time reversal of complex cepstrum)2.

==Related concepts==

The independent variable of a cepstral graph is called the quefrency. The quefrency is a measure of time, though not in the sense of a signal in the time domain. For example, if the sampling rate of an audio signal is 44100 Hz and there is a large peak in the cepstrum whose quefrency is 100 samples, the peak indicates the presence of a fundamental frequency that is 44100/100 = 441 Hz. This peak occurs in the cepstrum because the harmonics in the spectrum are periodic and the period corresponds to the fundamental frequency, since harmonics are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency.

The &quot;kepstrum&quot;, which stands for &quot;Kolmogorov-equation power-series time response&quot;, is similar to the cepstrum and has the same relation to it as expected value has to statistical average, i.e. cepstrum is the empirically measured quantity, while kepstrum is the theoretical quantity. It was in use before the cepstrum.

 The autocepstrum is defined as the cepstrum of the autocorrelation. The autocepstrum is more accurate than the cepstrum in the analysis of data with echoes.

Playing further on the anagram theme, a filter that operates on a cepstrum might be called a &quot;lifter&quot;. A low-pass lifter is similar to a low-pass filter in the frequency domain. It can be implemented by multiplying by a window in the quefrency domain and then converting back to the frequency domain, resulting in a modified signal, i.e. with signal echo being reduced.

==Interpretation==
The cepstrum can be seen as information about the rate of change in the different spectrum bands. It was originally invented for characterizing the seismic echoes resulting from earthquakes and bomb explosions. It has also been used to determine the fundamental frequency of human speech and to analyze radar signal returns. Cepstrum pitch determination is particularly effective because the effects of the vocal excitation (pitch) and vocal tract (formants) are additive in the logarithm of the power spectrum and thus clearly separate.

The cepstrum is a representation used in homomorphic signal processing, to convert signals combined by convolution (such as a source and filter) into sums of their cepstra, for linear separation. In particular, the power cepstrum is often used as a feature vector for representing the human voice and musical signals. For these applications, the spectrum is usually first transformed using the mel scale. The result is called the mel-frequency cepstrum or MFC (its coefficients are called mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, or MFCCs). It is used for voice identification, pitch detection and much more. The cepstrum is useful in these applications because the low-frequency periodic excitation from the vocal cords and the formant filtering of the vocal tract, which convolve in the time domain and multiply in the frequency domain, are additive and in different regions in the quefrency domain.

Note that a pure sine wave can not be used to test the cepstrum for its pitch determination from quefrency as a pure sine wave does not contain any harmonics and does not lead to quefrency peaks. Rather, a test signal containing harmonics should be used (such as the sum of at least two sines where the second sine is some harmonic (multiple) of the first sine, or better, a signal with a square or triangle waveform, as such signals provide many overtones in the spectrum.).

An important property of the cepstral domain is that the convolution of two signals can be expressed as the addition of their complex cepstra:
: formula_14

==Applications==

The concept of the cepstrum has led to numerous applications:
* dealing with reflection inference (radar, sonar applications, earth seismology)
* estimation of speaker fundamental frequency (pitch)
* speech analysis and recognition
* medical applications in analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) and brain waves
* machine vibration analysis based on harmonic patterns (gearbox faults, turbine blade failures, ...)

Recently, cepstrum-based deconvolution was used on surface electromyography signals, to remove the effect of the stochastic impulse train, which originates an sEMG signal, from the power spectrum of the sEMG signal itself. In this way, only information about the motor unit action potential (MUAP) shape and amplitude was maintained, which was then used to estimate the parameters of a time-domain model of the MUAP itself.

A short-time cepstrum analysis was proposed by Schroeder and Noll in the 1960s for application to pitch determination of human speech.

<doc id="46959" wikidata="Q223137" url="?curid=46959" title="Koch snowflake">
<text>The Koch snowflake (also known as the Koch curve, Koch star, or Koch island) is a fractal curve and one of the earliest fractals to have been described. It is based on the Koch curve, which appeared in a 1904 paper titled &quot;On a Continuous Curve Without Tangents, Constructible from Elementary Geometry&quot; by the Swedish mathematician Helge von Koch.

The Koch snowflake can be built up iteratively, in a sequence of stages. The first stage is an equilateral triangle, and each successive stage is formed by adding outward bends to each side of the previous stage, making smaller equilateral triangles. The areas enclosed by the successive stages in the construction of the snowflake converge to formula_1 times the area of the original triangle, while the perimeters of the successive stages increase without bound. Consequently, the snowflake encloses a finite area, but has an infinite perimeter.

The Koch snowflake has been constructed as an example of a continuous curve where drawing a tangent line to any point is impossible. Unlike the earlier Weierstrass function where the proof was purely analytical, the Koch snowflake was created to be possible to geometrically represent at the time, so that this property could also be seen through &quot;naive intuition&quot;.

== Origin and history ==
There is no doubt that the snowflake curve is based on the von Koch curve and its iterative construction. However, the picture of the snowflake does not appear in either the original article published in 1904 nor in the extended 1906 memoir. So one can ask who is the man who constructed the snowflake figure first. An investigation of this question suggests that the snowflake curve is due to the American mathematician Edward Kasner.

==Construction==
The Koch snowflake can be constructed by starting with an equilateral triangle, then recursively altering each line segment as follows:
# divide the line segment into three segments of equal length.
# draw an equilateral triangle that has the middle segment from step 1 as its base and points outward.
# remove the line segment that is the base of the triangle from step 2.

The first iteration of this process produces the outline of a hexagram.

The Koch snowflake is the limit approached as the above steps are followed indefinitely. The Koch curve originally described by Helge von Koch is constructed using only one of the three sides of the original triangle. In other words, three Koch curves make a Koch snowflake.

A Koch curve–based representation of a nominally flat surface can similarly be created by repeatedly segmenting each line in a sawtooth pattern of segments with a given angle. 
==Properties==

===Perimeter of the Koch snowflake===

Each iteration multiplies the number of sides in the Koch snowflake by four, so the number of sides after formula_2 iterations is given by:

formula_3

If the original equilateral triangle has sides of length formula_4, the length of each side of the snowflake after formula_2 iterations is:

formula_6

an inverse power of three multiple of the original length.
The perimeter of the snowflake after formula_2 iterations is:

formula_8

The Koch curve has an infinite length, because the total length of the curve increases by a factor of formula_9 with each iteration. Each iteration creates four times as many line segments as in the previous iteration, with the length of each one being formula_10 the length of the segments in the previous stage. Hence, the length of the curve after formula_2 iterations will be formula_12 times the original triangle perimeter and is unbounded, as formula_2 tends to infinity.

====Limit of perimeter====

As the number of iterations tends to infinity, the limit of the perimeter is:

formula_14

since formula_15.

An formula_16-dimensional measure exists, but has not been calculated so far. Only upper and lower bounds have been invented. 

===Area of the Koch snowflake===

In each iteration a new triangle is added on each side of the previous iteration, so the number of new triangles added in iteration formula_2 is:

formula_18

The area of each new triangle added in an iteration is formula_19 of the area of each triangle added in the previous iteration, so the area of each triangle added in iteration formula_2 is:

formula_21

where formula_22 is the area of the original triangle. The total new area added in iteration formula_2 is therefore:

formula_24

The total area of the snowflake after formula_2 iterations is:

formula_26

Collapsing the geometric sum gives:

formula_27

====Limits of area====

The limit of the area is:

formula_28

since formula_29.

Thus, the area of the Koch snowflake is formula_1 of the area of the original triangle. Expressed in terms of the side length formula_4 of the original triangle, this is: 
formula_32

==== Solid of revolution ====
The volume of the solid of revolution of the Koch snowflake about an axis of symmetry of the initiating equilateral triangle of unit side is formula_33

===Other properties===
The Koch snowflake is self-replicating with six smaller copies surrounding one larger copy at the center. Hence, it is an irrep-7 irrep-tile (see Rep-tile for discussion).

The fractal dimension of the Koch curve is formula_34. This is greater than that of a line (formula_35) but less than that of Peano&#x27;s space-filling curve (formula_36).

It is impossible to draw a tangent line to any point of the curve.

==Representation as a de Rham curve==
The Koch curve arises as a special case of a de Rham curve. The de Rham curves are mappings of Cantor space into the plane, usually arranged so as to form a continuous curve. Every point on a continuous de Rham curve corresponds to a real number in the unit interval. For the Koch curve, the tips of the snowflake correspond to the dyadic rationals: each tip can be uniquely labeled with a distinct dyadic rational.

==Tessellation of the plane==

It is possible to tessellate the plane by copies of Koch snowflakes in two different sizes. However, such a tessellation is not possible using only snowflakes of one size. Since each Koch snowflake in the tessellation can be subdivided into seven smaller snowflakes of two different sizes, it is also possible to find tessellations that use more than two sizes at once. Koch snowflakes and Koch antisnowflakes of the same size may be used to tile the plane.

== Thue–Morse sequence and turtle graphics ==
A turtle graphic is the curve that is generated if an automaton is programmed with a sequence.
If the Thue–Morse sequence members are used in order to select program states:

* If formula_37, move ahead by one unit,
* If formula_38, rotate counterclockwise by an angle of formula_39,

the resulting curve converges to the Koch snowflake.

==Representation as Lindenmayer system==
The Koch curve can be expressed by the following rewrite system (Lindenmayer system):

:Alphabet : F
:Constants : +, −
:Axiom : F
:Production rules : F → F+F--F+F

Here, &quot;F&quot; means &quot;draw forward&quot;, &quot;-&quot; means &quot;turn right 60°&quot;, and &quot;+&quot; means &quot;turn left 60°&quot;.

To create the Koch snowflake, one would use F--F--F (an equilateral triangle) as the axiom.

== Variants of the Koch curve ==
Following von Koch&#x27;s concept, several variants of the Koch curve were designed, considering right angles (quadratic), other angles (Cesàro), circles and polyhedra and their extensions to higher dimensions (Sphereflake and Kochcube, respectively)

Squares can be used to generate similar fractal curves. Starting with a unit square and adding to each side at each iteration a square with dimension one third of the squares in the previous iteration, it can be shown that both the length of the perimeter and the total area are determined by geometric progressions. The progression for the area converges to formula_40 while the progression for the perimeter diverges to infinity, so as in the case of the Koch snowflake, we have a finite area bounded by an infinite fractal curve. The resulting area fills a square with the same center as the original, but twice the area, and rotated by formula_41 radians, the perimeter touching but never overlapping itself.

The total area covered at the formula_2th iteration is:
formula_43

while the total length of the perimeter is:
formula_44
which approaches infinity as formula_2 increases.

=== Functionalisation ===

In addition to the curve, the paper by Helge von Koch that has established the Koch curve shows a variation of the curve as an example of a continuous everywhere yet nowhere differentiable function that was possible to represent geometrically at the time. From the base straight line, represented as AB, the graph can be drawn by recursively applying the following on each line segment:
* Divide the line segment (&quot;XY&quot;) into three parts of equal length, divided by dots &quot;C&quot; and &quot;E&quot;.
* Draw a line &quot;DM&quot;, where &quot;M&quot; is the middle point of &quot;CE&quot;, and &quot;DM&quot; is perpendicular to the initial base of &quot;AB&quot;, having the length of formula_46.
* Draw the lines &quot;CD&quot; and &quot;DE&quot; and erase the lines &quot;CE&quot; and &quot;DM&quot;.
Each point of &quot;AB&quot; can be shown to converge to a single height. If formula_47 is defined as the distance of that point to the initial base, then formula_48 as a function is continuous everywhere and differentiable nowhere.

<text>Thomas Crapper (baptised 28 September 1836; died 27 January 1910) was an English plumber and businessman. He founded Thomas Crapper &amp; Co in London, a plumbing equipment company. His notability with regard to toilets has often been overstated, mostly due to the publication in 1969 of a fictional biography by New Zealand satirist Wallace Reyburn.

Crapper held nine patents, three of them for water closet improvements such as the floating ballcock. He improved the S-bend plumbing trap in 1880 by inventing the U-bend. The firm&#x27;s lavatorial equipment was manufactured at premises in nearby Marlborough Road (now Draycott Avenue). The company owned the world&#x27;s first bath, toilet and sink showroom in King&#x27;s Road. Crapper was noted for the quality of his products and received several royal warrants.

Manhole covers with Crapper&#x27;s company&#x27;s name on them in Westminster Abbey have become one of London&#x27;s minor tourist attractions.

==Life==
Thomas Crapper was born in Thorne, West Riding of Yorkshire, in 1836; the exact date is unknown, but he was baptised on 28 September 1836. His father, Charles, was a sailor. In 1853, he was apprenticed to his brother George, a master plumber in Chelsea, and thereafter spent three years as a journeyman plumber.

In 1861 Crapper set himself up as a sanitary engineer with his own brass foundry and workshops in nearby Marlborough Road.
In the 1880s Prince Albert (later Edward VII) purchased his country seat of Sandringham House in Norfolk and asked Thomas Crapper &amp; Co. to supply the plumbing, including thirty lavatories with cedarwood seats and enclosures, thus giving Crapper his first Royal Warrant. The firm received further warrants from Edward as king and from George V, both as Prince of Wales and as king.

In 1904 Crapper retired, passing the firm to his nephew George and his business partner Robert Marr Wharam. Crapper lived at 12 Thornsett Road, Anerley, for the last six years of his life and died on 27 January 1910. He was buried in the nearby Elmers End Cemetery.

==Posthumous fate of the Crapper company==
In 1966 the Crapper company was sold by then-owner Robert G. Wharam (son of Robert Marr Wharam) upon his retirement to its rival John Bolding &amp; Sons. Bolding went into liquidation in 1969. The company fell out of use until it was acquired by Simon Kirby, a historian and collector of antique bathroom fittings, who relaunched the company in Stratford-upon-Avon, producing authentic reproductions of Crapper&#x27;s original Victorian bathroom fittings.

==Achievements==

As the first man to set up public showrooms for displaying sanitary ware, Crapper became known as an advocate of sanitary plumbing, popularising the notion of installation inside people&#x27;s homes. He also helped refine and develop improvements to existing plumbing and sanitary fittings. As a part of his business he maintained a foundry and metal shop, which enabled him to try out new designs and develop more efficient plumbing solutions.

Crapper improved the S-bend trap in 1880. The new U-bend plumbing trap was a significant improvement on the &quot;S&quot; as it could not jam, and unlike the S-bend, it did not have a tendency to dry out and did not need an overflow. The BBC nominated the S-bend as one of the &quot;50 Things That (have) Made the Modern Economy&quot;.

Crapper held nine patents, three of them for water closet improvements such as the floating ballcock, but none for the flush toilet itself.

Crapper&#x27;s advertisements implied the siphonic flush was his invention. One such advertisement read, &quot;Crapper&#x27;s Valveless Water Waste Preventer (Patent #4,990) One movable part only&quot;, even though patent 4,990 (for a minor improvement to the water waste preventer) was not his, but that of Albert Giblin in 1898. However, Crapper&#x27;s nephew, George, did improve the siphon mechanism by which the water flow starts. A patent for this development was awarded in 1897.

==Origin of the word &quot;crap&quot;==
It has often been claimed in popular culture that the vulgar slang term for human bodily waste, &quot;&quot;, originated with Thomas Crapper because of his association with lavatories. A common version of this story is that American servicemen stationed in England during World War I saw his name on cisterns and used it as Army slang, i.e., &quot;I&#x27;m going to the crapper&quot;.

The word &quot;crap&quot; is actually of Middle English origin and predates its application to bodily waste. Its most likely etymological origin is a combination of two older words: the Dutch &quot;krappen&quot; (to pluck off, cut off, or separate) and the Old French &quot;crappe&quot; (siftings, waste or rejected matter, from the medieval Latin &quot;crappa&quot;). In English, it was used to refer to chaff and also to weeds or other rubbish. Its first recorded application to bodily waste, according to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, appeared in 1846, 10 years after Crapper was born, under a reference to a &quot;crapping ken,&quot; or a privy, where &quot;ken&quot; means a house.

<doc id="46963" wikidata="Q2600" url="?curid=46963" title="Cunt">
<text>&quot;Cunt&quot; () is a vulgar word for the vulva in its primary sense, and it is used in a variety of ways, including as a term of disparagement. &quot;Cunt&quot; is often used as a disparaging and obscene term for a woman in the United States, an unpleasant or objectionable person (regardless of gender) in the United Kingdom and Ireland, or a contemptible man in Australia and New Zealand. In Australia and New Zealand, it can also be a neutral or positive term when used with a positive qualifier (e.g., &quot;He&#x27;s a good cunt&quot;). The term has various derivative senses, including adjective and verb uses.

== History ==
The earliest known use of the word, according to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, was as part of a placename: an Oxford street called Gropecunt Lane, , now by the name of Grove Passage or Magpie Lane. Use of the word as a term of abuse is relatively recent, dating from the late nineteenth century. The word was not considered vulgar in the Middle Ages, but became so during the seventeenth century, and it was omitted from dictionaries from the late eighteenth century until the 1960s.

==Etymology==

The etymology of &quot;cunt&quot; is a matter of debate, but most sources consider the word to have derived from a Germanic word (Proto-Germanic &quot;*kuntō&quot;, stem &quot;*kuntōn-&quot;), which appeared as &#x27; in Old Norse. Scholars are uncertain of the origin of the Proto-Germanic form itself. There are cognates in most Germanic languages, most of which also have the same meaning as the English cunt, such as the Swedish, Faroese and Nynorsk &#x27;; West Frisian and Middle Low German &#x27;; another Middle Low German &#x27;; Middle High German &#x27; (meaning &quot;&quot;); modern German &#x27;; Middle Dutch &#x27;; modern Dutch words &#x27; (same meaning) and &#x27; (&quot;butt&quot;, &quot;arse&quot;); and perhaps Old English &#x27;.

The etymology of the Proto-Germanic term is disputed. It may have arisen by Grimm&#x27;s law operating on the Proto-Indo-European root &#x27; &quot; seen in gonads, genital, gamete, genetics, gene, or the Proto-Indo-European root &#x27; &quot; (, seen in gynaecology). Similarly, its use in England likely evolved from the Latin word &quot;cunnus&quot; (&quot;vulva&quot;), or one of its derivatives French &quot;con&quot;, Spanish &quot;coño&quot;, and Portuguese &quot;cona&quot;. Other Latin words related to &quot;cunnus&quot; are &#x27; (&quot;) and its derivative &#x27; (&quot;, (figurative) &quot;&quot;), leading to English words such as &quot;cuneiform&quot; (&quot;&quot;). In Middle English, &quot;cunt&quot; appeared with many spellings, such as &#x27;, &#x27; and &quot;&quot;, which did not always reflect the actual pronunciation of the word.

The word, in its modern meaning, is attested in Middle English. &quot;Proverbs of Hendyng&quot;, a manuscript from some time before 1325, includes the advice:
==Offensiveness==
===Generally===
The word &quot;cunt&quot; is generally regarded in English-speaking countries as profanity and unsuitable for normal public discourse. It has been described as &quot;the most heavily tabooed word of all English words&quot;, although John Ayto, editor of the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Slang&quot;, says &quot;nigger&quot; is more taboo.

===Feminist perspectives===

Some American feminists of the 1970s sought to eliminate disparaging terms for women, including &quot;bitch&quot; and &quot;cunt&quot;. In the context of pornography, Catharine MacKinnon argued that use of the word acts to reinforce a dehumanisation of women by reducing them to mere body parts; and in 1979 Andrea Dworkin described the word as reducing women to &quot;the one essential – &#x27;cunt: our essence ... our offence&#x27;&quot;.

Despite criticisms, there is a movement among feminists that seeks to reclaim &quot;cunt&quot; not only as acceptable, but as an honorific, in much the same way that &quot;queer&quot; has been reappropriated by LGBT people and &quot;nigger&quot; has been by some African-Americans. Proponents include artist Tee Corinne in &quot;The Cunt Coloring Book&quot; (1975); Eve Ensler in &quot;Reclaiming Cunt&quot; from &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; (1996); and Inga Muscio in her book, &quot;&quot; (1998).

Germaine Greer, the feminist writer and professor of English who once published a magazine article entitled &quot;Lady, Love Your Cunt&quot; (anthologised in 1986), discussed the origins, usage and power of the word in the BBC series &quot;Balderdash and Piffle&quot;, explaining how her views had developed over time. In the 1970s she had &quot;championed&quot; the use of the word for the female genitalia, thinking it &quot;shouldn&#x27;t be abusive&quot;; she rejected the &quot;proper&quot; word vagina, a Latin name meaning &quot;sword-sheath&quot; originally applied by male anatomists to all muscle coverings (see synovial sheath) – not just because it refers only to the internal canal but also because of the implication that the female body is &quot;simply a receptacle for a weapon&quot;. But in 2006, referring to its use as a term of abuse, she said that, though used in some quarters as a term of affection, it had become &quot;the most offensive insult one man could throw at another&quot; and suggested that the word was &quot;sacred&quot;, and &quot;a word of immense power, to be used sparingly&quot;. Greer said in 2006 that cunt&#x27; is one of the few remaining words in the English language with a genuine power to shock.&quot;

==Usage: pre-twentieth century==
&quot;Cunt&quot; has been attested in its anatomical meaning since at least the 13th century. While Francis Grose&#x27;s 1785 &quot;A Classical Dictionary of The Vulgar Tongue&quot; listed the word as &quot;C**T: a nasty name for a nasty thing&quot;, it did not appear in any major English dictionary from 1795 to 1961, when it was included in &quot;Webster&#x27;s Third New International Dictionary&quot; with the comment &quot;usu. considered obscene&quot;. Its first appearance in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; was in 1972, which cites the word as having been in use from 1230 in what was supposedly a London street name of &quot;Gropecunte Lane&quot;. It was, however, also used before 1230, having been brought over by the Anglo-Saxons, originally not an obscenity but rather an ordinary name for the vulva or vagina. Gropecunt Lane was originally a street of prostitution, a red light district. It was normal in the Middle Ages for streets to be named after the goods available for sale therein, hence the prevalence in cities having a medieval history of names such as &quot;Silver Street&quot; and &quot;Fish Street&quot;. In some locations, the former name has been bowdlerised, as in the City of York, to the more acceptable &quot;Grape Lane&quot;.

The somewhat similar word &#x27;queynte&#x27; appears several times in Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; (c. 1390), in bawdy contexts, but since it is used openly, does not appear to have been considered obscene at that time. A notable use is from the &quot;Miller&#x27;s Tale&quot;: &quot;Pryvely he caught her by the queynte.&quot; The Wife of Bath also uses this term, &quot;For certeyn, olde dotard, by your leave/You shall have queynte right enough at eve ... What aileth you to grouche thus and groan?/Is it for ye would have my queynte alone?&quot; In modernised versions of these passages the word &quot;queynte&quot; is usually translated simply as &quot;cunt&quot;. However, in Chaucer&#x27;s usage there seems to be an overlap between the words &quot;cunt&quot; and &quot;quaint&quot; (possibly derived from the Latin for &quot;known&quot;). &quot;Quaint&quot; was probably pronounced in Middle English in much the same way as &quot;cunt&quot;. It is sometimes unclear whether the two words were thought of as distinct from one another. Elsewhere in Chaucer&#x27;s work the word &quot;queynte&quot; seems to be used with meaning comparable to the modern &quot;quaint&quot; (curious or old-fashioned, but nevertheless appealing). This ambiguity was still being exploited by the 17th century; Andrew Marvell&#x27;s &quot;... then worms shall try / That long preserved virginity, / And your quaint honour turn to dust, / And into ashes all my lust&quot; in &quot;To His Coy Mistress&quot; depends on a pun on these two senses of &quot;quaint&quot;.

By Shakespeare&#x27;s day, the word seems to have become obscene. Although Shakespeare does not use the word explicitly (or with derogatory meaning) in his plays, he still uses wordplay to sneak it in obliquely. In Act III, Scene 2, of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, as the castle&#x27;s residents are settling in to watch the play-within-the-play, Hamlet asks his girlfriend Ophelia, &quot;Lady, shall I lie in your lap?&quot; Ophelia replies, &quot;No, my lord.&quot; Hamlet, feigning shock, says, &quot;Do you think I meant &quot;country matters&quot;?&quot; Then, to drive home the point that the accent is definitely on the first syllable of &quot;country&quot;, Shakespeare has Hamlet say, &quot;That&#x27;s a fair thought, to lie between maids&#x27; legs.&quot; In &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; (Act II, Scene V) the puritanical Malvolio believes he recognises his employer&#x27;s handwriting in an anonymous letter, commenting &quot;There be her very Cs, her Us, and her Ts: and thus makes she her great Ps&quot;, unwittingly punning on &quot;cunt&quot; and &quot;piss&quot;, and while it has also been argued that the slang term &quot;cut&quot; is intended, Pauline Kiernan writes that Shakespeare ridicules &quot;prissy puritanical party-poopers&quot; by having &quot;a Puritan spell out the word &#x27;cunt&#x27; on a public stage&quot;. A related scene occurs in &quot;Henry V&quot;: when Katherine is learning English, she is appalled at the &quot;gros, et impudique&quot; words &quot;foot&quot; and &quot;gown&quot;, which her teacher has mispronounced as &quot;coun&quot;. It is usually argued that Shakespeare intends to suggest that she has misheard &quot;foot&quot; as &quot;foutre&quot; (French, &quot;fuck&quot;) and &quot;coun&quot; as &quot;con&quot; (French &quot;cunt&quot;, also used to mean &quot;idiot&quot;).

Similarly, John Donne alludes to the obscene meaning of the word without being explicit in his poem &quot;The Good-Morrow&quot;, referring to sucking on &quot;country pleasures&quot;. The 1675 Restoration comedy &quot;The Country Wife&quot; also features such word play, even in its title.

By the 17th century, a softer form of the word, &quot;cunny&quot;, came into use. A well-known use of this derivation can be found in the 25 October 1668 entry of the diary of Samuel Pepys. He was discovered having an affair with Deborah Willet: he wrote that his wife &quot;coming up suddenly, did find me embracing the girl con [with] my hand sub [under] su [her] coats; and endeed I was with my main [hand] in her cunny. I was at a wonderful loss upon it and the girl also ...&quot;

&quot;Cunny&quot; was probably derived from a pun on &quot;coney&quot;, meaning &quot;rabbit&quot;, rather as &quot;pussy&quot; is connected to the same term for a cat. (Philip Massinger (1583–1640): &quot;A pox upon your Christian cockatrices! They cry, like poulterers&#x27; wives, &#x27;No money, no coney.&#x27;&quot;) Because of this slang use as a synonym for a taboo term, the word &quot;coney&quot;, when it was used in its original sense to refer to rabbits, came to be pronounced as (rhymes with &quot;phoney&quot;), instead of the original (rhymes with &quot;honey&quot;). Eventually, the taboo association led to the word &quot;coney&quot; becoming deprecated entirely and replaced by the word &quot;rabbit&quot;.

Robert Burns (1759–1796) used the word in his &quot;Merry Muses of Caledonia&quot;, a collection of bawdy verses which he kept to himself and were not publicly available until the mid-1960s. In &quot;Yon, Yon, Yon, Lassie&quot;, this couplet appears: &quot;For ilka birss upon her cunt, Was worth a ryal ransom&quot; (&quot;For every hair upon her cunt was worth a royal ransom&quot;).

==Usage: modern==
===As a term of abuse===
Merriam-Webster states it is a &quot;usually disparaging and obscene&quot; term for a woman, and that it is an &quot;offensive way to refer to a woman&quot; in the United States. In American slang, the term can also be used to refer to &quot;a fellow male homosexual one dislikes&quot;. Australian scholar Emma Alice Jane describes how the term as used on modern social media is an example of what she calls &quot;gendered vitriol&quot;, and an example of misogynistic e-bile. As a broader derogatory term, it is comparable to &quot;prick&quot; and means &quot;a fool, a dolt, an unpleasant person – of either sex&quot;. This sense is common in New Zealand, British, and Australian English, where it is usually applied to men or as referring &quot;specifically&quot; to &quot;a despicable, contemptible or foolish&quot; &quot;man&quot;.

During the 1971 Oz trial for obscenity, prosecuting counsel asked writer George Melly, &quot;Would you call your 10-year-old daughter a cunt?&quot; Melly replied, &quot;No, because I don&#x27;t think she is.&quot;

In the 1975 film &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, the central character McMurphy, when pressed to explain exactly why he does not like the tyrannical Nurse Ratched, says, &quot;Well, I don&#x27;t want to break up the meeting or nothing, but she&#x27;s something of a cunt, ain&#x27;t she, Doc?&quot;

===Other usage===
In informal British, Irish, New Zealand, and Australian English, and occasionally but to a lesser extent in Canadian English, it can be used with no negative connotations to refer to a (usually male) person. In this sense, it may be modified by a positive qualifier (funny, clever, etc.). For example, &quot;This is my mate Brian. He&#x27;s a good cunt.&quot; In Welsh, (the Welsh equivalent) is sometimes used as a term of endearment, such as the phrase () in Caernarfon.

It can also be used to refer to something very difficult or unpleasant (as in &quot;a cunt of a job&quot;).

In the Survey of English Dialects the word was recorded in some areas as meaning &quot;the vulva of a cow&quot;. This was pronounced as [kʌnt] in Devon, and [kʊnt] in the Isle of Man, Gloucestershire and Northumberland. Possibly related was the word &quot;cunny&quot; [kʌni], with the same meaning, in Wiltshire.

The word &quot;cunty&quot; is also known, although used rarely: a line from Hanif Kureishi&#x27;s &quot;My Beautiful Laundrette&quot; is the definition of England by a Pakistani immigrant as &quot;eating hot buttered toast with cunty fingers&quot;, suggestive of hypocrisy and a hidden sordidness or immorality behind the country&#x27;s quaint façade. This term is attributed to British novelist Henry Green. In the United States, &quot;cunty&quot; is sometimes used in cross-dressing drag ball culture for a drag queen that &quot;projects feminine beauty&quot; and was the title of a hit song by Aviance. A visitor to a New York drag show tells of the emcee praising a queen with &quot;cunty, cunty, cunty&quot; as she walks past.

Rapper Azealia Banks is known for her frequent usage of the word, and her fans are known as the Kunt Brigade. She&#x27;s said in one interview:

In the 2020s, the phrase &quot;serving cunt&quot; (or to &quot;serve cunt&quot;) became popular as a term for acting in a powerfully and unapologetically feminine manner.

===Frequency of use===
Frequency of use varies widely. According to research in 2013 and 2014 by Aston University and the University of South Carolina, based on a corpus of nearly 9 billion words in geotagged tweets, the word was most frequently used in the United States in New England and was least frequently used in the south-eastern states. In Maine, it was the most frequently used &quot;cuss word&quot; after &quot;asshole&quot;.

==Examples of use==
===Literature===

James Joyce was one of the first major 20th-century novelists to put the word &quot;cunt&quot; into print. In the context of one of the central characters in &quot;Ulysses&quot; (1922), Leopold Bloom, Joyce refers to the Dead Sea and to 
Joyce uses the word figuratively rather than literally; but while Joyce used the word only once in &quot;Ulysses&quot;, with four other wordplays (&#x27;cunty&#x27;) on it, D. H. Lawrence later used the word ten times in &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; (1928), in a more direct sense. Mellors, the gamekeeper and eponymous lover, tries delicately to explain the definition of the word to Lady Constance Chatterley: &quot;If your sister there comes ter me for a bit o&#x27; cunt an&#x27; tenderness, she knows what she&#x27;s after.&quot; The novel was the subject of an unsuccessful UK prosecution in 1961 against its publishers, Penguin Books, on grounds of obscenity.

Samuel Beckett was an associate of Joyce, and in his &quot;Malone Dies&quot; (1956), he writes: &quot;His young wife had abandoned all hope of bringing him to heel, by means of her cunt, that trump card of young wives.&quot; In 1998, Inga Muscio published &quot;&quot;. In Ian McEwan&#x27;s novel &quot;Atonement&quot; (2001), set in 1935, the word is used in the draft of a love letter mistakenly sent instead of a revised version and, although not spoken, is an important plot pivot.

Irvine Welsh uses the word widely in his novels, such as &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, generally as a generic placeholder for a man, and not always negatively, e.g. &quot;Ah wis the cunt wi the fuckin pool cue in ma hand, n the plukey cunt could huv the fat end ay it in his pus if he wanted, like.&quot;

===Art===

The word is occasionally used in the titles of works of art, such as Peter Renosa&#x27;s portrait of the pop singer Madonna, &quot;I am the Cunt of Western Civilization&quot;, from a 1990 quote by the singer. One of the first works of Gilbert &amp; George was a self-portrait in 1969 entitled &quot;Gilbert the Shit and George the Cunt&quot;. The London performance art group the Neo Naturists had a song and an act called &quot;Cunt Power&quot;, a name which potter Grayson Perry borrowed for one of his early works: &quot;An unglazed piece of modest dimensions, made from terracotta like clay – labia carefully formed with once wet material, about its midriff&quot;. Australian artist Greg Taylor&#x27;s display of scores of white porcelain vulvas, &quot;CUNTS and other conversations&quot; (2009), was deemed controversial for both its title and content, with Australia Post warning the artist that the publicity postcards were illegal.

===Theatre===
Theatre censorship was effectively abolished in the UK in 1968; prior to that, all theatrical productions had to be vetted by Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Office. English stand-up comedian Roy &quot;Chubby&quot; Brown claims that he was the first person to say the word on stage in the United Kingdom.

===Television===
====United Kingdom====
Broadcast media is regulated for content, and media providers such as the BBC have guidelines which specify how &quot;cunt&quot; and similar words should be treated. In a survey of 2000 commissioned by the British Broadcasting Standards Commission, Independent Television Commission, BBC and Advertising Standards Authority, &quot;cunt&quot; was regarded as the most offensive word which could be heard, above &quot;motherfucker&quot; and &quot;fuck&quot;. Nevertheless, there have been occasions when, particularly in a live broadcast, the word has been aired outside editorial control:
* &quot;The Frost Programme&quot;, broadcast 7 November 1970, was the first time the word was known to have been used on British television, in an aside by Felix Dennis. This incident has since been reshown many times.
* Bernard Manning first said on television the line &quot;They say you are what you eat. I&#x27;m a cunt.&quot;
* &quot;This Morning&quot; broadcast the word in 2000, used by model Caprice Bourret while being interviewed live about her role in &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;.

The first scripted uses of the word on British television occurred in 1979, in the ITV drama &quot;No Mama No&quot;. In &quot;Jerry Springer – The Opera&quot; (BBC, 2005), the suggestion that the Christ character might be gay was found more controversial than the chant describing the Devil as &quot;cunting, cunting, cunting, cunting cunt&quot;.

In July 2007 BBC Three broadcast an hour-long documentary, entitled &quot;The &#x27;C&#x27; Word&quot;, about the origins, use and evolution of the word from the early 1900s to the present day. Presented by British comedian Will Smith, viewers were taken to a street in Oxford once called Gropecunt Lane and presented with examples of the acceptability of &quot;cunt&quot; as a word. (Note that &quot;the C-word&quot; is also a long-standing euphemism for cancer; Lisa Lynch&#x27;s book led to a BBC1 drama, both with that title.)

The &quot;Attitudes to potentially offensive language and gestures on TV and radio&quot; report by Ofcom, based on research conducted by Ipsos MORI, categorised the usage of the word &#x27;cunt&#x27; as a highly unacceptable pre-watershed, but generally acceptable post-watershed, along with &#x27;fuck&#x27; and &#x27;motherfucker&#x27;. Discriminatory words were generally considered as more offensive than the most offensive non-discriminatory words such as &#x27;cunt&#x27; by the UK public, with discriminatory words being more regulated as a result.

====United States====
The first scripted use on US television was on the &quot;Larry Sanders Show&quot; in 1992, and a notable use occurred in &quot;Sex and the City&quot;. In the US, an episode of the NBC TV show &quot;30 Rock&quot;, titled &quot;The C Word&quot;, centered around a subordinate calling protagonist Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) a &quot;cunt&quot; and her subsequent efforts to regain her staff&#x27;s favour. Characters in the popular TV series &quot;The Sopranos&quot; often used the term. Jane Fonda uttered the word on a live airing of the &quot;Today Show&quot;, a network broadcast-TV news program, in 2008 when being interviewed by co-host Meredith Vieira about &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;. Coincidentally, nearly two years later in 2010, also on the &quot;Today Show&quot;, Vieira interviewed a thirteen-year-old girl said the word twice to describe the contents of text messages she was privy to that were central to a well publicised and violent assault. Meredith gently cautioned the girl to choose her words more carefully. As this was a live broadcast on the East Coast, the slurs already were already broadcast, but the producers removed the audio for the Central, Mountain, and Pacific feeds as well as online. Like the Fonda incident, Vieira issued an apology later in the show. Media Critic Thomas Francis commented on what he perceived to be hypocrisy in the media industry:

In 2018, Canadian comedian Samantha Bee had to apologise after calling Ivanka Trump, a White House official and the daughter of US President Donald Trump, a &quot;feckless cunt&quot;.

===Radio===
On 6 December 2010 on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, presenter James Naughtie referred to the British Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt as &quot;Jeremy Cunt&quot;; he later apologised for what the BBC called the inadvertent use of &quot;an offensive four-letter word&quot;. In the programme following, about an hour later, Andrew Marr referred to the incident during &quot;Start the Week&quot; where it was said that &quot;we won&#x27;t repeat the mistake&quot; whereupon Marr slipped up in the same way as Naughtie had.

===Film===

The word&#x27;s first appearance was in graffiti on a wall in the 1969 film &quot;Bronco Bullfrog&quot;. The first spoken use of the word in mainstream cinema occurs in &quot;Carnal Knowledge&quot; (1971), in which Jonathan (Jack Nicholson) asks, &quot;Is this an ultimatum? Answer me, you ball-busting, castrating, son of a cunt bitch! Is this an ultimatum or not?&quot; In the same year, the word was used in the film &quot;Women in Revolt&quot;, in which Holly Woodlawn shouts &quot;I love cunt&quot; whilst avoiding a violent boyfriend. Nicholson later used it again, in &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; (1975). Two early films by Martin Scorsese, &quot;Mean Streets&quot; (1973) and &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976), use the word in the context of the virgin-whore dichotomy, with characters using it after they were rejected (in &quot;Mean Streets&quot;) or after they have slept with the woman (in &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;).

In notable instances, the word has been edited out. &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; (1977) was released in two versions, &quot;R&quot; (Restricted) and &quot;PG&quot; (Parental Guidance), the latter omitting or replacing dialogue such as Tony Manero (John Travolta)&#x27;s comment to Annette (Donna Pescow), &quot;It&#x27;s a decision a girl&#x27;s gotta make early in life, if she&#x27;s gonna be a nice girl or a cunt&quot;. This differential persists, and in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991), Agent Starling (Jodie Foster) meets Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) for the first time and passes the cell of &quot;Multiple Miggs&quot;, who says to Starling: &quot;I can smell your cunt.&quot; In versions of the film edited for television the word is dubbed with the word scent. The 2010 film &quot;Kick-Ass&quot; caused a controversy when the word was used by Hit-Girl because the actress playing the part, Chloë Grace Moretz, was 11 years old at the time of filming.

In Britain, use of the word &quot;cunt&quot; may result in an &quot;18&quot; rating from the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), and this happened to Ken Loach&#x27;s film &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot;, because of an estimated twenty uses of &quot;cunt&quot;. Still, the BBFC&#x27;s guidelines at &quot;15&quot; state that &quot;very strong language may be permitted, depending on the manner in which it is used, who is using the language, its frequency within the work as a whole and any special contextual justification&quot;. Also directed by Loach, &quot;My Name is Joe&quot; was given a 15 certificate despite more than one instance of the word. The 2010 Ian Dury biopic &quot;Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll&quot; was given a &quot;15&quot; rating despite containing seven uses of the word. The BBFC have also allowed it at the &quot;12&quot; level, in the case of well known works such as Hamlet.

===Comedy===
In their Derek and Clive dialogues, Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, particularly Cook, used the word in the 1976 sketch &quot;This Bloke Came Up To Me&quot;, with &quot;cunt&quot; used 35 times. The word is also used extensively by British comedian Roy &#x27;Chubby&#x27; Brown, which ensures that his stand-up act has never been fully shown on UK television.

Australian stand-up comedian Rodney Rude frequently refers to his audiences as &quot;cunts&quot; and makes frequent use of the word in his acts, which got him arrested in Queensland and Western Australia for breaching obscenity laws of those states in the mid-1980s. Australian comedic singer Kevin Bloody Wilson makes extensive use of the word, most notably in the songs &quot;Caring Understanding Nineties Type&quot; and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Say &quot;Cunt&quot; in Canada&quot;.

The word appears in American comic George Carlin&#x27;s 1972 standup routine on the list of the seven dirty words that could not, at that time, be said on American broadcast television, a routine that led to a U.S. Supreme Court decision. While some of the original seven are now heard on US broadcast television from time to time, &quot;cunt&quot; remains generally taboo except on premium paid subscription cable channels like HBO or Showtime. Comedian Louis C.K. uses the term frequently in his stage act as well as on his television show &quot;Louie&quot; on FX network, which bleeps it out.

In 2018, Canadian comedian Samantha Bee had to apologise after calling Ivanka Trump a cunt on American late night TV show &quot;Full Frontal with Samantha Bee&quot;.

===Music===
The 1977 Ian Dury and The Blockheads album, &quot;New Boots and Panties&quot;, used the word in the opening line of the track &quot;Plaistow Patricia&quot;, thus: &quot;Arseholes, bastards, fucking cunts and pricks&quot;, particularly notable as there is no musical lead-in to the lyrics.

In 1979, during a concert at New York&#x27;s Bottom Line, Carlene Carter introduced a song about mate-swapping called &quot;Swap-Meat Rag&quot; by stating, &quot;If this song doesn&#x27;t put the cunt back in country, nothing will.&quot; However use of the word in lyrics is not recorded before the Sid Vicious&#x27;s 1978 version of &quot;My Way&quot;, which marked the first known use of the word in a UK top 10 hit, as a line was changed to &quot;You cunt/I&#x27;m not a queer&quot;. The following year, &quot;cunt&quot; was used more explicitly in the song &quot;Why D&#x27;Ya Do It?&quot; from Marianne Faithfull&#x27;s album &quot;Broken English&quot;: 

The Happy Mondays song, &quot;Kuff Dam&quot; (i.e. &quot;Mad fuck&quot; in reverse), from their 1987 debut album, &quot;Squirrel and G-Man Twenty Four Hour Party People Plastic Face Carnt Smile (White Out)&quot;, includes the lyrics &quot;You see that Jesus is a cunt / And never helped you with a thing that you do, or you don&#x27;t&quot;. Biblical scholar James Crossley, writing in the academic journal, &quot;Biblical Interpretation&quot;, analyses the Happy Mondays&#x27; reference to &quot;Jesus is a cunt&quot; as a description of the &quot;useless assistance&quot; of a now &quot;inadequate Jesus&quot;. A phrase from the same lyric, &quot;Jesus is a cunt&quot; was included on the notorious Cradle of Filth T-shirt which depicted a masturbating nun on the front and the slogan &quot;Jesus is a cunt&quot; in large letters on the back. The T-shirt was banned in New Zealand, in 2008.

Liz Phair in &quot;Dance of Seven Veils&quot; on her 1993 album &quot;Exile in Guyville&quot;, uses the word in the line &quot;I only ask because I&#x27;m a real cunt in spring&quot;.

The word has been used by numerous non-mainstream bands, such as the Australian band TISM, who released an extended play in 1993 &quot;Australia the Lucky Cunt&quot; (a reference to Australia&#x27;s label the &quot;lucky country&quot;). They also released a single in 1998 entitled &quot;I Might Be a Cunt, but I&#x27;m Not a Fucking Cunt&quot;, which was banned. The American grindcore band Anal Cunt, on being signed to a bigger label, shortened their name to AxCx.

===Computer and video games===

The 2004 title &quot;The Getaway: Black Monday&quot; by SCEE used the word several times during the game.

In the 2008 title &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; (developed by Rockstar North and distributed by Take Two Interactive), the word, amongst many other expletives, was used by James Pegorino who, after finding out that his personal bodyguard had turned states, exclaimed &quot;The world is a cunt!&quot; while aiming a shotgun at the player.

==Linguistic variants and derivatives==
Various euphemisms, minced forms and in-jokes are used to imply the word without actually saying it, thereby escaping obvious censure and censorship.

===Spoonerisms===
Deriving from a dirty joke: &quot;What&#x27;s the difference between a circus and a strip club?&quot;- &quot;The circus has a bunch of cunning stunts...&quot;. The phrase &quot;cunning stunt&quot; has been used in popular music. Its first documented appearance was by the English band Caravan, who released the album &quot;Cunning Stunts&quot; in July 1975; the title was later used by Metallica for a CD/Video compilation, and in 1992 the Cows released an album with the same title. In his 1980s BBC television programme, Kenny Everett played a vapid starlet, &quot;Cupid Stunt&quot;.

===Acronyms===
There are numerous informal acronyms, including various apocryphal stories concerning academic establishments, such as the &quot;Cambridge University National Trust Society&quot;.

===Puns===
The name &quot;Mike Hunt&quot; is a frequent pun on &quot;my cunt&quot;; it has been used in a scene from the movie &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot;, and for a character in the BBC radio comedy &quot;Radio Active&quot; in the 1980s. &quot;Has Anyone Seen Mike Hunt?&quot; were the words written on a &quot;pink neon sculpture&quot; representing the letter C, in a 2004 exhibition of the alphabet at the British Library in collaboration with the International Society of Typographic Designers.

As well as obvious references, there are also allusions. On &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;, Stephen Fry once defined &quot;countryside&quot; as the act of &quot;murdering Piers Morgan&quot;.

===Derived meanings===
The word &quot;cunt&quot; forms part of some technical terms used in seafaring and other industries.
* In nautical usage, a cunt splice is a type of rope splice used to join two lines in the rigging of ships. Its name has been bowdlerised since at least 1861, and in more recent times it is commonly referred to as a &quot;cut splice&quot;.
* The &quot;Dictionary of Sea Terms&quot;, found within Dana&#x27;s 1841 maritime compendium &quot;The Seaman&#x27;s Friend&quot;, defines the word cuntline as &quot;the space between the bilges of two casks, stowed side by side. Where one cask is set upon the cuntline between two others, they are stowed &quot;bilge and cuntline&quot;.&quot; The &quot;bilge&quot; of a barrel or cask is the widest point, so when stored together the two casks would produce a curved V-shaped gap. The glossary of &quot;The Ashley Book of Knots&quot; by Clifford Ashley, first published in 1944, defines cuntlines as &quot;the surface seams between the strands of a rope.&quot; Though referring to a different object from Dana&#x27;s definition, it similarly describes the crease formed by two abutting cylinders.
* In US military usage personnel refer privately to a common uniform item, a flat, soft cover (hat) with a fold along the top resembling an invagination, as a cunt cap. The proper name for the item is garrison cap or overseas cap, depending on the organisation in which it is worn.

* Cunt hair (sometimes as red cunt hair) has been used since the late 1950s to signify a very small distance.
* Cunt-eyed has been used to refer to a person with narrow, squinting eyes.

<text>A sleep disorder, or somnipathy, is a medical disorder affecting an individual&#x27;s sleep patterns, sometimes impacting physical, mental, social, and emotional functioning. Polysomnography and actigraphy are tests commonly ordered for diagnosing sleep disorders.

Sleep disorders are broadly classified into dyssomnias, parasomnias, circadian rhythm sleep disorders involving the timing of sleep, and other disorders, including those caused by medical or psychological conditions. When a person struggles to fall asleep or stay asleep without any obvious cause, it is referred to as insomnia, which is the most common sleep disorder. Other sleep disorders include sleep apnea, narcolepsy, hypersomnia (excessive sleepiness at inappropriate times), sleeping sickness (disruption of the sleep cycle due to infection), sleepwalking, and night terrors.

Sleep disruptions can be caused by various issues, including teeth grinding (bruxism) and night terrors. Managing sleep disturbances that are secondary to mental, medical, or substance abuse disorders should focus on addressing the underlying conditions.

Sleep disorders are common in both children and adults. However, there is a significant lack of awareness about sleep disorders in children, with many cases remaining unidentified. Several common factors involved in the onset of a sleep disorder include increased medication use, age-related changes in circadian rhythms, environmental changes, lifestyle changes, pre-diagnosed physiological problems, or stress. Among the elderly, the risk of developing sleep-disordered breathing, periodic limb movements, restless legs syndrome, REM sleep behavior disorders, insomnia, and circadian rhythm disturbances is especially high.

== Causes ==

A systematic review found that traumatic childhood experiences, such as family conflict or sexual trauma, significantly increase the risk of several sleep disorders in adulthood, including sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and insomnia.

An evidence-based synopsis suggests that idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) may have a hereditary component. A total of 632 participants, half with iRBD and half without, completed self-report questionnaires. The study results suggest that people with iRBD are more likely to report having a first-degree relative with the same sleep disorder than people of the same age and sex who do not have the disorder. More research is needed to further understand the hereditary nature of sleep disorders.

A population susceptible to the development of sleep disorders includes people who have experienced a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Due to the significant research focus on this issue, a systematic review was conducted to synthesize the findings. The results indicate that individuals who have experienced a TBI are most disproportionately at risk for developing narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, excessive daytime sleepiness, and insomnia.

== Sleep disorders and neurodegenerative diseases ==
Neurodegenerative diseases are often associated with sleep disorders, particularly when characterized by the abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein, as seen in multiple system atrophy (MSA), Parkinson&#x27;s disease (PD), and Lewy body disease (LBD). For example, individuals diagnosed with PD frequently experience various sleep issues, such as insomnia (affecting approximately 70% of the PD population), hypersomnia (over 50%), and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) (around 40%), which is linked to increased motor symptoms. Moreover, RBD has been identified as a significant precursor for the future development of these neurodegenerative diseases over several years, presenting a promising opportunity for improving treatments.

Neurodegenerative conditions are commonly related to structural brain impairments, which may disrupt sleep and wakefulness, circadian rhythm, and motor or non-motor functioning. Conversely, sleep disturbances are often linked to worsening patients&#x27; cognitive functioning, emotional state, and quality of life. Additionally, these abnormal behavioral symptoms can place a significant burden on their relatives and caregivers. The limited research in this area, coupled with increasing life expectancy, highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the relationship between sleep disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.

=== Sleep disturbances and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease ===
Sleep disturbances have also been observed in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD), affecting about 45% of its population. When based on caregiver reports, this percentage increases to about 70%. As in the PD population, insomnia and hypersomnia are frequently recognized in AD patients. These disturbances have been associated with the accumulation of beta-amyloid, circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSD), and melatonin alteration. Additionally, changes in sleep architecture are observed in AD. Although sleep architecture seems to naturally change with age, its development appears aggravated in AD patients. Slow-wave sleep (SWS) potentially decreases (and is sometimes absent), spindles and the length of time spent in REM sleep are also reduced, while its latency increases. Poor sleep onset in AD has been associated with dream-related hallucinations, increased restlessness, wandering, and agitation related to sundowning—a typical chronobiological phenomenon in the disease.

In Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, in addition to cognitive decline and memory impairment, there are also significant sleep disturbances with modified sleep architecture. These disturbances may consist of sleep fragmentation, reduced sleep duration, insomnia, increased daytime napping, decreased quantity of some sleep stages, and a growing resemblance between some sleep stages (N1 and N2). More than 65% of people with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease experience this type of sleep disturbance.

One factor that could explain this change in sleep architecture is a disruption in the circadian rhythm, which regulates sleep. This disruption can lead to sleep disturbances. Some studies show that people with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease have a delayed circadian rhythm, whereas in normal aging, an advanced circadian rhythm is present.

In addition to these psychological symptoms, there are two main neurological symptoms of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. The first is the accumulation of beta-amyloid waste, forming aggregate &quot;plaques&quot;. The second is the accumulation of tau protein.

It has been shown that the sleep-wake cycle influences the beta-amyloid burden, a central component found in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD). As individuals awaken, the production of beta-amyloid protein becomes more consistent compared to its production during sleep. This phenomenon can be explained by two factors. First, metabolic activity is higher during waking hours, resulting in greater secretion of beta-amyloid protein. Second, oxidative stress increases during waking hours, which leads to greater beta-amyloid production.

On the other hand, it is during sleep that beta-amyloid residues are degraded to prevent plaque formation. The glymphatic system is responsible for this through the phenomenon of glymphatic clearance. Thus, during wakefulness, the beta-amyloid burden is greater because metabolic activity and oxidative stress are higher, and there is no protein degradation by glymphatic clearance. During sleep, the burden is reduced as there is less metabolic activity and oxidative stress, in addition to the glymphatic clearance that occurs.

Glymphatic clearance occurs during NREM SWS sleep, a stage that decreases with normal aging, leading to reduced glymphatic clearance and increased beta-amyloid burden, which forms plaques. Therefore, sleep disturbances in individuals with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease will amplify this phenomenon.

The decrease in the quantity and quality of NREM SWS, along with sleep disturbances, will therefore increase the AB plaques. This initially occurs in the hippocampus, a brain structure integral to long-term memory formation. As hippocampus cell death occurs, it contributes to the diminished memory performance and cognitive decline found in AD.

Although the causal relationship is unclear, the development of AD correlates with the onset of prominent sleep disorders. Similarly, sleep disorders exacerbate disease progression, forming a positive feedback loop. As a result, sleep disturbances are not only a symptom of AD; the relationship between sleep disturbances and AD is bidirectional.

At the same time, it has been shown that memory consolidation in long-term memory, which depends on the hippocampus, occurs during NREM sleep. This indicates that a decrease in NREM sleep will result in less consolidation, leading to poorer memory performance in hippocampal-dependent long-term memory. This drop in performance is one of the central symptoms of AD.

Recent studies have also linked sleep disturbances, neurogenesis, and AD. The subgranular zone and subventricular zone continue to produce new neurons in adult brains. These new cells are then incorporated into neuronal circuits in the subgranular zone, which is found in the hippocampus. These new cells contribute to learning and memory, playing an essential role in hippocampal-dependent memory.

However, recent studies have shown that several factors can interrupt neurogenesis, including stress and prolonged sleep deprivation (more than one day). The sleep disturbances encountered in AD could therefore suppress neurogenesis and impair hippocampal functions. This suppression would contribute to diminished memory performance and the progression of AD, while the progression of AD would further aggravate sleep disturbances.

Changes in sleep architecture in patients with AD occur during the preclinical phase of the disease. These changes could potentially be used to detect those most at risk of developing AD. However, this is still only theoretical.

While the exact mechanisms and causal relationship between sleep disturbances and AD remain unclear, these findings provide a better understanding and offer possibilities to improve targeting of at-risk populations, as well as the implementation of treatments to curb the cognitive decline of AD patients.

== Sleep disorder symptoms in psychiatric illnesses ==

=== Schizophrenia ===
In individuals with psychiatric illnesses sleep disorders may include a variety of clinical symptoms, including but not limited to: excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, nightmares, sleep talking, sleepwalking, and poor sleep quality. Sleep disturbances - insomnia, hypersomnia and delayed sleep-phase disorder - are quite prevalent in severe mental illnesses such as psychotic disorders. In those with schizophrenia, sleep disorders contribute to cognitive deficits in learning and memory. Sleep disturbances often occur before the onset of psychosis.

Sleep deprivation can also produce hallucinations, delusions and depression. A 2019 study investigated the three above-mentioned sleep disturbances in schizophrenia-spectrum (SCZ) and bipolar (BP) disorders in 617 SCZ individuals, 440 BP individuals, and 173 healthy controls (HC). Sleep disturbances were identified using the Inventory for Depressive Symptoms - clinician rated scale (IDS-C). Results suggested that at least one type of sleep disturbance was reported in 78% of the SCZ population, in 69% individuals with BD, and in 39% of healthy controls. The SCZ group reported the most number of sleep disturbances compared to the BD and HC groups; specifically, hypersomnia was more frequent among individuals with SCZ, and delayed sleep phase disorder was three times more common in the SCZ group compared to the BD group. Insomnias were the most frequently reported sleep disturbance across all three groups.

=== Bipolar disorder ===
One of the main behavioral symptoms of bipolar disorder is abnormal sleep. Studies have suggested that 23-78% of individuals with bipolar disorders consistently report symptoms of excessive time spent sleeping, or hypersomnia. The pathogenesis of bipolar disorder, including the higher risk of suicidal ideation, could possibly be linked to circadian rhythm variability, and sleep disturbances are a good predictor of mood swings. The most common sleep-related symptom of bipolar disorder is insomnia, in addition to hypersomnia, nightmares, poor sleep quality, OSA, extreme daytime sleepiness, etc. Moreover, animal models have shown that sleep debt can induce episodes of bipolar mania in laboratory mice, but these models are still limited in their potential to explain bipolar disease in humans with all its multifaceted symptoms, including those related to sleep disturbances.

=== Major depressive disorder (MDD) ===
Sleep disturbances (insomnia or hypersomnia) - though not a necessary diagnostic criterion - are one of the most frequent symptoms of individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD). Among individuals with MDD, insomnia and hypersomnia have prevalence estimates of 88% and 27%, respectively, whereas individuals with insomnia have a threefold increased risk of developing MDD. Depressed mood and sleep efficiency strongly co-vary, and while sleep regulation problems may precede depressive episodes, such depressive episodes may also precipitate sleep deprivation. Fatigue, as well as sleep disturbances such as irregular and excessive sleepiness, are linked to symptoms of depression. Recent research has even pointed to sleep problems and fatigues as potential driving forces bridging MDD symptoms to those of co-occurring generalized anxiety disorder.

== Treatment ==

Treatments for sleep disorders generally can be grouped into four categories:
* Behavioral and psychotherapeutic treatment
* Rehabilitation and management
* Medication
* Other somatic treatment

None of these general approaches are sufficient for all patients with sleep disorders. Rather, the choice of a specific treatment depends on the patient&#x27;s diagnosis, medical and psychiatric history, and preferences, as well as the expertise of the treating clinician. Often, behavioral/psychotherapeutic and pharmacological approaches may be compatible, and can effectively be combined to maximize therapeutic benefits.

Management of sleep disturbances that are secondary to mental, medical, or substance abuse disorders should focus on the underlying conditions. Medications and somatic treatments may provide the most rapid symptomatic relief from certain disorders, such as narcolepsy, which is best treated with prescription drugs such as modafinil. Others, such as chronic and primary insomnia, may be more amenable to behavioral interventions—with more durable results.

Chronic sleep disorders in childhood, which affect some 70% of children with developmental or psychological disorders, are under-reported and under-treated. Sleep-phase disruption is also common among adolescents, whose school schedules are often incompatible with their natural circadian rhythm. Effective treatment begins with careful diagnosis using sleep diaries and perhaps sleep studies. Modifications in sleep hygiene may resolve the problem, but medical treatment is often warranted.

Special equipment may be required for treatment of several disorders such as obstructive apnea, circadian rhythm disorders and bruxism. In severe cases, it may be necessary for individuals to accept living with the disorder, however well managed.

Some sleep disorders have been found to compromise glucose metabolism.

=== Allergy treatment ===
Histamine plays a role in wakefulness in the brain. An allergic reaction over produces histamine, causing wakefulness and inhibiting sleep. Sleep problems are common in people with allergic rhinitis. A study from the N.I.H. found that sleep is dramatically impaired by allergic symptoms, and that the degree of impairment is related to the severity of those symptoms. Treatment of allergies has also been shown to help sleep apnea.

=== Acupuncture ===
A review of the evidence in 2012 concluded that current research is not rigorous enough to make recommendations around the use of acupuncture for insomnia. The pooled results of two trials on acupuncture showed a moderate likelihood that there may be some improvement to sleep quality for individuals with insomnia. This form of treatment for sleep disorders is generally studied in adults, rather than children. Further research would be needed to study the effects of acupuncture on sleep disorders in children.

=== Hypnosis ===
Research suggests that hypnosis may be helpful in alleviating some types and manifestations of sleep disorders in some patients. &quot;Acute and chronic insomnia often respond to relaxation and hypnotherapy approaches, along with sleep hygiene instructions.&quot; Hypnotherapy has also helped with nightmares and sleep terrors. There are several reports of successful use of hypnotherapy for parasomnias specifically for head and body rocking, bedwetting and sleepwalking.

Hypnotherapy has been studied in the treatment of sleep disorders in both adults and children.

=== Music therapy ===

Although more research should be done to increase the reliability of this method of treatment, research suggests that music therapy can improve sleep quality in acute and chronic sleep disorders. In one particular study, participants (18 years or older) who had experienced acute or chronic sleep disorders were put in a randomly controlled trial, and their sleep efficiency, in the form of overall time asleep, was observed. In order to assess sleep quality, researchers used subjective measures (i.e. questionnaires) and objective measures (i.e. polysomnography). The results of the study suggest that music therapy did improve sleep quality in subjects with acute or chronic sleep disorders, though only when tested subjectively. Although these results are not fully conclusive and more research should be conducted, it still provides evidence that music therapy can be an effective treatment for sleep disorders.

In another study specifically looking to help people with insomnia, similar results were seen. The participants that listened to music experienced better sleep quality than those who did not listen to music. Listening to slower pace music before bed can help decrease the heart rate, making it easier to transition into sleep. Studies have indicated that music helps induce a state of relaxation that shifts an individual&#x27;s internal clock towards the sleep cycle. This is said to have an effect on children and adults with various cases of sleep disorders. Music is most effective before bed once the brain has been conditioned to it, helping to achieve sleep much faster.

=== Melatonin ===
Research suggests that melatonin is useful in helping people fall asleep faster (decreased sleep latency), stay asleep longer, and experience improved sleep quality. To test this, a study was conducted that compared subjects who had taken melatonin to subjects with primary sleep disorders who had taken a placebo. Researchers assessed sleep onset latency, total minutes slept, and overall sleep quality in the melatonin and placebo groups to note the differences. In the end, researchers found that melatonin decreased sleep onset latency and increased total sleep time but had an insignificant and inconclusive impact on the quality of sleep compared to the placebo group.

== Sleep medicine ==
Due to rapidly increasing knowledge and understanding of sleep in the 20th century, including the discovery of REM sleep in the 1950s and circadian rhythm disorders in the 70s and 80s, the medical importance of sleep was recognized. By the 1970s in the US, clinics and laboratories devoted to the study of sleep and sleep disorders had been founded, and a need for standards arose. The medical community began paying more attention to primary sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, as well as the role and quality of sleep in other conditions. 
Specialists in sleep medicine were originally and continue to be certified by the American Board of Sleep Medicine. Those passing the Sleep Medicine Specialty Exam received the designation &quot;diplomate of the ABSM&quot;. Sleep medicine is now a recognized subspecialty within internal medicine, family medicine, pediatrics, otolaryngology, psychiatry and neurology in the United States. Certification in Sleep medicine shows that the specialist:

Competence in sleep medicine requires an understanding of a myriad of very diverse disorders. Many of which present with similar symptoms such as excessive daytime sleepiness, which, in the absence of volitional sleep deprivation, &quot;is almost inevitably caused by an identifiable and treatable sleep disorder&quot;, such as sleep apnea, narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, Kleine–Levin syndrome, menstrual-related hypersomnia, idiopathic recurrent stupor, or circadian rhythm disturbances. Another common complaint is insomnia, a set of symptoms which can have a great many different causes, physical and mental. Management in the varying situations differs greatly and cannot be undertaken without a correct diagnosis.

Sleep dentistry (bruxism, snoring and sleep apnea), while not recognized as one of the nine dental specialties, qualifies for board-certification by the American Board of Dental Sleep Medicine (ABDSM). The qualified dentists collaborate with sleep physicians at accredited sleep centers, and can provide oral appliance therapy and upper airway surgery to treat or manage sleep-related breathing disorders. The resulting diplomate status is recognized by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), and these dentists are organized in the Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine (USA).

Occupational therapy is an area of medicine that can also address a diagnosis of sleep disorder, as rest and sleep is listed in the Occupational Therapy Practice Framework (OTPF) as its own occupation of daily living. Rest and sleep are described as restorative in order to support engagement in other occupational therapy occupations. In the OTPF, the occupation of rest and sleep is broken down into rest, sleep preparation, and sleep participation. Occupational therapists have been shown to help improve restorative sleep through the use of assistive devices/equipment, cognitive behavioral therapy for Insomnia, therapeutic activities, and lifestyle interventions.

In the UK, knowledge of sleep medicine and possibilities for diagnosis and treatment seem to lag. The Imperial College Healthcare shows attention to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) and very few other sleep disorders. Some NHS trusts have specialist clinics for respiratory and neurological sleep medicine.

== Epidemiology ==
=== Children and young adults ===
According to one meta-analysis of sleep disorders in children, confusional arousals and sleepwalking are the two most common sleep disorders among children. An estimated 17.3% of kids between 3 and 13 years old experience confusional arousals. About 17% of children sleepwalk, with the disorder being more common among boys than girls, the peak ages of sleepwalking are from 8 to 12 years old.

A different systematic review offers a high range of prevalence rates of sleep bruxism for children. Parasomnias like sleepwalking and talking typically occur during the first part of an individual&#x27;s sleep cycle, the first slow wave of sleep During the first slow wave of sleep period of the sleep cycle the mind and body slow down causing one to feel drowsy and relaxed. At this stage it is the easiest to wake up, therefore many children do not remember what happened during this time.

Nightmares are also considered a parasomnia among children, who typically remember what took place during the nightmare. However, nightmares only occur during the last stage of sleep - Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep. REM is the deepest stage of sleep, it is named for the host of neurological and physiological responses an individual can display during this period of the sleep cycle which are similar to being awake.

Between 15.29% and 38.6% of preschoolers grind their teeth at least one night a week. All but one of the included studies reports decreasing bruxist prevalence as age increased, as well as a higher prevalence among boys than girls.

Another systematic review noted 7-16% of young adults have delayed sleep phase disorder. This disorder reaches peak prevalence when people are in their 20s. Between 20 and 26% of adolescents report a sleep onset latency of greater than 30 minutes. Also, 7-36% have difficulty initiating sleep. Asian teens tend to have a higher prevalence of all of these adverse sleep outcomes—than their North American and European counterparts.

By adulthood, parasomnias can normally be resolved due to a person&#x27;s growth; however, 4% of people have recurring symptoms.

=== Effects of Untreated Sleep Disorders ===
Children and young adults who do not get enough sleep due to sleep disorders also have many other health problems such as obesity and physical problems where it could interfere with everyday life. It is recommended that children and young adults stick to the hours of sleep recommended by the CDC, as it helps increase mental health, physical health, and more.

=== Insomnia ===
Insomnia is a prevalent form of sleep deprivation. Individuals with insomnia may have problems falling asleep, staying asleep, or a combination of both resulting in hyposomnia - i.e. insufficient quantity and poor quality of sleep.

Combining results from 17 studies on insomnia in China, a pooled prevalence of 15.0% is reported for the country. This result is consistent among other East Asian countries; however, this is considerably lower than a series of Western countries (50.5% in Poland, 37.2% in France and Italy, 27.1% in USA). Men and women residing in China experience insomnia at similar rates.

A separate meta-analysis focusing on this sleeping disorder in the elderly mentions that those with more than one physical or psychiatric malady experience it at a 60% higher rate than those with one condition or less. It also notes a higher prevalence of insomnia in women over the age of 50 than their male counterparts.

A study that was resulted from a collaboration between Massachusetts General Hospital and Merck describes the development of an algorithm to identify patients with sleep disorders using electronic medical records. The algorithm that incorporated a combination of structured and unstructured variables identified more than 36,000 individuals with physician-documented insomnia.

Insomnia can start off at the basic level but about 40% of people who struggle with insomnia have worse symptoms. There are treatments that can help with insomnia and that includes medication, planning out a sleep schedule, limiting oneself from caffeine intake, and cognitive behavioral therapy.

=== Obstructive sleep apnea ===

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects around 4% of men and 2% of women in the United States. In general, this disorder is more prevalent among men. However, this difference tends to diminish with age. Women experience the highest risk for OSA during pregnancy, and tend to report experiencing depression and insomnia in conjunction with obstructive sleep apnea.

In a meta-analysis of the various Asian countries, India and China present the highest prevalence of the disorder. Specifically, about 13.7% of the Indian population and 7% of Hong Kong&#x27;s population is estimated to have OSA. The two groups in the study experience daytime OSA symptoms such as difficulties concentrating, mood swings, or high blood pressure, at similar rates (prevalence of 3.5% and 3.57%, respectively).

=== Obesity and Sleep Apnea ===
The worldwide incidence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is on the rise, largely due to the increasing prevalence of obesity in society. In individuals who are obese, excess fat deposits in the upper respiratory tract can lead to breathing difficulties during sleep, giving rise to OSA. There is a strong connection between obesity and OSA, making it essential to screen obese individuals for OSA and related disorders. Moreover, both obesity and OSA patients are at higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome. Implementing dietary control in obese individuals can have a positive impact on sleep problems and can help alleviate associated issues such as depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Obesity can influence the disturbance in sleep patterns resulting in OSA. Obesity is a risk factor for OSA because it can affect the upper respiratory system by accumulating fat deposition around the muscles surrounding the lungs. Additionally, OSA can irritate the obesity by prolonging sleepiness throughout the day leading to reduces physical activity and an inactive lifestyle. 

=== Sleep paralysis ===
A systematic review states 7.6% of the general population experiences sleep paralysis at least once in their lifetime. Its prevalence among men is 15.9%, while 18.9% of women experience it.

When considering specific populations, 28.3% of students and 31.9% of psychiatric patients have experienced this phenomenon at least once in their lifetime. Of those psychiatric patients, 34.6% have panic disorder. Sleep paralysis in students is slightly more prevalent for those of Asian descent (39.9%) than other ethnicities (Hispanic: 34.5%, African descent: 31.4%, Caucasian 30.8%).

=== Restless legs syndrome ===
According to one meta-analysis, the average prevalence rate for North America, and Western Europe is estimated to be 14.5±8.0%. Specifically in the United States, the prevalence of restless legs syndrome is estimated to be between 5% and 15.7% when using strict diagnostic criteria. RLS is over 35% more prevalent in American women than their male counterparts. Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder characterized by discomfort in the lower limbs. Typically, symptoms worsen in the evening, improve with movement, and exacerbate when at rest.

==List of conditions==
There are a numerous sleep disorders. The following list includes some of them:
* Bruxism, involuntary grinding or clenching of the teeth while sleeping.
* Catathrenia, nocturnal groaning during prolonged exhalation.
* Delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD), inability to awaken and fall asleep at socially acceptable times but no problem with sleep maintenance, a disorder of circadian rhythms. Other such disorders are advanced sleep phase disorder (ASPD), non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder (non-24) in the sighted or in the blind, and irregular sleep wake rhythm, all much less common than DSPD, as well as the situational shift work sleep disorder.
* Fatal familial insomnia, an extremely rare and universally-fatal prion disease that causes a complete cessation of sleep.
* Hypopnea syndrome, abnormally shallow breathing or slow respiratory rate while sleeping.
* Idiopathic hypersomnia, a primary, neurologic cause of long-sleeping, sharing many similarities with narcolepsy.
* Insomnia disorder (primary insomnia), chronic difficulty in falling asleep or maintaining sleep when no other cause is found for these symptoms. Insomnia can also be comorbid with or secondary to other disorders.
* Kleine–Levin syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by persistent episodic hypersomnia and cognitive or mood changes.
* Narcolepsy, characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and so-called &quot;sleep attacks&quot;, relatively sudden-onset, irresistible urges to sleep, which may interfere with occupational and social commitments. About 70% of those who have narcolepsy also have cataplexy, a sudden weakness in the motor muscles that can result in collapse to the floor while retaining full conscious awareness.
* Night terror, &quot;Pavor nocturnus&quot;, sleep terror disorder, an abrupt awakening from sleep with behavior consistent with terror.
* Nocturia, a frequent need to get up and urinate at night. It differs from enuresis, or bed-wetting, in which the person does not arouse from sleep, but the bladder nevertheless empties.
* Parasomnias, disruptive sleep-related events involving inappropriate actions during sleep, for example sleepwalking, night-terrors and catathrenia.
* Periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS), sudden involuntary movement of the arms or legs during sleep. In the absence of other sleep disorders, PLMS may cause sleep disruption and impair sleep quality, leading to periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD).
* Other limb movements in sleep, including hypneic jerks and nocturnal myoclonus.
* Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), acting out violent or dramatic dreams while in REM sleep, sometimes injuring bed partner or self (REM sleep disorder or RSD).
* Restless legs syndrome (RLS), an irresistible urge to move legs.
* Shift work sleep disorder (SWSD), a situational circadian rhythm sleep disorder. (Jet lag was previously included as a situational circadian rhythm sleep disorder, but it does not appear in DSM-5, see Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders for more).
* Sleep apnea, obstructive sleep apnea, obstruction of the airway during sleep, causing lack of sufficient deep sleep, often accompanied by snoring. Other forms of sleep apnea are less common. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a medical disorder that is caused by repetitive collapse of the upper airway (back of the throat) during sleep. For the purposes of sleep studies, episodes of full upper airway collapse for at least ten seconds are called apneas.
* Sleep paralysis, characterized by temporary paralysis of the body shortly before or after sleep. Sleep paralysis may be accompanied by visual, auditory or tactile hallucinations. It is not a disorder unless severe, and is often seen as part of narcolepsy.
* Sleepwalking or &quot;somnambulism&quot;, engaging in activities normally associated with wakefulness (such as eating or dressing), which may include walking, without the conscious knowledge of the subject.
* Somniphobia, one cause of sleep deprivation, a dread/ fear of falling asleep or going to bed. Signs of the illness include anxiety and panic attacks before and during attempts to sleep.

== Types ==
* Dyssomnias – A broad category of sleep disorders characterized by either hypersomnia or insomnia. The three major subcategories include intrinsic (i.e., arising from within the body), extrinsic (secondary to environmental conditions or various pathologic conditions), and disturbances of circadian rhythm.
** Insomnia: Insomnia may be primary or it may be comorbid with or secondary to another disorder such as a mood disorder (i.e., emotional stress, anxiety, depression) or underlying health condition (i.e., asthma, diabetes, heart disease, pregnancy or neurological conditions).
** Primary hypersomnia: Hypersomnia of central or brain origin
*** Narcolepsy: A chronic neurological disorder (or dyssomnia), which is caused by the brain&#x27;s inability to control sleep and wakefulness.
*** Idiopathic hypersomnia: A chronic neurological disease similar to narcolepsy, in which there is an increased amount of fatigue and sleep during the day. Patients who have idiopathic hypersomnia cannot obtain a healthy amount of sleep for a regular day of activities. This hinders the patients&#x27; ability to perform well, and patients have to deal with this for the rest of their lives.
*** Recurrent hypersomnia, including Kleine–Levin syndrome
*** Post traumatic hypersomnia
*** Menstrual-related hypersomnia
** Sleep disordered breathing (SDB), including (non-exhaustive):
*** Several types of sleep apnea
*** Snoring
*** Upper airway resistance syndrome
** Restless leg syndrome
** Periodic limb movement disorder
* Circadian rhythm sleep disorders
** Delayed sleep phase disorder
** Advanced sleep phase disorder
** Non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder
* Parasomnias – A category of sleep disorders that involve abnormal and unnatural movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, and dreams in connection with sleep.
** Bedwetting or sleep enuresis
** Bruxism (Tooth-grinding)
** Catathrenia – nocturnal groaning
** Exploding head syndrome – Waking up in the night hearing loud noises.
** Sleep terror (or Pavor nocturnus) – Characterized by a sudden arousal from deep sleep with a scream or cry, accompanied by some behavioral manifestations of intense fear.
** REM sleep behavior disorder
** Sleepwalking (or somnambulism)
** Sleep talking (or somniloquy)
** Sleep sex (or sexsomnia)
* Medical or psychiatric conditions that may produce sleep disorders
** 22q11.2 deletion syndrome
** Alcoholism
** Mood disorders
*** Depression
** Anxiety disorder
** Nightmare disorder
** Panic
** Dissociative identity disorder
** Psychosis (such as Schizophrenia)
* Sleeping sickness – a parasitic disease which can be transmitted by the Tsetse fly.
* Jet lag disorder – Jet lag disorder is a type of circadian rhythm sleep disorder that results from rapid travel across multiple time zones. Individuals experiencing jet lag may encounter symptoms such as excessive sleepiness, fatigue, insomnia, irritability, and gastrointestinal disturbances upon reaching their destination. These symptoms arise due to the mismatch between the body&#x27;s circadian rhythm, synchronized with the departure location, and the new sleep/wake cycle needed at the destination.

<text>Castalia (), in ancient Greek and Roman literature, was the name of a spring near Delphi, sacred to the Muses; it is also known as the Castalian Spring. It is said to have derived its name from Castalia, a naiad-nymph, daughter of the river-god Achelous, who is said to have flung herself into the spring when pursued by the god Apollo.

== Mythology ==
In older traditions, the Castalian Spring already existed by the time Apollo came to Delphi searching for Python. According to some, the water was a gift to Castalia from the river Cephisus. 

In his commentary on Statius&#x27;s &quot;Thebaid&quot;, Latin poet Lactantius Placidus says that to escape Apollo&#x27;s amorous advances, Castalia transformed herself into a fountain at Delphi, at the base of Mount Parnassus, or at Mount Helicon. Castalia then became the sacred fountain of Poseidon. She inspired the genius of poetry to those who drank her waters or listened to their quiet sound; the sacred water was also used to clean the Delphian temples. Apollo consecrated Castalia to the Muses (&quot;Castaliae Musae&quot;).

The 20th-century German writer Hermann Hesse used Castalia as inspiration for the name of the futuristic fictional utopia in his 1943 magnum opus &quot;The Glass Bead Game&quot;. Castalia is home to an austere order of intellectuals with a twofold mission: to run boarding schools for boys, and to nurture and play the Glass Bead Game.

<text>Pollen is a powdery substance produced by most types of flowers of seed plants for the purpose of sexual reproduction. It consists of pollen grains (highly reduced microgametophytes), which produce male gametes (sperm cells). 

Pollen grains have a hard coat made of sporopollenin that protects the gametophytes during the process of their movement from the stamens to the pistil of flowering plants, or from the male cone to the female cone of gymnosperms. If pollen lands on a compatible pistil or female cone, it germinates, producing a pollen tube that transfers the sperm to the ovule containing the female gametophyte. Individual pollen grains are small enough to require magnification to see detail. The study of pollen is called palynology and is highly useful in paleoecology, paleontology, archaeology, and forensics. 

Pollen in plants is used for transferring haploid male genetic material from the anther of a single flower to the stigma of another in cross-pollination. In a case of self-pollination, this process takes place from the anther of a flower to the stigma of the same flower.

Pollen is infrequently used as food and food supplement. Because of agricultural practices, it is often contaminated by agricultural pesticides.

==Structure and formation== 
Pollen itself is not the male gamete. It is a gametophyte, something that could be considered an entire organism, which then produces the male gamete. Each pollen grain contains vegetative (non-reproductive) cells (only a single cell in most flowering plants but several in other seed plants) and a generative (reproductive) cell. In flowering plants the vegetative tube cell produces the pollen tube, and the generative cell divides to form the two sperm nuclei.

Pollen grains come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and surface markings characteristic of the species (see electron micrograph, right). Pollen grains of pines, firs, and spruces are winged. The smallest pollen grain, that of the forget-me-not (&quot;Myosotis&quot; spp.), is 2.5–5 μm (0.005 mm) in diameter. Corn pollen grains are large, about 90–100 μm. Most grass pollen is around 20–25 μm. Some pollen grains are based on geodesic polyhedra like a soccer ball.

=== Formation ===
Pollen is produced in the microsporangia in the male cone of a conifer or other gymnosperm or in the anthers of an angiosperm flower.
In angiosperms, during flower development the anther is composed of a mass of cells that appear undifferentiated, except for a partially differentiated dermis. As the flower develops, fertile sporogenous cells, the archespore, form within the anther. The sporogenous cells are surrounded by layers of sterile cells that grow into the wall of the pollen sac. Some of the cells grow into nutritive cells that supply nutrition for the microspores that form by meiotic division from the sporogenous cells. The archespore cells divide by mitosis and differentiate to form pollen mother cells (microsporocyte, meiocyte).

In a process called microsporogenesis, four haploid microspores are produced from each diploid pollen mother cell, after meiotic division. After the formation of the four microspores, which are contained by callose walls, the development of the pollen grain walls begins. The callose wall is broken down by an enzyme called callase and the freed pollen grains grow in size and develop their characteristic shape and form a resistant outer wall called the exine and an inner wall called the intine. The exine is what is preserved in the fossil record. 

Two basic types of microsporogenesis are recognised, simultaneous and successive. In simultaneous microsporogenesis meiotic steps I and II are completed before cytokinesis, whereas in successive microsporogenesis cytokinesis follows. While there may be a continuum with intermediate forms, the type of microsporogenesis has systematic significance. The predominant form amongst the monocots is successive, but there are important exceptions.

During microgametogenesis, the unicellular microspores undergo mitosis and develop into mature microgametophytes containing the gametes. In some flowering plants, germination of the pollen grain may begin even before it leaves the microsporangium, with the generative cell forming the two sperm cells.

=== Structure ===

Except in the case of some submerged aquatic plants, the mature pollen grain has a double wall. The vegetative and generative cells are surrounded by a thin delicate wall of unaltered cellulose called the endospore or intine, and a tough resistant outer cuticularized wall composed largely of sporopollenin called the exospore or exine. The exine often bears spines or warts, or is variously sculptured, and the character of the markings is often of value for identifying genus, species, or even cultivar or individual. 

The spines may be less than a micron in length (spinulus, plural spinuli) referred to as spinulose (scabrate), or longer than a micron (echina, echinae) referred to as echinate. Various terms also describe the sculpturing such as reticulate, a net like appearance consisting of elements (murus, muri) separated from each other by a lumen (plural lumina). These reticulations may also be referred to as brochi.

The pollen wall protects the sperm while the pollen grain is moving from the anther to the stigma; it protects the vital genetic material from drying out and solar radiation. The pollen grain surface is covered with waxes and proteins, which are held in place by structures called sculpture elements on the surface of the grain. The outer pollen wall, which prevents the pollen grain from shrinking and crushing the genetic material during desiccation, is composed of two layers. These two layers are the tectum and the foot layer, which is just above the intine. The tectum and foot layer are separated by a region called the columella, which is composed of strengthening rods. The outer wall is constructed with a resistant biopolymer called sporopollenin.

Pollen apertures are regions of the pollen wall that may involve exine thinning or a significant reduction in exine thickness. They allow shrinking and swelling of the grain caused by changes in moisture content. The process of shrinking the grain is called harmomegathy. Elongated apertures or furrows in the pollen grain are called colpi (singular: colpus) or sulci (singular: sulcus). Apertures that are more circular are called pores. Colpi, sulci and pores are major features in the identification of classes of pollen. Pollen may be referred to as inaperturate (apertures absent) or aperturate (apertures present). 

The aperture may have a lid (operculum), hence is described as operculate. However the term inaperturate covers a wide range of morphological types, such as functionally inaperturate (cryptoaperturate) and omniaperturate. Inaperaturate pollen grains often have thin walls, which facilitates pollen tube germination at any position. Terms such as uniaperturate and triaperturate refer to the number of apertures present (one and three respectively). Spiraperturate refers to one or more apertures being spirally shaped.

The orientation of furrows (relative to the original tetrad of microspores) classifies the pollen as sulcate or colpate. Sulcate pollen has a furrow across the middle of what was the outer face when the pollen grain was in its tetrad. If the pollen has only a single sulcus, it is described as monosulcate, has two sulci, as bisulcate, or more, as polysulcate. Colpate pollen has furrows other than across the middle of the outer faces, and similarly may be described as polycolpate if more than two. Syncolpate pollen grains have two or more colpi that are fused at the ends. Eudicots have pollen with three colpi (tricolpate) or with shapes that are evolutionarily derived from tricolpate pollen. The evolutionary trend in plants has been from monosulcate to polycolpate or polyporate pollen.

Additionally, gymnosperm pollen grains often have air bladders, or vesicles, called sacci. The sacci are not actually balloons, but are sponge-like, and increase the buoyancy of the pollen grain and help keep it aloft in the wind, as most gymnosperms are anemophilous. Pollen can be monosaccate, (containing one saccus) or bisaccate (containing two sacci). Modern pine, spruce, and yellowwood trees all produce saccate pollen.

==Pollination==


The transfer of pollen grains to the female reproductive structure (pistil in angiosperms) is called pollination. Pollen transfer is frequently portrayed as a sequential process that begins with placement on the vector, moves through travel, and ends with deposition. This transfer can be mediated by the wind, in which case the plant is described as anemophilous (literally wind-loving). Anemophilous plants typically produce great quantities of very lightweight pollen grains, sometimes with air-sacs. 

Non-flowering seed plants (e.g., pine trees) are characteristically anemophilous. Anemophilous flowering plants generally have inconspicuous flowers. Entomophilous (literally insect-loving) plants produce pollen that is relatively heavy, sticky and protein-rich, for dispersal by insect pollinators attracted to their flowers. Many insects and some mites are specialized to feed on pollen, and are called palynivores.

In non-flowering seed plants, pollen germinates in the pollen chamber, located beneath the micropyle, underneath the integuments of the ovule. A pollen tube is produced, which grows into the nucellus to provide nutrients for the developing sperm cells. Sperm cells of Pinophyta and Gnetophyta are without flagella, and are carried by the pollen tube, while those of Cycadophyta and Ginkgophyta have many flagella.

When placed on the stigma of a flowering plant, under favorable circumstances, a pollen grain puts forth a pollen tube, which grows down the tissue of the style to the ovary, and makes its way along the placenta, guided by projections or hairs, to the micropyle of an ovule. The nucleus of the tube cell has meanwhile passed into the tube, as does also the generative nucleus, which divides (if it has not already) to form two sperm cells. The sperm cells are carried to their destination in the tip of the pollen tube. Double-strand breaks in DNA that arise during pollen tube growth appear to be efficiently repaired in the generative cell that carries the male genomic information to be passed on to the next plant generation. However, the vegetative cell that is responsible for tube elongation appears to lack this DNA repair capability.

==In the fossil record==

The sporopollenin outer sheath of pollen grains affords them some resistance to the rigours of the fossilisation process that destroy weaker objects; it is also produced in huge quantities. There is an extensive fossil record of pollen grains, often disassociated from their parent plant. The discipline of palynology is devoted to the study of pollen, which can be used both for biostratigraphy and to gain information about the abundance and variety of plants alive — which can itself yield important information about paleoclimates. Also, pollen analysis has been widely used for reconstructing past changes in vegetation and their associated drivers.
Pollen is first found in the fossil record in the late Devonian period, but at that time it is indistinguishable from spores. It increases in abundance until the present day.

==Allergy to pollen==

Nasal allergy to pollen is called pollinosis, and allergy specifically to grass pollen is called hay fever. Generally, pollens that cause allergies are those of anemophilous plants (pollen is dispersed by air currents.) Such plants produce large quantities of lightweight pollen (because wind dispersal is random and the likelihood of one pollen grain landing on another flower is small), which can be carried for great distances and are easily inhaled, bringing it into contact with the sensitive nasal passages.

Pollen allergies are common in polar and temperate climate zones, where production of pollen is seasonal. In the tropics pollen production varies less by the season, and allergic reactions less.
In northern Europe, common pollens for allergies are those of birch and alder, and in late summer wormwood and different forms of hay. Grass pollen is also associated with asthma exacerbations in some people, a phenomenon termed thunderstorm asthma.

In the US, people often mistakenly blame the conspicuous goldenrod flower for allergies. Since this plant is entomophilous (its pollen is dispersed by animals), its heavy, sticky pollen does not become independently airborne. Most late summer and fall pollen allergies are probably caused by ragweed, a widespread anemophilous plant.

Arizona was once regarded as a haven for people with pollen allergies, although several ragweed species grow in the desert. However, as suburbs grew and people began establishing irrigated lawns and gardens, more irritating species of ragweed gained a foothold and Arizona lost its claim of freedom from hay fever.

Anemophilous spring blooming plants such as oak, birch, hickory, pecan, and early summer grasses may also induce pollen allergies. Most cultivated plants with showy flowers are entomophilous and do not cause pollen allergies.

Symptoms of pollen allergy include sneezing, itchy, or runny nose, nasal congestion, red, itchy, and watery eyes. Substances, including pollen, that cause allergies can trigger asthma. A study found a 54% increased chance of asthma attacks when exposed to pollen.

The number of people in the United States affected by hay fever is between 20 and 40 million, including around 6.1 million children and such allergy has proven to be the most frequent allergic response in the nation. Hay fever affects about 20% of Canadians and the prevalence is increasing. There are certain evidential suggestions pointing out hay fever and similar allergies to be of hereditary origin. Individuals who suffer from eczema or are asthmatic tend to be more susceptible to developing long-term hay fever.

Since 1990, pollen seasons have gotten longer and more pollen-filled, and climate change is responsible, according to a new study. The researchers attributed roughly half of the lengthening pollen seasons and 8% of the trend in pollen concentrations to climate changes driven by human activity.

In Denmark, decades of rising temperatures cause pollen to appear earlier and in greater amounts, exacerbated by the introduction of new species such as ragweed.

The most efficient way to handle a pollen allergy is by preventing contact with the material. Individuals carrying the ailment may at first believe that they have a simple summer cold, but hay fever becomes more evident when the apparent cold does not disappear. The confirmation of hay fever can be obtained after examination by a general physician.

===Treatment===

Antihistamines are effective at treating mild cases of pollinosis; this type of non-prescribed drugs includes loratadine, cetirizine and chlorpheniramine. They do not prevent the discharge of histamine, but it has been proven that they do prevent a part of the chain reaction activated by this biogenic amine, which considerably lowers hay fever symptoms.

Decongestants can be administered in different ways such as tablets and nasal sprays.

Allergy immunotherapy (AIT) treatment involves administering doses of allergens to accustom the body to pollen, thereby inducing specific long-term tolerance. Allergy immunotherapy can be administered orally (as sublingual tablets or sublingual drops), or by injections under the skin (subcutaneous). Discovered by Leonard Noon and John Freeman in 1911, allergy immunotherapy represents the only causative treatment for respiratory allergies.

==Nutrition==
Most major classes of predatory and parasitic arthropods contain species that eat pollen, despite the common perception that bees are the primary pollen-consuming arthropod group. Many Hymenoptera other than bees consume pollen as adults, though only a small number feed on pollen as larvae (including some ant larvae). Spiders are normally considered carnivores but pollen is an important source of food for several species, particularly for spiderlings, which catch pollen on their webs. It is not clear how spiderlings manage to eat pollen however, since their mouths are not large enough to consume pollen grains. Some predatory mites also feed on pollen, with some species being able to subsist solely on pollen, such as &quot;Euseius tularensis&quot;, which feeds on the pollen of dozens of plant species. Members of some beetle families such as Mordellidae and Melyridae feed almost exclusively on pollen as adults, while various lineages within larger families such as Curculionidae, Chrysomelidae, Cerambycidae, and Scarabaeidae are pollen specialists even though most members of their families are not (e.g., only 36 of 40,000 species of ground beetles, which are typically predatory, have been shown to eat pollen—but this is thought to be a severe underestimate as the feeding habits are only known for 1,000 species). Similarly, Ladybird beetles mainly eat insects, but many species also eat pollen, as either part or all of their diet. Hemiptera are mostly herbivores or omnivores but pollen feeding is known (and has only been well studied in the Anthocoridae). Many adult flies, especially Syrphidae, feed on pollen, and three UK syrphid species feed strictly on pollen (syrphids, like all flies, cannot eat pollen directly due to the structure of their mouthparts, but can consume pollen contents that are dissolved in a fluid). Some species of fungus, including &quot;Fomes fomentarius&quot;, are able to break down grains of pollen as a secondary nutrition source that is particularly high in nitrogen. Pollen may be valuable diet supplement for detritivores, providing them with nutrients needed for growth, development and maturation. It was suggested that obtaining nutrients from pollen, deposited on the forest floor during periods of pollen rains, allows fungi to decompose nutritionally scarce litter.

Some species of &quot;Heliconius&quot; butterflies consume pollen as adults, which appears to be a valuable nutrient source, and these species are more distasteful to predators than the non-pollen consuming species.

Although bats, butterflies, and hummingbirds are not pollen eaters &quot;per se&quot;, their consumption of nectar in flowers is an important aspect of the pollination process.

===In humans===
Bee pollen for human consumption is marketed as a food ingredient and as a dietary supplement. The largest constituent is carbohydrates, with protein content ranging from 7 to 35 percent depending on the plant species collected by bees.

Honey produced by bees from natural sources contains pollen derived p-coumaric acid, an antioxidant and natural bactericide that is also present in a wide variety of plants and plant-derived food products.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not found any harmful effects of bee pollen consumption, except for the usual allergies. However, FDA does not allow bee pollen marketers in the United States to make health claims about their produce, as no scientific basis for these has ever been proven. Furthermore, there are possible dangers not only from allergic reactions but also from contaminants such as pesticides and from fungi and bacteria growth related to poor storage procedures. A manufacturers&#x27;s claim that pollen collecting helps the bee colonies is also controversial.

Pine pollen () is traditionally consumed in Korea as an ingredient in sweets and beverages. Māori of precolonial New Zealand would gather pollen of &quot;Typha orientalis&quot; to make a special bread called &quot;pungapunga&quot;.

===Parasites===
The growing industries in pollen harvesting for human and bee consumption rely on harvesting pollen baskets from honey bees as they return to their hives using a &quot;pollen trap&quot;. When this pollen has been tested for parasites, it has been found that a multitude of viruses and eukaryotic parasites are present in the pollen. It is currently unclear if the parasites are introduced by the bee that collected the pollen or if it is from the flower. Though this is not likely to pose a risk to humans, it is a major issue for the bumblebee rearing industry that relies on thousands of tonnes of honey bee collected pollen per year. Several sterilization methods have been employed, though no method has been 100% effective at sterilisation without reducing the nutritional value of the pollen 

==Forensic palynology==
In forensic biology, pollen can tell a lot about where a person or object has been, because regions of the world, or even more particular locations such a certain set of bushes, will have a distinctive collection of pollen species. Pollen evidence can also reveal the season in which a particular object picked up the pollen. Pollen has been used to trace activity at mass graves from the Bosnian War, catch a burglar who brushed against a &quot;Hypericum&quot; bush during a crime, and has even been proposed as an additive for bullets to enable tracking them.

== Spiritual purposes ==
In some Native American religions, pollen was used in prayers and rituals to symbolize life and renewal by sanctifying objects, dancing grounds, trails, and sandpaintings. It may also be sprinkled over heads or in mouths. Many Navajo people believed the body became holy when it traveled over a trail sprinkled with pollen.

== Pollen grain staining ==

For agricultural research purposes, assessing the viability of pollen grains can be necessary and illuminating. A very common, efficient method to do so is known as Alexander&#x27;s stain. This differential stain consists of ethanol, malachite green, distilled water, glycerol, phenol, chloral hydrate, acid fuchsin, orange G, and glacial acetic acid. (A less-toxic variation omits the phenol and chloral hydrate.) In angiosperms and gymnosperms non-aborted pollen grain will appear red or pink, and aborted pollen grains will appear blue or slightly green.

<text>Scutum is a small constellation. Its name is Latin for shield, and it was originally named Scutum Sobiescianum by Johannes Hevelius in 1684. Located just south of the celestial equator, its four brightest stars form a narrow diamond shape. It is one of the 88 IAU designated constellations defined in 1922.

==History==
Scutum was named in 1684 by Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius (Jan Heweliusz), who originally named it &quot;Scutum Sobiescianum&quot; (Shield of Sobieski) to commemorate the victory of the Christian forces led by Polish King John III Sobieski (Jan III Sobieski) in the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Later, the name was shortened to Scutum.

Five bright stars of Scutum (α Sct, β Sct, δ Sct, ε Sct and η Sct) were previously known as 1, 6, 2, 3, and 9 Aquilae respectively.

The constellation of Scutum was adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922 as one of the 88 constellations covering the entire sky, with the official abbreviation of &quot;Sct&quot;. The constellation boundaries are defined by a quadrilateral. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between −3.83° and −15.94°.

Coincidentally, the Chinese also associated these stars with battle armor, incorporating them into the larger asterism known as &quot;Tien Pien&quot;, i.e., the Heavenly Casque (or Helmet).

==Features==

===Stars===

Scutum is not a bright constellation, with the brightest star, Alpha Scuti, being a K-type giant star at magnitude 3.85. However, some stars are notable in the constellation. Beta Scuti is the second brightest at magnitude 4.22, followed by Delta Scuti at magnitude 4.72. It is also known as 6 Aquilae. Beta Scuti is a binary system, with the primary with a spectral type similar to the Sun, although it is 1,270 times brighter. Delta Scuti is a bluish white giant star, which is now coming at the direction of the Solar System. Within 1.3 million years it will come as close to 10 light years from Earth, and will be much brighter than Sirius by that time.

UY Scuti is a red supergiant and is also one of the largest stars currently known with a radius over 900 times that of the Sun. RSGC1-F01 is another red supergiant whose radius is over 1,450 times that of the Sun. Scutum contains several clusters of supergiant stars, including RSGC1, Stephenson 2 and RSGC3.

===Deep sky objects===

Although not a large constellation, Scutum contains several open clusters, as well as a globular cluster and a planetary nebula. The two best known deep sky objects in Scutum are M11 (the Wild Duck Cluster) and the open cluster M26 (NGC 6694). The globular cluster NGC 6712 and the planetary nebula IC 1295 can be found in the eastern part of the constellation, only 24 arcminutes apart.

The most prominent open cluster in Scutum is the Wild Duck Cluster, M11. It was named by William Henry Smyth in 1844 for its resemblance in the eyepiece to a flock of ducks in flight. The cluster, 6200 light-years from Earth and 20 light-years in diameter, contains approximately 3000 stars, making it a particularly rich cluster. It is around 220 million years old, although some studies give older estimates. Estimates for the mass of the star cluster range from to .

== Space exploration ==
The space probe Pioneer 11 is moving in the direction of this constellation. It will not near the closest star in this constellation for over a million years at its present speed, by which time its batteries will be long dead.

<doc id="46982" wikidata="Q1056835" url="?curid=46982" title="Transmission system">
<text>In telecommunications, a transmission system is a system that transmits a signal from one place to another. The signal can be an electrical, optical or radio signal. The goal of a transmission system is to transmit data accurately and efficiently from point A to point B over a distance, using a variety of technologies such as copper cable and fiber-optic cables, satellite links, and wireless communication technologies.

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) define a transmission system as the interface and medium through which peer physical layer entities transfer bits. It encompasses all the components and technologies involved in transmitting digital data from one location to another, including modems, cables, and other networking equipment.
Some transmission systems contain multipliers, which amplify a signal prior to re-transmission, or regenerators, which attempt to reconstruct and re-shape the coded message before re-transmission.

One of the most widely used transmission system technologies in the Internet and the public switched telephone network (PSTN) is synchronous optical networking (SONET).

Also, transmission system is the medium through which data is transmitted from one point to another. Examples of common transmission systems people use everyday are: the internet, mobile networks, cordless cables, etc.

==Digital transmission system==
The ITU defines a digital transmission system as a system that uses digital signals to transmit information. In a digital transmission system, the data is first converted into a digital format and then transmitted over a communication channel. The digital format provides a number of benefits over analog transmission systems, including improved signal quality, reduced noise and interference, and increased data accuracy.

ITU defines digital transmission system (DTS) as following:A specific means of providing a digital section.The ITU sets global standards for digital transmission systems, including the encoding and decoding methods used, the data rates and transmission speeds, and the types of communication channels used. These standards ensure that digital transmission systems are compatible and interoperable with each other, regardless of the type of data being transmitted or the geographical location of the sender and receiver.

===Basic components of a DTS===
* Point-to-point links are communication systems between two endpoints, usually a sender (transmitter) and a receiver.
** System performance analysis:
*** Link power budget is a power loss model for a point-to-point link.
*** Rise time budget is analysis method used to measure the amount of dispersion which is present in a link.
* Line coding is the process of transforming data into digital signals for transmission over a point-to-point link. Can include binary data source, multiplexer and line coder.
** Non-return-to-zero (NRZ)
** Return-to-zero (RZ)
** Phase-encoded (PE)
** Block codes
* Error correction techniques are used to detect and correct errors that occur during transmission. 
** Automatic repeat request (ARQ)
** Forward error correction (FEC)
* Noise effects on system performance can be minimized by using signal conditioning techniques such as signal amplification and filtering.

These techniques are used to improve signal-to-noise ratio, which helps to maintain the integrity of the signal during transmission.

<text>Echion (), also known as Aetion (Ἀετίων), was a celebrated Greek painter spoken of by Lucian, who gives a description of one of his pictures, representing the marriage of Alexander the Great and Roxana. This painting excited such admiration when exhibited at the ancient Olympic Games, that Proxenidas, one of the judges, gave the artist his daughter in marriage. 

Echion seems to have excelled particularly in the art of mixing and laying on his colors. It has commonly been supposed that he lived in the time of Alexander the Great; but the words of Lucian show clearly that he must have lived about the time of Hadrian and the Antonines. Aloys Hirt supposes that the name of the painter of Alexander&#x27;s marriage, whom Lucian praises so highly, as Aetion, is a corruption of Echion.

Sandro Botticelli drew on Lucian&#x27;s ekphrasis in his &quot;Mars and Venus&quot; (, now National Gallery), borrowing the amoretti playing with Alexander&#x27;s armour during the ceremony, two carrying his lance and one who has crawled inside his breastplate.

<text>Grand Canyon National Park is a national park of the United States located in northwestern Arizona, the 15th site to have been named as a national park. The park&#x27;s central feature is the Grand Canyon, a gorge of the Colorado River, which is often considered one of the Wonders of the World. The park, which covers of unincorporated area in Coconino and Mohave counties, received more than 4.7 million recreational visitors in 2023. The Grand Canyon was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979. The park celebrated its 100th anniversary on February 26, 2019.

==History==

The Grand Canyon became well known to Americans in the 1880s after railroads were built and pioneers developed infrastructure and early tourism. In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt visited the site and said, The Grand Canyon fills me with awe. It is beyond comparison—beyond description; absolutely unparalleled throughout the wide world ... Let this great wonder of nature remain as it now is. Do nothing to mar its grandeur, sublimity and loveliness. You cannot improve on it. But you can keep it for your children, your children&#x27;s children, and all who come after you, as the one great sight which every American should see.

Despite Roosevelt&#x27;s enthusiasm and strong interest in preserving land for public use, the Grand Canyon was not immediately designated as a national park. The first bill to establish Grand Canyon National Park was introduced in 1882 by then-Senator Benjamin Harrison, which would have established Grand Canyon as the third national park in the United States, after Yellowstone and Mackinac. Harrison unsuccessfully reintroduced his bill in 1883 and 1886; after his election to the presidency, he established the Grand Canyon Forest Reserve in 1893. Theodore Roosevelt created the Grand Canyon Game Preserve by proclamation on November 28, 1906, and the Grand Canyon National Monument on January 11, 1908. Further Senate bills to establish the site as a national park were introduced and defeated in 1910 and 1911, before the Grand Canyon National Park Act () was finally signed by President Woodrow Wilson on February 26, 1919. The National Park Service, established in 1916, assumed administration of the park.

The creation of the park was an early success of the conservation movement. Its national park status may have helped thwart proposals to dam the Colorado River within its boundaries. (Later, the Glen Canyon Dam would be built upriver.) A second Grand Canyon National Monument to the west was proclaimed in 1932. In 1975, that monument and Marble Canyon National Monument, which was established in 1969 and followed the Colorado River northeast from the Grand Canyon to Lees Ferry, were made part of Grand Canyon National Park. In 1979, UNESCO declared the park a World Heritage Site. The 1987 the National Parks Overflights Act found that
&quot;Noise associated with aircraft overflights at the Grand Canyon National Park is causing a significant adverse effect on the natural quiet and experience of the park and current aircraft operations at the Grand Canyon National Park have raised serious concerns regarding public safety, including concerns regarding the safety of park users.&quot;

In 2010, Grand Canyon National Park was honored with its own coin under the America the Beautiful Quarters program. On February 26, 2019, the Grand Canyon National Park commemorated 100 years since its designation as a national park.

The Grand Canyon had been part of the National Park Service&#x27;s Intermountain Region until 2018. Today, the Grand Canyon is a part of Region 8, also known as the Lower Colorado Basin.

==Geography==

The Grand Canyon, including its extensive system of tributary canyons, is valued for its combination of size, depth, and exposed layers of colorful rocks dating back to Precambrian times. The canyon itself was created by the incision of the Colorado River and its tributaries after the Colorado Plateau was uplifted, causing the Colorado River system to develop along its present path.

The primary public areas of the park are the South and North Rims, and adjacent areas of the canyon itself. The rest of the park is extremely rugged and remote, although many places are accessible by pack trail and backcountry roads. The South Rim is more accessible than the North Rim and accounts for 90% of park visitation.

The park headquarters are at Grand Canyon Village, not far from the South Entrance to the park, near one of the most popular viewpoints.

===South Rim===

Most visitors to the park come to the South Rim, arriving on Arizona State Route 64. The highway enters the park through the South Entrance, near Tusayan, Arizona, and heads eastward, leaving the park through the East Entrance. Interstate 40 provides access to the area from the south. From the north, U.S. Route 89 connects Utah, Colorado, and the North Rim to the South Rim. Overall, some 30 miles of the South Rim are accessible by road.

====Services====
Grand Canyon Village is the primary visitor services area in the park. It is a full-service community, including lodging, fuel, food, souvenirs, a hospital, churches, and access to trails and guided walks and talks.

====Lodging====
Several lodging facilities are available along the South Rim. Hotels and other lodging include El Tovar, Bright Angel Lodge, Kachina Lodge, Thunderbird Lodge, and Maswik Lodge, all of which are located in Grand Canyon Village, and Phantom Ranch, located on the canyon floor. There is also an RV Park named Trailer Village. All of these facilities are managed by Xanterra Parks &amp; Resorts, while the Yavapai Lodge (also in the village area) is managed by Delaware North.

===North Rim===

The North Rim area of the park is located on the Kaibab Plateau and Walhalla Plateau, directly across the Grand Canyon from the principal visitor areas on the South Rim. The North Rim&#x27;s principal visitor areas are centered around Bright Angel Point. The North Rim is higher in elevation than the South Rim, at over of elevation. Because it is so much higher than the South Rim, it is closed from December 1 through May 15 each year, due to the enhanced snowfall at elevation. Visitor services are closed or limited in scope after October 15. Driving time from the South Rim to the North Rim is about 4.5 hours, over .
On the North Rim is the historic Grand Canyon Lodge, managed by Forever Resorts, and a campground near the lodge managed by the national park staff.

==Climate==

According to the Köppen climate classification system, Grand Canyon National Park has five climate zones; Cold Semi-Arid (&quot;BSk&quot;), Humid Continental Dry Cool Summer (&quot;Dsb&quot;), Humid Continental Dry Warm Summer (&quot;Dsa&quot;), Warm Summer Mediterranean (&quot;Csb&quot;), and Hot Summer Mediterranean (&quot;Csa&quot;). The plant hardiness zone at Grand Canyon Visitor Center is 7a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of 3.3 °F (−15.9 °C).

==Activities==
===North Rim===

There are few roads on the North Rim, but there are some notable vehicle-accessible lookout points, including Point Imperial, Roosevelt Point, and Cape Royal. Mule rides are also available to a variety of places, including several thousand feet down into the canyon.

Many visitors to the North Rim choose to make use of the variety of hiking trails including the Widforss Trail, Uncle Jim&#x27;s Trail, the Transept Trail, and the North Kaibab Trail. The North Kaibab Trail can be followed all the way down to the Colorado River, connecting across the river to the South Kaibab Trail and the Bright Angel Trail, which continue up to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon.

The Toroweap Overlook is located in the western part of the park on the North Rim. Access is via unpaved roads off Route 389 west of Fredonia, Arizona. The roads lead through Grand Canyon–Parashant National Monument and to the overlook.

===South Rim===

A variety of activities at the South Rim cater to park visitors. A driving tour () along the South Rim is split into two segments. The western drive to Hermit&#x27;s Point is with several overlooks along the way, including Mohave Point, Hopi Point, and the Powell Memorial. From March to December, access to Hermit&#x27;s Rest is restricted to the free shuttle provided by the Park Service. The eastern portion to Desert View is , and is open to private vehicles year round.

Walking tours include the Rim Trail, which runs west from the Pipe Creek viewpoint for about of paved road, followed by unpaved to Hermit&#x27;s Rest. Hikes can begin almost anywhere along this trail, and a shuttle can return hikers to their point of origin. Mather Point, the first view most people reach when entering from the south entrance, is a popular place to begin.

Private canyon flyovers are provided by helicopters and small airplanes out of Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Grand Canyon National Park Airport. Due to a crash in the 1990s, scenic flights are no longer allowed to fly within of the rim within the Grand Canyon National Park. Flights within the canyon are still available outside of park boundaries.

==Grand Canyon Conservancy==
The Grand Canyon Association (GCA) is the National Park Service&#x27;s official nonprofit partner. It raises private funds to benefit Grand Canyon National Park by operating retail shops and visitor centers within the park, and providing educational opportunities about the natural and cultural history of the region. Its goals include:

*Creating Inter-tribal cultural sites
* Dark Sky Preservation
* Discovery and exploration of the Park
* Trail creation and preservation

<doc id="46989" wikidata="Q118841" url="?curid=46989" title="Grand Canyon">
<text>The Grand Canyon is a steep-sided canyon carved by the Colorado River in Arizona, United States. The Grand Canyon is long, up to wide and attains a depth of over a mile ().

The canyon and adjacent rim are contained within Grand Canyon National Park, the Kaibab National Forest, Grand Canyon–Parashant National Monument, the Hualapai Indian Reservation, the Havasupai Indian Reservation and the Navajo Nation. The surrounding area is contained within the Baaj Nwaavjo I&#x27;tah Kukveni – Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon National Monument. President Theodore Roosevelt was a major proponent of the preservation of the Grand Canyon area and visited it on numerous occasions to hunt and enjoy the scenery.

Nearly two billion years of Earth&#x27;s geological history have been exposed as the Colorado River and its tributaries cut their channels through layer after layer of rock while the Colorado Plateau was uplifted. While some aspects about the history of incision of the canyon are debated by geologists, several recent studies support the hypothesis that the Colorado River established its course through the area about 5 to 6 million years ago. Since that time, the Colorado River has driven the down-cutting of the tributaries and retreat of the cliffs, simultaneously deepening and widening the canyon.

For thousands of years, the area has been continuously inhabited by Native Americans, who built settlements within the canyon and its many caves. The Pueblo people considered the Grand Canyon a holy site, and made pilgrimages to it. The first European known to have viewed the Grand Canyon was García López de Cárdenas from Spain, who arrived in 1540.

==Geography==


The Grand Canyon is a river valley in the Colorado Plateau that exposes uplifted Proterozoic and Paleozoic strata, and it is also one of the six distinct physiographic sections of the Colorado Plateau province. Even though it is not the deepest canyon on land in the world (Kali Gandaki Gorge in Nepal is much deeper), the Grand Canyon is known for its visually overwhelming size and its intricate and colorful landscape. Geologically, it is significant because of the thick sequence of ancient rocks that are well preserved and exposed in the walls of the canyon. These rock layers record much of the early geologic history of the North American continent.

Uplift associated with mountain formation later moved these sediments thousands of feet upward and created the Colorado Plateau. The higher elevation has also resulted in greater precipitation in the Colorado River drainage area, but not enough to change the Grand Canyon area from being semi-arid. The uplift of the Colorado Plateau is uneven, and the Kaibab Plateau that the Grand Canyon bisects is over higher at the North Rim than at the South Rim. Almost all runoff from the North Rim (which also gets more rain and snow) flows toward the Grand Canyon, while much of the runoff on the plateau behind the South Rim flows away from the canyon (following the general tilt). The result is deeper and longer tributary washes and canyons on the north side and shorter and steeper side canyons on the south side.

Temperatures on the North Rim are generally lower than those on the South Rim because of the greater elevation (averaging above sea level). Heavy rains are common on both rims during the summer months. Access to the North Rim via the primary route leading to the canyon (State Route 67) is limited during the winter season due to road closures.

==Geology==


The Grand Canyon is part of the Colorado River basin, which has developed over the past 70million years. For more than 150 years, scientists have gathered data, proposed new ideas, and debated sometimes contentious theories about the geologic origins of the Grand Canyon and the Colorado River. Formation of the Grand Canyon and the Colorado River may involve a complex history in which multiple factors and geologic processes have interacted over time and in different locations.

In the most recent round of &quot;old river&quot; vs. &quot;young river&quot; controversy, researchers have challenged estimates that had placed the age of the canyon at 5–6million years. The research has aroused considerable controversy because it suggests a substantial departure from prior widely supported scientific consensus.

In a 2008 study, Victor Polyak examined caves near the Grand Canyon and placed their origins about 17million years ago. The study, which was published in the journal &quot;Science&quot; in 2008, used uranium-lead dating to analyze calcite deposits found on the walls of nine caves throughout the canyon.

In another 2008 study, Rebecca Flowers reported on apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronometry results suggesting that parts of the Grand Canyon had reached a depth near to the modern depth around 20million years ago.
In a subsequent study published in the journal &quot;Science&quot; in 2012, she suggested that the western part of the Grand Canyon could be as old as 70million years.

The emerging scientific consensus is that the canyon is made up of multiple segments which formed at different times and eventually connected to become the waterway now traversed by the Colorado River. Of the three central segments, the &quot;Hurricane&quot; was formed 50–70million years ago, and the &quot;Eastern Grand Canyon&quot; was cut 15–25million years ago. In contrast, the &quot;Marble Canyon&quot; and &quot;Westernmost Grand Canyon&quot; segments at the ends of the canyon were carved in the last five to six million years.

The major geologic exposures in the Grand Canyon range in age from the two-billion-year-old Vishnu Schist at the bottom of the Inner Gorge to the 270-million-year-old Kaibab Limestone on the Rim. Within that there is a gap, the Great Unconformity, between 1.75billion and 1.25billion years ago for which no deposits are present.

Then, between 1.25billion and 730million years ago, intermittent sediments began to form the Grand Canyon Supergroup. Many of the formations were deposited in warm shallow seas, near-shore environments (such as beaches), and swamps as the seashore repeatedly advanced and retreated over the edge of a proto-North America. Major exceptions include the Permian Coconino Sandstone, which contains abundant geological evidence of aeolian sand dune deposition. Several parts of the Supai Group also were deposited in non-marine environments.

The great depth of the Grand Canyon and especially the height of its strata (most of which formed below sea level) can be attributed to of uplift of the Colorado Plateau, starting about 65million years ago (during the Laramide orogeny). This uplift has steepened the stream gradient of the Colorado River and its tributaries, which in turn has increased their speed and thus their ability to cut through rock (see the elevation summary of the Colorado River for present conditions).

Weather conditions during the ice ages also increased the amount of water in the Colorado River drainage system. The ancestral Colorado River responded by cutting its channel faster and deeper.

The base level and course of the Colorado River (or its ancestral equivalent) changed 5.3million years ago when the Gulf of California opened and lowered the river&#x27;s base level (its lowest point). This increased the rate of erosion and cut nearly all of the Grand Canyon&#x27;s current depth by 1.2million years ago. The terraced walls of the canyon were created by differential erosion.

Between 100,000 and 3million years ago, volcanic activity deposited ash and lava over the area, which at times completely obstructed the river. These volcanic rocks are the youngest in the canyon.

==Hydrology==

Groundwater flow in the Grand Canyon region is an active area of study.
Groundwater forms when rain soaks down into the earth and reaches the water table. The composition of the earth in a given area determines its permeability, the ease with which water flows through it. Sand is more permeable than clay. Less permeable rock layers composed of clay can block the passage of water and are known as aquitards. More permeable areas of rock that hold and transport groundwater underground are known as aquifers. An area of water bounded by two aquitards is called a confined aquifer, while water below the surface and above an aquitard is called an unconfined aquifer.

The different geologic levels of the Grand Canyon have created two major aquifers where groundwater collects. The higher C-aquifer is an unconfined aquifer. It collects groundwater that seeps through the Kaibab and Toroweap Formations into the Coconino Sandstone. Below it, the Permian Hermit Formation and Supai Group provide a dense barrier. Groundwater from the C-acquifer can flow laterally, appearing as seeps along the canyon walls at the base of the Coconino Sandstone but can also descend vertically through fault zones to recharge the underlying confined R-aquifer. The R-aquifer, also known as the Red Wall Muav aquifer, is a karst aquifer. It involves an area of substantial fracturing through the Redwall Limestone, Temple Butte Formation and Cambrian Muav Limestone of the Tonto Group. Five individual systems flow through the R-aquifer and compose the regional groundwater-flow system which drains into the Grand Canyon: Kaibab, Uinkaret-Kanab, Marble-Shinumo, Cataract, and Blue Spring.

The flow of groundwater in the Grand Canyon region is influenced in multiple ways by geologic faults and folds. Discharge from the R-aquifer appears as springs and seeps in both the Grand Canyon and tributary canyons. Springs discharge to the Grand Canyon in areas of lower Paleozoic carbonates, and are associated with geologic faults and fractures. Fractures are believed to provide dominant pathways both for vertical circulation in the Paleozoic section, and for lateral collection and transport of water to springs deep in the canyons. The largest springs discharge from the R-aquifer. A smaller number of springs discharge at lower rates from the C-aquifer. Much of the water that could potentially recharge the aquifers is likely released as springs rather than reaching the aquifers.

Studies of the chemical composition of groundwater at sites across the Grand Canyon region indicate that groundwater contains a fraction of modern water (post-1950), and that many springs have a mix of modern water and older groundwater. Estimated mean ages for South Rim groundwater range from 6 years old (San Francisco Peaks) to nearly 20,000 years old (Bar Four well, Blue Spring). Groundwater age in the South Rim groundwater system also correlates to longitude, with age increasing from east to west from Red Canyon to Boucher springs. Surprisingly, the Canyon Mine Observation well is more similar to Redwall-Muav aquifer wells (R-aquifer) than to the Coconino C-aquifer. This suggests the possibility of a hydrologic connection or similar recharge sources for that hydrologic position. Old groundwater from Havasupai well may have a similar source to the Havasu Spring upwelling from the Redwall-Muav aquifer. Sites with younger estimated mean ages tend to be associated with the unconfined Coconino aquifer. They may recharge quickly as a result of snowmelt, run-off and local precipitation. It is likely that the deeper confined R-aquifer relies primarily on snowmelt from the San Francisco Peaks to recharge.

Other research has tried to relate groundwater flow paths to possible levels of risk for contamination and identify vulnerability regions for the underlying aquifers. Almost half of the Kaibab plateau&#x27;s surface was associated with high to very high vulnerability of the unconfined Coconino aquifer (C-aquifer), while about a fifth of the Kaibab Plateau was estimated to be an area of high vulnerability for the Redwall-Muav aquifer (R-aquifer).

==History==

===Native Americans===
The Ancestral Puebloans were a Native American culture centered on the present-day Four Corners area of the United States. They were the first people known to live in the Grand Canyon area. The cultural group has often been referred to in archaeology as the Anasazi, although the term is not preferred by the modern Puebloan peoples. The word &quot;Anasazi&quot; is Navajo for &quot;enemy ancestors&quot; or &quot;alien ancestors&quot;.

Archaeologists still debate when this distinct culture emerged. The current consensus, based on terminology defined by the Pecos Classification, suggests their emergence was around 1200  during the Basketmaker II Era. Beginning with the earliest explorations and excavations, researchers have believed that the Ancestral Puebloans are ancestors of the modern Pueblo peoples.

In addition to the Ancestral Puebloans, a number of distinct cultures have inhabited the Grand Canyon area. The Cohonina lived to the west of the Grand Canyon, between 500 and 1200 . The Cohonina were ancestors of the Yuman, Havasupai, and Hualapai peoples who inhabit the area today.

The Sinagua were a cultural group occupying an area to the southeast of the Grand Canyon, between the Little Colorado River and the Salt River, between approximately 500 and 1425 . The Sinagua may have been ancestors of several Hopi clans.

By the time of the arrival of Europeans in the 16thcentury, newer cultures had evolved. The Hualapai inhabit a stretch along the pine-clad southern side of the Grand Canyon. The Havasupai have been living in the area near Cataract Canyon since the beginning of the 13thcentury, occupying an area the size of Delaware. The Southern Paiutes live in what is now southern Utah and northern Arizona. The Navajo, or Diné, live in a wide area stretching from the San Francisco Peaks eastwards towards the Four Corners. Archaeological and linguistic evidence suggests the Navajo descended from the Athabaskan people near Great Slave Lake, Canada, who migrated after the 11thcentury. In the mythology of some Third Mesa Hopi communities, the Grand Canyon was the location humankind arose out of the Third World from a sipapu.

===European arrival and settlement===

====Spanish explorers====
In September 1540, under orders from the conquistador Francisco Vázquez de Coronado to search for the fabled Seven Cities of Cibola, Captain García López de Cárdenas, along with Hopi guides and a small group of Spanish soldiers, traveled to the south rim of the Grand Canyon between Desert View and Moran Point. Pablo de Melgrossa, Juan Galeras, and a third soldier descended some one third of the way into the canyon until they were forced to return because of lack of water. In their report, they noted that some of the rocks in the canyon were &quot;bigger than the great tower of Seville, Giralda&quot;. It is speculated that their Hopi guides likely knew routes to the canyon floor, but may have been reluctant to lead the Spanish to the river. No Europeans visited the canyon again for more than two hundred years.

Fathers Francisco Atanasio Domínguez and Silvestre Vélez de Escalante were two Spanish priests who, with a group of Spanish soldiers, explored southern Utah and traveled along the north rim of the canyon in Glen and Marble Canyons in search of a route from Santa Fe to California in 1776. They eventually found a crossing, formerly known as the &quot;Crossing of the Fathers&quot;, that today lies under Lake Powell.

Also in 1776, Fray Francisco Garces, a Franciscan missionary, spent a week near Havasupai unsuccessfully attempting to convert a band of Native Americans to Christianity. He described the canyon as &quot;profound&quot;.

====American exploration====
James Ohio Pattie, along with a group of American trappers and mountain men, may have been the next European to reach the canyon, in 1826.

Jacob Hamblin, a Mormon missionary, was sent by Brigham Young in the 1850s to locate suitable river crossing sites in the canyon. Building good relations with local Hualapai and white settlers, he reached the Crossing of the Fathers, crossed the location that would become Lees Ferry on a raft in 1858 and Pearce Ferry (later operated by, and named for, Harrison Pearce). He also acted as an advisor to John Wesley Powell, before his second expedition to the Grand Canyon, serving as a diplomat between Powell and the local native tribes to ensure the safety of his party.
In 1857, Edward Fitzgerald Beale was superintendent of an expedition to survey a wagon road along the 35th parallel from Fort Defiance, Arizona to the Colorado River. He led a small party of men in search of water on the Coconino Plateau near the canyon&#x27;s south rim. On September 19, near present-day National Canyon, they came upon what May Humphreys Stacey described in his journal as &quot;a wonderful canyon; four thousand feet deep. Everybody in the party admitted that he never before saw anything to match or equal this astonishing natural curiosity.&quot;

Also in 1857, the U.S. War Department asked Lieutenant Joseph Ives to lead an expedition to assess the feasibility of an up-river navigation from the Gulf of California. On December 31, 1857, Ives embarked from the mouth of the Colorado in the stern wheeler steamboat &quot;Explorer&quot;. His party reached the lower end of Black Canyon on March 8, 1858, then continued on by rowboat past the mouth of the Virgin River after the &quot;Explorer&quot; struck a rock. Ives led his party east into the canyon – they may have been the first Europeans to travel the Diamond Creek drainage. In his &quot;Report Upon the Colorado River of the West&quot; to the Senate in 1861 Ives states that &quot;The marvellous story of Cardinas, that had formed for so long a time the only record concerning this rather mythical locality, was rather magnified than detracted from by the accounts of one or two trappers, who professed to have seen the cañon&quot;.
According to the &quot;San Francisco Herald&quot;, in a series of articles run in 1853, Captain Joseph R. Walker in January 1851 with his nephew James T. Walker and six men, traveled up the Colorado River to a point where it joined the Virgin River and continued east into Arizona, traveling along the Grand Canyon and making short exploratory side trips along the way. Walker is reported to have said he wanted to visit the &quot;Moqui&quot; (Hopi) Indians. who he had met briefly before and found exceptionally interesting.

In 1858, John Strong Newberry became probably the first geologist to visit the Grand Canyon.

In 1869, Major John Wesley Powell set out to explore the Colorado River and the Grand Canyon in the first expedition down the canyon. Powell ordered a shipwright to build four reinforced Whitewall rowboats from Chicago and had them shipped west on the newly completed Continental railroad. He hired nine men, including his brother Walter, and collected provisions for ten months. They set out from Green River, Wyoming, on May 24. On June 7, they lost one of their boats, 1/3 of their food, and other badly-needed supplies: as a result the team eventually had to subsist on starvation rations. Passing through (or portaging around) a series of dangerous rapids, the group passed down the Green River, reaching its confluence with the Colorado River, near present-day Moab, Utah, on July 17. Continuing on down the Colorado River, the party encountered more rapids and falls.

On August 28, 1869, faced with what some felt to be impassable rapids, three men left the expedition on foot in an attempt to reach a settlement away. Ironically, the remaining members went safely through the rapids on August 29, 1869, while Seneca Howland, Oramel Howland, and William H. Dunn were murdered. The area through which the three men traveled was marked by tensions between farming and hunting Shivwits and incoming Mormon settlers. Which group was responsible for killing the three men has been hotly debated. Powell himself visited the area the following year, and was told (through a Mormon interpreter) that the Shivwits had mistakenly killed the men, believing them to be prospectors who had murdered an Indian woman. He chose to smoke a peace pipe with them.
Powell went on to become the first Director of the U.S. Bureau of Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution (1879–1902) and the second Director of the US Geological Survey (1881–1894). He was the first to use the term &quot;Grand Canyon&quot;, in 1871; previously it had been called the &quot;Big Canyon&quot;.

In 1889, Frank M. Brown wanted to build a railroad along the Colorado River to carry coal. He, his chief engineer Robert Brewster Stanton, and 14 others started to explore the Grand Canyon in poorly designed cedar wood boats, with no life preservers. Brown drowned in an accident near Marble Canyon: Stanton made new boats and proceeded to explore the Colorado all of the way to the Gulf of California.

The Grand Canyon became an official national monument in 1908 and a national park in 1919.

====Federal protection: National Monument and Park====
U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt visited the Grand Canyon in 1903. An avid outdoorsman and staunch conservationist, Roosevelt established the Grand Canyon Game Preserve on November 28, 1906. Livestock grazing was reduced, but predators such as mountain lions, eagles, and wolves were eradicated. Roosevelt along with other members of his conservation group, the Boone and Crockett Club helped form the National Parks Association, which in turn lobbied for the Antiquities Act of 1906 which gave Roosevelt the power to create national monuments. Once the act was passed, Roosevelt immediately added adjacent national forest lands and redesignated the preserve a U.S. National Monument on January 11, 1908. Opponents such as land and mining claim holders blocked efforts to reclassify the monument as a U.S. National Park for 11 years. Grand Canyon National Park was finally established as the 17th U.S. National Park by an Act of Congress signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson on February 26, 1919.

The federal government administrators who manage park resources face many challenges. These include issues related to the recent reintroduction into the wild of the highly endangered California condor, air tour overflight noise levels, water rights and management disputes, and forest fire management.

The canyon&#x27;s ecosystem was permanently changed after the construction of the Glen Canyon Dam in 1963. Average flood levels dropped from 85,000 to 8,000 cubic ft/sec. In the absence of natural flooding, sandbars and beaches eroded and invasive species began to displace native species. Federal officials started releasing floods in the Grand Canyon in hopes of restoring its ecosystem beginning with 1996, 2004, and 2008.
In 2018, the Department of Interior started experimenting with “adaptive management” of the Glen Canyon Dam, using a High-Flow Experiment (HFE) water release to shift volumes of sand and monitoring effects such as the dispersal of invasive tamarisk seeds.
However, as of 2022, extreme drought has caused water levels in Lake Powell to drop so much that a planned release of water has been delayed, to ensure that the Glen Canyon Dam can continue to generate hydropower.

Between 2003 and 2011, 2,215 mining claims had been requested that are adjacent to the canyon, including claims for uranium mines. Critics of uranium mining are concerned that uranium will leach into the aquifers feeding the Colorado River and contaminate the water supply for up to 18 million people. In 2009, U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar published a Notice of Intent to suspend approvals for new uranium mining in the area. In 2012, Salazar established a 20-year moratorium (known as the &quot;Northern Arizona Withdrawal&quot;) withdrawing from the permitting process for uranium and hardrock mining, stating &quot;People from all over the country and around the world come to visit the Grand Canyon. Numerous American Indian tribes regard this magnificent icon as a sacred place and millions of people in the Colorado River Basin depend on the river for drinking water, irrigation, industrial and environmental use.&quot; However, Salazar&#x27;s 20-year moratorium on new mines still allows mines with previous authorization to operate. 

Multiple challenges have been brought into court both against the moratorium and against the operation of uranium mines in the area. The federal government&#x27;s 2012 moratorium was upheld by the U.S. District Court for Arizona in 2014, but appealed in November 2014 as &quot;National Mining Association v. Jewell&quot; (No. 14-17350). The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals again upheld the moratorium in 2017, stating that the Secretary of the Interior held valid withdrawal authority.

&quot;Havasupai Tribe v. Provencio&quot; was also argued at multiple court levels based on multiple grounds. The Havasupai people and the Grand Canyon Trust sought to block the reopening of the Pinyon Plain Mine (formerly Canyon Uranium Mine). Activity at the mine had ceased in 1992, ten years prior to the moratorium on new development in 2012. Appellants challenged the U.S. Forest Service&#x27;s consultation process for approving reopening of the mine. As of February 22, 2022, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the arguments in No. 20-16401, concluding that the Forest Service had not acted arbitrarily in making its decision.

A study examining samples of groundwater from 180 spring sites and 26 wells in the Grand Canyon region has assessed the presence of uranium in groundwater from September 1, 1981, to October 7, 2020. The goal of the study was to establish a baseline assessment of groundwater conditions in the Grand Canyon region. At 95% of sites, maximum observed uranium concentrations were below the EPAs Maximum Contaminant Level for drinking water, 30 μg/L. At 86% of sites, uranium concentrations were below the Canadian level for protection of freshwater aquatic life, 15 μg/L.

On August 8, 2023, it was announced that U.S. President Joe Biden will designate Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni – Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon National Monument, a move aimed at conserving nearly 1 million acres of greater Grand Canyon landscape.

==South Rim buildings==
There are several historic buildings located along the South Rim with most in the vicinity of Grand Canyon Village.

* Buckey O&#x27;Neill Cabin was built during the 1890s by William Owen &quot;Buckey&quot; O&#x27;Neill. He built the cabin because of a copper deposit that was nearby. He had several occupations such as miner, judge, politician, author and tour guide. This cabin is the longest continually standing structure on the South Rim. It is currently used as a guest house; booking is required well in advance.
* Kolb Studio was built in 1904 by brothers Ellsworth and Emery Kolb. They were photographers who made a living by photographing visitors walking down the Bright Angel Trail. In 1911, the Kolb brothers filmed their journey down the Green and Colorado Rivers. Emery Kolb showed this movie regularly in his studio until 1976 when he died at the age of 95. Today the building serves as an art gallery and exhibit.
* The El Tovar Hotel was built in 1905 as a luxury hotel for the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway, on the South Rim near the railway&#x27;s main line. It was designed by Charles Whittlesley, a staff architect for the railway. The hotel is reminiscent of a Swiss chalet or Norwegian villa, combined with local materials for a rustic appearance sometimes called &quot;National Park Service rustic.&quot; It consists of 4 stories, with a gift shop and restaurant located inside the hotel.
* Hopi House was built by Mary Jane Colter in 1905. It is based on structures that were built in an ancient Hopi settlement called Old Oraibi, located on the Third Mesa in eastern Arizona. It served as a residence for the Hopi Indians who sold arts and crafts to South Rim visitors.
* Verkamp&#x27;s Curios, which stands next to the Hopi House, was built by John Verkamp in 1905. He sold arts and crafts as well as souvenirs. Until September 2008, it was run by his descendants; in November 2008, the building reopened as a visitor center focusing on the history of the Grand Canyon Village community.
* Grand Canyon Railway Depot was completed in 1910 and contains 2 levels. Gordon Chappell, Regional Historian for the Park Service, claims that this depot building is one of only three log-cabin-style train stations currently standing, out of fourteen ever built in the U.S. The depot is the northern terminus of the Grand Canyon Railway which begins in Williams, Arizona.
* Lookout Studio, another Mary Colter design, was built in 1914. Photography, artwork, books, souvenirs, and rock and fossil specimens are sold here. A great view of Bright Angel Trail can be seen here.
* Desert View Watchtower, one of Mary Colter&#x27;s best-known works, was built in 1932. Situated at the far eastern end of the South Rim, from Grand Canyon Village, the tower stands tall. The top of the tower is above sea level, the highest point on the South Rim. It offers one of the few full views of the bottom of the canyon and the Colorado River. It was designed to mimic Ancestral Puebloans watchtowers, though, with four levels, it is significantly taller than historical towers.
* Bright Angel Lodge was built of logs and stone in 1935. Mary Colter designed the lodge and it was built by the Fred Harvey Company. Inside the lodge is a small museum honoring Fred Harvey (1835–1901), who played a major role in popularizing the Grand Canyon. In the History Room is a stone fireplace layered in the same sequence as those in the canyon.

==Weather==
Weather in the Grand Canyon varies according to elevation. The forested rims are high enough to receive winter snowfall, but along the Colorado River in the Inner Gorge, temperatures are similar to those found in Tucson and other low elevation desert locations in Arizona. Conditions in the Grand Canyon region are generally dry, but substantial precipitation occurs twice annually, during seasonal pattern shifts in winter (when Pacific storms usually deliver widespread, moderate rain and high-elevation snow to the region from the west) and in late summer (due to the North American Monsoon, which delivers waves of moisture from the southeast, causing dramatic, localized thunderstorms fueled by the heat of the day). Average annual precipitation on the South Rim is less than , with of snow; the higher North Rim usually receives of moisture, with a typical snowfall of ; and Phantom Ranch, far below the canyon&#x27;s rims along the Colorado River at gets just of rain, and snow is a rarity.

Temperatures vary wildly throughout the year, with summer highs within the Inner Gorge commonly exceeding and winter minimum temperatures sometimes falling below along the canyon&#x27;s rims. Visitors are often surprised by these potentially extreme conditions, and this, along with the high altitude of the canyon&#x27;s rims, can lead to unpleasant side effects such as dehydration, sunburn, and hypothermia.

Weather conditions can greatly affect hiking and canyon exploration, and visitors should obtain accurate forecasts because of hazards posed by exposure to extreme temperatures, winter storms and late summer monsoons. While the park service posts weather information at gates and visitor centers, this is a rough approximation only, and should not be relied upon for trip planning. For accurate weather in the canyon, hikers should consult the National Weather Service&#x27;s NOAA weather radio or the official National Weather Service website.

The National Weather Service has had a cooperative station on the South Rim since 1903. The record high temperature on the South Rim was on June 26, 1974, and the record low temperature was on January 1, 1919, February 1, 1985, and December 23, 1990.

===Air quality===

 the Grand Canyon area had some of the cleanest air in the United States.
However, air quality in the area can be affected by air pollution from coal-fired power plants, mining, oil and gas, vehicles, and urban and industrial pollution from nearby states, California and Mexico. Events such as forest fires and dust storms in the Southwest can have a considerable impact.

Differences in visibility tend to be seasonal: best during the winter and poorest during the summer.
Winter cold fronts tend to carry clean, crisp air from the northwest, a less populated area. However they can also carry pollution from nearby mines and power plants. The average visibility during the winter is 160 miles, with the potential to reach 210 miles under ideal conditions. In the summer, prevailing winds from the southwest carry pollution from major urban and industrial centers, and visibility on average is only 100 miles. Within the canyon itself, smog can be trapped.

Air quality and visibility in the canyon are affected mainly by sulfates, soils, and organics. The sulfates largely result from urban emissions in southern California, borne on the prevailing westerly winds throughout much of the year, and emissions from Arizona&#x27;s copper smelter region, borne on southerly or southeasterly winds during the monsoon. Airborne soils originate with windy conditions and road dust. Organic particles result from vehicle emissions, long-range transport from urban areas, and forest fires, as well as from VOCs emitted by vegetation in the surrounding forests. Nitrates, carried in from urban areas, stationary sources, and vehicle emissions; as well as black carbon from forest fires and vehicle emissions, also contribute to a lesser extent.

A number of actions have been taken to preserve and further improve air quality and visibility at the canyon.
In 1990, amendments to the Clean Air Act established the Grand Canyon Visibility Transport Commission (GCVTC) to advise the US EPA on strategies for protecting visual air quality on the Colorado Plateau. The GCVTC released its final report in 1996 and initiated the Western Regional Air Partnership (WRAP), a partnership of state, tribal and federal agencies to help coordinate the implementation of the commission&#x27;s recommendations.

In 1999, the Regional Haze Rule established a goal of restoring visibility in national parks and wilderness areas (Class 1 areas), such as the Grand Canyon, to natural background levels by 2064. Subsequent revisions to the rule provide specific requirements for making reasonable progress toward that goal.

In the early 1990s, studies indicated that emissions of SO2, a sulfate precursor, from the Navajo Generating Station affected visibility in the canyon, mainly in the winter.
As a result, scrubbers were added to the plant&#x27;s three units in 1997 through 1999 to reduce SO2 emissions by 90% on an annual average. Before and after observations showed a wintertime decrease of 33% for particulate sulfur (Sp), improving visibility. The plant also installed low-NOx SOFA burners in 2009–2011, reducing emissions of NOx, a nitrate precursor, by 40%
The plant shut down completely in 2019.
Emissions from the Mohave Generating Station to the west were similarly found to affect visibility in the canyon. The plant was required to have installed SO2 scrubbers, but was instead shut down in 2005, completely eliminating its emissions.

Prescribed fires are typically conducted in the spring and fall in the forests adjacent to the canyon to reduce the potential for severe forest fires and resulting smoke conditions. Although prescribed fires also affect air quality, the controlled conditions allow the use of management techniques to minimize their impact.
==Climate change==
Due to the increase of greenhouse gases, temperatures have steadily risen making recent years the warmest in the century-long record. Temperatures have increased in Arizona by 2.1 degrees Fahrenheit since 1895. From 1916 to 2014, naturalized streamflow in the Upper Colorado River Basin decreased by 16.5%, in spite of a slight increase of +1.4% in annual precipitation over the same period.
Increases in temperature correlate to increased evaporation, loss of reflective snow, and decreases in snowpack, reducing available water in the Colorado River by an estimated 9.3% per degree Celsius of warming.

Over the last 30 years, the South Rim of the Grand Canyon has averaged 13.4 inches of rainfall per year, while the North Rim has averaged 24 inches. The first dual distribution water system in the United States was built on the South Rim, treating and reclaiming wastewater for nonpotable reuse as early as 1926. Early on, water for human use was brought in by tankers, and pumped up from a spring deeper in the canyon. In the 1960s, the Transcanyon Pipeline was built to carry water from the North Rim down into the canyon and back up to the South Rim.
Every day 500,000 gallons of water are pumped from underground springs on the North Rim through the pipeline to supply the more heavily developed South Rim with water.

As water consumption continues to soar due to increasing visitation in the park, both the sustainability of the water supply and the condition of the pipeline are in question. As of 2019, plans to replace the aging 16-mile aluminum pipeline were proposed. Another proposal, from the Bureau of Reclamation, recommended that the park drill a well into the Redwall-Muav aquifer to meet the increasing water consumption. However, the aquifer&#x27;s recharge rate stands to decline over time due to decreases in precipitation and snowpack. Some effects of over pumping aquifers include land subsidence, reduction in rivers and lakes, disrupted riparian systems, and poor water quality.

In the National Park Service&#x27;s &quot;Climate Action Plan,&quot; goals were set to reduce greenhouse gases 30 percent below 2008 levels by 2020 and plan and implement measures that best allow the park to adapt to the impacts of climate change. Strategies to accomplish these goals included: &quot;reduce [greenhouse gases] emissions resulting from activities within and by the park, developing and implementing a plan to adapt to current and future impacts of climate change, increase climate change education and outreach, and monitor progress and identify areas for improvement&quot;.

==Biology and ecology==

===Plants===
There are approximately 1,737 known species of vascular plants, 167 species of fungi, 64 species of moss, and 195 species of lichen found in Grand Canyon National Park. This variety is largely due to the elevation change from the Colorado River up to the highest point on the North Rim. Grand Canyon boasts a dozen endemic plants (known only within the Park&#x27;s boundaries) while only ten percent of the Park&#x27;s flora is exotic. Sixty-three plants found here have been given special status by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

The Mojave Desert influences the western sections of the canyon, Sonoran Desert vegetation covers the eastern sections, and ponderosa and pinyon pine forests grow on both rims.

Natural seeps and springs percolating out of the canyon walls are home to 11% of all the plant species found in the Grand Canyon. The canyon itself can act as a connection between the east and the west by providing corridors of appropriate habitat along its length. The canyon can also be a genetic barrier to some species, like the tassel-eared squirrel.

The aspect, or direction a slope faces, also plays a major role in adding diversity to the Grand Canyon. North-facing slopes receive about one-third the normal amount of sunlight, so plants growing there are similar to plants found at higher elevations, or in more northern latitudes. The south-facing slopes receive the full amount of sunlight and are covered in vegetation typical of the Sonoran Desert.

===Animals===

Of the 90 mammal species found along the Colorado River corridor, 18 are rodents and 22 are bats.

===Life zones and communities===
The Park contains several major ecosystems. Its great biological diversity can be attributed to the presence of five of the seven life zones and three of the four desert types in North America. The five life zones represented are the Lower Sonoran, Upper Sonoran, Transition, Canadian, and Hudsonian. This is equivalent to traveling from Mexico to Canada. Differences in elevation and the resulting variations in climate are the major factors that form the various life zones and communities in and around the canyon. Grand Canyon National Park contains 129 vegetation communities, and the composition and distribution of plant species are influenced by climate, geomorphology and geology.

====Lower Sonoran====
The Lower Sonoran life zone spans from the Colorado River up to . Along the Colorado River and its perennial tributaries, a riparian community exists. Coyote willow, arrowweed, seep-willow, western honey mesquite, catclaw acacia, and exotic tamarisk (saltcedar) are the predominant species. Hanging gardens, seeps and springs often contain rare plants such as the white-flowering western redbud, stream orchid, and &quot;Flaveria mcdougallii&quot;. Endangered fish in the river include the humpback chub and the razorback sucker.

The three most common amphibians in these riparian communities are the canyon tree frog, red-spotted toad, and Woodhouse&#x27;s Rocky Mountain toad. Leopard frogs are very rare in the Colorado River corridor; they have undergone major declines and have not been seen in the Canyon in several years. There are 33 crustacean species found in the Colorado River and its tributaries within Grand Canyon National Park. Of these 33, 16 are considered true zooplankton organisms.

Only 48 bird species regularly nest along the river, while others use the river as a migration corridor or as an overwintering habitat. The bald eagle is one species that uses the river corridor as a winter habitat.

River otters may have disappeared from the park in the late 20th century, and muskrats are extremely rare. Beavers cut willows, cottonwoods, and shrubs for food, and can significantly affect the riparian vegetation. Other rodents, such as antelope squirrels and pocket mice, are mostly omnivorous, using many different vegetation types. Grand Canyon bats typically roost in desert uplands but forage on the abundance of insects along the river and its tributaries. In addition to bats, coyotes, ringtails, and spotted skunks are the most numerous riparian predators and prey on invertebrates, rodents, and reptiles.

Raccoons, weasels, bobcats, gray foxes, and mountain lions are also present but are much rarer. Ungulate species such as mule deer and desert bighorn sheep frequent the river corridor. Since the removal of 500 feral burros in the early 1980s, bighorn sheep numbers have rebounded. Mule deer are generally not permanent residents along the river but travel down from the rim when food and water resources there become scarce.

The insect species commonly found in the river corridor and tributaries are midges, caddisflies, mayflies, stoneflies, black flies, mites, beetles, butterflies, moths, and fire ants. Numerous species of spiders and several species of scorpions, including the bark scorpion and the giant desert hairy scorpion, inhabit the riparian zone.

Eleven aquatic and 26 terrestrial species of mollusks have been identified in and around Grand Canyon National Park. Of the aquatic species, two are bivalves (clams) and nine are gastropods (snails). Twenty-six species of terrestrial gastropods have been identified, primarily land snails and slugs.

There are approximately 41 reptile species in Grand Canyon National Park. Ten are considered common along the river corridor and include lizards and snakes. Lizard density tends to be highest along the stretch of land between the water&#x27;s edge and the beginning of the upland desert community. The two largest lizards in the canyon are gila monsters and chuckwallas. Many snake species, which are not directly dependent on surface water, may be found both within the inner gorge and the Colorado River corridor. Six rattlesnake species have been recorded in the park.

Above the river corridor a desert scrub community, composed of North American desert flora, thrives. Typical warm desert species such as creosote bush, white bursage, brittlebush, catclaw acacia, ocotillo, mariola, western honey mesquite, four-winged saltbush, big sagebrush, blackbrush, and rubber rabbitbrush grow in this community. The mammalian fauna in the woodland scrub community consists of 50 species, mostly rodents and bats. Three of the five Park woodrat species live in the desert scrub community.

Except for the western banded gecko, which seems to be distributed only near water along the Colorado River, all of the reptiles found near the river also appear in the uplands, but in lower densities. The desert gopher tortoise, a threatened species, inhabits the desert scrublands in the western end of the park.

Some of the common insects found at elevations above are orange paper wasps, honey bees, black flies, tarantula hawks, stink bugs, beetles, black ants, and monarch and swallowtail butterflies. Solifugids, wood spiders, garden spiders, black widow spiders, and tarantulas can be found in the desert scrub and higher elevations.

====Upper Sonoran and Transition====

The Upper Sonoran Life Zone includes most of the inner canyon and South Rim at elevations from . This zone is generally dominated by blackbrush, sagebrush, and pinyon-juniper woodlands. Elevations of are in the Mojave Desert Scrub community of the Upper Sonoran. This community is dominated by the four-winged saltbush and creosote bush; other important plants include Utah agave, narrowleaf mesquite, ratany, catclaw acacia, and various cacti species.

Approximately 30 bird species breed primarily in the desert uplands and cliffs of the inner canyon. Virtually all bird species present breed in other suitable habitats throughout the Sonoran and Mohave deserts. The abundance of bats, swifts, and riparian birds provides ample food for peregrines, and suitable eyrie sites are plentiful along the steep canyon walls. Also, several critically endangered California condors have made the eastern part of the Park their home, having been re-introduced to the Colorado Plateau on the Arizona Strip earlier.
The conifer forests provide habitat for 52 mammal species. Porcupines, shrews, red squirrels, tassel-eared Kaibab and Abert&#x27;s squirrels, black bear, mule deer, and elk are found at the park&#x27;s higher elevations on the Kaibab Plateau.

Above the desert scrub and up to is a pinyon pine forest and one seed juniper woodland. Within this woodland one can find big sagebrush, snakeweed, Mormon tea, Utah agave, banana and narrowleaf Yucca, winterfat, Indian ricegrass, dropseed, and needlegrass. There are a variety of snakes and lizards here, but one species of reptile, the mountain short-horned lizard, is a particularly abundant inhabitant of the piñon-juniper and ponderosa pine forests.

Ponderosa pine forests grow at elevations between , on both North and South rims in the Transition life zone. The South Rim includes species such as gray fox, mule deer, bighorn sheep, rock squirrels, pinyon pine, and Utah juniper. Additional species such as Gambel oak, New Mexico locust, mountain mahogany, elderberry, creeping mahonia, and fescue have been identified in these forests. The Utah tiger salamander and the Great Basin spadefoot toad are two amphibians that are common in the rim forests. Of the approximately 90 bird species that breed in the coniferous forests, 51 are summer residents and at least 15 of these are known to be neotropical migrants.

====Canadian and Hudsonian====
Elevations of are in the Canadian Life Zone, which includes the North Rim and the Kaibab Plateau. Spruce-fir forests characterized by Engelmann spruce, blue spruce, Douglas fir, white fir, aspen, and mountain ash, along with several species of perennial grasses, groundsels, yarrow, cinquefoil, lupines, sedges, and asters, grow in this sub-alpine climate. Mountain lions, Kaibab squirrels, and American goshawks are found here.

Montane meadows and subalpine grassland communities of the Hudsonian life zone are rare and located only on the North Rim. Both are typified by many grass species. Some of these grasses include blue and black grama, big galleta, Indian ricegrass, and three-awns. The wettest areas support sedges and forbs.
==Tourism==
Grand Canyon National Park is one of the world&#x27;s premier natural attractions, attracting about five million visitors per year. According to a survey conducted of visitors to the canyon between September 2003 through August 2004, 83% were from the United States: California (12%), Arizona (9%), Texas (5%), Florida (3%) and New York (4%) represented the top domestic visitors. Seventeen percent of visitors were from outside the United States; the most prominently represented nations were the United Kingdom (3%), Canada (4%), Japan (2%), Germany (2%) and the Netherlands (1%).
The South Rim is open all year, weather permitting. The North Rim is generally open mid-May to mid-October.

===Activities===

There are many viewing points on all sides of the canyon, with the most accessible locations inside Grand Canyon National Park and the Hualapai Indian Reservation. About 90% of tourists visit the South Rim from Arizona State Route 64, which averages above sea level. The South Rim houses two visitor centers, a geological museum, art gallery/bookstore, and other attractions near Grand Canyon Village. Further east along the South Rim is the Desert View Watchtower. Grand Canyon National Park also has a visitor center in an easterly area known as the North Rim, via Arizona State Route 67; the center and the road are closed in winter months. On the Hualapai reservation, Grand Canyon West is the third major area with tourist services, about driving from Las Vegas and about by road from Grand Canyon Village at the South Rim. The tribe opened the glass-bottomed Grand Canyon Skywalk in 2007, which has since attracted &quot;thousands of visitors a year, most from Las Vegas&quot;. Also at Grand Canyon West is Guano Point, which features a narrow peninsula surrounded on all sides by steep dropoffs. On the north side of the canyon to the west, the Grand Canyon–Parashant National Monument has no paved roads and no visitor services.

Rafting, hiking, running, and helicopter tours are also popular in the canyon area. The Grand Canyon Ultra Marathon is a race over 24 hours. The floor of the valley is accessible by foot, muleback, or by boat or raft from upriver. Hiking down to the river and back up to the rim in one day is discouraged by park officials because of the distance, steep and rocky trails, change in elevation, and danger of heat exhaustion from the much higher temperatures at the bottom. Rescues are required annually of unsuccessful rim-to-river-to-rim travelers. Nevertheless, hundreds of fit and experienced hikers complete the trip every year.

Camping on the North and South rims is generally restricted to established campgrounds and reservations are highly recommended, especially at the busier South Rim. There is at large camping available along many parts of the North Rim managed by Kaibab National Forest. North Rim campsites are only open seasonally due to road closures from weather and winter snowpack. All overnight camping below the rim requires a backcountry permit from the Backcountry Office (BCO). Each year Grand Canyon National Park receives approximately 30,000 requests for backcountry permits. The park issues 13,000 permits, and close to 40,000 people camp overnight. The earliest a permit application is accepted is the first of the month, four months before the proposed start month.

Tourists wishing for a more vertical perspective can go skydiving, board helicopters and small airplanes in Boulder, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Grand Canyon National Park Airport (seven miles from the South Rim) for canyon flyovers. Scenic flights are no longer allowed to fly within of the rim within the national park because of a late 1990s crash. The last aerial video footage from below the rim was filmed in 1984. However, some helicopter flights land on the Havasupai and Hualapai Indian Reservations within Grand Canyon (outside of the park boundaries).

In 2016, skydiving at the Grand Canyon become possible with the first Grand Canyon Skydiving operation opening up at the Grand Canyon National Park Airport, on the South Rim.

In 2014, a developer announced plans to build a multimedia complex on the canyon&#x27;s rim called the Grand Canyon Escalade. On there would be shops, an IMAX theater, hotels and an RV park. A gondola would enable easy visits to the canyon floor where a &quot;riverwalk&quot; of &quot;connected walkways, an eatery, a tramway station, a seating area and a wastewater package plant&quot; would be situated. On October 31, 2017, the Navajo Nation Council voted against the project.

==Fatalities==
=== Mid-1800s to 2015 ===
About 770 deaths have occurred between the mid-1800s and 2015. Of the fatalities that occurred from 1869 to 2001, some were as follows: 53 resulted from falls; 65 were attributable to environmental causes, including heat stroke, cardiac arrest, dehydration, and hypothermia; 7 were caught in flash floods; 79 were drowned in the Colorado River; 242 perished in airplane and helicopter crashes (128 of them in the 1956 disaster mentioned below); 25 died in freak errors and accidents, including lightning strikes and rock falls; and 23 were the victims of homicides.

====1956 air disaster====
In 1956, the Grand Canyon was the site of the deadliest commercial aviation disaster in history at the time.

On the morning of June 30, 1956, a TWA Lockheed Super Constellation and a United Airlines Douglas DC-7 departed Los Angeles International Airport within three minutes of one another on eastbound transcontinental flights. Approximately 90 minutes later, the two propeller-driven airliners collided above the canyon while both were flying in unmonitored airspace.

The wreckage of both planes fell into the eastern portion of the canyon, on Temple and Chuar Buttes, near the confluence of the Colorado and Little Colorado rivers. The disaster killed all 128 passengers and crew members aboard both planes.

This accident led to the institution of high-altitude airways and direct radar observation of aircraft (known as positive control) by en route ground controllers.

=== &quot;Over the Edge&quot; ===
In &quot;Over the Edge: Death in Grand Canyon&quot;, Thomas M. Myers, a journalist and author, documents every death in the Grand Canyon.

===Charlie Haeger===
On October 3, 2020, former Major League Baseball player Charlie Haeger was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on a canyon trail. He was under investigation for the murder of his ex-girlfriend which had taken place the day before in Scottsdale.

<text>Bryce Canyon National Park () is a national park of the United States located in southwestern Utah. The major feature of the park is Bryce Canyon, which despite its name, is not a canyon, but a collection of giant natural amphitheaters along the eastern side of the Paunsaugunt Plateau. Bryce is distinctive due to geological structures called hoodoos, formed by frost weathering and stream erosion of the river and lake bed sedimentary rock. The red, orange, and white colors of the rocks provide spectacular views for park visitors. Bryce Canyon National Park is much smaller and sits at a much higher elevation than nearby Zion National Park. The rim at Bryce varies from .

The area is in portions of Garfield County and Kane County.

The Bryce Canyon area was settled by Mormon pioneers in the 1850s and was named after Ebenezer Bryce, who homesteaded in the area in 1874. The area was originally designated as a national monument by President Warren G. Harding in 1923 and was redesignated as a national park by Congress in 1928. The park covers and receives substantially fewer visitors than Zion National Park (nearly 4.3 million in 2016) or Grand Canyon National Park (almost 6 million in 2016), largely due to Bryce&#x27;s more remote location. In 2023, Bryce Canyon received 2,461,269.

==Geography==
The park is located in southwestern Utah about northeast of and higher than Zion National Park.

Bryce Canyon National Park lies within the Colorado Plateau geographic province of North America and straddles the southeastern edge of the Paunsaugunt Plateau west of Paunsaugunt Faults (&quot;Paunsaugunt&quot; is Paiute for &quot;home of the beaver&quot;). Park visitors arrive from the plateau and look over its edge toward a valley containing the fault and the Paria River just beyond it (&quot;Paria&quot; is Paiute for &quot;muddy or elk water&quot;). The edge of the Kaiparowits Plateau bounds the opposite side of the valley.

Bryce Canyon was not formed from erosion initiated from a central stream, meaning it technically is not a canyon. Instead headward erosion excavated large amphitheater-shaped features in the Cenozoic-aged rocks of the Paunsaugunt Plateau. This erosion resulted in delicate and colorful pinnacles called hoodoos that are up to high. A series of amphitheaters extends more than north-to-south within the park. The largest is Bryce Amphitheater, which is long, wide and deep. A nearby example of amphitheaters with hoodoos in the same formation but at a higher elevation is in Cedar Breaks National Monument, which is to the west on the Markagunt Plateau.

Rainbow Point, the highest part of the park at , is at the end of the scenic drive. From there, Aquarius Plateau, Bryce Amphitheater, the Henry Mountains, the Vermilion Cliffs and the White Cliffs can be seen. Yellow Creek, where it exits the park in the northeast section, is the lowest part of the park at .
==Climate==

According to the Köppen climate classification system, the park has a continental climate with warm, dry summers (&quot;Dsb&quot;). Dsb climates are defined by having their coldest month at a mean temperature below , all months with a mean temperature below , at least four months with a mean temperature above , and three times as much precipitation in the wettest winter month compared to the driest summer month. The plant hardiness zone at the visitor center is 5b with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of .

The weather in Bryce Canyon is cooler and receives more precipitation than Zion: a total of per year. Yearly temperatures vary from an average minimum of in January to an average maximum of in July, but extreme temperatures can range from . The record high temperature in the park was on July 14, 2002. The record low temperature was on February 6, 1989, and January 13, 1963.

==History==

===Native American habitation===
Little is known about early human habitation in the area. Archaeological surveys of the Paunsaugunt Plateau indicate that people have lived in the area for at least 10,000 years. Basketmaker Anasazi artifacts thousands of years old were found south of the park. Other artifacts from the Pueblo-period Anasazi and the Fremont culture (up to the mid-12th century) were found.

The Paiute Native Americans moved into the area around the time that the other cultures left. These Native Americans hunted and gathered for most of their food, while supplementing their diet with cultivated plants. The Paiute in developed a mythology surrounding the hoodoos. They believed that they were the Legend People whom the trickster Coyote turned to stone. One older Paiute said his culture called the hoodoos &quot;Anka-ku-was-a-wits&quot;, which is Paiute for &quot;red painted faces&quot;.

===European American exploration and settlement===

In the late 18th and early 19th century the first European Americans explored the area. Mormon scouts visited in the 1850s to gauge its potential for agriculture, grazing, and settlement.

The first major scientific expedition was led by U.S. Army Major John Wesley Powell in 1872. Powell, along with a team of mapmakers and geologists, surveyed the Sevier and Virgin River area as part of a larger survey of the Colorado Plateaus. His mapmakers used many Paiute place names.

Small groups of Mormon pioneers followed and attempted to settle east of Bryce Canyon along the Paria River. In 1873, the Kanarra Cattle Company started to graze cattle there.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sent Scottish immigrant Ebenezer Bryce and his wife Mary to settle land in the Paria Valley to apply his carpentry skills. The Bryce family settled right below Bryce Amphitheater—the main collection of hoodoos. Bryce grazed his cattle inside what are now park borders, and reputedly thought that the amphitheaters were a &quot;helluva place to lose a cow.&quot; He built a road to the plateau to retrieve firewood and timber, and a canal to irrigate his crops and water his animals. Other settlers soon started to call the unusual place &quot;Bryce&#x27;s Canyon&quot;, and the name stuck.

A combination of drought, overgrazing, and flooding eventually drove the remaining Paiutes from the area and prompted the settlers to attempt to build a water diversion channel from the Sevier River drainage. That effort failed, leading most settlers, including the Bryce family, to abandon the area. Bryce moved his family to Arizona in 1880. The remaining settlers dug a ditch from the Sevier&#x27;s east fork into Tropic Valley.

===Creation of the park===

These scenic areas were first described to the public in magazine articles published by Union Pacific and Santa Fe railroads in 1916. Forest Supervisor J. W. Humphrey among others promoted the scenic wonders of Bryce Canyon&#x27;s amphitheaters, and by 1918 more articles helped to spark interest. However, poor access to the remote area and the lack of accommodations kept visitation to a bare minimum.

Ruby Syrett, Harold Bowman, and the Perry brothers later established lodging and &quot;touring services&quot;. Syrett later served as the first postmaster. By the early 1920s, the Union Pacific Railroad became interested in expanding rail service into southwestern Utah to accommodate tourists.
Conservationists became alarmed by the damage overgrazing, logging, and unregulated visitation was inflicting on the canyon. A movement to protect the area soon started, and National Park Service Director Stephen Mather responded by proposing that Bryce Canyon be made into a state park. The governor of Utah and the Utah State Legislature lobbied for national protection. Mather relented and sent his recommendation to President Warren G. Harding, who on June 8, 1923, established Bryce Canyon National Monument.

A road was built the same year on the plateau to provide access to outlooks over the amphitheaters. From 1924 to 1925, Bryce Canyon Lodge was built from local timber and stone.

Members of the United States Congress started work in 1924 on upgrading Bryce Canyon&#x27;s protection status from national monument to national park to establish Utah National Park. A process led by the Utah Parks Company for transferring ownership of private and state-held land to the federal government started in 1923. The last of the land was acquired four years later, and on February 25, 1928, Bryce Canyon National Park was established.

In 1931, President Herbert Hoover annexed an adjoining area south of the park, and in 1942 an additional was added. This brought the park&#x27;s total area to the ultimate . Rim Road, a scenic drive, was completed in 1934 by the Civilian Conservation Corps. Park administration was conducted from Zion National Park until 1956 when Bryce Canyon&#x27;s first superintendent started work.

===Later===
The USS &quot;Bryce Canyon&quot;, named for the park, served as a supply and repair ship in the U.S. Pacific Fleet from September 15, 1950, to June 30, 1981.

Bryce Canyon Natural History Association (BCNHA) is a non-profit organization, established in 1961. It runs the bookstore inside the park visitor center and support interpretive, educational, and scientific activities. A portion of the profits from all bookstore sales are donated to public land units. 

Responding to increased visitation and traffic congestion, NPS implemented a voluntary, summer-only, in-park shuttle system in June 2000. In 2004, reconstruction began on the road system.

On April 7, 2020, Bryce Canyon National Park was closed to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, before a phased reopening started on May 6, 2020.

==Geology==

The Bryce Canyon area experienced soil deposition that spans from the last part of the Cretaceous period and the first half of the Cenozoic era. The ancient depositional environment varied. Dakota Sandstone and Tropic Shale were deposited in the warm, shallow waters of the advancing and retreating Cretaceous Seaway (outcrops of these rocks are found just outside park borders).

Other formations were created, but mostly eroded away following two major periods of uplift. The Laramide orogeny affected the entire western part of what would become North America starting about 70 million to 50 MYA. This event helped to build the Rocky Mountains and in the process closed the Cretaceous Seaway. The Straight Cliffs, Wahweap, and Kaiparowits formations were victims of this uplift. The Colorado Plateaus rose 16 MYA and were segmented into plateaus, separated by faults and each having its own uplift rate.
This uplift created vertical joints, which over time preferentially eroded. The soft Pink Cliffs of the Claron Formation eroded to form freestanding hoodoo pinnacles in badlands, while the more resistant White Cliffs formed monoliths. The brown, pink, and red colors are from hematite (iron oxide; ); the yellows from limonite (); and the purples are from pyrolusite ().

==Ecology==

More than 400 native plant species live in the park. The three life zones in the park are based on elevation: The lowest areas are dominated by dwarf forests of pinyon pine and juniper with manzanita, serviceberry, and antelope bitterbrush in between. Aspen, cottonwood, water birch, and willow grow along streams. Ponderosa pine forests cover the mid-elevations with blue spruce and Douglas fir in water-rich areas and manzanita and bitterbrush as underbrush. Douglas fir and white fir, along with aspen and Engelmann spruce, make up the forests on the Paunsaugunt Plateau. The harshest areas have limber pine and ancient Great Basin bristlecone pine, some more than 1,600 years old.

The forests and meadows support diverse animal life including foxes, badgers, porcupines, elk, skunks, black bears, bobcats, and woodpeckers. Mule deer are the most common large mammals. Elk and pronghorn, which have been reintroduced nearby, sometimes appear.
The park forms part of the habitat of three wildlife species listed under the Endangered Species Act: the Utah prairie dog, the California condor, and the southwestern willow flycatcher. The Utah prairie dog is a threatened species that was reintroduced to the park. The largest protected population is found in the park.

About 170 species of birds visit the park each year, including swifts and swallows. Most species migrate to warmer regions in winter, although jays, ravens, nuthatches, eagles, and owls do not. In winter, the mule deer, cougars, and coyotes migrate to lower elevations. Ground squirrels and marmots pass the winter in hibernation.

Eleven species of reptiles and four species of amphibians have been found. Reptiles include the Great Basin rattlesnake, short-horned lizard, side-blotched lizard, striped whipsnake, and amphibians include the tiger salamander.

Also in the park are the black, lumpy, very slow-growing colonies of cryptobiotic soil, which are a mix of lichens, algae, fungi, and cyanobacteria. Together these organisms slow erosion, add nitrogen to the soil, and help it to retain moisture.

==Activities==
Most park visitors travel the scenic drive, which provides access to 13 viewpoints over the amphitheaters.

In total, of trails criss-cross the park. Bryce Canyon has eight marked and maintained day hikes:

&quot;Easy to moderate hikes&quot;

*Mossy Cave (one hour, State Route 12 northwest of Tropic)
*Rim Trail (5–6 hours, anywhere on the rim)
*Bristlecone Loop (one hour, Rainbow Point), and Queens Garden (1–2 hours, Sunrise Point)

&quot;Moderate hikes&quot;

*Navajo Loop (1–2 hours, Sunset Point)
*Tower Bridge (2–3 hours, north of Sunrise Point)

&quot;Strenuous hikes&quot;

*Fairyland Loop (4–5 hours, Fairyland Point)
*Peekaboo Loop (3–4 hours, Bryce Point)

Several of the trails intersect, allowing hikers to arrange routes for more challenging hikes.

The park has two trails designated for overnight trips: the Riggs Spring Loop Trail and the Under-the-Rim Trail. Both require a backcountry camping permit.
More than of marked but ungroomed skiing trails are available off of Fairyland, Paria, and Rim trails. of connecting groomed ski trails are in nearby Dixie National Forest and Ruby&#x27;s Inn.

The air is so clear that on most days Navajo Mountain and the Kaibab Plateau can be seen away in Arizona from Yovimpa and Rainbow points. On clear days, the Black Mesas of eastern Arizona and western New Mexico can be seen some away.

The park has a 7.4 magnitude night sky, one of the darkest in North America. Stargazers can, therefore, see 7,500 stars, while in most places fewer than 2,000 can be seen due to light pollution, and in many large cities only a few dozen are visible. Park rangers host public stargazing events and evening programs on astronomy, nocturnal animals, and night sky protection. The Bryce Canyon Astronomy Festival, typically held in June, attracts thousands of visitors. In honor of this festival, Asteroid 49272 was named after the national park.

The two campgrounds are North Campground and Sunset Campground. Loop A in North Campground is open year-round. Additional loops and Sunset Campground are open from late spring to early autumn. The 114-room Bryce Canyon Lodge is another way to stay overnight.

<text>Czech literature can refer to literature written in Czech, in the Czech Republic (formerly Czechoslovakia, earlier the Lands of the Bohemian Crown), or by Czech people.

Most literature in the Czech Republic is now written in Czech, but historically, a considerable part of Czech literary output was written in other languages as well, including Latin and German.

==Middle Latin works==

Bohemia was Christianized in the late 9th to 10th centuries, and the earliest written works associated with the kingdom of Bohemia are Middle Latin works written in the 12th to 13th centuries (with the exception of the Latin &quot;Legend of Christian&quot;, supposedly of the 10th century but of dubious authenticity).
The majority of works from this period are chronicles and hagiographies. Bohemian hagiographies focus exclusively on Bohemian saints (Sts. Ludmila, Wenceslas, Procopius, Cyril and Methodius, and Adalbert), although numerous legends about Bohemian saints were also written by foreign authors. The most important chronicle of the period is the Chronica Boemorum (Bohemian Chronicle) by Cosmas, though it does approach its topics with then-contemporary politics in mind, and attempts to legitimize the ruling dynasty. Cosmas&#x27; work was updated and extended by several authors in the latter part of the 12th and during the 13th centuries.
During the first part of the 13th century, the Přemyslid rulers of Bohemia expanded their political and economic influence westward and came into contact with the political and cultural kingdoms of Western Europe. This cultural exchange was evident in literature through the introduction of German courtly poetry, or Minnesang, in the latter part of the 13th century. After the murder of Wenceslas III and the subsequent upheavals in the kingdom in 1306, however, the Bohemian nobles distanced themselves from German culture and looked for literature in their native language. Despite this, German remained an important literary language in Bohemia until the 19th century. This new literature in Czech consisted largely of epic poetry of two types: the legend and the knightly epic, both based on apocryphal tales from the Bible, as well as hagiographic legends of earlier periods. Prose was also first developed during this period: administrative and instructional texts, which necessitated the development of a more extensive and specialized vocabulary; the first Czech-Latin dictionaries date from this time. Extensive chronicles, of which the &quot;Chronicle of Dalimil&quot; and &quot;Chronicon Aulae Regiae&quot; (the &quot;Zbraslav Chronicle&quot;) are the most striking examples, and artistic prose (e.g. Smil Flaška z Pardubic and Johannes von Saaz) were also written.

==Reformation==

The Hussite revolution of the 15th century created a definite break in the literary evolution of Czech literature and forms its own separate history within Czech literature. The main aim of this literature was to communicate and argue for a specific religious doctrine and its form was generally prose. Jan Hus theological writing first appears at the beginning of the 15th century; he wrote first in Latin, later in Czech, and this divide remained for much of the later period: poetry and intellectual prose used primarily Latin, whereas popular prose was written in Czech or German. Hus writings center on technical, theological questions; however, he did publish a set of his Czech sermons and created rules of orthography and grammar that would be used to create the foundations of modern Czech in the 17th and 18th centuries. 
Only fragments remain of the literary works of the radical Taborite faction – these were generally Latin apologia defending the Taborite doctrine (Mikuláš Biskupec z Pelhřimova, Petr Chelčický). In general, Hussite writings differed from the preceding era by their focus on social questions – their audience consisted of the lower and lower middle classes. Works defending Catholicism and attacking the Hussite utraquists were also written, one example being Jan Rokycana&#x27;s works. The Hussite period also developed the genre of Czech religious songs as a replacement for Latin hymns and liturgy, e.g. the &quot;Jistebnický kancionál&quot;, the Jistebnice Hymnal.

After the election of George of Poděbrady to the Czech throne following the Hussite wars, a new cultural wave swept into Bohemia. Humanism saw in the classics of antiquity an ideal for literature and culture. The main feature of the literature of this period is the competition between Catholics writing in Latin, e.g. Bohuslav Hasištejnský z Lobkovic and Jan Dubravius) and Protestants writing in Czech, e.g. Viktorin Kornel of Všehrdy and Václav Hájek. New literary devices incited scholars, e.g. Veleslavín, to construct a more complex grammatical structure, based on Latin, as well as an influx of loan words. Gutenberg&#x27;s printing press rendered books and pamphlets more accessible, which slowly changed literature&#x27;s status in society.

==Baroque period==

The demise of the Czech Protestants after the Battle of the White Mountain decidedly affected Czech literary development. The forceful re-Catholicization and Germanization of Bohemia and the ensuing confiscations and expulsions virtually eliminated the Protestant middle classes and split the literature into two parts: the domestic Catholic and the émigré Protestant branches. Unlike in other European countries of the time, the nobility in Bohemia was not a part of the literary audience and thus this split of literary effort led to a certain lack of development and stagnation of Czech baroque literature in comparison to other European countries of the time, especially in genres that were written for noble courts. The largest personality of Czech evangelical baroque writing is John Comenius, who spent his youth in Bohemia but was forced into exile later in life. He was a pedagogue, theologian, reformer of education, and philosopher; his works include grammars, theoretical tracts on education, and works on theology. With his death in the late 17th century, Protestant literature in Czech virtually disappeared. Catholic baroque works span two types: religious poetry such as that of Adam Michna z Otradovic, Fridrich Bridel and Václav Jan Rosa, and religious prose writings (i.e. homiletic prose and hagiographies), and historical accounts (Bohuslav Balbín), as well as the Jesuit St. Wenceslas Bible.

==The Enlightenment==

At the end of the 18th century, the Bohemian lands underwent a considerable change – the Habsburg emperor Josef II put an end to the feudal system and supported a new religious and ideological tolerance. Enlightened classicism emerged, which sought to apply the principles of rational science to all aspects of daily life. A national culture and literature in one&#x27;s own national language began to be seen as a prerequisite for the unification of a nation. In literature, this constituted a renewed interest in prose novels (e.g. Václav Matěj Kramerius), in Czech history and in the historical development of Czech culture (e.g. Josef Dobrovský, who re-codified the grammar of Czech and Antonín Jaroslav Puchmayer, who systematically set out to develop a Czech poetic style). The literary audience evolved from priests and monks to the laity and general public and literature began to be seen as a vehicle of artistic expression. Bohemia and Moravia, however, remained within the sphere of Austrian and German cultural influence. The new national literature thus firstly mimicked popular German genres and would only later evolve into an independent creative effort; this was especially true for drama, e.g. Václav Kliment Klicpera.

==19th century==
Pre-romanticism formed the transition between enlightened classicism and romanticism – the pre-romantics did not completely abandon the emphasis on poetic forms drawn from antiquity, but relaxed the strict separation between the genres and turned away from didactic genres toward more lyric, folk-inspired works (e.g. Ján Kollár and František Čelakovský.) It was during this period that the idea of a truly national literature and culture developed, as a rejection of Bernard Bolzano&#x27;s vision of a bi-lingual and bi-cultural Czech-German state. The perhaps greatest figure of this era is Josef Jungmann, who translated many classics of world literature and spent his life establishing Czech literature as a serious, rich literature capable of great development. František Palacký and Pavel Jozef Šafárik took up the challenge of reexamining Czech history. As part of the effort to establish a pedigree for Czech literature and culture, Czech historians of the time sought evidence of heroic epics of the Middle Ages. They appeared to find such evidence in the &quot;Rukopis královédvorský&quot; and &quot;Rukopis zelenohorský&quot; (the &quot;Dvůr Králové Manuscript&quot; and the &quot;Zelená Hora Manuscript&quot;, respectively), although both were later proven forgeries.
By the 1830s, the foundations of Czech literature were laid and authors now began to focus more on the artistic merits of their work and less on developing the idea of Czech literature and culture as a whole. During this time period two main types of literature were produced: Biedermeier literature, which strove to educate the readers and encourage them to be loyal to the Austro-Hungarian Empire (e.g. Karel Jaromír Erben and Božena Němcová), and romanticism, which emphasized the freedom of the individual and focused on subjectivity and the subconscious (e.g. Karel Hynek Mácha, Václav Bolemír Nebeský.) These authors were generally published in either newspapers or in the literary magazine &quot;Květy&quot; (&quot;Blossoms&quot;) published by Josef Kajetán Tyl.

The year 1848 brought to the fore a new generation of Czech authors who followed in the footsteps of Mácha, and published their work in the new almanac &quot;Máj&quot; (&quot;May&quot;) (e.g. Vítězslav Hálek, Karolina Světlá and Jan Neruda). These authors rejected the narrow ideal of a purely national culture and favored one that incorporated Czech literature into European culture and drew inspiration from the progress made outside of the Czech lands. Their work, however, also commented on the encroachment of industrialization and focused increasingly on the simple life as opposed to the unfettered romantic ideal.

The May generation was followed by the neo-romantics, who continued in the romantic tradition, but also incorporated more contemporary styles: realism, Symbolism, and decadence. Three periods are apparent: the first reacted to the disappointment due to the lack of political and social progress during the 1870s (e.g. Václav Šolc); the second was the great return to poetry, especially epic poetry (e.g. Josef Václav Sládek); and the third focused on prose (e.g. Alois Jirásek).

In conversation with the neo-romantics, the next generation of authors leaned toward realism and naturalism, the ordinary and banal. They favored contemporary subjects over historical ones, and sought to deemphasize the personal voice of the author in comparison to the often highly colored speech of the characters. Two main topics were of interest: the exploration of the Czech village and the extent to which it remained an oasis of good morals (Jan Herben, Karel Václav Rais, Alois Mrštík); and Prague, especially the life of the lower classes (Ignát Herrman, Karel Matěj Čapek Chod).

The last literary generation of the 19th century signaled a decided break with the past and the advent of modernism – after the wave of optimism in the wake of the French Revolution at the beginning of the century, the lack of progress in implementing these ideals of freedom and brotherhood led to both a skepticism toward the possibility of ever achieving these ideals, and renewed efforts to do so. The common link between authors of this generation is their adherence to a particular style over their own voices, and their often very critical perspectives on the work of the previous generations. The modernists also inaugurated the cult of the artist, and this period saw the birth of the literary critic as an independent profession, as an ally of the artist, helping to both define and present work to the public (František Xaver Šalda). Notable poets of this period drew on the works and translations of the poet Jaroslav Vrchlický and include, among others, Josef Svatopluk Machar, Antonín Sova, Otokar Březina, and Karel Hlaváček); prose authors include Vilém Mrštík, Růžena Svobodová, and Josef Karel Šlejhar.

==20th century==

The turn of the 20th century marked a profound shift in Czech literature — after nearly a century of work, literature finally freed itself from the confines of needing to educate and serve the nation and spread Czech culture, and became literature simply for the sake of art. The orientation toward France, Northern Europe, and Russia intensified, and new demands were laid on the cultural knowledge of authors and their audience.

The new generation of poets distanced themselves from both the neo-romantics and the modernists: led by S. K. Neumann, their work focused on concrete reality, free of any pathos, or complicated symbolism. Many of the new poets (Karel Toman, Fráňa Šrámek, Viktor Dyk, František Gellner, Petr Bezruč) allied themselves with anarchism and the women&#x27;s movement, although this influence waned throughout the decade. In prose, the work of the modernist generation was only now coming into its own, but the different stylistic waves that affected their prose are also evident in the work of the new generation — naturalism (A. M. Tilschová); impressionism (Šrámek, Gellner, Jiří Mahen, Jan Opolský, Rudolf Těsnohlídek); the Vienna Secession (Růžena Svobodová, Jiří Karásek ze Lvovic).

After their rebellious first decade, the new generation of poets (Toman, Neumann, Šrámek) turned toward nature and life in their work. This decade also marked the return of Catholic authors (Josef Florian, Jakub Deml, Jaroslav Durych, Josef Váchal) and the first entrance of the avant-garde into Czech literature, seeking to document the rapid changes in society and modernization. The first avantgarde style was neoclassicism, which soon gave way to cubism, futurism, and civilism (S. K. Neumann, the young brothers Čapek).

World War I brought with it a wave of repression of the newly emergent Czech culture, and this meant a return to the past, to traditional Czech values and history: the Hussites and the Awakening. The war, however, also precipitated a crisis of values, of faith in progress, religion, and belief, which found outlet in expressionism (Ladislav Klíma, Jakub Deml, Richard Weiner), civilism (Čapek brothers) and visions of a universal brotherhood of mankind (Ivan Olbracht, Karel Matěj Čapek Chod, F. X. Šalda).

The interwar period, coinciding with the First Republic, is one of the apogees of Czech literature — the new state brought with it a plurality of thinking, religion, and philosophy, leading to a great flowering of literature and culture. The first major theme of the interwar period was the war — the inhumanity, violence, and terror, but also the heroic actions of the Czech Legion (Rudolf Medek, Josef Kopta, František Langer, Jaroslav Hašek). An antiwar comedy novel &quot;The Good Soldier Švejk&quot; by Jaroslav Hašek is the most translated novel of the Czech literature (58 languages as of 2013).

A new generation of poets ushered in the return of the avantgarde: poetry of the heart (early Jiří Wolker, Zdeněk Kalista) and naivism (Čapek brothers, Josef Hora, Jaroslav Seifert, and S. K. Neumann). The avantgarde soon split, however, into the radical proletarian socialist and communist authors (Wolker, Neumann, Karel Teige, Antonín Matěj Píša, Hora, Jindřich Hořejší), the Catholics (Durych, Deml), and to the centrists (brothers Čapek, Dyk, Fischer, Šrámek, Langer, Jan Herben). A specifically Czech literary style, poetism, was developed by the group Devětsil (Vítězslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert, Konstantin Biebl, Karel Teige), which argued that poetry should pervade everyday life, that poetry is inseparable from daily life, that everyone is a poet. Prose of the interwar period distanced itself even more from the traditional, single perspective prose of the previous century, in favor of multiple perspectives, subjectivity, and fractured narratives. Utopian and fantastic literature came into the forefront (Jan Weiss, Karel Čapek, Eduard Bass, Jiří Haussmann), as well as the genres of documentary prose, which sought to paint as accurate a picture of the world as possible (Karel Čapek, Egon Erwin Kisch, Jiří Weil, Rudolf Těsnohlídek, Eduard Bass, Jaromír John, Karel Poláček); lyrical, imaginative prose that allied itself with the poetic poetry of the time (Karel Konrád, Jaroslav Jan Paulík, Vladislav Vančura); and Catholically-oriented prose (Jaroslav Durych, Jan Čep, Jakub Deml). The drama of the time also followed the same stylistic evolution as poetry and prose — expressionism, followed by a return to realistic, civilian theater (František Langer, Karel Čapek). Along with avantgarde poetry, avantgarde theater also flourished, focusing on removing the barriers between actors and audience, breaking the illusion of the unity of a theatrical work (Osvobozené divadlo, Jiří Voskovec and Jan Werich).

After the heady optimism of the 1920s, the 1930s brought with them an economic crisis, which helped spur a political crisis: both the left (Communist) and right (anti-German and fascist) parties radicalized and threatened the stability of the democracy. This led the authors of the time to focus on public matters and spirituality; Catholicism gained in importance (Kalista, Karel Schulz, Halas, Vančura, Durych). Changes were apparent first in poetry: the new generation of poets (Bohuslav Reynek, Vilém Závada, František Halas, Vladimír Holan, Jan Zahradníček) began as poets, but their work is much darker, full of images of death and fear. The older avantgarde (Teige, Nezval) also turned away from poetism to surrealism, and a third group (Hora, Seifert, František Hrubín) turned instead to lyricism, to quiet, memory-filled poetry. Prose, after the years of realistic journalism, turned to epics, existential novels, and subjective perspectives. Folk-inspired ballads (Josef Čapek, K. Čapek, Vančura, Ivan Olbracht), social-themed novels (Olbracht, Vančura, Poláček, Marie Majerová, Marie Pujmanová), and psychological novels (Jarmila Glazarová, Egon Hostovský, Jaroslav Havlíček) appeared. During this period, Karel Čapek wrote his most politically charged (and well-known) plays in response to the rise of fascist dictators. After the Munich Agreement in 1938, literature once more mirrored the current political present and called for national solidarity and a return to the past.

The German protectorate and World War II left its mark on Czech literature — many of the authors of the interwar generations did not survive or went into exile. During 1938–1940, society was still relatively free, but during 1941, most of the free newspapers, magazines, and publishers were shut down, and authors were silenced. WWII thus marks the origin of the 3-way split of literature that continued throughout the socialist years until 1989: domestic published, domestic illegal, and exile literature. As a result of the war, all forms of literature turned even more toward tradition and history: poetry became more subdued, and greater emphasis was laid upon language as an expression of national identity (Hora, Halas, Seifert, Nezval), and on spirituality and religious values (Hrubín, Závada, Zahradníček, Holan). The same occurred in prose: gone were the experimental works of the interwar period, but the social and psychological novel (Václav Řezáč, Vladimír Neff, Miloš Václav Kratochvíl) remained. The historical novel marked a new resurgence (Kratochvíl, Vančura, Durych, Schulz) as a way to write about the present while cloaking it in historical novels, as did prose inspired by folk tales and folk culture (Josef Štefan Kubín, Jan Drda, Vančura, Jaromír John, Zdeněk Jirotka). The generation of authors that debuted during the war and shortly afterwards (Jiří Orten, Group 42) all shared a similar harrowing experience of the war; their works all bear the hallmark of tragedy, existentialist thought, and the focus on the person as an isolated being.

Czech postwar literature is tightly intertwined with the political state of postwar Czechoslovakia; as during the war, literature broke apart into three main branches: domestic published, domestic illegal, and exile literature. Literature under the communist regime became the refuge of freedom and democracy, and literary works and authors were valued not only for their literary merits, but also for their struggle against the regime. The literature of the entire postwar period thus enjoyed great attention, despite its often precarious position. During the first three years after the end of the war (1945–1948), however, literature maintained a certain degree of freedom, although the strengthening of the extreme left gradually pushed out of the public sphere first the Catholic authors (Deml, Durych, Čep, Zahradníček), then the moderate Communists.

1948 brought the ultimate victory of the Communists, and the subsequent end of civil freedoms — any literature contrary to the official perspective was banned and the authors persecuted. The official literary style became socialist realism and all avantgarde leanings were suppressed. Many authors went into exile — to Germany, the U.S., the Vatican. Of those that stayed, many chose to write in secret and remain unpublished (the surrealists (Zbyněk Havlíček, Karel Hynek), Holan, Zahradníček, Jiří Kolář, Josef Jedlička, Jan Hanč, Jiřina Hauková, Josef Škvorecký, Egon Bondy, Jan Zábrana, Bohumil Hrabal). Most of their works were published only during the 1960s and 1990s.

Only at the end of the 1950s did the tight censorial control begin to ease — some poets were allowed to publish again (Hrubín, Oldřich Mikulášek, Jan Skácel) and a new literary group formed around the magazine &quot;Květen&quot;, striving to break the hold of socialist realism (Miroslav Holub, Karel Šiktanc, Jiří Šotola). Prose lagged behind poetry for much of the period, with the exception of Edvard Valenta and Josef Škvorecký. Shorter works, such as the short story also became popular again.

The 1960s brought with them the beginnings of reform efforts in the Communist party, and the subsequent liberalization of literature and increasing prestige of authors. Beginning with 1964, literature began to broaden in scope beyond the officially approved style. In poetry, intimate lyricism became popular (Vladimír Holan), as well as epic poetry (Karel Šiktanc, Hrubín), and the realism of Group 42. In prose, new authors abandoned polemics about socialism and instead turned toward personal and civic morality (Jan Trefulka, Milan Kundera, Ivan Klíma, Pavel Kohout), the theme of war and occupation (Jiří Weil, Arnošt Lustig), especially the fate of Jews. Bohumil Hrabal became the most prominent of the contemporary prose authors, with his works full of colloquialisms and non-traditional narrative structures, and the absence of official moral frameworks. Toward the end of the decade, novels of disillusionment, skepticism, and a need to find one&#x27;s place in the world and history begin to appear (Vaculík, M. Kundera, Hrubín), as do modern historical novels (Oldřich Daněk, Jiří Šotola, Vladimír Körner, Ota Filip). The 1960s also brought the debuts of a new generation of authors who grew up during the excesses of Stalinism, and thus had no ideals about world utopias — their works dealt not with changing the world, but with living in it: authenticity, responsibility both moral and literary. These included the poets Jiří Gruša, Josef Hanzlík, Antonín Brousek, Jiří Kuběna, and playwrights Ivan Vyskočil, Jiří Šlitr, Václav Havel, Milan Uhde, Josef Topol. The close of the reform years also saw a return to experiments: surrealism (Milan Nápravník, Vratislav Effenberger), nonsense poetry (Emanuel Frynta), experimental poetry (Josef Hiršal, Bohumila Grögerová, Emil Juliš), abstract poetry and dada (Ladislav Novák), gritty realistic prose (Jan Hanč, Vladimír Páral) and ornate, symbol filled fantasy (Věra Linhartová). The era of literary freedom and experiments, which reached its apogee during the Prague Spring of 1968, came to an abrupt end the same summer, with the Soviet invasion and subsequent &quot;normalization.&quot;

Normalization reinstated the severe censorship of the 1950s, shut down most of the literary magazines and newspapers, and silenced authors who did not conform. More than ever before, literature split into the legal, illegal, and exile branches. Many authors fled to the U.S. and Canada (Josef Škvorecký), Germany (Peroutka), Austria (Kohout), France (M. Kundera), but they generally did not fare much better than their contemporaries in Czechoslovakia, largely due to the absence of a readership. Their works became better known only through translations. The work of experimental, avantgarde authors who continued to publish as &quot;official&quot; authors generally shrank in quality, conformed to the official dogma, although in comparison to the 1950s, the literature was less rigid, less wooden. On the border between official and unofficial literature stood authors of historical novels (Korner, Karel Michal), and well as Bohumil Hrabal and Ota Pavel. Seifert, Mikulášek, Skácel were all also barred from publishing; their work was published as samizdat, small underground presses that hand-published much of the work of the underground, illegal authors. Ludvík Vaculík, , and Václav Havel and Jan Lopatka organized the largest samizdat editions. It was many of these illegal authors who signed Charta 77 and were jailed for doing so. Samizdat literature again returned to Catholicism, to memoirs and diaries of daily life (Vaculík). Memory and history were also chief motifs of samizdat literature (Karel Šiktanc, Jiřina Hauková), as were brutally honest, factual testimonials of daily life (Ivan Martin Jirous). The new literary generation of the 1980s was marked by the need to rebel, to act outside of the bounds of society — their work draws on the war generation (Group 42), and is often brutal, aggressive, and vulgar (Jáchym Topol, Petr Placák, Zuzana Brabcová); postmodernism also influenced literature as a whole (Jiří Kratochvil, Daniela Hodrová).

The fall of communism in 1989 marked another break in Czech literature — plurality and freedom returned. The works of many of the illegal and exiled authors working under the communist regime were published for the first time (for instance Jan Křesadlo and Ivan Blatný) and many of them returned to public life and publishing. Although some critics would say that contemporary Czech literature (since 1989) is relatively marginalised in comparison with Czech film-making, writers such as Petr Šabach, Ivan Martin Jirous, Jáchym Topol, Miloš Urban, Patrik Ouředník, Petra Hůlová, Michal Viewegh and Kateřina Tučková are public figures and sell books in large numbers. Contemporary Czech poetry, in Petr Borkovec can boast a poet of European standing.

<text>Jaroslav Foglar (6 July 1907 – 23 January 1999) was a Czechoslovak writer who wrote many novels about youths (partly also about the Boy Scouts movement) and their adventures in nature and dark city streets. His signature series is &quot;Rychlé šípy&quot;, which was adapted into comics by Jan Fischer.

==Early life==

Foglar was born in 1907 and grew up in Prague. Because his father died prematurely, he was brought up in rather poor material conditions by his mother. To earn some extra money young &quot;Slavik&quot; used to copy the popular detective stories, &quot;cliftonky&quot;, earning 20 heller per copy. (This initially affected his literary style, and some of the first editions of his books were corrected later, to get rid of the literary slag.)

He was strongly influenced by the romantic parts of Prague. All of the fictional towns in his novels are more or less derived from it. During the 1920s, Foglar was strongly influenced by the German independent Wandervogel movement as well as the Scout movement led by Antonín Benjamin Svojsík under the Czech name Junák.

==Writer and editor career, prohibited writer and the end of life==
During the 1930s and 1940s, Foglar worked as a magazine editor in one of the largest Prague publishing houses, Melantrich. He edited several journals for youths:
* &quot;Mladý hlasatel&quot; (&quot;Young herald&quot;), 1938–1941
* &quot;Junák&quot; (&quot;Scout&quot;), 1945–1949
* &quot;Vpřed&quot; (&quot;Ahead&quot;), 1946–1948
and he wrote articles for other journals including the &quot;Skaut&quot;, &quot;Sluníčko&quot;, &quot;ABC&quot;, and the &quot;Tramp&quot;.

After the Communist coup in 1948 Foglar was kicked out of the publishing house, his magazines were liquidated and his books prohibited, as was the Scout movement and independent youth clubs. For many years he worked as a tutor in boarding schools and youth homes. During the fall of censorship at the end of the 1960s, he published some new books and re-editions of the older ones. After the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia his books were once again banned until 1989.

Foglar lived with his mother, caring for her until her death in high age, and never married.
==Scout versus Youth Club movement==
Although Foglar worked as a Boy Scout leader, his relation to the Scout movement was not straightforward. He portrayed the Boy Scouts only in a few of his novels (especially &quot;Pod junackou vlajkou&quot; and &quot;Devadesatka pokracuje&quot;), preferring to write mostly about his own invention, the boy clubs. 

Foglar&#x27;s idea of independent boy clubs is basically derived from the German Wandervogel movement. As editor of &quot;Mladý Hlasatel&quot;, Foglar systematically built clubbist ideology (based on friendship, good deeds, personal sacrifice, love of the nature, etc.) on some and traditions and own terminology. Clubs were small groups between 4 and 8 youths. Some of them were informally led by young men few years older than the other youths, like Rikitan in the novel &quot;Hoši od Bobří řeky&quot; or by the best of the youths - like the &#x27;exemplary youth&#x27; Mirek Dušín of the Rychlé šípy Club. 

With Foglar&#x27;s novels and magazine articles as examples, many Czech youths established such clubs. In the golden age of club movement, there were thousands of such independent clubs, which presented a type of Wandervogel-like alternative to the organized Scout movement. On the other hand, when Scouts were persecuted and forbidden during the German occupation between 1938 and 1945 and during Communism between 1948 and 1989 (with the short exception of renewal of Scout during 1968 and 1969), boy clubs posed an excellent informal alternative of youth life based on ideas similar to those of the Scouts.

==Ideal friendship and Ideal of male education==
One of the key themes of Foglar&#x27;s novels is the tension between the loneliness and close friendship between young male heroes. These are especially distinctive in the novels &#x27;Přístav volá&#x27;, &#x27;Když duben přichází&#x27;, &#x27;Chata v Jezerní kotlině&#x27;, &#x27;Modrá rokle&#x27; and &#x27;Tajemná Řásnovka&#x27;. These novels are also non-scout ones, picturing independent life of youths. On the other hand, in a second large group of his novels, a &#x27;group hero&#x27; novels, the plot is based on stories of some organized group of youths, with less individual psychology and more action and adventures. The heroes are boy scouts or independent clubbists.

==Homoerotic elements in his novels==

Some critics argued that Foglar&#x27;s novels are crammed with covert homoerotic desire, or that the author himself was gay. Foglar was strongly influenced by German Wandervogel romanticism more than the ideas of British scout movement (which emerged in Czech Lands during the WWI). Wandervogel movement itself had some elements of male eroticism. Most of Foglar&#x27;s novels include close friendships between two youths, with some exceptions in relation to the &#x27;group-hero&#x27; novels like &#x27;Rychlé šípy&#x27; Club and &#x27;Devadesátka&#x27;. 

Foglar&#x27;s novels are set in a prevalently male world, where women are often irrelevant (old grannies or small girls, often without names). This homosociality was very common in literature of the period, regardless of the sexual orientation of the author. Besides, there are also a few strong female characters in his books, and especially in his comic series &quot;Rychlé šípy&quot;. Foglar did have a few serious (though eventually unsuccessful) love affairs with women.

<doc id="46996" wikidata="Q175121" url="?curid=46996" title="Marcus Licinius Crassus">
<text>Marcus Licinius Crassus (; 115–53 BC) was a Roman general and statesman who played a key role in the transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. He is often called &quot;the richest man in Rome&quot;.

Crassus began his public career as a military commander under Lucius Cornelius Sulla during his civil war. Following Sulla&#x27;s assumption of the dictatorship, Crassus amassed an enormous fortune through property speculation. Crassus rose to political prominence following his victory over the slave revolt led by Spartacus, sharing the consulship with his rival Pompey the Great.

A political and financial patron of Julius Caesar, Crassus joined Caesar and Pompey in the unofficial political alliance known as the First Triumvirate. Together, the three men dominated the Roman political system, but the alliance did not last long, due to the ambitions, egos, and jealousies of the three men. While Caesar and Crassus were lifelong allies, Crassus and Pompey disliked each other and Pompey grew increasingly envious of Caesar&#x27;s spectacular successes in the Gallic Wars. The alliance was restabilized at the Luca Conference in 56 BC, after which Crassus and Pompey again served jointly as consuls. Following his second consulship, Crassus was appointed as the governor of Roman Syria, which he used as the launchpad for a military campaign against the Parthian Empire, Rome&#x27;s long-time eastern enemy. Crassus&#x27; campaign was a disastrous failure, ending in his defeat at the Battle of Carrhae and death in its aftermath.

Crassus&#x27; death permanently unraveled the alliance between Caesar and Pompey, since his political influence and wealth had been a counterbalance to the two greater militarists. Within four years of Crassus&#x27; death, Caesar crossed the Rubicon and began a civil war against Pompey and the &quot;optimates&quot;.

==Family and background==
Marcus Licinius Crassus was a member of the &quot;gens Licinia&quot;, an old and highly respected plebeian family in Rome. He was the second of three sons born to the eminent senator and &quot;vir triumphalis&quot; Publius Licinius Crassus (consul 95 BC, censor 89 BC). This line was not descended from the wealthy Crassi Divites, although often assumed to be. The eldest brother, Publius (born ), died shortly before the Italic War, and Crassus&#x27; father and younger brother were either slain or took their own lives in Rome, in winter 87–86 BC, when being hunted down by the supporters of Gaius Marius, following their victory in the &quot;Bellum Octavianum&quot;. Crassus had the unusual distinction of marrying his wife Tertulla after she had been widowed by his brother.

There were three main branches of the house of the Licinii Crassi in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, and many mistakes in identifications and lines have arisen owing to the uniformity of Roman nomenclature, erroneous modern suppositions, and the unevenness of information across the generations. In addition, the &quot;Dives&quot; cognomen of the Crassi Divites means rich or wealthy, and since Marcus Crassus, the subject here, was renowned for his enormous wealth, this has contributed to hasty assumptions that his family belonged to the Divites. But no ancient source accords him or his father the Dives cognomen; Plutarch says his great wealth was acquired rather than inherited, and that he was raised in modest circumstances.

Crassus&#x27; grandfather of the same name, Marcus Licinius Crassus (praetor c. 126 BC), was facetiously given the Greek nickname Agelastus (the unlaughing or grim) by his contemporary Gaius Lucilius, the inventor of Roman satire, who asserted that he smiled once in his whole life. This grandfather was son of Publius Licinius Crassus. The latter&#x27;s brother, Gaius Licinius Crassus (consul 168 BC), produced the third line of Licinii Crassi of the period, the most famous of whom was Lucius Licinius Crassus, the greatest Roman orator before Cicero and the latter&#x27;s childhood hero and model. Marcus Crassus was also a talented orator and one of the most energetic and active advocates of his time.

==Youth and the First Civil War==
After the Marian purges and the subsequent sudden death of Gaius Marius, the surviving consul Lucius Cornelius Cinna (father-in-law of Julius Caesar) imposed proscriptions on those surviving Roman senators and equestrians who had supported Lucius Cornelius Sulla in his 88 BC march on Rome and overthrow of the traditional Roman political arrangements.

Cinna&#x27;s proscription forced Crassus to flee to Hispania. He stayed in Spain from 87 to 84 BC. Here, he recruited 2,500 men (an understrength legion) from his father&#x27;s clients settled in the area. Crassus used his army to extort money from the local cities to pay for his campaigns, even being accused of sacking Malaca. After Cinna&#x27;s death in 84 BC, Crassus went to the Roman province of Africa and joined Metellus Pius, one of Sulla&#x27;s closest allies, but did not stay there for long because of disagreements with Metellus. He sailed his army to Greece and joined Sulla, &quot;with whom he stood in a position of special honor.&quot; During Sulla&#x27;s civil war, Crassus and Pompey fought a battle in the plain of Spoletium (Spoleto), killed about 3,000 of the men of Papirius Carbo, the leader of the Marian forces, and besieged Carrinas, a Marian commander.

During the decisive Battle of the Colline Gate, Crassus commanded the right flank of Sulla&#x27;s army. After almost a day of fighting, the battle was going poorly for Sulla; his own center was being pushed back and was on the verge of collapse when he got word from Crassus that he had comprehensively crushed the enemy before him. Crassus wanted to know whether Sulla needed assistance, or whether his men could retire. Sulla told him to advance on the enemy&#x27;s center, and used the news of Crassus&#x27; success to stiffen the resolve of his own troops. By the following morning, the battle was over, and the Sullan army emerged victorious, making Sulla the master of Rome. Sulla&#x27;s victory, and Crassus&#x27; contribution to it, put Crassus in a key position. Sulla was as loyal to his allies as he was cruel towards his enemies, and Crassus had been a very loyal ally.

==Rise to power and wealth==

Marcus Licinius Crassus&#x27; next concern was to rebuild the fortunes of his family, which had been confiscated during the Marian-Cinnan proscriptions. Sulla&#x27;s proscriptions, in which the property of his victims was cheaply auctioned off, found one of the greatest acquirers of this type of property in Crassus: indeed, Sulla was especially supportive of this, because he wished to spread the blame as much as possible among those unscrupulous enough to do so. Sulla&#x27;s proscriptions ensured that his survivors would recoup their lost fortunes from the fortunes of wealthy adherents to Gaius Marius or Lucius Cornelius Cinna. Proscriptions meant that their political enemies lost their fortunes and their lives; that their female relatives (notably, widows and widowed daughters) were forbidden to marry, remarry or remain married; and that, in some cases, their families&#x27; hopes of rebuilding their fortunes and political significance were destroyed. Crassus is said to have made part of his money from proscriptions, notably the proscription of one man whose name was not initially on the list of those proscribed but was added by Crassus, who coveted the man&#x27;s fortune. 
Crassus&#x27; wealth is estimated by Pliny at approximately 200 million sesterces. Plutarch, in his &quot;Life of Crassus&quot;, says the wealth of Crassus increased from less than 300 talents at first, to 7,100 talents. This represented 229 tonnes of silver, worth about US$167.4 million at August 2023 silver prices, accounted right before his Parthian expedition, most of which Plutarch declares Crassus got &quot;by fire and war, making the public calamities his greatest source of revenue.&quot;

Some of Crassus&#x27; wealth was acquired conventionally, through slave trafficking, production from silver mines, and speculative real estate purchases. Crassus bought property that was confiscated in proscriptions and by notoriously purchasing burnt and collapsed buildings. Plutarch wrote that, observing how frequent such occurrences were, he bought slaves &quot;who were architects and builders.&quot; When he had over 500 slaves, he bought houses that had burnt and the adjacent ones &quot;because their owners would let go at a trifling price.&quot; He bought &quot;the largest part of Rome&quot; in this way, buying them on the cheap and rebuilding them with slave labor.

The first ever Roman fire brigade was created by Crassus. Fires were almost a daily occurrence in Rome, and Crassus took advantage of the fact that Rome had no fire department, by creating his own brigade—500 men strong—which rushed to burning buildings at the first cry of alarm. Upon arriving at the scene, however, the firefighters did nothing while Crassus offered to buy the burning building from the distressed property owner, at a miserable price. If the owner agreed to sell the property, his men would put out the fire; if the owner refused, then they would simply let the structure burn to the ground. After buying many properties this way, he rebuilt them, and often leased the properties to their original owners or new tenants.

Crassus befriended Licinia, a Vestal Virgin, whose valuable property he coveted. Plutarch says &quot;And yet, when he was further on in years, he was accused of criminal intimacy with Licinia, one of the vestal virgins, and Licinia was formally prosecuted by a certain Plotius. Now, Licinia was the owner of a pleasant villa in the suburbs, which Crassus wished to get at a low price, and it was for this reason that he was forever hovering about the woman and paying his court to her, until he fell under the abominable suspicion. And, in a way, it was his avarice that absolved him from the charge of corrupting the vestal, and he was acquitted by the judges. But he did not let Licinia go until he had acquired her property.&quot;
Despite his great wealth, Crassus is said to have avoided excess and luxury at home. Family meals were simple, and entertaining was generous but not ostentatious; Crassus chose his companions during leisure hours on the basis of personal friendship as well as political utility. Although the Crassi, as noble plebeians, would have displayed ancestral images in their atrium, they did not lay claim to a fictionalized genealogy that presumed divine or legendary ancestors, a practice not uncommon among the Roman nobility. 

After rebuilding his fortune, Crassus&#x27; next concern was his political career. As a wealthy man in Rome, an adherent of Sulla, and a man who hailed from a line of consuls and praetors, Crassus&#x27; political future was apparently assured. His problem was that, despite his military successes, he was eclipsed by his contemporary Pompey the Great. Crassus&#x27; rivalry with Pompey and his envy of Pompey&#x27;s triumph would influence his subsequent career.

==Crassus and Spartacus==
Crassus was elected praetor in 73 BC and pursued the &quot;cursus honorum&quot;.

During the Third Servile War, or Spartacus&#x27; revolt (73–71 BC), Crassus offered to equip, train, and lead new troops at his own expense, after several legions had been defeated and their commanders killed in battle. Crassus was sent into battle against Spartacus by the Senate. At first, he had trouble both in anticipating Spartacus&#x27; moves and in inspiring his army to strengthen their morale. When a segment of his army fled from battle, abandoning their weapons, Crassus revived the ancient practice of decimation – i.e. executing one out of every ten men, with the victims selected by drawing lots. Plutarch reports that &quot;many things horrible and dreadful to see&quot; occurred during the infliction of punishment, which was witnessed by the rest of Crassus&#x27; army. Nevertheless, according to Appian, the troops&#x27; fighting spirit improved dramatically thereafter, since Crassus had demonstrated that &quot;he was more dangerous to them than the enemy.&quot;

Afterwards, when Spartacus retreated to the Bruttium peninsula in the southwest of Italy, Crassus tried to pen up the slave armies by building a ditch and a rampart across the peninsula of Rhegium in Bruttium, &quot;from sea to sea.&quot; Despite this remarkable feat, Spartacus and part of his army still managed to break out. On the night of a heavy snowstorm, they sneaked through Crassus&#x27; lines and made a bridge of dirt and tree branches over the ditch, thus escaping.

Some time later, when the Roman armies led by Pompey and Varro Lucullus were recalled to Italy in support of Crassus, Spartacus decided to fight rather than find himself and his followers trapped between three armies, two of them returning from overseas action. In this last battle, the battle of the Silarius river, Crassus gained a decisive victory, and captured six thousand slaves alive. During the fighting, Spartacus attempted to personally kill Crassus, slaughtering his way toward the general&#x27;s position, but he succeeded only in killing two of the centurions guarding Crassus. Spartacus himself is believed to have been killed in the battle, although his body was never recovered. The six thousand captured slaves were crucified along the Via Appia by Crassus&#x27; orders. At his command, their bodies were not taken down afterwards, but remained rotting along Rome&#x27;s principal route to the south. This was intended as an object lesson to anyone especially slaves who might think of rebelling against Roman citizens and slave-owners.

Crassus effectively ended the Third Servile War in 71 BC. In Plutarch&#x27;s account, Crassus &quot;had written to the Senate that they must summon Lucullus from Thrace and Pompey from Spain, but he was sorry now that he had done so, and was eager to bring the war to an end before those generals came. He knew that the success would be ascribed to the one who came up with assistance, and not to himself.&quot; He decided to attack a splinter group of rebels, and after this, Spartacus withdrew to the mountains. Pompey had arrived from Hispania with his veterans and was sent to provide reinforcements. Crassus hurried to seek the final battle, which he won. Pompey arrived in time to deal with the disorganized and defeated fugitives, writing to the Senate that &quot;indeed, Crassus had conquered the slaves, but that he himself had extirpated the war.&quot; &quot;Crassus, for all his self-approval, did not venture to ask for the major triumph, and it was thought ignoble and mean in him to celebrate even the minor triumph on foot, called the ovation,&quot; nor did he wish to be honored for subduing slaves.

In Plutarch&#x27;s account, Pompey was asked to stand for the consulship. Crassus wanted to become his colleague and asked Pompey for his assistance. As said in the &quot;Life of Crassus&quot;, &quot;Pompey received his request gladly (for he was desirous of having Crassus, in some way or other, always in debt to him for some favor), eagerly promoted his candidature, and finally said in a speech to the assembly that he should be no less grateful to them for the colleague than for the office which he desired.&quot; However, in office, they did not remain friendly. They &quot;differed on almost every measure, and by their contentiousness, rendered their consulship barren politically and without achievement.&quot; Crassus displayed his wealth by realizing public sacrifices to Hercules, entertaining the populace at 10,000 tables and distributing sufficient grain to last each family three months, an act that had the additional ends of performing a previously made religious vow of a tithe to the demigod Hercules and also to gain support among the members of the popular party.

In Appian&#x27;s account, when Crassus ended the rebellion, there was a contention over honors between him and Pompey. Neither men dismissed their armies, with both being candidates for the consulship. Crassus had been praetor as the law of Sulla required. Pompey had been neither praetor nor quaestor, and was only 34 years old, but he had promised the plebeian tribunes to restore much of their power, that had been taken away by Sulla&#x27;s constitutional reforms. Even when they were both chosen consuls, they did not dismiss their armies stationed near the city. Pompey said that he was awaiting the return of Metellus for his Spanish triumph; Crassus said that Pompey ought to dismiss his army first. In the end, Crassus yielded first, offering Pompey his hand.

==First Triumvirate-Alliance with Pompey and Caesar==
In 65 BC, Crassus was elected censor with another conservative, Quintus Lutatius Catulus Capitolinus, himself son of a consul. During that decade, Crassus was Julius Caesar&#x27;s patron in all but name, financing Caesar&#x27;s successful election to become &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;. Caesar had formerly been the priest of Jupiter, or &quot;flamen dialis&quot;, but had been deprived of office by Sulla. Crassus also supported Caesar&#x27;s efforts to win command of military campaigns. Caesar&#x27;s mediation between Crassus and Pompey led to the creation of the First Triumvirate in 60 BC, consisting of Crassus, Pompey, and Caesar (who became consul in 59 BC). This coalition would last until Crassus&#x27; death.
In 54 BC, Crassus looted the Jewish Temple treasury.

In 55 BC, after the Triumvirate met at the Luca Conference in 56 BC, Crassus was again consul with Pompey, and a law was passed assigning the provinces of the two Hispanias and Syria to Pompey and Crassus, respectively, for five years.

==Syrian governorship and death==
Crassus received Syria as his province, which promised to be an inexhaustible source of wealth. It might have been, had he not also sought military glory and crossed the Euphrates in an attempt to conquer Parthia. Crassus attacked Parthia not only because of its great source of riches, but because of a desire to match the military victories of Pompey and Caesar. The king of Armenia, Artavasdes II, offered Crassus the aid of nearly 40,000 troops (10,000 cataphracts and 30,000 infantrymen) on the condition that Crassus invade through Armenia so that the king could not only maintain the upkeep of his own troops but also provide a safer route for his men and Crassus. Crassus refused, and chose the more direct route by crossing the Euphrates, as he had done in his successful campaign in the previous year. Crassus received directions from the Osroene chieftain Ariamnes, who had previously assisted Pompey in his eastern campaigns. Ariamnes was in the pay of the Parthians and urged Crassus to attack at once, falsely stating that the Parthians were weak and unorganized. He then led Crassus&#x27; army into desert, far from any water. In 53BC, at the Battle of Carrhae (modern Harran, in Turkey), Crassus&#x27; legions were defeated by a numerically inferior Parthian force. Crassus&#x27; legions were primarily heavy infantry, and not prepared for an attack by swift mounted archers, a tactic which Parthian troops had mastered. The Parthian horse archers devastated the unprepared Romans with hit-and-run tactics, feigning retreats as they shot to their rear. Crassus refused his quaestor Gaius Cassius Longinus&#x27; plans to reconstitute the Roman battle line, and remained in the testudo formation to protect his flanks until the Parthians eventually ran out of arrows. However, the Parthians brought camels carrying arrows to continuously resupply their archers, letting them relentlessly barrage the Romans until dusk. Despite taking severe casualties, the Romans successfully retreated to Carrhae, forced to leave many wounded behind to be slaughtered by the Parthians.

Subsequently, Crassus&#x27; men, being near mutiny, demanded he parley with the Parthians, who had offered to meet with him. Crassus, despondent at the death of his son Publius in the battle, finally agreed to meet the Parthian general Surena. However, when Crassus mounted a horse to ride to the Parthian camp for a peace negotiation, his junior officer Octavius suspected a Parthian trap and grabbed Crassus&#x27; horse by the bridle, instigating a sudden fight with the Parthians that left all the Romans dead, including Crassus. A story later emerged that, after Crassus&#x27; death, the Parthians poured molten gold into his mouth to mock his thirst for wealth.

Plutarch&#x27;s biography of Crassus also mentions that, during the feasting and revelry in the wedding ceremony of Artavasdes&#x27; sister to the Parthian king Orodes II&#x27;s son and heir Pacorus in the Armenian capital of Artashat, Crassus&#x27; head was brought to Orodes II. Both kings were enjoying a performance of Euripides&#x27; tragedy &quot;The Bacchae&quot; when an actor of the royal court, named Jason of Tralles, took the head and sang these verses:

 Crassus&#x27; head was thus used instead of a prop to represent Pentheus and carried by of Agave.

Also according to Plutarch, Crassus was mocked by dressing up a Roman prisoner, Caius Paccianus, who resembled him, in women&#x27;s clothing, calling him &quot;Crassus&quot; and &quot;imperator&quot;, and leading him in a spectacular show of a final, satirical &quot;triumphal procession&quot;, ridiculing the traditional symbols of Roman triumph and authority.

<doc id="46999" wikidata="Q208465" url="?curid=46999" title="Buffer solution">
<text>A buffer solution is a solution where the pH does not change significantly on dilution or if an acid or base is added at constant temperature. Its pH changes very little when a small amount of strong acid or base is added to it. Buffer solutions are used as a means of keeping pH at a nearly constant value in a wide variety of chemical applications. In nature, there are many living systems that use buffering for pH regulation. For example, the bicarbonate buffering system is used to regulate the pH of blood, and bicarbonate also acts as a buffer in the ocean.

==Principles of buffering==

Buffer solutions resist pH change because of a chemical equilibrium between the weak acid HA and its conjugate base A−:

When some strong acid is added to an equilibrium mixture of the weak acid and its conjugate base, hydrogen ions (H+) are added, and the equilibrium is shifted to the left, in accordance with Le Chatelier&#x27;s principle. Because of this, the hydrogen ion concentration increases by less than the amount expected for the quantity of strong acid added.
Similarly, if strong alkali is added to the mixture, the hydrogen ion concentration decreases by less than the amount expected for the quantity of alkali added. In Figure 1, the effect is illustrated by the simulated titration of a weak acid with p&quot;K&quot;a = 4.7. The relative concentration of undissociated acid is shown in blue, and of its conjugate base in red. The pH changes relatively slowly in the buffer region, pH = p&quot;K&quot;a ± 1, centered at pH = 4.7, where [HA] = [A−]. The hydrogen ion concentration decreases by less than the amount expected because most of the added hydroxide ion is consumed in the reaction

and only a little is consumed in the neutralization reaction (which is the reaction that results in an increase in pH)
Once the acid is more than 95% deprotonated, the pH rises rapidly because most of the added alkali is consumed in the neutralization reaction.

===Buffer capacity===
Buffer capacity is a quantitative measure of the resistance to change of pH of a solution containing a buffering agent with respect to a change of acid or alkali concentration. It can be defined as follows:
formula_1 
where formula_2 is an infinitesimal amount of added base, or
formula_3 
where formula_4 is an infinitesimal amount of added acid. pH is defined as −log10[H+], and &quot;d&quot;(pH) is an infinitesimal change in pH. 

With either definition the buffer capacity for a weak acid HA with dissociation constant &quot;K&quot;a can be expressed as
formula_5
where [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions, and formula_6 is the total concentration of added acid. &quot;K&quot;w is the equilibrium constant for self-ionization of water, equal to 1.0. Note that in solution H+ exists as the hydronium ion H3O+, and further aquation of the hydronium ion has negligible effect on the dissociation equilibrium, except at very high acid concentration. 
This equation shows that there are three regions of raised buffer capacity (see figure 2).
* In the central region of the curve (coloured green on the plot), the second term is dominant, and formula_7 Buffer capacity rises to a local maximum at pH = &quot;pK&quot;a. The height of this peak depends on the value of pKa. Buffer capacity is negligible when the concentration [HA] of buffering agent is very small and increases with increasing concentration of the buffering agent. Some authors show only this region in graphs of buffer capacity. Buffer capacity falls to 33% of the maximum value at pH = p&quot;K&quot;a ± 1, to 10% at pH = p&quot;K&quot;a ± 1.5 and to 1% at pH = p&quot;K&quot;a ± 2. For this reason the most useful range is approximately p&quot;K&quot;a ± 1. When choosing a buffer for use at a specific pH, it should have a p&quot;K&quot;a value as close as possible to that pH. 
* With strongly acidic solutions, pH less than about 2 (coloured red on the plot), the first term in the equation dominates, and buffer capacity rises exponentially with decreasing pH: formula_8 This results from the fact that the second and third terms become negligible at very low pH. This term is independent of the presence or absence of a buffering agent.
* With strongly alkaline solutions, pH more than about 12 (coloured blue on the plot), the third term in the equation dominates, and buffer capacity rises exponentially with increasing pH: formula_9 This results from the fact that the first and second terms become negligible at very high pH. This term is also independent of the presence or absence of a buffering agent.

==Applications of buffers==
The pH of a solution containing a buffering agent can only vary within a narrow range, regardless of what else may be present in the solution. In biological systems this is an essential condition for enzymes to function correctly. For example, in human blood a mixture of carbonic acid (HCO) and bicarbonate (HCO) is present in the plasma fraction; this constitutes the major mechanism for maintaining the pH of blood between 7.35 and 7.45. Outside this narrow range (7.40 ± 0.05 pH unit), acidosis and alkalosis metabolic conditions rapidly develop, ultimately leading to death if the correct buffering capacity is not rapidly restored. 

If the pH value of a solution rises or falls too much, the effectiveness of an enzyme decreases in a process, known as denaturation, which is usually irreversible. The majority of biological samples that are used in research are kept in a buffer solution, often phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4.

In industry, buffering agents are used in fermentation processes and in setting the correct conditions for dyes used in colouring fabrics. They are also used in chemical analysis and calibration of pH meters.

===Simple buffering agents===
For buffers in acid regions, the pH may be adjusted to a desired value by adding a strong acid such as hydrochloric acid to the particular buffering agent. For alkaline buffers, a strong base such as sodium hydroxide may be added. Alternatively, a buffer mixture can be made from a mixture of an acid and its conjugate base. For example, an acetate buffer can be made from a mixture of acetic acid and sodium acetate. Similarly, an alkaline buffer can be made from a mixture of the base and its conjugate acid.

===&quot;Universal&quot; buffer mixtures===
By combining substances with p&quot;K&quot;a values differing by only two or less and adjusting the pH, a wide range of buffers can be obtained. Citric acid is a useful component of a buffer mixture because it has three p&quot;K&quot;a values, separated by less than two. The buffer range can be extended by adding other buffering agents. The following mixtures (McIlvaine&#x27;s buffer solutions) have a buffer range of pH 3 to 8.

A mixture containing citric acid, monopotassium phosphate, boric acid, and diethyl barbituric acid can be made to cover the pH range 2.6 to 12.

Other universal buffers are the Carmody buffer and the Britton–Robinson buffer, developed in 1931.

===Common buffer compounds used in biology===
For effective range see Buffer capacity, above. Also see Good&#x27;s buffers for the historic design principles and favourable properties of these buffer substances in biochemical applications. 

== Calculating buffer pH ==

=== Monoprotic acids===

First write down the equilibrium expression

This shows that when the acid dissociates, equal amounts of hydrogen ion and anion are produced. The equilibrium concentrations of these three components can be calculated in an ICE table (ICE standing for &quot;initial, change, equilibrium&quot;).
The first row, labelled I, lists the initial conditions: the concentration of acid is &quot;C&quot;0, initially undissociated, so the concentrations of A− and H+ would be zero; &quot;y&quot; is the initial concentration of &quot;added&quot; strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid. If strong alkali, such as sodium hydroxide, is added, then &quot;y&quot; will have a negative sign because alkali removes hydrogen ions from the solution. The second row, labelled C for &quot;change&quot;, specifies the changes that occur when the acid dissociates. The acid concentration decreases by an amount −&quot;x&quot;, and the concentrations of A− and H+ both increase by an amount +&quot;x&quot;. This follows from the equilibrium expression. The third row, labelled E for &quot;equilibrium&quot;, adds together the first two rows and shows the concentrations at equilibrium.

To find &quot;x&quot;, use the formula for the equilibrium constant in terms of concentrations:
formula_10

Substitute the concentrations with the values found in the last row of the ICE table:
formula_11

Simplify to formula_12

With specific values for &quot;C&quot;0, &quot;K&quot;a and &quot;y&quot;, this equation can be solved for &quot;x&quot;. Assuming that pH = −log10[H+], the pH can be calculated as pH = −log10(&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot;).

===Polyprotic acids===
Polyprotic acids are acids that can lose more than one proton. The constant for dissociation of the first proton may be denoted as &quot;K&quot;a1, and the constants for dissociation of successive protons as &quot;K&quot;a2, etc. Citric acid is an example of a polyprotic acid H3A, as it can lose three protons.

When the difference between successive p&quot;K&quot;a values is less than about 3, there is overlap between the pH range of existence of the species in equilibrium. The smaller the difference, the more the overlap. In the case of citric acid, the overlap is extensive and solutions of citric acid are buffered over the whole range of pH 2.5 to 7.5.

Calculation of the pH with a polyprotic acid requires a speciation calculation to be performed. In the case of citric acid, this entails the solution of the two equations of mass balance:

formula_13

&quot;C&quot;A is the analytical concentration of the acid, &quot;C&quot;H is the analytical concentration of added hydrogen ions, &quot;βq&quot; are the cumulative association constants. &quot;K&quot;w is the constant for self-ionization of water. There are two non-linear simultaneous equations in two unknown quantities [A3−] and [H+]. Many computer programs are available to do this calculation. The speciation diagram for citric acid was produced with the program HySS.

N.B. The numbering of cumulative, overall constants is the reverse of the numbering of the stepwise, dissociation constants.
Cumulative association constants are used in general-purpose computer programs such as the one used to obtain the speciation diagram above.

<text>A colocation centre (also spelled co-location, or shortened to colo) or &quot;carrier hotel&quot;, is a type of data centre where equipment, space, and bandwidth are available for rental to retail customers. Colocation facilities provide space, power, cooling, and physical security for the server, storage, and networking equipment of other firms and also connect them to a variety of telecommunications and network service providers with a minimum of cost and complexity.

==Configuration==
Many colocation providers sell to a wide range of customers, ranging from large enterprises to small companies. Typically, the customer owns the information technology (IT) equipment and the facility provides power and cooling. Customers retain control over the design and usage of their equipment, but daily management of the data centre and facility are overseen by the multi-tenant colocation provider.

* Cabinets – A cabinet is a locking unit that holds a server rack. In a multi-tenant data centre, servers within cabinets share raised-floor space with other tenants, in addition to sharing power and cooling infrastructure.
* Cages – A cage is dedicated server space within a traditional raised-floor data centre; it is surrounded by mesh walls and entered through a locking door. Cages share power and cooling infrastructure with other data centre tenants.
* Suites – A suite is a dedicated, private server space within a traditional raised-floor data centre; it is fully enclosed by solid partitions and entered through a locking door. Suites may share power and cooling infrastructure with other data center tenants, or have these resources provided on a dedicated basis.
* Modules – data center modules are purpose-engineered modules and components to offer scalable data center capacity. They typically use standardized components, which make them easily added, integrated or retrofitted into existing data centers, and cheaper and easier to build. In a colocation environment, the data center module is a data center within a data center, with its own steel walls and security protocol, and its own cooling and power infrastructure. &quot;A number of colocation companies have praised the modular approach to data centers to better match customer demand with physical build outs, and allow customers to buy a data center as a service, paying only for what they consume.&quot;

==Building features==
Buildings with data centres inside them are often easy to recognize by the amount of cooling equipment located outside or on the roof.

Colocation facilities have many other special characteristics:
* Fire protection systems, including passive and active elements, as well as implementation of fire prevention programmes in operations. Smoke detectors are usually installed to provide early warning of a developing fire by detecting particles generated by smouldering components prior to the development of flame. This allows investigation, interruption of power, and manual fire suppression using hand held fire extinguishers before the fire grows to a large size. A fire sprinkler system is often provided to control a full scale fire if it develops. Clean agent fire suppression gaseous systems are sometimes installed to suppress a fire earlier than the fire sprinkler system. Passive fire protection elements include the installation of fire walls around the space, so a fire can be restricted to a portion of the facility for a limited time in the event of the failure of the active fire protection systems, or if they are not installed.
* 19-inch racks for data equipment and servers, 23-inch racks for telecommunications equipment
* Cabinets and cages for physical access control over tenants&#x27; equipment. Depending on one&#x27;s needs a cabinet can house individual or multiple racks.
* Overhead or underfloor cable rack (tray) and fibreguide, power cables usually on separate rack from data
* Air conditioning is used to control the temperature and humidity in the space. ASHRAE recommends a temperature range and humidity range for optimal electronic equipment conditions versus environmental issues. The electrical power used by the electronic equipment is converted to heat, which is rejected to the ambient air in the data centre space. Unless the heat is removed, the ambient temperature will rise, resulting in electronic equipment malfunction. By controlling the space air temperature, the server components at the board level are kept within the manufacturer&#x27;s specified temperature and humidity range. Air conditioning systems help keep equipment space humidity within acceptable parameters by cooling the return space air below the dew point. Too much humidity and water may begin to condense on internal components. In case of a dry atmosphere, ancillary humidification systems may add water vapour to the space if the humidity is too low, to avoid static electricity discharge problems which may damage components.
* Low-impedance electrical ground
* Few, if any, windows

Colocation data centres are often audited to prove that they attain certain standards and levels of reliability; the most commonly seen systems are SSAE 16 SOC 1 Type I and Type II (formerly SAS 70 Type I and Type II) and the tier system by the Uptime Institute or TIA. For service organizations today, SSAE 16 calls for a description of its &quot;system&quot;. This is far more detailed and comprehensive than SAS 70&#x27;s description of &quot;controls&quot;. Other data center compliance standards include Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) audit and PCI DSS Standards.

==Power==
Colocation facilities generally have generators that start automatically when utility power fails, usually running on diesel fuel. These generators may have varying levels of redundancy, depending on how the facility is built. Generators do not start instantaneously, so colocation facilities usually have battery backup systems. In many facilities, the operator of the facility provides large inverters to provide AC power from the batteries. In other cases, customers may install smaller UPSes in their racks.

Some customers choose to use equipment that is powered directly by 48 VDC (nominal) battery banks. This may provide better energy efficiency, and may reduce the number of parts that can fail, though the reduced voltage greatly increases necessary current, and thus the size (and cost) of power delivery wiring. An alternative to batteries is a motor–generator connected to a flywheel and diesel engine.

Many colocation facilities can provide redundant, A and B power feeds to customer equipment, and high end servers and telecommunications equipment often can have two power supplies installed.

Colocation facilities are sometimes connected to multiple sections of the utility power grid for additional reliability.

==Internal connections==
Colocation facility owners have differing rules regarding cross-connects between their customers, some of whom may be carriers. These rules may allow customers to run such connections at no charge, or allow customers to order such connections for a monthly fee. They may allow customers to order cross-connects to carriers, but not to other customers. Some colocation centres feature a &quot;meet-me-room&quot; where the different carriers housed in the centre can efficiently exchange data.

Most peering points sit in colocation centres and because of the high concentration of servers inside larger colocation centres, most carriers will be interested in bringing direct connections to such buildings. In many cases, there will be a larger Internet exchange point hosted inside a colocation centre, where customers can connect for peering.

<doc id="47004" wikidata="Q138153" url="?curid=47004" title="Colo (gorilla)">
<text>Colo (December 22, 1956 – January 17, 2017) was a western gorilla widely known as the first gorilla to be born in captivity anywhere in the world and the oldest known gorilla in the world in 2017. Colo was born at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium to Millie Christina (mother) and Baron Macombo (father), and lived there for her entire life. She was briefly called &quot;Cuddles&quot; before a contest was held to officially name her. (Mrs. Howard Brannon of Zanesville, Ohio, won the contest.) Colo&#x27;s name was derived from the place of her birth, Columbus, Ohio.

==Life==

The Columbus Zoo first introduced gorillas in 1951. It was in 1956 that two gorillas first produced offspring in the zoo. The gorilla was named Colo, short for Columbus.
After she was rejected at birth by her mother, zookeepers had to hand-raise Colo. They hand-raised her much like a human child, by dressing her in clothes and giving her bottles of formula. At the age of two years, Colo was introduced to a 19-month-old male from Africa called Bongo. Colo and Bongo had three offspring; Emmy on February 1, 1968, Oscar on July 18, 1969, and Toni on December 28, 1971.

On April 25, 1979, Columbus Zoo had its first third generation birth. The infant was named Cora, short for Central Ohio Rare Ape. On January 27, 1997, Colo&#x27;s great-grandson Jantu was born. A birth at the Henry Doorly Zoo made Colo a great-great-grandmother in 2003. Although Colo did not raise any of her own offspring, she reared her twin grandsons, Macombo II and Mosuba, from birth. Colo also acted as a guardian for her grandson, named J.J. after &quot;Jungle&quot; Jack Hanna with whom he shares a birthday.

Colo was held at the Columbus Zoo and has been there longer than any other animal in the zoo&#x27;s captive animal collection. Colo and her progeny, five of whom are still held at the Columbus Zoo, comprised about one-third of the Zoo&#x27;s 17 captive gorillas as of 2015.

Colo became the oldest living gorilla in captivity following the death of 55-year-old Jenny in September 2008. Colo celebrated her 60th birthday on December 22, 2016. The Columbus Zoo announced that Colo died in her sleep on January 17, 2017.

==Genealogy==
Colo was a mother to three, a grandmother to 16, a great-grandmother to 12, and a great-great-grandmother to three.

<text>A telecommunications company is a kind of electronic communications service provider, more precisely a telecommunications service provider (TSP), that provides telecommunications services such as telephony and data communications access. Many traditional solely telephone companies now function as internet service providers (ISPs), and the distinction between a telephone company and ISP has tended to disappear completely over time, as the current trend for supplier convergence in the industry develops. Additionally, with advances in technology development, other traditional separate industries such as cable television, Voice-over IP (VoIP), and satellite providers offer similar competing features as the telephone companies to both residential and businesses leading to further evolution of corporate identity have taken shape.

Due to the nature of capital expenditure involved in the past, most telecommunications companies were government owned agencies or privately-owned monopolies operated in most countries under close state-regulations. But today there are many private players in most regions of the world, and even most of the government owned companies have been opened up to competition in-line with World Trade Organization (WTO) policy agenda. Historically these government agencies were often referred to, primarily in Europe, as PTTs (postal, telegraph and telephone services). Telecommunications companies are common carriers, and in the United States are also known as local exchange carriers. With the advent of mobile telephony, telecommunications companies now include wireless carriers, or mobile network operators and even satellite providers (Iridium).

Over time software companies have also evolved to provide telephone services over the Internet.

==History==
In 1913, the Kingsbury Commitment allowed more than 20,000 independent telecommunications companies in the United States to use the long distance trunks of Bell Telephone Company.

==Popular culture==
* Comedian Lily Tomlin frequently satirized the telephone industry (and the country&#x27;s then-dominant Bell System in particular) with a skit playing the telephone operator Ernestine. Ernestine, who became one of Tomlin&#x27;s trademark characters, was perhaps most famous for the following line: &quot;We don&#x27;t care; we don&#x27;t have to. We&#x27;re the phone company.&quot;
* In the satirical 1967 film &quot;The President&#x27;s Analyst&quot;, The Phone Company (TPC) is depicted as plotting to enslave humanity by replacing landlines with brain-implanted mobile phones.
* In the 1988 video game &quot;Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders&quot;, The Phone Company (TPC) was used by the Caponian aliens to secretly reduce the intelligence of humans.

<text>The Elfstedentocht (; West Frisian: &quot;Alvestêdetocht&quot; , English: &quot;Eleven cities tour&quot;) is a long-distance tour skating event on natural ice, almost long, which is held both as a speed skating competition (with 300 contestants) and a leisure tour (with 16,000 skaters). The &quot;Elfstedentocht&quot; is the biggest ice-skating tour in the world.

The tour is held in the province of Friesland in the north of the Netherlands, leading past all eleven historical cities of the province. The tour is held at most once a year, only when the natural ice along the entire course is at least thick; sometimes on consecutive years, other times with gaps that may exceed 20 years. When the ice is suitable, the tour is announced and starts within 48 hours.

The Elfstedentocht has been declared to be in danger of &quot;extinction&quot; due to climate change. In the past 50 years, the &quot;Elfstedentocht&quot; has taken place only three times, most recently in 1997.

==Course and rules==
The tour, almost 200 km (125 miles) in length, follows a closed or circular route along frozen canals, rivers and lakes visiting the eleven historic Frisian cities: Leeuwarden, Sneek, IJlst, Sloten, Stavoren, Hindeloopen, Workum, Bolsward, Harlingen, Franeker, Dokkum, then returning to Leeuwarden. The tour is held only if the ice is, and remains, at least 15 centimetres (6&quot;) thick along the entire course as about 15,000 amateur skaters take part, putting high requirements on the quality of the ice. The last tours were held in 1985, 1986 and 1997. All skaters must be members of the Association of the Eleven Frisian Towns. A starting permit and bib is required (€100 in 2017). Skaters must collect a stamp in each city, and at three secret check points, and must finish the course before midnight.

There are often points along the route where the ice is too thin to allow mass skating; they are called &quot;kluning points&quot; (from West Frisian klúnje meaning to run on skates over a carpet), and the skaters walk on their skates to the next stretch of good ice. In 1997 ice-transplantation was re-introduced to strengthen weak places in the ice, for instance under bridges.

The finishing point of the &quot;Elfstedentocht&quot; is a canal near Leeuwarden, called the &quot;Bonkevaart&quot;, close to the landmark windmill, &quot;De Bullemolen&quot;, Lekkum.
===Route table===
==Planning and publicity==
Since the &quot;Elfstedentocht&quot; is such a rare event, its declaration creates excitement all over the country. In the build-up to a possible race in 2012, Mark Rutte, the Dutch Prime Minister remarked &quot;once every fifteen years our country is not governed from The Hague but by twenty-two district heads in Friesland. And our country is in good hands.&quot; As soon as a few days pass with below-freezing temperatures, the media start speculating about the chances for an &quot;Elfstedentocht&quot;. The longer the freezing temperatures stay, the more intense this &quot;Elfstedenkoorts&quot; (eleven cities fever) gets, culminating in a national near-frenzy when it is announced that the tour will actually be held. The day before the tour many Dutch flock to Leeuwarden to enjoy the party atmosphere that surrounds the event; that evening, called the &quot;Nacht van Leeuwarden&quot; (Night of Leeuwarden), becomes a giant street party (Frisians, who have a reputation for surliness, are said to thaw when it freezes).

On the day of the tour many Dutch either stay at home to watch it on television (9.2 million viewers by one estimate), or find a place along the route to cheer the skaters on, either taking the day off or calling in sick for work. In February 2012, Friesland hotels were fully booked and expecting between 1.5 and 2 million visitors in anticipation of a tour before it was announced, as the weather seemed suitable.

== History ==

There has been mention of skaters visiting all eleven cities of Friesland on one day since 1760. The &quot;Elfstedentocht&quot; was already part of Frisian tradition when, in 1890, Pim Mulier conceived the idea of an organised tour, which was first held in 1909 when 22 men competed. After this race, the &quot;Vereniging De Friesche Elf Steden&quot;(nl) (Association of the Eleven Frisian Towns) was established to organise the tours.

In the 1912 edition Jikke Gaastra was the first woman ever who finished the &quot;Elfstedentocht&quot;, but could not complete the full tour because the ice was not good enough after Sneek. In the 1917 edition Janna van der Weg was the first woman who finished the tour.

The winters of 1939/40, 1940/41 and 1941/42 were particularly severe, with the race being run in each of them. The 1940 race, run three months prior to the German invasion of the Netherlands, saw over 3,000 competitors start at 05:00 on 30 January, with the first five finishing at 16:34. The event dominated the front pages of Dutch newspapers.

The &quot;Elfstedentocht&quot; of 1963 became known as &quot;The hell of &#x27;63&quot; when only 69 of the 10,000 participants were able to finish the race, due to the extremely low temperatures of -18 °C (0°F), powder snow and a harsh eastern wind. Conditions were so horrendous that the 1963 winner, Reinier Paping, became a national hero, and the tour itself legendary. Paping could not make out the finishing line as he was snow blind by the end of the race, and many of the contestants had frostbite, broken limbs, and damaged eyes.

The next &quot;Elfstedentocht&quot; after 1963 was held in 1985; times had changed. Before, one of the best methods to stay warm during the tour was to wear newspapers underneath the clothes. In the 20 years between the tours of 1963 and 1985, clothing, training methods and skates became much more advanced, changing the nature of skating.

The tour of 1985 was terminated prematurely because of thawing; as early as 22:00 in the evening skaters were taken off the ice. In 1986 the current Dutch King (at the time still Crown Prince) Willem-Alexander completed the &quot;Elfstedentocht&quot; under the name &quot;W.A. van Buren&quot;, &quot;Van Buren&quot; being a traditional pseudonym of the Royal House. In 1997 Piet Kleine, who had previously won a gold medal at the Olympics for speed skating was disqualified because he missed getting a stamp at Hindeloopen despite video evidence that he had been there.

=== &quot;Elfstedentocht&quot; 2012 – the race that did not happen ===
The ten-day cold spell in late January and early February 2012, the 33rd such occurrence since 1901 when temperatures as low as -22.9 °C (-9.2°F) were recorded in Lelystad, heightened the expectation of a 2012 Elfstedentocht – the expected day of the event, had it taken place, was Saturday 11 February.

On 2 February 2012, it was reported that 95% of various locks that controlled the water flow in the canals had been adjusted to maximise the ice thickness. On the same day, the Dutch meteorological institute forecast that temperatures would not rise above freezing until Wednesday 8 February at the earliest and that the thickness of the ice would be 15 cm (6&quot;) from Tuesday 7 February until Saturday 11 February. On 3 February, the Dutch meteorological institute forecast a probable ice-thickness of 20 cm (8&quot;) on Saturday 11 February and on 5 February they forecast an ice thickness approaching 25 cm (10&quot;).

On 6 February it was announced that the committee had met the previous evening for the first time in fifteen years. Although there were areas where the ice was not thick enough for the race to be held, the forecast for continuing freezing weather meant that they were optimistic that the race would be held. A press conference was held at 09:30 CET and the committee was due to meet again on 8 February. At the press conference, it was stated that in north Friesland the ice conditions were suitable to hold the race. In south west Friesland, the conditions were not so good, Stavoren being a particular problem where the ice was only 2 cm (1&quot;) thick in places.

On 6 February a prohibition order on navigation on many of the canals in Friesland was extended in order to facilitate the growth of the ice. The following day the Dutch meteorological institute forecast that the cold spell would break on Sunday 12 February or Monday 13 February with the temperature rising above freezing point.

Late afternoon on the 8 February Wiebe Wieling, chairman of the organising committee, said that the race was off – the committee had to be realistic – safety issues had made the race impossible. A ten-day cold spell was insufficient for the event; the 1997 event had taken place at the end of a 12-day cold spell.

=== Winners ===
The time taken for the winner to complete the course is given in hours and minutes. Although temperatures were sometimes above freezing on the day of the tour, all tours were preceded by many days of below-freezing temperatures.
Women were first allowed to take part in the tour proper in 1985; before then they had to skate with the amateurs and no award was given. The women to cross the finish line first were:

* 1940 – Sjoerdtsje Faber
* 1941 – Wopkje Kooistra
* 1942 – Antje Schaap
* 1985 – Lenie van der Hoorn
* 1986 – Tineke Dijkshoorn
* 1997 – Klasina Seinstra (7:49.11)

The course can vary slightly from race to race, depending on the quality of the ice. The cumulative distance at each checkpoint in 1997 was:

*0 km: Leeuwarden
*22 km: Sneek (municipality Súdwest-Fryslân)
*26 km: IJlst (mun. Súdwest-Fryslân)
*40 km: Sloten (mun. De Fryske Marren)
*66 km: Stavoren (mun. Súdwest-Fryslân)
*77 km: Hindeloopen (mun. Súdwest-Fryslân)
*86 km: Workum (mun. Súdwest-Fryslân)
*99 km: Bolsward (mun. Súdwest-Fryslân)
*116 km: Harlingen
*129 km: Franeker (mun. Waadhoeke)
*174 km: Dokkum (mun. Noardeast-Fryslân)
*199 km: Leeuwarden

=== Alternative Elfstedentocht ===
An &quot;alternative Elfstedentocht&quot; has been held every year in January since 1989 on the Weissensee in Carinthia, Austria.

The 930 mAA (3051 ft) lake is 12 km long (7 miles) and around 3000 speed skaters do either the 50, 100 or 200 km (30, 60 or 125 mile) course at what is likely to be the world&#x27;s largest ice sport event.

The Dutch Speed Skating Championship is part of the event and the fastest competitors do the 200 kilometre (125 mile) course in just over five hours.

=== Fietselfstedentocht (Eleven towns by bicycle) ===
The eleven towns cycle race was first held in 1912 and developed in parallel with its skating counterpart, but unlike the skating race, has taken place on almost every year - apart from the 2001 event which was cancelled due to foot and mouth disease and the 2020 event which was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it has taken place on Whit Monday every year since 1947. The event has become immensely popular and as a safety precaution it ceased to be a race but has become a tour with a maximum average speed of 25 km/h (15 mph) between checkpoints.

The tour, which starts and ends in Bolsward rather than Leeuwarden, is currently limited to 15,000 entrants. Between 05:00 and 08:00, entrants leave Bolsward every eight minutes in batches of about 600 and those who complete the 235 km (146 mile) course before midnight receive medals.

In 2013 the organisers banned velomobiles from the event by limiting the event to two-wheeled vehicles propelled by human power.

=== Zwemelfstedentocht ===
In 2018, Dutch long-distance swimmer Maarten van der Weijden attempted to swim the entire eleven city tour. This attempt ended due to poor swimming conditions and illness from &quot;E. coli&quot;. The following summer he successfully completed the route, arriving at the finish in Leeuwarden on June 24, 2019. His effort raised over €6.1 million for cancer research.

=== Elfstedentriathlon ===
The Eleven Cities Triathlon was completed for the first time by Frisian triathlete Stefan van der Pal in 2020. Within a week he swam 200 kilometres (125 miles) (five days), then cycled the trip (7 hours) and then ran the route again (32.5 hours). He raised €96000 for a foundation that is committed to research into brain stem cancer in children.

Between June 18th and 25th 2023, Maarten van der Weijden completed the Eleven Cities Triathlon. He raised over 3 million euro for cancer research. Unlike van der Pal, who ran, van der Weijden walked the last part.

<doc id="47011" wikidata="Q507505" url="?curid=47011" title="Arrhenius equation">
<text>In physical chemistry, the Arrhenius equation is a formula for the temperature dependence of reaction rates. The equation was proposed by Svante Arrhenius in 1889, based on the work of Dutch chemist Jacobus Henricus van &#x27;t Hoff who had noted in 1884 that the Van &#x27;t Hoff equation for the temperature dependence of equilibrium constants suggests such a formula for the rates of both forward and reverse reactions. This equation has a vast and important application in determining the rate of chemical reactions and for calculation of energy of activation. Arrhenius provided a physical justification and interpretation for the formula. Currently, it is best seen as an empirical relationship. It can be used to model the temperature variation of diffusion coefficients, population of crystal vacancies, creep rates, and many other thermally induced processes and reactions. The Eyring equation, developed in 1935, also expresses the relationship between rate and energy.

== Formulation ==
The Arrhenius equation describes the exponential dependence of the rate constant of a chemical reaction on the absolute temperature as
formula_1
where
* is the rate constant (frequency of collisions resulting in a reaction),
* is the absolute temperature,
* is the pre-exponential factor or Arrhenius factor or frequency factor. Arrhenius originally considered A to be a temperature-independent constant for each chemical reaction. However more recent treatments include some temperature dependence – see &quot;&quot; below.
* is the molar activation energy for the reaction,
* is the universal gas constant.

Alternatively, the equation may be expressed as
formula_2
where
* is the activation energy for the reaction (in the same unit as &quot;k&quot;B&quot;T&quot;),
* is the Boltzmann constant.

The only difference is the unit of : the former form uses energy per mole, which is common in chemistry, while the latter form uses energy per molecule directly, which is common in physics.
The different units are accounted for in using either the gas constant, , or the Boltzmann constant, , as the multiplier of temperature .

The unit of the pre-exponential factor are identical to those of the rate constant and will vary depending on the order of the reaction. If the reaction is first order it has the unit s−1, and for that reason it is often called the &quot;frequency factor&quot; or &quot;attempt frequency&quot; of the reaction. Most simply, is the number of collisions that result in a reaction per second, is the number of collisions (leading to a reaction or not) per second occurring with the proper orientation to react and formula_3 is the probability that any given collision will result in a reaction. It can be seen that either increasing the temperature or decreasing the activation energy (for example through the use of catalysts) will result in an increase in rate of reaction.

Given the small temperature range of kinetic studies, it is reasonable to approximate the activation energy as being independent of the temperature. Similarly, under a wide range of practical conditions, the weak temperature dependence of the pre-exponential factor is negligible compared to the temperature dependence of the factor ; except in the case of &quot;barrierless&quot; diffusion-limited reactions, in which case the pre-exponential factor is dominant and is directly observable.

With this equation it can be roughly estimated that the rate of reaction increases by a factor of about 2 to 3 for every 10 °C rise in temperature, for common values of activation energy and temperature range.

The formula_4 factor denotes the fraction of molecules with energy greater than or equal to formula_5.

== Derivation ==
Van&#x27;t Hoff argued that the temperature formula_6 of a reaction and the standard equilibrium constant formula_7 exhibit the relation:

where formula_8 denotes the apposite standard internal energy change value.

Let formula_9 and formula_10 respectively denote the forward and backward reaction rates of the reaction of interest, then
, an equation from which formula_11 naturally follows.

Substituting the expression for formula_12 in eq.(), we obtain .

The preceding equation can be broken down into the following two equations:
{dT} = \text{constant} + \frac{E_\text{f}}{RT^2}&lt;/math&gt;|}}
and 
{dT} = \text{constant} + \frac{E_\text{b}}{RT^2}&lt;/math&gt;|}}
where formula_13 and formula_14 are the activation energies associated with the forward and backward reactions respectively, with formula_15.

Experimental findings suggest that the constants in eq.() and eq.() can be treated as being equal to zero, so that {dT} = \frac{E_\text{f}}{RT^2}&lt;/math&gt;|}} and {dT} = \frac{E_\text{b}}{RT^2}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

Integrating these equations and taking the exponential yields the results and , where each pre-exponential factor formula_16 or formula_17 is mathematically the exponential of the constant of integration for the respective indefinite integral in question.

== Arrhenius plot ==

Taking the natural logarithm of Arrhenius equation yields:
formula_18

Rearranging yields:
formula_19

This has the same form as an equation for a straight line:
formula_20
where &quot;x&quot; is the reciprocal of &quot;T&quot;.

So, when a reaction has a rate constant obeying the Arrhenius equation, a plot of ln &quot;k&quot; versus &quot;T&quot;−1 gives a straight line, whose slope and intercept can be used to determine &quot;E&quot;a and &quot;A&quot; respectively. This procedure is common in experimental chemical kinetics. The activation energy is simply obtained by multiplying by (−&quot;R&quot;) the slope of the straight line drawn from a plot of ln &quot;k&quot; versus (1/&quot;T&quot;):
formula_21

== Modified Arrhenius equation ==
The modified Arrhenius equation makes explicit the temperature dependence of the pre-exponential factor. The modified equation is usually of the form
formula_22

The original Arrhenius expression above corresponds to . Fitted rate constants typically lie in the range . Theoretical analyses yield various predictions for &quot;n&quot;. It has been pointed out that &quot;it is not feasible to establish, on the basis of temperature studies of the rate constant, whether the predicted &quot;T&quot;1/2 dependence of the pre-exponential factor is observed experimentally&quot;. However, if additional evidence is available, from theory and/or from experiment (such as density dependence), there is no obstacle to incisive tests of the Arrhenius law.

Another common modification is the stretched exponential form
formula_23
where &quot;β&quot; is a dimensionless number of order 1. This is typically regarded as a purely empirical correction or &quot;fudge factor&quot; to make the model fit the data, but can have theoretical meaning, for example showing the presence of a range of activation energies or in special cases like the Mott variable range hopping.

== Theoretical interpretation ==

=== Arrhenius&#x27;s concept of activation energy ===
Arrhenius argued that for reactants to transform into products, they must first acquire a minimum amount of energy, called the activation energy &quot;E&quot;a. At an absolute temperature &quot;T&quot;, the fraction of molecules that have a kinetic energy greater than &quot;E&quot;a can be calculated from statistical mechanics. The concept of &quot;activation energy&quot; explains the exponential nature of the relationship, and in one way or another, it is present in all kinetic theories.

The calculations for reaction rate constants involve an energy averaging over a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution with formula_24 as lower bound and so are often of the type of incomplete gamma functions, which turn out to be proportional to formula_25.

One approach is the collision theory of chemical reactions, developed by Max Trautz and William Lewis in the years 1916–18. In this theory, molecules are supposed to react if they collide with a relative kinetic energy along their line of centers that exceeds &quot;E&quot;a. The number of binary collisions between two unlike molecules per second per unit volume is found to be
formula_26
where &quot;NA&quot; is the Avogadro constant, &quot;dAB&quot; is the average diameter of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, &quot;T&quot; is the temperature which is multiplied by the Boltzmann constant &quot;k&quot;B to convert to energy, and &quot;μAB&quot; is the reduced mass.

The rate constant is then calculated as , so that the collision theory predicts that the pre-exponential factor is equal to the collision number &quot;zAB&quot;. However for many reactions this agrees poorly with experiment, so the rate constant is written instead as . Here &quot;formula_27&quot; is an empirical steric factor, often much less than 1.00, which is interpreted as the fraction of sufficiently energetic collisions in which the two molecules have the correct mutual orientation to react.

=== Transition state theory ===
The Eyring equation, another Arrhenius-like expression, appears in the &quot;transition state theory&quot; of chemical reactions, formulated by Eugene Wigner, Henry Eyring, Michael Polanyi and M. G. Evans in the 1930s. The Eyring equation can be written:
formula_28
where formula_29 is the Gibbs energy of activation, formula_30 is the entropy of activation, formula_31 is the enthalpy of activation, formula_32 is the Boltzmann constant, and formula_33 is the Planck constant.

At first sight this looks like an exponential multiplied by a factor that is &quot;linear&quot; in temperature. However, free energy is itself a temperature dependent quantity. The free energy of activation formula_34 is the difference of an enthalpy term and an entropy term multiplied by the absolute temperature. The pre-exponential factor depends primarily on the entropy of activation. The overall expression again takes the form of an Arrhenius exponential (of enthalpy rather than energy) multiplied by a slowly varying function of &quot;T&quot;. The precise form of the temperature dependence depends upon the reaction, and can be calculated using formulas from statistical mechanics involving the partition functions of the reactants and of the activated complex.

=== Limitations of the idea of Arrhenius activation energy ===
Both the Arrhenius activation energy and the rate constant &quot;k&quot; are experimentally determined, and represent macroscopic reaction-specific parameters that are not simply related to threshold energies and the success of individual collisions at the molecular level. Consider a particular collision (an elementary reaction) between molecules A and B. The collision angle, the relative translational energy, the internal (particularly vibrational) energy will all determine the chance that the collision will produce a product molecule AB. Macroscopic measurements of &quot;E&quot; and &quot;k&quot; are the result of many individual collisions with differing collision parameters. To probe reaction rates at molecular level, experiments are conducted under near-collisional conditions and this subject is often called molecular reaction dynamics.

Another situation where the explanation of the Arrhenius equation parameters falls short is in heterogeneous catalysis, especially for reactions that show Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics. Clearly, molecules on surfaces do not &quot;collide&quot; directly, and a simple molecular cross-section does not apply here. Instead, the pre-exponential factor reflects the travel across the surface towards the active site.

There are deviations from the Arrhenius law during the glass transition in all classes of glass-forming matter. The Arrhenius law predicts that the motion of the structural units (atoms, molecules, ions, etc.) should slow down at a slower rate through the glass transition than is experimentally observed. In other words, the structural units slow down at a faster rate than is predicted by the Arrhenius law. This observation is made reasonable assuming that the units must overcome an energy barrier by means of a thermal activation energy. The thermal energy must be high enough to allow for translational motion of the units which leads to viscous flow of the material.

<text>In computer networking, peering is a voluntary interconnection of administratively separate Internet networks for the purpose of exchanging traffic between the &quot;down-stream&quot; users of each network. Peering is settlement-free, also known as &quot;bill-and-keep&quot; or &quot;sender keeps all&quot;, meaning that neither party pays the other in association with the exchange of traffic; instead, each derives and retains revenue from its own customers.

An agreement by two or more networks to peer is instantiated by a physical interconnection of the networks, an exchange of routing information through the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing protocol, tacit agreement to norms of conduct and, in some extraordinarily rare cases (0.07%), a formalized contractual document.

In 0.02% of cases the word &quot;peering&quot; is used to describe situations where there is some settlement involved. Because these outliers can be viewed as creating ambiguity, the phrase &quot;settlement-free peering&quot; is sometimes used to explicitly denote normal cost-free peering.

== History ==
The first Internet exchange point was the Commercial Internet eXchange (CIX), formed by Alternet/UUNET (now Verizon Business), PSI, and CERFNET to exchange traffic without regard for whether the traffic complied with the acceptable use policy (AUP) of the NSFNet or ANS&#x27; interconnection policy. The CIX infrastructure consisted of a single router, managed by PSI, and was initially located in Santa Clara, California. Paying CIX members were allowed to attach to the router directly or via leased lines. After some time, the router was also attached to the Pacific Bell SMDS cloud. The router was later moved to the Palo Alto Internet Exchange, or PAIX, which was developed and operated by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). Because the CIX operated at OSI layer 3, rather than OSI layer 2, and because it was not neutral, in the sense that it was operated by one of its participants rather than by all of them collectively, and it conducted lobbying activities supported by some of its participants and not by others, it would not today be considered an Internet exchange point. Nonetheless, it was the first thing to bear that name.

The first exchange point to resemble modern, neutral, Ethernet-based exchanges was the Metropolitan Area Ethernet, or MAE, in Tysons Corner, Virginia. When the United States government de-funded the NSFNET backbone, Internet exchange points were needed to replace its function, and initial governmental funding was used to aid the preexisting MAE and bootstrap three other exchanges, which they dubbed NAPs, or &quot;Network Access Points,&quot; in accordance with the terminology of the National Information Infrastructure document. All four are now defunct or no longer functioning as Internet exchange points:

*MAE-East – Located in Tysons Corner, Virginia, and later relocated to Ashburn, Virginia
*Chicago NAP – Operated by Ameritech and located in Chicago, Illinois
*New York NAP – Operated by Sprint and located in Pennsauken, New Jersey
*San Francisco NAP – Operated by PacBell and located in the Bay Area

As the Internet grew, and traffic levels increased, these NAPs became a network bottleneck. Most of the early NAPs utilized FDDI technology, which provided only 100 Mbit/s of capacity to each participant. Some of these exchanges upgraded to ATM technology, which provided OC-3 (155 Mbit/s) and OC-12 (622 Mbit/s) of capacity.

Other prospective exchange point operators moved directly into offering Ethernet technology, such as gigabit Ethernet (1,000 Mbit/s), which quickly became the predominant choice for Internet exchange points due to the reduced cost and increased capacity offered. Today, almost all significant exchange points operate solely over Ethernet, and most of the largest exchange points offer 10, 40, and even 100 gigabit service.

During the dot-com boom, many exchange point and carrier-neutral colocation providers had plans to build as many as 50 locations to promote carrier interconnection in the United States alone. Essentially all of these plans were abandoned following the dot-com bust, and today it is considered both economically and technically infeasible to support this level of interconnection among even the largest of networks.

==How peering works==
The Internet is a collection of separate and distinct networks referred to as autonomous systems, each one consisting of a set of globally unique IP addresses and a unique global BGP routing policy.

The interconnection relationships between Autonomous Systems are of exactly two types:

* Peering - Two networks exchange traffic between their users freely, and for mutual benefit.
* Transit – One network pays another network for access to the Internet.

Therefore, in order for a network to reach any specific other network on the Internet, it must either:

* Sell transit service to that network or a chain of resellers ending at that network (making them a &#x27;customer&#x27;),
* Peer with that network or with a network which sells transit service to that network, or
* Buy transit service from any other network (which is then responsible for providing interconnection to the rest of the Internet).

The Internet is based on the principle of &quot;global&quot; or &quot;end-to-end reachability&quot;, which means that any Internet user can transparently exchange traffic with any other Internet user. Therefore, a network is connected to the Internet if and only if it buys transit, or peers with every other network which also does not purchase transit (which together constitute a &quot;default free zone&quot; or &quot;DFZ&quot;).

Public peering is done at Internet exchange points (IXPs), while private peering can be done with direct links between networks.

==Motivations for peering==
Peering involves two networks coming together to exchange traffic with each other freely, and for mutual benefit. This &#x27;mutual benefit&#x27; is most often the motivation behind peering, which is often described solely by &quot;reduced costs for transit services&quot;. Other less tangible motivations can include:

* Increased redundancy (by reducing dependence on one or more transit providers).
* Increased capacity for extremely large amounts of traffic (distributing traffic across many networks).
* Increased routing control over one&#x27;s traffic.
* Improved performance (attempting to bypass potential bottlenecks with a &quot;direct&quot; path).
* Improved perception of one&#x27;s network (being able to claim a &quot;higher tier&quot;).
* Ease of requesting for emergency aid (from friendly peers).

==Physical interconnections for peering==

The physical interconnections used for peering are categorized into two types:

* Public peering – Interconnection utilizing a multi-party shared switch fabric such as an Ethernet switch.
* Private peering – Interconnection utilizing a point-to-point link between two parties.

===Public peering===
Public peering is accomplished across a Layer 2 access technology, generally called a &quot;shared fabric&quot;. At these locations, multiple carriers interconnect with one or more other carriers across a single physical port. Historically, public peering locations were known as network access points (NAPs). Today they are most often called exchange points or &quot;Internet exchanges&quot; (&quot;IXP&quot;). Many of the largest exchange points in the world can have hundreds of participants, and some span multiple buildings and colocation facilities across a city.

Since public peering allows networks interested in peering to interconnect with many other networks through a single port, it is often considered to offer &quot;less capacity&quot; than private peering, but to a larger number of networks. Many smaller networks, or networks which are just beginning to peer, find that public peering exchange points provide an excellent way to meet and interconnect with other networks which may be open to peering with them. Some larger networks utilize public peering as a way to aggregate a large number of &quot;smaller peers&quot;, or as a location for conducting low-cost &quot;trial peering&quot; without the expense of provisioning private peering on a temporary basis, while other larger networks are not willing to participate at public exchanges at all.

A few exchange points, particularly in the United States, are operated by commercial carrier-neutral third parties, which are critical for achieving cost-effective data center connectivity.

===Private peering===
Private peering is the direct interconnection between only two networks, across a Layer 1 or 2 medium that offers dedicated capacity that is not shared by any other parties. Early in the history of the Internet, many private peers occurred across &quot;telco&quot; provisioned SONET circuits between individual carrier-owned facilities. Today, most private interconnections occur at carrier hotels or carrier neutral colocation facilities, where a direct crossconnect can be provisioned between participants within the same building, usually for a much lower cost than telco circuits.

Most of the traffic on the Internet, especially traffic between the largest networks, occurs via private peering. However, because of the resources required to provision each private peer, many networks are unwilling to provide private peering to &quot;small&quot; networks, or to &quot;new&quot; networks which have not yet proven that they will provide a mutual benefit.

== Peering agreement ==
Throughout the history of the Internet, there have been a spectrum of kinds of agreements between peers, ranging from handshake agreements to written contracts as required by one or more parties. Such agreements set forth the details of how traffic is to be exchanged, along with a list of expected activities which may be necessary to maintain the peering relationship, a list of activities which may be considered abusive and result in termination of the relationship, and details concerning how the relationship can be terminated. Detailed contracts of this type are typically used between the largest ISPs, as well as the ones operating in the most heavily regulated economies. As of 2011, such contracts account for less than 0.5% of all peering agreements.

==Depeering==
By definition, peering is the voluntary and free exchange of traffic between two networks, for mutual benefit. If one or both networks believes that there is no longer a mutual benefit, they may decide to cease peering: this is known as depeering. Some of the reasons why one network may wish to depeer another include:

* A desire that the other network pay settlement, either in exchange for continued peering or for transit services.
* A belief that the other network is &quot;profiting unduly&quot; from the no-settlement interconnection.
* Concern over &quot;traffic ratios&quot;, which is related to the fair sharing of cost for the interconnection.
* A desire to peer with the upstream transit provider of the peered network.
* Abuse of the interconnection by the other party, such as &quot;pointing default&quot; or utilizing the peer for transit.
* Instability of the peered network, repeated routing leaks, lack of response to network abuse issues, etc.
* The inability or unwillingness of the peered network to provision additional capacity for peering.
* The belief that the peered network is unduly peering with one&#x27;s customers.
* Various external political factors (including personal conflicts between individuals at each network).

In some situations, networks which are being depeered have been known to attempt to fight to keep the peering by intentionally breaking the connectivity between the two networks when the peer is removed, either through a deliberate act or an act of omission. The goal is to force the depeering network to have so many customer complaints that they are willing to restore peering. Examples of this include forcing traffic via a path that does not have enough capacity to handle the load, or intentionally blocking alternate routes to or from the other network. Some notable examples of these situations have included:

* BBN Planet &quot;vs&quot; Exodus Communications
* PSINet &quot;vs&quot; Cable &amp; Wireless
* AOL Transit Data Network (ATDN) &quot;vs&quot; Cogent Communications
* France Telecom &quot;vs&quot; Cogent Communications

== Modern peering ==

=== Donut peering model ===

The &quot;donut peering&quot; model describes the intensive interconnection of small and medium-sized regional networks that make up much of the Internet. Traffic between these regional networks can be modeled as a toroid, with a core &quot;donut hole&quot; that is poorly interconnected to the networks around it.

As detailed above, some carriers attempted to form a cartel of self-described Tier 1 networks, nominally refusing to peer with any networks outside the oligopoly. Seeking to reduce transit costs, connections between regional networks bypass those &quot;core&quot; networks. Data takes a more direct path, reducing latency and packet loss. This also improves resiliency between consumers and content providers via multiple connections in many locations around the world, in particular during business disputes between the core transit providers.

=== Multilateral peering ===
The majority of BGP AS-AS adjacencies are the product of multilateral peering agreements, or MLPAs. In multilateral peering, an unlimited number of parties agree to exchange traffic on common terms, using a single agreement to which they each accede. The multilateral peering is typically technically instantiated in a route server or route reflector (which differ from looking glasses in that they serve routes back out to participants, rather than just listening to inbound routes) to redistribute routes via a BGP hub-and-spoke topology, rather than a partial-mesh topology. The two primary criticisms of multilateral peering are that it breaks the shared fate of the forwarding and routing planes, since the layer-2 connection between two participants could hypothetically fail while their layer-2 connections with the route server remained up, and that they force all participants to treat each other with the same, undifferentiated, routing policy. The primary benefit of multilateral peering is that it minimizes configuration for each peer, while maximizing the efficiency with which new peers can begin contributing routes to the exchange. While optional multilateral peering agreements and route servers are now widely acknowledged to be a good practice, mandatory multilateral peering agreements (MMLPAs) have long been agreed to not be a good practice.

=== Peering locations ===
The modern Internet operates with significantly more peering locations than at any time in the past, resulting in improved performance and better routing for the majority of the traffic on the Internet. However, in the interests of reducing costs and improving efficiency, most networks have attempted to standardize on relatively few locations within these individual regions where they will be able to quickly and efficiently interconnect with their peering partners.

===Exchange points===
As of 2021, the largest exchange points in the world are Ponto de Troca de Tráfego Metro São Paulo, in São Paulo, with 2,289 peering networks; OpenIXP in Jakarta, with 1,097 peering networks; and DE-CIX in Frankfurt, with 1,050 peering networks. The United States, with a historically larger focus on private peering and commercial public peering, has much less traffic visible on public peering switch-fabrics compared to other regions that are dominated by non-profit membership exchange points. Collectively, the many exchange points operated by Equinix are generally considered to be the largest, though traffic figures are not generally published. Other important but smaller exchange points include AMS-IX in Amsterdam, LINX and LONAP in London, and NYIIX in New York.

URLs to some public traffic statistics of exchange points include:
* AMS-IX
* DE-CIX

* LINX
* MSK-IX

* TORIX
* NYIIX

* LAIIX
* TOP-IX

* Netnod
* Mix Milano

* ix.br SP
* SFMIX
==Peering and BGP==
A great deal of the complexity in the BGP routing protocol exists to aid the enforcement and fine-tuning of peering and transit agreements. BGP allows operators to define a policy that determines where traffic is routed. Three things are commonly used to determine routing: local-preference, multi exit discriminators (MEDs) and AS-Path. Local-preference is used internally within a network to differentiate classes of networks. For example, a particular network will have a higher preference set on internal and customer advertisements. Settlement free peering is then configured to be preferred over paid IP transit.

Networks that speak BGP to each other can engage in multi exit discriminator exchange with each other, although most do not. When networks interconnect in several locations, MEDs can be used to reference that network&#x27;s interior gateway protocol cost. This results in both networks sharing the burden of transporting each other&#x27;s traffic on their own network (or &quot;cold potato&quot;). &quot;Hot-potato&quot; or nearest-exit routing, which is typically the normal behavior on the Internet, is where traffic destined to another network is delivered to the closest interconnection point.

==Law and policy==
Internet interconnection is not regulated in the same way that public telephone network interconnection is regulated. Nevertheless, Internet interconnection has been the subject of several areas of federal policy in the United States. Perhaps the most dramatic example of this is the attempted MCI Worldcom/Sprint merger. In this case, the Department of Justice blocked the merger specifically because of the impact of the merger on the Internet backbone market (thereby requiring MCI to divest itself of its successful &quot;internetMCI&quot; business to gain approval). In 2001, the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s advisory committee, the Network Reliability and Interoperability Council recommended that Internet backbones publish their peering policies, something that they had been hesitant to do beforehand. The FCC has also reviewed competition in the backbone market in its Section 706 proceedings which review whether advanced telecommunications are being provided to all Americans in a reasonable and timely manner.

Finally, Internet interconnection has become an issue in the international arena under something known as the International Charging Arrangements for Internet Services (ICAIS). In the ICAIS debate, countries underserved by Internet backbones have complained that it is unfair that they must pay the full cost of connecting to an Internet exchange point in a different country, frequently the United States. These advocates argue that Internet interconnection should work like international telephone interconnection, with each party paying half of the cost. Those who argue against ICAIS point out that much of the problem would be solved by building local exchange points. A significant amount of the traffic, it is argued, that is brought to the US and exchanged then leaves the US, using US exchange points as switching offices but not terminating in the US. In some worst-case scenarios, traffic from one side of a street is brought all the way to a distant exchange point in a foreign country, exchanged, and then returned to another side of the street. Countries with liberalized telecommunications and open markets, where competition between backbone providers occurs, tend to oppose ICAIS.

<text>The Free World is a propaganda term, primarily used during the Cold War from 1945 to 1991, to refer to the Western Bloc and aligned countries.

The term refers more broadly to all liberal democracies collectively, as opposed to authoritarian regimes and communist states. It has traditionally primarily been used to refer to the countries allied and aligned with the United States, the European Union, and NATO. The term &quot;leader of the free world&quot; has been used to imply a symbolic and moral leadership, and was mostly used during the Cold War in reference to the president of the United States.

==History of the concept==

===Origins===
During World War II, the Allied powers viewed themselves as opposing the oppression and fascism of the Axis powers, thus making them &quot;free&quot;. Following the end of World War II, the Cold War conception of the &quot;Free World&quot; included only anti-Soviet states as being &quot;free&quot;, particularly democratically elected states with free speech, a free press, freedom of assembly and freedom of association.

During the Cold War, many neutral countries, either those in what is considered the Third World, or those having no formal alliance with either the United States or the Soviet Union, viewed the claim of &quot;Free World&quot; leadership by the United States as grandiose and illegitimate.

One of the earliest uses of the term &quot;Free World&quot; as a politically significant term occurs in Frank Capra&#x27;s World War II propaganda film series &quot;Why We Fight&quot;. In &quot;Prelude to War&quot;, the first film of that series, the &quot;free world&quot; is portrayed as a white planet, directly contrasted with the black planet called the &quot;slave world&quot;. The film depicts the free world as the Western Hemisphere, led by the United States and Western Europe, and the slave world as the Eastern Hemisphere, dominated by Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and the Japanese Empire.

===21st century usage===
While &quot;Free World&quot; had its origins in the Cold War, the phrase is still used after the end of the Cold War and during the Global War on Terrorism. Samuel P. Huntington said the term has been replaced by the concept of the international community, which, he argued, &quot;has become the euphemistic collective noun (replacing &quot;the Free World&quot;) to give global legitimacy to actions reflecting the interests of the United States and other Western powers.&quot;

==Leadership of the Free World==

===United States===

The &quot;Leader of the Free World&quot; was a colloquialism, first used during the Cold War, to describe either the United States or, more commonly, the president of the United States. The term when used in this context suggested that the United States was the principal democratic superpower, and the U.S. president was by extension the leader of the world&#x27;s democratic states, i.e. the &quot;Free World&quot;.

The phrase has its origin in the 1940s during the Second World War, especially through the anti-fascist &quot;Free World&quot; magazine and the American propaganda film series &quot;Why We Fight&quot;. At this time, the term was criticized for including the Soviet Union (USSR), which critics saw as a totalitarian dictatorship. However, the term became more widely used against the USSR and its allies during the 1950s in the wake of Truman Doctrine, when the United States depicted a foreign policy based on a struggle between &quot;a democratic alliance and a communist realm set on world domination&quot;, according to the American magazine &quot;The Atlantic&quot;. The term here was criticized again for including right-wing dictatorships such as Francoist Spain, and Nikita Khrushchev said in the 21st Congress of the Soviet Communist Party that &quot;the so-called free world constitutes the kingdom of the dollar&quot;.

Although in decline after the mid-1970s, the term was heavily referenced in US foreign policy up until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991. After the presidency of George H. W. Bush the term has largely fallen out of use, in part for its usage in rhetoric critical of U.S. foreign policy. However, the term is still used at times to described the president of the United States.

===European Union=== 
On 6 May 2010, upon an address to the plenary chamber of the European Parliament, the then US Vice President Joe Biden, stated that Brussels had a &quot;legitimate claim&quot; to the title of &quot;capital of the free world&quot;, normally a title reserved for Washington. He added that Brussels is a &quot;great city which boasts 1,000 years of history and serves as capital of Belgium, the home of many of the institutions of the European Union and the headquarters of the NATO alliance.&quot;

===Germany=== 
When &quot;Time&quot; declared the German Chancellor Angela Merkel Time Person of the Year for 2015, they referred to her as &quot;Europe&#x27;s most powerful leader&quot;, and the cover bore the title &quot;Chancellor of the Free World&quot;. 
Following the election of Donald Trump to the US presidency in November 2016, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Merkel &quot;the Liberal West&#x27;s Last Defender&quot;, and a number of commentators called her &quot;the next leader of the free world&quot;. Merkel herself rejected the description. An article by James Rubin in Politico about a White House meeting between Merkel and Trump was ironically titled &quot;The Leader of the Free World Meets Donald Trump&quot;.

German commentators agreed with Merkel&#x27;s assessment, and Friedrich Merz, a CDU politician, said that a German chancellor could never be &quot;leader of the free world&quot;. In April 2017, columnist James Kirchick stressed the importance of the German elections (on which &quot;the future of the free world&quot; depended) since America had &quot;abdicated its traditional role as leader of the free world by electing Trump, the United Kingdom was turning inward after the referendum decision to leave the European Union, and France was also traditionally unilateralist and now had an inexperienced president&quot;; he called Merkel &quot;something less than leader of the free world ... but something greater than the leader of just another random country&quot;. References to America&#x27;s abdication of its role as leader of the free world continued or increased after Donald Trump questioned the unconditional defence of NATO partners and the Paris climate accord.

Jagoda Marinić, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, noted that &quot;Barack Obama all but literally passed on the mantle of &#x27;leader of the free world&#x27; to Ms. Merkel (and not Mr. Trump), and most Germans feel empowered by that new responsibility&quot; and that Germany &quot;is coming to understand its role in standing up for liberal democracy in a world turning more and more authoritarian.&quot;

Other commentators—in the United States and Europe—rejected the appellation &quot;Leader of the Free World&quot;: some argued that there is no single leader of the &#x27;free world&#x27;; others queried whether Merkel &quot;remained&quot; the &quot;leader of the free world&quot; and the champion of liberal values. Questioned about Merkel&#x27;s standing following her performance in the German elections in September 2017, former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton opined that Merkel was &quot;the most important leader in the free world&quot;. However, after Merkel&#x27;s party suffered losses in the 2017 election and there were delays in forming a government, the claim that Merkel is the true leader of the free world was referred to as a &quot;joke&quot;, described as a media phenomenon, and otherwise called into question.

When Merkel retired as chancellor, Hillary Clinton wrote that &quot;she led Europe through difficult times with steadiness and bravery, and for four long years, she was the leader of the free world.&quot;

<doc id="47014" wikidata="Q820947" url="?curid=47014" title="Metric time">
<text>Metric time is the measure of time intervals using the metric system. The modern SI system defines the second as the base unit of time, and forms multiples and submultiples with metric prefixes such as kiloseconds and milliseconds. Other units of time – minute, hour, and day – are accepted for use with SI, but are not part of it. Metric time is a measure of time intervals, while decimal time is a means of recording time of day.

==History==

The second is derived from the sexagesimal system, which originated with the Sumerians and Babylonians. This system divides a base unit into sixty minutes, each minute into sixty seconds, and each second into sixty tierces. The word &quot;minute&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;pars minuta prima&quot;, meaning &quot;first small part&quot;, and &quot;second&quot; from &quot;pars minuta secunda&quot; or &quot;second small part&quot;. Angular measure also uses sexagesimal units; there, it is the degree that is subdivided into minutes and seconds, while in time, it is the hour.

In 1790, French diplomat Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord proposed that the fundamental unit of length for the metric system should be the length of a pendulum with a one-second period, measured at sea level on the 45th parallel (50 grades in the new angular measures), thus basing the metric system on the value of the second. A Commission of Weights and Measures was formed within the French Academy of Sciences to develop the system. The commission rejected the seconds-pendulum definition of the metre the following year because the second of time was an arbitrary period equal to 1/86,400 day, rather than a decimal fraction of a natural unit. Instead, the metre would be defined as a decimal fraction of the length of the Paris Meridian between the equator and the North Pole.

The commission initially proposed the decimal time units later enacted as part of the new Republican calendar. In January, 1791, Jean-Charles de Borda commissioned Louis Berthoud to manufacture a decimal chronometer displaying these units. On March 28, 1794, the commission&#x27;s president, Joseph Louis Lagrange, proposed using the day (French &quot;jour&quot;) as the base unit of time, with divisions &quot;déci-jour&quot; and &quot;centi-jour,&quot; and suggested representing 4 &quot;déci-jours&quot; and 5 &quot;centi-jours&quot; as &quot;4,5&quot;, &quot;4/5&quot;, or just &quot;45&quot;. The final system, as introduced in 1795, included units for length, area, dry volume, liquid capacity, weight or mass, and currency, but not time. Decimal time of day had been introduced in France two years earlier, but mandatory use was suspended at the same time the metric system was inaugurated, and did not follow the metric pattern of a base unit and prefixed units.

Base units equivalent to decimal divisions of the day, such as 1/10, 1/100, 1/1,000, or 1/100,000 day, or other divisions of the day, such as 1/20 or 1/40 day, have also been proposed, with various names. Such alternative units did not gain any notable acceptance. In China, during the Song dynasty, a day was divided into smaller units, called &quot;kè&quot; (). One &quot;kè&quot; was usually defined as of a day until 1628, though there were short periods before then where days had 96, 108 or 120 &quot;kè&quot;. A kè is about 14.4 minutes, or 14 minutes 24 seconds. In the 19th century, Joseph Charles François de Rey-Pailhade endorsed Lagrange’s proposal of using &quot;centijours,&quot; but abbreviated &quot;cé&quot;, and divided into 10 &quot;decicés&quot;, 100 &quot;centicés&quot;, 1,000 &quot;millicés&quot;, and 10,000 &quot;dimicés&quot;.

James Clerk Maxwell and Elihu Thomson (through the British Association for the Advancement of Science, or BAAS) introduced the Centimetre gram second system of units in 1874 to derive electric and magnetic metric units, following the recommendation of Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1832.

In 1897, the &quot;Commission de décimalisation du temps&quot; was created by the French Bureau of Longitude, with the mathematician Henri Poincaré as secretary. The commission proposed making the standard hour the base unit of metric time, but the proposal did not gain acceptance and was eventually abandoned.

When the modern SI system was defined at the 10th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) in 1954, the ephemeris second (1/86400 of a mean solar day) was made one of the system&#x27;s base units. Because the Earth&#x27;s rotation is slowly decelerating at an irregular rate and was thus unsuitable as a reference point for precise measurements, the SI second was later redefined more precisely as the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom. The international standard atomic clocks use caesium-133 measurements as their main benchmark.

==In computing==

In computing, at least internally, metric time gained widespread use for ease of computation. Unix time gives date and time as the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, and Microsoft&#x27;s NTFS FILETIME as multiples of 100 ns since January 1, 1601. VAX/VMS uses the number of 100 ns since November 17, 1858, and RISC OS the number of centiseconds since January 1, 1900. Microsoft Excel uses number of days (with decimals, floating point) since January 1, 1900.

All these systems present time for the user using traditional units. None of these systems is strictly linear, as they each have discontinuities at leap seconds.

==Prefixes==

Metric prefixes for subdivisions of a second are commonly used in science and technology. Milliseconds and microseconds are particularly common. Prefixes for multiples of a second are rarely used:

<doc id="47016" wikidata="Q106199" url="?curid=47016" title="Commentarii de Bello Gallico">
<text>Commentarii de Bello Gallico (; ), also Bellum Gallicum (), is Julius Caesar&#x27;s firsthand account of the Gallic Wars, written as a third-person narrative. In it, Caesar describes the battles and intrigues that took place in the nine years he spent fighting the Celtic and Germanic peoples in Gaul that opposed Roman conquest.

The &quot;Gaul&quot; that Caesar refers to is ambiguous, as the term had various connotations in Roman writing and discourse during Caesar&#x27;s time. Generally, Gaul included all of the regions primarily inhabited by Celts, aside from the province of Gallia Narbonensis (modern-day Provence and Languedoc-Roussillon), which had already been conquered in Caesar&#x27;s time; therefore encompassing the rest of modern France, Belgium, Western Germany, and parts of Switzerland. As the Roman Republic made inroads deeper into Celtic territory and conquered more land, the definition of &quot;Gaul&quot; shifted. Concurrently, &quot;Gaul&quot; was also used in common parlance as a synonym for &quot;uncouth&quot; or &quot;unsophisticated&quot; as Romans saw Celtic peoples as uncivilized compared with themselves.

The work has been a mainstay in Latin instruction because of its simple, direct prose. It begins with the frequently quoted phrase &quot;Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres&quot;, meaning &quot;Gaul is a whole divided into three parts&quot;. The full work is split into eight sections, Book 1 to Book 8, varying in size from approximately 5,000 to 15,000 words. Book 8 was written by Aulus Hirtius, after Caesar&#x27;s death.

Although most contemporaries and subsequent historians considered the account truthful, 20th-century historians have questioned the outlandish claims made in the work. Of particular note are Caesar&#x27;s claims that the Romans fought Gallic forces of up to 430,000 (a size believed to be impossible for an army at that time), and that the Romans suffered no deaths against this incredibly large force.

The Latin title, &quot;Commentaries on the Gallic War&quot;, is often retained in English translations of the book, and the title is also translated to &quot;About the Gallic War&quot;, &quot;Of the Gallic War&quot;, &quot;On the Gallic War&quot;, &quot;The Conquest of Gaul&quot;, and &quot;The Gallic War&quot;.

==Motivations==

The victories in Gaul won by Caesar had increased the alarm and hostility of his enemies at Rome, and his aristocratic enemies, the Optimates, were spreading rumors about his intentions once he returned from Gaul. The optimates intended to prosecute Caesar for abuse of his authority upon his return, when he would lay down his imperium. Such prosecution would not only see Caesar stripped of his wealth and citizenship, but also negate all of the laws he enacted during his term as Consul and his dispositions as pro-consul of Gaul. To defend himself against these threats, Caesar knew he needed the support of the plebeians, particularly the Tribunes of the Plebs, on whom he chiefly relied for help in carrying out his agenda. The &quot;Commentaries&quot; were an effort by Caesar to directly communicate with the plebeians – thereby circumventing the usual channels of communication that passed through the Senate – to propagandize his activities as efforts to increase the glory and influence of Rome. By winning the support of the people, Caesar sought to make himself unassailable from the boni.

== Synopsis ==

The &quot;Commentarii&quot; cover the Gallic Wars over a period of eight years, beginning with conflict over the migration of the Helvetii in 58 BC, which drew in neighboring tribes and the Germanic Suebi. By 57 BC, Caesar had resolved to conquer all of Gaul, and led campaigns in the east, where the Nervii nearly defeated him. In 56 BC, Caesar defeated the Veneti in a naval battle and took most of northwest Gaul. In 55 BC, Caesar sought to boost his public image, and undertook expeditions across the Rhine river and the English Channel that were the first of their kind. Upon his return from Britain, Caesar was hailed as a hero, though he had achieved little beyond landing because his army had been too small and he was unable to land his cavalry. The next year, he went back with a larger army, including cavalry, and was more successful, setting up a friendly king and bringing his rival to terms. However, tribes rose up on the continent, and the Romans suffered a humiliating defeat. 53 BC saw a draconian campaign against the Gauls in an attempt to pacify them. This failed, and the Gauls staged a mass revolt under the leadership of Vercingetorix in 52 BC. Gallic forces won a notable victory at the Battle of Gergovia, but the Romans&#x27; indomitable siege works at the Battle of Alesia utterly defeated the Gallic coalition.

In 51 BC and 50 BC, there was little resistance, and Caesar&#x27;s troops were mostly mopping up. Gaul was conquered, although it would not become a Roman province until 27 BC, and resistance would continue until as late as 70 AD. There is no clear end-date for the war, but the imminent Roman Civil War led to the withdrawal of Caesar&#x27;s troops in 50 BC. Caesar&#x27;s wild successes in the war had made him extremely wealthy and provided a legendary reputation. The Gallic Wars were a key factor in Caesar&#x27;s ability to win the Civil War and declare himself dictator, in what would eventually lead to the end of the Roman Republic and the establishment of the Roman Empire.

==Motifs and peoples in the &quot;De Bello Gallico&quot;==

=== Leaders of the Gallic tribes ===
In the &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot;, Caesar mentions several leaders of the Gallic tribes. Among these, Diviciacus and Vercingetorix are notable for their contributions to the Gauls during war.

==== Diviciacus ====
Books 1 and 6 detail the importance of Diviciacus, a leader of the Haedui (Aedui), which lies mainly in the friendly relationship between Caesar and Diviciacus, said to be &quot;the one person in whom Caesar had absolute confidence&quot; (1.41). His brother, Dumnorix had committed several acts against the Romans because he wanted to become king (1.18); thus Caesar was able to make his alliance with Diviciacus even stronger by sparing Dumnorix from punishment while also forcing Diviciacus to control his own brother. Diviciacus had, in tears, begged Caesar to spare the life of his brother, and Caesar saw an opportunity to not only fix his major problem with Dumnorix, but also to strengthen the relationship between Rome and one of its small allies. Another major action taken by Diviciacus was his imploring of Caesar to take action against the Germans and their leader, Ariovistus. His fear of Ariovistus and the general outcry from the Gallic people led Caesar to launch a campaign against the Germans, even though they had been considered friends of the Republic.

==== Vercingetorix ====

Vercingetorix, leader of the Arverni, united the Gallic tribes against Caesar during the winter of 53–52 BC. This appears in Book VII, chapters 1–13. Vercingetorix&#x27;s father, Celtillus, was killed after attempting to seize power amongst the Arverni; for that reason, Vercingetorix was a social outcast and had much to gain from a rebellion. When it was clear that Caesar had defeated the Gallic rebellion, Vercingetorix offered to sacrifice himself, and put himself at the mercy of Caesar, in order to ensure that his kinsmen were spared. After the defeat, Vercingetorix was brought to Rome and imprisoned for six years before being brought out to adorn Caesar&#x27;s triumph over Gaul and then publicly executed. Today, Vercingetorix is seen in the same light as others who opposed Roman conquest; he is now considered a national hero in France and a model patriot.

=== The Germanic peoples ===

In &quot;De Bello Gallico&quot; 6.21–28, Julius Caesar provides his audience with a picture of Germanic lifestyle and culture. He depicts the Germans as primitive hunter gatherers with diets mostly consisting of meat and dairy products who only celebrate earthly gods such as the sun, fire, and the moon (6.21–22). German women reportedly wear small cloaks of deer hides and bathe in the river naked with their fellow men, yet their culture celebrates men who abstain from sex for as long as possible (6.21). Caesar concludes in chapters 25–28 by describing the Germans living in the almost-mythological Hercynian forest full of oxen with horns in the middle of their foreheads, elks without joints or ligatures, and uri who kill every man they come across.

However, the distinguishing characteristic of the Germans for Caesar, as described in chapters 23 and 24, is their warring nature, which they believe is a sign of true valour (6.23). The Germans have no neighbors, because they have driven everyone out from their surrounding territory (6.23). Their greatest political power resides in the wartime magistrates, who have power over life and death (6.23). While Caesar certainly respects the warring instincts of the Germans, he directs his readers to see that their cultures are simply too barbaric, especially when contrasted with the high-class Gallic Druids described at the beginning of chapter six. For example, Caesar writes that robberies committed outside of the state are legalized in hopes of teaching young people discipline and caution, an idea nearly offensive to the judicial practices of the Romans (6.23). Caesar&#x27;s generalizations, alongside the writings of Tacitus, form the barbaric identity of the Germans for the ancient world.

=== The Druids ===
Caesar&#x27;s account of the Druids and the &quot;superstitions&quot; of the Gallic nations are documented in Book 6, chapters 13, 14 and 16–18 of &quot;De Bello Gallico&quot;. In chapter 13, he mentions the importance of Druids in the culture and social structure of Gaul at the time of his conquest. Chapter 14 addresses the education of the Druids and the high social standing that comes with their position. He first comments on the role of sacrificial practices in their daily lives in chapter 16. Caesar highlights the sacrificial practices of the Druids containing innocent people and the large sacrificial ceremony where hundreds of people were burnt alive at one time to protect the whole from famine, plague, and war (6.16). Chapter 17 and 18 focuses on the divinities the Gauls believed in and Dis, the god which they claim they were descended from. This account of the Druids highlights Caesar&#x27;s interest in the order and importance of the Druids in Gaul.

Caesar spent a great amount of time in Gaul and his book is one of the best preserved accounts of the Druids from an author who was in Gaul. However, although Caesar provides what is seemingly a first-hand account, much of his knowledge of the Druids comes not from personal experience, but rather from the hearsay of others, and is regarded as anachronistic. Caesar based some of his account on that of Posidonius, who wrote a clear and well-known account of the Druids in Gaul. Caesar provides his account of the Druids as a means of sharing his knowledge and educating the Roman people on the foreign conquests.

There is no doubt that the Druids offered sacrifices to their god. However, scholars are still uncertain about what kind of offerings they made. Caesar and other Roman authors assert that the Druids would offer human sacrifices on numerous occasions for relief from disease and famine or for a successful war campaign. Caesar provides a detailed account of the manner in which the supposed human sacrifices occurred in chapter 16, claiming that &quot;they have images of immense size, the limbs of which are framed with twisted twigs and filled with living persons. These being set on fire, those within are encompassed by the flames&quot; (6.16).

Caesar, however, also observes and mentions a civil Druid culture. In chapter 13, he claims that they selected a single leader who ruled until his death, and a successor would be chosen by a vote or through violence. Also in chapter 13, he mentions that the Druids studied &quot;the stars and their movements, the size of the cosmos and the earth, the nature of the world, and the powers of immortal deities,&quot; signifying to the Roman people that the Druids were also versed in astrology, cosmology, and theology. Although Caesar is one of the few primary sources on the Druids, many believe that he had used his influence to portray the Druids to the Roman people as both barbaric, as they performed human sacrifices, and civilized in order to depict the Druids as a society worth assimilating to Rome (6.16).

=== Vorenus and Pullo ===

Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo were two centurions in the garrison of Quintus Tullius Cicero, brother of Marcus Tullius Cicero, and are mentioned in Book 5.44 of &quot;De Bello Gallico&quot;. They were bitter rivals who both sought to achieve the greatest honors &quot;and every year used to contend for promotion with the utmost animosity&quot; (5.44). Their garrison had come under siege during a rebellion by the tribes of the Belgae led by Ambiorix. They showed their prowess during this siege by jumping from the wall and directly into the enemy despite being completely outnumbered. During the fighting, they both find themselves in difficult positions and are forced to save each other, first Vorenus saving Pullo and then Pullo saving Vorenus. Through great bravery they are both able to make it back alive slaying many enemies in the process. They return to the camp showered in praise and honors by their fellow soldiers. Though they started out in competition, they both showed themselves to be worthy of the highest praise and equal to each other in bravery (5.44).

Caesar uses this anecdote to illustrate the courage and bravery of his soldiers. Since his forces had already been humiliated and defeated in previous engagements, he needed to report a success story to Rome that would lift the spirits of the people. Furthermore, the tale of unity on the battlefield between two personal rivals is in direct opposition to the disunity of Sabinus and Cotta, which resulted in the destruction of an entire legion. He relates this particular account to illustrate that, despite the losses against Ambiorix and his army, Rome is still able to trust in the valor of its soldiers. Thus, Caesar turns a military blunder into a positive propaganda story.

===Hostage exchanges===
In the first two books of &quot;De Bello Gallico&quot;, there are seven examples of hostage exchanges. First, the Helveti exchange hostages with the Sequani as a promise that the Sequani will let the Helveti pass and that the Helveti will not cause mischief (1.9 and 1.19). The Helveti also give Caesar hostages to ensure that the Helveti keep their promises (1.14). Then the Aedui gave hostages to the Sequani, during the Sequani&#x27;s rise to power (1.31). In Book 2, the Belgae were exchanging hostages to create an alliance against Rome (2.1) and the Remi offered Caesar hostages in their surrender (2.3, 2.5). Later in the book Caesar receives 600 hostages from the Aedui (2.15) and other hostages from most of Gaul (2.35). This practice of exchanging hostages continues to be used throughout Caesar&#x27;s campaigns in diplomacy and foreign policy.

Today the term hostage has a different connotation than it did for the Ancient Romans, which is shown in the examples above. Where the Romans did take prisoners of war, hostages could also be given or exchanged in times of peace. The taking of hostages as collateral during political arrangements was a common practice in ancient Rome. The idea of the practice was that important people from each side were given to ensure that both sides kept their word; a type of contract. Two examples of this: Caesar demanding the children of chieftains (2.5) and accepting the two sons of King Galba (2.13). However, as seen by Caesar, sometimes it was only a one-way exchange, with Caesar taking hostages but not giving any.

There is evidence though, particularly in Caesar&#x27;s &quot;De Bello Gallico&quot;, indicating that the practice was not always effective. Cities often moved to rebel against Rome, even though hostages were in Roman custody. Occasionally, hostages would be entrusted to a neutral or mediating party during a rebellion, such as the time one hundred hostages surrendered by the Senones were placed in the custody of the Aedui who helped negotiate between the dissidents and Caesar. Some sources say there is not much evidence that hostages were even harmed, at least severely, in retribution of the broken agreements. It is commonly noted that Caesar never mentions penalties being dealt to hostages. Taking hostages did benefit Rome in one particular way: since hostages were commonly the sons of political figures and would typically be under Roman watch for a year or more, Romans had ample time to introduce those hostages to the Roman customs in hopes that when they were freed, they would go on to become influential political leaders themselves and favor Rome in subsequent foreign relations.

==Modern influence==
===Educational use===
This book is often lauded for its polished, clear Latin; in particular, German historian Hans Herzfeld describes the work as &quot;a paradigm of proper reporting and stylistic clarity&quot;.
It is traditionally the first authentic text assigned to students of Latin, as Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Anabasis&quot; is for students of Ancient Greek; they are both autobiographical tales of military adventure told in the third person. It contains many details and employs many stylistic devices to promote Caesar&#x27;s political interests.

The books are valuable for the many geographical and historical claims that can be retrieved from the work. Notable chapters describe Gaulish custom (6.13), their religion (6.17), and a comparison between Gauls and Germanic peoples (6.24).

===In modern media===

* Since Caesar is one of the characters in the &quot;Astérix and Obélix&quot; albums, René Goscinny included gags for French schoolchildren who had the &quot;Commentarii&quot; as a textbook, even though Latin was then disappearing from French schools. One example is having Caesar talk about himself in the third person as in the book. Most English editions of &quot;Asterix&quot; begin with the prelude: &quot;The year is 50 BC. Gaul is entirely occupied by the Romans. Well not entirely! One small village of indomitable Gauls still holds out against the invaders.&quot; In the 36th book of the Asterix series, &quot;Asterix and the Missing Scroll&quot;, a fictitious and supposedly censored chapter from Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries on the Gallic War&quot; forms the basis for the story.
* In Book 5, Chapter 44 the &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot; notably mentions Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo, two Roman centurions of the 11th Legion. The 2005 television series &quot;Rome&quot; gives a fictionalized account of Caesar&#x27;s rise and fall, featuring Kevin McKidd as the character of Lucius Vorenus and Ray Stevenson as the character of Titus Pullo of the 13th Legion.
* During World War I the French composer Vincent d&#x27;Indy wrote his Third Symphony, which bears the title &quot;De Bello Gallico&quot;. D&#x27;Indy was adapting Caesar&#x27;s title to the situation of the current struggle in France against the German army, in which he had a son and nephew fighting, and which the music illustrates to some extent.

== Manuscripts and publication history ==
Since the work of Karl Nipperdey in 1847, the existing manuscripts have been divided into two classes. The first (α) encompasses manuscripts containing only &quot;De Bello Gallico&quot; and characterized by colophons with allusions to late antique &quot;correctores&quot;. The oldest manuscript in this class is MS. Amsterdam 73, written at Fleury Abbey in the later ninth century. The second (β) encompasses manuscripts containing all of the related works—not only &quot;De Bello Gallico&quot;, but &quot;De Bello Civili&quot;, &quot;De Bello Alexandrino&quot;, &quot;De Bello Africo&quot;, and &quot;De Bello Hispaniensi&quot;, always in that order. The oldest manuscript in this class is MS Paris lat. 3864, written at Corbie in the last quarter of the ninth century. For &quot;De Bello Gallico&quot;, the readings of α are considered better than β. 

The &quot;editio princeps&quot; was published by Giovanni Andrea Bussi at Rome in 1469.

The original publication time of the &quot;Bello Gallico&quot; is uncertain. It had been definitely published by 46 BC, when Cicero reviewed it and gave it great praise. It is unclear whether the books were released individually, or all at once. Nipperdey&#x27;s 1847 account believed that they had been mostly all composed at once in 50 BC. Frank Adcock suggested in 1956 that they had been written in stages, but then published simultaneously. T. P. Wiseman believed they were written and published yearly, as Caesar would have gained enormous utility from keeping the public informed about his exploits. The debate as to the time and nature of publication continues, with critical examination of the evolution of the writing style the chief tool for dating the work. Even if the works were published after the wars, it was clear that Caesar was waging a propaganda campaign during the war, including writing copious letters to his political allies back in Rome. Because of the questionable nature of the war, and threats by his enemies to have him essentially tried for war crimes, winning the public relations battle was critical for Caesar.

== Historiography ==

=== Accuracy ===
Caesar&#x27;s account was largely taken as truthful and accurate until the 20th century. Nipperdey&#x27;s manuscript in 1847 was considered &quot;monumental&quot;, and was the first critical examination of the text, which considered Caesar to be infallible. Nipperdey even chose to modify his translation of the text where it contradicted itself, giving Caesar the benefit of any doubts. Even in 1908, Camille Jullian wrote a comprehensive history of Gaul and took Caesar&#x27;s account as unerring. But after World War II historians began to question if Caesar&#x27;s claims stood up.

Historian David Henige takes particular issue with the supposed population and warrior counts. Caesar claims that he was able to estimate the population of the Helvetii because in their camp there was a census, written in Greek on tablets, which would have indicated 263,000 Helvetii and 105,000 allies, of whom exactly one quarter (92,000) were combatants. But Henige points out that such a census would have been difficult to achieve by the Gauls, that it would make no sense to be written in Greek by non-Greek tribes, and that carrying such a large quantity of stone or wood tablets on their migration would have been a monumental feat. Henige finds it oddly convenient that exactly one quarter were combatants, suggesting that the numbers were more likely ginned up by Caesar than outright counted by census. Even contemporary authors estimated that the population of the Helvetii and their allies were lower, Livy surmised that there were 157,000 overall. But Henige still believes this number inaccurate.

During the campaign against the Usipetes and the Tenceri, Caesar makes the incredible claim that the Romans faced an army of 430,000 Gauls, that the Roman victory was overwhelming, that the Romans lost not a single soldier, and that upon their loss the Gauls committed mass suicide. Henige finds this entire story impossible, as did Ferdinand Lot, writing in 1947. Lot was one of the first modern authors who directly questioned the validity of Caesar&#x27;s numbers, finding a fighting force of 430,000 to have been unbelievable for the time. 

Not all contemporaries of Caesar believed the account to have been accurate. Gaius Asinius Pollio, who served under Caesar, noted that the account had been put together without much care or regard for the truth. Still, Pollio attributed this to mistakes by Caesar&#x27;s lieutenants, or even that Caesar intended to rewrite the text more accurately. Up until the 20th century authors tended to follow Pollio&#x27;s thinking, attributing mistakes not to Caesar but to the process, such as errors in translation and transcription throughout time. Ernest Desjardins, writing in 1876, suggested (in what Henige considers to be very charitable on Desjardins part) that the error in numbers in the Usipetes campaign was the result of a mis-transcription of &quot;CCCCXXX&quot; instead of &quot;XXXXIII&quot;, which would mean that the real size of the Gaulic force was actually just 43,000. But even Henige suggests that it is possible the numbers have not always been accurately written down, and that the earliest surviving manuscripts are only from the ninth to twelfth centuries.

Part of the dispute over the historiography of the &quot;Commentarii&quot; revolves around modern authors trying to use it to estimate the pre-Roman population of Gaul. In the 18th century, authors extrapolated from the text populations of 40200 million. Authors in the 19th century guessed in the 15–20 million range based on the text. 20th century authors guessed as low as 4 million, with Henige giving a modern range of 4–48 million between authors.

Ultimately, Henige sees the &quot;Commentarii&quot; as a very clever piece of propaganda written by Caesar, built to make Caesar appear far grander than he was. Henige notes that Caesar&#x27;s matter of fact tone and easy to read writing made it all the easier to accept his outlandish claims. Caesar sought to portray his fight as a justified defense against the barbarity of the Gauls (which was important, as Caesar had actually been the aggressor contrary to his claims). By making it appear that he had won against overwhelming odds and suffered minimal casualties, he further increased the belief that he and the Romans were godly and destined to win against the godless barbarians of Gaul. Overall, Henige concludes that &quot;Julius Caesar must be considered one of history&#x27;s earliest and most durably successful &#x27;spin doctors&#x27;&quot;.

=== Authorship ===
Classicist Ruth Breindal believes it likely that Caesar did not directly write the work, but instead dictated most of it to a scribe at one time and the scribe wrote as Caesar spoke, or that the scribe took notes and wrote the account afterwards. Still, she does believe that Caesar had an overwhelming hand in creating the work, but believes much of the grammar and clarity of the work to be the result of the scribe or scribes involved. Breindal also considers the main point of the work to be as a propaganda piece to protect Caesar&#x27;s reputation in the vicious politics of Rome. Book eight was written after Caesar&#x27;s death in 44 BC by consul Aulus Hirtius; Hirtius must have written the book before his own death in the civil war in 43 BC.

The author portrays Caesar&#x27;s thoughts frequently, with an emphasis on making Caesar seem efficient, decisive, and straightforward, and that his view on how war should be waged is the same. The work paints the conflict as inevitable and necessary.

=== As literature ===
From the 1970s, some critics began to regard the work less as history than literature, in the tradition of poets following the model of Homer.

<text>A package manager or package management system is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs for a computer in a consistent manner.

A package manager deals with &quot;packages&quot;, distributions of software and data in archive files. Packages contain metadata, such as the software&#x27;s name, description of its purpose, version number, vendor, checksum (preferably a cryptographic hash function), and a list of dependencies necessary for the software to run properly. Upon installation, metadata is stored in a local package database. Package managers typically maintain a database of software dependencies and version information to prevent software mismatches and missing prerequisites. They work closely with software repositories, binary repository managers, and app stores.

Package managers are designed to eliminate the need for manual installs and updates. This can be particularly useful for large enterprises whose operating systems typically consist of hundreds or even tens of thousands of distinct software packages.

== History ==
An early package manager was SMIT (and its backend installp) from IBM AIX. SMIT was introduced with AIX 3.0 in 1989.

Early package managers, from around 1994, had no automatic dependency resolution but could already drastically simplify the process of adding and removing software from a running system.

By around 1995, beginning with CPAN, package managers began doing the work of downloading packages from a repository, automatically resolving its dependencies and installing them as needed, making it much easier to install, uninstall and update software from a system.

==Functions==
A software package is an archive file containing a computer program as well as necessary metadata for its deployment. The computer program can be in source code that has to be compiled and built first. Package metadata include package description, package version, and dependencies (other packages that need to be installed beforehand).

Package managers are charged with the task of finding, installing, maintaining or uninstalling software packages upon the user&#x27;s command. Typical functions of a package management system include:
*Working with file archivers to extract package archives
*Ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the package by verifying their checksums and digital certificates, respectively
*Looking up, downloading, installing, or updating existing software from a software repository or app store
*Grouping packages by function to reduce user confusion
*Managing dependencies to ensure a package is installed with all packages it requires, thus avoiding &quot;dependency hell&quot;

===Challenges with shared libraries===
Computer systems that rely on dynamic library linking, instead of static library linking, share executable libraries of machine instructions across packages and applications. In these systems, conflicting relationships between different packages requiring different versions of libraries results in a challenge colloquially known as &quot;dependency hell&quot;. On Microsoft Windows systems, this is also called &quot;DLL hell&quot; when working with dynamically linked libraries.

Modern package managers have mostly solved these problems, by allowing parallel installation of multiple versions of a library (e.g. OPENSTEP&#x27;s &quot;Framework&quot; system), a dependency of any kind (e.g. &quot;slots&quot; in Gentoo Portage), and even of packages compiled with different compiler versions (e.g. dynamic libraries built by the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, where a stable ABI does not exist), in order to enable other packages to specify which version they were linked or even installed against.

===Front-ends for locally compiled packages===
System administrators may install and maintain software using tools other than package management software. For example, a local administrator may download unpackaged source code, compile it, and install it. This may cause the state of the local system to fall out of synchronization with the state of the package manager&#x27;s database. The local administrator will be required to take additional measures, such as manually managing some dependencies or integrating the changes into the package manager.

There are tools available to ensure that locally compiled packages are integrated with the package management. For distributions based on .deb and .rpm files as well as Slackware Linux, there is CheckInstall, and for recipe-based systems such as Gentoo Linux and hybrid systems such as Arch Linux, it is possible to write a recipe first, which then ensures that the package fits into the local package database.

===Maintenance of configuration===
Particularly troublesome with software upgrades are upgrades of configuration files. Since package managers, at least on Unix systems, originated as extensions of file archiving utilities, they can usually only either overwrite or retain configuration files, rather than applying rules to them. There are exceptions to this that usually apply to kernel configuration (which, if broken, will render the computer unusable after a restart). Problems can be caused if the format of configuration files changes; for instance, if the old configuration file does not explicitly disable new options that should be disabled. Some package managers, such as Debian&#x27;s dpkg, allow configuration during installation. In other situations, it is desirable to install packages with the default configuration and then overwrite this configuration, for instance, in headless installations to a large number of computers. This kind of pre-configured installation is also supported by dpkg.

===Repositories===
To give users more control over the kinds of software that they are allowing to be installed on their system (and sometimes due to legal or convenience reasons on the distributors&#x27; side), software is often downloaded from a number of software repositories.

===Upgrade suppression===
When a user interacts with the package management software to bring about an upgrade, it is customary to present the user with the list of actions to be executed (usually the list of packages to be upgraded, and possibly giving the old and new version numbers), and allow the user to either accept the upgrade in bulk, or select individual packages for upgrades. Many package managers can be configured to never upgrade certain packages, or to upgrade them only when critical vulnerabilities or instabilities are found in the previous version, as defined by the packager of the software. This process is sometimes called &quot;version pinning&quot;.

For instance:
*yum supports this with the syntax &quot;exclude=openoffice*&quot;
*pacman with &quot;IgnorePkg= openoffice&quot; (to suppress upgrading openoffice in both cases)
*dpkg and dselect support this partially through the &quot;hold&quot; flag in package selections
*APT extends the &quot;hold&quot; flag through the complex &quot;pinning&quot; mechanism (Users can also blacklist a package)
*aptitude has &quot;hold&quot; and &quot;forbid&quot; flags
*portage supports this through the package.mask configuration file
===Cascading package removal===
Some of the more advanced package management features offer &quot;cascading package removal&quot;, in which all packages that depend on the target package and all packages that only the target package depends on, are also removed.

===Comparison of commands===
Although the commands are specific for every particular package manager, they are to a large extent translatable, as most package managers offer similar functions.

The Arch Linux Pacman/Rosetta wiki offers an extensive overview.

==Prevalence==
Package managers like dpkg have existed as early as 1994.

Linux distributions oriented to binary packages rely heavily on package management systems as their primary means of managing and maintaining software. Mobile operating systems such as Android (Linux-based) and iOS (Unix-based) rely almost exclusively on their respective vendors&#x27; app stores and thus use their own dedicated package management systems.

==Comparison with installers==
A package manager is often called an &quot;install manager&quot;, which can lead to a confusion between package managers and installers. The differences include:

==Comparison with build automation utility==
Most software configuration management systems treat building software and deploying software as separate, independent steps.
A build automation utility typically takes human-readable source code files already on a computer, and automates the process of converting them into a binary executable package on the same or remote computer.
Later a package manager typically running on some other computer downloads those pre-built binary executable packages over the internet and installs them.

However, both kinds of tools have many commonalities:
*The dependency graph topological sorting used in a package manager to handle dependencies between binary components is also used in a build manager to handle the dependency between source components.
*Many makefiles support not only building executables, but also installing them with codice_1.
*Every package manager for a source-based distribution Portage, Sorcery, Homebrew, etc. supports converting human-readable source code to binary executables and installing it.

A few tools, such as Maak and A-A-P, are designed to handle both building and deployment, and can be used as either a build automation utility or as a package manager or both.

== Comparison with app stores ==

&quot;App stores&quot; can also be considered application-level package managers (without the ability to install all levels of programs). Unlike traditional package managers, app stores are designed to enable payment for the software itself (instead of for software development), and may only offer monolithic packages with no dependencies or dependency resolution. They are usually extremely limited in their management functionality, due to a strong focus on simplification over power or emergence, and common in commercial operating systems and locked-down “smart” devices.

Package managers also often have only human-reviewed code. Many app stores, such as Google Play and Apple&#x27;s App Store, screen apps mostly using automated tools only; malware with defeat devices can pass these tests, by detecting when the software is being automatically tested and delaying malicious activity. There are, however, exceptions; the npm package database, for instance, relies entirely on post-publication review of its code, while the Debian package database has an extensive human review process before any package goes into the main stable database. The XZ Utils backdoor used years of trust-building to insert a backdoor, which was nonetheless caught while in the testing database.

==Common package managers and formats==

===Universal package manager===
Also known as binary repository manager, it is a software tool designed to optimize the download and storage of binary files, artifacts and packages used and produced in the software development process. These package managers aim to standardize the way enterprises treat all package types. They give users the ability to apply security and compliance metrics across all artifact types. Universal package managers have been referred to as being at the center of a DevOps toolchain.

===Package formats===

Each package manager relies on the format and metadata of the packages it can manage. That is, package managers need groups of files to be bundled for the specific package manager along with appropriate metadata, such as dependencies. Often, a core set of utilities manages the basic installation from these packages and multiple package managers use these utilities to provide additional functionality.

For example, yum relies on rpm as a backend. Yum extends the functionality of the backend by adding features such as simple configuration for maintaining a network of systems. As another example, the Synaptic Package Manager provides a graphical user interface by using the Advanced Packaging Tool (apt) library, which, in turn, relies on dpkg for core functionality.

Alien is a program that converts between different Linux package formats, supporting conversion between Linux Standard Base (LSB) compliant .rpm packages, .deb, Stampede (.slp), Solaris (.pkg) and Slackware (.tgz, .txz, .tbz, .tlz) packages.

In mobile operating systems, Google Play consumes Android application package (APK) package format while Microsoft Store uses APPX and XAP formats. (Both Google Play and Microsoft Store have eponymous package managers.)

===Free and open source software systems===
By the nature of free and open source software, packages under similar and compatible licenses are available for use on a number of operating systems. These packages can be combined and distributed using configurable and internally complex packaging systems to handle many permutations of software and manage version-specific dependencies and conflicts. Some packaging systems of free and open source software are also themselves released as free and open source software. One typical difference between package management in proprietary operating systems, such as Mac OS X and Windows, and those in free and open source software, such as Linux, is that free and open source software systems permit third-party packages to also be installed and upgraded through the same mechanism, whereas the package managers of Mac OS X and Windows will only upgrade software provided by Apple and Microsoft, respectively (with the exception of some third party drivers in Windows). The ability to continuously upgrade third-party software is typically added by adding the URL of the corresponding repository to the package management&#x27;s configuration file.

===Application-level package managers===
Beside the system-level application managers, there are some add-on package managers for operating systems with limited capabilities and for programming languages in which developers need the latest libraries.

Unlike system-level package managers, application-level package managers focus on a small part of the software system. They typically reside within a directory tree that is not maintained by the system-level package manager, such as or . However, this might not be the case for the package managers that deal with programming libraries, leading to a possible conflict as both package managers may claim to &quot;own&quot; a file and might break upgrades.

===Data Dependency Management===
In 2016, Edgard Marx, a computer scientist from Leipzig University, coined the term Data Dependency Management to refer to the systems that deal with the management of data.
Data Dependency Management systems are designed to facilitate the deployment and management of data on the cloud, personal computers, or smart devices (edge). Data Dependency Management frameworks can be used to describe how the data was conceived, licensing as well as its dependencies. The concept of data dependency management comes from software package dependency management tools such as npm for JavaScript, gem for Ruby, and NuGet for .NET. Their rationale is to allow users to manage the software dependency on data, such as machine learning models for data-driven applications. They are useful to publish, locate, and install data packages. A typical example of a data dependency management frameworks are Hugging Face, KBox, among others.

==Impact==
Ian Murdock had commented that package management is &quot;the single biggest advancement Linux has brought to the industry&quot;, that it blurs the boundaries between operating system and applications, and that it makes it &quot;easier to push new innovations [...] into the marketplace and [...] evolve the OS&quot;.

There is also a conference for package manager developers known as PackagingCon. It was established in 2021 with the aim to understand different approaches to package management.

<text>The London Internet Exchange (LINX) is an Internet exchange point (IXP) providing peering to over 950 different autonomous systems (ASNs). Established in 1994 in London, LINX operates IXPs in London, Manchester, Scotland, and Wales in the United Kingdom, as well as in Northern Virginia, United States.

Founded by a consortium of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and educational networks, LINX is a founding member of Euro-IX, a Europe-wide alliance of Internet exchanges. It is one of the largest neutral IXPs in Europe by average throughput.

LINX functions as a non-profit organization, structured as a company limited by guarantee. Membership involves signing a memorandum of understanding, with each member collectively owning the company. All members hold a single vote at Annual General Meetings (AGMs) and Extraordinary General Meetings (EGMs) on issues related to finances, the constitution, and the scope of LINX activities. The members periodically elect the non-executive board of directors and convene at regular meetings to discuss technical, corporate governance, and regulatory matters. LINX operates under a mandate to avoid direct competition with its members.

==History==
In November 1994, using a donated piece of equipment no bigger than a video recorder and without any written contracts, five UK-based Internet service providers (ISPs) linked their networks to exchange data and avoid paying high transatlantic bandwidth costs.

LINX effectively began when two ISPs (PIPEX and UK Net) linked their networks via a 64-kilobit serial link to save the cost and time delay involved in routing data across the Atlantic to US Internet exchanges.

When Demon Internet, UKERNA – the UK academic network – and other ISPs showed interest in establishing similar serial links, Keith Mitchell, then chief technical officer of PIPEX, initiated a meeting with BT to discuss the creation of a London-based Internet exchange.

PIPEX provided the LINX founders with a Cisco Catalyst 1200 switch with eight 10-megabit ports. Rack space was leased at a then virtually empty data center operated by Telehouse International Corporation of Europe Ltd at Coriander Avenue in London&#x27;s Dockland.

Switching the first data through the Telehouse hub was accomplished by primarily technical specialists who were unconcerned about the formalities of legal contracts. However, while PIPEX continued to provide administrative and technical oversight, the need for a formal constitution was eventually recognized.

The solution was to form a company limited by guarantee. Lawyers produced a draft memorandum and constitution which was extensively modified by members. The company was formed in 1995, and a board of five non-executive directors was elected, with Keith Mitchell as the initial chairman.

===Not for profit organization===
From the beginning, it was agreed that LINX would be a non-profit organization run for the benefit of members and governed collectively through regular member meetings, a practice which continues to this day.

While PIPEX continued to provide administrative oversight – charged at cost to LINX – member meetings were held every two months (now every three months) to decide strategic direction. Eventually, it was accepted that the purely co-operative system of operation at LINX was becoming overly demanding. Then, in late 1996, Keith Mitchell accepted the role of full-time chairman, working with a personal assistant from offices in Peterborough.

In the summer of 1996, LINX became the first Internet exchange in the world to deploy a 100-megabit switch – a Cisco Catalyst 5000. In January 1999, it pioneered the implementation of a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) running over gigabit Ethernet connections.

As the Internet grew in popularity, legislators and law enforcement agencies began to call for its regulation. LINX increasingly found itself taking on non-core activities, such as providing expert advice on behalf of its members (and, therefore, the whole industry) to a wide range of official agencies.

In 1999, LINX appointed its first full-time regulation officer in Roland Perry to advise organizations such as the Home Office Internet Task Force, the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit, the Department of Trade and Industry and relevant departments of the EU Commission. In 2003, Roland was succeeded by Malcolm Hutty when Roland left to form his own advisory group.

LINX also actively and financially supports the Internet Watch Foundation which, since 1996, has worked to eradicate child abuse images from the UK Internet. Initial funding from LINX was instrumental in enabling the IWF to launch and the decision to create the IWF and define its charter was taken at a LINX member meeting in Heathrow.

===LINX in the twenty-first century===
2000 – A training manager was appointed to introduce an accredited training program for Internet engineers and technicians.

2001 – LINX amended its corporate structure to make the post of chairman non-executive and appointed its first chief executive officer, John Souter, previously UK managing director of German-owned Varieties Communications.

2002 – LINX was the first exchange to introduce 10G Ethernet operation, using equipment from Foundry Networks – in fact, the second of their worldwide customers to deploy their technology.

2003 – This year saw the launch of the &#x27;LINX from Anywhere&#x27; service, a facility that permits smaller ISPs to piggyback on the networks of existing members to obtain a secure, virtual presence on the LINX exchange without incurring the manpower and Rackspace costs of having their own installation in London.

2004 – LINX considerably expanded its footprint, with four new points of presence (Pop&#x27;s) – all in the Docklands area of London.

2005 – LINX members voted to make public affairs one of the company&#x27;s &quot;core functions&quot;, placing it on an equal footing with peering and interconnection.

2006 – LINX membership reached 200.

2008 – LINX expanded again opening three new PoPs, this time adding considerably to the geographical diversity by doing so in the City of London, North Acton and Slough. It also heralded new relationships with data centre operators, with the addition of Interxion and Equinix (to the pre-existing ones of Telehouse and Telecity).

2011 – The LINX primary LAN was redesigned to a VPLS-based infrastructure with a new vendor, Juniper Networks.

2012 – The Connection reseller Programme launched. Also this year LINX became the first Internet exchange in the world to install a Juniper PTX5000 in a live network and the exchange opened its first site outside London in Manchester (IX Manchester).

2013 – Two additional local exchanges, IX Scotland in Edinburgh and LINX NOVA in North Virginia, USA, were launched. They were the exchange&#x27;s first sites outside England.

2014 – Another local exchange, IX Cardiff in Wales, was launched.

2016 – Sees the introduction of new hardware and a restructuring of LON2 with hardware from EdgeCore Networks

2017 – Following the passage of the Investigatory Powers Act, a new constitution was proposed which would ban directors from reporting the installation of surveillance equipment to members. This caused dissension among members, many of which are non-UK based ISPs operating from countries where mass surveillance is, like in the UK, not legal. This interpretation of the constitutional change was disputed on the official LINX website. Voting on the constitutional revision took place during a hastily called Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) on 21 February; although a majority supported the change the number attending was too small for the motion to be carried.

2021 – LINX reported a record level of UK Traffic at 6.05 Tbit/s.

2022 – LINX joined the long list of organizations supporting Ukraine by disconnecting Russian services from its networks.

==Technology==
In London, LINX operates two physically separate networks, or switching platforms, on different architectures using equipment from different manufacturers (Extreme Networks and Juniper Networks). These networks are deployed over ten locations, each connected by multiple 100 Gigabit Ethernet or 10 Gigabit Ethernet connections over fibre networks.

The LINX Engineering team restructured its secondary LAN in London, LON2, in 2018 using software and hardware from two different suppliers.

LINX data center facilities are found at sixteen locations throughout London, including:

*Telehouse North
*Telehouse North 2
*Telehouse East
*Telehouse West
*Equinix Harbour Exchange (ex. TeleCity)
* Digital Realty, Bonnington House, Millharbour (ex. TeleCity)
*Digital Realty, Sovereign House, Marsh Wall (ex. TeleCity)
* Equinix Powergate, Acton
*Equinix, Slough
*Interxion London City
*Virtus, Hayes (Transmission PoP)
*Colt Data Centre, London West (Transmission PoP)

Connecting is also possible from remote locations via the &#x27;LINX from Anywhere&#x27; scheme via a range of layer 2 service/MPLS carriers.

Redundancy of the network is managed using rapid-failover protection mechanisms such a VPLS service over an MPLS core (MPLS/VPLS) from Juniper and Extreme&#x27;s Ethernet Automatic Protection System (EAPS). These restore connectivity within tenths of a second in the event of the loss of a network segment.

In addition to the main peering infrastructure, LINX provides managed private interconnections (via Single Mode Fiber) between LINX members, and works with a number of fibre carriers to provide rapid connection between LINX members for private circuits. These PI circuits may be used for any purpose, but are mainly intended for Private Peering arrangements between members. Private Peering is sometimes more appropriate for managing large flows of traffic between ISPs and/or Content Providers.

Telehouse hosts the vast majority of internet peering traffic from LINX.

==Public affairs==
One of LINX&#x27;s core functions is to represent its members in matters of public policy. LINX&#x27;s Public Affairs department works to obtain advance warning of public policy developments that could affect LINX members, to inform members about important policy developments at a time when it is still possible to influence them, and to educate, inform and influence regulators and legislators.

At the UK level, LINX liaises directly with policymakers on matters such as content regulation, telecoms regulation, privacy and data protection, e-mail spam, online fraud/phishing, law enforcement, counter-terrorism, and any other topics that affect LINX members.

At the European level, LINX is an active member of Euro ISPA and works with Euro ISPA&#x27;s other national associations to influence European policy.

LINX also works actively with partner organizations such as the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) and the Internet Society (ISOC). LINX was instrumental in the creation of the Internet Watch Foundation, the UK hotline for reporting and removing child sexual abuse material from the Internet, and continues to advise the IWF as a member of its Funding Council.

As a mutual, membership-based organization, all of LINX&#x27;s public affairs activity is informed and guided by extensive and ongoing consultation with LINX members.

==Local exchanges==

===LINX Manchester===
Launched in April 2012 IX Manchester, now known as LINX Manchester was initially a single-site platform based on a stand-alone Brocade BigIron RX-16 switch, repurposed from the primary LAN in London. A new design extends the network to two new sites – M247&#x27;s Ice Colo &amp; Joule House and brings in completely new hardware from Extreme Networks.

The new network will be configured as an EAPS protected ring, topology currently used for the secondary LINX LAN in London. All sites will use a Summit X670v switch, capable of connecting 48x10 Gb member ports. Telecity Williams will also have a smaller Summit X460 switch for terminating slower ports.

The links between sites will be provisioned on a dark fibre provided by NTL and lit by LINX with the use of SFP+ DWDM transceivers and passive DWDM MUX units. Initial ISL capacity will be configured at 20 Gbit/s but easily upgradeable to 80 Gbit/s if required.

===LINX Scotland===
Located in Pulsant&#x27;s South Gyle data center in Edinburgh (formerly Scolocate), IX Scotland, now known as LINX Scotland, was officially launched in November 2013. The site will use the latest hardware from Extreme Networks enabling all the advanced features expected from a modern exchange.

===LINX Wales===
Located in BT&#x27;s Stadium House data center in Cardiff. IX Cardiff, then LINX Cardiff, now known as LINX Wales was officially launched on 15 October 2014 in an effort to decentralize UK internet traffic.

As of July 2018, LINX Wales has a typical peak of 0.9976 Gbit/s of network traffic with a maximum peak of 1.03 Gbit/s as of 1 December 2017.

===LINX NOVA===
Following discussions with the US network community, and its own members, LINX decided to launch an open peering exchange in North America in late 2013. Formally to be known as LINX NoVA, the exchange will be closely aligned with, and endorsed by, the newly formed Open-IX, using systems and processes that have proved successful in Europe and the wider world for nearly 20 years.

Based in the North Virginia/Washington DC area, LINX NoVA initially spanned three data centers – Evo Switch in Manassas, Digital Realty in Ashburn and Coresite in Reston – and will be connected using dark fiber lit by LINX. An agreement for a fourth Colo site, also in Ashburn, is expected shortly.

The LINX NOVA exchange will use MX960 router equipment from Juniper Networks capable of delivering 100G member ports from launch with the three PoPs all connected by diverse dark fiber lit by LINX.

LINX NoVA will be developed in the same way as the LINX primary LAN in London (VPLS, separated core and edge, etc.) but as a stand-alone site not requiring a connection to the LANs operated in the London, UK.

==Other activities==
LINX also carries on a number of non-core activities (NCAPs) from time to time, for example the LINX Accredited Internet Technician (LAIT) training Program.

Other services provided include a time service using atomic clocks, as well as hosting for other &quot;Good of the Internet&quot; services including various Internet statistics projects, numerous secondary name servers for various ccTLD domains, and instances of the F, K and I root nameservers.

Latest news for 2018/19 sees LINX launch an IXP partner relationship with Japan IX allowing customers to connect to LINX in London and also LINX and Saudi Telecom Company (STC), on 7 December 2018 marked the start of JED-IX driven by LINX, an Internet exchange in Jeddah (JED-IX), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).

<text>The painter&#x27;s algorithm (also depth-sort algorithm and priority fill) is an algorithm for visible surface determination in 3D computer graphics that works on a polygon-by-polygon basis rather than a pixel-by-pixel, row by row, or area by area basis of other Hidden-Surface Removal algorithms. The painter&#x27;s algorithm creates images by sorting the polygons within the image by their depth and placing each polygon in order from the farthest to the closest object.

The painter&#x27;s algorithm was initially proposed as a basic method to address the Hidden-surface determination problem by Martin Newell, Richard Newell, and Tom Sancha in 1972, while all three were working at CADCentre. The name &quot;painter&#x27;s algorithm&quot; refers to the technique employed by many painters where they begin by painting distant parts of a scene before parts that are nearer, thereby covering some areas of distant parts. Similarly, the painter&#x27;s algorithm sorts all the polygons in a scene by their depth and then paints them in this order, farthest to closest. It will paint over the parts that are normally not visible — thus solving the visibility problem — at the cost of having painted invisible areas of distant objects. The ordering used by the algorithm is called a &quot;&#x27;depth order&#x27;&quot; and does not have to respect the numerical distances to the parts of the scene: the essential property of this ordering is, rather, that if one object obscures part of another, then the first object is painted after the object that it obscures. Thus, a valid ordering can be described as a topological ordering of a directed acyclic graph representing occlusions between objects.

== Algorithm ==
Conceptually Painter&#x27;s Algorithm works as follows:

# Sort each polygon by depth
# Place each polygon from the farthest polygon to the closest polygon

=== Pseudocode ===
 sort &quot;polygons&quot; by &quot;depth&quot;
 for each &quot;polygon&quot; &quot;p&quot;:
 for each &quot;pixel&quot; that &quot;p&quot; covers:
 paint &quot;p.color&quot; on &quot;pixel&quot;

=== Time complexity ===
The painter&#x27;s algorithm&#x27;s time-complexity depends on the sorting algorithm used to order the polygons. Assuming an optimal sorting algorithm, painter&#x27;s algorithm has a worst-case complexity of &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n + m*n&quot;), where &quot;n&quot; is the number of polygons and &quot;m&quot; is the number of pixels to be filled.

=== Space complexity ===
The painter&#x27;s algorithm&#x27;s worst-case space-complexity is &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n+m&quot;), where &quot;n&quot; is the number of polygons and &quot;m&quot; is the number of pixels to be filled.

== Advantages ==
There are two primary technical requisites that favor the use of the painter&#x27;s algorithm.

=== Basic graphical structure ===
The painter&#x27;s algorithm is not as complex in structure as its other depth sorting algorithm counterparts. Components such as the depth-based rendering order, as employed by the painter&#x27;s algorithm, are one of the simplest ways to designate the order of graphical production. This simplicity makes it useful in basic computer graphics output scenarios where an unsophisticated render will need to be made with little struggle. 

=== Memory efficiency ===
In the early 70s, when the painter&#x27;s algorithm was developed, physical memory was relatively small. This required programs to manage memory as efficiently as possible to conduct large tasks without crashing. The painter&#x27;s algorithm prioritizes the efficient use of memory but at the expense of higher processing power since all parts of all images must be rendered.

== Limitations ==

The algorithm can fail in some cases, including cyclic overlap or piercing polygons.

=== Cyclical overlapping ===
In the case of cyclic overlap, as shown in the figure to the right, Polygons A, B, and C overlap each other in such a way that it is impossible to determine which polygon is above the others. In this case, the offending polygons must be cut to allow sorting.

=== Piercing polygons ===
The case of piercing polygons arises when one polygon intersects another. Similar to cyclic overlap, this problem may be resolved by cutting the offending polygons.

=== Efficiency ===
In basic implementations, the painter&#x27;s algorithm can be inefficient. It forces the system to render each point on every polygon in the visible set, even if that polygon is occluded in the finished scene. This means that, for detailed scenes, the painter&#x27;s algorithm can overly tax the computer hardware.

== Variants ==

=== Extended painter&#x27;s algorithm ===
Newell&#x27;s algorithm, proposed as the extended algorithm to painter&#x27;s algorithm, provides a method for cutting cyclical and piercing polygons.

=== Reverse painter&#x27;s algorithm ===
Another variant of painter&#x27;s algorithm includes reverse painter&#x27;s algorithm. Reverse painter&#x27;s algorithm paints objects nearest to the viewer first — with the rule that paint must never be applied to parts of the image that are already painted (unless they are partially transparent). In a computer graphic system, this can be very efficient since it is not necessary to calculate the colors (using lighting, texturing, and such) for parts of a distant scene that are hidden by nearby objects. However, the reverse algorithm suffers from many of the same problems as the standard version.

== Other computer graphics algorithms ==
The flaws of painter&#x27;s algorithm led to the development of Z-buffer techniques, which can be viewed as a development of the painter&#x27;s algorithm by resolving depth conflicts on a pixel-by-pixel basis, reducing the need for a depth-based rendering order. Even in such systems, a variant of the painter&#x27;s algorithm is sometimes employed. As Z-buffer implementations generally rely on fixed-precision depth-buffer registers implemented in hardware, there is scope for visibility problems due to rounding error. These are overlaps or gaps at joints between polygons. To avoid this, some graphics engines implement &quot;over-rendering&quot;, drawing the affected edges of both polygons in the order given by the painter&#x27;s algorithm. This means that some pixels are actually drawn twice (as in the full painter&#x27;s algorithm), but this happens on only small parts of the image and has a negligible performance effect.

<doc id="47029" wikidata="Q947544" url="?curid=47029" title="Scanline rendering">
<text>Scanline rendering (also scan line rendering and scan-line rendering) is an algorithm for visible surface determination, in 3D computer graphics, that works on a row-by-row basis rather than a polygon-by-polygon or pixel-by-pixel basis. All of the polygons to be rendered are first sorted by the top y coordinate at which they first appear, then each row or scan line of the image is computed using the intersection of a scanline with the polygons on the front of the sorted list, while the sorted list is updated to discard no-longer-visible polygons as the active scan line is advanced down the picture.

The main advantage of this method is that sorting vertices along the normal of the scanning plane reduces the number of comparisons between edges. Another advantage is that it is not necessary to translate the coordinates of all vertices from the main memory into the working memory—only vertices defining edges that intersect the current scan line need to be in active memory, and each vertex is read in only once. The main memory is often very slow compared to the link between the central processing unit and cache memory, and thus avoiding re-accessing vertices in main memory can provide a substantial speedup.

This kind of algorithm can be easily integrated with many other graphics techniques, such as the Phong reflection model or the Z-buffer algorithm.

==Algorithm==

The usual method starts with edges of projected polygons inserted into buckets, one per scanline; the rasterizer maintains an active edge table (&quot;AET&quot;). Entries maintain sort links, X coordinates, gradients, and references to the polygons they bound. To rasterize the next scanline, the edges no longer relevant are removed; new edges from the current scanlines&#x27; Y-bucket are added, inserted sorted by X coordinate. The active edge table entries have X and other parameter information incremented. Active edge table entries are maintained in an X-sorted list, effecting a change when 2 edges cross. After updating edges, the active edge table is traversed in X order to emit only the visible spans, maintaining a Z-sorted active Span table, inserting and deleting the surfaces when edges are crossed.

==Variants==

A hybrid between this and Z-buffering does away with the active edge table sorting, and instead rasterizes one scanline at a time into a Z-buffer, maintaining active polygon spans from one scanline to the next.

In another variant, an ID buffer is rasterized in an intermediate step, allowing deferred shading of the resulting visible pixels.

==History==

The first publication of the scanline rendering technique was probably by Wylie, Romney, Evans, and Erdahl in 1967.

Other early developments of the scanline rendering method were by Bouknight in 1969, and Newell, Newell, and Sancha in 1972. Much of the early work on these methods was done in Ivan Sutherland&#x27;s graphics group at the University of Utah, and at the Evans &amp; Sutherland company in Salt Lake City.

==Use in realtime rendering==

The early Evans &amp; Sutherland ESIG line of image-generators (IGs) employed the technique in hardware &#x27;on the fly&#x27;, to generate images one raster-line at a time without a framebuffer, saving the need for then costly memory. Later variants used a hybrid approach.

The Nintendo DS is the latest hardware to render 3D scenes in this manner, with the option of caching the rasterized images into VRAM.

The sprite hardware prevalent in 1980s games machines can be considered a simple 2D form of scanline rendering.

The technique was used in the first Quake engine for software rendering of environments (but moving objects were Z-buffered over the top). Static scenery used BSP-derived sorting for priority. It proved better than Z-buffer/painter&#x27;s type algorithms at handling scenes of high depth complexity with costly pixel operations (i.e. perspective-correct texture mapping without hardware assist). This use preceded the widespread adoption of Z-buffer-based GPUs now common in PCs.

Sony experimented with software scanline renderers on a second Cell processor during the development of the PlayStation 3, before settling on a conventional CPU/GPU arrangement.

==Similar techniques==
A similar principle is employed in tiled rendering (most famously the PowerVR 3D chip); that is, primitives are sorted into screen space, then rendered in fast on-chip memory, one tile at a time. The Dreamcast provided a mode for rasterizing one row of tiles at a time for direct raster scanout, saving the need for a complete framebuffer, somewhat in the spirit of hardware scanline rendering.

Some software rasterizers use &#x27;span buffering&#x27; (or &#x27;coverage buffering&#x27;), in which a list of sorted, clipped spans are stored in scanline buckets. Primitives would be successively added to this datastructure, before rasterizing only the visible pixels in a final stage.

==Comparison with Z-buffer algorithm==

The main advantage of scanline rendering over Z-buffering is that the number of times visible pixels are processed is kept to the absolute minimum which is always one time if no transparency effects are used—a benefit for the case of high resolution or expensive shading computations.

In modern Z-buffer systems, similar benefits can be gained through rough front-to-back sorting (approaching the &#x27;reverse painters algorithm&#x27;), early Z-reject (in conjunction with hierarchical Z), and less common deferred rendering techniques possible on programmable GPUs.

Scanline techniques working on the raster have the drawback that overload is not handled gracefully.

The technique is not considered to scale well as the number of primitives increases. This is because of the size of the intermediate datastructures required during rendering—which can exceed the size of a Z-buffer for a complex scene.

Consequently, in contemporary interactive graphics applications, the Z-buffer has become ubiquitous. The Z-buffer allows larger volumes of primitives to be traversed linearly, in parallel, in a manner friendly to modern hardware. Transformed coordinates, attribute gradients, etc., need never leave the graphics chip; only the visible pixels and depth values are stored.

<text>Lucius Cornelius Cinna (before 130 BC – early 84 BC) was a four-time consul of the Roman republic. Opposing Sulla&#x27;s march on Rome in 88 BC, he was elected to the consulship of 87 BC, during which he engaged in an armed conflict – the Bellum Octavianum – with his co-consul, Gnaeus Octavius. Emerging victorious, Cinna initiated with his ally, Gaius Marius, the murders of their enemies. In the aftermath, he dominated the republic for the next three years, serving continuously as consul.

While his domination was not complete – he largely contented himself with securing the consulship for himself and allies – his political rule set a &quot;crucial precedent&quot; for later strongmen in the republic. Through 85 and 84 BC, he prepared for civil war with Sulla, who was soon to return from the First Mithridatic War. When trying to ferry his men across the Adriatic at Ancona early in 84 BC, they mutinied and Cinna was killed.

Cinna was born some time before 130 BC into a patrician family that was not recently distinguished. Theodor Mommsen considered the Cornelii Cinnae to be plebeians, but most modern authors view them as patricians. His father may have been consul in 127 BC.

He married a woman named Annia, with whom he had three children: two daughters and one homonymous son. His eldest daughter married Gaius Julius Caesar (the dictator and consul of 59 BC), probably during Cinna&#x27;s second consulship in 86 BC; his younger daughter married Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (who died in 81 BC). Cinna&#x27;s homonymous son escaped Sulla&#x27;s retribution by fleeing to Quintus Sertorius – one of Cinna&#x27;s legates – after Sulla&#x27;s civil war, before being given amnesty in the &quot;lex Plautia&quot; and returning to Rome. Afterwards, he became praetor in 44 BC.

Before 90 BC, Cinna must have served as praetor. It is known that he also served during the Social War; T.R.S. Broughton believed Cinna was one of the legates who led the successful Roman offensive against the Marsi during the war in 89 BC. Little is known of Cinna&#x27;s life or career before his election as consul.

== First consulship, 87 BC ==

=== Electoral context ===
In 88 BC, there were two major questions in Roman politics. The first was the Italian question. During the Social War, the Roman republic had granted basically all the Italian allies Roman citizenship. Publius Sulpicius Rufus, a plebeian tribune, sought to curry their favour by enrolling them equally into the thirty-five tribes (voting units); in this, he was opposed by politicians who wished to pack the numerous Italians into a limited number of existing – or eight newly-created – tribes. The other question was one of command. Mithridates VI Eupator, king of Pontus, had recently invaded the province of Asia. The commander of the Roman response would have a great opportunity to become wealthy and influential from the plunder and glory of the war.

Sulpicius attempted to link the two matters by securing transfer of then-consul Lucius Cornelius Sulla&#x27;s command against Mithridates to the aged general Gaius Marius in exchange for Marius&#x27; support for Italian enrolment. But after he passed the legislation transferring Sulla&#x27;s command to Marius, Sulla suborned his army into marching on Rome to overturn Sulpicius&#x27; actions. After doing so, he invalidated Sulpicius&#x27; laws and banished twelve men, Sulpicus and Marius included. Sulla justified his actions by claiming that as consul he had a duty to free the state from dangerous demagogues. He also may have passed legislation in 88 BC to change the Roman constitution by reducing the powers and legislative initiative of the plebeian tribunes; however, some scholars have suggested these reforms are retrojections of Sulla&#x27;s later actions as dictator. Sulla&#x27;s reasons and putative reforms notwithstanding, his march on Rome was the subject of deep and broad revulsion at the elections.

One of Cinna&#x27;s goals during his consulship was holding Sulla legally responsible for his march on Rome; he promised that if elected he would have Sulla prosecuted at the expiration of his term. Sulla did not support Cinna and instead put forward Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus, an ally who had recently celebrated a triumph. The &quot;comitia&quot;, still indignant over Sulla&#x27;s march and treatment of Sulpicius and Marius, rejected Sulla&#x27;s candidate and elected Cinna with Gnaeus Octavius as his colleague instead. The two &quot;consules designati&quot; may have, at the time, been friends. Before the results were officially announced, Sulla realised they would be personally unfavourable; seeking not to interfere in the elections directly, he instead tried for a religious solution to protect his actions. Before he declared the winners, he first induced Cinna and Octavius to swear not to overturn Sulla&#x27;s arrangements publicly. The consuls-designate did so because Sulla as presiding consul had the power to refuse announcement of the winners and invalidate the results. While Octavius seemed to take the oath seriously, Cinna did not.

=== War on Octavius ===
==== Expulsion ====
Cinna&#x27;s first act as consul was to have a plebeian tribune prosecute Sulla, possibly for his killing of Sulpicius, who when killed had been a serving and sacrosanct plebeian tribune. This was meant to stop Sulla from leaving Italy at the head of an army, strip him of his &quot;imperium&quot;, and deprive him of his Mithridatic command. It was, however, unenforceable: Sulla ignored the tribunician summons and departed with his army for Greece.

According to Appian, Cinna accepted bribes to support the equal enrolment of the new Italian citizens into the thirty-five tribes. Bribed or not, Cinna declared publicly his support for such enrolment, which brought him immediately into conflict with his co-consul Octavius. Both Cinna and Octavius&#x27; partisans quickly armed themselves. Attempts by Cinna to promulgate legislation to distribute the new citizens into the tribes were met by tribunician vetoes backed by Octavius, leading to a riot against the tribunes. A &quot;senatus consultum ultimum&quot; then may have been moved against the rioters; Octavius quickly executed it, taking his hastily armed supporters down the &quot;via Sacra&quot; and killing the rioters.

Cinna was unharmed and left the city with some of his major supporters, including Quintus Sertorius, Gaius Milonius, Marcus Marius Gratidianus, and six of the ten tribunes of the plebs. After his departure for Italian towns to raise men and money, the Senate illegally and unconstitutionally stripped Cinna of his consulship and declared him a public enemy (&quot;hostis&quot;), electing Lucius Cornelius Merula (also the flamen Dialis) in his place. Due to Merula&#x27;s priestly duties and taboos, Octavius served as &quot;de facto&quot; sole consul.

==== March on Rome ====
Cinna reached Nola, an Italian town still holding against Roman siege, where he appeared before the army stationed there in consular regalia. He addressed them as a mistreated consul who had been unjustly deprived of a gift of the people by the senate, who thereby made a mockery of popular sovereignty. The army raised him up and declared their support. Cinna then administered an oath of loyalty for the officers and men. Following this, he travelled around Italian towns saying that he needed their support and that he had been attacked for his pro-Italian advocacy. Octavius and Merula acted to fortify the city.

Gaius Marius, one of the Sullan exiles, returned to Italy and pledged his loyalty to Cinna. Cinna acknowledged Marius as proconsul but Marius scrupulously refused the title before drumming up support among the Italians and returning to Cinna&#x27;s camp with some 6,000 men. The Senate and Octavius had ordered Pompey Strabo – a commander in the northern theatre of the Social war – to return to Rome and defend the city with his army. Encamped outside the city, he was not prepared to commit for either side before treating with both of them. Cinna&#x27;s forces then arrived and besieged the city. He led the main force opposite the Colline Gate, with two detachments under Sertorius and Marius on the north and south of the city, respectively. Strabo eventually sided with Octavius; the Senate, seeking support, also ordered Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius, who was in the field against the Samnites, to make an honourable peace immediately and return to defend the city.

When Metellus negotiated with the Samnites, they demanded citizenship for themselves and all those who had fled to them, release of all war prisoners, and non-reciprocal return of all plunder. Metellus and the Senate refused; Cinna and Marius seized the opportunity and offered the concessions, gaining the Samnites as allies. After one of the military tribunes in Rome defected and opened the gates to the Janiculum, Cinna and Marius&#x27; forces moved to storm the city; they were stopped by six cohorts from Strabo&#x27;s army. Strabo, seeking to leverage his military forces into a second consulship, initiated secret negotiations with Cinna but soon died of plague. Extending the siege, Cinna&#x27;s forces fanned out across the countryside and cut Rome&#x27;s food supply. The Senate then sent envoys to Cinna to negotiate a truce. Initially put off by Cinna&#x27;s demand that they address him as consul, the Senate acquiesced on this point after Merula abdicated his consulship.

==== Extra-legal killings ====
The envoys secured a promise from Cinna that he would not willingly kill anyone but his ally Marius silently stood behind his chair. Cinna then entered the city and promulgated a law recalling Marius and the Sullan exiles. A squadron of his cavalry, led by Gaius Marcius Censorinus killed the consul Octavius, who had refused to flee. Censorinus then presented the consul&#x27;s head to Cinna; this was the first time a consul&#x27;s head was displayed as a prize to another Roman.

Cinna and Marius then moved to purge some of their political opponents, Gaius and Lucius Julius Caesar were killed without trial, along with Publius Licinius Crassus and Marcus Antonius. Merula – the recently-abdicated suffect consul – and Marius&#x27; old rival, Quintus Lutatius Catulus, were brought up on trial before the people, possibly for usurpation of the consulship and &quot;perduellio&quot;, respectively; they committed suicide before the verdict.

The killings were not broad across the political class and likely reflected Marius&#x27; grudges; nor were the victims then linked to Sulla. There is no evidence that the purge targeted the victim&#x27;s families. While later sources – including Dio, Velleius, Livy, Diodorus, and Plutarch – claim that Cinna and Marius butchered and ravaged their way through the city for five days, these claims are likely Sullan propaganda filtered through Sulla&#x27;s memoirs. Cicero, more contemporaneous and speaking to men who lived during the Cinnan regime, indicates that Cinna and Marius targeted only political enemies and did not threaten all of Rome&#x27;s inhabitants or otherwise sack the city.

== &quot;Dominatio&quot; and death ==
When he returned to the city he dominated public affairs and took measures against Sulla. Sulla was declared &quot;hostis&quot; and stripped of his priesthood. His property was confiscated, his house demolished, and his legislation repealed. His wife and children fled the city for the protection of Sulla&#x27;s army in Greece. At elections in late 87 BC, Cinna had himself and Marius elected as consuls – contrary to some ancient sources, an electoral comitia was likely held, just the two were the only candidates – for 86 BC. Marius, though, died just thirteen days after assuming his seventh consulship, possibly of pneumonia. In Marius&#x27; place, Cinna elevated Lucius Valerius Flaccus. During 86 BC, a census was conducted by Lucius Marcius Philippus and Marcus Perperna. Although Cinna supported the registration of the Italians as citizens, the number counted in that year – just 463,000 – indicates most of the newly enfranchised Italians were yet unregistered. Flaccus, Cinna&#x27;s co-consul, also brought and passed legislation reducing all outstanding debts by three quarters.

At the close of the year, Flaccus departed for Greece, ostensibly to assume command over a leaderless army – Sulla&#x27;s command had officially been vacated because he was declared an outlaw – but was soon assassinated by one of his legates, Gaius Flavius Fimbria, who then assumed command. Sulla eventually drove Mithridates from Asia and secured a peace, the Treaty of Dardanos, with generous terms for Pontus by 85 BC. He also suborned Fimbria&#x27;s army in the east, causing Fimbria to commit suicide.

For the year 85 BC, Cinna chose Gnaeus Papirius Carbo as his consular colleague. Sulla&#x27;s peace with Pontus, widely regarded as generous so to give Sulla a free hand against his enemies in Italy, and other actions in Asia indicated that he would return in arms. Cinna and Carbo responded by immediately beginning military preparations and a propaganda campaign. They stockpiled money and provisions from all of Italy while levying men and giving warnings that Sulla would, if victorious, overturn Italian enfranchisement. The warnings, given Sulla&#x27;s violent action against Sulpicius in 88 BC, seemed legitimate.

Late in 85 BC, Sulla sent a letter to the Senate in Rome reciting his achievements in the Mithridatic war and complaining against the regime in Rome. He then promised that he would avenge himself upon those enemies in the name of his murdered friends, his exiled family and Rome. Against Cinna&#x27;s claims, he also asserted he had no intention to overturn Italian enfranchisement. The Senate responded to the letter by dispatching an embassy to Sulla to try to reconcile him with his political opponents. The Senate also instructed Cinna and Carbo stop military preparations; they agreed to do so but ignored the Senate and continued recruiting. Cinna&#x27;s strategy seems to have been to force their way east into Greece and fight Sulla there.

Cinna and Carbo continued in office as consuls for 84 BC; early in that year, Cinna started to embark his men across the Adriatic to Liburnia, in the northern Adriatic, meaning that Cinna was not intending to challenge Sulla in Greece. When transiting the Adriatic, the first set of ships transited safely. But the second set encountered a storm. Some of the ships sank and many men deserted, saying they were unwilling to fight fellow citizens. The remaining men waiting to depart at Ancona then refused to embark. Appian reports that when Cinna called an assembly, he attempted to impose discipline, which culminated in his men mutinying and killing him. Plutarch delivers a different story centring around soldiers fearing that Cinna had assassinated the then-young Pompey; this story, however, is not credible. After his death, his co-consul Carbo was recalled to Rome hold elections for his replacement, but after two attempts to hold elections received bad omens, the elections were indefinitely postponed and Carbo held office without colleague for the rest of the year.

The Senate&#x27;s envoys brought news of Cinna&#x27;s death to Sulla. Sulla then rejected the Senate&#x27;s offers, refused to disband his army, and demanded that the Senate restore his legal status, property, and offices. Sulla&#x27;s rejection of terms was met poorly. Eventually, Sulla invaded Italy in 83 BC, triggering a civil war, in which he was eventually victorious, the next year.

== Assessment ==

The &quot;dominatio Cinnae&quot; is not well documented. According to Robin Seager, in the &quot;Cambridge Ancient History&quot;, &quot;assessment [of it] is rendered painfully difficult by the way in which our scrappy sources are pervaded by the insidious influence of Sulla&#x27;s own version of events, diffused without competition after his victory&quot; in the civil war. Cinna and his faction, however, were the first to transform force into political domination. Their methods did not accord with republican principles, setting a precedent later followed by Sulla, Caesar, and Octavian.

The short length and partial nature of his &quot;dominatio&quot; – Cinna seems only to have wanted to be consul every year – have made it difficult to develop a clear assessment of his politics or character. Previous scholarship and ancient narratives, which painted Cinna as an appendage to Marius, are now largely rejected. He was competent at using &quot;popularis&quot;-style argumentation but had no diagnoses for the republic&#x27;s more structural flaws.

His support for Italian enfranchisement and distribution among the thirty-five tribes was opportunistic and he only haltingly followed through on his Italian promises once entrenched in power. After the initial wave of killings with Marius in 86 BC, there are no signs of extra-legal persecutions. The nature of politics during his &quot;dominatio&quot; was relatively traditional though the consul and the Senate acted largely independently and were also largely willing to ignore the other. While there must have been resentment over Cinna&#x27;s monopolisation of the consulship, the political class in Rome during his consulships was largely not personally threatened and left alone.

<doc id="47037" wikidata="Q233573" url="?curid=47037" title="Offa of Mercia">
<text>Offa (born &quot;circa&quot; 730, died 29 July 796 AD) was King of Mercia, a kingdom of Anglo-Saxon England, from 757 until his death in 796. The son of Thingfrith and a descendant of Eowa, Offa came to the throne after a period of civil war following the assassination of Æthelbald. Offa defeated the other claimant, Beornred. In the early years of Offa&#x27;s reign, it is likely that he consolidated his control of Midland peoples such as the Hwicce and the Magonsæte. Taking advantage of instability in the kingdom of Kent to establish himself as overlord, Offa also controlled Sussex by 771, though his authority did not remain unchallenged in either territory. In the 780s he extended Mercian Supremacy over most of southern England, allying with Beorhtric of Wessex, who married Offa&#x27;s daughter Eadburh, and regained complete control of the southeast. He also became the overlord of East Anglia and had King Æthelberht II of East Anglia beheaded in 794, perhaps for rebelling against him.

Offa was a Christian king who came into conflict with the Church, particularly with Jænberht, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Offa persuaded Pope Adrian I to divide the archdiocese of Canterbury in two, creating a new archdiocese of Lichfield. This reduction in the power of Canterbury may have been motivated by Offa&#x27;s desire to have an archbishop consecrate his son Ecgfrith as king, since it is possible Jænberht refused to perform the ceremony, which took place in 787. Offa had a dispute with the Bishop of Worcester, which was settled at the Council of Brentford in 781.

Many surviving coins from Offa&#x27;s reign carry elegant depictions of him, and the artistic quality of these images exceeds that of the contemporary Frankish coinage. Some of his coins carry images of his wife, Cynethryth—the only Anglo-Saxon queen ever depicted on a coin. Only three gold coins of Offa&#x27;s have survived: one is a copy of an Abbasid dinar of 774 and carries Arabic text on one side, with &quot;Offa Rex&quot; on the other. The gold coins are of uncertain use but may have been struck to be used as alms or for gifts to Rome.

Many historians regard Offa as the most powerful Anglo-Saxon king before Alfred the Great. His dominance never extended to Northumbria, though he gave his daughter Ælfflæd in marriage to the Northumbrian king Æthelred I in 792. Historians once saw his reign as part of a process leading to a unified England, but this is no longer the majority view: in the words of historian Simon Keynes, &quot;Offa was driven by a lust for power, not a vision of English unity; and what he left was a reputation, not a legacy.&quot; His son Ecgfrith succeeded him after his death, but reigned for less than five months before Coenwulf of Mercia became king.

==Background and sources==
In the first half of the 8th century, the dominant Anglo-Saxon ruler was King Æthelbald of Mercia, who by 731 had become the overlord of all the provinces south of the River Humber. Æthelbald was one of a number of strong Mercian kings who ruled from the mid-7th century to the early 9th, and it was not until the reign of Egbert of Wessex in the 9th century that Mercian power began to wane.

The power and prestige that Offa attained made him one of the most significant rulers in early medieval Britain, though no contemporary biography of him survives. A key source for the period is the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, a collection of annals in Old English narrating the history of the Anglo-Saxons. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; was a West Saxon production, however, and is sometimes thought to be biased in favour of Wessex; hence it may not accurately convey the extent of power achieved by Offa, a Mercian. That power can be seen at work in charters dating from Offa&#x27;s reign. Charters were documents which granted land to followers or to churchmen and were witnessed by the kings who had the authority to grant the land. A charter might record the names of both a subject king and his overlord on the witness list appended to the grant. Such a witness list can be seen on the Ismere Diploma, for example, where Æthelric, son of king Oshere of the Hwicce, is described as a &quot;subregulus&quot;, or subking, of Æthelbald&#x27;s. The eighth-century monk and chronicler the Venerable Bede wrote a history of the English church called ; the history only covers events up to 731, but as one of the major sources for Anglo-Saxon history it provides important background information for Offa&#x27;s reign.

Offa&#x27;s Dyke, most of which was probably built in his reign, is a testimony to the extensive resources Offa had at his command and his ability to organise them. Other surviving sources include a problematic document known as the Tribal Hidage, which may provide further evidence of Offa&#x27;s scope as a ruler, though its attribution to his reign is disputed. A significant corpus of letters dates from the period, especially from Alcuin, an English deacon and scholar who spent over a decade at Charlemagne&#x27;s court as one of his chief advisors, and corresponded with kings, nobles and ecclesiastics throughout England. These letters in particular reveal Offa&#x27;s relations with the continent, as does his coinage, which was based on Carolingian examples.

==Ancestry and family==
Offa&#x27;s ancestry is given in the Anglian collection, a set of genealogies that include lines of descent for four Mercian kings. All four lines descend from Pybba, who ruled Mercia early in the 7th century. Offa&#x27;s line descends through Pybba&#x27;s son Eowa and then through three more generations: Osmod, Eanwulf and Offa&#x27;s father, Thingfrith. Æthelbald, who ruled Mercia for most of the forty years before Offa, was also descended from Eowa according to the genealogies: Offa&#x27;s grandfather, Eanwulf, was Æthelbald&#x27;s first cousin. Æthelbald granted land to Eanwulf in the territory of the Hwicce, and it is possible that Offa and Æthelbald were from the same branch of the family. In one charter Offa refers to Æthelbald as his kinsman, and Headbert, Æthelbald&#x27;s brother, continued to witness charters after Offa rose to power.

Offa&#x27;s wife was Cynethryth, whose ancestry is unknown. The couple had a son, Ecgfrith, and at least three daughters: Ælfflæd, Eadburh and Æthelburh. It has been speculated that Æthelburh was the abbess who was a kinswoman of King Ealdred of the Hwicce, but there are other prominent women named Æthelburh during that period.

==Early reign, the midland territories and the Middle and East Saxons==
Æthelbald, who had ruled Mercia since 716, was assassinated in 757. According to a later continuation of Bede&#x27;s &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; (written anonymously after Bede&#x27;s death) the king was &quot;treacherously murdered at night by his own bodyguards&quot;, though the reason why is unrecorded. Æthelbald was initially succeeded by Beornred, about whom little is known. The continuation of Bede comments that Beornred &quot;ruled for a little while, and unhappily&quot;, and adds that &quot;the same year, Offa, having put Beornred to flight, sought to gain the kingdom of the Mercians by bloodshed.&quot; It is possible that Offa did not gain the throne until 758, however, since a charter of 789 describes Offa as being in the thirty-first year of his reign.
The conflict over the succession suggests that Offa needed to re-establish control over Mercia&#x27;s traditional dependencies, such as the Hwicce and the Magonsæte. Charters dating from the first two years of Offa&#x27;s reign show the Hwiccan kings as &quot;reguli&quot;, or kinglets, under his authority; and it is likely that he was also quick to gain control over the Magonsæte, for whom there is no record of an independent ruler after 740. Offa was probably able to exert control over the kingdom of Lindsey at an early date, as it appears that the independent dynasty of Lindsey had disappeared by this time.

Little is known about the history of the East Saxons during the 8th century, but what evidence there is indicates that both London and Middlesex, which had been part of the kingdom of Essex, were finally brought under Mercian control during the reign of Æthelbald. Both Æthelbald and Offa granted land in Middlesex and London as they wished; in 767 a charter of Offa&#x27;s disposed of land in Harrow without a local ruler as witness. It is likely that both London and Middlesex were quickly under Offa&#x27;s control at the start of his reign. The East Saxon royal house survived the 8th century, so it is probable that the kingdom of Essex retained its native rulers, but under strong Mercian influence, for most or all of the 8th century.

It is unlikely that Offa had significant influence in the early years of his reign outside the traditional Mercian heartland. The overlordship of the southern English which had been exerted by Æthelbald appears to have collapsed during the civil strife over the succession, and it is not until 764, when evidence emerges of Offa&#x27;s influence in Kent, that Mercian power can be seen expanding again.

==Kent and Sussex==
Offa appears to have exploited an unstable situation in Kent after 762. Kent had a long tradition of joint kingship, with east and west Kent under separate kings, though one king was typically dominant. Prior to 762 Kent was ruled by Æthelberht II and Eadberht I; Eadberht&#x27;s son Eardwulf is also recorded as a king. Æthelberht died in 762, and Eadberht and Eardwulf are last mentioned in that same year. Charters from the next two years mention other kings of Kent, including Sigered, Eanmund and Heahberht. In 764, Offa granted land at Rochester in his own name, with Heahberht on the witness list as king of Kent. Another king of Kent, Ecgberht, appears on a charter in 765 along with Heahberht; the charter was subsequently confirmed by Offa. Offa&#x27;s influence in Kent at this time is clear, and it has been suggested that Heahberht was installed by Offa as his client. There is less agreement among historians on whether Offa had general overlordship of Kent thereafter. He is known to have revoked a charter of Ecgberht&#x27;s on the grounds that &quot;it was wrong that his thegn should have presumed to give land allotted to him by his lord into the power of another without his witness&quot;, but the date of Ecgberht&#x27;s original grant is unknown, as is the date of Offa&#x27;s revocation of it. It may be that Offa was the effective overlord of Kent from 764 until at least 776. The limited evidence for Offa&#x27;s direct involvement in the kingdom between 765 and 776 includes two charters of 774 in which he grants land in Kent; but there are doubts about their authenticity, so Offa&#x27;s intervention in Kent prior to 776 may have been limited to the years 764–65.

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records that &quot;the Mercians and the inhabitants of Kent fought at Otford&quot; in 776, but does not give the outcome of the battle. It has traditionally been interpreted as a Mercian victory, but there is no evidence for Offa&#x27;s authority over Kent until 785: a charter from 784 mentions only a Kentish king named Ealhmund, which may indicate that the Mercians were in fact defeated at Otford. The cause of the conflict is also unknown: if Offa was ruling Kent before 776, the battle of Otford was probably a rebellion against Mercian control. However, Ealhmund does not appear again in the historical record, and a sequence of charters by Offa from the years 785–89 makes his authority clear. During these years he treated Kent &quot;as an ordinary province of the Mercian kingdom&quot;, and his actions have been seen as going beyond the normal relation of overlordship and extending to the annexation of Kent and the elimination of a local royal line. After 785, in the words of one historian, &quot;Offa was the rival, not the overlord, of Kentish kings&quot;. Mercian control lasted until 796, the year of Offa&#x27;s death, when Eadberht Præn was temporarily successful in regaining Kentish independence.

Ealhmund was probably the father of Egbert of Wessex, and it is possible that Offa&#x27;s interventions in Kent in the mid-780s are connected to the subsequent exile of Egbert to Francia. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; claims that when Egbert invaded Kent in 825, the men of the southeast turned to him &quot;because earlier they were wrongly forced away from his relatives&quot;. This is likely to be an allusion to Ealhmund, and may imply that Ealhmund had a local overlordship of the southeastern kingdoms. If so, Offa&#x27;s intervention was probably intended to gain control of this relationship and take over the dominance of the associated kingdoms.

The evidence for Offa&#x27;s involvement in the kingdom of Sussex comes from charters, and as with Kent there is no clear consensus among historians on the course of events. What little evidence survives that bears on Sussex&#x27;s kings indicates that several kings ruled at once, and it may never have formed a single kingdom. It has been argued that Offa&#x27;s authority was recognised early in his reign by local kings in western Sussex, but that eastern Sussex (the area around Hastings) submitted to him less readily. Symeon of Durham, a twelfth-century chronicler, records that in 771 Offa defeated &quot;the people of Hastings&quot;, which may record the extension of Offa&#x27;s dominion over the entire kingdom. However, doubts have been expressed about the authenticity of the charters which support this version of events, and it is possible that Offa&#x27;s direct involvement in Sussex was limited to a short period around 770–71. After 772, there is no further evidence of Mercian involvement in Sussex until c. 790, and it may be that Offa gained control of Sussex in the late 780s, as he did in Kent.

==East Anglia, Wessex and Northumbria==

In East Anglia, Beonna probably became king in about 758. Beonna&#x27;s first coinage predates Offa&#x27;s own, and implies independence from Mercia. Subsequent East Anglian history is quite obscure, but in 779 Æthelberht II became king, and was independent long enough to issue coins of his own. In 794, according to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, &quot;King Offa ordered King Æthelberht&#x27;s head to be struck off&quot;. Offa minted pennies in East Anglia in the early 790s, so it is likely that Æthelberht rebelled against Offa and was beheaded as a result. Accounts of the event have survived in which Aethelberht is killed through the machinations of Offa&#x27;s wife Cynethryth, but the earliest manuscripts in which these possibly legendary accounts are found date from the 11th and 12th centuries, and recent historians do not regard them with confidence. The legend also claims that Æthelberht was killed at Sutton St. Michael and buried to the south at Hereford, where his cult flourished, becoming at one time second only to Canterbury as a pilgrimage destination.

To the south of Mercia, Cynewulf came to the throne of Wessex in 757 and recovered much of the border territory that Æthelbald had conquered from the West Saxons. Offa won an important victory over Cynewulf at the Battle of Bensington (in Oxfordshire) in 779, reconquering some of the land along the Thames. No indisputably authentic charters from before this date show Cynewulf in Offa&#x27;s entourage, and there is no evidence that Offa ever became Cynewulf&#x27;s overlord. In 786, after the murder of Cynewulf, Offa may have intervened to place Beorhtric on the West Saxon throne. Even if Offa did not assist Beorhtric&#x27;s claim, it seems likely that Beorhtric to some extent recognised Offa as his overlord shortly thereafter. Offa&#x27;s currency was used across the West Saxon kingdom, and Beorhtric had his own coins minted only after Offa&#x27;s death. In 789, Beorhtric married Eadburh, a daughter of Offa; the &quot;Chronicle&quot; records that the two kings combined to exile Egbert to Francia for &quot;three years&quot;, adding that &quot;Beorhtric helped Offa because he had his daughter as his queen&quot;. Some historians believe that the &quot;Chronicle&quot;″s &quot;three years&quot; is an error, and should read &quot;thirteen years&quot;, which would mean Egbert&#x27;s exile lasted from 789 to 802, but this reading is disputed. Eadburh is mentioned by Asser, a 9th-century monk who wrote a biography of Alfred the Great: Asser says that Eadburh had &quot;power throughout almost the entire kingdom&quot;, and that she &quot;began to behave like a tyrant after the manner of her father&quot;. Whatever power she had in Wessex was no doubt connected with her father&#x27;s overlordship.

If Offa did not gain the advantage in Wessex until defeating Cynewulf in 779, it may be that his successes south of the river were a necessary prerequisite to his interventions in the south-east. In this view, Egbert of Kent&#x27;s death in about 784 and Cynewulf&#x27;s death in 786 were the events that allowed Offa to gain control of Kent and bring Beorhtric into his sphere of influence. This version of events also assumes that Offa did not have control of Kent after 764–65, as some historians believe.

Offa&#x27;s marital alliances extended to Northumbria when his daughter Ælfflæd married Æthelred I of Northumbria at Catterick in 792. However, there is no evidence that Northumbria was ever under Mercian control during Offa&#x27;s reign.

==Wales and Offa&#x27;s Dyke==

Offa was frequently in conflict with the various Welsh kingdoms. There was a battle between the Mercians and the Welsh at Hereford in 760, and Offa is recorded as campaigning against the Welsh in 778, 784 and 796 in the tenth-century &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot;.

The best known relic associated with Offa&#x27;s time is Offa&#x27;s Dyke, a great earthen barrier that runs approximately along the border between England and Wales. It is mentioned by the monk Asser in his biography of Alfred the Great: &quot;a certain vigorous king called Offa ... had a great dyke built between Wales and Mercia from sea to sea&quot;. The dyke has not been dated by archaeological methods, but most historians find no reason to doubt Asser&#x27;s attribution. Early names for the dyke in both Welsh and English also support the attribution to Offa. Despite Asser&#x27;s comment that the dyke ran &quot;from sea to sea&quot;, it is now thought that the original structure only covered about two-thirds of the length of the border: in the north it ends near Llanfynydd, less than from the coast, while in the south it stops at Rushock Hill, near Kington in Herefordshire, less than from the Bristol Channel. The total length of this section is about . Other earthworks exist along the Welsh border, of which Wat&#x27;s Dyke is one of the largest, but it is not possible to date them relative to each other and so it cannot be determined whether Offa&#x27;s Dyke was a copy of or the inspiration for Wat&#x27;s Dyke.

The construction of the dyke suggests that it was built to create an effective barrier and to command views into Wales. This implies that the Mercians who built it were free to choose the best location for the dyke. There are settlements to the west of the dyke that have names that imply they were English by the 8th century, so it may be that in choosing the location of the barrier the Mercians were consciously surrendering some territory to the native Britons. Alternatively, it may be that these settlements had already been retaken by the Welsh, implying a defensive role for the barrier. The effort and expense that must have gone into building the dyke are impressive, and suggest that the king who had it built (whether Offa or someone else) had considerable resources at his disposal. Other substantial construction projects of a similar date do exist, however, such as Wat&#x27;s Dyke and Danevirke, in what is now Germany as well as such sites as Stonehenge from millennia earlier. The dyke can be regarded in the light of these counterparts as the largest and most recent great construction of the preliterate inhabitants of Britain.

==Church==
Offa ruled as a Christian king, but despite being praised by Charlemagne&#x27;s advisor, Alcuin, for his piety and efforts to &quot;instruct [his people] in the precepts of God&quot;, he came into conflict with Jænberht, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Jænberht had been a supporter of Ecgberht II of Kent, which may have led to conflict in the 760s when Offa is known to have intervened in Kent. Offa rescinded grants made to Canterbury by Egbert, and it is also known that Jænberht claimed the monastery of Cookham, which was in Offa&#x27;s possession.

In 786 Pope Adrian I sent papal legates to England to assess the state of the church and provide canons (ecclesiastical decrees) for the guidance of the English kings, nobles and clergy. This was the first papal mission to England since Augustine had been sent by Pope Gregory the Great in 597 to convert the Anglo-Saxons. The legates were Bishop George of Ostia, and Theophylact, the bishop of Todi. They visited Canterbury first, and then were received by Offa at his court. Both Offa and Cynewulf, king of the West Saxons, attended a council where the goals of the mission were discussed. George then went to Northumbria, while Theophylact visited Mercia and &quot;parts of Britain&quot;. A report on the mission, sent by the legates to Pope Adrian, gives details of a council held by George in Northumbria, and the canons issued there, but little detail survives of Theophylact&#x27;s mission. After the northern council George returned to the south and another council was held, attended by both Offa and Jænberht, at which further canons were issued.

In 787, Offa succeeded in reducing the power of Canterbury through the establishment of a rival archdiocese at Lichfield. The issue must have been discussed with the papal legates in 786, although it is not mentioned in the accounts that have survived. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; reports a &quot;contentious synod&quot; in 787 at Chelsea, which approved the creation of the new archbishopric. It has been suggested that this synod was the same gathering as the second council held by the legates, but historians are divided on this issue. Hygeberht, already Bishop of Lichfield, became the new archdiocese&#x27;s first and only archbishop, and by the end of 788 he received the pallium, a symbol of his authority, from Rome. The new archdiocese included the sees of Worcester, Hereford, Leicester, Lindsey, Dommoc and Elmham; these were essentially the midland Anglian territories. Canterbury retained the sees in the south and southeast.

The few accounts of the creation of the new archbishopric date from after the end of Offa&#x27;s reign. Two versions of the events appear in the form of an exchange of letters between Coenwulf, who became king of Mercia shortly after Offa&#x27;s death, and Pope Leo III, in 798. Coenwulf asserts in his letter that Offa wanted the new archdiocese created out of enmity for Jænberht; but Leo responds that the only reason the papacy agreed to the creation was because of the size of the kingdom of Mercia. Both Coenwulf and Leo had their own reasons for representing the situation as they did: Coenwulf was entreating Leo to make London the sole southern archdiocese, while Leo was concerned to avoid the appearance of complicity with the unworthy motives Coenwulf imputed to Offa. These are therefore partisan comments. However, both the size of Offa&#x27;s territory and his relationship with Jænberht and Kent are indeed likely to have been factors in Offa&#x27;s request for the creation of the new archdiocese. Coenwulf&#x27;s version has independent support, with a letter from Alcuin to Archbishop Æthelheard giving his opinion that Canterbury&#x27;s archdiocese had been divided &quot;not, as it seems, by reasonable consideration, but by a certain desire for power&quot;. Æthelheard himself later said that the award of a pallium to Lichfield depended on &quot;deception and misleading suggestion&quot;.

Another possible reason for the creation of an archbishopric at Lichfield relates to Offa&#x27;s son, Ecgfrith of Mercia. After Hygeberht became archbishop, he consecrated Ecgfrith as king; the ceremony took place within a year of Hygeberht&#x27;s elevation. It is possible that Jænberht refused to perform the ceremony, and that Offa needed an alternative archbishop for that purpose. The ceremony itself is noteworthy for two reasons: it is the first recorded consecration of any English king, and it is unusual in that it asserted Ecgfrith&#x27;s royal status while his father was still alive. Offa would have been aware that Charlemagne&#x27;s sons, Pippin and Louis, had been consecrated as kings by Pope Adrian, and probably wished to emulate the impressive dignity of the Frankish court. Other precedents did exist: Æthelred of Mercia is said to have nominated his son Coenred as king during his lifetime, and Offa may have known of Byzantine examples of royal consecration.

Despite the creation of the new archdiocese, Jænberht retained his position as the senior cleric in the land, with Hygeberht conceding his precedence. When Jænberht died in 792, he was replaced by Æthelheard, who was consecrated by Hygeberht, now senior in his turn. Subsequently, Æthelheard appears as a witness on charters and presides at synods without Hygeberht, so it appears that Offa continued to respect Canterbury&#x27;s authority.

A letter from Pope Adrian to Charlemagne survives which makes reference to Offa, but the date is uncertain; it may be as early as 784 or as late as 791. In it Adrian recounts a rumour that had reached him: Offa had reportedly proposed to Charlemagne that Adrian should be deposed, and replaced by a Frankish pope. Adrian disclaims all belief in the rumour, but it is clear it had been a concern to him. The enemies of Offa and Charlemagne, described by Adrian as the source of the rumour, are not named. It is unclear whether this letter is related to the legatine mission of 786; if it predates it, then the mission might have been partly one of reconciliation, but the letter might well have been written after the mission.

Offa was a generous patron of the church, founding several churches and monasteries, often dedicated to St Peter. Among these was St Albans Abbey, which he probably founded in the early 790s. He also promised a yearly gift of 365 mancuses to Rome; a mancus was a term of account equivalent to thirty silver pennies, derived from Abbasid gold coins that were circulating in Francia at the time. Control of religious houses was one way in which a ruler of the day could provide for his family, and to this end Offa ensured (by acquiring papal privileges) that many of them would remain the property of his wife or children after his death. This policy of treating religious houses as worldly possessions represents a change from the early 8th century, when many charters showed the foundation and endowment of small minsters, rather than the assignment of those lands to laypeople. In the 770s, an abbess named Æthelburh (who may have been the same person as Offa&#x27;s daughter of that name) held multiple leases on religious houses in the territory of the Hwicce; her acquisitions have been described as looking &quot;like a speculator assembling a portfolio&quot;. Æthelburh&#x27;s possession of these lands foreshadows Cynethryth&#x27;s control of religious lands, and the pattern was continued in the early 9th century by Cwoenthryth, the daughter of King Coenwulf.

Either Offa or Ine of Wessex is traditionally supposed to have founded the Schola Saxonum in Rome, in what is today the Roman rione, or district, of Borgo. The Schola Saxonum took its name from the militias of Saxons who served in Rome, but it eventually developed into a hostelry for English visitors to the city.

==European connections==
Offa&#x27;s diplomatic relations with Europe are well documented, but appear to belong only to the last dozen years of his reign. In letters dating from the late 780s or early 790s, Alcuin congratulates Offa for encouraging education and greets Offa&#x27;s wife and son, Cynethryth and Ecgfrith. In about 789, or shortly before, Charlemagne proposed that his son Charles marry one of Offa&#x27;s daughters, most likely Ælfflæd. Offa countered with a request that his son Ecgfrith should also marry Charlemagne&#x27;s daughter Bertha: Charlemagne was outraged by the request, and broke off contact with Britain, forbidding English ships from landing in his ports. Alcuin&#x27;s letters make it clear that by the end of 790 the dispute was still not resolved, and that Alcuin was hoping to be sent to help make peace. In the end diplomatic relations were restored, at least partly by the agency of Gervold, the abbot of St Wandrille.

Charlemagne sought support from the English church at the council of Frankfurt in 794, where the canons passed in 787 at the Second Council of Nicaea were repudiated, and the heresies of two Spanish bishops, Felix and Elipandus, were condemned. In 796 Charlemagne wrote to Offa; the letter survives and refers to a previous letter of Offa&#x27;s to Charlemagne. This correspondence between the two kings produced the first surviving documents in English diplomatic history. The letter is primarily concerned with the status of English pilgrims on the continent and with diplomatic gifts, but it reveals much about the relations between the English and the Franks. Charlemagne refers to Offa as his &quot;brother&quot;, and mentions trade in black stones, sent from the continent to England, and cloaks (or possibly cloths), traded from England to the Franks. Charlemagne&#x27;s letter also refers to exiles from England, naming Odberht, who was almost certainly the same person as Eadberht Præn, among them. Egbert of Wessex was another refugee from Offa who took shelter at the Frankish court. It is clear that Charlemagne&#x27;s policy included support for elements opposed to Offa; in addition to sheltering Egbert and Eadberht he also sent gifts to Æthelred I of Northumbria.

Events in southern Britain to 796 have sometimes been portrayed as a struggle between Offa and Charlemagne, but the disparity in their power was enormous. By 796 Charlemagne had become master of an empire which stretched from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Hungarian Plain, and Offa and then Coenwulf were clearly minor figures by comparison.

==Government==
The nature of Mercian kingship is not clear from the limited surviving sources. There are two main theories regarding the ancestry of Mercian kings of this period. One is that descendants of different lines of the royal family competed for the throne. In the mid-7th century, for example, Penda had placed royal kinsmen in control of conquered provinces. Alternatively, it may be that a number of kin-groups with local power-bases may have competed for the succession. The sub-kingdoms of the Hwicce, the Tomsæte and the unidentified Gaini are examples of such power-bases. Marriage alliances could also have played a part. Competing magnates, those called in charters &quot;dux&quot; or &quot;princeps&quot; (that is, leaders), may have brought the kings to power. In this model, the Mercian kings are little more than leading noblemen. Offa seems to have attempted to increase the stability of Mercian kingship, both by the elimination of dynastic rivals to his son Ecgfrith, and the reduction in status of his subject kings, sometimes to the rank of ealdorman. He was ultimately unsuccessful, however; Ecgfrith only survived in power for a few months, and ninth-century Mercia continued to draw its kings from multiple dynastic lines.

There is evidence that Offa constructed a series of defensive &quot;burhs&quot;, or fortified towns; the locations are not generally agreed on but may include Bedford, Hereford, Northampton, Oxford and Stamford. In addition to their defensive uses, these &quot;burhs&quot; are thought to have been administrative centres, serving as regional markets and indicating a transformation of the Mercian economy away from its origins as a grouping of midland peoples. The &quot;burhs&quot; are forerunners of the defensive network successfully implemented by Alfred the Great a century later to deal with the Danish invasions. However, Offa did not necessarily understand the economic changes that came with the &quot;burhs&quot;, so it is not safe to assume he envisioned all their benefits. In 749, Æthelbald of Mercia had issued a charter that freed ecclesiastical lands from all obligations except the requirement to build forts and bridges—obligations which lay upon everyone, as part of the trinoda necessitas. Offa&#x27;s Kentish charters show him laying these same burdens on the recipients of his grants there, and this may be a sign that the obligations were being spread outside Mercia. These burdens were part of Offa&#x27;s response to the threat of &quot;the pagan seaman&quot;.

Offa issued laws in his name, but no details of them have survived. They are known only from a mention by Alfred the Great, in the preface to Alfred&#x27;s own law code. Alfred says that he has included in his code those laws of Offa, Ine of Wessex and Æthelberht of Kent which he found &quot;most just&quot;. The laws may have been an independent lawcode, but it is also possible that Alfred is referring to the report of the legatine mission in 786, which issued statutes that the Mercians undertook to obey.

==Coinage==

At the start of the 8th century, sceattas were the primary circulating coinage. These were small silver pennies, which often did not bear the name of either the moneyer or the king for whom they were produced. To contemporaries these were probably known as pennies, and are the coins referred to in the laws of Ine of Wessex. This light coinage (in contrast to the heavier coins minted later in Offa&#x27;s reign) can probably be dated to the late 760s and early 770s. A second, medium-weight coinage can be identified before the early 790s. These new medium-weight coins were heavier, broader and thinner than the pennies they replaced, and were prompted by the contemporary Carolingian currency reforms. The new pennies almost invariably carried both Offa&#x27;s name and the name of the moneyer from whose mint the coins came. The reform in the coinage appears to have extended beyond Offa&#x27;s own mints: the kings of East Anglia, Kent and Wessex all produced coins of the new heavier weight in this period.

Some coins from Offa&#x27;s reign bear the names of the archbishops of Canterbury, Jænberht and, after 792, Æthelheard. Jænberht&#x27;s coins all belong to the light coinage, rather than the later medium coinage. There is also evidence that coins were issued by Eadberht, who was Bishop of London in the 780s and possibly before. Offa&#x27;s dispute with Jænberht may have led him to allow Eadberht coining rights, which may then have been revoked when the see of Lichfield was elevated to an archbishopric.

The medium-weight coins often carry designs of high artistic quality, exceeding that of the contemporary Frankish currency. Coin portraits of Offa have been described as &quot;showing a delicacy of execution which is unique in the whole history of the Anglo-Saxon coinage&quot;. The depictions of Offa on the coins include a &quot;striking and elegant&quot; portrait showing him with his hair in voluminous curls, and another where he wears a fringe and tight curls. Some coins show him wearing a necklace with a pendant. The variety of these depictions implies that Offa&#x27;s die-cutters were able to draw on varied artistic sources for their inspiration.

Offa&#x27;s wife Cynethryth was the only Anglo-Saxon queen ever named or portrayed on coinage, in a remarkable series of pennies struck by the moneyer Eoba. These were probably derived from contemporary coins from the reign of the Byzantine emperor Constantine VI, who minted a series showing a portrait of his mother, the later Empress Irene, though the Byzantine coins show a frontal bust of Irene rather than a profile, and so cannot have been a direct model.

Around the time of Jænberht&#x27;s death and replacement with Æthelheard in 792–93, the silver currency was reformed a second time: in this &quot;heavy coinage&quot; the weight of the pennies was increased again, and a standardised non-portrait design was introduced at all mints. None of Jænberht&#x27;s or Cynethryth&#x27;s coins occur in this coinage, whereas all of Æthelheard&#x27;s coins are of the new, heavier weight.
There are also surviving gold coins from Offa&#x27;s reign. One is a copy of an Abbasid dinar struck in 774 by Caliph Al-Mansur, with &quot;Offa Rex&quot; inserted into three lines of arabic, which are inverted. The inscription is the shahadah, the Islamic declaration of faith, and reads &quot; الله‎ محمدرسول &quot; (&quot;Muḥammad rasūl Allāh&quot;) which translates as &quot;Muhammad, messenger [of] God&quot;. It is likely that the moneyer had no understanding of Arabic as the Arabic text is poorly reproduced. The coin may have been produced to trade with Islamic Spain; or it may be part of the annual payment of 365 mancuses that Offa promised to Rome. There are other Western copies of Abbasid dinars of the period, but it is not known whether they are English or Frankish. Two other English gold coins of the period survive, from two moneyers, Pendraed and Ciolheard: the former is thought to be from Offa&#x27;s reign but the latter may belong either to Offa&#x27;s reign or to that of Coenwulf, who came to the throne in 796. Nothing definite is known about their use, but they may have been struck to be used as alms.

Although many of the coins bear the name of a moneyer, there is no indication of the mint where each coin was struck. As a result, the number and location of mints used by Offa is uncertain. Current opinion is that there were four mints, in Canterbury, Rochester, East Anglia and London.

==Stature==
The title Offa used on most of his charters was &quot;rex Merciorium&quot;, or &quot;king of the Mercians&quot;, though this was occasionally extended to &quot;king of the Mercians and surrounding nations&quot;. Some of his charters use the title &quot;Rex Anglorum&quot;, or &quot;King of the English&quot;, and this has been seen as a sweeping statement of his power. There is debate on this point, however, as several of the charters in which Offa is named &quot;Rex Anglorum&quot; are of doubtful authenticity. They may represent later forgeries of the 10th century, when this title was standard for kings of England. The best evidence for Offa&#x27;s use of this title comes from coins, not charters: there are some pennies with inscribed, but it is not regarded as definite that this stood for &quot;Offa Rex Anglorum&quot;.

In &quot;Anglo-Saxon England&quot;, Stenton argued that Offa was perhaps the greatest king of the English kingdoms, commenting that &quot;no other Anglo-Saxon king ever regarded the world at large with so ... acute a political sense&quot;. Many historians regard Offa&#x27;s achievements as second only to Alfred the Great among the Anglo-Saxon kings. Offa&#x27;s reign has sometimes been regarded as a key stage in the transition to a unified England, but this is no longer the general view among historians in the field. In the words of Simon Keynes, &quot;Offa was driven by a lust for power, not a vision of English unity; and what he left was a reputation, not a legacy.&quot; It is now believed that Offa thought of himself as &quot;King of the Mercians&quot;, and that his military successes were part of the transformation of Mercia from an overlordship of midland peoples into a powerful and aggressive kingdom.

==Death and succession==
Offa died on 29 July 796, and may be buried in Bedford, though it is not clear that the &quot;Bedeford&quot; named in that charter was actually modern Bedford. In 1837 a Saxon coffin was unearthed in the graveyard of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Hemel Hempstead which bore an inscription that it held the &quot;ashes of King Offa of the Mercians&quot;.

He was succeeded by his son, Ecgfrith of Mercia, but according to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; Ecgfrith died after a reign of only 141 days. A letter written by Alcuin in 797 to a Mercian ealdorman named Osbert makes it apparent that Offa had gone to great lengths to ensure that his son Ecgfrith would succeed him. Alcuin&#x27;s opinion is that Ecgfrith &quot;has no died for his own sins; but the vengeance for the blood his father shed to secure the kingdom has reached the son. For you know very well how much blood his father shed to secure the kingdom on his son.&quot; It is apparent that in addition to Ecgfrith&#x27;s consecration in 787, Offa had eliminated dynastic rivals. This seems to have backfired, from the dynastic point of view, as no close male relatives of Offa or Ecgfrith are recorded, and Coenwulf, Ecgfrith&#x27;s successor, was only distantly related to Offa&#x27;s line.

<doc id="47062" wikidata="Q7270302" url="?curid=47062" title="Queen Elizabeth's School, Barnet">
<text>Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s School, Barnet is a boys&#x27; grammar school in Barnet, northern Greater London, which was founded in 1573 by Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, and others, in the name of Queen Elizabeth I.

It is consistently ranked as one of the most academically successful secondary schools in England, having topped A-level league tables for grammar schools for five consecutive years, as of 2016, and was chosen by the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; as &quot;State School of the Year&quot; in 2007. An Ofsted report published in January 2008 stated: &quot;It is held in very high regard by the vast majority of students and their parents, and rightly so.&quot; It has also been a Training school since April 2009 and has a specialism in Music.

== History ==
=== Foundation and location ===
The school was founded in 1573 by Queen Elizabeth I, petitioned by Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, and assisted by local alderman Edward Underne. Elizabeth I&#x27;s charter of 1573 describes the school&#x27;s purpose thus:

 Bringing up and instruction of boys and youth, to be brought up in grammar and other learning, and the same to continue for ever, and the said School for one Master and one Usher for ever to continue and remain and that there shall be for ever four-and-twenty discreet, honest governors 

The original Tudor building, known as Tudor Hall, was erected in 1577 opposite the Church of St John the Baptist on Wood Street, with money raised by the first governors of the school and by collections in London churches. It was repaired in 1597 and again in 1637. During the 17th century, further extensive repairs were carried out, in spite of a poor financial situation following the Civil War. Financial conditions became progressively more comfortable during the 18th century.

The trustees of Elizabeth Allen&#x27;s Charity, which had been established by her will dated 10 February 1725, gave financial assistance to save it from a state &quot;very ruinous and unfit for habitation&quot;. It then became a private boarding school. It was closed in 1872 and restored in 1874 with many additions. In 1885 a governor, H. E. Chetwynd Stapylton, bought a plot of land behind the Jesus Hospital, a building in Wood Street dating back to 1679; today the Stapylton Field stands in front of the main school building and is used for rugby and cricket.

As the number of pupils outgrew the capacity of Tudor Hall, so the school was transferred in 1932 to a new site in Queen&#x27;s Road, which backed on to the Stapylton Field. It was administered by the South Herts Division of Hertfordshire County Council, until 1965 when it became part of the borough of Barnet. In the 1960s, there were around 550 boys with 150 in the sixth form. Tudor Hall was completely restored in 1968 by the London Borough of Barnet, and is now part of Barnet and Southgate College.

Two plaques are located on the walls of the original school building, Tudor Hall. Inscribed on the stone plaque is: This is to commemorate the original school founded here by Queen Elizabeth and built in 1573. The school was removed in 1932 to new building in Queens Road, Barnet. This plaque was erected by the Visitors of Jesus Hospital Charity, the owners in 1952. A more recent blue plaque was erected by the London borough of Barnet which dictates: This Tudor Hall housed the free grammar school of Queen Elizabeth I who granted its charter in 1573.
===Grammar school reinstatement===
Under Eamonn Harris (Headmaster 1984 - 1999), who took over the school when earmarked for closure, it returned to its previous selective grammar school status in August 1994, having opted out of the London borough and become a grant-maintained school in 1989. Other schools in Greater London did this, and many became partially selective (up to 50%) at this time. In the 1990s it went on to become England&#x27;s top state school for A-levels.

The girls&#x27; school remained a comprehensive.

From 1999 to 2011, the headmaster was John Marincowitz, who commissioned the new Martin swimming pool, opened in 2006, the Shearly Hall, opened in 2009, and a library. In 2011 Neil Enright became the 40th headmaster, and the completion and use of the Queen&#x27;s library took place.

QE has been criticized by many current and former pupils for a very strict approach to discipline. In April 2000, this led a group of current and former pupils to create a website where they could talk about their experiences. This was known as &#x27;QE Boys: The Truth&#x27;. It gained more hits than the official website, and the school excluded three pupils for posting messages on it. The current system uses &#x27;bad notes&#x27; sent directly to parents via e-mail if a pupil repeatedly shows poor behaviour. If too many accumulate, the issue is referred to the pupil&#x27;s tutor and then to their year head.

==Culture and sports==
Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s School is divided into six houses, named after famous old boys, patrons and former teachers. They are Broughton, Harrisons&#x27;, Leicester, Pearce, Stapylton and Underne.

Rugby union, played during the winter and spring terms, is compulsory for boys in their first four years at the school, as are cross country running and most other school sports, which include orienteering, swimming, basketball, tennis, cricket, Eton fives and athletics. QE is well known for not playing football competitively against other schools, although it is occasionally played internally in friendly games and at lunchtimes. Students also take part in cross country runs semi-annually, at the start of the autumn and spring terms. A particularly muddy part of the cross-country route, suitably nicknamed the &#x27;Elephant Dip&#x27;, owing to its extreme depth in wet weather, links the Byng Road Open Space (Barnet RFC) and the north-west gate of the bottom fields, however there is also a paved route turning right from the gate and going down Byng Road towards the Open Space. Students regularly use the Barnet RFC&#x27;s fields (the Byng Road Open Space) which are a short run from the back field gate.

There is much competition in the summer term when frequent competitions between houses are held before the summer examinations begin in June, including the QE Sevens Tournament which takes place in the school for the U14s and U16s. It is normally held at the end of the Spring Term.

==A-level and essential skills assessments==
Boys usually choose four subjects to study at A-level, but may drop one, either voluntarily, or because it does not appear that they can continue with outstanding performance in the subject. These subjects can, liable to some controversy, only be chosen after receiving offers of study, commonly referred to as &#x27;recommendations&#x27;, in those particular subjects. Given the large number of students who achieve many, sometimes straight, grades 8 or 9 at GCSE, achieving an outstanding grade in a given subject at GCSE level is not sufficient to judge suitability for A-level. Instead, students must show that they have the &#x27;essential skills&#x27; required to thrive at A-level in the subjects. Once departments are confident that a student possesses the required &#x27;essential skills&#x27;, only then will they issue a recommendation. To judge this, criteria are set by each department which must be met either in regular end-of-topic tests during the GCSE course, or by &#x27;Essential Skills&#x27; tests which are sat exclusively to measure performance against these criteria. The majority of recommendations are issued to those who have met the criteria in November of year 11, but will have an opportunity to meet the criteria in further tests, often including the GCSE mock exams, to then get a recommendation in February.

==Founder&#x27;s Day Fête==
The Founder&#x27;s Day Fête, and the preceding service of celebration at St John the Baptist&#x27;s Church, Barnet, is held every year, regardless of weather, on the third Saturday in June, and celebrates the founding of the school in 1573.

==Kerala partnership==
QE Boys has formed a long-term partnership with a school in Kerala called the Sri Sathya Sai School, funded by the &#x27;Sathya Sai Appeal&#x27;.

==Academic excellence==
In 2007, QE came first in the A-level league table for state schools, and twelfth in the GCSE league table. In 2008 QE again topped the league table in A-level results and a record number of 37 pupils gained a place at Oxford and Cambridge.

In January 2014, Barrie Martin, Chairman of the QE Governing Body and the Friends of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s was awarded an MBE for &#x27;Services to Education&#x27;. Headmaster Neil Enright described Martin as: &#x27;an asset to QE in so many ways, combining a tireless work ethic with tremendous focus and an utterly reliable good nature&#x27;.

In 2016, QE came first in the A-level league tables for selective state (grammar) schools for the 5th year in a row, also coming sixth in the GCSE league tables for grammar schools. 2016 would make the eighth year in the past decade that the school achieved the top spot in the A-Level league tables, solidifying its position at the forefront of the modern British educational scene.

Crispin Bonham-Carter, a former television and film actor, has been assistant headteacher at the school since 2019.

==Other Information==
===Admissions procedure===
Admission to the school is strictly by academic selection, and boys may apply to join the school for Year 7. Roughly 3,600 applicants compete in a series of examinations to be awarded one of the 192 places offered annually, making places at the grammar school some of the most sought after and oversubscribed in the country.

Parents of boys not admitted to the school have protested against the school&#x27;s selective admissions policy. Sometimes this has been because the prospective boy&#x27;s parents have moved to the area assuming a place will be guaranteed, when this is not the case. The school was also on a list of schools breaching admissions laws in England. The Barnet education authority asked for an investigation by Her Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate.

=== Contribution requests ===
In 2014 it was reported that the school, despite not being of independent school status, was making regular requests to parents for &#x27;voluntary donations&#x27; in order to provide the facilities pupils needed, with parents contributing monthly, usually around £60. The school justified these requests by saying that state funding was not sufficient to provide a sound education and &quot;the polish for boys to go on to the best universities&quot;.

<doc id="47063" wikidata="Q739941" url="?curid=47063" title="Monarchy of the United Kingdom">
<text>The monarchy of the United Kingdom, commonly referred to as the British monarchy, is the form of government used by the United Kingdom by which a hereditary monarch reigns as the head of state, with their powers regulated by the British constitution. The term may also refer to the role of the royal family within the UK&#x27;s broader political structure. The monarch since 8 September 2022 is King Charles III, who ascended the throne on the death of Queen Elizabeth II, his mother.

The monarch and their immediate family undertake various official, ceremonial, diplomatic and representational duties. Although formally the monarch has authority over the governmentwhich is known as &quot;His/Her Majesty&#x27;s Government&quot;this power may only be used according to laws enacted in Parliament and within constraints of convention and precedent. In practice the monarch&#x27;s role, including that of Head of the Armed Forces, is limited to functions such as bestowing honours and appointing the prime minister, which are performed in a non-partisan manner. The UK Government has called the monarchy &quot;a unique soft power and diplomatic asset&quot;. The Crown also occupies a unique cultural role, serving as an unofficial brand ambassador for British interests and values abroad, increasing tourism at home, and promoting charities throughout civil society.

The British monarchy traces its origins from the petty kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England and early medieval Scotland, which consolidated into the kingdoms of England and Scotland by the 10th century. England was conquered by the Normans in 1066, after which Wales also gradually came under the control of Anglo-Normans. The process was completed in the 13th century when the Principality of Wales became a client state of the English kingdom. The Anglo-Normans also established the Lordship of Ireland. Meanwhile, Magna Carta began the process of reducing the English monarch&#x27;s political powers. In the 16th century, English and Scottish monarchs played a central role in what became the religious English Reformation and Scottish Reformation, and the English king became King of Ireland. Beginning in 1603, the English and Scottish kingdoms were ruled by a single sovereign. From 1649 to 1660, the tradition of monarchy was broken by the republican Commonwealth of England, which followed the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. Following the installation of William III and Mary II as co-monarchs in the Glorious Revolution, the Bill of Rights 1689, and its Scottish counterpart the Claim of Right Act 1689, further curtailed the power of the monarchy and excluded Catholics from succession to the throne. In 1707, the kingdoms of England and Scotland were merged to create the Kingdom of Great Britain, and in 1801, the Kingdom of Ireland joined to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

Beginning in the 16th century, the monarch was the nominal head of what came to be the vast British Empire, which covered a quarter of the world&#x27;s land area at its greatest extent in 1921. The title Emperor of India was added to the British monarch&#x27;s titles between 1876 and 1948. The Balfour Declaration of 1926 recognised the evolution of the Dominions of the Empire into separate, self-governing countries within a Commonwealth of Nations. Also in this period, the monarchy in Ireland eventually became limited to Northern Ireland. In the years after World War II, the vast majority of British colonies and territories became independent, effectively bringing the Empire to an end. George VI and his successors adopted the title Head of the Commonwealth as a symbol of the free association of its independent member states. The United Kingdom and fourteen other independent sovereign states that share the same person as their monarch are called Commonwealth realms. Although the monarch is shared, each country is sovereign and independent of the others, and the monarch has a different, specific, and official national title and style for each realm. Although the term is rarely used today, the fifteen Commonwealth realms are, with respect to their monarch, in personal union. The monarch is also head of state of the Crown Dependencies and the British Overseas Territories.

==Constitutional role==
In the uncodified Constitution of the United Kingdom, the monarch (exclusively referred to in legislation as &quot;the Sovereign&quot;, and styled &quot;His&quot; or &quot;Her Majesty&quot;) is the head of state. The monarch&#x27;s image is used to signify British sovereignty and government authoritytheir profile, for instance, appears on Bank of England notes and all British coins and their portrait in government buildings. The Sovereign is further both mentioned in and the subject of songs, loyal toasts, and salutes. &quot;God Save the King&quot; (or, alternatively, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;) is the British national anthem. Oaths of allegiance are made to the Sovereign and their lawful successors.

The monarch takes little direct part in government. The authority to use the sovereign&#x27;s formal powers is almost all delegated, either by statute or by convention, to ministers or officers of the Crown, or other public bodies. Thus the acts of state done in the name of the Crown, such as Crown Appointments, even if personally performed by the monarch, such as the King&#x27;s Speech and the State Opening of Parliament, depend upon decisions made elsewhere. In formal terms:
* Legislative power is exercised by the King, the House of Lords and the House of Commons acting together as the King-in-Parliament.
* Executive power is exercised by His Majesty&#x27;s Government, which comprises ministers, primarily the prime minister and the Cabinet, which is technically a committee of the Privy Council. They have the direction of the Armed Forces of the Crown, the Civil Service and other Crown Servants such as the Diplomatic and Secret Services.
* Judicial power is vested in the various judiciaries of the United Kingdom, which by constitution and statute are independent of the Government.
* The Church of England, of which the sovereign is the titular head, has its own legislative, judicial, and executive structures.
* Powers independent of government are legally granted to other public bodies by statute or Statutory Instrument such as an Order in Council, Royal commission or otherwise.

The sovereign&#x27;s role as a constitutional monarch is largely limited to non-partisan functions, such as granting honours. This role has been recognised since the 19th century. The constitutional writer Walter Bagehot identified the monarchy in 1867 as the &quot;dignified&quot; rather than the &quot;efficient&quot; part of government.

===Royal prerogative===

That part of the government&#x27;s executive authority which remains theoretically and nominally vested in the sovereign is known as the royal prerogative. The monarch acts within the constraints of convention and precedent, exercising prerogative powers only on the advice of ministers responsible to Parliament, often through the prime minister or Privy Council. In practice, prerogative powers are exercised only on the prime minister&#x27;s advice – the prime minister, and not the sovereign, has control. The monarch holds a weekly audience with the prime minister; no records of these audiences are taken and the proceedings remain fully confidential. The monarch may express his or her views, but, as a constitutional ruler, must ultimately accept the decisions of the prime minister and Cabinet, who by definition enjoy the confidence of the House of Commons. In Bagehot&#x27;s words: &quot;the sovereign has, under a constitutional monarchy ... three rights – the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn.&quot;

Although the royal prerogative is extensive and parliamentary approval is not formally required for its exercise, it is limited. Many Crown prerogatives have fallen out of use or have been permanently transferred to Parliament. For example, the sovereign cannot impose and collect new taxes; such an action requires the authorisation of an Act of Parliament. According to a parliamentary report, &quot;The Crown cannot invent new prerogative powers&quot;, and Parliament can override any prerogative power by passing legislation.

The royal prerogative includes the powers to appoint and dismiss ministers, regulate the civil service, issue passports, declare war, make peace, direct the actions of the military, and negotiate and ratify treaties, alliances, and international agreements. However, a treaty cannot alter the domestic laws of the United Kingdom; an Act of Parliament is necessary in such cases. The sovereign is the Head of the Armed Forces (the Royal Navy, the British Army, and the Royal Air Force), and accredits British High commissioners and ambassadors, and receives heads of missions from foreign states.

====Appointment of the prime minister====
The sovereign has the power to appoint the prime minister. In accordance with unwritten constitutional conventions, the monarch appoints the individual who commands the support of the House of Commons, usually the leader of a party or coalition that has a majority in that House. The prime minister takes office by attending the monarch in a private audience, and after &quot;kissing hands&quot; that appointment is immediately effective without any other formality or instrument. The sovereign also has the power to dismiss the prime minister, but the last time this power was exercised was in 1834, when William IV dismissed Lord Melbourne; since then, prime ministers have only left office upon their resignation, which they are expected to offer to the monarch upon losing their majority in the House of Commons.

While the sovereign also appoints and may dismiss every other Minister of the Crown, by convention they do so only on the recommendation of the prime minister. It is therefore the prime minister who controls the composition of the government. In practice, the prime minister will request a member of the government resign in preference to advising the monarch to dismiss them; such ministers are euphemistically described as &quot;leaving the government&quot;.

In a hung parliament where no party or coalition holds a majority, the monarch has an increased degree of latitude in choosing the individual likely to command the most support, though it would usually be the leader of the largest party. Since 1945, there have only been three hung parliaments. The first followed the February 1974 general election when Harold Wilson was appointed prime minister after Edward Heath resigned following his failure to form a coalition. Although Wilson&#x27;s Labour Party did not have a majority, they were the largest party. The second followed the May 2010 general election, in which the Conservatives (the largest party) and Liberal Democrats (the third-largest party) agreed to form the first coalition government since World War II. The third occurred shortly thereafter, in June 2017, when the Conservative Party lost its majority in a snap election, though the party remained in power as a minority government.

====Summons, prorogation and dissolution of Parliament====
The sovereign has the power to summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament. Each parliamentary session begins with the sovereign&#x27;s summons. The new parliamentary session is marked by the State Opening of Parliament, during which the monarch reads the speech from the throne in the chamber of the House of Lords, outlining the Government&#x27;s legislative agenda. Prorogation usually occurs about one year after a session begins, and formally concludes the session. Dissolution ends a parliamentary term, and is followed by a general election for all seats in the House of Commons. If not dissolved sooner, Parliaments are automatically dissolved after five years.

The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 temporarily removed the sovereign&#x27;s authority to dissolve Parliament; however, this power was restored by the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022. The sovereign&#x27;s power of prorogation was unaffected, which is a regular feature of the parliamentary calendar.

In 1950 the Monarch&#x27;s Private Secretary Sir Alan &quot;Tommy&quot; Lascelles, writing pseudonymously to &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper, asserted a constitutional convention: according to the Lascelles Principles, if a minority government asked to dissolve Parliament to call an early election to strengthen its position, the monarch could refuse and would do so under three conditions. When Harold Wilson requested a dissolution late in 1974, Queen Elizabeth II granted his request as Heath had already failed to form a coalition. The resulting general election gave Wilson a small majority. The monarch could in theory unilaterally dismiss the prime minister, but in practice, the prime minister&#x27;s term nowadays comes to an end only by electoral defeat, death, or resignation.

====Other royal prerogatives====

Before a bill passed by the legislative Houses can become law, royal assent (the monarch&#x27;s approval) is required. In theory, assent can either be granted (making the bill law) or withheld (vetoing the bill), but since 1708 assent has always been granted.

The sovereign has a similar relationship to the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland as to the government of the UK. The sovereign appoints the First Minister of Scotland on the nomination of the Scottish Parliament, and the First Minister of Wales on the nomination of the Senedd. In Scottish matters, the sovereign acts on the advice of the Scottish Government. However, as devolution is more limited in Wales, in Welsh matters the monarch acts on the advice of the prime minister and Cabinet of the United Kingdom. The sovereign can veto any law passed by the Northern Ireland Assembly, if it is deemed unconstitutional by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.

The sovereign is deemed the &quot;fount of justice&quot;; although the monarch does not personally rule in judicial cases, judicial functions are performed in his or her name. For instance, prosecutions are brought on the sovereign&#x27;s behalf, and courts derive their authority from the Crown. The common law holds that the sovereign &quot;can do no wrong&quot;, and so cannot be prosecuted for criminal offences. The Crown Proceedings Act 1947 allows civil lawsuits against the Crown in its public capacity (that is, lawsuits against the government), but not lawsuits against the monarch personally. The sovereign exercises the &quot;prerogative of mercy&quot;, which is used to pardon convicted offenders or reduce sentences.

The sovereign is the &quot;fount of honour&quot;, the source of all honours and dignities in the United Kingdom. The Crown creates all peerages, appoints members of the orders of chivalry, grants knighthoods and awards other honours. Although peerages and most other honours are granted on the advice of the prime minister, some honours are within the personal gift of the sovereign and are not granted on ministerial advice. The sovereign alone appoints members of the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle, the Royal Victorian Order and the Order of Merit.

=== Sovereign immunity ===

The sovereign is personally immune from criminal prosecution or arrest, as well as from civil actions, and their property is not subject to execution or foreclosure. The Crown, however, as distinct from the sovereign, can be the subject of proceedings for tort and contract since 1947.

There are more than 160 laws granting express immunity to the sovereign or their property in various respects. For example, the sovereign is exempt from anti-discrimination legislation and other workers&#x27; rights, health and safety, or pensions laws, as well as numerous taxes, and environmental inspectors cannot enter the sovereign&#x27;s property without permission.

==History==
===English monarchy===

Following Viking raids and settlement in the ninth century, the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex emerged as the dominant English kingdom. Alfred the Great secured Wessex, achieved dominance over western Mercia, and assumed the title &quot;King of the Anglo-Saxons&quot;. His grandson Æthelstan was the first king to rule over a unitary kingdom roughly corresponding to the present borders of England, though its constituent parts retained strong regional identities. The 11th century saw England become more stable, despite a number of wars with the Danes, which resulted in a Danish monarchy for one generation. The conquest of England in 1066 by William, Duke of Normandy, was crucial in terms of both political and social change. The new monarch continued the centralisation of power begun in the Anglo-Saxon period, while the feudal system continued to develop.

William was succeeded by two of his sons: William II, then Henry I. Henry made a controversial decision to name his daughter Matilda (his only surviving child) as his heir. Following Henry&#x27;s death in 1135, his nephew, Stephen, claimed the throne and took power with the support of most of the barons. Matilda challenged his reign; as a result, England descended into a period of disorder known as the Anarchy. Stephen maintained a precarious hold on power, but agreed to a compromise under which Matilda&#x27;s son Henry II would succeed him. Henry accordingly became the first Angevin king of England and the first monarch of the Plantagenet dynasty in 1154.

The reigns of most of the Angevin monarchs were marred by civil strife and conflicts between the monarch and the nobility. Henry II faced rebellions from his own sons, including the future monarchs Richard I and John, but nevertheless managed to expand his kingdom, forming what is retrospectively known as the Angevin Empire. Upon Henry&#x27;s death, his eldest surviving legitimate son Richard succeeded to the throne; Richard was absent from England for most of his reign, for he left to fight in the Crusades. He was killed whilst besieging a castle; John succeeded him. Arthur I, Duke of Brittany, son of John&#x27;s deceased elder brother Duke Geoffrey II and himself former heir of Richard, was dissatisfied but disappeared the following year after being captured by John in 1202; Arthur&#x27;s sister, Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany was placed under house arrest by John.

John&#x27;s reign was marked by conflict with the barons, particularly over the limits of royal power. In 1215, the barons coerced the king into issuing Magna Carta (Latin for &quot;Great Charter&quot;) to guarantee the rights and liberties of the nobility. Soon afterwards, further disagreements plunged England into a civil war known as the First Barons&#x27; War, and French Prince Louis also claimed the throne as Louis I with the support of the rebellious princes as John&#x27;s nephew-in-law. The war abruptly ended when John died in 1216, leaving the Crown to his nine-year-old son Henry III. Many rebellious lords also turned to support Henry III. In 1217, Louis was defeated and renounced the English throne. Eleanor&#x27;s claim was not upheld, but according to John&#x27;s will, she remained under house arrest until her death in 1241. The London Chronicle referred to her as the rightful heir to the throne, while the Lanercost Chronicle recorded a legend of Henry III giving her a golden crown before her death. With Geoffrey leaving no descendants, Henry III became the hereditary heir of the royal family.

Later in Henry&#x27;s reign, Simon de Montfort led the barons in another rebellion, beginning the Second Barons&#x27; War. The war ended in a clear royalist victory and in the death of many rebels, but not before the king had agreed to summon a parliament in 1265. In 1268, Henry III ordered the Amesbury Priory to commemorate both Arthur and Eleanor in commemoration of past kings and queens as well.

The next monarch, Edward Longshanks, was far more successful in maintaining royal power and was responsible for the conquest of Wales. He attempted to establish English domination of Scotland. However, gains in Scotland were reversed during the reign of his successor, Edward II, who also faced conflict with the nobility. In 1311, Edward II was forced to relinquish many of his powers to a committee of baronial &quot;ordainers&quot;; however, military victories helped him regain control in 1322. Edward was deposed by his wife Isabella and his son, Edward III, became king.

Edward III claimed the French Crown, setting off the Hundred Years&#x27; War between England and France. His campaigns conquered much French territory, but by 1374, all the gains had been lost. Edward&#x27;s reign was also marked by the further development of Parliament, which came to be divided into two Houses; he died in 1377, leaving the Crown to his 10-year-old grandson Richard II. Like many of his predecessors, Richard II conflicted with the nobles by attempting to concentrate power in his own hands. In 1399, while he was campaigning in Ireland, his cousin Henry Bolingbroke seized power. Richard was deposed, imprisoned, and eventually murdered, probably by starvation, and Henry became king as Henry IV.

Henry IV was the grandson of Edward III and the son of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster; hence, his dynasty was known as the House of Lancaster. For most of his reign, Henry IV was forced to fight off plots and rebellions; his success was partly due to the military skill of his son, the future Henry V. Henry V&#x27;s own reign, which began in 1413, was largely free from domestic strife, leaving the king free to pursue the Hundred Years&#x27; War in France. Although he was victorious, his sudden death in 1422 left his infant son Henry VI on the throne and gave the French an opportunity to overthrow English rule.

The unpopularity of Henry VI&#x27;s counsellors and his consort, Margaret of Anjou, as well as his own ineffectual leadership, led to the weakening of the House of Lancaster. The Lancastrians faced a challenge from the House of York, so-called because its head, a descendant of Edward III, was Richard, Duke of York, who was at odds with the Queen. Although the Duke of York died in battle in 1460, his eldest son, Edward IV, led the Yorkists to victory in 1461, overthrowing Henry VI and Margaret of Anjou. Edward IV was constantly at odds with the Lancastrians and his own councillors after his marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, with a brief return to power for Henry VI. Edward IV prevailed, winning back the throne at Barnet and killing the Lancastrian heir, Edward of Westminster, at Tewkesbury. Afterwards he captured Margaret of Anjou, eventually sending her into exile, but not before killing Henry VI while he was held prisoner in the Tower. The Wars of the Roses, nevertheless, continued intermittently during his reign and those of his son Edward V and brother Richard III. Edward V disappeared, presumably murdered by Richard. Ultimately, the conflict culminated in success for the Lancastrian branch led by Henry Tudor, in 1485, when Richard III was killed in the Battle of Bosworth Field.

King Henry VII then neutralised the remaining Yorkist forces, partly by marrying Elizabeth of York, daughter of King Edward IV and a Yorkist heir. Through skill and ability, Henry re-established absolute supremacy in the realm, and the conflicts with the nobility that had plagued previous monarchs came to an end. The reign of the second Tudor king, Henry VIII, was one of great political change. Religious upheaval and disputes with the Pope, and the fact that his marriage to Catherine of Aragon produced only one surviving child, a daughter, led the monarch to break from the Roman Catholic Church and establish the Church of England (the Anglican Church) and divorce his wife to marry Anne Boleyn.

Wales – which had been conquered centuries earlier, but had remained a separate dominion – was annexed to England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. Henry VIII&#x27;s son and successor, the young Edward VI, continued with further religious reforms, but his early death in 1553 precipitated a succession crisis. He was wary of allowing his Catholic elder half-sister Mary I to succeed, and therefore drew up a will designating Lady Jane Grey as his heiress. Jane&#x27;s reign, however, lasted only nine days; with tremendous popular support, Mary deposed her and declared herself the lawful sovereign. Mary I married Philip of Spain, who was declared king and co-ruler. He pursued disastrous wars in France and she attempted to return England to Roman Catholicism (burning Protestants at the stake as heretics in the process). Upon her death in 1558, the pair were succeeded by her Protestant half-sister Elizabeth I. England returned to Protestantism and continued its growth into a major world power by building its navy and exploring the New World.

===Scottish monarchy===
In Scotland, as in England, monarchies emerged after the withdrawal of the Roman Empire from Great Britain in the early fifth century. The three groups that lived in Scotland at this time were the Picts north of the Forth and Clyde, the Britons in the south, including the Kingdom of Strathclyde, and the Gaels or Scotti (who would later give their name to Scotland), of the Irish petty kingdom of Dál Riata in Argyll and the southern Hebrides. Kenneth MacAlpin is traditionally viewed as the first king of a united Scotland (known as Scotia to writers in Latin, or Alba to the Scots). The expansion of Scottish dominions continued over the next two centuries, as other territories such as Strathclyde were absorbed.

Early Scottish monarchs did not inherit the Crown directly; instead, the custom of tanistry was followed, where the monarchy alternated between different branches of the House of Alpin. There was an elective element to early Scottish kings and this practice lingered for much longer in Scotland. For example, the first Stewart monarch, Robert II, was selected from among eligible royal males at Linlithgow in 1370 by the Three Estates of the Scottish Parliament. However, as a result of this elective element, the rival dynastic lines clashed, often violently. From 942 to 1005, seven consecutive monarchs were either murdered or killed in battle. In 1005, Malcolm II ascended the throne having killed many rivals. He continued to ruthlessly eliminate opposition, and when he died in 1034 he was succeeded by his grandson, Duncan I, instead of a cousin, as had been usual. In 1040, Duncan suffered defeat in battle at the hands of Macbeth, who was killed himself in 1057 by Duncan&#x27;s son Malcolm. The following year, after killing Macbeth&#x27;s stepson Lulach, Malcolm ascended the throne as Malcolm III.

With a further series of battles and deposings, five of Malcolm&#x27;s sons as well as one of his brothers successively became king. Eventually, the Crown came to his youngest son, David I. David was succeeded by his grandsons Malcolm IV, and then by William the Lion, the longest-reigning King of Scots before the Union of the Crowns. William participated in a rebellion against King Henry II of England but when the rebellion failed, William was captured by the English. In exchange for his release, William was forced to acknowledge Henry as his feudal overlord. The English King Richard I agreed to terminate the arrangement in 1189, in return for a large sum of money needed for the Crusades. William died in 1214 and was succeeded by his son Alexander II. Alexander II, as well as his successor Alexander III, attempted to take over the Western Isles, which were still under the overlordship of Norway. During the reign of Alexander III, Norway launched an unsuccessful invasion of Scotland; the ensuing Treaty of Perth recognised Scottish control of the Western Isles and other disputed areas.

Alexander III&#x27;s death in a riding accident in 1286 precipitated a major succession crisis. Scottish leaders appealed to King Edward I of England for help in determining who was the rightful heir. Edward chose Alexander&#x27;s three-year-old Norwegian granddaughter, Margaret. On her way to Scotland in 1290, however, Margaret died at sea, and Edward was again asked to adjudicate between 13 rival claimants to the throne. A court was set up and after two years of deliberation, it pronounced John Balliol to be king. Edward proceeded to treat Balliol as a vassal and tried to exert influence over Scotland. In 1295, when Balliol renounced his allegiance to England, Edward I invaded. During the first ten years of the ensuing Wars of Scottish Independence, Scotland had no monarch, until Robert the Bruce declared himself king in 1306.

Robert&#x27;s efforts to control Scotland culminated in success and Scottish independence was acknowledged in 1328. However, only one year later, Robert died and was succeeded by his five-year-old son, David II. On the pretext of restoring John Balliol&#x27;s rightful heir, Edward Balliol, the English again invaded in 1332. During the next four years, Balliol was crowned, deposed, restored, deposed, restored, and deposed until he eventually settled in England, and David remained king for the next 35 years.

David II died childless in 1371 and was succeeded by his nephew Robert II of the House of Stuart. The reigns of both Robert II and his successor, Robert III, were marked by a general decline in royal power. When Robert III died in 1406, regents had to rule the country; the monarch, Robert III&#x27;s son James I, had been taken captive by the English. Having paid a large ransom, James returned to Scotland in 1424; to restore his authority, he used ruthless measures, including the execution of several of his enemies. He was assassinated by a group of nobles. James II continued his father&#x27;s policies by subduing influential noblemen but he was killed in an accident at the age of thirty, and a council of regents again assumed power. James III was defeated in a battle against rebellious Scottish earls in 1488, leading to another boy-king: James IV.

In 1513 James IV launched an invasion of England, attempting to take advantage of the absence of the English King Henry VIII. His forces met with disaster at Flodden Field; the king, many senior noblemen, and hundreds of soldiers were killed. As his son and successor, James V, was an infant, the government was again taken over by regents. James V led another disastrous war with the English in 1542, and his death in the same year left the Crown in the hands of his six-day-old daughter, Mary. Once again, a regency was established.

Mary, a Roman Catholic, reigned during a period of great religious upheaval in Scotland. As a result of the efforts of reformers such as John Knox, a Protestant ascendancy was established. Mary caused alarm by marrying her Catholic cousin, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, in 1565. After Lord Darnley&#x27;s assassination in 1567, Mary contracted an even more unpopular marriage with the Earl of Bothwell, who was widely suspected of Darnley&#x27;s murder. The nobility rebelled against the queen, forcing her to abdicate. She fled to England, and the Crown went to her infant son James VI, who was brought up as a Protestant. Mary was imprisoned and later executed by the English queen Elizabeth I.

===Personal union and republican phase===

Elizabeth I&#x27;s death in 1603 ended Tudor rule in England. Since she had no children, she was succeeded by the Scottish monarch James VI, who was the great-grandson of Henry VIII&#x27;s older sister and hence Elizabeth&#x27;s first cousin twice removed. James VI ruled in England as James I after what was known as the &quot;Union of the Crowns&quot;. Although England and Scotland were in personal union under one monarch – James I &amp; VI became the first monarch to style himself &quot;King of Great Britain&quot; in 1604 – they remained two separate kingdoms. James I &amp; VI&#x27;s successor, Charles I, experienced frequent conflicts with the English Parliament related to the issue of royal and parliamentary powers, especially the power to impose taxes. He provoked opposition by ruling without Parliament from 1629 to 1640, unilaterally levying taxes and adopting controversial religious policies (many of which were offensive to the Scottish Presbyterians and the English Puritans). His attempt to enforce Anglicanism led to organised rebellion in Scotland and ignited the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. In 1642, the conflict between the king and Parliament reached its climax and the English Civil War began.

The Civil War culminated in the execution of the king in 1649, the overthrow of the English monarchy, and the establishment of the Commonwealth of England. Charles I&#x27;s son, Charles II, was proclaimed King of Great Britain in Scotland, but he was forced to flee abroad after he invaded England and was defeated at the Battle of Worcester. In 1653, Oliver Cromwell, the most prominent military and political leader in the nation, seized power and declared himself Lord Protector (effectively becoming a military dictator, but refusing the title of king). Cromwell ruled until his death in 1658, when he was succeeded by his son Richard. The new Lord Protector had little interest in governing, and he soon resigned. The lack of clear leadership led to civil and military unrest, and to a popular desire to restore the monarchy. In 1660, the monarchy was restored and Charles II returned to Britain.

Charles II&#x27;s reign was marked by the development of the first modern political parties in England. Charles had no legitimate children and was due to be succeeded by his Roman Catholic brother, James, Duke of York. A parliamentary effort to exclude James from the line of succession arose; the &quot;Petitioners&quot;, who supported exclusion, became the Whig Party, whereas the &quot;Abhorrers&quot;, who opposed exclusion, became the Tory Party. The Exclusion Bill failed; on several occasions, Charles II dissolved Parliament because he feared that the bill might pass. After the dissolution of the Parliament of 1681, Charles ruled without a Parliament until his death in 1685. When James succeeded Charles, he pursued a policy of offering religious tolerance to Roman Catholics, thereby drawing the ire of many of his Protestant subjects. Many opposed James&#x27;s decisions to maintain a large standing army, appoint Roman Catholics to high political and military offices, and imprison Church of England clerics who challenged his policies. As a result, a group of Protestants known as the Immortal Seven invited James II &amp; VII&#x27;s daughter Mary and her husband William III of Orange to depose the king. William obliged, arriving in England on 5 November 1688 to great public support. Faced with the defection of many of his Protestant officials, James fled the realm and William and Mary (rather than James II &amp; VII&#x27;s Catholic son) were declared joint Sovereigns of England, Scotland and Ireland.

James&#x27;s overthrow, known as the Glorious Revolution, was one of the most important events in the long evolution of parliamentary power. The Bill of Rights 1689 affirmed parliamentary supremacy and declared that the English people held certain rights, including freedom from taxes imposed without parliamentary consent. The Bill of Rights required future monarchs to be Protestants and provided that, after any children of William and Mary, Mary&#x27;s sister Anne would inherit the Crown. Mary II died childless in 1694, leaving William III &amp; II as the sole monarch. By 1700, a political crisis arose, as all of Anne&#x27;s children had died, leaving her as the only individual left in the line of succession. Parliament was afraid that the former James II or his supporters, known as Jacobites, might attempt to reclaim the throne. Parliament passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which excluded James and his Catholic relations from the succession and made William&#x27;s nearest Protestant relations, the family of Sophia, Electress of Hanover, next in line to the throne after his sister-in-law Anne. Soon after the passage of the Act, William III &amp; II died, leaving the Crown to Anne.

===After the 1707 Acts of Union===
After Anne&#x27;s accession, the problem of succession re-emerged. The Scottish Parliament, infuriated that the English Parliament did not consult them on the choice of Sophia&#x27;s family as the next heirs, passed the Act of Security 1704, threatening to end the personal union between England and Scotland. The Parliament of England retaliated with the Alien Act 1705, threatening to devastate the Scottish economy by restricting trade. The Scottish and English parliaments negotiated the Acts of Union 1707, under which England and Scotland were united into a single Kingdom of Great Britain, with succession under the rules prescribed by the Act of Settlement.

In 1714, Queen Anne was succeeded by her second cousin, and Sophia&#x27;s son, George I, Elector of Hanover, who consolidated his position by defeating Jacobite rebellions in 1715 and 1719. The new monarch was less active in government than many of his British predecessors, but retained control over his German kingdoms, with which Britain was now in personal union. Power shifted towards George&#x27;s ministers, especially to Sir Robert Walpole, who is often considered the first British prime minister, although the title was not then in use.

The next monarch, George II, witnessed the end of the Jacobite threat in 1746 when the Catholic Stuarts were completely defeated. During the long reign of his grandson, George III, thirteen of Britain&#x27;s American colonies were lost when they formed the United States of America after the American Revolutionary War, but British influence elsewhere in the world continued to grow. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was created by the Acts of Union 1800.

From 1811 to 1820, George III was rendered incapable of ruling by mental illness. His son, the future George IV, ruled in his stead as Prince Regent. During the Regency and his own reign, the power of the monarchy declined, and by the time of his successor, William IV, the monarch was no longer able to interfere effectively with parliamentary power. In 1834, William dismissed the Whig Prime Minister, William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, and appointed a Tory, Sir Robert Peel. In the ensuing elections, however, Peel lost. The king had no choice but to recall Lord Melbourne. During William IV&#x27;s reign, the Reform Act 1832, which reformed parliamentary representation, was passed. Together with others passed later in the century, the Act led to an expansion of the electoral franchise and the rise of the House of Commons as the most important branch of Parliament.

The final transition to a constitutional monarchy was made during the long reign of William IV&#x27;s successor, Victoria. As a woman, Victoria could not rule Hanover, which permitted succession only in the male line, so the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover came to an end. The Victorian era was marked by great cultural change, technological progress, and the establishment of the United Kingdom as one of the world&#x27;s foremost powers. In recognition of British rule over India, Victoria was declared Empress of India in 1876. However, her reign was also marked by increased support for the republican movement, due in part to Victoria&#x27;s permanent mourning and lengthy period of seclusion following the death of her husband in 1861.

Victoria&#x27;s son, Edward VII, became the first monarch of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1901. In 1917, the next monarch, George V, changed &quot;Saxe-Coburg and Gotha&quot; to &quot;Windsor&quot; in response to the anti-German sentiment aroused by the First World War. George V&#x27;s reign was marked by the separation of Ireland into Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom, and the Irish Free State, an independent nation, in 1922.

===Shared monarchy===

During the twentieth century, the Commonwealth of Nations evolved from the British Empire. Prior to 1926, the British Crown reigned over the British Empire collectively; the Dominions and Crown Colonies were subordinate to the United Kingdom. The Balfour Declaration of 1926 gave complete self-government to the Dominions, effectively creating a system whereby a single monarch operated independently in each separate Dominion. The concept was solidified by the Statute of Westminster 1931, which has been likened to &quot;a treaty among the Commonwealth countries&quot;.

The monarchy thus ceased to be an exclusively British institution, although it is often still referred to as &quot;British&quot; for legal and historical reasons and for convenience. The monarch became separately monarch of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and so forth; one person reigning in multiple distinct sovereign states, in a relationship likened to a personal union.

George V&#x27;s death in 1936 was followed by the accession of Edward VIII, who caused a public scandal by announcing his desire to marry the divorced American Wallis Simpson, even though the Church of England opposed the remarriage of divorcees. Accordingly, Edward announced his intention to abdicate; the Parliaments of the United Kingdom and of other Commonwealth countries granted his request. Edward VIII and any children by his new wife were excluded from the line of succession, and the Crown went to his brother, George VI. George served as a rallying figure for the British people during World War II, making morale-boosting visits to the troops as well as to munitions factories and areas bombed by Nazi Germany. In June 1948 George VI relinquished the title &quot;Emperor of India&quot;, although remaining head of state of the Dominion of India.

At first, every member of the Commonwealth retained the same monarch as the United Kingdom, but when the Dominion of India became a republic in 1950, it would no longer share in a common monarchy. Instead, the British monarch was acknowledged as &quot;Head of the Commonwealth&quot; in all Commonwealth member states, whether they were realms or republics. The position is purely ceremonial, and is not inherited by the British monarch as of right but is vested in an individual chosen by the Commonwealth heads of government. Member states of the Commonwealth that share the same person as monarch are informally known as Commonwealth realms.

===Monarchy in Ireland===
In 1155 the only English Pope, Adrian IV, authorised King Henry II of England to take possession of Ireland as a feudal territory nominally under papal overlordship. The Pope wanted the English monarch to annex Ireland and bring the Irish church into line with Rome, despite this process already being underway in Ireland by 1155. An all-island kingship of Ireland had been created in 854 by Máel Sechnaill mac Máele Ruanaid. His last successor was Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, who had become High King of Ireland in early 1166 and exiled Diarmait Mac Murchada, the King of Leinster, a vassal kingdom. Diarmait asked Henry II for help, gaining a group of Anglo-Norman aristocrats and adventurers, led by Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, to help him regain his throne. Diarmait and his Anglo-Norman allies succeeded and he became King of Leinster again. De Clare married Diarmait&#x27;s daughter, and when Diarmait died in 1171, de Clare became King of Leinster. Henry was afraid that de Clare would make Ireland a rival Norman kingdom, so he took advantage of the papal bull and invaded, forcing de Clare and the other Anglo-Norman aristocrats in Ireland and the major Irish kings and lords to recognise him as their overlord.

By 1542, King Henry VIII of England had broken with the Church of Rome and declared himself Supreme Head of the Church of England. The Pope&#x27;s grant of Ireland to the English monarch became invalid, so Henry summoned a meeting of the Irish Parliament to change his title from &quot;Lord of Ireland&quot; to &quot;King of Ireland&quot;.

In 1800, as a result of the Irish Rebellion of 1798, the Act of Union merged the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The whole island of Ireland continued to be a part of the United Kingdom until 1922 when what is now the Republic of Ireland won independence as the Irish Free State, a separate Dominion within the Commonwealth. The Irish Free State was renamed Ireland in 1937, and in 1949 declared itself a republic, left the Commonwealth and severed all ties with the monarchy. Northern Ireland remained within the Union. In 1927, the United Kingdom changed its name to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, while the monarch&#x27;s style for the next twenty years became &quot;of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India&quot;.

===Modern status and popularity===
In the 1990s, republicanism in the United Kingdom grew, partly on account of negative publicity associated with the royal family (for instance, immediately following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales). However, &quot;The Independent&quot; maintained polls from 2002 to 2007 showed that around 70–80% of the British public supported the continuation of the monarchy. In September 2022, shortly after the death of Elizabeth II, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that a YouGov poll showed that 68% of British people felt positively about the monarchy. The newspaper speculated that some of this may have been a reaction to the Queen&#x27;s death, and said it showed dissatisfaction is higher among young people; 47% of people aged between 18 and 24 wanted the monarchy to continue, compared to 86% aged 65 and over. In May 2022, before the Queen&#x27;s death, the newspaper reported that polling showed 33% of those aged between 18 and 24 wanted the monarchy to continue. In January 2023, a YouGov survey of roughly 1,700 UK people found that 64% thought that the country should continue to have a monarchy, though that was lower than the 67% in September 2022 around the time of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s death.

==Religious role==
The sovereign is the supreme governor of the established Church of England. Archbishops and bishops are appointed by the monarch, on the advice of the prime minister, who chooses the appointee from a list of nominees prepared by a Church Commission. The Crown&#x27;s role in the Church of England is titular; the most senior clergyman, the Archbishop of Canterbury, is the spiritual leader of the Church and of the worldwide Anglican Communion. The monarch takes an oath to preserve the Church of Scotland and he or she holds the power to appoint the Lord High Commissioner to the Church&#x27;s General Assembly, but otherwise plays no part in its governance, and exerts no powers over it. The sovereign plays no formal role in the disestablished Church in Wales or Church of Ireland.

==Succession==
The relationship between the Commonwealth realms is such that any change to the laws governing succession to the shared throne requires the unanimous consent of all the realms. Succession is governed by statutes such as the Bill of Rights 1689, the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Acts of Union 1707. The rules of succession may only be changed by an Act of Parliament; it is not possible for an individual to renounce his or her right of succession. The Act of Settlement restricts the succession to the legitimate Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover (1630–1714), a granddaughter of James I and VI.

Upon demise of the Crown (the death of a sovereign), their heir immediately and automatically succeeds (hence the phrase &quot;The king is dead, long live the king!&quot;), and the accession of the new sovereign is publicly proclaimed by an Accession Council that meets at St James&#x27;s Palace. Upon their accession, a new sovereign is required by law to make and subscribe several oaths: the Accession Declaration as first required by the Bill of Rights, and an oath that they will &quot;maintain and preserve&quot; the Church of Scotland settlement as required by the Act of Union. The monarch is usually crowned in Westminster Abbey, normally by the Archbishop of Canterbury. A coronation is not necessary for a sovereign to reign; indeed, the ceremony usually takes place many months after accession to allow sufficient time for its preparation and for a period of mourning.

When an individual ascends the throne, it is expected they will reign until death. The only voluntary abdication, that of Edward VIII, had to be authorised by a special Act of Parliament, His Majesty&#x27;s Declaration of Abdication Act 1936. The last monarch involuntarily removed from power was James II and VII, who fled into exile in 1688 during the Glorious Revolution.

===Restrictions by sex and religion===

Succession was by male-preference cognatic primogeniture, under which sons inherit before daughters, and elder children inherit before younger ones of the same sex. The British prime minister, David Cameron, announced at the 2011 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting that all 16 Commonwealth realms, including the United Kingdom, had agreed to abolish the male-preference rule for anyone born after the date of the meeting, 28 October 2011. They also agreed that future monarchs would no longer be prohibited from marrying a Roman Catholic – a law which dated from the Act of Settlement 1701. However, since the monarch is also the Supreme Governor of the Church of England, the laws which restrict the throne to Protestants remain. The necessary UK legislation making the changes received the royal assent on 25 April 2013 and was brought into force in March 2015 after the equivalent legislation was approved in all the other Commonwealth realms.

Though Catholics are prohibited from succeeding and are deemed &quot;naturally dead&quot; for succession purposes, the disqualification does not extend to the individual&#x27;s legitimate Protestant descendants.

===Regency===

The Regency Acts allow for regencies in the event of a monarch who is a minor or who is physically or mentally incapacitated. When a regency is necessary, the next qualified individual in the line of succession automatically becomes regent, unless they themselves are a minor or incapacitated. Special provisions were made for Queen Elizabeth II by the Regency Act 1953, which stated that Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (her husband) could act as regent in these circumstances.

During a temporary physical infirmity or an absence from the kingdom, the sovereign may temporarily delegate some of his or her functions to counsellors of state, chosen from the monarch&#x27;s spouse and the first four adults in the line of succession. The present counsellors of state are: Queen Camilla; William, Prince of Wales; Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex; Prince Andrew, Duke of York; Princess Beatrice; Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh; and Anne, Princess Royal. While still able to serve, the Duke of Sussex and Duke of York no longer carry out royal duties. With the accession of Charles III and planned overseas trips in 2023, it was decided to expand the list of those eligible to serve as counsellors of state. On 14 November 2022, the King sent a message to both Houses of Parliament, formally asking for a change in the law that would allow Princess Anne and Prince Edward to be added to the list of counsellors of state. The next day, a bill to that end was introduced in Parliament and it received royal assent on 6 December, coming into force on 7 December.

==Finances==

Until 1760, the monarch met all official expenses from hereditary revenues, which included the profits of the Crown Estate (the royal property portfolio). King George III agreed to surrender the hereditary revenues of the Crown in return for the Civil List, and this arrangement persisted until 2012. An annual Property Services grant-in-aid paid for the upkeep of the royal residences, and an annual Royal Travel Grant-in-Aid paid for travel. The Civil List covered most expenses, including those for staffing, state visits, public engagements, and official entertainment. Its size was fixed by Parliament every 10 years; any money saved was carried forward to the next 10-year period. From 2012, the Civil List and Grants-in-Aid were replaced with a single Sovereign Grant, which was initially set at 15% of the revenues generated by the Crown Estate and increased to 25% in March 2017. The programme of overseas visits by the monarch is determined by the Royal Visits Committee, a Cabinet Office committee.

The Crown Estate is one of the largest property portfolios in the United Kingdom, with holdings of £15.6 billion in 2022. It is held in trust, and cannot be sold or owned by the sovereign in a private capacity. In modern times, the profits surrendered from the Crown Estate to the Treasury have exceeded the Sovereign Grant. For example, the Crown Estate produced £312.7 million in the financial year 2021–22, whereas the Sovereign Grant for the monarch was £86.3 million during the same period.

Like the Crown Estate, the land and assets of the Duchy of Lancaster, a property portfolio valued at £383 million in 2011, are held in trust. The revenues of the Duchy form part of the Privy Purse, and are used for expenses not borne by the parliamentary grants. The Paradise Papers, leaked in 2017, show that the Duchy of Lancaster held investments in the British tax havens of the Cayman Islands and Bermuda. The Duchy of Cornwall is a similar estate held in trust to meet the expenses of the monarch&#x27;s eldest son. The Royal Collection, which includes artworks and the Crown Jewels, is not owned by the sovereign personally and is held in trust, as are the occupied palaces in the United Kingdom such as Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle.

The sovereign is subject to indirect taxes such as value-added tax, and since 1993 the monarch has paid income tax and capital gains tax on personal income. Parliamentary grants to the sovereign are not treated as income as they are solely for official expenditure. Republicans estimate that the real cost of the monarchy, including security and potential income not claimed by the state, such as profits from the duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall and rent of Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, is £334 million a year.

Estimates of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s wealth varied, depending on whether assets owned by her personally or held in trust for the nation were included. &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine estimated her wealth at US$450 million in 2010, but no official figure was available. In 1993, the Lord Chamberlain said estimates of £100 million were &quot;grossly overstated&quot;. Jock Colville, who was her former private secretary and a director of her bank, Coutts, estimated her wealth in 1971 at £2 million (the equivalent of about £ today). The &quot;Sunday Times Rich List 2020&quot; estimated Elizabeth II&#x27;s personal wealth at £350 million.

==Residences==

The sovereign&#x27;s official residence in London is Buckingham Palace. It is the site of most state banquets, investitures, royal christenings and other ceremonies. Another official residence is Windsor Castle, the largest occupied castle in the world, which is used principally at weekends, Easter and during Royal Ascot, an annual race meeting that is part of the social calendar. The sovereign&#x27;s official residence in Scotland is the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh. The monarch stays at Holyrood for at least one week each year, and when visiting Scotland on state occasions.

Historically, the Palace of Westminster and the Tower of London were the main residences of the English monarch until Henry VIII acquired the Palace of Whitehall. Whitehall was destroyed by fire in 1698, leading to a shift to St James&#x27;s Palace. Although replaced as the monarch&#x27;s primary London residence by Buckingham Palace in 1837, St James&#x27;s is still the senior palace and remains the ceremonial royal residence. For example, foreign ambassadors are accredited to the Court of St James&#x27;s, and the Palace is the site of the meeting of the Accession Council. It is also used by other members of the royal family.

Other residences include Clarence House and Kensington Palace. The palaces belong to the Crown; they are held in trust for future rulers and cannot be sold by the monarch. Sandringham House in Norfolk and Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire are privately owned by the royal family.

==Style==

The present sovereign&#x27;s full style and title is &quot;Charles the Third, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of His other Realms and Territories, King, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith&quot;. The title &quot;Head of the Commonwealth&quot; is held by the king personally, and is not vested in the British Crown. Pope Leo X first granted the title &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot; to King Henry VIII in 1521, rewarding him for his support of the Papacy during the early years of the Protestant Reformation, particularly for his book the Defence of the Seven Sacraments. After Henry broke from the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Paul III revoked the grant, but Parliament passed a law authorising its continued use.

The sovereign is known as &quot;His Majesty&quot; or &quot;Her Majesty&quot;. The form &quot;Britannic Majesty&quot; appears in international treaties and on passports to differentiate the British monarch from foreign rulers. The monarch chooses his or her regnal name, not necessarily his or her first name – George VI, Edward VII and Victoria did not use their first names.

If only one monarch has used a particular name, no ordinal is used; for example, Queen Victoria is not known as &quot;Victoria I&quot;, and ordinals are not used for English monarchs who reigned before the Norman conquest of England. The question of whether numbering for British monarchs is based on previous English or Scottish monarchs was raised in 1953 when Scottish nationalists challenged the Queen&#x27;s use of &quot;Elizabeth II&quot;, on the grounds that there had never been an &quot;Elizabeth I&quot; in Scotland. In &quot;MacCormick v Lord Advocate&quot;, the Scottish Court of Session ruled against the plaintiffs, finding that the Queen&#x27;s title was a matter of her own choice and prerogative. The Home Secretary told the House of Commons that monarchs since the Acts of Union had consistently used the higher of the English and Scottish ordinals, which in the applicable four cases has been the English ordinal. The prime minister confirmed this practice but noted that &quot;neither The Queen nor her advisers could seek to bind their successors&quot;. 

==Arms==

The coat of arms of the United Kingdom is &quot;Quarterly, I and IV Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or [for England]; II Or a lion rampant within a double tressure flory-counter-flory Gules [for Scotland]; III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent [for Ireland]&quot;. The supporters are the Lion and the Unicorn; the motto is &quot;&quot; (French: &quot;God and my Right&quot;). Surrounding the shield is a representation of a Garter bearing the motto of the Chivalric order of the same name; &quot;&quot;. (Old French: &quot;Shame be to him who thinks evil of it&quot;). In Scotland, the monarch uses an alternative form of the arms in which quarters I and IV represent Scotland, II England, and III Ireland. The mottoes are &quot; (an abbreviated form of the Scots &quot;) and the motto of the Order of the Thistle, &quot;&#x27;&quot; (Latin: &quot;No-one provokes me with impunity&quot;); the supporters are the unicorn and lion, who support both the escutcheon and lances, from which fly the flags of Scotland and England.

The monarch&#x27;s official flag in the United Kingdom is the Royal Standard, which depicts the Royal Arms in banner form. It is flown only from buildings, vessels and vehicles in which the sovereign is present. The Royal Standard is never flown at half-mast because there is always a sovereign: when one dies, his or her successor becomes the sovereign instantly.


When the monarch is not in residence, the Union Flag is flown at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle and Sandringham House, whereas in Scotland the Royal Banner of Scotland is flown at Holyrood Palace and Balmoral Castle.

<text>Anthony L. Ray (born August 12, 1963), better known by his stage name Sir Mix-a-Lot or his CB handle Prime Minista, is an American rapper. He is best known for his 1992 hit song &quot;Baby Got Back&quot;, which peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Early life==
Anthony Ray was born on August 12, 1963, in Auburn, Washington, and grew up in Seattle&#x27;s Central District. In Ray&#x27;s youth, his mother worked as a licensed practical nurse at the King County Jail. Ray was a fan of hip hop and started rapping in the early 1980s.

While living in the Bryant Manor apartments on 19th Ave and East Yesler Way, Anthony Ray started school at Roosevelt High School, near the University District, when the Seattle Public School District was in the throes of what would be a 21-year experiment to integrate the school system; Guns N&#x27; Roses member Duff McKagan and actress Rose McGowan also went there. Students were bused from their neighborhoods to schools at the other end of the city. From 1978 to 1999, when the busing program was in operation, minorities carried the burden of busing, going from the South End and the Central Area to predominantly white schools in the North End.

Ray said he knew that some North End residents did not want black children bused into their neighborhoods. But for him, the experience offered respite from the projects. &quot;I&#x27;ve heard things like, &#x27;Forced integration is not good,&#x27; &#x27;I want my kid to be able to go to school in our community; that&#x27;s why we moved here&#x27; – all those things I totally understand,&quot; he said. &quot;But from my perspective, I didn&#x27;t have the luxury of living in a neighborhood where a good school was. We didn&#x27;t make that kind of money. So from my perspective, it was the best thing that could have happened to me.&quot; A music teacher at Eckstein Middle School introduced Ray to the possibility of a music career.

Ray was interested in electronics and CB radio from a young age. One of his early jobs was working at a pinball arcade servicing machines, and during that time he started to fix keyboards and other musical equipment. He still works with electronics as a hobby.

==Career==
===1980s===
Soon after high school, he began DJing parties at local community centers. By 1983, Sir Mix-a-Lot had begun playing weekends regularly at the Rainier Vista Boys and Girls Club in South Seattle. Soon he moved locations and started hosting his parties at the Rotary Boys and Girls Club in the Central District. It was there that he met &#x27;Nasty&#x27; Nes Rodriguez, a local radio DJ and host of Fresh Tracks, the West Coast&#x27;s first rap radio show on Seattle station KKFX (K-Fox).

Sir Mix-a-Lot partnered with Nasty Nes and local businessman Ed Locke to found the Nastymix record label in 1983. The first song to gain popularity outside of Seattle was &quot;Square Dance Rap&quot; in 1986. Mix-a-Lot had originally decided to rap the entire song slowly, then speed it up and increase its pitch in post production, Mix later told &quot;Seattle Refined&quot; in 2018 that &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to rap, that&#x27;s why I use this weird Smurf voice&quot;. After the song was picked up by DJs in clubs nationwide, he toured Florida, New York, and other states. While in Arizona, he noticed a street named Broadway with a restaurant named Dick&#x27;s, just like Seattle. This gave him the idea to write his next hit, &quot;Posse on Broadway&quot;. The title referred to Broadway in Seattle&#x27;s Capitol Hill district. Released in 1987, the single made the Top 100 but quickly disappeared, although it remains popular in the Seattle area for its references to many local landmarks.

&quot;Swass&quot;, Sir Mix-a-Lot&#x27;s debut album, was released in 1988 with two other singles: &quot;Square-Dance Rap&quot; and &quot;Iron Man&quot;, a rap metal track sampling from the song of the same name by Black Sabbath; it was backed by the band Metal Church. In 1990, the Recording Industry Association of America certified &quot;Swass&quot; platinum.

&quot;Seminar&quot;, released in 1989, featured &quot;My Hooptie&quot;, &quot;Beepers&quot;, &quot;Gortex&quot; and &quot;I Got Game&quot;.

===1990s===
In 1991, Sir Mix-a-Lot signed to the Def American label, which also bought the rights to his first two albums, and released his third album &quot;Mack Daddy&quot; in 1992. The single &quot;Baby Got Back&quot; was a number one hit that went double platinum and won the 1993 Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance. MTV aired the music video for the song only after 9 PM because of &quot;many, many, complaints.&quot;

In 1993, Sir Mix-a-Lot collaborated with Seattle-based grunge band Mudhoney for the song &quot;Freak Momma&quot; on the &quot;Judgment Night&quot; soundtrack.

In 1994, he released the album &quot;Chief Boot Knocka&quot;, which reached #69 on the Billboard 200 and #28 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Charts. The album featured the hit single &quot;Put &#x27;Em On The Glass&quot;. &quot;Just Da Pimpin&#x27; in Me&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance but lost to &quot;Let Me Ride&quot; by Dr. Dre.

When his 1996 album &quot;Return of the Bumpasaurus&quot; was only given a low label promotion, leading to lackluster sales, Sir Mix-a-Lot left Def American.

In 1999–2000, he worked closely with the band The Presidents of the United States of America under the group name &quot;Subset&quot; with a combination of rock and rap music. They released some songs online and toured, but nothing was ever officially released.

===2000s===
Sir Mix-a-Lot signed with the independent label Artist Direct for his 2003 album &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Home&quot; with &quot;Big Johnson&quot; as its lead single. The next year, he released a DVD entitled &quot;Shhhh... Don&#x27;t Tell &#x27;Em That&quot; to promote the album.

===2010s===
In 2010, Sir Mix-a-Lot announced his next album, &quot;Dun 4got About Mix&quot;. The lead single &quot;Carz&quot; was released to YouTube on 23 Nov 2010. By June 2011, the video had had over a million views, although no release date for the album has been set as of 2023. In the same year, his &quot;F.U.B.a.R. Remix&quot; for the song &quot;Conditions Of My Parole&quot; appeared on Puscifer&#x27;s remix album &quot;All Re-Mixed Up&quot;.
In 2013, Sir Mix-a-Lot produced the album &quot;Dream&quot; for the urban rock band Ayron Jones and The Way. He opened their album release party at Neumos on November 2. That Christmas season, he promoted the Washington State Lottery over the Christmas season, with advertisements featuring his music appearing on Spotify.

On June 6, 2014, Sir Mix-a-Lot collaborated and performed with the Seattle Symphony on a new composition by Gabriel Prokofiev as part of the symphony&#x27;s Sonic Evolution series of new orchestral pieces inspired by Seattle&#x27;s music icons.

In 2014, rapper Nicki Minaj released the single &quot;Anaconda&quot;, which prominently featured samples from &quot;Baby Got Back&quot;. Sir Mix-a-Lot praised both the artist and the song, calling it the &quot;new and improved version&quot; of &quot;Baby Got Back&quot;.

In March 2016, Sir Mix-a-Lot collaborated with TNT and LK on the track and video, &quot;Streets Don&#x27;t Love Me&quot;.

From 2017 to 2019, Sir Mix-a-Lot hosted a morning radio show based in Seattle on Hot 103.7 FM.

He owns multiple residences, including one in Auburn, Washington, where he has continued to maintain a strong presence performing at small festivals across the country.

==Other work==
In 1995, Sir Mix-a-Lot was the regular host of the short-lived UPN anthology drama series &quot;The Watcher&quot;, in which, in 2000, he was quoted in Vibe magazine as saying &quot;in retrospect, I wish I hadn&#x27;t done (the show)&quot;

In 2006, Sir Mix-a-Lot appeared on Adult Swim&#x27;s &quot;Tom Goes to the Mayor&quot; and the 17th Treehouse of Horror on Fox&#x27;s &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. In 2008, he appeared on Adult Swim&#x27;s &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; singing a song entitled &quot;Table Be Round&quot;. It was sung in the style of &quot;Baby Got Back&quot;, but was about to King Arthur&#x27;s creation of the Round Table. He also voiced politician Hans Blix and singer Stevie Wonder in the season 3 finale. He appeared in &quot;The Judge&quot; episode of Season 4 of &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot; playing himself.

Sir Mix-a-Lot provides narration and commentary in &quot;Wheedle&#x27;s Groove&quot;, a 2009 documentary about the Seattle 1960s and 70s funk and soul scene.

In June 2018, the DIY Network aired a special called &quot;Sir Mix-A-Lot&#x27;s House Remix&quot;, which involved Sir Mix-a-Lot buying and flipping a house in Seattle.

In 2019, he became the spokesperson for Cards Against Humanity&#x27;s &quot;Ass Pack&quot;.
