<text>Slough () is a town in Berkshire, England, in the Thames Valley, west of central London and north-east of Reading, at the intersection of the M4, M40 and M25 motorways. It is part of the historic county of Buckinghamshire. In 2021, the population of the town was 143,184. The wider Borough of Slough had a population of 158,500.

Slough&#x27;s population is one of the most ethnically diverse in the United Kingdom, attracting people from across the country and the world for labour since the 1920s, which has helped shape it into a major trading centre. In 2017, unemployment stood at 1.4%, one-third the UK average of 4.5%.

Slough has the highest concentration of UK HQs of global companies outside London. Slough Trading Estate is the largest industrial estate in single private ownership in Europe, with over 17,000 jobs in 400 businesses. Blackberry, McAfee, Burger King, DHL, Telefonica and Lego have head offices in the town.

==History==
The name was first recorded in 1195 as &quot;Slo&quot;. It first seems to have applied to a hamlet between Upton to the east and Chalvey to the west, roughly around the &quot;Crown Crossroads&quot; where the road to Windsor (now the A332) met the Great West Road. The Domesday Survey of 1086 refers to Upton, and a wood for 200 pigs, worth £15. During the 13th century, King Henry III had a palace at Cippenham. Parts of Upton Court were built in 1325, while St Mary the Virgin Church in Langley was probably built in the late 11th or early 12th century, though it has been rebuilt and enlarged several times.

From the mid-17th century, stagecoaches began to pass through Slough and Salt Hill (later absorbed into Slough), which became locations for the second stage to change horses on the journey out from London. By 1838 and the opening of the Great Western Railway, Upton-cum-Chalvey&#x27;s parish population had reached 1,502. In 1849, a branch line was completed from Slough to Windsor &amp; Eton Central, opposite Windsor Castle, for Queen Victoria&#x27;s convenience.

Slough has 96 listed buildings. There are
* Four Grade I: St Laurence&#x27;s Church (Upton), St Mary the Virgin Church, Langley, Baylis House and Godolphin Court
* Seven Grade II*: St Mary&#x27;s Church (Upton-cum-Chalvey), Upton Court, the Kederminster and Seymour Almshouses in Langley, St Peter&#x27;s Church (Chalvey), Ostrich Inn (Colnbrook) and King John&#x27;s Palace (Colnbrook)
* Grade II listed structures include four milestones, Beech, Oak and Linden Houses at Upton Hospital, St Ethelbert&#x27;s Church, Slough and Slough railway station.

1918 saw a large area of agricultural land to the west of Slough developed as an army motor repair depot, used to store and repair huge numbers of motor vehicles coming back from the battlefields of the First World War in Flanders. In April 1920, the Government sold the site and its contents to the Slough Trading Co. Ltd. Repair of ex-army vehicles continued until 1925, when the Slough Trading Company Act was passed allowing the company (renamed Slough Estates Ltd) to establish an industrial estate. Spectacular growth and employment ensued, with Slough attracting workers from many parts of the UK and abroad. Slough Town Hall, which was designed by Charles Holloway James and Stephen Rowland Pierce, was completed in 1937.

During the Second World War, Slough experienced a series of air raids, mostly in October 1940 (the largest number of people, five, dying as a result of a raid on the 13th), and an emergency hospital treating casualties from London was set up in Slough. Local air raid deaths and deaths at the hospital account for the 23 civilian lives recorded lost in the borough area.

After the war, several further large housing developments arose to take large numbers of people migrating from war-damaged London. Between 1955 and 1957 the town was the site of the Slough experiment, a large-scale road safety trial.

The old Slough library was opened on 28 November 1974. It was officially called the Robert Taylor Library, named after Alderman Taylor in recognition of his contribution to the library service. The library was officially opened by the Mayor, Councillor DR Peters, on 15 May 1975. It was demolished in May 2017 as part of the programme of redevelopment in the town centre.

===Redevelopment===

In the 21st century, Slough has seen major redevelopment of the town centre. Old buildings are being replaced with new offices and shopping complexes. Tesco has replaced an existing superstore with a larger Tesco Extra. The Heart of Slough Project is plan for the large-scale redevelopment of the town centre as a focus and cultural quarter for the creative media, information and communications industries created a mixed-use complex, multi-functional buildings, visual landmarks and a public space in the Thames Valley. Approval was given for the £400 million project by Slough Borough Council&#x27;s planning committee on 9 July 2009, and work began in 2010 for completion in 2018.

In December 2009, two key components of the project were signed: the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) signed its agreement to provide £11m of funding for infrastructure and Thames Valley University (TVU) courses which were due to remain in the town found a new home at the Centre in Farnham Road, Slough. In parallel to the town centre redevelopment plan, Segro (owner of the Slough Trading Estate) planned to spend £600 million over the following 20 years on the estate. This was intended to create environmentally sustainable buildings, open green spaces, two hotels, a conference centre, cafés, restaurants and better transport facilities to improve links to Slough town centre and the surrounding residential areas. It was claimed that the plan would create more than 4,100 new jobs and contribute around £100m a year to Slough&#x27;s economy. If both plans went ahead, nearly £1 billion would be spent on redeveloping Slough over the next 20 years.

In 2009, Herschel Park (known as Upton Park until 1949), named for astronomer William Herschel, was relandscaped in a multimillion-pound effort to bring it back to its former Victorian era glory. The park was featured in an episode of the documentary programme &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; focusing on the TV presenter Davina McCall.

In 2010, £2 million was set aside to improve disabled access to Slough railway station in preparation for an expected increase in use during the 2012 London Olympics. Preparations were under way for the regeneration of the Britwell suburb of Slough, involving tearing down a dilapidated block of flats and the closing of the public house the Jolly Londoner in Wentworth Avenue and replacing them with new homes, as well as relocating the shopping parade in the street to nearby Kennedy Park.

As part of the Heart of Slough project, construction work on a new bus station began in March 2010, following weeks of demolition work to half of the existing bus station and the removal of Compair House near the railway station. It was opened in May 2011.

Redevelopment on this scale has been strongly criticised by conservation groups. The Twentieth Century Society has stated that

[A] tragically high quantity of good buildings have been demolished in Slough in recent years, including grand Art-Deco-styled factories by the likes of Wallis Gilbert and high-quality post-war offices. More are to come down as the town tries to erase its past and reinvent itself from scratch. Despite famously heckling Slough, John Betjeman&#x27;s praise for the town hall&#x27;s architecture as &#x27;a striving for unity out of chaos&#x27; in 1948 has never been so relevant as today. C20 believes that the redevelopment of the town hall would be an act of vandalism to the civic centre and is supporting the Campaign to Save Slough&#x27;s Heritage in their request for a review of the decision.
During November 2016, the Slough Queensmere and Observatory shopping centres were sold to Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) in a deal worth £130 million.

In February 2025, it was reported that the council was considering a number of options to merge with larger local authorities, including joining a London borough or becoming part of the Greater London Authority.

==Geography==
Slough is west of Charing Cross, central London, north of Windsor, east of Maidenhead, south-east of High Wycombe and north-east of the county town of Reading. Slough is within the Greater London Urban Area and on the border with London Borough of Hillingdon and London Borough of Hounslow. Heathrow Airport is 5 miles away. Nearby towns are Uxbridge to the northeast and Beaconsfield to the north.

Most of the area that now makes up Slough was anciently part of Buckinghamshire, however, Poyle was historically in Middlesex. The town developed by the expansion and amalgamation of villages along the Great West Road. Over the years Slough has expanded greatly, incorporating a number of different villages. Original villages that are now suburbs of Slough include Chalvey, Cippenham, Colnbrook, Langley, Poyle, Upton, and Wexham.

Named neighbourhoods include Brands Hill, Britwell, Huntercombe, Manor Park, Salt Hill, Upton Lea and Windsor Meadows. The urban area merges into the neighbouring parishes of Burnham, a small area of Taplow near Cippenham, Farnham Royal and Stoke Poges which remain in the county of Buckinghamshire and Datchet which is in Berkshire. Eton is narrowly buffered by the Jubilee River and by green space (mainly the college playing fields) from part of Slough, and the two areas formerly formed the Eton birth, marriages and deaths registration district.

===Climate===
The nearest Met Office weather observing station to Slough is Heathrow Airport, about east of Slough town centre. This part of the Thames Valley is notable for generally having the warmest daytime summer temperatures on average in the British Isles. Typically, according to 1981–2010 normals, the average high temperature in July is 23.5 °C (74.3 °F.)

Rainfall is low compared to most of the British Isles, with under annually, and 105 days reporting over 1 mm of rain.

==Demography==

According to the 2021 census, Slough is a large town with a population of 158,400 of which 46.9% of the population was Asian, 35.9% white, 7.5% black, 4% mixed race, 1.2% Arab and 4.5% of other ethnic heritage. This makes the town one of the most ethnically diverse local authorities in the country outside of London. 

Despite its diverse population, English is the most spoken language in 2021, with over 110,212 citing English as their first language. Those stating other languages is significantly lower due to the large shares of the British Asian and Black population speaking English as their first language. Aside from English, the most commonly spoken languages are Punjabi, Polish, and Urdu.

Figures from the 2021 census showed that 32% of Slough&#x27;s population identified as Christian, 29.4% as Muslim, 11.4% as Sikh, 7.8% as Hindu, 0.5% as Buddhist, 0.1% as Jewish, 0.5% as having other religions, 13% as having no religion and 5.4% did not answer the question.

Further information can be found on the page Demographics of Slough.

==Governance==

There is one main tier of local government covering Slough, at unitary authority level: Slough Borough Council, which is based at Observatory House in the town centre. Most of the urban area is unparished, although some of the suburbs are included in civil parishes, including Britwell and Wexham Court.

===Administrative history===
Slough was historically a hamlet in the parish of Upton, also known as Upton-cum-Chalvey, in Buckinghamshire. Until 1863 it was administered by the parish vestry and manorial courts, in the same way as most rural areas. As Slough began developing into a town, the need for more urban forms of local government grew. In 1863 a local government district was established for Slough, covering part of the parish of Upton-cum-Chalvey (including the old village of Upton) and a smaller part of the neighbouring parish of Stoke Poges. The town was then governed by an elected local board.

Such local government districts were converted into urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. In 1900 the Slough urban district was enlarged to absorb most of the residual parts of the old Upton-cum-Chalvey parish that had been outside the urban district, including Chalvey. The urban district was further enlarged in 1930, when it was significantly expanded to take in most of the neighbouring parish of Langley (including the village), the Salt Hill area from the parish of Farnham Royal, and the Cippenham area from the parish of Burnham. In 1938 the urban district was incorporated to become a municipal borough. 

In 1974, the Municipal Borough of Slough was replaced by a larger non-metropolitan district with borough status called Slough. The enlarged district gained the Britwell and Wexham Court areas, and was transferred from Buckinghamshire to Berkshire. The borough was enlarged in 1995 to take in Colnbrook with Poyle.

In 1998 Slough Borough Council became a unitary authority when Berkshire County Council was abolished and the borough council took on the former county council&#x27;s functions in the borough.

Since 2015, Slough has had a Youth Parliament to represent the views of younger people.

===Town twinning===
Slough is twinned with:
* Montreuil, France &quot;(since 1988)&quot;

==Economy==

Before the 19th century, the main businesses of Slough were brickfields and agriculture. The bricks for the building of Eton College were made in Slough. Later, as the Great West Road traffic increased, inns and pubs sprang up along the road to service the passing trade. Until the town developed as an industrial area, nurseries were prominent in the local economy; the Cox&#x27;s Orange Pippin apple was first raised in Colnbrook (not then within Slough) around 1825, and the dianthus &quot;Mrs Sinkins Pink&quot; was first raised at some point between 1868 and 1883 by John Sinkins, the master of the Eton Union Workhouse, which lay in Slough.

In the mid-19th century, the only major employer apart from the brickfields was James Elliman, who started as a draper in Chandos Street. In 1847, he changed business and manufactured his Elliman&#x27;s Embrocation and Royal Embrocation horse liniment at factories in Wellington Street and Chandos Street. Elliman became a major benefactor to the town, and is remembered today in the names of local roads and schools.

In September 1851, William Thomas Buckland, an auctioneer and surveyor from nearby Wraysbury, began livestock sales in a field near the Great Western Road Railway Station belonging to the North Star Inn. Originally held on the first Tuesday of every month, the Cattle Market&#x27;s popularity soon saw this increased to every Tuesday. A move to Wexham Street was necessitated by the postwar redevelopment of the town. The Slough Cattle Market was run by Messrs Buckland and Sons until its final closure in 1988.

In 1906, James Horlick, one of the founders of the eponymous malted milk company, opened a purpose-built red-brick factory near Slough Railway Station to manufacture his malted milk product. In 2015, the business was sold by Glaxo Smith Kline and in 2017, manufacturing at the site ceased altogether. The site is currently proposed to become residential making use of the original buildings as much as possible.

Starting in the 1920s, Slough Estates Ltd, the operator of the original Slough Trading Estate, created and operated many more estates in the UK and abroad. The Slough Trading Estate meant that the town was largely insulated from many of the effects of recession. For many years, Slough&#x27;s economy was mainly manufacturing-based. The company Zwicky Limited, a manufacturer of liquid pumps, filters, compression valves and aircraft refuelling units, runway sweepers were based in Slough.

In the last 20 or so years, there has been a major shift from a manufacturing to an information-based economy, with the closure of many factories (some of which had been in Slough for many decades). The factories are rapidly being replaced by office buildings. Hundreds of major companies have sited in Slough Trading Estate over the years, with its proximity to London Heathrow Airport and good motorway connections being attractive. In the 1960s, Gerry Anderson&#x27;s film company was based in Slough, and his Supermarionation series, including &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, were filmed there.

The UK headquarters of Mars, Incorporated is in Slough, the main factory having been established in 1932 by Forrest Mars Sr. and Frank C. Mars. It produced the Mars Bar in Slough over 70 years ago. One of the Mars factories has been demolished and some production has moved to the Czech Republic. The European head offices of major IT companies such as BlackBerry, McAfee, Computer Associates, PictureTel and Compusys (among others) are all in the town. O2 is headquartered in the town across four buildings. The town is also home to the business support organisation Thames Valley Chamber of Commerce Group and National Foundation for Educational Research, which is housed in the Mere.

Recent new offices include those of Nintendo, Black and Decker and Abbey business centres. The registered office of Furniture Village lies in the town.

The motor trade has long been represented in Slough. Until 1966, Citroën assembled cars in a Liverpool Road factory (later used by Mars Confectionery), and it retains its UK headquarters in the town. Ford built D Series and Cargo lorries at its factory in Langley (a former Hawker Aircraft site) from 1936 to the 1950s until the site was redeveloped for housing in the 1990s. Ferrari, Mercedes, Fiat and Maserati now have offices in the town.

==Transport==
===Road===

Located roughly west of Central London, Slough is a commuter town near Heathrow Airport ( south-east), Uxbridge ( north-east), Maidenhead ( west) and Staines ( south-east). Slough residents also commute to Windsor, Reading and Bracknell as well as Central London. There are large passenger movements in the morning and evening rush hours.

The Western Rail Approach to Heathrow is a £500m rail project announced by the Department for Transport; Network Rail announced the route in 2014. It will directly serve Slough with four trains every hour, reducing travel times to Heathrow to six minutes. It is expected to be operational in the early 2020s.

===Cycling===
National Cycle Network route 61 runs through central Slough. A Smoove bike sharing system was launched in October 2013, targeting commuters travelling between the trading estate and nearby railway stations.

===Canal===
Slough is connected by the Slough Arm to the main line of the Grand Union Canal which runs between the Thames at Brentford and Birmingham. It travels from the terminus basin at Stoke Road to the junction with the main line at Cowley Peachey; it was restored to navigability in 1975 having been disused since 1960.

==Sports==
Slough has a senior non-League football team, Slough Town F.C., who currently play in the National League South. Slough also host the ice hockey team, the Slough Jets. They play in NIHL South Division 1.

Reading F.C. Womens and Republic of Ireland Womens goalkeeper Grace Moloney was born and lives in the town.

==Education==

There are numerous primary and secondary schools serving Slough. Of the latter there are four state grammar schools. In addition, East Berkshire College has a campus in the area. Slough schools are in the top 10 best performers in the country at GCSE level. In 2011, 68.1% of pupils left school with a minimum of 5 A*-C grades (with English and maths). The national average is 58.9%.

Thames Valley University (Slough Campus) is currently closed due to the Heart of Slough project. The new campus was scheduled to be opened in 2013 as part of the University of West London, but as of March 2022 there had been no progress, as the former site of the university had been sold for housing.

==Cultural references==

* 1597: In Act IV, Scene 5 of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;, Bardolph is mugged: &quot;so soon as I came beyond Eton, (cozeners) threw me off, from behind one of them, in a slough of mire&quot;. This could be a reference to Slough. In the same scene Cole-brooke (Colnbrook) is referenced along with Reading and Maidenhead.
* 1872: Edward Lear made reference to Slough in &quot;More Nonsense Pictures, Rhymes, Botany, etc&quot;:
::&quot;There was an old person of Slough,&quot;
::&quot;Who danced at the end of a bough;&quot;
::&quot;But they said, &#x27;If you sneeze,&quot;
::&quot;You might damage the trees,&quot;
::&quot;You imprudent old person of Slough.&quot;&#x27;
* 1932: (but set in the 26th century) In Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot;, the chimneys of Slough Crematorium, around which Bernard Marx flies, are used to demonstrate the physio-chemical equality of all people. (Slough&#x27;s actual crematorium, in the cemetery in Stoke Road, was opened in 1963, coincidentally the year of Huxley&#x27;s death. Princess Margaret was cremated there in 2002.)
* 1937: The poet John Betjeman wrote his poem &quot;Slough&quot; as a protest against the new town and 850 factories that had arisen in what had been formerly a rural area, which he considered an onslaught on the rural lifestyle:
::&quot;Come, friendly bombs and fall on Slough&quot;
::&quot;It isn&#x27;t fit for humans now&quot;
::&quot;There isn&#x27;t grass to graze a cow.&quot;
::&quot;Swarm over, death!&quot;
:The poem was published two years before the outbreak of the Second World War, in which Britain (including Slough itself) experienced bombing from enemy air raids. On the centenary of his birth, his daughter said her father &quot;regretted having ever written it&quot;, presenting the Mayor David MacIsaac with a book of his poems in which she had written: &quot;We love Slough&quot;.
* 1979: Slough is mentioned by name in the hit single &quot;The Eton Rifles&quot; by the Jam from the album &quot;Setting Sons&quot;: &quot;There&#x27;s a row going on down near Slough&quot;
* 1991: Film &quot;Buddy&#x27;s Song&quot; with externals filmed mainly on the Britwell Estate and the Farnham Road (A355) released.
* 1996: The Tiger Lillies&#x27; album &quot;The Brothel to the Cemetery&quot; includes a track called &quot;Slough&quot;, probably inspired by Betjeman&#x27;s poem. The lyrics to the chorus are:
::&quot;Drop a bomb on Slough, Drop a bomb on Slough&quot;
::&quot;Drop a bomb on Slough, Drop a bomb on Slough&quot;
* 1998: The song &quot;Costa del Slough&quot; by the rock band Marillion posits the town as a post-global warming coastal resort, possibly in a reference to the comedian Spike Milligan having presented Slough on TV as a holiday resort.
* 2001: The BBC comedy series &quot;The Office&quot; was set in the sales office of a paper company in Slough, presenting it as a depressing post-industrial wasteland. The character David Brent comments on Betjeman&#x27;s poem in the series, which also appears on the inside sleeve of the video and DVD of Series 1. In the US version, the office is located on &quot;Slough Avenue&quot; in Scranton, Pennsylvania.
* 2004: Slough is mentioned on the ABC series &quot;Lost&quot; in the episode &quot;Homecoming&quot; of Season 1. In a flashback of Charlie&#x27;s life, a woman he knows says her father is away purchasing a paper company in Slough.

The name derives from the fact that, as Slough is distant from London, similarly Slough House is equally far away from the headquarters of MI5 in Regents Park for the disgraced spies hoping to revive their careers.
* 2015: Sky One comedy drama series &quot;You, Me and the Apocalypse&quot; is set in Slough where a nuclear bunker is located underneath the Slough Trading Estate. Aerial views are seen of Slough throughout the series.
* 2016: Ricky Gervais, in his role as David Brent, released the song &quot;Slough&quot; on his album &quot;Life on the Road,&quot; the soundtrack to the film by the same title. The chorus runs:

::&quot;My kind of town&quot;
::&quot;I don&#x27;t know how&quot;
::&quot;Anyone could put you down&quot;

==Crime==

Slough has a relatively high crime rate; figures for all crime categories are annually above the English average and figures for a few categories are at more than double the frequency. According to British Crime Survey statistics, as of September 2013, Slough had the second worst rate of crime among local authority areas in the Thames Valley Police counties (87 recorded crimes per 1,000 population vs Oxford&#x27;s 104). However the borough&#x27;s crime rate reduced by 29% in the ten years to 2013. In the year ending September 2017, the crime rate in Slough was the third highest in the Thames Valley force area, behind Reading (96.42 police recorded crimes per 1000 population) and Oxford (100.71 for the same metric).

<text>Jean-Michel André Jarre (; born 24 August 1948) is a French composer, performer and record producer. He is a pioneer in the electronic, ambient and new-age genres, and is known for organising outdoor spectacles featuring his music, accompanied by vast laser displays, large projections and fireworks.

Jarre was raised in Lyon by his mother and grandparents and trained on the piano. From an early age, he was introduced to a variety of art forms, including street performers, jazz musicians and the artist Pierre Soulages. His musical style was perhaps most heavily influenced by Pierre Schaeffer, a pioneer of musique concrète at the Groupe de Recherches Musicales.

His first mainstream success was the 1976 album &quot;Oxygène&quot;. Recorded in a makeshift studio at his home, the album sold an estimated 18 million copies. &quot;Oxygène&quot; was followed in 1978 by &quot;Équinoxe&quot;, and in 1979, Jarre performed to a record-breaking audience of more than a million people at the Place de la Concorde, a record he has since broken three times. More albums followed, but his 1979 concert served as a blueprint for his future performances around the world. Several of his albums have been released to coincide with large-scale outdoor events.

As of 2004, Jarre had sold an estimated 80 million albums and singles. He was the first Western musician officially invited to perform in the People&#x27;s Republic of China and held the world record for the largest-ever audience at an outdoor event for his Moscow concert on 6 September 1997, which was attended by 3.5 million people.

==Biography==

===Early life, influences, and education===
Jean-Michel Jarre was born in Lyon on 24 August 1948, to Francette Pejot, a French Resistance member and concentration camp survivor, and composer Maurice Jarre. His grandmother was Jewish. When Jarre was five, his parents separated and his father moved to the United States, leaving him with his mother. He did not see his father again until reaching the age of 18. 

For the first eight years of his life, Jarre spent six months each year at his maternal grandparents&#x27; flat on the Cours de Verdun, in the Perrache district of Lyon. Jarre&#x27;s grandfather was an oboe player, engineer and inventor, designing an early audio mixer used at Radio Lyon. He also gave Jean-Michel his first tape recorder. From his vantage point high above the pavement, the young Jarre was able to observe street performers at work, an experience he later cited as proving influential on his art.

Jarre struggled with classical piano studies, although he later changed teachers and worked on his scales. A more general interest in musical instruments was sparked by his discovery at the Saint-Ouen flea market, where his mother sold antiques, of a Boris Vian trumpet violin. He often accompanied his mother to Le Chat Qui Pêche (The Fishing Cat), a Paris jazz club run by one of her friends from her resistance years, where saxophonists Archie Shepp and John Coltrane, and trumpet players Don Cherry and Chet Baker were regular performers. These early jazz experiences suggested to him that music may be &quot;descriptive, without lyrics&quot;. 

He was also influenced by the work of French artist Pierre Soulages, whose exhibition at the Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris he attended. Soulages&#x27; paintings used multiple textured layers, and Jarre realised that &quot;for the first time in music, you could act as a painter with frequencies and sounds.&quot; He was also influenced by classical, modernist music. In a 2004 interview for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, he spoke of the effect that a performance of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; had upon him:

As a young man Jarre earned money by selling his paintings, exhibiting some of his works at the Lyon Gallery – &quot;L&#x27;Œil écoute&quot;, and by playing in a band called Mystère IV. While he studied at the Lycée Michelet, his mother arranged for him to take lessons in harmony, counterpoint and fugue with Jeannine Rueff of the Conservatoire de Paris. In 1967 he played guitar in a band called &quot;The Dustbins&quot;, who appear in the film &quot;&quot;. He mixed instruments including the electric guitar and the flute with tape effects and other sounds. 

More experimentation followed in 1968, when he began to use tape loops, radios and other electronic devices. In 1969, he joined the Groupe de Recherches Musicales (GRM), founded and led by Pierre Schaeffer, inventor of musique concrete. Jarre was introduced to the Moog modular synthesizer and spent time working at the studio of influential German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen in Cologne.

In the kitchen of his apartment in Rue de la Trémoille, Jarre set up a small makeshift recording studio. It included his first synthesiser, an EMS VCS 3, and an EMS Synthi AKS, each linked to Revox tape machines. For a 1969 exposition at the Maison de la Culture (Cultural House) in Reims, Jarre wrote the five-minute experimental instrumental &quot;Happiness Is a Sad Song&quot;. That same year he composed and recorded &quot;La Cage/Erosmachine&quot;, a mixture of harmony, tape effects and synthesisers, which was released in 1971.

===1970s===

In 1971 Jarre was commissioned by choreographer Norbert Schmucki to perform a ballet called &quot;AOR&quot; (in Hebrew, &quot;the light&quot;), at the Palais Garnier. He also composed background music for ballet, theatre, television programs, department stores, and advertising jingles for Pepsi-Cola, Nestlé and RTL. The music for airports, and North America libraries was composed with the VCS 3 and a Farfisa professional organ. From 1972 to 1975, Jean-Michel wrote music and lyrics for artists like Françoise Hardy, Gérard Lenorman, Christophe and Patrick Juvet. In 1972 he collaborated in an Olympia show, and wrote music for the International Festival of Magic. In 1972 he also released his first solo album, &quot;Deserted Palace&quot;, and composed the soundtrack for &quot;Les Granges Brûlées&quot; (English: &quot;The Burned Barns&quot;).

Jarre&#x27;s 1976 low-budget solo album &quot;Oxygène&quot;, recorded at his home studio, made him famous internationally. The music was made with analog synthesizers like the EMS VCS 3 and the EMS Synthi AKS, and recorded with a Scully 8-track recorder. Jarre initially was turned down by several record companies, until Jean-Michel decided to meet with Francis Dreyfus, the head of the Disques Motors label, to see if he could release the album, to which he accepted. The first pressing of 50,000 copies was promoted through hi-fi shops, clubs and discos, and by April 1977 had sold 70,000 copies in France. When interviewed in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, Motors&#x27;s director Stanislas Witold said, &quot;In a sense we&#x27;re putting most of our bets on Jean-Michel Jarre. He is quite exceptional and we&#x27;re sure that by 1980 he will be recognised worldwide.&quot;

Jarre&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;Équinoxe&quot;, was released in 1978. Though its sales were still healthy, it had less of an impact than &quot;Oxygène&quot;. but in 1979 Jarre held a large open-air concert on Bastille Day, at the Place de la Concorde. The free outdoor event set a world record for the largest number of spectators ever at an open-air concert, drawing more than 1 million spectators. Although it was not the first time he had performed in concert (Jarre had already played at the Paris Opera Ballet), the 40 minute-long event, which used projections of light, images and fireworks, served as a blueprint for Jarre&#x27;s future concerts. Its popularity helped create a surge in sales—a further 800,000 records were sold between 14 July and 31 August 1979—and the Frenchman Francis Rimbert featured at the event.

===1980s===

By the time &quot;Les Chants Magnétiques&quot; was released on 20 May 1981, &quot;Oxygène&quot; and &quot;Équinoxe&quot; had achieved global sales of about 6 million units. In its first two months the new album sold 200,000 units in France alone. The album uses sounds from the Fairlight CMI, a new instrument of which Jarre was a pioneer. Its digital technology allowed him to continue his earlier sonic experimentation in new ways.

In that same year, the British Embassy gave Radio Beijing copies of &quot;Oxygène&quot;, &quot;Équinoxe&quot;, and &quot;Les Chants Magnétiques&quot;, which became the first pieces of foreign music to be played on Chinese national radio in decades. The Republic invited Jarre to become the first western musician to play in post-Mao Zedong China. The performances were scheduled to run from 18 October to 5 November 1981. 5 concerts were performed, two in Beijing and three in Shanghai. The first, in Beijing, was initially attended mostly by officials, but before the concert began, technicians realised that not enough power was available to supply the stage and auditorium. Chinese officials solved the problem by temporarily cutting power to the surrounding districts.

The stadium was almost full when the concert began, but as Beijing&#x27;s buses stopped running at about 10 o&#x27;clock, about half the audience left before it finished. To boost the audience attendance for the second night, Jarre and his production team purchased some of the concert tickets and gave them to children on the streets. Jarre originally wanted the concerts to be free, but the Chinese authorities decided to charge between £0.20 and £0.50 per ticket. In 1982, recordings of the concerts, which featured one of Jarre&#x27;s signature electronic instruments, the laser harp, were released as a double-disc LP.

Between February and May 1983, Jarre recorded a single LP copy of an album entitled &quot;Musique pour Supermarché&quot; (English: &quot;Music for Supermarkets&quot;) whose objective was to be the soundtrack of a show called Orrimbe, to later be auctioned with the master tapes and plates destroyed. The album was later broadcast exclusively on Radio Luxembourg with Jarre encouraging listeners to record the broadcast.

In 1984, he released seventh studio album &quot;Zoolook&quot;. In this album he expanded the sample-based approach which had been initiated on &quot;Les Chants Magnétiques&quot; and continued on &quot;Music for Supermarkets&quot;. The album was based around multiple fragments of human voices pronouncing words and speeches in different languages from all over the world, recorded digitally by Jarre and then played back and edited on the Fairlight CMI.
In 1985, Jarre was invited by the musical director of the Houston Grand Opera to perform a concert celebrating Texas&#x27;s 150th anniversary on 5 April 1986. Although he was busy with other projects and was at first unimpressed by the proposal, on a later visit to the city, he was immediately impressed by the visual grandeur of the city&#x27;s skyline and agreed to perform. Also, 1985 marked the 25th anniversary of the foundation of the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center; and NASA asked Jarre to integrate the anniversary into the concert.

Jarre worked with several Houston-based astronauts, including Bruce McCandless II and Ronald McNair, an accomplished musician who was to have played the saxophone on &quot;Rendez-Vous VI&quot;, recorded in the weightless environment of space. The live performance was curtailed by McNair&#x27;s death in the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster on 28 January 1986. Consideration was given to the cancellation of the concert; but McCandless contacted Jarre and urged him to proceed, in memory of the shuttle&#x27;s crew. McNair&#x27;s saxophone piece was recorded by French saxophonist Pierre Gossez and retitled &quot;Ron&#x27;s Piece&quot;. At Jarre&#x27;s giant concerts in Houston and Lyon, the part was performed by McNair&#x27;s friend, American saxophonist Kirk Whalum:

About 2,000 projectors shone images onto buildings and giant screens up to high, transforming the city&#x27;s skyscrapers into spectacular backdrops for an elaborate display of fireworks and lasers. Rendez-vous Houston entered the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; for its audience of over 1.5 million, beating his earlier record, set in 1979. The display was so impressive that a nearby freeway was blocked by passing vehicles, forcing the authorities to close it for the duration of the concert. Several months later he performed to an audience of about a million at his home city of Lyon, in celebration of a visit by Pope John Paul II. Watching from Lyon Cathedral, the Pope began the concert with a good-night blessing, a recording of which appears on &quot;Cities in Concert – Houston/Lyon&quot;.

In 1988, Jarre released his ninth studio album &quot;Revolutions&quot;, and in same year, a concert called Destination Docklands was planned for September, to be held at the Royal Victoria Dock in east London. Close to the heart of London, the location was chosen in part for its desolate environment, but also because Jarre thought the architecture was ideally suited for his music. Early in 1988 Jarre met with local officials and members of the community, but Newham Borough Council delayed their decision until 12 September, the month in which the show was due to take place. The local fire service were also concerned about access in the event of a fire. Site work continued as Jarre&#x27;s team searched for alternative locations in which to stage the concert, but following improvements to both on and off-site safety Jarre eventually won conditional approval on 28 September to stage two separate performances, on 8 and 9 October.

The floating stage on which Jarre and his musicians performed was built on top of four large barges. Large purpose-built display screens were built, and one of the buildings to be used as a backdrop was painted white. One large mirror ball being transported to the event fell onto the roadside, causing a degree of confusion as some people mistook it for a fallen satellite. World War II searchlights were installed, to illuminate the sky and surrounding architecture. 

Along with thousands in the surrounding streets and parks, 200,000 people watched Jarre and guests such as guitarist Hank Marvin perform in less than ideal conditions. Inclement weather had threatened to break the stage from its moorings, putting paid to the original plan to float the stage across the Royal Victoria Dock. Wind speeds were so high that television cameras were blown over. On the second evening the audience, which included Diana, Princess of Wales, was soaked by rain and wind.

===1990s===
In 1990, Jarre released &quot;En Attendant Cousteau&quot; (&quot;Waiting for Cousteau&quot;), a tribute to the French oceanographer Jacques-Yves Cousteau. On Bastille Day he performed a concert at La Défense in Paris, attended by a record-breaking audience of about two million people, again beating his earlier world record. He later promoted a concert near the Pyramids of Teotihuacan in Mexico, to be held during the solar eclipse of 11 July 1991. However, with only weeks to go, important equipment had not arrived and the sinking in the Atlantic Ocean of a cargo ship containing the purpose-built pyramidal stage and other technical and financial problems made staging the concert impossible. Jarre&#x27;s disappointment was such that he &quot;could not cope with Mexican food for two years&quot;.

About two years later he released &quot;Chronologie&quot;, an album that features Jarre&#x27;s traditional collection of instruments like the ARP 2600 and Minimoog, as well as newer synthesisers such as the Roland JD-800 and the Kurzweil K2000.


Jarre was invited to the inaugural celebrations of the Palace of the Lost City, a hotel located within the Sun City in South Africa. Three concerts were held on 1, 2 and 3 December 1992, in which more than 45,000 people attended.

&quot;Chronologie&quot; was performed at a series of 16 performances across Europe called &quot;Europe in Concert&quot;. These were on a smaller scale than his previous concerts, featuring a miniature skyline, laser imaging and fireworks. Locations included Lausanne, Mont St Michel, London, Manchester, Barcelona, Seville and the Versailles Palace near Paris. In March 1994, a concert was held in Hong Kong, to mark the opening of the city&#x27;s new stadium. 

Jarre performed many of his most well-known hits at the &quot;Concert for Tolerance&quot; on Bastille Day in 1995, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. The Eiffel Tower was specially lit for the occasion, prompting the installation of a more permanent display. The following December, he created the website &quot;A Space for Tolerance&quot;, which featured music from &quot;En Attendant Cousteau&quot;, played while the user browsed a variety of &quot;visual worlds&quot;.

In 1997, Jarre returned to the analogue synthesisers of the 1970s with &quot;Oxygène 7–13&quot;, dedicated to his mentor at the GRM, Pierre Schaeffer, who had died two years before. In September that year he set his fourth record for the largest-ever outdoor-concert audience with a performance at the Moscow State University, celebrating the 850th anniversary of Moscow. The event was viewed by an audience of about 3.5 million.

On September 18th 1998, during the 15th Paris Apple Expo&#x27;s &quot;iMac Night&quot;, Jarre, Apple brand ambassador and friend of Steve Jobs&#x27; created the first 3D concert, &quot;Electronic Odyssee&quot;, to mark the 50th anniversary of electronic music and the launch of the Apple iMac computer. It was enjoyed by 6000 spectators wearing special 3D glasses.

Another large-scale concert followed on 31 December 1999, in the Egyptian desert near Giza. The Twelve Dreams of the Sun celebrated the new millennium and offered a preview of his next album, &quot;Métamorphoses&quot;, released in 2000. The show featured performances from more than 1,000 local artists and musicians, and was based on ancient Egyptian mythology about the journey of the Sun and its effect upon humanity. In 1998, British commercial broadcaster ITV used a remixed version of &quot;Fourth Rendez-Vous&quot; (called Rendez-Vous 98) for their television coverage of the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France. British group Apollo 440 were credited alongside Jarre for the remix.

===2000s===

In 2001, he released &quot;Interior Music&quot;, an album of 1,000 copies created for use by the Danish audio-visual company Bang &amp; Olufsen stores. The album consists of two long-form pieces: &quot;Bonjour Hello&quot;, is a 25 minute audio collage of sounds with voices saying short sentences in French, English and Danish. The second piece, &quot;Whispers of Life&quot;, is an instrumental version of the first, with the voices removed.
In 2001 he composed, with Francis Rimbert arrangements, the music for the short-lived French channel Match TV. On 7 September 2002, Jarre held a very wet and muddy concert at the near the city of Aalborg in Denmark, with 40,000 spectators (including 5,000 VIPs). Danish band Safri Duo featured on the track &quot;Aero&quot;, which in fact was Bourges 2 from the performance earlier that year, and Rendez-Vous 4. The concert was broadcast live on various TV stations around the world and a shortened one-hour version was made available for rebroadcast.

By no fault of Jarre, due to 22 millimeters of rain and lack of proper preparation for and execution of the event, it took several hours for all people to be able to leave the area, and many cars were stuck until the next day. The problems became a big issue in Danish media, since, had there been an accident, it would be extremely difficult for help to get to the location. Two years previously, nine people were killed at Roskilde Festival, which had brought focus on security at large concerts. Preparations for AERO were later proven to have been lacking, and the police investigation concluded, in part, that permission for the concert should not have been granted. Reactions from spectators were mixed, some claiming it was unsafe, and others saying it was a case of overreacting.

A concert in September of that same year at a wind farm near Aalborg in Denmark proved problematic when 22 mm of rain fell on the venue, causing long delays for spectators. It also marked a change in direction in Jarre&#x27;s live concerts; from Rendez-vous Houston onwards he had been accompanied by a full complement of live musicians, but at Aalborg he was accompanied only by Francis Rimbert, and having guests like the Klarup Girls Choir, Safri Duo and the Aalborg Symphonic Orchestra.

In 2003 he released &quot;Geometry of Love&quot; on Warner Music label, it was commissioned by Jean-Roch as soundtrack for his &#x27;V.I.P. Room&#x27; nightclub in France. The physical CD was a long time out of print, but in 2018 remastered reissue was released on CD again. The album cover is a pixelated and turned counter-clockwise photo of Jarre&#x27;s girlfriend at the time, Isabelle Adjani.

In October 2004 he returned to China to open its &quot;Year of France&quot; cultural exchange. Jarre gave two performances, the first at the Meridian Gate of the Forbidden City, and the second in Tiananmen Square. More than 15,000 spectators watched the concert at the Meridian Gate, and each concert was transmitted nationwide on live television. Jarre collaborated with musician Chen Lin. Accompanying his traditional musical repertoire, 600 projectors shone coloured light and images across various screens and objects.

In September 2004, Jarre released both a DVD and a CD in one package &quot;AERO&quot;. A compilation album made in 5.1 surround sound, it contains re-recorded versions of some of his most famous tracks, including tracks from &quot;Oxygène&quot; and &quot;Équinoxe&quot;. Accompanying the audio, the DVD features a visual image of Anne Parillaud&#x27;s eyes, recorded in real time as she listened to the album. Jarre used the minimalist imagery to reinforce the audio content of the DVD.
In his role of UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador, Jarre performed a concert named Water for Life in Morocco, on 16 December 2006, to celebrate the United Nations Year of Desertification in the world. The performance was in front of the Erg Chebbi Dunes of Merzouga, in the Sahara. A free event, it was attended by about 25,000 people. Images of water and the environment were projected onto nine vertical screens, held in place by sand which was watered to keep it hard. Several permanent drinking fountains were built on the site, along with a permanent electricity installation. Jarre was accompanied by over 60 Moroccan artists. Jarre released &quot;Téo &amp; Téa&quot; in 2007, a studio album that described the different stages of a loving relationship.

In that same year released on EMI label a new recording of his 1976 album named &quot;Oxygène: New Master Recording&quot;. Jarre performed 10 concerts (&quot;Oxygène Live&quot;) in December 2007, held in the Théâtre Marigny, located in the Champs-Élysées, Paris. Later in 2008 Jarre performed several concerts to celebrate the 30th anniversary of &quot;Oxygène&quot;, in theaters in Europe. Following one such performance at the Royal Albert Hall Jarre met Queen guitarist Brian May, who proposed he create a concert in Tenerife for the International Year of Astronomy, but a lack of sponsorship meant that the concert did not take place. In 2009 he was selected as the artistic director of the World Sky Race, and also accepted a role as Goodwill Ambassador for the International Year of Astronomy. In 2009 he started an indoor tour in arenas throughout Europe.

===2010s===

On 1 March 2010, Jean-Michel Jarre started the second leg of his 2009–2010 Indoors tour; on 10 June, he was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award by &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine. On 1 July 2011, Jarre performed a large-scale concert in Monaco to celebrate the marriage of Prince Albert and his bride Charlene. A later concert was held at Carthage during the city&#x27;s 12 August 2013 musical festival.

In June 2013, Jarre was elected as president of the (CISAC). In Spring 2015, Jarre released the first music from a new studio album, released in October 2015, following around four years of work. The album, &quot;Electronica 1: The Time Machine&quot; (working title: &quot;E-Project&quot;), comprises a number of collaborations with other artists. The first of these to be released was the collaboration with Gesaffelstein entitled &quot;Conquistador&quot;, followed by &quot;Glory&quot;, with M83. The track was also featured as part of the soundtrack of a short film entitled &quot;EMIC&quot;.

Other collaborations on the album include Tangerine Dream for &quot;Zero Gravity&quot;; Armin van Buuren for &quot;Stardust&quot;, John Carpenter for &quot;A Question of Blood&quot;, Little Boots for &quot;If..!&quot; and Pete Townshend for &quot;Travelator, Pt. 2&quot;. The album became Jarre&#x27;s first album in over 25 years to make the UK Top 10 at No. 8. In December 2016, the album was nominated for the Grammys 2017 Awards in the &quot;Best Dance/Electronic Album&quot; category. In June 2015, in collaboration with Jean-Michel Jarre, the transmedia project &quot;Soundhunters&quot; was released on the platform of the Franco-German channel ARTE. The transmedia conceptualized by the Blies brothers (Stéphane Hueber-Blies and Nicolas Blies), François Le Gall and Marion Guth of the Luxembourg production company a_BAHN, is openly inspired by the album &quot;Zoolook&quot; to which it pays tribute.

On 5 October 2016, Democracy in Europe Movement 2025 announced that Jarre would be a member of its advisory panel. The transmedia is composed of a web documentary using &quot;Zoolook&quot;″s creative process involving 4 international artists (Simonne Jones, Mikael Seifu, Daedelus and Luke Vibert); a 52&#x27; documentary film directed by Beryl Koltz broadcast in September 2015 on ARTE (with the participation of Chassol, Matthew Herbert, Blixa Bargeld, Jean-Michel Jarre, Matmos, Kiz, Joseph Bertolozzi); and finally a participatory tribute music album whose tracks were chosen by Jean-Michel Jarre, entitled &quot;Zoolook Revisited&quot;. &quot;Soundhunters&quot; won the Fipa d&#x27;Or 2015 in Biarritz. &quot;Soundhunters&quot; was also presented in conference at SXSW and Convergence NYFF 2016.

In 2016, &quot;Electronica 2: The Heart of Noise&quot; was released with 15 more collaborators, including Pet Shop Boys, Hans Zimmer, Yello and Gary Numan. One track (8 &quot;Exit&quot;) includes speech by Edward Snowden. &quot;Electronica 2&quot; has been nominated in the &quot;Album de musiques électroniques ou dance&quot; category for the Grammy 2017 in USA &amp; Victoires de la Musique 2017 awards in France. On 11 April 2016, it was revealed that Jarre worked in collaboration with British virtual band Gorillaz on their fifth studio album &quot;Humanz&quot;. He also composed during 2016 the soundtrack for the French news network France Info. This soundtrack was released as &quot;Radiophonie Vol. 9&quot; on 13 January 2017.

In 2017, he performed a concert near the fortress of Masada, for the purpose of saving the Dead Sea and to highlight &quot;the anti-environmental policies of Donald Trump.&quot; He also performed a special concert for the opening of the &quot;Año Jubilar&quot; (Jubilee year) at the Monasterio de Santo Toribio de Liébana, in Spain. Both concerts were heavily based in the Electronica Tour concept. During May 2017, Jarre toured in Canada and USA for the first time in his career, and in July 2017 another leg of the tour was held in Europe.

In March 2018, Jarre performed in South America for the first time as part of his Electronica Tour in Buenos Aires and Santiago de Chile. These concerts were originally scheduled for November 2017, but problems with the production company caused the rescheduling. The 2018 leg of the tour continued in Canada and the United States during April, including the presentation of the Electronica show with a reduced track list in the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, ending with a one-off concert at Riyadh to celebrate the 88th Saudi National Day (23 September). This concert was called &quot;The Green Concert&quot;, and involved laser projections on the skyscrapers of the financial center of Riyadh. In September 2018, a studio compilation album entitled &quot;Planet Jarre – 50 Years of Music&quot;, consisting of forty-one songs in &quot;four quite different styles of composition&quot;, was released.

On 26 November 2018, Jarre and Scott Kirkland of The Crystal Method announced that they would be collaborating on a track on Jarre&#x27;s next &quot;Electronica&quot; album. In January 2019, HSBC revealed their new musical identity, composed by Jarre. On 3 October 2019, French editor Robert Laffont published Melancolique Rodeo, Jarre&#x27;s autobiography. Jarre started a promotional tour for his book. On 7 November 2019, Jarre announced the release of an application for the iOS operating system named EōN. This application contains morphing graphics created by an algorithm developed by Alexis André of Sony Computer Science Laboratories, and music generated from 7 hours of recorded material by Jarre. This music is always different on every device. The AI algorithm which composes on the fly based on the rules set by Jarre was developed by BLEASS. A limited deluxe box set was later released with excerpts from the application.

=== 2020–present ===

On 31 December 2020, Jarre held a virtual New Year&#x27;s Eve concert online. He performed from a studio in Paris, but it appeared virtually from a Notre Dame setting. The show has had over 75 million viewers as of 5 January 2021. The show was done in support of his new album &quot;Welcome to the other side,&quot; which features 12 tracks from his previously released music. The recording of the concert was released on CD, LP and Blu-ray in September 2021. VR Concert created by VRROOM received 2 Webby Award Honoree, Crystal Owl Award for the Best Live Entertainment, and Social Music Award.

On 21 June 2021, Jarre was awarded Commander to the Legion of Honour by French president Emmanuel Macron at the Elysée presidential palace in Paris. After the ceremony he performed at the same venue as part of the Fête de la Musique. In March 2022 Jarre presented a live project, &quot;Oxymore&quot;, at Radio France&#x27;s Hyper Weekend Festival located at Paris. 

His twenty-second studio album &quot;Oxymore&quot; was released on 21 October 2022 by Sony Music and Menart Records as a tribute to Pierre Henry. Some songs were accompanied by a remix created by different artists such as Brian Eno, Nina Kraviz, Armin van Buuren, the first single from the album, &quot;Brutalism&quot;, was released along with a remix made by Depeche Mode member Martin Gore. 

OXYMORE was created as multiformat concert in VR by VRROOM Team and received Webby People&#x27;s Voice Award in 2023 and Webby Nomination and Honoree in 2022, Crystal Owl Award for Best Production Design, Raindance Immersive Honourable Jury Mentioning, as well as nomination for the Producers Guild of America&#x27;s Innovation Award. In July 2022, his music publishing catalog was acquired by BMG Rights Management.

On 25 December 2023, Jarre held a concert in the Hall of Mirrors of Versailles to celebrate the 400 years of the palace. This was released in October 2024 as a limited edition &quot;phydigital&quot; (hybrid physical and digital release) in either vinyl or CD (with a limited edition of 2000 for each format, the vinyl being numbered on the sleeve), which as well as the physical medium which provided the owner with &quot;a truly unique digital experience,&quot; accessible by phone through a custom NFC sticker embedded inside the CD or vinyl sleeve.

It also included a lossless audio streaming version with an electro rendition of JB Lully&#x27;s &quot;Walk to the Turcs Ceremony,&quot; the recent single &quot;Epica Oxygene,&quot; and fresh versions of existing tracks. In the greeting from Jarre&#x27;s avatar, Jarre said that they would be updating the content twice.

On 8 September 2024, Jarre performed at the closing ceremony of the 2024 Summer Paralympics.

== Flying aircar mission ==
In April 2024, Jean-Michel Jarre became the world’s first passenger to take off in Klein Vision’s flying AirCar.

==Personal life==
Jarre was married to Flore Guillard from 1975 until 1977. 

He met his second wife, actress Charlotte Rampling, at a dinner party in Saint-Tropez in 1976. The two married. Jarre and Rampling separated in 1996 and divorced in 2002. Jarre gained custody of his daughter Émilie Charlotte. Rampling gained custody of her son Barnaby. Together Jarre and Rampling had a son, David. 

He had a brief relationship with Isabelle Adjani, and married French actress Anne Parillaud in May 2005. In November 2010 the couple announced their divorce. 

Jarre started dating Chinese actress Gong Li in 2016. They got married in 2019, and have kept the relationship private.

Jarre has a half-sister, Stéphanie Jarre, from one of Maurice Jarre&#x27;s other marriages. His stepbrother, Kevin Jarre, died in 2011. Although Maurice and Jean-Michel remained estranged, following Maurice&#x27;s death in 2009, Jarre paid tribute to his legacy.

Jarre said about his father: &quot;My father and I never really achieved a real relationship. We probably saw each other 20 or 25 times in our lifetime. When you are able, at my age, to count the times you have seen your father, it says something. (...) I think it&#x27;s better to have conflict, or, if you have a parent who dies, you grieve, but the feeling of absence is very difficult to fill, and it took me a while to absorb that&quot;.

<doc id="45224" wikidata="Q547279" url="?curid=45224" title="Animal Crackers (1930 film)">
<text>Animal Crackers is a 1930 American pre-Code Marx Brothers comedy film directed by Victor Heerman. The film stars the Marx Brothers, (Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo), with Lillian Roth and Margaret Dumont, based on the Marxes’ Broadway musical of the same name. Mayhem and zaniness ensue during a weekend party in honor of famed African explorer Captain Jeffrey T. Spaulding. A critical and commercial success upon its initial release, &quot;Animal Crackers&quot; was shot at Paramount&#x27;s Astoria Studios in Astoria, Queens, the second film the Brothers would make in New York City.

&quot;Animal Crackers&quot; was adapted from the successful 1928 Broadway musical of the same title by George S. Kaufman and Morrie Ryskind, also starring the Marx Brothers and Margaret Dumont. Also reprising their Broadway roles were Margaret Irving as Mrs. Whitehead and Robert Greig as Hives, the butler. Greig appeared with the Marx Brothers again in &quot;Horse Feathers&quot; (1932).

== Plot == 
Society matron Mrs. Rittenhouse is hosting a lavish party at her home on Long Island. The guest of honor is renowned explorer Captain Geoffrey (or Jeffrey) T. Spaulding, just returned from Africa. Also, the famous art collector Roscoe W. Chandler will unveil his recently acquired painting, &quot;After The Hunt,&quot; by an artist named Beaugard.

Capt. Spaulding makes a grand entrance and announces that he cannot stay and must leave immediately (singing &quot;Hello, I Must Be Going&quot;). Signor Emanuel Ravelli, hired to provide music for the party, arrives followed a few moments later by his &quot;partner&quot; the Professor.
Mrs. Rittenhouse&#x27;s daughter Arabella devises a scheme for Chandler to notice her fiancé John Parker&#x27;s artistic talent and sponsor him: they&#x27;ll replace the Beaugard painting with an almost perfect copy of it John painted as an art student. Arabella asks Ravelli to switch the paintings. Meanwhile, another weekend party guest, the socially prominent Grace Carpenter, thinks up the very same idea with her older sister, Mrs. Whitehead, as a means of humiliating Mrs. Rittenhouse. Grace also copied the painting as an art student and asks Hives to replace the Beaugard with Grace&#x27;s poor copy, unaware that they are removing John&#x27;s copy.

Ravelli and the Professor run into Chandler and recognize him as &quot;Abie the fish man&quot;, who really hails from Czechoslovakia. Later that night, a thunderstorm has put out the lights and Ravelli and the Professor attempt to replace the Beaugard. In the middle of the job, Capt. Spaulding and Mrs. Rittenhouse wander in.

During the party, the painting is unveiled. Chandler immediately notices the poor quality and realizes someone has stolen his painting. John feels discouraged, thinking the painting is still his copy. Suddenly the lights go out again, and when restored, the imitation Beaugard is missing as well.

The next day, the police arrive to search for the missing painting. John finds Grace&#x27;s copy of the Beaugard and reveals to Arabella that someone else must have had the same idea to switch paintings. After getting the painting back from the Professor, John and Arabella bring it to Capt. Spaulding. The Professor is apprehended, and the three paintings are returned. Chandler momentarily mistakes John&#x27;s copy for the genuine Beaugard. Realizing his talent, Chandler hires John to do a series of portraits for him. The Professor, escaping arrest, sprays the guests with a knockout substance from a Flit gun. After everyone is laid out on the floor and fully subdued, the film concludes with the Professor knocking himself out.

== Jokes ==
Four of Groucho&#x27;s best-known quips:
*&quot;One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got in my pajamas, I don&#x27;t know.&quot;
::(The American Film Institute listed this at number 53 in the 100 Greatest Movie Quotes of All Time.)
*&quot;Then, we tried to remove the tusks, ... but they were embedded in so firmly, we couldn&#x27;t budge them. Of course, in Alabama the Tusk-a-loosa. But that&#x27;s entirely ir-elephant to what I was talking about.&quot;
*&quot;Africa is God&#x27;s country – and He can have it.&quot;
*&quot;We took some pictures of the native girls, but they weren&#x27;t developed. But we&#x27;re going back again in a couple of weeks!&quot;

Other quotes from Groucho:
*&quot;Ever since I met you, I&#x27;ve swept you off my feet.&quot;
*&quot;You mind if I don&#x27;t smoke?&quot;
*&quot;There&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve always wanted to do before I quit: Retire.&quot;
*&quot;I was outside the cabin smoking some meat. There wasn&#x27;t a cigar store in the neighborhood!&quot;
*&quot;Didn&#x27;t you ever see a Habeas Corpus?&quot; Chico: &quot;No, but I see Habeas Irish Rose.&quot;

The film also contains the well-known Chico–Harpo scene in which Chico keeps asking Harpo for &quot;a flash&quot; (meaning a flashlight), and Harpo – not understanding – produces from his bottomless trenchcoat and baggy pants a fish, a flask, a flute, a &quot;flit&quot;, a &quot;flush&quot;, etc.

Zeppo figures in a well-known scene in which Groucho dictates a letter to his lawyers in rambling pseudo-legalese. Zeppo gets to one-up Groucho: When asked to read the letter back, Zeppo informs him, &quot;You said a lot of things I didn&#x27;t think were very important, so I just omitted them!&quot; whereupon a minor skirmish ensues: what he&#x27;s omitted is the body of the letter. (Joe Adamson, in &quot;Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and Sometimes Zeppo&quot;, observed that this scene disproved the common notion that Zeppo was the least of the Marx Brothers: &quot;It takes a Marx Brother to pull something like that on a Marx Brother and get away with it.&quot;)

One more complex running joke has Groucho turning the dialogue into a scene out of the Eugene O&#x27;Neill play, &quot;Strange Interlude&quot;, in which the characters continually spoke asides that convey their thoughts. Groucho&#x27;s voice becomes deep and droning as he steps apart from the other characters to comment on the scene:Living with your folks. Living with your folks. The beginning of the end. Drab dead yesterdays shutting out beautiful tomorrows. Hideous, stumbling footsteps creaking along the misty corridors of time. And in those corridors I see figures, strange figures, weird figures: Steel 186, Anaconda 74, American Can 138 ...
The comedy, thus, is in the unpredictable shifting of the scene&#x27;s meaning, from two socialite ladies and a world-famous explorer mingling at a party, to a parody of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s work, to a mimicking of a man reading out stock prices. Incidentally, Groucho had heavy investments in Anaconda Copper and after having lost everything in the stock market crash of 1929 experienced a bout of depression as well as insomnia.

In the final scene, Harpo uses a Flit gun to pacify an entire crowd, finally spraying Groucho, who falls unconscious to the ground. The current prints of the film have the &quot;Flit&quot; name blotted out, since Paramount Pictures didn&#x27;t get permission to use the trademarked name.

== Musical numbers ==
Groucho&#x27;s songs, &quot;Hello, I Must Be Going&quot; and &quot;Hooray for Captain Spaulding&quot;, both written by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby, became recurring themes for Groucho through the years. The latter song became the theme of Groucho&#x27;s radio and TV game show &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;. It referred to a real Captain Spaulding, an army officer arrested a few years earlier for selling cocaine to Hollywood residents. The original full version of &quot;Hooray for Captain Spaulding&quot; was edited in compliance to the Hays Code when it was re-released in 1936: the sexually suggestive line &quot;I think I&#x27;ll try and make her&quot; was removed – it came after Mrs. Rittenhouse&#x27;s line: &quot;He was the only white man to cover every acre.&quot; It was long believed that this footage had been lost forever, until a pre-Hays Code print was discovered in the archives of the British Film Institute. This forms the basis of Universal&#x27;s Blu-ray restoration, released in October 2016.

Ironically, Groucho used an even more risqué line in introducing Chico&#x27;s piano sequence: &quot;Signor Ravelli&#x27;s first selection will be, &#x27;Somewhere My Love Lies Sleeping&#x27;, with a male chorus.&quot; Chico&#x27;s own piano composition &quot;I&#x27;m Daffy over You&quot; would be played again in their next feature film, &quot;Monkey Business&quot;, in the film&#x27;s score and by Harpo on the harp.
*He&#x27;s One of Those Men (Hives and Footmen)
*I Represent the Captain (Zeppo)
*Hooray for Captain Spaulding Part I (The Cast)
*Hello, I Must Be Going (Groucho)
*Hooray for Captain Spaulding Part II (Cast)
*Why Am I So Romantic? (Arabella and John, and as a harp interlude with Harpo)
*I&#x27;m Daffy over You (Chico; the refrain is sometimes confused with the 1950s song &quot;Sugar in the Morning&quot;)
*Silver Threads Among the Gold (Chico)
*Brief piano interlude (Harpo)
*Gypsy-chorus (a.k.a. Anvil Chorus) (Chico)
*My Old Kentucky Home (Marx Brothers)

== Releases ==

The original 1930 film release ran 99 minutes. In 1936, the film was reissued with several small cuts to accommodate the Production Code. This version ran about 98 minutes.

Paramount Pictures did not originally contract for renewal rights to the play and did not renegotiate when they were due to expire. Therefore, the studio&#x27;s rights to the play expired in 1956 and reverted to the authors of the Broadway stage play: the playwrights George S. Kaufman and Morrie Ryskind, the composer Harry Ruby, and the lyricist Bert Kalmar. When MCA Inc. acquired the rights to the film in 1958, they also tried to secure the rights to the play but would not meet Kaufman&#x27;s and Ryskind&#x27;s financial demands.

These legal restrictions prevented the film from being televised in the United States, but it &quot;could&quot; be televised in Canada, outside the restricted area. (The same situation prevailed in 1968, when stage rights forced MCA to withdraw the Olsen and Johnson comedy &quot;Hellzapoppin&quot;&#x27; from TV distribution in America, but not Canada.) &quot;Animal Crackers&quot; had not been seen in the United States since playing neighborhood theaters in reissue (alongside &quot;Duck Soup&quot;) in 1949. Marx Brothers fans were unable to see &quot;Animal Crackers&quot; until 16mm copies of a Canadian TV print began circulating on the collectors&#x27; market. Some theaters took a chance on showing these inferior, unauthorized copies to paying audiences, but these revivals were not heavily publicized and escaped MCA&#x27;s notice.

One of these screenings took place at the Old Town Music Hall theater in Anaheim, California, in December 1973. UCLA student and Marx Brothers fan Steve Stoliar attended the screening, and impulsively contacted Groucho Marx to enlist his support for an unlikely campaign to attempt to persuade — or pressure — Universal to re-release the film. Groucho agreed to appear at the UCLA campus for a publicity event. On February 7, 1974, Groucho and his assistant, Erin Fleming, visited UCLA under the aegis of Stoliar&#x27;s newly formed &quot;Committee for the Re-release of Animal Crackers&quot; (CRAC). The event drew around 200 students, over 2,000 signatures on re-release petitions, and several reporters. Universal scrambled to appear responsive: a spokesman told a &quot;UCLA Daily Bruin&quot; reporter that the studio was &quot;delighted&quot; by the interest, and that &quot;we have negotiated with the heirs of the writers (Morrie Ryskind and George S. Kaufman), but they were asking much more than we wanted to spend. Just recently we reached an agreement, and we&#x27;re waiting to sign the contracts.&quot; (Not quite: Ryskind was still in the pre-heir stage – he lived until 1985. The songwriter Harry Ruby was also alive, though he died only two weeks later, aged 79.) The spokesman added that he expected the film would soon be released. As the &quot;Daily Bruin&quot; put it, &quot;The rest of the day belonged to Groucho, as he showed surprising flashes of his old brilliance.&quot; Asked to name his favorite comedian, he said: &quot;Me.&quot; He also said that &quot;&quot;Animal Crackers&quot; is the best of our movies.&quot;

Groucho&#x27;s UCLA appearance generated national press coverage. An appearance on the nationally syndicated &quot;Merv Griffin Show&quot; soon followed. In April 1974, Groucho and Stoliar &quot;received an answer from Universal. According to Vice President Arnold Shane, they were &#x27;delighted with the response of the students.&#x27;&quot; On May 23, 1974, attempting to gauge public interest, Universal screened a sharp new print of the film at the UA Theater in Westwood, just south of the UCLA campus. Groucho made a personal appearance and walked unescorted into the theatre on the left aisle. People in the audience stood up and started applauding and soon the entire theater joined in. Encouraged by the response there – the lines stretched around the block for months — on June 23 the studio screened the film at the Sutton Theater in New York. Groucho attended the New York premiere. A near-riot broke out and a police escort was summoned. From there &quot;Animal Crackers&quot; went into national release.

Because of these rights issues, &quot;Animal Crackers&quot; had never been seen on television until July 21, 1979, when CBS broadcast a special showing of the film.

The complete, uncut &quot;Animal Crackers&quot;, which had only been available for decades in an edited version for the 1936 reissue, was restored from a 35mm duplicate negative held by the British Film Institute and released by Universal Pictures in 2016 in DCP format for theatrical distribution and Blu-ray for home video as part of &quot;The Marx Brothers Silver Screen Collection&quot;. The restored edition features an optional commentary track by film historian Jeffrey Vance.

==Reception==
Like its predecessor &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot;, &quot;Animal Crackers&quot; was a financial success. By June 1932, the film had earned $1.5 million in worldwide theatrical rentals.

==Multicolor clip==

In the 1990s, a 15-second clip filmed in Multicolor during the rehearsal of a scene in &quot;Animal Crackers&quot; was found and aired as a part of the Turner Classic Movies documentary &quot;Glorious Technicolor&quot; (1998). The clip is significant because it is the earliest known color footage of the Marx Brothers, and also for an appearance by Harpo without his usual costume and wig.

==References in popular culture==
* Captain Spaulding is mentioned in the song &quot;Lydia, the Tattooed Lady&quot; written by Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg. Groucho performs the song in the Marx Bros. film, &quot;At the Circus&quot; (1939); Virginia Weidler also sings it in &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (1940).
* &quot;Hello, I Must Be Going&quot; became a theme in Oliver Stone&#x27;s miniseries &quot;Wild Palms&quot;. It was the title of the final episode, and sung by villain Senator Kreutzer (Robert Loggia) as he died.
* British musician Phil Collins titled his 1982 album after the song &quot;Hello, I Must Be Going&quot;.
* The song &quot;Hello, I Must Be Going&quot; also accompanies the opening credits of Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Whatever Works&quot; (2009).
* &quot;Captain Spaulding&quot; is one of many Marx Brothers character-related pseudonyms for Sid Haig&#x27;s murderous clown character, John Cutter, in Rob Zombie&#x27;s &quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot; and its sequel &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rejects.&quot;
* The film is referenced in &quot;Murray Takes a Stand&quot;, a 1976 episode of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;.
* In the TV series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; , in which actor Alan Alda&#x27;s portrayal of Hawkeye Pierce is inspired by Groucho, early episodes featured a character named Captain Calvin Spalding, played by musician Loudon Wainwright III.
* &quot;Hooray For Captain Spaulding&quot; is performed in English and in French in a scene toward the end of Woody Allen&#x27;s 1996 movie musical &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot; at a party scene in Paris where all the guests are dressed as Groucho Marx.
* The Groucho-hosted quiz show &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; used an instrumental version of &quot;Hooray For Captain Spaulding&quot; as the theme for most of its run.

<text>The Hunting of the Snark, subtitled &quot;An Agony, in Eight fits&quot;, is a poem by the English writer Lewis Carroll. It is typically categorised as a nonsense poem. Written between 1874 and 1876, it borrows the setting, some creatures, and eight portmanteau words from Carroll&#x27;s earlier poem &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; in his children&#x27;s novel &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; (1871).

Macmillan published &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot; in the United Kingdom at the end of March 1876, with nine illustrations by Henry Holiday. It had mixed reviews from reviewers, who found it strange. The first printing of the poem consisted of 10,000 copies. There were two reprints by the conclusion of the year; in total, the poem was reprinted 17 times between 1876 and 1908. The poem also has been adapted for musicals, movies, opera, plays, and music.

The narrative follows a crew of ten trying to hunt the Snark, a creature which may turn out to be a highly dangerous &quot;Boojum&quot;. The only crew member to find the Snark quietly vanishes, leading the narrator to explain that the Snark was a Boojum after all. 

Carroll dedicated the poem to young Gertrude Chataway, whom he met in the English seaside town Sandown on the Isle of Wight in 1875. Included with many copies of the first edition of the poem was Carroll&#x27;s religious tract, &quot;An Easter Greeting to Every Child Who Loves &quot;Alice&quot;&quot;.

Various meanings in the poem have been proposed, among them existential angst, an allegory for tuberculosis, and a mockery of the Tichborne case.

While Carroll denied knowing the meaning behind the poem, he agreed in an 1897 reply to a reader&#x27;s letter with an interpretation of the poem as an allegory for the search for happiness. Henry Holiday, the illustrator of the poem, considered the poem a &quot;tragedy&quot;.

&quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot; shares its fictional setting with Lewis Carroll&#x27;s earlier poem &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; published in his 1871 children&#x27;s novel &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;. Eight nonsense words from &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; appear in &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot;: &quot;bandersnatch, beamish, frumious, galumphing, jubjub, mimsiest&quot; (which previously appeared as &quot;mimsy&quot; in &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;), &quot;outgrabe&quot;, and &quot;uffish&quot;. In a letter to the mother of his young friend Gertrude Chataway, Carroll described the domain of the Snark as &quot;an island frequented by the jubjub and the bandersnatchno doubt the very island where the jabberwock was slain.&quot;

=== Characters ===

The crew consists of ten members, where all but one description of the members begin with the letter B: a Bellman, the leader; a Boots (the only member of the crew without an illustration); a maker of Bonnets and Hoods (the only description which does not begin with the letter B); a Barrister, who settles arguments among the crew; a Broker, who can appraise the goods of the crew; a Billiard-marker, who is greatly skilled; a Banker, who possesses all of the crew&#x27;s money; a Beaver, who makes lace and has saved the crew from disaster several times; a Baker, who can only bake wedding cake, forgets his belongings and his name, but possesses courage; and a Butcher, who can only kill beavers.

=== Summary ===

After crossing the sea guided by the Bellman&#x27;s map of the Ocean (a blank sheet of paper) the hunting party arrives in a strange land, and the Bellman tells them the five signs by which a snark can be identified. The Bellman warns them that some snarks are highly dangerous boojums; on hearing this, the Baker faints. Once revived, the Baker recalls that his uncle warned him that if the Snark turns out to be a boojum, the hunter will &quot;softly and suddenly vanish away, and never be met with again&quot;. The Baker confesses that this possibility terrifies him.

The hunt begins:
&lt;poem&gt;
They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
They pursued it with forks and hope;
They threatened its life with a railway-share;
They charmed it with smiles and soap.
&lt;/poem&gt;
Along the way, the Butcher and Beaver, previously mutually wary, become fast friends after they hear the cry of a jubjub bird and the Butcher ends up giving the Beaver a lesson on maths and zoology. The Barrister, meanwhile, sleeps, and dreams of witnessing a court trial of a pig accused of deserting its sty, with a snark as its defence lawyer.

During the hunt, the Banker is attacked by a bandersnatch, and loses his sanity after trying to bribe the creature.

The Baker rushes ahead of the party and calls out that he has found a snark, but when the others arrive, he has mysteriously disappeared.
&lt;poem&gt;
They hunted till darkness came on, but they found
Not a button, or feather, or mark,
By which they could tell that they stood on the ground
Where the Baker had met with the Snark.

In the midst of the word he was trying to say,
In the midst of his laughter and glee,
He had softly and suddenly vanished away—
For the Snark was a Boojum, you see.
&lt;/poem&gt;

== Development ==
Two explanations of which event in Carroll&#x27;s life gave rise to &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot; have been offered. Biographer Morton N. Cohen connects the creation of &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot; with the illness of Carroll&#x27;s cousin and godson, the twenty-two-year-old Charlie Wilcox. On 17 July 1874, Carroll travelled to Guildford, Surrey, to care for him for six weeks, while the young man struggled with tuberculosis. The next day, while taking a walk in the morning after only a few hours of sleep, Carroll thought of the poem&#x27;s final line: &quot;For the Snark &quot;was&quot; a Boojum, you see.&quot;

Fuller Torrey and Judy Miller suggest that the event that inspired the poem was the sudden death of Carroll&#x27;s beloved uncle, Robert Wilfred Skeffington Lutwidge, caused by a patient in 1873 during Lutwidge&#x27;s time as an inspector of lunatic asylums. They support their analysis with parts of the poem, such as the Baker&#x27;s uncle&#x27;s advice to seek the snark with &quot;thimbles, forks, and soap&quot;, which, according to Torrey and Miller, were all items the lunatic asylum inspectors checked during their visits.

Holiday and Carroll had some disagreements on the artwork. Carroll initially objected to Holiday&#x27;s personification of hope and care, but agreed to the change, when Holiday explained that he had only intended to add another layer of meaning to the word &quot;with&quot;. However, Carroll refused his illustration of the boojum, preferring that the creature go without a depiction, and made him change his initial portrayal of the Broker, as it could have been perceived as antisemitic.

When finally published, the poem comprised 141 stanzas of four lines each, with internal rhymes in the first and third lines of irregular stanzas appearing in the poem from the second fit onwards. Martin Gardner annotated to &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot; that Elizabeth Sewell pointed out in &quot;The Field of Nonsense&quot; (1973) that a line in Carroll&#x27;s poem has a similarity to a line in a limerick (&quot;There was an old man of Port Grigor...&quot;) by Edward Lear.

=== Illustrations ===
To illustrate the poem Carroll chose Henry Holiday, whom he had met in 1869 or 1870. At the time Carroll approached him to ask if he could create three illustrations for the poem, Carroll had completed three &quot;fits&quot;, as he called the parts of his poem&quot;fit&quot; can mean either canto or convulsion&quot;The Landing&quot;, &quot;The Hunting&quot;, and &quot;The Vanishing&quot;. He intended to title it &quot;The Boojum&quot; and include it in his fantasy novel &quot;Sylvie and Bruno&quot;, which was unfinished at the time. However, in late October 1875, Carroll thought about having it published during Christmas; this proved impossible, as the wood engraving for the illustrations needed three months to be complete. By the time Holiday had completed the sketches and sent them to Carroll, Carroll had already created a new fit requiring an illustration. They worked this way until Holiday had created nine illustrations as well as the front cover and the back cover of the book. Thus, among the ten illustrations shown below, one illustration is not by Holiday. The &quot;Ocean Chart&quot; is typographic art whereas electrotypes made from Joseph Swain&#x27;s woodblock engravings were used to print Holiday&#x27;s illustrations.

There is no depiction of the Snark, nor of Boots. However, based on a draft by Carroll, the snark was allowed to show up in an illustration by Holiday, where it appeared in a dream of the Barrister.

The illustration to the chapter &quot;The Banker&#x27;s Fate&quot; might contain pictorial references to the etching &quot;The Image Breakers&quot; by Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder, to William Sidney Mount&#x27;s painting &quot;The Bone Player&quot; and to a photograph by Benjamin Duchenne used for a drawing in Charles Darwin&#x27;s 1872 book &quot;The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals&quot;.

=== Publication history ===

Upon the printing of the book on 29 March 1876, Carroll gave away eighty signed copies to his favourite young friends; in a typical fashion, he signed them with short poems, many of them acrostics of the child&#x27;s name. He dedicated &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot; to Gertrude Chataway, whom he had befriended in summer 1875 at the English seaside town Sandown on the Isle of Wight. He finished the dedication a month after befriending her, a double acrostic poem that not only spelled out her name, but contained a syllable of her name in the first line of each stanza. The stanza of his first draft concluded &quot;Rest on a friendly knee, the tale to ask / That he delights to tell.&quot; The poem was printed in &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot; with permission from Chataway&#x27;s mother.

Included with many copies of the first edition of &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot; was Carroll&#x27;s three-page, religious tract to his young readers, &quot;An Easter Greeting to Every Child Who Loves &quot;Alice&quot;&quot;. Largely written on 5 February 1876, &quot;An Easter Greeting&quot; explores the concept of innocence and eternal life through biblical allusions and literary allusions to Romantic writers William Blake and William Wordsworth. Gardner suggests that Carroll included the tract as a way of balancing the dark tone of the poem. Scholar Selwyn Goodacre speculates that, as many copies of first-edition of the poem contain the tract, there is a possibility that all first editions originally had a copy of &quot;An Easter Greeting&quot;.

== Reception and legacy ==
The first printing of &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot; consisted of 10,000 copies. By the conclusion of 1876, it had seen two reprints, with a total of 18,000 or 19,000 copies circulating. In total, the poem was reprinted seventeen times between 1876 and 1908.

&quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot; received largely mixed reviews from Carroll&#x27;s contemporary reviewers. &quot;The Academy&quot;″s Andrew Lang criticised Carroll&#x27;s decision to use poetry instead of prose and its too appealing title. &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; described it as &quot;the most bewildering of modern poetry&quot;, wondering &quot;if he has merely been inspired to reduce to idiotcy as many readers and more especially reviewers, as possible&quot;. According to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, Carroll&#x27;s work had progressively worsened after &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (1865), with &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot; being the worst of his works and &quot;not worthy [of] the name of nonsense&quot;. While &quot;The Spectator&quot; wrote that the poem&#x27;s final line had the potential to become a proverb, it criticised the poem as &quot;a failure&quot; that might have succeeded with more work from the author. &quot;The Saturday Review&quot; wrote that the poem offered &quot;endless speculation&quot; as to the true identity of the Snark, although the unnamed reviewer felt that the familiar nature of Carroll&#x27;s nonsense weakened its effect for the reader. Conversely, &quot;The Graphic&quot; praised the poem as a welcome departure from the &quot;Alice&quot; books, and called it &quot;a glorious piece of nonsense&quot;, that could appeal to all &quot;Alice&quot; fans.

&quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot; has in common some elements with Carroll&#x27;s other works. It shares its author&#x27;s love of puns on the word &quot;fit&quot; with &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, and mentions of &quot;candle-ends&quot; and &quot;toasted cheese&quot; with his supernatural poem &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot;. Additionally all three works include the number &quot;42&quot;. Another of Carroll&#x27;s children&#x27;s novels, &quot;Sylvie and Bruno Concluded&quot; (1893) makes a reference to the Boojum.

Other illustrators of &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot; include Peter Newell (1903), Edward A. Wilson (1932), Mervyn Peake (1941), Aldren Watson (1952), Tove Jansson (1959), Helen Oxenbury (1970), Byron Sewell (1974), John Minnion (1974), Harold Jones (1975), Ralph Steadman (1975), Quentin Blake (1976), Frank Hinder (1989) and Brian Puttock (1997).

=== Cultural impact ===

&quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot; has seen various adaptations into musicals, opera, theatre, plays, and music, including a piece for trombone by Norwegian composer Arne Nordheim (1975) a jazz rendition (2009), and (in French translation&quot;La chasse au Snark&quot;) with music by Michel Puig for five actresses, eight actors and an instrumental ensemble of five players, premiered at the Festival d&#x27;Avignon in 1971. The poem was turned into a £2 million budget West End musical &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot; by Mike Batt. In 2023 a film was released by Simon Davison.

The poem has inspired literature, such as Jack London&#x27;s &quot;The Cruise of the Snark&quot; (1911), the science-fiction short story &quot;Chaos, Coordinated&quot; (1947) by John MacDougal, Elspeth Huxley&#x27;s &quot;With Forks and Hope&quot; (1964) and the title of Kate Wilhelm&#x27;s novella &quot;With Thimbles, with Forks and Hope.&quot; American author Edith Wharton (1862–1937) was fond of the poem as a child.

Additionally, it has also been alluded to in

* fiction, such as &quot;Perelandra&quot; (1943) by C. S. Lewis; and &quot;Stand on Zanzibar&quot; by John Brunner; in the sci-fi novel &quot;Startide Rising&quot; (1983) and its sequels the spaceship &quot;Streaker&quot; is described as a Snarkhunter-class exploration vessel. In the Ocean of Night Benford it is rather prominent. In the 1966 short story &quot;Jonah&quot; (&quot;Jonas&quot; in French) by Gérard Klein, &quot;snark&quot; is a term used for bioships that go berserk.
* television, such as &quot;The Soul of Genius&quot; episode of the British TV crime drama &quot;Lewis&quot;
* court rulings, such as in Parhat v. Gates (2008)

* a phenomenon in superfluidity
* graph theory
* hydrology, with a group of French hydrologists publishing in a well-known scientific journal a prose analogue to Carroll&#x27;s poem, mocking the rivalries existing in the academic community

* geography, a Snark Island and Boojum Rock exist in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal
* botany, the Boojum tree in Baja California, Mexico 
* Japanese animation, such as &quot;Ghost Hound&quot; (2007–08)
* video games, such as &quot;Half-Life&quot; (1998) and &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot; (2000)
* A song, &quot;Nine Funerals of the Citizen King&quot;, by Henry Cow.

== Analysis ==
Various themes have been suggested by scholars. According to biographer Florence Becker Lennon, the poem&#x27;s &quot;motif of loss of name or identity&quot; is typical of Carroll&#x27;s work. Richard Kelly writes that the poem contains a &quot;theme of annihilation&quot;. Furthermore, Edward Guiliano feels that the &quot;Snark&quot; is within the nonsense tradition of Thomas Hood and, especially, W. S. Gilbert, the librettist of the famous Gilbert and Sullivan team. According to him, a case can be made for a direct influence of Gilbert&#x27;s Bab Ballads on &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot;, based on the fact that Carroll was well-acquainted with the comic writing and the theatre of his age.

Widely varying interpretations of &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot; have been suggested: an allegory for tuberculosis, a mockery of the Tichborne case, a satire of the controversies between religion and science, the repression of Carroll&#x27;s sexuality, and a piece against vivisection, among others. According to Cohen, the poem represents a &quot;voyage of life&quot;, with the Baker&#x27;s disappearance caused by his violation of the laws of nature, by hoping to unravel its mysteries. Lennon sees &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot; as &quot;a tragedy of frustration and bafflement&quot;, comparable to British actor Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s early comedies.

According to Kelly, &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot; is &quot;Carroll&#x27;s comic rendition of his fears of disorder and chaos, with the comedy serving as a psychological defense against the devastating idea of personal annihilation.&quot; Kelly writes that the Bellman&#x27;s Rule of Three (&quot;What I tell you three times is true&quot;) and starting each character&#x27;s name with the letter B are &quot;notable attempts to create a sense of order and meaning out of chaos&quot;.

F.C.S. Schiller, writing under the pseudonym &quot;Snarkophilus Snobbs&quot;, interprets the poem as an allegory of Man&#x27;s attempt to understand &quot;the Absolute&quot;, and the members of the crew as representing different cultural approaches to the problem. His interpretation of the Sixth Fit, &quot;The Barrister&#x27;s Dream&quot; is particularly notable: He reads the trial of the pig for deserting its sty as symbolizing the ethical debate about whether suicide should be condemned as an immoral or culpable action. The pig who deserts its sty represents the suicidal person who abandons life. (Like the pig, he&#x27;s guilty – but being dead, is not punishable.)

Martin Gardner sees the poem as dealing with existential angst, and states that the Baker may be Carroll&#x27;s satire of himself, pointing to the fact that the Baker was named after a beloved uncle, as was Carroll, and that the two were around the same age at the time of the writing of the poem. Alternatively, Larry Shaw of the fan magazine &quot;Inside and Science Fiction Advertiser&quot; suggests that the Boots, being the Snark, actually murdered the Baker.

Darien Graham-Smith suggests that &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot; stands for science (e.g. Charles Darwin&#x27;s research), where the Boojum stands for religiously unsettling results of scientific research (e.g. Charles Darwin&#x27;s findings).

Also references to religious issues had been suggested, like the Baker&#x27;s 42 boxes being a reference to Thomas Cranmer&#x27;s &quot;Forty-Two Articles&quot; with a focus on the last article on eternal damnation, and Holiday&#x27;s illustration to the last chapter containing a pictorial allusion to Cranmer&#x27;s burning.

<text>David Zindell (born November 28, 1952) is an American science fiction and fantasy epics writer.

== Writing career ==
Zindell&#x27;s first published story was &quot;The Dreamer&#x27;s Sleep&quot; in &quot;Fantasy Book&quot; in 1984. His novelette &quot;Shanidar&quot;, which shared a background with his first novel &quot;Neverness&quot;, won the Writers of the Future contest in 1985. He followed &quot;Neverness&quot; with a sequel trilogy called &quot;A Requiem for Homo Sapiens&quot;.

Zindell&#x27;s fantasy series &quot;The Ea Cycle&quot; has as a theme the evolution of consciousness, through the method of fantasy. The plot concerns a prince named Valashu Elahad searching for a relic called the Lightstone to stop the immortal Morjin, Lord of Lies, who seeks to create a world filled with madness.

In 2015 he published &quot;Splendor&quot;, a nonfiction book, and in 2017 he published &quot;The Idiot Gods&quot;, a novel told from the point of view of intelligent killer whales.

== Style and themes ==
John Clute wrote that Zindell was a &quot;romantic, ambitious, and skilled&quot; writer. Zindell has described his style as an attempt to communicate the connectedness of things, the connection between mysticism and evolution, and the possibilities of life, and his fiction as an attempt to heal false dichotomies such as materialism and spirituality.

== Personal life ==
Zindell was born in Toledo, Ohio, and resides today in Boulder, Colorado, where he works as a test coach; he received a BA in mathematics and minored in anthropology at the University of Colorado at Boulder.

<text>Jonathan Livingston Seagull is an allegorical fable in novella form written by American author Richard Bach and illustrated with black-and-white photographs shot by Russell Munson. It is about a seagull who is trying to learn about flying, personal reflection, freedom, and self-realization. It was first published in book form in 1970 with little advertising or expectations; by the end of 1972, over a million copies were in print, the book having reached the number-one spot on bestseller lists mostly through word of mouth recommendations.

In 2014, the book was reissued as Jonathan Livingston Seagull: The Complete Edition, which added a 17-page fourth part to the story.

== Plot ==

=== Part One ===
Jonathan Livingston Seagull is an independent thinker frustrated with the daily squabbles over meager food and sheer survival within his flock of seagulls who have no deeper sense of purpose. Unlike his peers, he is seized with a passion for flight of all kinds, and his soul soars as he aerially experiments and learns more about the nature of his own body and the environment in achieving faster and faster flights. Eventually, his lack of conformity within the Flock causes them to officially banish him with the label &quot;Outcast&quot;. Undeterred, Jonathan continues his efforts to reach ever-greater flight goals, finding that he is often successful. He lives a long happy life and is sad not due to his loneliness but only due to the fact that the rest of the Flock will never know the full glories of flying, like him. In his old age, he is met by two radiantly-bright seagulls who share his abilities, explaining to him that he has learned much, but that they have come to take him &quot;home&quot; where he will go &quot;higher&quot;.

=== Part Two ===
Jonathan transcends into a reality, which he assumes is heaven, where all the gulls enjoy practicing incredible maneuvers and speeds, like him. His instructor, Sullivan, explains that a few gulls progress to this higher existence, but most others live through the same world over and over again. The Elder Gull of the community, Chiang, admits that this reality is not heaven, but that heaven is the achieving of perfection itself: an ability beyond any particular time or place. Suddenly, Chiang disappears, then reappears a moment later, displaying his attainment of perfect speed. When Jonathan begs to learn Chiang&#x27;s skills, Chiang explains that the secret to true flight is to recognize that one&#x27;s nature exists across all time and space. Jon begins successfully following Chiang&#x27;s teachings. One day, Chiang slowly transforms into a blindingly luminous being and, just before disappearing for the last time, he gives Jonathan one last tip: &quot;keep working on love.&quot; Jonathan ponders Chiang&#x27;s words and, in a discussion with Sullivan, decides to go back to his own home planet, to teach his original Flock all that he has learned. Returning there, he finds a fellow lover of flying, Fletcher Lynd Seagull, who is angry at recently being &quot;Outcast&quot; by the Flock. Jonathan takes on Fletcher as his first pupil.

=== Part Three ===
Jonathan has now amassed a small group of Outcasts as flying students, with Fletcher the star pupil, and tells them that &quot;each of us is in truth... an unlimited idea of freedom&quot;. The deeper nature of his words is not yet understood by his pupils, who believe they are just getting basic flying lessons. For a month, Jonathan boldly takes them to perform aerial stunts in front of the bewildered Flock. Some of the Flock slowly join the Outcasts, while others label him a messiah or a devil; Jonathan feels misunderstood. One day, Fletcher dies in a flying collision. Awaking in another reality, he hears Jonathan&#x27;s voice teasing him that the trick to transcending the limitations of time and space is to take it step by step — not so quickly. Fletcher is resurrected in the very midst of the flabbergasted Flock, some of whom fear and decry his supernatural reappearance, but Jonathan insists that he must learn to love the ignorant Flock. Jonathan&#x27;s body suddenly begins to fade away, he requests that Fletcher stop others from thinking of him as anything silly like a god, and he gives a final piece of advice: &quot;find out what you already know&quot;. Soon, Fletcher faces a group of eager new students of his own. He passes on Jonathan&#x27;s sentiments that seagulls are limitless ideas of freedom and their bodies nothing more than thought itself, but this only baffles the young gulls. He realizes now why Jonathan taught him to take lessons slowly, step by step. Privately musing on Jonathan&#x27;s idea that there are no limits, Fletcher smiles at the implication of this: that he will see Jonathan again, one day soon.

== Part Four in 2014&#x27;s re-print, &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull: The Complete Edition&quot; ==
In 2013, Richard Bach took up a non-published fourth part of the book, which he had written contemporaneously with the original. He edited and polished it and then sent the result to a publisher. Bach reported that he was inspired to finish the fourth part of the novella by a near-death experience which had occurred in relation to a nearly fatal plane crash in August 2012. In February 2014, the 138-page Bach work &quot;Illusions II: The Adventures of a Reluctant Student&quot; was published as a booklet by Kindle Direct Publishing. &quot;Illusions II&quot; also contains allusions to and insights regarding the same near-death experience. In October 2014, &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull: The Complete Edition,&quot; was published, and this edition includes Part Four of the story.

Part Four focuses on the period several hundred years after Jonathan and his students have left the Flock, and their teachings become venerated rather than practised. The birds spend all their time extolling the virtues of Jonathan and his students and spend no time flying for flying&#x27;s sake. The seagulls practice strange rituals and use demonstrations of their respect for Jonathan and his students as status symbols. Eventually, some birds reject the ceremony and rituals and just start flying. A bird, named Anthony Gull, questions the value of living since &quot;life is pointless and since pointless is by definition meaningless then the only proper act is to dive into the ocean and drown. Better not to exist at all than to exist like a seaweed, without meaning or joy [...] He had to die sooner or later anyway, and he saw no reason to prolong the painful boredom of living.&quot; As Anthony makes a dive-bomb to the sea, at a speed and from an altitude which would kill him, a white blur flashes alongside him. Anthony catches up to the blur, which turns out to be a seagull, and asks what the bird was doing.

== Development ==
Bach initially wrote it as a series of short stories that were published in &quot;Flying&quot; magazine in the late 1960s.

Bach, who said the book came to him as &quot;a visionesque spooky thing&quot;, stopped after he wrote 10 pages and didn&#x27;t pick it up again for a few years.

The book was rejected by several publishers before coming to the attention of Eleanor Friede at Macmillan in 1969. &quot;I think it has a chance of growing into a long-lasting standard book for readers of all ages&quot;, she wrote in her acquisition memo. She convinced Macmillan to buy it and Bach received a $2,000 advance ().

Jonathan Livingston Seagull is named after John H. Livingston, a Waco Aircraft Company test pilot. Livingston died of a heart attack in 1974, at the age of 76, just after he had test-flown an acrobatic home-built Pitts Special.

In the book &quot;The Nature of Personal Reality&quot; by Jane Roberts/Seth, page 55 of the paperback edition, Richard Bach was visiting Jane Roberts and stated that in 1959 he was walking beside a canal and heard a voice say &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&quot;. This puts into question the idea that the book was named after a particular person.

== Reception ==
The book was a sleeper hit; the first edition in 1970 was only 3,000 copies and it would take two years before reaching number one on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller List. &quot;Not a single magazine or newspaper — including &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; — so much as mentioned&quot; the book when it first came out, &quot;The Times&quot; reported in 1972. Macmillan failed to secure any advance publicity for Bach, but he personally took out two very small ads in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; and &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;. The first printing sold out by the end of 1970, and in 1971 an additional 140,000 copies were printed. Mostly a word of mouth phenomenon, it entered the &quot;NYT&quot; Bestseller List on April 20, 1972, where it remained for 37 weeks, and by July 1972 it had 440,000 copies in print. &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; published a condensed version. In 1972 and 1973, the book topped the &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; list of bestselling novels in the United States.

Book sellers didn&#x27;t know how to classify it. &quot;Some put it under nature, some under religion, some under photography, some under children’s books.&quot; Friede&#x27;s advice was, &quot;put it next to the cash register.&quot;

Several early commentators, emphasizing the first part of the book, see it as part of the US self-help and positive thinking culture, epitomized by Norman Vincent Peale and by the New Thought movement. Film critic Roger Ebert wrote that the book was &quot;so banal that it had to be sold to adults; kids would have seen through it.&quot;

The book is listed as one of fifty &quot;timeless spiritual classics&quot; in a book by Tom Butler-Bowdon, who noted that &quot;it is easy now, thirty-five years on, to overlook the originality of the book&#x27;s concept, and though some find it rather naïve, in fact it expresses timeless ideas about human potential.&quot;

John Clute, for &quot;The Encyclopedia of Fantasy&quot; (1997), wrote: &quot;an animal fantasy about a philosophical gull who is profoundly affected by flying, but who demands too much of his community and is cast out by it. He becomes an extremely well-behaved accursed wanderer, then dies, and in posthumous &quot;fantasy&quot; sequences--though he is too wise really to question the fact of death, and too calmly confident to have doubts about his continuing upward mobility--he learns greater wisdom. Back on Earth, he continues to preach and heal and finally returns to heaven, where he belongs.&quot;

== In popular culture ==
=== Parodies ===
* A 1972 parody, &quot;Marvin Stanley Pigeon&quot;, was published by Thomas Meehan in &quot;The New Yorker:&quot; &quot;Marvin Stanley Pigeon was no ordinary pigeon. While other pigeons spent their time grubbing for food, Marvin Stanley Pigeon worked away on his book on the window ledge outside the Manuscript Room of the Public Library in Bryant Park. He wanted to get his novel done in time for Macmillan&#x27;s spring list.&quot;

=== Music ===
* The novel was one of the inspirations for the band name of A Flock of Seagulls.

== Adaptations ==
The novella inspired the production of a film of the same title in 1973. The film was made by Hall Bartlett many years before computer-generated effects were available. In order to make seagulls act on cue and perform aerobatics, Mark Smith of Escondido, California built radio-controlled gliders that looked like real seagulls from a few feet away. This footage was not used in the final cut of the film.

Bach had written the film&#x27;s original screenplay, but he sued Paramount Pictures before the film&#x27;s release because he felt that there were too many discrepancies between the film and the book. Director Bartlett had allegedly violated a term in his contract with Bach which stated that no changes could be made to the film&#x27;s adaptation without Bach&#x27;s consent. Bach took offense to scenes Bartlett had filmed which were not present in the book, most notably the sequence in which Jonathan is suddenly attacked by a wild hawk, which was voiced by Bartlett himself. Ultimately, the court ruled that Bach&#x27;s name would be taken off the screenplay credits, and that the film would be released with a card indicating that Bach disapproved of the final cut. Bach&#x27;s attorney claimed, &quot;It took tremendous courage to say this motion picture had to come out of theaters unless it was changed. Paramount was stunned.&quot;

The Grammy Award-winning soundtrack album was composed and performed by Neil Diamond and produced by Tom Catalano. It won the 1974 Grammy Award as Best Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or a Television Special. The album apparently also made more money than the film, selling two million copies in the United States, 400,000 in France, 250,000 in Germany, 200,000 in Canada and 100,000 in the United Kingdom.

The Irish actor Richard Harris won a Grammy in 1973 for the Audiobook LP &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull.&quot; To date, Harris&#x27;s reading has not been released on any other format. Versions read by the author, Richard Bach, have been released on LP, cassette, and CD.

<doc id="45233" wikidata="Q181875" url="?curid=45233" title="Robert Peel">
<text>Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet (5 February 1788 – 2 July 1850), was a British Conservative statesman who twice was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1834–1835, 1841–1846), and simultaneously was Chancellor of the Exchequer (1834–1835). He previously was Home Secretary twice (1822–1827, 1828–1830). He is regarded as the father of modern British policing, owing to his founding of the Metropolitan Police while he was Home Secretary. Peel was one of the founders of the modern Conservative Party.

The son of a wealthy textile manufacturer and politician, Peel was the first prime minister from an industrial business background. He earned a double first in classics and mathematics from Christ Church, Oxford. He entered the House of Commons in 1809 and became a rising star in the Tory Party. Peel entered the Cabinet as home secretary (1822–1827), where he reformed and liberalised the criminal law and created the modern police force, leading to a new type of officer known in tribute to him as &quot;&quot; and &quot;peelers&quot;. After a brief period out of office he returned as home secretary under his political mentor the Duke of Wellington (1828–1830), also serving as Leader of the House of Commons. Initially, a supporter of continued legal discrimination against Catholics, Peel reversed himself and supported the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 and the 1828 repeal of the Test Act, claiming that &quot;though emancipation was a great danger, civil strife was a greater danger&quot;.

After being in opposition from 1830 to 1834, he became prime minister in November 1834. Peel issued the Tamworth Manifesto (December 1834), laying down the principles upon which the modern British Conservative Party is based. His first ministry was a minority government, dependent on Whig support and with Peel serving as his own chancellor of the Exchequer. After only four months, his government collapsed and he was Leader of the Opposition during Melbourne&#x27;s second government (1835–1841). Peel became prime minister again after the 1841 general election. His second government ruled for five years. He cut tariffs to stimulate trade, replacing the lost revenue with a 3% income tax. He played a central role in making free trade a reality and set up a modern banking system. His government&#x27;s major legislation included the Mines and Collieries Act 1842, the Income Tax Act 1842, the Factories Act 1844 and the Railway Regulation Act 1844. Peel&#x27;s government was weakened by anti-Catholic sentiment following the controversial increase in the Maynooth Grant of 1845. After the outbreak of the Great Irish Famine, his decision to join with Whigs and Radicals to repeal the Corn Laws led to his resignation as prime minister in 1846. Peel remained an influential MP and leader of the Peelite faction until his death in 1850.

Peel often started from a traditional Tory position in opposition to a measure, then reversed his stance and became the leader in supporting liberal legislation. This happened with the Test Act, Catholic emancipation, the Reform Act, income tax and, most notably, the repeal of the Corn Laws. Historian A. J. P. Taylor wrote: &quot;Peel was in the first rank of 19th-century statesmen. He carried Catholic Emancipation; he repealed the Corn Laws; he created the modern Conservative Party on the ruins of the old Toryism.&quot;

==Early life==
Peel was born at Chamber Hall, Bury, Lancashire, to the industrialist and parliamentarian Sir Robert Peel, 1st Baronet, and his wife Ellen Yates. His father was one of the richest textile manufacturers of the early Industrial Revolution. The family moved from Lancashire to Drayton Manor near Tamworth, Staffordshire; the manor house has since been demolished, and the site occupied by Drayton Manor Theme Park.

Peel received his early education from a clergyman tutor in Bury and at a clergyman&#x27;s local school in Tamworth. He may also have attended Bury Grammar School or Hipperholme Grammar School, though evidence for either is anecdotal rather than textual. He started at Harrow School in February 1800.

At Harrow, he was a contemporary of Lord Byron, who recalled of Peel that &quot;we were on good terms&quot; and that &quot;I was always in scrapes, and he never&quot;. On Harrow&#x27;s Speech Day in 1804, Peel and Byron acted part of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Peel playing Turnus and Byron playing Latinus.

In 1805, Peel matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford. His tutor was Charles Lloyd, later Regius Professor of Divinity, on Peel&#x27;s recommendation appointed bishop of Oxford. In 1808 Peel became the first Oxford student to take a double first in Classics and Mathematics.

Peel was a law student at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1809. He also held military commissions as a captain in the Manchester Regiment of Militia in 1808, and later as lieutenant in the Staffordshire Yeomanry Cavalry in 1820.

==Early political career: 1809–1822==

=== Member of Parliament ===
Peel entered politics in 1809 at the age of 21, as MP for the Irish rotten borough of Cashel, County Tipperary. With a scant 24 electors on the rolls, he was elected unopposed. His sponsor for the election (besides his father) was the chief secretary for Ireland, Sir Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington, with whom Peel&#x27;s political career would be entwined for the next 25 years. Peel made his maiden speech at the start of the 1810 session, when he was chosen by prime minister Spencer Perceval to second the reply to the king&#x27;s speech. His speech was a sensation, famously described by the Speaker, Charles Abbot, as &quot;the best first speech since that of William Pitt&quot;.

Peel changed constituency twice, becoming one of the two Members for Chippenham in 1812, and then one of those for Oxford University in 1817.

=== Junior minister ===
In 1810, Peel was appointed an Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies; his secretary of state was Lord Liverpool. When Lord Liverpool formed a government in 1812, Peel was appointed chief secretary for Ireland. The Peace Preservation Act 1814 authorised the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland to appoint additional magistrates in a county in a state of disturbance, who were authorised to appoint paid special constables (later called &quot;peelers&quot;). Peel thus laid the basis for the Royal Irish Constabulary.

Peel was firmly opposed to Catholic emancipation, believing that Catholics could not be admitted to Parliament as they refused to swear the Oath of Allegiance to the Crown. In May 1817, Peel delivered the closing speech in opposition to Henry Grattan&#x27;s Catholic emancipation bill; the bill was defeated by 245 votes to 221. Peel resigned as chief secretary and left Ireland in August 1818.

In 1819, the House of Commons appointed a Select Committee, the Bullion Committee, charged with stabilising British finances after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, and Peel was chosen as its chairman. Peel&#x27;s Bill planned to return British currency to the gold standard, reversing the Bank Restriction Act 1797, within four years (it was actually accomplished by 1821).

==Home Secretary: 1822–1830==
=== Senior minister ===

Peel was considered one of the rising stars of the Tory party, first entering the cabinet in 1822 as home secretary. As home secretary, he introduced a large number of important reforms to British criminal law.

=== Reforms and policies ===
In one of his policies, he reduced the number of crimes punishable by death, and simplified the law by repealing a large number of criminal statutes and consolidating their provisions into what are known as Peel&#x27;s Acts. He reformed the gaol system, introducing payment for gaolers and education for the inmates in the Gaols Act 1823 (4 Geo. 4. c. 64).

In 1827 the prime minister Lord Liverpool became incapacitated and was replaced by George Canning. Peel resigned as home secretary. Canning favoured Catholic emancipation, while Peel had been one of its most outspoken opponents (earning the nickname &quot;Orange Peel&quot;, with Orange the colour of the Protestant Orange Order). George Canning himself died less than four months later and, after the brief premiership of Lord Goderich, Peel returned to the post of home secretary under the premiership of his long-time ally the Duke of Wellington. During this time he was widely perceived as the number-two in the Tory Party, after Wellington himself.

The Test and Corporation Acts required many officials to be communicants in the Anglican Church and penalised both nonconformists and Catholics. They were no longer enforced but were a matter of humiliation. Peel at first opposed the repeal, but reversed himself and led the repeal on behalf of the government, after consultation with Anglican Church leaders. The Sacramental Test Act 1828 passed into law in May 1828. In future religious issues he made it a point to consult with church leaders from the major denominations.

The 1828 Clare by-election returned the Catholic Irish nationalist leader Daniel O&#x27;Connell. By autumn 1828, the Chief Secretary for Ireland was alarmed by the extent of civil disorder and the prospect of a rebellion if O&#x27;Connell were barred from Parliament. Wellington and Peel now conceded the necessity of Catholic emancipation, Peel writing to Wellington that &quot;though emancipation was a great danger, civil strife was a greater danger&quot;.

Peel drew up the Catholic Relief bill. He felt compelled to stand for re-election to his seat in Oxford, as he was representing the graduates of Oxford University (many of whom were Anglican clergymen), and had previously stood on a platform of opposition to Catholic Emancipation. Peel lost his seat in a by-election in February 1829 to Ultra-Tory Robert Inglis, but soon found another by moving to a rotten borough, Westbury, retaining his Cabinet position. He stood for Tamworth in the general election of 1830, representing Tamworth until his death.

Peel guided the Catholic Relief (Emancipation) bill through the House of Commons, Wellington through the House of Lords. With many Ultra-Tories vehemently opposed to emancipation, the bill could pass only with Whig support.

Wellington threatened to resign if King George IV did not give Royal assent; the King finally relented. The Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 passed into law in April 1829. Peel&#x27;s U-turn cost him the trust of many Tories: according to Norman Gash, Peel had been &quot;the idolized champion of the Protestant party; that party now regarded him as an outcast&quot;.
=== Founding the Metropolitan Police ===
It was in 1829 that Peel established the Metropolitan Police Force for London based at Scotland Yard. The 1,000 constables employed were affectionately nicknamed &#x27;bobbies&#x27; or, somewhat less affectionately, &#x27;peelers&#x27;. Although unpopular at first, they proved very successful in cutting crime in London, and, by 1857, all cities in Britain were obliged to form their own police forces. Known as the father of modern policing, Peel is thought to have contributed to the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s first set of &quot;Instructions to Police Officers&quot;, emphasising the importance of its civilian nature and policing by consent. However, what are now commonly known as the Peelian Principles were not written by him but were instead produced by Charles Reith in his 1948 book, &quot;A Short History of the British Police&quot;, as a nine-point summary of the 1829 &quot;Instructions&quot;.

==Opposition: 1830–1834==
The middle and working classes in England at that time, however, were clamouring for reform, and Catholic Emancipation was only one of the ideas in the air. The Tory ministry refused to bend on other issues and were swept out of office in 1830 in favour of the Whigs. The following few years were extremely turbulent, but eventually enough reforms were passed that King William IV felt confident enough to invite the Tories to form a ministry again in succession to those of Lord Grey and Lord Melbourne in December 1834. Peel was selected as prime minister but was in Italy at the time, so Wellington acted as a caretaker for three weeks until Peel&#x27;s return.

==Prime Minister: 1834–1835==

=== Appointment ===

Following the resignation of former prime minister Charles Grey, because of an issue regarding Ireland&#x27;s conciliatory reform and at the invitation of King William IV, Peel became prime minister in early December 1834. Peel formed his own government, though it was a Tory government that was a minority government and depended on Whig goodwill for its continued existence. Parliament was dissolved in late December 1834 and a general election was called. Voting took place in January and February 1835, and Peel&#x27;s supporters gained around 100 seats, but this was not enough to give them a majority.

=== Tamworth Manifesto ===
As his statement of policy at the general election of January 1835, Peel issued the Tamworth Manifesto. This document was the basis on which the modern Conservative Party was founded. In it, Peel pledged that the Conservatives would endorse reform such as reforms concerning economic and financial affairs, free trade and factory workers&#x27; rights.

The Whigs formed a compact with Daniel O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s Irish Radical members to repeatedly defeat the government on various bills. Eventually, after only about 100 days in government, Peel&#x27;s ministry resigned out of frustration and the Whigs under Lord Melbourne returned to power. The only real achievement of Peel&#x27;s first administration was a commission to review the governance of the Church of England. This ecclesiastical commission was the forerunner of the Church Commissioners.

=== Confidence vote and resignation ===
Despite the January 1835 general election, from which Peel attempted to consolidate his party&#x27;s majority in Parliament, the Conservatives still remained a minority. This made Peel&#x27;s position in the Commons precarious from the start.

The immediate cause of Peel&#x27;s downfall was a debate over the Church of Ireland. On 7 April 1835, Whig MP Ralph Bernal brought forward a report critical of Peel&#x27;s administration of the Church of Ireland&#x27;s revenues and proposed reforms. The report was passed in the House of Commons by a vote of 285 to 258, signifying a lack of confidence in Peel&#x27;s government. This defeat underscored the government&#x27;s inability to secure enough support to govern effectively.

This loss led to Peel&#x27;s resignation the following day, on 8 April 1835. The passing of the vote of no confidence highlighted the conditions in British politics at the time in a parliamentary system. After Peel&#x27;s resignation, King William IV invited Lord Melbourne to form a new government, allowing the Whigs to return to power.

==Leader of the Opposition: 1835–1841==

Peel&#x27;s party was bolstered by the adherence of a number of dissident Whigs associated with the Derby Dilly. These self-described &#x27;moderate Whigs&#x27; were led by former cabinet ministers Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby, and Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet.

In May 1839, Peel was offered another chance to form a government, this time by the new monarch, Queen Victoria. However, this too would have been a minority government, and Peel felt he needed a further sign of confidence from his Queen. Lord Melbourne had been Victoria&#x27;s confidant since her accession in 1837, and many of the higher posts in Victoria&#x27;s household were held by the wives and female relatives of Whigs; there was some feeling that Victoria had allowed herself to be too closely associated with the Whig party. Peel, therefore, asked that some of this entourage be dismissed and replaced with their Conservative counterparts, provoking the so-called Bedchamber Crisis. Victoria refused to change her household, and despite pleadings from the Duke of Wellington, relied on assurances of support from Whig leaders. Peel refused to form a government, and the Whigs returned to power.

==Prime Minister: 1841–1846==
===Economic reforms===
Peel finally had a chance to head a majority government following the election of July 1841. Peel came to office during an economic recession which had seen a slump in world trade and a budget deficit of £7.5 million run up by the Whigs. Confidence in banks and businesses was low, and a trade deficit existed.
To raise revenue Peel&#x27;s 1842 budget saw the re-introduction of the income tax, removed previously at the end of the Napoleonic Wars. The rate was 7d in the pound, or just under 3 per cent. The money raised was more than expected and allowed for the removal and reduction of over 1,200 tariffs on imports including the controversial sugar duties. It was also in the 1842 budget that the repeal of the corn laws was first proposed. It was defeated in a Commons vote by a margin of 4:1.

The economic historian Charles Read has analysed Peel&#x27;s economic policies as:(i) Fixing the value of British currency to a gold standard, with the paper pound currency freely convertible to gold.

(ii) A limited banknote supply based on a fixed relationship to the gold reserve.

=== Domestic policy ===

==== Health ====
A Board of Supervision was established, and two measures passed, under which county asylums were erected and prompt medical treatment was ensured. In addition, it was provided &quot;that a certificate of insanity, signed by two disinterested doctors, had to be presented before any person was confined to an asylum.&quot; According to one study, &quot;the whole treatment of lunacy was humanised and lifted out of the atmosphere of profits into that of curative effort and civic responsibility.&quot;

====Factory Act====
Peel&#x27;s promise of modest reform was held to, and the second most famous bill of this ministry, while &quot;reforming&quot; in 21st-century eyes, was in fact aimed at the reformers themselves, with their constituency among the new industrial rich. The Factory Act 1844 acted more against these industrialists than it did against the traditional stronghold of the Conservatives, the landed gentry, by restricting the number of hours that children and women could work in a factory and setting rudimentary safety standards for machinery. This was a continuation of his own father&#x27;s work as an MP, as the elder Robert Peel was most noted for the reform of working conditions during the first part of the 19th century. Helping him was Lord Shaftesbury, a British MP who also established the coal mines act.

====Assassination attempt====
In 1843 Peel was the target of a failed assassination attempt; a criminally insane Scottish woodturner named Daniel M&#x27;Naghten stalked him for several days before, on 20 January, killing Peel&#x27;s personal secretary Edward Drummond thinking he was Peel, which led to the formation of the controversial criminal defence of insanity.

==== Corn Laws ====
The most notable act of Peel&#x27;s second ministry, however, was the one that would bring it down. Peel moved against the landholders by repealing the Corn Laws, which supported agricultural revenues by restricting grain imports. This radical break with Conservative protectionism was triggered by the Great Irish Famine (1845–1849). Tory agriculturalists were sceptical of the extent of the problem, and Peel reacted slowly to the famine, famously stating in October 1846 (already in opposition): &quot;There is such a tendency to exaggeration and inaccuracy in Irish reports that delay in acting on them is always desirable&quot;.

His own party failed to support the bill, but it passed with Whig and Radical support. On the third reading of Peel&#x27;s Bill of Repeal (Importation Act 1846) on 15 May, MPs voted 327 votes to 229 (a majority of 98) to repeal the Corn Laws. On 25 June the Duke of Wellington persuaded the House of Lords to pass it. On that same night Peel&#x27;s Irish Coercion Bill was defeated in the Commons by 292 to 219 by &quot;a combination of Whigs, Radicals, and Tory protectionists&quot;. Following this, on 29 June 1846, Peel resigned as prime minister.

=== Famine in Ireland ===
Though he knew repealing the laws would mean the end of his ministry, Peel decided to do so. It is possible that Peel merely used the Irish Famine as an excuse to repeal the Corn Laws as he had been an intellectual convert to free trade since the 1820s. Blake points out that if Peel had been convinced that total repeal was necessary to stave off the famine, he would have enacted a bill that brought about immediate temporary repeal, not permanent repeal over a three-year period of gradual tapering-off of duties.
Peel&#x27;s support for free trade could already be seen in his 1842 and 1845 budgets; in late 1842 Graham wrote to Peel that &quot;the next change in the Corn Laws must be to an open trade&quot; while arguing that the government should not tackle the issue. Speaking to the cabinet in 1844, Peel argued that the choice was the maintenance of the 1842 Corn Law or total repeal. The historian Boyd Hilton argued that Peel knew from 1844 he was going to be deposed as the Conservative leader. Many of his MPs had taken to voting against him, and the rupture within the party between liberals and paternalists, which had been so damaging in the 1820s but masked by the issue of parliamentary reform in the 1830s, was brought to the surface over the Corn Laws. Hilton&#x27;s hypothesis is that Peel wished to be deposed on a liberal issue so that he might later lead a Peelite/Whig/Liberal alliance. Peel was magnanimous towards Irish famine and permitted quick settlements of disputes at frontiers in India and America ( Treaty of Amritsar (1846) on 16 March 1846 and Oregon Treaty on 15 June 1846) in order to repeal Corn Laws on 29 June 1846. As an aside in reference to the repeal of the Corn Laws, Peel managed to keep minimum casualties of Irish Famine in its first year, Peel did make some moves to subsidise the purchase of food for the Irish, but this attempt was small and had little tangible effect. In the age of laissez-faire, government taxes were small, and subsidies or direct economic interference was almost nonexistent. That subsidies were actually given was very much out of character for the political times; his successor, Lord John Russell, received more criticism than Peel on Irish policy, the worst year being 1847, despite all of Peel&#x27;s efforts, his reform programmes had little effect on the situation in Ireland. Russell could not manage public distribution system during Irish Famine even though subsidized food from USA was made available in Ireland. The repeal of the Corn Laws became more political than humanitarian.

==Later career and death==
Peel did, however, retain a hard core of supporters, known as Peelites, and at one point in 1849 was actively courted by the Whig/Radical coalition. He continued to stand on his conservative principles, however, and refused. Nevertheless, he was influential on several important issues, including the furtherance of British free trade with the repeal of the Navigation Acts. Peel was a member of the committee which controlled the House of Commons Library, and on 16 April 1850 was responsible for passing the motion that controlled its scope and collection policy for the rest of the century.
Peel was thrown from his horse while riding on Constitution Hill in London on 29 June 1850. The horse stumbled on top of him, and he died three days later on 2 July at the age of 62 due to a broken collarbone rupturing his subclavian vessels.

His body was buried in the churchyard of St Peter Church, Drayton Bassett. Inside the church is a memorial tablet which reads &quot;In Memory of / The Rt Hon Sir Robert Peel, Bart. / to whome the People / have raised Monuments /in many places. / His Children / erect this in the place / where his body / has been buried&quot;.

His Peelite followers, led by Lord Aberdeen and William Gladstone, went on to fuse with the Whigs as the Liberal Party.

==Family==
Peel became engaged to Julia Floyd (1795–1859) (daughter of General Sir John Floyd, 1st Baronet, and his first wife Rebecca Darke) in March 1820; they married on 8 June 1820. They had seven children:
*Julia Peel (30 April 1821 – 14 August 1893). She married George Child Villiers, 6th Earl of Jersey, on 12 July 1841. They had five children. He died in 1859, and she married her second husband, Charles Brandling, on 12 September 1865.
*Sir Robert Peel, 3rd Baronet (4 May 1822 – 9 May 1895). He married Lady Emily Hay on 17 June 1856. They had five children. He succeeded his father in the baronecty in 1850.
*Frederick Peel (26 October 1823 – 6 June 1906). He married Elizabeth Shelley (niece of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley through his brother John) on 12 August 1857. She died on 30 July 1865. He was remarried to Janet Pleydell-Bouverie on 3 September 1879. 
*William Peel (2 November 1824 – 27 April 1858), a captain in the Royal Navy. 
*John Peel (24 May 1827 – 21 April 1910). He married Annie Jenny in 1851.
*Arthur Peel (3 August 1829 – 24 October 1912). He married Adelaide Dugdale, daughter of William Stratford Dugdale and Harriet Ella Portman, on 14 August 1862. They had seven children. He was created Viscount Peel in 1895; his eldest son William was created Earl Peel in 1929.
*Eliza Peel ( – April 1883). She married the Hon. Francis Stonor (son of Thomas Stonor, 3rd Baron Camoys) on 25 September 1855. They had four children.

Lady Peel died in 1859. Some of their direct descendants now reside in South Africa, the Australian states of New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania, and in various parts of the United States and Canada.

==Legacy==
===Memory and recognition===
In his lifetime many critics called him a traitor to the Tory cause, or as &quot;a Liberal wolf in sheep&#x27;s clothing&quot;, because his final position reflected liberal ideas. Others idealised Peel in heroic terms; Thomas Carlyle referred to him as a &quot;reforming Hercules&quot; in &quot;Latter-Day Pamphlets&quot; (1850).

The latter would become the consensus view of scholars for much of the 20th century. Historian Boyd Hilton wrote that he was portrayed as:

Biographer Norman Gash wrote that Peel &quot;looked first, not to party, but to the state; not to programmes, but to national expediency&quot;. Gash added that among his personal qualities were, &quot;administrative skill, capacity for work, personal integrity, high standards, a sense of duty [and] an outstanding intellect&quot;.

Gash emphasised the role of personality in Peel&#x27;s political career:

Peel was the first British Prime Minister to have been photographed while in office.
Peel is featured on the cover of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album.

A 2021 study in &quot;The Economic Journal&quot; found that the repeal of the corn laws adversely affected the welfare of the top 10% of income earners in Britain, whereas the bottom 90% of income earners gained.

A student association of the University of Glasgow, the Peel Club was founded in 1836 and named after Peel (who was a patron of the organisation). It later became the Glasgow University Conservative Association. In 2024, a group claiming to be the revived Peel Club was founded in Pall Mall, London.

===Art collector===
From 1820 Peel began amassing a major art collection, acquiring works by Dutch and Flemish Old Masters. He also commissioned a number of paintings by contemporary British artists including &quot;A Frost Scene&quot; by William Collins, &quot;Napoleon Musing at St Helena&quot; by Benjamin Robert Haydon and &quot;John Knox Preaching Before the Lords of Congregation&quot; by David Wilkie.

The biggest commissions Peel handed out were to Sir Thomas Lawrence, the President of the Royal Academy, who painted fifteen portraits for him between 1820 and his death in 1830. This made Peel Lawrence&#x27;s greatest patron after George IV. The works Lawrence produced featured leading politicians and prominent figures of literature as well as portraits of Peel&#x27;s family, notably his 1827 &quot;Portrait of Julia, Lady Peel&quot;. 
Peel displayed his Old Masters in his London residence at Whitehall Gardens, while Lawrence&#x27;s portraits were located in a dedicated gallery at Drayton Manor. Many of these works were then sold by his son to the National Gallery in 1871.

<text>Gérard Xavier Marcel Depardieu (, , ; born 27 December 1948) is a French actor, known to be one of the most prolific in film history. Icon of French cinema, a world star in the same way as Alain Delon or Brigitte Bardot, he has completed over 250 films since 1967, almost exclusively as a lead. Depardieu has worked with over 150 film directors whose most notable collaborations include Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, Maurice Pialat, Alain Resnais, Claude Chabrol, Ridley Scott, and Bernardo Bertolucci. He is the second highest-grossing actor in the history of French cinema behind Louis de Funès. As of January 2022, his body of work also includes countless television productions, 18 stage plays, 16 records and 9 books. He is known for having portrayed numerous leading historical and fictitious figures of the Western world including Georges Danton, Joseph Stalin, Honoré de Balzac, Alexandre Dumas, Auguste Rodin, Cyrano de Bergerac, Jean Valjean, Edmond Dantès, Christopher Columbus, Obélix, and Dominique Strauss-Kahn.

Depardieu is a Chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur and Chevalier of the Ordre national du Mérite. He was granted citizenship of Russia in January 2013 (officially adopted name in ), and became a cultural ambassador of Montenegro during the same month. Depardieu has received acclaim for his performances in &quot;The Last Metro&quot; (1980), for which he won the César Award for Best Actor, in &quot;Police&quot; (1985), for which he won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor, &quot;Jean de Florette&quot; (1986), and &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; (1990), for which he won the Best Actor award at the Cannes Film Festival and his second César Award for Best Actor as well as garnering a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. He co-starred in Peter Weir&#x27;s comedy &quot;Green Card&quot; (1990), winning a Golden Globe Award, and later acted in many big-budget Hollywood films, including Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;1492: Conquest of Paradise&quot; (1992), Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1996), Randall Wallace&#x27;s &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot; (1998), and Ang Lee&#x27;s &quot;Life of Pi&quot; (2012).

Depardieu has been repeatedly accused of sexual assault. The French authorities have charged him with rape and, since 2021, have had him under formal investigation. Depardieu has denied any wrongdoing and has not been convicted in connection with any of the accusations against him. He was stripped of the National Order of Quebec in 2023.

==Early life==

Gérard Xavier Marcel Depardieu was born on 27 December 1948 in Châteauroux, Indre, France. He is one of the five children of Anne Jeanne Josèphe (née Marillier), a stay-at-home mother known as &quot;La Lilette&quot;, and René Maxime Lionel Depardieu (better known in his neighborhood as &quot;Dédé&quot; because he could write only two letters), a metal worker and volunteer fireman. His father and mother were both born in 1923 and both died in 1988.

Depardieu grew up in poverty in a two-room apartment at 39 rue du Maréchal-Joffre, Châteauroux, in a working-class family, with five brothers and sisters. Depardieu helped his mother when she was in labour with his younger brothers and sisters. He spent more time on the streets than in school, leaving at the age of 13. Practically illiterate and half stammering, he learned to read only later. He worked at a printworks, and took part in boxing matches in his spare time. He also became involved in selling stolen goods, and was put on probation.

During a difficult adolescence, he turned to theft and smuggling all kinds of goods, notably cigarettes and alcohol), to the GIs at the large American air base of Châteauroux-Déols. He also acted as a bodyguard for prostitutes who came down from Paris on weekends, the GIs&#x27; payday. His family nicknamed him &quot;Pétard&quot; or &quot;Pétarou&quot;, because of the habit he had acquired of breaking wind incessantly. In 1968, Depardieu&#x27;s childhood best friend Jacky Merveille, also a kingpin from Châteauroux, died in a car accident, prompting him to take decisive control over his future.

==Acting career==

At the age of 16, Depardieu left Châteauroux for Paris. There, he began acting in the new comedy theatre Café de la Gare, along with Patrick Dewaere, Romain Bouteille, Sotha, Coluche, and Miou-Miou. He studied theater under Jean-Laurent Cochet. Regardless of his lack of culture, he heavily studied the classics and followed a therapy to correct his disastrous diction and improve his memory. Moreover, through his first wife, Élisabeth Guignot, he discovered the Parisian bourgeoisie. Thus, he met Agnès Varda and her husband Jacques Demy. His first film role to gain attention was playing Jean-Claude in Bertrand Blier&#x27;s comedy &quot;Les Valseuses&quot; (&quot;Going Places&quot;, 1974). Other prominent early films include Barbet Schroeder&#x27;s controversial &quot;Maîtresse&quot; (1975), a starring role in Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s historical epic &quot;1900&quot; (1976), with Robert De Niro, and a role in François Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;The Last Metro&quot; (1980), with Catherine Deneuve for which he won his first César Award for Best Actor. Depardieu and Deneuve have since made nine more films together.

Depardieu&#x27;s international profile rose as a result of his performance as a doomed, hunchbacked farmer in the film &quot;Jean de Florette&quot; (1986) and received notice for his starring role in &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; (1990), for which he won his second César Award for Best Actor, the Cannes Film Festival for Best Actor, and received a nomination for an Academy Award. Depardieu co-starred in Peter Weir&#x27;s English language romantic comedy &quot;Green Card&quot; (1991), for which he won a Golden Globe Award. He has since had other roles in other English language films, including Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;1492: Conquest of Paradise&quot; (1992), Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1996), &quot;102 Dalmatians&quot; (2000, &quot;Between Strangers&quot; (2002), and Ang Lee&#x27;s &quot;Life of Pi&quot; (2012). He played Obélix in the four live-action &quot;Astérix&quot; films in which he is said to have discovered Mélanie Laurent when she was fourteen. In 2009, he took part in a rare performance of Sardou&#x27;s &quot;La Haine&quot; at the Festival de Radio France et Montpellier Languedoc Roussillon, with Fanny Ardant; subsequently broadcast on France Musique. In 2013, he starred in an independent film titled &quot;A Farewell to Fools&quot;. Depardieu featured as a main character in Antwerp (Edinburgh Festival 2014), a play in The Europeans Trilogy (Bruges, Antwerp, Tervuren) by Paris-based UK playwright Nick Awde. In 2014, he starred in the controversial &quot;Welcome to New York&quot; in the thinly-disguised impersonation of disgraced former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn.

==Personal life==

In 1970, Depardieu married Élisabeth Guignot, with whom he had two children: actor Guillaume (1971–2008) and actress Julie (b. 1973). On 28 January 1992, while separated from Guignot, he had a daughter, Roxanne, with the model Karine Silla (sister of producer Virginie Besson-Silla). In 1996, he divorced Guignot and began a relationship with actress Carole Bouquet, his partner from 1997 to 2005. On 14 July 2006, he had a son, Jean, with French-Cambodian Hélène Bizot (daughter of François Bizot, not actress Hélène Bizot). Between 2005 and 2023, Depardieu was in a relationship with Clémentine Igou. Since 2024, he is in a relationship with Magda Vavrusova.

On 13 October 2008, Depardieu&#x27;s son Guillaume died from pneumonia at the age of 37. Guillaume&#x27;s health had been adversely affected by drug addiction and a 1995 motorcycle crash that eventually required the amputation of his right leg in 2003. Depardieu and Guillaume had a turbulent relationship but had reconciled prior to Guillaume&#x27;s death. In September 2020, Depardieu converted to Eastern Orthodox Christianity in Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Paris.

=== Health ===
On 18 May 1998, Depardieu had a motorcycle accident with a high blood alcohol content, of 2.5 g/L on the way to the shooting of &quot;Asterix and Obelix vs. Caesar&quot;, by Claude Zidi. He was prescribed forty days off work. In 2000, Depardieu underwent heart bypass surgery after two weeks of chest pains. As Depardieu weighed at the end of 2008, film critic Pascal Mérigeau commented on Depardieu&#x27;s large amounts of food consumption, &quot;at lunch he ingests of red meat, swallows handfuls of saltine crackers&quot;. In 2011, he was removed from a Cityjet flight to Dublin after refusing to sit down due to being refused access to the toilet and urinated in a bottle. Depardieu apologised for this and his fellow actor Edouard Baer attributed it to prostate issues.

In 2012, Depardieu was hit by a car while riding his scooter in Paris. The same year, while intoxicated with 1.8 g/L of alcohol in the blood, he had another scooter accident, without injury and without collision with another party. Since the 2000s, he has suffered at least seven motorcycle or scooter accidents. In September 2014, Depardieu stated he drank twelve, thirteen or fourteen bottles of alcohol daily, starting at 10:00 a.m., drinking champagne, wine, and pastis, and ending the day with vodka, whisky, or both. He said: &quot;I&#x27;m never totally drunk, just a bit of a pain in the ass&quot;. Laurent Audiot, the chef of the Parisian restaurant &quot;La Fontaine Gaillon&quot;, compared Depardieu to Gargantua, saying that &quot;he has excessive energy and he compensates with food, but sometimes it takes on incredible proportions&quot;.

===Sexual assault and rape allegations===
In 1991, &quot;Time&quot; magazine published a translation of a 1978 interview in which Depardieu apparently confirmed a rumour that he first participated in a rape when he was nine years old and that he had participated in more rapes since then. He reportedly stated there were &quot;too many [rapes] to count... There was nothing wrong with it. The girls wanted to be raped. I mean, there&#x27;s no such thing as rape. It&#x27;s only a matter of a girl putting herself in a situation where she wants to be.&quot; The story re-emerged in 1991. On 15 March 1991, Depardieu&#x27;s American publicist Lois Smith, stated: &quot;He&#x27;s sorry, but it happened&quot;. The National Organization for Women requested an apology from Depardieu. Later that month, Depardieu&#x27;s French publicist Claude Devy discounted the statements made by Smith, and Depardieu threatened legal action against any media outlet that published the comments. Depardieu&#x27;s team said that Time had mistranslated the word &quot;assister&quot; as &quot;participate&quot;, when a more accurate translation would be &quot;attend&quot; or &quot;be witness to&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; refused to retract the story and claimed that Depardieu had told them he had &quot;participated&quot; in the rapes.

In August 2018, Depardieu was accused of sexual assault and rape by a 22-year-old actress and dancer. The actress reported being assaulted twice by Depardieu in his home during rehearsal sessions. The unnamed actress made her statement to police in Lambesc, southern France, after which the case was passed to prosecutors in the capital. Depardieu denied the allegations. In 2019, the charges were dropped after a nine-month police investigation. The case was reopened in October 2020 after his accuser refiled the complaint. In February 2021, it was announced that French authorities had charged Depardieu with rape in December 2020, stemming from the incident in August 2018. According to Depardieu&#x27;s lawyer, Hervé Témime, speaking to , the actor rejects the allegation. In March 2022, the Paris Court of Appeal rejected Depardieu&#x27;s attempt to have the charges dropped and announced the actor will remain under formal investigation. Following this investigation, the case will either be brought to trial or dismissed.

In April 2023, 13 women accused Depardieu of sexual assault and sexual harassment pertaining to incidents that occurred between 2004 and 2022. On 19 December 2023, , a Spanish author, photographer and journalist, told &quot;La Vanguardia&quot; that Depardieu had kissed and groped her without her consent in 1995 when she was 23, after she had interviewed him in Paris for &quot;Cinemania&quot; magazine, and that she has filed a complaint. Baza explained that her mind blocked out the events due to the severe trauma she experienced, being so young and struggling with chronic anorexia and depression although she was already a respected and experienced correspondent and photographer. The events remained blocked through the years until the allegations against him emerged in 2023, which had a profound impact on her. She experienced flashbacks as she regained the memories of this traumatic event that her memory had buried, which were corroborated when she discovered and reread the description of the 1995 events in her diary from that year. The Coalition For Women In Journalism and Women Press Freedom stand in solidarity with Baza and highlighted in a estatement her courage in speaking out about a rape that allegedly occurred nearly 30 years ago is not only commendable but also essential in the ongoing fight against sexual violence and the culture of silence in the media and entertainment industries.

One of his accusers, Emmanuelle Debever, who had made allegations against Depardieu, committed suicide and died on 6 December 2023 after one week at the hospital. On 25 December 2023, a group of over 50 French actors and other prominent figures including Charlotte Rampling, Carla Bruni, and Carole Bouquet, denounced the &quot;lynching&quot; of Depardieu, in an open letter published in French newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot;. The group claims the star is the victim of a &quot;torrent of hatred&quot;, adding &quot;Gérard Depardieu is probably the greatest of all actors&quot;. His former partner Karine Silla defends him. Some of his colleagues have spoken out against him, including Sophie Marceau, Muriel Robin and Swann Arlaud. On 29 April 2024, the police detained Depardieu for questioning. A trial on two counts of sexual assault was scheduled to begin on October 28, 2024. Depardieu&#x27;s lawyer said that health concerns meant he was unable to attend court. The trial was rescheduled to March 24, 2025.

===Removal from the National Order of Quebec===
On 13 December 2023, Gérard Depardieu was stripped of the National Order of Quebec. This was prompted by what Quebec premier François Legault called &quot;scandalous remarks made by Gérard Depardieu in front of the cameras,&quot; which had, in the premier&#x27;s view, &quot;shocked the international public, with good reason&quot;. He had been appointed as a Knight of the National Order of Quebec in 2002 by premier Bernard Landry.

===Citizenship===

Depardieu has been an official resident of Néchin, Belgium, since 7 December 2012. French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault criticised his move. On 15 December 2012, Depardieu publicly stated he was handing back his French passport. On 3 January 2013, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed an Executive Order granting Russian citizenship to Depardieu. In his first interview thereafter, Depardieu attacked Putin&#x27;s critics for &quot;lacking vision&quot;. In his autobiography, Depardieu said Putin &quot;immediately liked my hooligan side.&quot; In February 2013, he registered as a resident of Saransk. Also in January 2013, he was appointed a cultural ambassador for Montenegro. In the summer of 2015, Depardieu&#x27;s films were banned from television and cinemas in Ukraine due to his remarks questioning Ukraine&#x27;s right to exist as an independent state. In February 2022, Depardieu revealed that he had become a citizen of the United Arab Emirates, although he did not specify when this occurred. In March 2022, he condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and accused Russian President Putin of &quot;crazy, unacceptable excesses&quot;.

===Wealth===
In 1983, Depardieu created DD Productions to co-produce his films. Apart from his acting career, Depardieu is also a viticulturist, having invested in vineyards at the end of the 1980s. He owns wine estates in the Médoc, Hérault, Burgundy, Eastern Europe, Maghreb, and South America. In addition, Depardieu is the owner of the &quot;Château de Tigné&quot; (Tigne Castle) in Anjou. He also collects works of art and motorcycles. In 2003, Depardieu bought the restaurant &quot;La Fontaine Gaillon&quot; in the 2nd arrondissement of Paris. Its wine cellar, which consisted of bottles of Château Haut-Brion, Château Latour, Meursault and Saint-Émilion, was rewarded by the Gault Millau guide. &quot;La Fontaine Gaillon&quot; was described as &quot;a Parisian institution&quot;. In Paris, Depardieu owns luxury restaurants, a Japanese delicatessen, a wine bar, and a seafood shop. By 2012, he employed over a hundred people in France through fifteen companies. In 2013, Depardieu&#x27;s wealth was valued at US$200 million. Depardieu owns a luxury hotel built in 1805 in the 6th arrondissement of Paris valued at 50 million euros ($53.5 million). Depardieu sold &quot;La Fontaine Gaillon&quot; in 2019.

<text>In mathematics, a subalgebra is a subset of an algebra, closed under all its operations, and carrying the induced operations.

&quot;Algebra&quot;, when referring to a structure, often means a vector space or module equipped with an additional bilinear operation. Algebras in universal algebra are far more general: they are a common generalisation of &quot;all&quot; algebraic structures. &quot;Subalgebra&quot; can refer to either case.

== Subalgebras for algebras over a ring or field ==

A subalgebra of an algebra over a commutative ring or field is a vector subspace which is closed under the multiplication of vectors. The restriction of the algebra multiplication makes it an algebra over the same ring or field. This notion also applies to most specializations, where the multiplication must satisfy additional properties, e.g. to associative algebras or to Lie algebras. Only for unital algebras is there a stronger notion, of unital subalgebra, for which it is also required that the unit of the subalgebra be the unit of the bigger algebra.

=== Example ===

The 2×2-matrices over the reals R form a four-dimensional unital algebra M(2,R) in the obvious way. The 2×2-matrices for which all entries are zero, except for the first one on the diagonal, form a subalgebra. It is also unital, but it is not a unital subalgebra.

The identity element of M(2,R) is the identity matrix I , so the unital subalgebras contain the line of diagonal matrices {&quot;x&quot; I : &quot;x&quot; in R}. For two-dimensional subalgebras, consider
:formula_1
When &quot;p&quot; = 0, then E is nilpotent and the subalgebra { &quot;x&quot; I + &quot;y&quot; E : &quot;x, y&quot; in R } is a copy of the dual number plane. When &quot;p&quot; is negative, take &quot;q&quot; = 1/√−&quot;p&quot;, so that (&quot;q&quot; E)2 = − I, and subalgebra { &quot;x&quot; I + &quot;y&quot; (&quot;q&quot;E) : &quot;x,y&quot; in R } is a copy of the complex plane. Finally, when &quot;p&quot; is positive, take &quot;q&quot; = 1/√&quot;p&quot;, so that (&quot;q&quot;E)2 = I, and subalgebra { &quot;x&quot; I + &quot;y&quot; (&quot;q&quot;E) : &quot;x,y&quot; in R } is a copy of the plane of split-complex numbers. By the law of trichotomy, these are the only planar subalgebras of M(2,R).

== Subalgebras in universal algebra ==

In universal algebra, a subalgebra of an algebra &quot;A&quot; is a subset &quot;S&quot; of &quot;A&quot; that also has the structure of an algebra of the same type when the algebraic operations are restricted to &quot;S&quot;. If the axioms of a kind of algebraic structure is described by equational laws, as is typically the case in universal algebra, then the only thing that needs to be checked is that &quot;S&quot; is &quot;closed&quot; under the operations.

Some authors consider algebras with partial functions. There are various ways of defining subalgebras for these. Another generalization of algebras is to allow relations. These more general algebras are usually called structures, and they are studied in model theory and in theoretical computer science. For structures with relations there are notions of weak and of induced substructures.

=== Example ===
For example, the standard signature for groups in universal algebra is . (Inversion and unit are needed to get the right notions of homomorphism and so that the group laws can be expressed as equations.) Therefore, a subgroup of a group &quot;G&quot; is a subset &quot;S&quot; of &quot;G&quot; such that:
* the identity &quot;e&quot; of &quot;G&quot; belongs to &quot;S&quot; (so that &quot;S&quot; is closed under the identity constant operation);
* whenever &quot;x&quot; belongs to &quot;S&quot;, so does &quot;x&quot;−1 (so that &quot;S&quot; is closed under the inverse operation);
* whenever &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; belong to &quot;S&quot;, so does (so that &quot;S&quot; is closed under the group&#x27;s multiplication operation).

<text>In algebra, the kernel of a homomorphism (function that preserves the structure) is generally the inverse image of 0 (except for groups whose operation is denoted multiplicatively, where the kernel is the inverse image of 1). An important special case is the kernel of a linear map. The kernel of a matrix, also called the &quot;null space&quot;, is the kernel of the linear map defined by the matrix. 

The kernel of a homomorphism is reduced to 0 (or 1) if and only if the homomorphism is injective, that is if the inverse image of every element consists of a single element. This means that the kernel can be viewed as a measure of the degree to which the homomorphism fails to be injective. 

For some types of structure, such as abelian groups and vector spaces, the possible kernels are exactly the substructures of the same type. This is not always the case, and, sometimes, the possible kernels have received a special name, such as normal subgroup for groups and two-sided ideals for rings.

Kernels allow defining quotient objects (also called quotient algebras in universal algebra, and cokernels in category theory). For many types of algebraic structure, the fundamental theorem on homomorphisms (or first isomorphism theorem) states that image of a homomorphism is isomorphic to the quotient by the kernel.

The concept of a kernel has been extended to structures such that the inverse image of a single element is not sufficient for deciding whether a homomorphism is injective. In these cases, the kernel is a congruence relation.

This article is a survey for some important types of kernels in algebraic structures.

== Survey of examples ==

=== Linear maps ===
Let &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; be vector spaces over a field (or more generally, modules over a ring) and let &quot;T&quot; be a linear map from &quot;V&quot; to &quot;W&quot;. If 0&quot;W&quot; is the zero vector of &quot;W&quot;, then the kernel of &quot;T&quot; is the preimage of the zero subspace {0&quot;W&quot;}; that is, the subset of &quot;V&quot; consisting of all those elements of &quot;V&quot; that are mapped by &quot;T&quot; to the element 0&quot;W&quot;. The kernel is usually denoted as , or some variation thereof:
: formula_1

Since a linear map preserves zero vectors, the zero vector 0&quot;V&quot; of &quot;V&quot; must belong to the kernel. The transformation &quot;T&quot; is injective if and only if its kernel is reduced to the zero subspace.

The kernel ker &quot;T&quot; is always a linear subspace of &quot;V&quot;. Thus, it makes sense to speak of the quotient space . The first isomorphism theorem for vector spaces states that this quotient space is naturally isomorphic to the image of &quot;T&quot; (which is a subspace of &quot;W&quot;). As a consequence, the dimension of &quot;V&quot; equals the dimension of the kernel plus the dimension of the image.

If &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; are finite-dimensional and bases have been chosen, then &quot;T&quot; can be described by a matrix &quot;M&quot;, and the kernel can be computed by solving the homogeneous system of linear equations . In this case, the kernel of &quot;T&quot; may be identified to the kernel of the matrix &quot;M&quot;, also called &quot;null space&quot; of &quot;M&quot;. The dimension of the null space, called the nullity of &quot;M&quot;, is given by the number of columns of &quot;M&quot; minus the rank of &quot;M&quot;, as a consequence of the rank–nullity theorem.

Solving homogeneous differential equations often amounts to computing the kernel of certain differential operators.
For instance, in order to find all twice-differentiable functions &quot;f&quot; from the real line to itself such that
: formula_2
let &quot;V&quot; be the space of all twice differentiable functions, let &quot;W&quot; be the space of all functions, and define a linear operator &quot;T&quot; from &quot;V&quot; to &quot;W&quot; by
: formula_3
for &quot;f&quot; in &quot;V&quot; and &quot;x&quot; an arbitrary real number.
Then all solutions to the differential equation are in .

One can define kernels for homomorphisms between modules over a ring in an analogous manner. This includes kernels for homomorphisms between abelian groups as a special case. This example captures the essence of kernels in general abelian categories; see Kernel (category theory).

=== Group homomorphisms ===
Let &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; be groups and let &quot;f&quot; be a group homomorphism from &quot;G&quot; to &quot;H&quot;. If &quot;e&quot;&quot;H&quot; is the identity element of &quot;H&quot;, then the &quot;kernel&quot; of &quot;f&quot; is the preimage of the singleton set {&quot;e&quot;&quot;H&quot;}; that is, the subset of &quot;G&quot; consisting of all those elements of &quot;G&quot; that are mapped by &quot;f&quot; to the element &quot;e&quot;&quot;H&quot;.

The kernel is usually denoted (or a variation). In symbols:
: formula_4

Since a group homomorphism preserves identity elements, the identity element &quot;e&quot;&quot;G&quot; of &quot;G&quot; must belong to the kernel.

The homomorphism &quot;f&quot; is injective if and only if its kernel is only the singleton set {&quot;e&quot;&quot;G&quot;}. If &quot;f&quot; were not injective, then the non-injective elements can form a distinct element of its kernel: there would exist such that and . Thus . &quot;f&quot; is a group homomorphism, so inverses and group operations are preserved, giving ; in other words, , and ker &quot;f&quot; would not be the singleton. Conversely, distinct elements of the kernel violate injectivity directly: if there would exist an element , then , thus &quot;f&quot; would not be injective.

 is a subgroup of &quot;G&quot; and further it is a normal subgroup. Thus, there is a corresponding quotient group . This is isomorphic to &quot;f&quot;(&quot;G&quot;), the image of &quot;G&quot; under &quot;f&quot; (which is a subgroup of &quot;H&quot; also), by the first isomorphism theorem for groups.

In the special case of abelian groups, there is no deviation from the previous section.

==== Example ====
Let &quot;G&quot; be the cyclic group on 6 elements with modular addition, &quot;H&quot; be the cyclic on 2 elements with modular addition, and &quot;f&quot; the homomorphism that maps each element &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot; to the element &quot;g&quot; modulo 2 in &quot;H&quot;. Then , since all these elements are mapped to 0&quot;H&quot;. The quotient group has two elements: and . It is indeed isomorphic to &quot;H&quot;.

=== Ring homomorphisms ===
Let &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; be rings (assumed unital) and let &quot;f&quot; be a ring homomorphism from &quot;R&quot; to &quot;S&quot;.
If 0&quot;S&quot; is the zero element of &quot;S&quot;, then the &quot;kernel&quot; of &quot;f&quot; is its kernel as linear map over the integers, or, equivalently, as additive groups. It is the preimage of the zero ideal , which is, the subset of &quot;R&quot; consisting of all those elements of &quot;R&quot; that are mapped by &quot;f&quot; to the element 0&quot;S&quot;.
The kernel is usually denoted (or a variation).
In symbols:
: formula_5

Since a ring homomorphism preserves zero elements, the zero element 0&quot;R&quot; of &quot;R&quot; must belong to the kernel.
The homomorphism &quot;f&quot; is injective if and only if its kernel is only the singleton set .
This is always the case if &quot;R&quot; is a field, and &quot;S&quot; is not the zero ring.

Since ker &quot;f&quot; contains the multiplicative identity only when &quot;S&quot; is the zero ring, it turns out that the kernel is generally not a subring of &quot;R.&quot; The kernel is a subrng, and, more precisely, a two-sided ideal of &quot;R&quot;.
Thus, it makes sense to speak of the quotient ring .
The first isomorphism theorem for rings states that this quotient ring is naturally isomorphic to the image of &quot;f&quot; (which is a subring of &quot;S&quot;). (Note that rings need not be unital for the kernel definition).

To some extent, this can be thought of as a special case of the situation for modules, since these are all bimodules over a ring &quot;R&quot;:
* &quot;R&quot; itself;
* any two-sided ideal of &quot;R&quot; (such as ker &quot;f&quot;);
* any quotient ring of &quot;R&quot; (such as ); and
* the codomain of any ring homomorphism whose domain is &quot;R&quot; (such as &quot;S&quot;, the codomain of &quot;f&quot;).
However, the isomorphism theorem gives a stronger result, because ring isomorphisms preserve multiplication while module isomorphisms (even between rings) in general do not.

This example captures the essence of kernels in general Mal&#x27;cev algebras.

=== Monoid homomorphisms ===
Let &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; be monoids and let &quot;f&quot; be a monoid homomorphism from &quot;M&quot; to &quot;N&quot;. Then the &quot;kernel&quot; of &quot;f&quot; is the subset of the direct product consisting of all those ordered pairs of elements of &quot;M&quot; whose components are both mapped by &quot;f&quot; to the same element in &quot;N&quot;. The kernel is usually denoted (or a variation thereof). In symbols:
: formula_6

Since &quot;f&quot; is a function, the elements of the form must belong to the kernel. The homomorphism &quot;f&quot; is injective if and only if its kernel is only the diagonal set .

It turns out that is an equivalence relation on &quot;M&quot;, and in fact a congruence relation. Thus, it makes sense to speak of the quotient monoid . The first isomorphism theorem for monoids states that this quotient monoid is naturally isomorphic to the image of &quot;f&quot; (which is a submonoid of &quot;N&quot;; for the congruence relation).

This is very different in flavour from the above examples. In particular, the preimage of the identity element of &quot;N&quot; is &quot;not&quot; enough to determine the kernel of &quot;f&quot;.

== Universal algebra ==
All the above cases may be unified and generalized in universal algebra.

=== General case ===
Let &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; be algebraic structures of a given type and let &quot;f&quot; be a homomorphism of that type from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;.
Then the &quot;kernel&quot; of &quot;f&quot; is the subset of the direct product consisting of all those ordered pairs of elements of &quot;A&quot; whose components are both mapped by &quot;f&quot; to the same element in &quot;B&quot;.
The kernel is usually denoted (or a variation).
In symbols:
: formula_7

Since &quot;f&quot; is a function, the elements of the form must belong to the kernel.

The homomorphism &quot;f&quot; is injective if and only if its kernel is exactly the diagonal set .

It is easy to see that ker &quot;f&quot; is an equivalence relation on &quot;A&quot;, and in fact a congruence relation.
Thus, it makes sense to speak of the quotient algebra .
The first isomorphism theorem in general universal algebra states that this quotient algebra is naturally isomorphic to the image of &quot;f&quot; (which is a subalgebra of &quot;B&quot;).

Note that the definition of kernel here (as in the monoid example) doesn&#x27;t depend on the algebraic structure; it is a purely set-theoretic concept.
For more on this general concept, outside of abstract algebra, see kernel of a function.

=== Malcev algebras ===

In the case of Malcev algebras, this construction can be simplified. Every Malcev algebra has a special neutral element (the zero vector in the case of vector spaces, the identity element in the case of commutative groups, and the zero element in the case of rings or modules). The characteristic feature of a Malcev algebra is that we can recover the entire equivalence relation ker &quot;f&quot; from the equivalence class of the neutral element.

To be specific, let &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; be Malcev algebraic structures of a given type and let &quot;f&quot; be a homomorphism of that type from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;. If &quot;e&quot;&quot;B&quot; is the neutral element of &quot;B&quot;, then the &quot;kernel&quot; of &quot;f&quot; is the preimage of the singleton set {&quot;e&quot;&quot;B&quot;}; that is, the subset of &quot;A&quot; consisting of all those elements of &quot;A&quot; that are mapped by &quot;f&quot; to the element &quot;e&quot;&quot;B&quot;.
The kernel is usually denoted (or a variation). In symbols:
: formula_8

Since a Malcev algebra homomorphism preserves neutral elements, the identity element &quot;e&quot;&quot;A&quot; of &quot;A&quot; must belong to the kernel. The homomorphism &quot;f&quot; is injective if and only if its kernel is only the singleton set .

The notion of ideal generalises to any Malcev algebra (as linear subspace in the case of vector spaces, normal subgroup in the case of groups, two-sided ideals in the case of rings, and submodule in the case of modules). 
It turns out that ker &quot;f&quot; is not a subalgebra of &quot;A&quot;, but it is an ideal.
Then it makes sense to speak of the quotient algebra .
The first isomorphism theorem for Malcev algebras states that this quotient algebra is naturally isomorphic to the image of &quot;f&quot; (which is a subalgebra of &quot;B&quot;).

The connection between this and the congruence relation for more general types of algebras is as follows.
First, the kernel-as-an-ideal is the equivalence class of the neutral element &quot;e&quot;&quot;A&quot; under the kernel-as-a-congruence. For the converse direction, we need the notion of quotient in the Mal&#x27;cev algebra (which is division on either side for groups and subtraction for vector spaces, modules, and rings).
Using this, elements &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; of &quot;A&quot; are equivalent under the kernel-as-a-congruence if and only if their quotient &quot;a&quot;/&quot;b&quot; is an element of the kernel-as-an-ideal.

== Algebras with nonalgebraic structure ==
Sometimes algebras are equipped with a nonalgebraic structure in addition to their algebraic operations.
For example, one may consider topological groups or topological vector spaces, which are equipped with a topology.
In this case, we would expect the homomorphism &quot;f&quot; to preserve this additional structure; in the topological examples, we would want &quot;f&quot; to be a continuous map.
The process may run into a snag with the quotient algebras, which may not be well-behaved.
In the topological examples, we can avoid problems by requiring that topological algebraic structures be Hausdorff (as is usually done); then the kernel (however it is constructed) will be a closed set and the quotient space will work fine (and also be Hausdorff).

== Kernels in category theory ==
The notion of &quot;kernel&quot; in category theory is a generalisation of the kernels of abelian algebras; see Kernel (category theory).
The categorical generalisation of the kernel as a congruence relation is the &quot;kernel pair&quot;.
(There is also the notion of difference kernel, or binary equaliser.)

<text>In mathematics, specifically abstract algebra, the isomorphism theorems (also known as Noether&#x27;s isomorphism theorems) are theorems that describe the relationship among quotients, homomorphisms, and subobjects. Versions of the theorems exist for groups, rings, vector spaces, modules, Lie algebras, and other algebraic structures. In universal algebra, the isomorphism theorems can be generalized to the context of algebras and congruences.

== History ==
The isomorphism theorems were formulated in some generality for homomorphisms of modules by Emmy Noether in her paper &quot;Abstrakter Aufbau der Idealtheorie in algebraischen Zahl- und Funktionenkörpern&quot;, which was published in 1927 in Mathematische Annalen. Less general versions of these theorems can be found in work of Richard Dedekind and previous papers by Noether.

Three years later, B.L. van der Waerden published his influential &quot;Moderne Algebra&quot;, the first abstract algebra textbook that took the groups-rings-fields approach to the subject. Van der Waerden credited lectures by Noether on group theory and Emil Artin on algebra, as well as a seminar conducted by Artin, Wilhelm Blaschke, Otto Schreier, and van der Waerden himself on ideals as the main references. The three isomorphism theorems, called &quot;homomorphism theorem&quot;, and &quot;two laws of isomorphism&quot; when applied to groups, appear explicitly.

== Groups ==
We first present the isomorphism theorems of the groups.

===Theorem A (groups)===


Let &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; be groups, and let &quot;f&quot; : &quot;G&quot; → &quot;H&quot; be a homomorphism. Then:
# The kernel of &quot;f&quot; is a normal subgroup of &quot;G&quot;,
# The image of &quot;f&quot; is a subgroup of &quot;H&quot;, and
# The image of &quot;f&quot; is isomorphic to the quotient group &quot;G&quot; / ker(&quot;f&quot;).
In particular, if &quot;f&quot; is surjective then &quot;H&quot; is isomorphic to &quot;G&quot; / ker(&quot;f&quot;).

This theorem is usually called the &quot;first isomorphism theorem&quot;.

===Theorem B (groups)===

Let formula_1 be a group. Let formula_2 be a subgroup of formula_1, and let formula_4 be a normal subgroup of formula_1. Then the following hold:
# The product formula_6 is a subgroup of formula_1,
# The subgroup formula_4 is a normal subgroup of formula_6,
# The intersection formula_10 is a normal subgroup of formula_2, and
# The quotient groups formula_12 and formula_13 are isomorphic.
Technically, it is not necessary for formula_4 to be a normal subgroup, as long as formula_2 is a subgroup of the normalizer of formula_4 in formula_1. In this case, formula_4 is not a normal subgroup of formula_1, but formula_4 is still a normal subgroup of the product formula_6.

This theorem is sometimes called the &quot;second isomorphism theorem&quot;, &quot;diamond theorem&quot; or the &quot;parallelogram theorem&quot;.

An application of the second isomorphism theorem identifies projective linear groups: for example, the group on the complex projective line starts with setting formula_22, the group of invertible 2 × 2 complex matrices, formula_23, the subgroup of determinant 1 matrices, and formula_4 the normal subgroup of scalar matrices formula_25, we have formula_26, where formula_27 is the identity matrix, and formula_28. Then the second isomorphism theorem states that:

: formula_29

===Theorem C (groups)===
Let formula_1 be a group, and formula_4 a normal subgroup of formula_1.
Then
# If formula_33 is a subgroup of formula_1 such that formula_35, then formula_36 has a subgroup isomorphic to formula_37.
# Every subgroup of formula_36 is of the form formula_37 for some subgroup formula_33 of formula_1 such that formula_35.
# If formula_33 is a normal subgroup of formula_1 such that formula_35, then formula_36 has a normal subgroup isomorphic to formula_37.
# Every normal subgroup of formula_36 is of the form formula_37 for some normal subgroup formula_33 of formula_1 such that formula_35.
# If formula_33 is a normal subgroup of formula_1 such that formula_35, then the quotient group formula_56 is isomorphic to formula_57.

The last statement is sometimes referred to as the &quot;third isomorphism theorem&quot;. The first four statements are often subsumed under Theorem D below, and referred to as the &quot;lattice theorem&quot;, &quot;correspondence theorem&quot;, or &quot;fourth isomorphism theorem&quot;.

===Theorem D (groups)===
Let formula_1 be a group, and formula_4 a normal subgroup of formula_1.
The canonical projection homomorphism formula_61 defines a bijective correspondence
between the set of subgroups of formula_1 containing formula_4 and the set of (all) subgroups of formula_36. Under this correspondence normal subgroups correspond to normal subgroups. 

This theorem is sometimes called the &quot;correspondence theorem&quot;, the &quot;lattice theorem&quot;, and the &quot;fourth isomorphism theorem&quot;.

The Zassenhaus lemma (also known as the butterfly lemma) is sometimes called the fourth isomorphism theorem.

=== Discussion ===

The first isomorphism theorem can be expressed in category theoretical language by saying that the category of groups is (normal epi, mono)-factorizable; in other words, the normal epimorphisms and the monomorphisms form a factorization system for the category. This is captured in the commutative diagram in the margin, which shows the objects and morphisms whose existence can be deduced from the morphism formula_65. The diagram shows that every morphism in the category of groups has a kernel in the category theoretical sense; the arbitrary morphism &quot;f&quot; factors into formula_66, where &quot;ι&quot; is a monomorphism and &quot;π&quot; is an epimorphism (in a conormal category, all epimorphisms are normal). This is represented in the diagram by an object formula_67 and a monomorphism formula_68 (kernels are always monomorphisms), which complete the short exact sequence running from the lower left to the upper right of the diagram. The use of the exact sequence convention saves us from having to draw the zero morphisms from formula_67 to formula_70 and formula_71.

If the sequence is right split (i.e., there is a morphism &quot;σ&quot; that maps formula_72 to a -preimage of itself), then &quot;G&quot; is the semidirect product of the normal subgroup formula_73 and the subgroup formula_74. If it is left split (i.e., there exists some formula_75 such that formula_76), then it must also be right split, and formula_77 is a direct product decomposition of &quot;G&quot;. In general, the existence of a right split does not imply the existence of a left split; but in an abelian category (such as that of abelian groups), left splits and right splits are equivalent by the splitting lemma, and a right split is sufficient to produce a direct sum decomposition formula_78. In an abelian category, all monomorphisms are also normal, and the diagram may be extended by a second short exact sequence formula_79.

In the second isomorphism theorem, the product &quot;SN&quot; is the join of &quot;S&quot; and &quot;N&quot; in the lattice of subgroups of &quot;G&quot;, while the intersection &quot;S&quot; ∩ &quot;N&quot; is the meet.

The third isomorphism theorem is generalized by the nine lemma to abelian categories and more general maps between objects.

=== Note on numbers and names ===
Below we present four theorems, labelled A, B, C and D. They are often numbered as &quot;First isomorphism theorem&quot;, &quot;Second...&quot; and so on; however, there is no universal agreement on the numbering. Here we give some examples of the group isomorphism theorems in the literature. Notice that these theorems have analogs for rings and modules.


It is less common to include the Theorem D, usually known as the &quot;lattice theorem&quot; or the &quot;correspondence theorem&quot;, as one of isomorphism theorems, but when included, it is the last one.

== Rings ==
The statements of the theorems for rings are similar, with the notion of a normal subgroup replaced by the notion of an ideal.

=== Theorem A (rings) ===
Let formula_80 and formula_2 be rings, and let formula_82 be a ring homomorphism. Then:
# The kernel of formula_83 is an ideal of formula_80,
# The image of formula_83 is a subring of formula_2, and
# The image of formula_83 is isomorphic to the quotient ring formula_88.
In particular, if formula_83 is surjective then formula_2 is isomorphic to formula_88.

=== Theorem B (rings) ===
Let &quot;R&quot; be a ring. Let &quot;S&quot; be a subring of &quot;R&quot;, and let &quot;I&quot; be an ideal of &quot;R&quot;. Then:
# The sum &quot;S&quot; + &quot;I&quot; = {&quot;s&quot; + &quot;i&quot; | &quot;s&quot; ∈ &quot;S&quot;, &quot;i&quot; ∈ &quot;I&quot; } is a subring of &quot;R&quot;,
# The intersection &quot;S&quot; ∩ &quot;I&quot; is an ideal of &quot;S&quot;, and
# The quotient rings (&quot;S&quot; + &quot;I&quot;) / &quot;I&quot; and &quot;S&quot; / (&quot;S&quot; ∩ &quot;I&quot;) are isomorphic.

=== Theorem C (rings)===
Let &quot;R&quot; be a ring, and &quot;I&quot; an ideal of &quot;R&quot;. Then
# If formula_92 is a subring of formula_80 such that formula_94, then formula_95 is a subring of formula_96.
# Every subring of formula_96 is of the form formula_95 for some subring formula_92 of formula_80 such that formula_94.
# If formula_102 is an ideal of formula_80 such that formula_104, then formula_105 is an ideal of formula_96.
# Every ideal of formula_96 is of the form formula_105 for some ideal formula_102 of formula_80 such that formula_104.
# If formula_102 is an ideal of formula_80 such that formula_104, then the quotient ring formula_115 is isomorphic to formula_116.

=== Theorem D (rings)===
Let formula_27 be an ideal of formula_80. The correspondence formula_119 is an inclusion-preserving bijection between the set of subrings formula_92 of formula_80 that contain formula_27 and the set of subrings of formula_96. Furthermore, formula_92 (a subring containing formula_27) is an ideal of formula_80 if and only if formula_95 is an ideal of formula_96.

== Modules ==
The statements of the isomorphism theorems for modules are particularly simple, since it is possible to form a quotient module from any submodule. The isomorphism theorems for vector spaces (modules over a field) and abelian groups (modules over formula_129) are special cases of these. For finite-dimensional vector spaces, all of these theorems follow from the rank–nullity theorem.

In the following, &quot;module&quot; will mean &quot;&quot;R&quot;-module&quot; for some fixed ring &quot;R&quot;.

=== Theorem A (modules) ===
Let &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; be modules, and let &quot;φ&quot; : &quot;M&quot; → &quot;N&quot; be a module homomorphism. Then:
# The kernel of &quot;φ&quot; is a submodule of &quot;M&quot;,
# The image of &quot;φ&quot; is a submodule of &quot;N&quot;, and
# The image of &quot;φ&quot; is isomorphic to the quotient module &quot;M&quot; / ker(&quot;φ&quot;).
In particular, if &quot;φ&quot; is surjective then &quot;N&quot; is isomorphic to &quot;M&quot; / ker(&quot;φ&quot;).

===Theorem B (modules)===
Let &quot;M&quot; be a module, and let &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; be submodules of &quot;M&quot;. Then:
# The sum &quot;S&quot; + &quot;T&quot; = {&quot;s&quot; + &quot;t&quot; | &quot;s&quot; ∈ &quot;S&quot;, &quot;t&quot; ∈ &quot;T&quot;} is a submodule of &quot;M&quot;,
# The intersection &quot;S&quot; ∩ &quot;T&quot; is a submodule of &quot;M&quot;, and
# The quotient modules (&quot;S&quot; + &quot;T&quot;) / &quot;T&quot; and &quot;S&quot; / (&quot;S&quot; ∩ &quot;T&quot;) are isomorphic.

===Theorem C (modules) ===
Let &quot;M&quot; be a module, &quot;T&quot; a submodule of &quot;M&quot;.

# If formula_2 is a submodule of formula_131 such that formula_132, then formula_133 is a submodule of formula_134.
# Every submodule of formula_134 is of the form formula_133 for some submodule formula_2 of formula_131 such that formula_132.
# If formula_2 is a submodule of formula_131 such that formula_132, then the quotient module formula_143 is isomorphic to formula_144.
===Theorem D (modules)===
Let formula_131 be a module, formula_4 a submodule of formula_131. There is a bijection between the submodules of formula_131 that contain formula_4 and the submodules of formula_150. The correspondence is given by formula_151 for all formula_152. This correspondence commutes with the processes of taking sums and intersections (i.e., is a lattice isomorphism between the lattice of submodules of formula_150 and the lattice of submodules of formula_131 that contain formula_4).

== Universal algebra ==
To generalise this to universal algebra, normal subgroups need to be replaced by congruence relations.

A congruence on an algebra formula_92 is an equivalence relation formula_157 that forms a subalgebra of formula_158 considered as an algebra with componentwise operations. One can make the set of equivalence classes formula_159 into an algebra of the same type by defining the operations via representatives; this will be well-defined since formula_160 is a subalgebra of formula_158. The resulting structure is the quotient algebra.

=== Theorem A (universal algebra)===
Let formula_162 be an algebra homomorphism. Then the image of formula_163 is a subalgebra of formula_164, the relation given by formula_165 (i.e. the kernel of formula_163) is a congruence on formula_92, and the algebras formula_159 and formula_169 are isomorphic. (Note that in the case of a group, formula_170 iff formula_171, so one recovers the notion of kernel used in group theory in this case.)

=== Theorem B (universal algebra)===
Given an algebra formula_92, a subalgebra formula_164 of formula_92, and a congruence formula_160 on formula_92, let formula_177 be the trace of formula_160 in formula_164 and formula_180 the collection of equivalence classes that intersect formula_164. Then
# formula_182 is a congruence on formula_164,
# formula_184 is a subalgebra of formula_159, and
# the algebra formula_186 is isomorphic to the algebra formula_187.

=== Theorem C (universal algebra) ===
Let formula_92 be an algebra and formula_189 two congruence relations on formula_92 such that formula_191. Then formula_192 is a congruence on formula_193, and formula_159 is isomorphic to formula_195

=== Theorem D (universal algebra) ===
Let formula_92 be an algebra and denote formula_197 the set of all congruences on formula_92. The set
formula_197 is a complete lattice ordered by inclusion.
If formula_200 is a congruence and we denote by formula_201 the set of all congruences that contain formula_160 (i.e. formula_203 is a principal filter in formula_197, moreover it is a sublattice), then
the map formula_205 is a lattice isomorphism.

<text>Reds is a 1981 American epic historical drama film co-written, produced, and directed by Warren Beatty, about the life and career of John Reed, the journalist and writer who chronicled the October Revolution in Russia in his 1919 book &quot;Ten Days That Shook the World&quot;. Beatty stars in the lead role alongside Diane Keaton as Louise Bryant and Jack Nicholson as Eugene O&#x27;Neill.

The supporting cast includes Edward Herrmann, Jerzy Kosiński, Paul Sorvino, Maureen Stapleton, Gene Hackman, Ramon Bieri, Nicolas Coster, and M. Emmet Walsh. The film also features, as &quot;witnesses&quot;, interviews with the 98-year-old radical educator and peace activist Scott Nearing, author Dorothy Frooks, reporter and author George Seldes, civil liberties advocate Roger Baldwin, and the American writer Henry Miller, among others.

&quot;Reds&quot; was released on December 4, 1981, to widespread critical acclaim. Beatty was awarded the Academy Award for Best Director and the film was nominated for Best Picture, but lost to &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;. Beatty, Keaton, Nicholson, and Stapleton were nominated for Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Supporting Actress, respectively, with Stapleton winning her category. Beatty became the third person to be nominated for Academy Awards in the categories Best Director, Actor, and, with co-writer Trevor Griffiths, Original Screenplay—losing again to &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;—for a film nominated for Best Picture.

In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed &quot;AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10&quot;—the best ten films in ten &quot;classic&quot; American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the film community. &quot;Reds&quot; came in ninth in the epic genre.

==Plot==
In 1915, married journalist and suffragist Louise Bryant encounters the radical journalist John Reed for the first time at a lecture in Portland, Oregon, and is intrigued with his idealism. After meeting him for an interview on international politics that lasts an entire night, she realizes that writing has been her only escape from her frustrated existence. Inspired to leave her husband, Bryant joins Reed in Greenwich Village, New York City, and becomes acquainted with the local community of activists and artists, including anarchist and author Emma Goldman and the playwright Eugene O&#x27;Neill.

Later, they move to Provincetown, Massachusetts, to concentrate on their writing, becoming involved in the local theater scene. Through her writing, Bryant becomes a feminist and radical in her own right. Reed becomes involved in labor strikes with the &quot;Reds&quot; of the Industrial Workers of the World. Obsessed with changing the world, he grows restless and heads for St. Louis to cover the 1916 Democratic National Convention.

During Reed&#x27;s absence, Bryant falls into a complicated affair with O&#x27;Neill. Upon his return, Reed discovers the affair and realizes he still loves Bryant. The two marry secretly and make a home together in Croton-on-Hudson, New York, but still have conflicting desires. When Reed admits his own infidelities, Bryant takes a ship to Europe to work as a war correspondent. After a flare-up of a kidney disorder results in him having one of them removed, Reed is warned to avoid excessive travel or stress, but he decides to take the same path as Louise and goes to Europe. Reunited as professionals, the two find their passion rekindled as they travel to Russia and are swept up in the fall of the Czarist regime and the events of the 1917 Revolution.

After returning to the United States, Reed writes &quot;Ten Days That Shook the World&quot;, while Louise is called to testify in front of the Overman Committee. In order to implement the communist ideals he saw in Russia, Reed becomes active in the Socialist Party of America&#x27;s new Left Wing Section. The Socialist Party soon undergoes a major political shift, with Reed and the Left Wing elected to 12 of its National Executive Committee&#x27;s 15 seats, but the sitting members of the Committee prevent a takeover of the party by invalidating the election and expelling the entire Left Wing. Differing ideology among the expelled members causes them to splinter into two rival organizations, with Reed forming the Communist Labor Party of America. Anxious to establish his group as the United States&#x27; true Communist Party, Reed plans to return to Russia to secure official recognition from the Soviet Comintern. Having grown tired of the political infighting, Bryant threatens to end their relationship if he goes, but he does so anyway, promising to be home by Christmas.

As it was now illegal to travel to Russia, Reed enters the country by traveling to Finland and sneaking across the border. Once there, though, he grows disillusioned with the authoritarian policies the Bolsheviks have imposed upon communist Russia. Reed attempts to leave and return to Bryant, but is imprisoned in Finland after being caught trying to cross the border. After learning of his arrest, Louise seeks the U.S. government&#x27;s help in securing his release, but it refuses, as in his absence he has been indicted on charges of sedition. With no other recourse, Louise illegally travels to Finland herself, but by the time she arrives Reed has been returned to Russia as part of a prisoner exchange between the two countries.

Now living in Petrograd, Reed is employed as a propagandist with the Comintern, and shares an apartment with Emma Goldman, who had been deported from the U.S. Unaware that Louise has traveled to Finland, he repeatedly tries to make contact with her by sending telegrams to New York and becomes increasingly frustrated by the lack of response. Louise makes her way to Petrograd, where she is found by Emma, who tells her Reed was sent to deliver a speech in Baku. On his return to Petrograd, the Czarist White Army attacks Reed&#x27;s train. Reed manages to survive the attack and is reunited with Louise at the train station. Soon thereafter, he is admitted to the hospital with typhus, and Louise cares for him. On his last day, they have loving words for each other. Louise goes down the hall to find him water and returns to find Reed dead. She enters his room, takes his hand, and sits by his bed.

==Cast==
==Production==

===Development===
Beatty came across the story of John Reed in the mid-1960s. Executive producer and film editor Dede Allen remembers Beatty&#x27;s mentioning making a film about Reed&#x27;s life as early as 1966. Originally titled &quot;Comrades&quot;, the first script was written by Beatty in 1969, but the process stalled. In 1973, Beatty was offered the role of Reed in Sergei Bondarchuk&#x27;s Soviet film production &quot;Red Bells&quot;, but declined, and felt further driven to make his own biopic about Reed to compete with the Soviet version.

In 1976, Beatty found a suitable collaborator in Trevor Griffiths, who began work but was delayed by his wife&#x27;s death in a plane crash. The preliminary draft of the script was finished in 1978. Beatty still had problems with it and he and Griffiths spent four and a half months fixing it. Beatty also collaborated with his friends Robert Towne, Peter Feibleman, and Elaine May to continue polishing the script after shooting had begun.

===Financing===
Beatty achieved tremendous success with 1978&#x27;s &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;, which he produced, starred in, co-wrote and co-directed for Paramount Pictures. The success gave Beatty the clout to seek funding for his long nurtured &quot;Reds&quot; project, which was difficult to secure because of the controversial communist subject matter and high price tag. Beatty succeeded in interesting both Warner Bros. and Paramount, before the head of Gulf &amp; Western (Paramount&#x27;s parent company), Charles Bluhdorn, agreed to finance the project. Bluhdorn soon had second thoughts, and attempted to dissuade Beatty with the promise of underwriting a $25 million alternative to &quot;Reds&quot; of Beatty&#x27;s choice, but Beatty remained committed.

===Casting===
Beatty originally had no intention of acting in the film or even directing it because he had learned on projects such as &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; (1967) and &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1978) that producing a film alone is a difficult task. He briefly considered John Lithgow for the part of John Reed because the two were similar in appearance, but eventually Beatty decided to act in the film and direct it himself. Nicholson was cast as Eugene O&#x27;Neill over James Taylor and Sam Shepard. Nicholson was older than the young O&#x27;Neill he was playing, and having just completed work on Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980), was in a &quot;most shambolic&quot; and &quot;grotesque&quot; physical state, according to producer Simon Relph. But Nicholson was committed to the role and appeared at the start of filming four months later having lost the weight he had gained and looking much younger.

Beatty also chose to cast non-actors in supporting roles, including George Plimpton, the editor of &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, who played the character of Horace Whigham. Jerzy Kosiński, a Polish American novelist, was asked to play the role of Grigory Zinoviev, but he initially refused because he was a fierce anti-communist and feared that he might be abducted by the KGB if he went to Finland to film.

====The Witnesses====
To gain perspective on the lives of Reed and Bryant, Beatty filmed interviews with a group of men and women, referred to only as &quot;The Witnesses&quot;, as early as 1971. &quot;American Film&quot; identified the witnesses in its March 1982 issue.

In a capsule review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, film critic Vincent Canby refers to them as &quot;more than two dozen very, very old people, billed only as The Witnesses, whom Mr. Beatty interviewed about the Reeds and their long-gone times.&quot; He went on to say, &quot;More than anything else in &quot;Reds,&quot; these interviews give the film its poignant point of view and separate it from all other romantic adventure films ever made.&quot; &quot;The most evocative aspect of the presentation is a documentary enhancement – interviews with a number of venerable &#x27;witnesses,&#x27; whose recollections of the period help to set the scene, bridge transitions and preserve a touching human perspective&quot;, wrote Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

===Filming===
When principal photography began in August 1979 the original intention was for a 15- to 16-week shoot, but it ultimately took one year. Filming took place in five countries and at various points the crew had to wait for snow to fall in Helsinki (and other parts of Finland), which stood in for the Soviet Union, and for rain to stop in Spain. Beatty asked the Soviet government for a permit to film in Moscow but was denied. A cottage in Kent was used to depict exteriors of the Reeds&#x27; home in Croton-on-Hudson, which in reality was a small early American saltbox house. The interior sets built at Twickenham Studios and EMI-Elstree Studios were also enlarged to evoke the &quot;flavor&quot; of the real home without reproducing it exactly.

Other English locations included Frensham Ponds in Surrey, which stood in for Provincetown, the Smeaton Room of the Institution of Civil Engineers at One Great George Street for the Liberal Club meeting room in Portland, and the interior of Lancaster House for that of the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg. Another round of filming began in 1980 in New York City, Washington D.C., and Los Angeles, including Paramount Studios.

The Italian cinematographer Vittorio Storaro was banned from shooting the scenes shot in the U.S. after he was unable to gain an H-1B visa and because local trade unions blocked him from doing work on the film. The film encountered similar problems with trade unions in the United Kingdom, and had to hire a separate British crew and pay British actors enrolled in Equity at Screen Actors Guild-rate salaries in order to allow American actors to film scenes in the U.K. These trade disputes caused the film to run heavily over budget, but the studio ultimately recouped its costs after financing the film with a low-interest loan from Barclays Bank as part of a tax-shelter plan.

Actress Maureen Stapleton was due to begin shooting her scenes in London in November 1979, but she refused to take a plane because of a fear of flying. Because it was the wrong season for ocean liner travel, the production had to arrange for Stapleton to travel on a tramp steamer, which broke down in the North Atlantic and had to be towed to Amsterdam. This caused another unwelcome delay. Beatty would also not stop the camera between takes, letting it roll continuously, and insisted on a large number of takes. Paul Sorvino said he did as many as 70 takes for one scene; Stapleton had to do 80 takes of one scene, which caused her to say to Beatty, &quot;Are you out of your fucking mind?&quot;

Beatty and Keaton&#x27;s romantic relationship also began to deteriorate during filming. Peter Biskind wrote about the making of &quot;Reds&quot;, &quot;Beatty&#x27;s relationship with Keaton barely survived the shoot. It is always a dicey proposition when an actress works with a star or director—both, in this case—with whom she has an offscreen relationship. Keaton appeared in more scenes than any other actor save Beatty, and many of them were difficult ones, where she had to assay a wide range of feelings, from romantic passion to anger, and deliver several lengthy, complex, emotional speeches.&quot; George Plimpton once observed, &quot;Diane almost got broken. I thought [Beatty] was trying to break her into what Louise Bryant had been like with John Reed.&quot; Executive producer Simon Relph adds, &quot;It must have been a strain on their relationship because he was completely obsessive, relentless.&quot;

===Post-production===
The editing process began in early 1980, with as many as 65 people working on editing down and going over approximately 2.5 million feet of film. Post-production ended in November 1981, more than two years after the start of filming. Paramount stated that the final cost of the film was $32 million, the rough equivalent of $80 million in 2007 and $122 million in 2024.

===Music===
The film introduced the song &quot;Goodbye for Now&quot;, written by Stephen Sondheim, recorded by Jean-Pierre Rampal and Claude Bolling. The song was later recorded by Barbra Streisand for &quot;The Movie Album&quot; (2003).

==Reception==
Released on December 4, 1981, &quot;Reds&quot; opened to widespread critical acclaim. Despite its political subject matter and limited promotion by Beatty, the film became the 13th-highest-grossing picture of 1981, grossing $40 million in U.S. box office revenues, a figure that does not include the film&#x27;s foreign box office revenues or its substantial subsequent earnings in home video, worldwide broadcast and cable television, and subscription television and streaming services. Beatty later remarked that the film &quot;made a little money&quot; in box office returns. During the film&#x27;s second and third weekends, there were concerns that it would become a massive flop like &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;, but it performed more strongly over the next month. The film was screened at the White House for President Ronald Reagan.

&quot;Reds&quot; holds a 90% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes based on 49 reviews, with an average rating of 7.90/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;Brawny in both intellect and scope, &quot;Reds&quot; is an intimate epic that captures the tumult of revolutionary change and the passion of those navigating through it.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 76 out of 100 based on 15 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

John Simon of the &quot;National Review&quot; wrote, &quot;Never exactly boring, sometimes entertaining, &quot;Reds&quot; is frequently irritating and finally disappointing&quot;. &quot;Commentary&quot; published a largely negative review by Richard Grenier, who, among other things, saw the film as deliberately obscuring the protagonists&#x27; communist politics and as exaggerating Bryant&#x27;s talent and accomplishments. Conversely, in a retrospective article for &quot;Jacobin&quot;, Jim Poe called &quot;Reds&quot; &quot;one of the greatest and most faithful depictions of revolutionary politics&quot;, praising its &quot;light touch and brisk storytelling&quot; for an epic, as well as its cinematography, shifts in mood and performances, in particular those of Keaton and Beatty.

==Awards and nominations==
The film is recognized by the American Film Institute in these lists:
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions – #55
* AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 – #9 Epic Film

<text>A chacmool (also spelled chac-mool or Chac Mool) is a form of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican sculpture depicting a reclining figure with its head facing 90 degrees from the front, supporting itself on its elbows and supporting a bowl or a disk upon its stomach. These figures possibly symbolised slain warriors carrying offerings to the gods; the bowl upon the chest was used to hold sacrificial offerings, including pulque, tamales, tortillas, tobacco, turkeys, feathers, and incense. In Aztec examples, the receptacle is a cuauhxicalli (a stone bowl to receive sacrificed human hearts). Chacmools were often associated with sacrificial stones or thrones. The chacmool form of sculpture first appeared around the 9th century AD in the Valley of Mexico and the northern Yucatán Peninsula.

Aztec chacmools bore water imagery and were associated with Tlaloc, the rain god. Their symbolism placed them on the frontier between the physical and supernatural realms, as intermediaries with the gods. 

==Form==
The chacmool is a distinctive form of Mesoamerican sculpture representing a reclining figure with its head facing 90 degrees from the front, leaning on its elbows and supporting a bowl or a disk upon its chest. There is great variation among individual chacmools, with some possessing heads that are right-facing and others left-facing, and some with the heads facing upwards; some examples have movable heads. The figure may be lying on its back or on its side and the abdomen can be sunken below the level of the chest and knees or at the same level. Some chacmools were raised upon rectangular bases. Some of the figures are richly attired whilst others are almost naked.

The chacmools of Chichen Itza and Tula depict young men with warrior attributes, while the chacmools of Michoacán depict elderly men with wrinkled faces and erect penises. A chacmool from Guácimo, Costa Rica, combines human and jaguar features and grips a bowl. The face of the figure looks upwards and the bowl was apparently used to grind foodstuffs.

A wide variety of materials were used to sculpt chacmools, including limestone and hard metamorphic and igneous rock types. Other materials employed include ceramic and cement.

==Discovery and naming==

The ancient name for these type of sculptures is unknown. The term &quot;chacmool&quot; is derived from the name &quot;Chaacmol,&quot; which Augustus Le Plongeon in 1875 gave to a sculpture that he and his wife Alice Dixon Le Plongeon excavated within the Temple of the Eagles and Jaguars at Chichén Itzá in 1875; he translated &quot;Chaacmol&quot; from Yucatecan Mayan as the &quot;paw swift like thunder.&quot; Le Plongeon believed the statue, which he had found buried beneath the Platform of the Eagles and the Jaguars, depicted a former ruler of Chichen Itza. Le Plongeon&#x27;s sponsor, Stephen Salisbury of Worcester, Massachusetts, published Le Plongeon&#x27;s find, but revised the spelling to &quot;Chac-Mool.&quot;

Le Plongeon sought permission from Mexico&#x27;s president to display the statue at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876, a request that was denied. In 1877 the Yucatecan government seized the statue and brought it to Mérida. Weeks later Yucatán turned over the statue to the federal government, which brought it to Mexico City to the National Museum of Anthropology. Museum worker Jesús Sanchez realised that the Chichen Itza sculpture was stylistically similar to two sculptures from central Mexico and the wide occurrence of the form within Mesoamerica was first recognised. The 19th century discovery of chacmools in both central Mexico and the Yucatán Peninsula helped to promote the idea of a Toltec empire although the chacmool sculptures may have originated in the Maya region.

Although the name &quot;chacmool&quot; was inappropriately applied, it has become a useful label to link stylistically similar sculptures from different regions and periods without imposing a unified interpretation. Besides these sites, the sculpture was also found in Michoacán, where it is called Uaxanoti (The Seated One) in the Purépecha language.

==Distribution==

Examples of chacmool sculptures have been found widely across Mesoamerica from Michoacán in Mexico down to El Salvador. The earliest examples date from the Terminal Classic period of Mesoamerican chronology (c. AD 800–900). Examples are known from the Postclassic Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, from the central Mexican city of Tula and from the Maya city of Chichen Itza in the Yucatán Peninsula. Fourteen chacmools are known from Chichen Itza and twelve from Tula. The chacmool from the palace at Tula is dated to the Early Postclassic (c. AD 900–1200). Further examples are known from Acolman, Cempoala, Michoacán, Querétaro and Tlaxcala.

In Chichen Itza, only five of the fourteen chacmools were securely confirmed in architectural contexts, those in the Castillo, the Chacmool Temple, the North Colonnade, the Temple of the Little Tables and the Temple of the Warriors. The rest were found interred in or near important structures. The five that were found in secure architectural contexts were all placed within entrance areas near a ritual seat or throne. The chacmools in Tula also had an association with thrones or raised seating platforms, either in front of the throne or at the entrance to a chamber containing a throne.

Two chacmools have been recovered that were associated with the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital. The first was discovered in 1943, on the junction of Venustiano Carranza and Pino Suarez, about two blocks south of the temple itself. The second chacmool was excavated in the sacred precinct. This is the only fully polychrome chacmool that has been recovered anywhere; it had an open mouth and exposed teeth and stood in front of the temple of Tlaloc, the Aztec rain god; its sculpted bowl probably received heart and blood sacrifices. This latter sculpture is by far the older of the two.

Chacmools have been reported as far south as the Maya city of Quiriguá, near the Guatemalan border with Honduras. The Quiriguá chacmool most likely dated to the Postclassic period and is stylistically similar to those of Tula rather than Chichen Itza. Two chacmools were reported from Tazumal, a Maya site in western El Salvador. A chacmool was excavated at Las Mercedes in Guácimo, Costa Rica.

==Dating and origin==
The oldest chacmool ever discovered was the Terminal Classic. The form was unknown in such important Mesoamerican cities as Teotihuacan and Tikal. After the first appearance of the form, it was rapidly disseminated throughout Mesoamerica, spreading as far south as Costa Rica. Although a central Mexican origin is generally assumed, there are no antecedents pre-dating the Toltecs and the form is not present in central Mexican codices.

The positioning and context of the chacmool form do have antecedents in Classic Maya art and art historian Mary Ellen Miller has argued that the chacmool developed out of Classic period Maya imagery. No central Mexican chacmool has been found that clearly predates the Chichen Itza examples. However, Tula and Chichen Itza may have developed simultaneously with rapid communication of the chacmool form from one city to the other.

The wider variety of chacmool forms at Chichen Itza has also been used to support the development of the form there; no two possess identical form, dress and proportions. At Tula the chacmools have a standardised form with little variation in position or proportions. Miller has proposed that the chacmool developed out of Classic Maya iconography and underwent a transition into three dimensional sculpture at Chichen Itza, perhaps spurred by the influence of central Mexican sculptural forms. A chacmool from Costa Rica was dated by the excavators to approximately AD 1000.

== Aztec Chacmool ==
During the 1930 excavation of Templo Mayor, the only fully polychrome chacmool to be found at that site was in its original context on the top level of the Tlaloc side (the rain god) of the temple. The position of this chacmool statue mirrored the position of the sacrificial stone on the Huitzilopochtli (the Aztecs&#x27; patron deity, associated with war) side of the temple. Archaeologist Eduardo Matos Moctezuma posits that this mirroring confirms his interpretation that the chacmool acted as an &quot;intermediary between the priest and the god, a divine messenger,&quot; in the same way the sacrificial stone on the Huitzilopochtli side does. 

The pigment that remained on this chacmool sculpture was crucial to its identification, as it does not contain any sculpted iconography or symbols associated with the rain god Tlaloc. Archaeologists were able to create a reconstruction of the sculpture&#x27;s original colors, which they then compared to pictographic representations of Tlaloc. This comparison confirmed that the polychrome chacmool discovered at Tlaloc&#x27;s side of the Templo Mayor was a representation of the deity itself. Characteristics such as the &quot;&quot;chia&quot; circles on the cheeks, the circular gold pectoral medallion, and the color combination of the petticoat, as well as the black skin, the red hands and feet, and the white headdress and bangles&quot; echo the iconography of other depictions of Tlaloc. Art historians Leonardo Lopez Lujan and Giacomo Chiari argue that this &quot;confirms that there is symbolic continuity between the early and late Mexica [Aztec] chacmool,&quot; due to early Aztec chacmools containing iconographic nods to Tlaloc.

A second chacmool discovery from the Templo Mayor, dating to a later period, displays iconographic features which are distinct from the larger corpus of chacmool figures but consistent with other sculptures (Tlaloc ritual vessels and bench reliefs) found in a similar context at the Templo Mayor. Whereas Tlaloc&#x27;s eyes are generally represented with a round goggle-like frame, the later chacmool, the vessels, and the bench relief feature a rectangular eye frame within which almond eyes are engraved. All three sculptures also include large fangs at the corners of the god&#x27;s mouth. The ornaments worn by the later chacmool and included in the vessels and the bench relief also differ from other representations of Tlaloc. The later chacmool, vessels, and bench relief sport oversized circular earspools, rather than the characteristic earspools with a square plug and central dangal; they are also adorned with a multistrand, beaded collar in which one strand has larger beads that have been interpreted to be hanging bells. The chacmool holds onto a &quot;cuauhxicalli&quot; vessel that is engraved with the face of Tlaloc, including the same rectangular eye and mouth features.
In 1942, archaeologists recovered another chacmool example located a few blocks away from the Templo Mayor. This chacmool has overt iconographic associations with Tlaloc, wearing his mask and holding a &quot;cuauhxicalli&quot; vessel whose top is carved with the face of Tlaloc (rather than being concave and able to hold something). He is wearing several strands of beaded necklaces, with the outer most ring containing oliva shells, which were a characteristic of Maya costuming. Another Maya influence can be seen in his headdress, which scholars Mary Miller and Marco Samayoa compare to a headdress worn by Maya king Shield Jaguar (also known as Itzamnaaj Bahlam III) of Yaxchilan. Perhaps the most interesting iconographic feature of this chacmool, however, is the large necklace pendant he wears, which Miller and Samayoa argue is a representation of an actual heirloom pendant. They suggest that the pendant was looted from a Maya site, probably &quot;from a stone vessel interred behind a chacmool&quot; and that &quot;its subject is probably the enthroned, resurrected Maize God.&quot; This association between chacmools and maize deities is rooted in Maya examples (from which the Aztecs were clearly drawing inspiration, as this example&#x27;s headdress and shell necklace demonstrate), but does not necessarily mean that the Aztecs would have associated their chacmools with maize deities. In all likelihood, the Aztecs conceived of chacmools as being connected to Tlaloc, as it is his image and associated iconographic characteristics that cover the majority of discovered Aztec chacmools. This chacmool, for instance, features a carving of Tlaloc on its underside, the symbolic meaning of which Miller explores: &quot;With their undersides carved with aquatic symbols, these sculptures seem to float on water. This suspension suggests the liminal qualities of the messenger, the link between earth and supernaturals.&quot; 

==Interpretations==

The meaning of the chacmool figures varied across time depending upon the geographical and cultural context. Chacmools do not appear to have been worshipped, since they are never found within inner sanctuary of temples or shrines; it appears to have rather been a piece of religious paraphernalia used by the priesthood in the course of their duties. Three uses have generally been attributed to chacmools.

The first interpretation is that the chacmool is an offering table (or &quot;tlamanalco&quot;) to receive gifts such as pulque, tamales, tortillas, tobacco, turkeys, feathers and incense. The second is that the chacmool was a &quot;cuauhxicalli&quot; to receive blood and human hearts; this use is particularly relevant to the Aztecs, who used a &quot;cuauhxicalli&quot; bowl in place of the usual disc-altar. These bowls may have accepted these blood offerings directly or may have been holders for portable &quot;cuauhxicalli&quot; bowls that were placed within them. A chacmool from Tlaxcala has a bloodied heart sculpted on the underside, supporting this interpretation.

It has also been suggested that chacmools were used as a &quot;techcatl&quot;, or sacrificial stone over which victims were stretched so their hearts could be cut from their chests. The &quot;Crónica Mexicayotl&quot; describes such a sacrificial stone as sculpted in the form of a person with a twisted head. &quot;Techcatl&quot; were not just used for human sacrifice, they were also used in the &quot;yacaxapotlaliztli&quot; ceremony, where the nose of a future ruler was pierced. Such rituals may also have been executed upon chacmools, and the presence of small nose jewels sculpted onto various chacmools at Chichen Itza and one at Tula has been used to support this idea.

The backward reclining figure of the chacmool presents a defenceless, passive appearance and has been likened by Miller to the positioning of captives in Classic period Maya sculpture and painting. Bent elbows and knees are common in depictions of Maya captives; the full-frontal view of the face is rare in Maya art except among representations of captives. The form of the Chichen Itza chacmools lacks the typical traits of Maya deities and most scholars have assumed that the iconography of Maya chacmools is equivalent to that of the central Mexican examples. Eduard Seler commented in the early 1960s that chacmools in Chichen Itza tended to be located in temple antechambers, where the bowl or disc gripped by the figure served to receive pulque as an offering.

The chacmools at Chichen Itza were found in a combination of chacmool, throne and serpent column; this chacmool-throne-serpent complex was associated with rulership during the Early Postclassic period. The original chacmool described by Le Plongeon in the 19th century included small images of the central Mexican deity Tlaloc on its ear ornaments. Among the Classic period Maya, such Tlaloc imagery was associated with war and human sacrifice. Associations between the rain god, war and human sacrifice may have continued into the Postclassic period as demonstrated by the chacmool within the Castillo at Chichen Itza, which bears small images of the Maya rain god Chaac on its ear ornaments. The chacmools at Tula, with contextual similarity to those at Chichen Itza, probably also represent war captives.

The lack of the representation of chacmools in Central Mexican codices has led to them being associated with a great variety of deities by scholars, including Cinteotl, Tezcatzoncatl and Tlaloc. Both of the chacmools from the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan were clearly associated with Tlaloc. The chacmool found two blocks south of the temple was sculpted with three images of the deity. These included an elaborate relief image of Tlaloc amongst aquatic symbols on the underside, one on the bowl that the figure grips and the last is the Tlaloc mask with characteristic goggles and fangs that is worn by the chacmool.

The fully polychrome chacmool found &quot;in situ&quot; in the Great Temple was associated with Tlaloc by its placement on the Tlaloc half of the double pyramid. A further Aztec chacmool was described in the 19th century; it is of uncertain origin but stylistically it is typical of Tenochtitlan. It is sculpted on the underside with aquatic imagery and the figure wears a goggle-and-fangs Tlaloc mask. Spanish observers reported the great quantity of human sacrifices during important ceremonies at the Great Temple and the chacmool was probably used during these rituals to symbolise the sacrificed captives as well as receive their blood.

The discs gripped by some chacmools may represent a mirror. Chacmools were placed in entrances in order to receive sacrificial offerings, including human blood and hearts. The aquatic imagery carved onto the underside of some of the figures symbolised that they were floating on water, on the frontier between the physical world and the supernatural realm. This suggests that chacmools acted as messengers between the mortal realm and that of the gods.

Costa Rican chacmools gripped sculpted bowls; these chacmools also served ceremonial purposes although the bowl was used to grind foodstuffs.

==In contemporary culture==
The short story &quot;Chac Mool&quot; by Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes is found in his book &quot;Los días enmascarados&quot; (), published in 1954. A man named Filiberto buys a chacmool for his art collection, and discovers that the stone is slowly becoming flesh. The idol eventually becomes fully human, dominating his life, causing flooding and other disasters. Filiberto dies by drowning. His story is found in a diary describing the terrors brought on by the idol, and his plans to escape. According to the author, this short story was inspired by news reports from 1952 when the lending of a representation of the Maya rain deity to a Mexican exhibition in Europe had coincided with wet weather there. The short story was included in the 2008 anthology &quot;Sun, Stone, and Shadows.&quot;
In Henry Moore&#x27;s early examples of monumental reclining figures, the artist relied on the cast of a chacmool sculpture he saw in Paris. Commenting on the major impact chacmool sculpted figures had on his early career, Moore stated that &quot;Its stillness and alertness, a sense of readiness – and the whole presence of it, and the legs coming down like columns&quot; were characteristics that inspired his creations.

<doc id="45246" wikidata="Q80304" url="?curid=45246" title="Korn">
<text>Korn (stylized as KoЯn) is an American nu metal band from Bakersfield, California, originally formed in 1993 by James &quot;Munky&quot; Shaffer, Reginald &quot;Fieldy&quot; Arvizu and David Silveria, who were members of the band L.A.P.D. Their current lineup features Shaffer (guitar), Arvizu (bass), Brian &quot;Head&quot; Welch (guitar), Jonathan Davis (vocals), and Ray Luzier (drums), the last of whom replaced Silveria in 2007. The band is notable for pioneering and popularizing the nu metal genre.

Korn made a demo tape, &quot;Neidermayer&#x27;s Mind&quot;, in 1993, which was distributed free to record companies and on request to members of the public. Their debut album &quot;Korn&quot; was released in 1994, followed by their commercial breakthrough, &quot;Life Is Peachy&quot;, in 1996. The band first experienced mainstream success with &quot;Follow the Leader&quot; (1998) and &quot;Issues&quot; (1999), both of which debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The band&#x27;s mainstream success continued with &quot;Untouchables&quot; (2002); &quot;Take a Look in the Mirror&quot; (2003); and &quot;See You on the Other Side&quot; (2005).

A compilation album, &quot;Greatest Hits Vol. 1&quot;, was released in 2004, spanning a decade of singles and concluding the band&#x27;s recording contract with Immortal Records and Epic Records. They signed to Virgin Records, releasing &quot;See You on the Other Side&quot; in 2005, and an untitled album in 2007. The band&#x27;s other recent albums, &quot;Korn III: Remember Who You Are&quot; (2010) and &quot;The Path of Totality&quot; (2011), were released via Roadrunner Records, with &quot;The Paradigm Shift&quot; (2013) being released via Prospect Park and Caroline Records. &quot;The Serenity of Suffering&quot; (2016) saw their return to Roadrunner Records, through which &quot;The Nothing&quot; was released on September 13, 2019. Their latest album, &quot;Requiem&quot;, was released via Loma Vista Recordings on February 4, 2022.

As of 2021, Korn had sold more than 40 million records worldwide. Several of their releases have been certified gold, platinum or multi-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Fourteen of the band&#x27;s official releases have peaked in the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, eight of which have peaked in the top five. Korn has earned two Grammy Awards out of eight nominations and two MTV Video Music Awards out of 11 nominations. Several of their music videos received substantial play on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot;, and were among the first to be retired on the show, including &quot;Got the Life&quot; and &quot;Freak on a Leash&quot;.

== History ==
=== Early years and formation (1989–1993) ===
Before Korn was formed, three of the original members of the band were associated with the band L.A.P.D.–James Shaffer, Reginald Arvizu, and David Silveria. 
The group originally consisted of Shaffer, Arvizu, and lead vocalist Richard Morrill; Silveria joined when he was 16. When the band moved from Bakersfield, California to Los Angeles, Silveria dropped out of high school and Shaffer stayed in Bakersfield. When Shaffer reunited with the band, they found a manager and released an EP entitled &quot;Love and Peace Dude&quot; in 1989 through Triple X Records. L.A.P.D. released their sole full-length studio album &quot;Who&#x27;s Laughing Now&quot; on May 3, 1991. After the album&#x27;s release, Morrill departed from the ensemble. The remaining trio were also briefly known as Creep, recording a demo with a singer named Corey before enlisting Brian Welch and Jonathan Davis to form the band that went on to become Korn.
When thinking of a band name, someone suggested &quot;corn&quot;, but the band rejected that name, so Shaffer had the idea to spell the name with a &quot;K&quot; instead of a &quot;C&quot;, and a backwards &quot;R&quot;, so the band&#x27;s name would appear as &quot;KoЯn&quot;. The idea of using a backwards &quot;R&quot; came from the logo of toy retailer Toys R Us, for which many of the band members had previously worked. Silveria explained the logo, designed by Davis, &quot;the music makes the name, because Korn&#x27;s a dumb name. But once we get established, it makes the name cool.&quot;

Korn rented a studio from Jeff Creath called Underground Chicken Sound, in Huntington Beach, California. While they were recording there, a crowd had been loitering outside the studio. The band began playing a prelude to a later song &quot;Clown&quot;, attracting a larger crowd. Arvizu said the crowd gathered because it sounded so &quot;different.&quot; Korn started performing at gigs in the summer of 1993, with members saying that touring was a &quot;pain-in-the-ass.&quot; While in Huntington Beach, the band was spotted by Immortal Records A&amp;R employee Paul Pontius. Pontius would describe Korn&#x27;s sound as &quot;the new genre of rock.&quot; In 1993, Korn released their first demo album, &quot;Neidermayer&#x27;s Mind,&quot; which had very limited printing. It was not well received by critics or the public. It was released to record companies and to people who filled out a flyer given out at gigs they played for free with Biohazard and House of Pain. With this demo, Korn pioneered the nu metal sound, riffs, and rhythm.

=== &quot;Korn&quot; (1994–1996) ===
By May 1994, Korn began recording their self-titled debut album with Ross Robinson. Recording was finished by the end of the following month, and on October 11, the band&#x27;s debut album was released through Immortal Records (an Epic imprint label); it peaked at number one on the BillboardHeatseekers Albums chart and would eventually reach number 72 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in February 1996. The album received positive reviews by critics, and is said to have established the new wave of metal. As well as sparking the nu metal genre, it also started record producer Ross Robinson&#x27;s music career and influenced bands such as Slipknot, Coal Chamber, and Limp Bizkit.

After the band finished recording the album, they began touring with Biohazard and House of Pain. Their record company gave them enough money for their own tour bus. Korn&#x27;s first gig was in Atlanta. About halfway through the tour, the bus that Korn&#x27;s record company gave them stopped working, and the band had to find a new one. Their first tour was not very successful in promoting the album.

Korn went on tour with hardcore punk band Sick of It All in January 1995. The band embarked on their first European tour, including at LA2 in London and L&#x27;Arapaho in Paris. Later that year, Korn was chosen alongside Deftones as direct support for Ozzy Osbourne. Korn&#x27;s self-titled album went gold in the midst of the tour and was eventually certified two-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Aside from touring, Korn released four singles. &quot;Blind&quot; was released on August 1, 1994, and &quot;Shoots and Ladders&quot; was released on October 31, 1995. The latter received a Grammy nomination in 1997 for Best Metal Performance. &quot;Need To&quot; was also released in 1995, on April 8. The fourth and final single, &quot;Clown&quot;, was released on February 2, 1996. &quot;Blind&quot; was the only single to chart, peaking at number 15 on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; Alternative 30.

=== &quot;Life Is Peachy&quot; (1996–1997) ===
After the success of their debut, Korn decided to enter the studio again for a second album. By then, the band had created a large fan base, having played between 200 and 250 shows, and the expectations for their follow-up album were high. They went back into the studio in early April 1996 at Indigo Ranch Studios, Malibu, California.

&quot;Life Is Peachy&quot; was released October 15, 1996 and despite minimal radio airplay and television attention, the album debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and peaked at number one in New Zealand. The album sold 106,000 copies in its first week. Jon Pareles from &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that the band was &quot;mad at everybody, including themselves.&quot; The album was certified double platinum in the United States, platinum in Australia, and gold in Canada.

The first single, &quot;No Place to Hide&quot;, spawned a Grammy nomination for Best Metal Performance. &quot;A.D.I.D.A.S.&quot; was released as the second single on March 4, 1997. It became the band&#x27;s first charting single on &quot;Billboard&quot;, peaking at number 13 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. The third single, &quot;Good God&quot;, was released on July 14, 1997. A promotional disc was released in 1997 to promote both the band and the Life Is Peachy Tour featuring Incubus and the Urge and included three live tracks.
Korn gained more popularity after co-headlining the Lollapalooza summer tour festival in 1997 with Tool. However, Korn was forced to stop touring after Shaffer was diagnosed with viral meningitis. The band remained relatively quiet during the end of the year, resting and setting new goals. The band then founded their own label, Elementree Records, to sign and introduce new bands to their fans. The label was run by Davis who first signed Orgy. Silveria influenced Davis to sign them.

Prior to the release of 1998&#x27;s &quot;Follow the Leader&quot;, Gretchen Plewes, a Zeeland, Michigan high school assistant principal, said in an interview for a Michigan newspaper that Korn&#x27;s music is &quot;indecent, vulgar, obscene and intends to be insulting&quot; after giving a student named Eric VanHoven a one-day suspension for wearing a shirt with the Korn logo. FM station WKLQ was filmed giving away hundreds of free Korn T-shirts, donated by the band outside the school. Ottawa County policemen also helped hand out shirts. Korn filed a cease and desist order against Plewes and the school district for their comments. They also threatened a multimillion-dollar lawsuit, but dropped both actions due to the band members&#x27; personal lives. The period from 1993 to 1997 was embodied by wearing apparel that contained Adidas clothing brand.

=== &quot;Follow the Leader&quot; (1998–1999) ===
In 1998, Korn signed a publishing contract with Warner Chappell Music. While Korn was waiting for a full partnership with Adidas (which had previously sponsored Run-DMC), the sportwear brand refused to sign a contract with Korn. In a contradictory argument, Adidas told them: &quot;We do sports, not music&quot;. In 1998, Puma seized the opportunity and offered a $500,000 deal to Korn, including their music featured in Kevin Kerslake-directed advertisements. Korn accepted the contract; Davis said, &quot;That&#x27;s more than Adidas ever did for us! It wasn&#x27;t a sell-out thing. It was about respect.&quot;

Prior to the release of the band&#x27;s third album, Korn produced a weekly online TV show called &quot;KornTV,&quot; which documented the making of the record and featured special guests such as porn star Ron Jeremy, Limp Bizkit, and 311. The project also gave fans (nicknamed &quot;nibletz&quot;) the chance to call in and ask the band questions, an approach that represented one of the first times a band utilized the Internet in such a way. Korn released their third album &quot;Follow the Leader&quot; on August 18, 1998, which featured a number of guest vocalists such as Ice Cube; Pharcyde member Tre Hardson; Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit; and actor Cheech Marin on the hidden track &quot;Earache My Eye&quot; (written by Marin himself).
Korn launched a political campaign-styled tour to promote &quot;Follow the Leader&quot;’s release, which took the group on a chartered jet all over North America. Band members talked to fans and answered questions during special &quot;fan conferences&quot; organized at every stop along the tour and signed autographs. Jim Rose of the Jim Rose Circus hosted the entire &quot;Kampaign&quot; tour.

The album was considered a complete success by the band, debuting at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with at least 268,000 copies sold in its first week of release and, among other singles, spawning two of their biggest singles: &quot;Got the Life&quot; and &quot;Freak on a Leash&quot;. They both exposed Korn to a wider mainstream audience, with the music videos being mainstays on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot;. &quot;Got the Life&quot; was the show&#x27;s very first &quot;retired&quot; video, with &quot;Freak on a Leash&quot; also reaching retirement several months later. In September 1998, Korn signed with a second music publisher, Zomba Music Group, through negotiations of the band&#x27;s then-manager Jeff Kwatinetz (the former CEO of The Firm), along with co-founders Peter Katsis and Michael Green.

&quot;Freak on a Leash&quot; won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form, and received a nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. The video also earned nine MTV Video Music Awards nominations for Video of the Year; Best Rock Video; Breakthrough Video; Best Direction; Best Special Effects; Best Art Direction; Best Cinematography; Best Editing; and Viewer&#x27;s Choice. It eventually won two awards for Best Rock Video and for Best Editing. &quot;Freak on a Leash&quot; failed to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, although it did manage to peak at number six on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. &quot;Follow the Leader&quot; is considered by members of Korn to be the band&#x27;s most commercially–successful album, being certified five-times platinum by the RIAA and having sold almost 10 million copies worldwide.

===&quot;Issues&quot; (1999–2001)===
The band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Issues&quot;, produced by Brendan O&#x27;Brien, was released on November 16, 1999, featuring cover art designed by Alfredo Carlos, who won an MTV contest held for the fans. &quot;Issues&quot; was released during a week of many highly anticipated records. It debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with at least 573,000 copies sold, keeping Dr. Dre&#x27;s second album &quot;2001&quot; and &quot;All the Way... A Decade of Song&quot; by Céline Dion from hitting number one.

To celebrate the album&#x27;s release, the band performed the record in its entirety in front of a live audience at New York&#x27;s historic Apollo Theater and broadcast the concert simultaneously across many radio stations. This performance marked the first performance by a rock band since Buddy Holly in the late 1950s. This special event featured the New York Police Department marching drum and bagpipe band conducted by Richard Gibbs, as well as a group of backup singers to enhance the more melodic choruses Davis used on the album. A snippet of &quot;Falling Away from Me&quot; was featured on RealVideo with a brief interpretive dance by bassist Reginald Arvizu, and also featured on their official website as an MP3 file, although its release was against the advice of its attorneys and the corporate establishment. The album was also promoted by the band&#x27;s highly successful Sick and Twisted Tour.

A little before Korn&#x27;s album &quot;Issues&quot; was released, the band appeared on an episode of &quot;South Park&quot; titled &quot;Korn&#x27;s Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery&quot;, in which the first single from &quot;Issues&quot;, &quot;Falling Away from Me&quot;, was premiered. The single became Korn&#x27;s first entry on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, reaching number 99. &quot;Make Me Bad&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single in February 2000, peaking at number 14 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. A third single, &quot;Somebody Someone&quot;, followed with more moderate success.

Music videos were filmed for all three singles, with long-time friend Fred Durst directing &quot;Falling Away from Me&quot; and Martin Weisz directing a concept video for &quot;Make Me Bad&quot;, as well as a performance-based video for &quot;Somebody Someone&quot;, which featured CGI effects. Every video was a staple on &quot;Total Request Live&quot;, two of which made it to retirement. &quot;Issues&quot; was described by Stephen Thomas Erlewine to be less hip hop-oriented than &quot;Follow the Leader&quot;. It was certified three-times Platinum, following up the success of &quot;Follow the Leader&quot;. In 2001, the brand PONY reappeared in the clothing industry and initiated a partnership with Korn.

=== &quot;Untouchables&quot; (2002–2003) ===

On June 11, 2002, Korn re-emerged into the media with their fifth album &quot;Untouchables&quot;. It debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 434,000 in sales. The band has blamed music piracy for the drop in sales, as an unmastered version of the album had leaked three months prior to its official release date. On April 2, 2002, the Opie and Anthony Show began airing songs from &quot;Untouchables&quot;. After playing a few songs, the broadcasters received a cease-and-desist letter from Sony Music Entertainment. Opie and Anthony said &quot;The reason for the premature premiere was to infuriate a rival New York station, which disallows their in-studio guests to appear on &#x27;The Opie and Anthony Show.&#x27;&quot; The release of this album was preceded by a show at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York a day prior to the album&#x27;s release broadcast digitally throughout movie theatres in the United States.

The album contained experiments and styles never previously attempted by Korn. AllMusic related: &quot;The band is far more experimental this time out, delivering Helmet-like ringing guitars that melt and morph into each other, a mix of Metallica-esque blastbeats and tight funk drumming from the constantly improving David Silveria, and memorable riffs that take the shape of dark sound structures and offer more than just a collection of chords.&quot; The first two music videos from &quot;Untouchables&quot;, &quot;Here to Stay&quot; and &quot;Thoughtless&quot;, were directed by the Hughes Brothers. &quot;Here to Stay&quot; earned Korn a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance. &quot;Here to Stay&quot; peaked at number 72 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. During an interview with Wall of Sound, Munky revealed the album was the band&#x27;s most expensive to make, but it produced several of his favourite songs, including &quot;Thoughtless&quot; and &quot;Here To Stay&quot;.

=== &quot;Take a Look in the Mirror&quot; and Welch&#x27;s departure (2003–2005) ===
Due to the album &quot;Untouchables&quot; leaking onto the Internet, &quot;Take a Look in the Mirror&quot; was released on Friday November 21, 2003– four days earlier than its original release date. The album therefore received a weekend&#x27;s worth of sales, which resulted in a poor showing on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. During its first full week, &quot;Take a Look in the Mirror&quot; soared ten places from number 19 to number 9, increasing the album&#x27;s total sales to 179,000.

It is the first album self-produced by Korn. The band explained that they wanted fans to hear the music as it should be. The album presented different styles and themes compared to previous albums. Lead vocalist Jonathan Davis related: &quot;The whole album is about love, hate and my hate of people and just losing my mind. The previous albums I did, I think the last three, I was coming from a place of hurt. And I just finally got to the point where I&#x27;m done hurting and I&#x27;m just pissed off about it now. It&#x27;s turned back to just sheer hate and anger. And it definitely comes across on the album.&quot; MTV News said that Davis convinced his fans that they &quot;will be shocked, particularly with the album&#x27;s second track, &#x27;Break Some Off,&#x27; which he called &#x27;brutal&#x27;.&quot;

Korn released the single &quot;Did My Time&quot; on July 22, 2003, which was used to promote the film &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life&quot; but did not appear on its soundtrack due to unspecified legal issues. The single debuted and peaked at number 38 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming Korn&#x27;s first and only top 40 hit in the United States. &quot;Did My Time&quot; gave Korn another Grammy nomination in the Best Metal Performance category.

Korn released their greatest hits album, &quot;Greatest Hits Vol. 1&quot;, on October 5, 2004. The album debuted at number four on &quot;Billboard&quot;, selling more than 129,000 copies. This album assembles choice tracks from six Korn studio albums released between 1994 and 2003. The first single was a cover of the song &quot;Word Up!&quot; originally composed by Cameo. The single peaked at number 23 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. Special editions of &quot;Greatest Hits Vol. 1&quot; included a DVD titled &quot;Korn: Live at CBGB,&quot; featuring seven select songs from their show of November 24, 2003 at CBGB.

In early 2005, Brian Welch announced that he would be quitting the band. In front of a crowd of 10,000 in three services at Valley Bible Fellowship in Bakersfield, California, Welch said &quot;I was addicted to methamphetamines and tried everything ... rehab, stuff on the Internet, but nothing helped me kick it. I was trying on my own to quit and couldn&#x27;t do it. I wanted to die. No one knew what I was going through. I could not quit. Church was my last shot. I would sit in church high [on drugs]. I would wonder why people would go up to the front after the service. But one day it was for me. I said [to God], &#x27;Show me how to quit.&#x27;&quot;

In a 2013 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Head described his final moments in the band as very tense: &quot;the last year I was in the band, we were gonna kick out the bass player, Fieldy, and this guy&#x27;s girlfriend couldn&#x27;t be on this side of the stage because there were fights with another wife in the band. And obviously the drugs – it&#x27;s no secret I was into the drugs, so crazy stuff, like having to finish our blow right before we got to the border because they were gonna come check to see if we had anything.&quot; Following his departure from Korn, Welch released two autobiographies, a solo album, and formed a band named Love and Death, which released a debut album in 2013.

=== &quot;See You on the Other Side&quot; and Silveria&#x27;s departure (2005–2007) ===
Korn at the [[MTV Asia Awards 2006|MTV Asia Awards]] in [[Bangkok|Bangkok, Thailand]], 2006
Upon completing their record deal with Sony, Korn partnered with EMI and signed to Virgin Records. As part of this innovative arrangement, Virgin paid Korn $25 million upfront in exchange for a share in the profits of their next two studio albums, including tours and merchandising. Virgin also received a 30 percent stake in the band&#x27;s licensing, ticket sales, and other revenue sources.

The band&#x27;s first album for Virgin Records, &quot;See You on the Other Side&quot;, was released on December 6, 2005, and debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, scanning close to 221,000 copies. The album managed to stay in the top half of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for 34 consecutive weeks. The first single from the album, &quot;Twisted Transistor&quot;, was accompanied by a music video directed by Dave Meyers in which hip hop artists Xzibit, Lil Jon, Snoop Dogg, and David Banner portray Korn. &quot;Twisted Transistor&quot; peaked at number 64 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The second single, &quot;Coming Undone&quot;, was released in February 2006, peaking at number 79 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The music video was directed by Little X. &quot;See You on the Other Side&quot; was certified Platinum in the United States, and by mid-2007, the album had sold over 2.2 million copies worldwide.

Korn held a press conference at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery on January 13, 2006, announcing the &quot;See You on the Other Side&quot; Tour. 10 Years and Mudvayne were selected to open all dates of the tour, which kicked off in their hometown of Bakersfield on what Mayor Harvey Hall officially declared as &quot;Korn Day&quot;, February 24. The resurrection of their Family Values Tour was announced on April 18, 2006, which featured co-headliners Deftones, Stone Sour, Flyleaf, and the Japanese metal group Dir En Grey on the main stage. Korn and Evanescence co-headlined the 2007 edition, with Atreyu, Flyleaf, Hellyeah, and Trivium rounding out the main stage.

While promoting &quot;See You on the Other Side&quot; in Europe, Jonathan Davis was diagnosed with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, a blood platelet disorder that hospitalized him for the weekend and prevented him from performing at the renowned Download Festival. Despite the illness, the band still performed with guest singers, including Corey Taylor of Slipknot and Stone Sour fame; Trivium&#x27;s Matt Heafy; Skindred&#x27;s Benji Webbe; and Avenged Sevenfold&#x27;s M. Shadows. This led to Korn canceling the rest of their European bill for 2006, including the Hellfest Summer Open Air. It was originally unknown to the public what his ailment was, but the singer revealed in a letter to fans that he was &quot;dangerously low on blood platelets and at a high risk of death from a hemorrhage if the problem was not treated&quot;.

In early December 2006 it was announced that founding drummer David Silveria would be taking an indefinite &quot;temporary hiatus&quot; from the band. Korn then performed at the MTV studios in Times Square on December 9, 2006, for the &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; series, which was broadcast on February 23, 2007, through MTV.com and on March 2, 2007, across North American, South American, European, and Asian MTV stations. Korn played a 14-song acoustic set, complete with guest appearances by the Cure and Amy Lee of Evanescence. The performance was eventually cut down to 11 songs for the album, two of which did not air on MTV. Sales of nearly 51,000 brought &quot;MTV Unplugged: Korn&quot; to number nine in its first week out.

=== Untitled eighth album and Luzier&#x27;s addition (2007–2008) ===
Korn&#x27;s untitled album was released on July 31, 2007, debuting at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 123,000 copies sold in its first week. The album was certified gold by the RIAA. It concluded Korn&#x27;s deal with Virgin Records and features touring keyboardist Zac Baird. Drumming duties were left up to Terry Bozzio and Bad Religion&#x27;s Brooks Wackerman, as David Silveria went on a hiatus. Joey Jordison from Slipknot played drums during Korn&#x27;s live shows until the permanent addition of Ray Luzier (Army of Anyone, David Lee Roth). This confirmed David&#x27;s departure.

&quot;Evolution&quot; and &quot;Hold On&quot; were released as singles to promote the untitled album. The former peaked at number seven on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. A third single, &quot;Kiss&quot;, had a limited release in April 2008. Korn covered the song &quot;Kidnap the Sandy Claws&quot; in 2008, which was originally performed by Paul Reubens, Catherine O&#x27;Hara, and Danny Elfman and was released on the compilation album &quot;Nightmare Revisited&quot;.

Ubisoft reported in October 2008 that Korn had &quot;written and recorded an original song inspired by Ubisoft&#x27;s &quot;Haze&quot; video game, simply entitled &quot;Haze&quot;, which was released on April 22, 2008. Korn also released a live DVD, &quot;Live at Montreux 2004&quot;, one of their performances with former guitarist Brian Welch on May 12, 2008.

=== &quot;Korn III: Remember Who You Are&quot; (2009–2011) ===
In a YouTube video, bassist Reginald &quot;Fieldy&quot; Arvizu affirmed that a charity song titled &quot;A Song for Chi&quot; would be released, featuring Slipknot guitarist Jim Root; Clint Lowery of Sevendust; drummer Dave McClain of Machine Head; and former Korn guitarist Brian &quot;Head&quot; Welch, among many other musicians. The song was intended to raise money for Deftones bassist Chi Cheng, who fell into a comatose state following a car accident in November 2008.

Along with the announcement of the Ballroom Blitz Tour in March 2010, the title for the new album was revealed as &quot;Korn III: Remember Who You Are&quot;. Later that month, Munky announced that Korn has officially signed to Roadrunner Records. Jonathan Davis later confirmed the record deal: &quot;We&#x27;re going to go to Roadrunner. [It is] real exciting for us, too, because they&#x27;re one of the last record companies to let you do what you want to do.&quot; Davis continued, &quot;All the great bands around are on that label and everything seems to just work out right and it seems like a good home for us right now.&quot;

The lead single, &quot;Oildale&quot;, was made available for streaming in May 2010. &quot;Oildale (Leave Me Alone)&quot; was simultaneously released to radio stations and became a top-10 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock airplay chart. A music video directed by Phil Mucci received an exclusive premiere on MTV2.

&quot;Korn III: Remember Who You Are&quot; was released on July 13, 2010. It debuted and peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 63,000 purchases reported. A second single, &quot;Let the Guilt Go&quot;, was released that same month, reaching number 23 on Mainstream Rock. &quot;Pop a Pill&quot; was scheduled to be the third single from &quot;Korn III: Remember Who You Are&quot;, but plans were scrapped by Roadrunner Records due to unsatisfactory results with previous singles. Korn co-headlined the Music as a Weapon V tour with Disturbed in late 2010 and early 2011. The tour also featured supporting acts Sevendust and In This Moment.

=== &quot;The Path of Totality&quot; (2011–2012) ===

Korn&#x27;s tenth studio album, &quot;The Path of Totality&quot;, was released on December 6, 2011. It was the second and final studio album for Roadrunner Records. The album features contributions from Skrillex; 12th Planet; Excision; Downlink; Kill the Noise; Noisia; and various other EDM artists.

&quot;The Path of Totality&quot; debuted and peaked at number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 55,000 copies scanned. &quot;Get Up!&quot; was premiered as the lead single via &quot;Spin&quot; in April 2011. The single managed to peak at number eight on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. It eventually became their first single to be certified gold in the United States. The second single, &quot;Narcissistic Cannibal&quot;, was released in October 2011, with its music video being directed and produced by Alexander Bulkley of ShadowMachine Films.

After a stint of festival appearances, Korn promoted &quot;The Path of Totality&quot; during a headlining tour of the same name. Korn split their show into three sections. The band kicked off by playing tracks from their first two albums, including the B-side &quot;Proud&quot;, which was originally included on the soundtrack to the 1997 film &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;. They followed with a different stage set up, playing several of their new songs. The set list ended with hit singles and an encore. Other appearances came from Datsik, Downlink, and Dope D.O.D. A special album release performance filmed and recorded at the Hollywood Palladium was issued in various formats through Shout! Factory in September 2012. &quot;The Path of Totality&quot; won Album of the Year at the 2012 Revolver Golden Gods Awards. This was Korn&#x27;s first victory at the Golden Gods Awards, a ceremony that celebrates the best in hard rock and heavy metal music. Korn was also inducted into the Kerrang! Hall of Fame during the 2011 Kerrang! Awards.

=== &quot;The Paradigm Shift&quot; and Welch&#x27;s return (2012–2015) ===
On May 5, 2012, guitarist Brian &quot;Head&quot; Welch joined Korn on stage at the Carolina Rebellion festival to play &quot;Blind&quot; for the first time since his departure. As recalled in the documentary DVD &quot;Reconciliation&quot;, Welch&#x27;s appearance was a spur-of-the-moment decision: Welch initially visited the festival because of his daughter, who was a fan of bands performing. Welch joined Red on stage for a song, and would eventually be persuaded to join his old bandmates in Korn for a meet and greet. Upon Korn preparing for the show, the guitar tech prepared an extra guitar and amplifier for Welch, &quot;just in case&quot;.

On July 18, 2012, Jonathan Davis told Billboard.com that Korn was getting ready to start recording their eleventh studio album that would be released independently. It was also announced that their next album would not contain any dubstep influences like &quot;The Path of Totality&quot;. Guitarist James &quot;Munky&quot; Shaffer stated in an interview with the &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot; that the new album would be heavier, with more aggressive &quot;in-your-face&quot; guitars and vocals. He went on to say that he would be using new recording techniques in the studio to give his riffs a fresh approach.

In November 2012, Mudvayne bassist Ryan Martinie toured Korn as a temporary replacement for Reginald Arvizu, who stayed at home during his wife&#x27;s pregnancy. That month also saw the confirmation of Welch&#x27;s return to the band. His comeback was initially thought to be temporary as he was only scheduled for two shows in June 2013 at Rock Am Ring and Rock Im Park, but Ray Luzier announced at the January 25 Sabian show during NAMM that Welch would be working the whole tour.

In January 2013, techno artist Beta Traxx acknowledged he was working on a new Korn song for their upcoming album, which he commented would sound &quot;like the past and the future at the same time.&quot; Luzier affirmed that the album would be produced by Don Gilmore. The BK Entertainment Group updated their clients list on February 12 and attested that Korn had signed to their management&#x27;s independent label - Prospect Park Productions.

On June 1, Caroline Records added Korn to their roster confirming that the band have been signed on to a contract with the label; they are partnered with Korn&#x27;s management Prospect Park. On February 18, 2013, Korn posted a photo showing Head as part of the line up, which escalated rumors that he was in the process to rejoin Korn permanently. This was confirmed by Head himself in May, when it was also confirmed that he had been recording as part of the band for their upcoming album.
Fieldy has said of the album &quot;Right now, I will tell you this ... we&#x27;ve done something we&#x27;ve never done before. Normally if we do a new Korn record, we&#x27;ll normally put 12 or 13 songs and that&#x27;s how many we make. This time we&#x27;ve made 20-plus songs, and we&#x27;ll put the best of what we have on there, whatever the numbers end up being. We have so many to choose from, I think it&#x27;s going to be a little extra special this time.&quot; Munky later confirmed this by saying that the band completed 25 songs and 15 of them would be put on the album. Head later elaborated that musically this was Korn&#x27;s best album.

Korn&#x27;s eleventh studio album, &quot;The Paradigm Shift&quot;, was released on October 8, 2013. Their first single, &quot;Never Never&quot; was set to be released August 12, 2013. The band recorded an episode of Guitar Center Sessions for DirecTV on September 11, 2013, which is scheduled to premiere November 1, 2013 on DirecTV Audience Channel. Korn will also be the latest act to be inducted into the world-famous Hollywood Rockwalk on October 8, 2013.

The band brought back their Family Values Tour as a one-day festival, on October 5, 2013. The venue and line up were revealed on September 3, 2013. The music video for &quot;Spike in My Veins&quot; was released on February 6, 2014. The band performed the entirety of their self-titled debut album on several occasions during 2015.

===&quot;The Serenity of Suffering&quot; (2015–2018)===
Korn soon began the process of writing new songs for a twelfth studio album. Guitarist Head described the music on the new album as &quot;heavier than anyone&#x27;s heard us in a long time.&quot; Their twelfth studio album &quot;The Serenity of Suffering&quot; was released on October 21, 2016. On July 14, 2016, guitarist James &quot;Munky&quot; Shaffer revealed to &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; that Corey Taylor of Slipknot/Stone Sour would make a guest appearance on the new album. He also revealed Nick Raskulinecz as the album&#x27;s producer. On July 16, 2016, Korn premiered a new song, &quot;Rotting in Vain&quot;, at Chicago Open Air Festival.

In late 2016, Zac Baird left the live band after 10 years. Jules Venturini completed the tour before Davey Oberlin was brought into the band. It was later announced that Fieldy would be missing Korn&#x27;s South American tour and Robert Trujillo&#x27;s then-12-year-old son Tye was brought in to perform with the band for the tour&#x27;s duration.

In March 2018, Korn embarked on a Japanese tour with support from Deadly Apples, including a stop at Vans Warped Tour Japan.

=== &quot;The Nothing&quot; (2018–2020) ===
On May 15, 2018, Korn announced the dates of special shows in order to mark the 20th anniversary of their album &quot;Follow the Leader&quot;. In order to mark the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, the band partnered with the clothing company Pleasures to release clothing merchandise dedicated to the album.

In August 2018, Luzier reported via Instagram that Korn has begun the process of tracking drums for the upcoming thirteenth album. In a December 2018 interview to &quot;Revolver Magazine&quot;, Welch revealed that the upcoming album was scheduled for release in fall 2019, with Nick Raskulinecz resuming production duties. He also stated some of the tracks had been co-written with John Feldmann and that the band had tracked demos with Travis Barker on drums.

On June 25, 2019, the band revealed that their latest album, &quot;The Nothing&quot;, would be released on September 13, 2019, and unveiled its first single: &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Find Me&quot;. On August 2, the band released a brand new song from &quot;The Nothing&quot; called &quot;Cold&quot;. On August 22, Korn announced their new album by playing a concert in multiplayer game AdventureQuest 3D, complete with in-game merchandise, a virtual meet-and-greet, and performing a new song on a digital stage.

In July 2020, Korn released a cover of &quot;The Devil Went Down to Georgia&quot; by Charlie Daniels, who had died earlier that year. The cover was recorded during sessions for &quot;The Nothing&quot; and featured rapper Yelawolf and proceeds were donated to non-profit &quot;Awakening Youth&quot;.

During an interview with &quot;Wall of Sound&quot;, Munky spoke about COVID ruining their plans to tour &quot;The Nothing&quot;, stating &quot;It was kind of a fucking bummer, I gotta be honest man. I was so excited [with] that album. We put the artwork together, we designed the stages, we got everything ready to roll out, merch and all; you know everything a band does before they go on the road and promote an album.&quot;

=== &quot;Requiem&quot;, Fieldy&#x27;s hiatus and upcoming fifteenth studio album (2021–present) ===
In his first online interview of 2021, Brian Welch revealed that the band had plans for 2021 but was coy about what they were, hinting it had something to do with touring in a powerful way. On April 24, 2021, Korn released a one-off, online streaming event entitled &quot;Monumental&quot; that was filmed on the top of a parking structure at the &quot;Stranger Things: A Drive-Into Experience&quot; set in Los Angeles.

On May 12, the band announced a 28-date summer U.S. tour with Staind as the supporting act. The 2021 tour came after Korn was forced to cancel their planned 2020 run with Faith No More due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On June 21, the band announced that their bassist Arvizu would be taking a hiatus and wouldn&#x27;t be performing with the band on their upcoming summer tour. Ra Díaz of Suicidal Tendencies replaced Arvizu on the tour.

The tour was marred by several separate instances where members contracted COVID-19: first, Jonathan Davis tested positive in August, causing several dates to be postponed. Then in September, Munky was forced to sit out several dates, being replaced by Love and Death guitarist JR Bareis while he recovered. Lastly, in October Ray Luzier also tested positive, missing the next three shows while Fever 333 drummer Aric Improta stepped in.

On April 23, the band confirmed that they had begun work on a fourteenth studio album, utilizing the period of lockdown due to COVID-19 to begin writing. The album was said to be fully written as of April 2021. A new single was released November 11 entitled &quot;Start the Healing&quot;, with the music video debuting in a YouTube premiere. On January 13, 2022, the band released the second single from the album entitled &quot;Forgotten&quot;. The album &quot;Requiem&quot; was released on February 4, 2022. On April 21, 2022, the band released a music video for the song, &quot;Worst Is on Its Way&quot;.

Shortly prior to the release of &quot;Requiem&quot;, Davis revealed in an interview with Music Feeds that the band were already in the process of working on a follow-up studio album. Welch later stated in a September 2023 interview that a release of new material in 2024 was likely: &quot;Yeah, [there will be] new music coming out next year. I don&#x27;t know. We&#x27;re just kind of in hiding right now, just doing our own thing.&quot; Welch reiterated in late March 2024 that work was still underway, speaking positively regarding the content recorded thus far. In early December, he stated that while the majority of the album had been written, there were no plans to release anything in the immediate future.

==Artistry==
===Style and instrumentation===

Korn is identified as the pioneers of nu metal music, a form of alternative metal music which began in the mid-1990s. While generally considered an alternative metal and nu metal band, the band has also been labeled as heavy metal, grunge, rap rock, rap metal, funk metal, groove metal and hard rock. They are characterized by the style that incorporated downtuned guitars, a groove-heavy rhythm section, haunted atmospheric production, and dark lyrics. Their lyrics focus on pain and personal alienation rather than traditional heavy metal themes.

Historically, when &quot;Life Is Peachy&quot; was released, the band&#x27;s music was not yet labeled &quot;nu metal&quot;. Thus, in November 1996, Korn was described as &quot;one of the key players in an American metal revival&quot; alongside Deftones, &quot;two bands that share the same roots&quot;. In the music community, there have been disagreements whether the band should be considered as &quot;heavy metal&quot;. In 2015, lead singer Jonathan Davis commented, &quot;Yeah, we&#x27;re heavy and downtuned, but metal, to me, is like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden, that&#x27;s metal man. I always thought of us as a funk band.&quot; Additionally, in an interview with Metal Hammer, Davis said that he had hated the &quot;nu metal&quot; tag. Korn is widely credited as the originators of the nu metal scene. It means that the genre was suddenly inundated with imitators of their sound.

Bassist Reginald Arvizu plays his instrument using both the techniques of fingerstyle and slapping. Jonathan Davis was said by author Doug Small to be &quot;the eye of the storm around which the music of Korn rages.&quot; Small described the band as &quot;a basket-case full of contradictions.&quot;

===Lyrical themes===
Many of Korn&#x27;s first works are based on early experiences. The song &quot;Daddy&quot; was described by lead singer Jonathan Davis: &quot;When I was a kid, I was being abused by somebody else and I went to my parents and told them about it, and they thought I was lying and joking around. They never did shit about it. They didn&#x27;t believe it was happening to their son... I don&#x27;t really like to talk about that song. This is as much as I&#x27;ve ever talked about it...&quot; &quot;Kill You&quot; was written about Davis&#x27;s experiences as a child with his stepmother. &quot;Follow the Leader&quot; marked the first album where the majority of the lyrics did not have origins relating to early occurrences, with songs like &quot;Justin&quot; and &quot;Pretty&quot; written about incidents occurring during adulthood.

===Influences===
A few years before establishing Korn, James &quot;Munky&quot; Shaffer; Reginald &quot;Fieldy&quot; Arvizu; and David Silveria (who were three members of the funk rock band L.A.P.D.), alongside friend Brian &quot;Head&quot; Welch, all had the common influences of Red Hot Chili Peppers and especially the Faith No More album &quot;The Real Thing&quot;. Likewise, Davis was greatly inspired by the adventurousness of &quot;The Real Thing&quot; upon its 1989 release: &quot;It showed everybody you could do heavy music and not be &#x27;metal&#x27;. It was something completely different.&quot;

In the &quot;Guitar World&quot; section &quot;The Album that Changed My Life&quot; of January 1997, Welch listed &quot;The Real Thing&quot; by Faith No More as the album that changed his life, while Arvizu named both the Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; &quot;Freaky Styley&quot; and Faith No More&#x27;s &quot;Introduce Yourself&quot;. Fieldy&#x27;s biggest bass influences were Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers and Les Claypool from Primus. He was also greatly inspired by Billy Gould&#x27;s chemistry with his Faith No More bandmates and Stanley Clarke. In 2015, asked about what record has stuck with him through the years, Munky first named 1992&#x27;s &quot;Angel Dust&quot; by Faith No More, followed by &quot;Evil Empire&quot; by Rage Against the Machine and &quot;The Fragile&quot; by Nine Inch Nails. For his part, David Silveria named Mike Bordin of Faith No More one of his biggest influences.

Munky later acknowledged the song structures and instrumentations of Faith No More in inspiring Korn&#x27;s future songwriting: &quot;Faith No More steered us in the direction where we ultimately ended up.&quot; They became &quot;fanatics&quot; of Faith No More singer Mike Patton, researched about him, and traveled to the band&#x27;s hometown of San Francisco in order to watch them play. In this way, they discovered Patton&#x27;s avant-garde metal band Mr. Bungle, whose 1991 self-titled album had a long-standing impact on Korn&#x27;s experimentation, dissonance, and eccentric stylings. A notable example of Bungle&#x27;s influence has been what Korn dubbed the &quot;Mr. Bungle chord&quot; (a flat fifth chord or &quot;tritone&quot;), which became a band trademark throughout their discography. Many reviewers point out stark similarities between the vocals of Davis and several techniques employed by Patton, such as those from &quot;Angel Dust&quot;. Davis&#x27; rhythmic and aggressive singing was also based on toasting, a reggae/dancehall vocal style that emphasizes rhythm and embellishments.

Besides the projects of Patton, Korn had a wide range of influences that included groove-oriented metal acts such as Sepultura, Prong, and Biohazard, in addition to the dynamics and live performances of Rage Against the Machine and its frontman Zack de la Rocha. Head later explained that they tried to mix the weird elements of Bungle with catchy choruses and melodies, alongside the songwriting and grooves from those metal bands. On the other hand, Fieldy discards any influence classic rock groups like The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin have had on Korn; &quot;Nobody in the band ever listened to that stuff.&quot; However, Jonathan Davis acknowledged in 2022 that the song that first made him interested in rock music was Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; (1969).

Much of Korn&#x27;s work has also been inspired by hip hop music, as suggested in the band&#x27;s song &quot;All in the Family&quot; and the cover song of Ice Cube&#x27;s &quot;Wicked&quot;. The band imitated the samples used by Cypress Hill, with Davis going as far to say &quot;If there&#x27;s no Cypress Hill there would be no Korn.&quot; The members of Korn are also influenced by Alice in Chains, Pantera, N.W.A, Bauhaus, Geto Boys, Van Halen, The Pharcyde, Nine Inch Nails, Deftones, and John Zorn.

==In other media==
They have contributed music to the soundtracks for movies such as &quot;The Crow: City of Angels&quot;, &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, &quot;Spawn&quot;, &quot;End of Days&quot;, and &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life&quot;. The music of Korn has also been featured on various television series, including &quot;South Park&quot; (which they starred as guests), &quot;Beavis and Butt-head&quot;, and &quot;Daria&quot;.

==Legacy==
The band has sold over 40 million records worldwide as of 2021. Seven of their official releases are certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA); two are certified double platinum; one is certified triple platinum; one is certified five times platinum; and two are certified Gold. Fourteen of their records have reached the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with eight reaching the top five; they are tied with Van Halen for the most top 10 records as a rock or metal artist. The band has also won two Grammy Awards from eight nominations.

Korn&#x27;s debut album has been recognized for its influence on heavy music. Bands such as Coal Chamber and Limp Bizkit were inspired by the album&#x27;s &quot;churning rage, emphasizing similar grooves and song structures&quot; and &quot;the sound&#x27;s hip-hop elements.&quot; Slipknot, Machine Head, and Sepultura were also inspired by Korn&#x27;s debut album. The album launched the career of record producer Ross Robinson, who later produced albums such as &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Yall&quot; by Limp Bizkit, Sepultura&#x27;s &quot;Roots&quot; and Slipknot&#x27;s first two albums. Amy Lee of Evanescence also cited Korn as an influence growing up. Mucc guitarist Miya said that Davis&#x27; intense personal expressions in Korn influenced him to do the same in his own music. Richard S. He of &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote: &quot;More than any other album, &quot;Follow the Leader&quot; opened the floodgates for countless nu-metal acts to infiltrate the mainstream.&quot; In the book &quot;Nu-metal: The Next Generation of Rock &amp; Punk&quot;, Korn was marked as the third biggest nu metal band in the world. Korn created a fan-base described by Doug Small and Eaton Entertainment as extremely loyal.

Korn&#x27;s music videos received significant play on &quot;Total Request Live&quot;, and alongside Limp Bizkit were credited with pitting the nu metal genre against pop acts such as Backstreet Boys, NSYNC and Britney Spears. The band&#x27;s videos had often peaked at the third spot of the show&#x27;s chart, which was dubbed &quot;the Korn spot&quot;. Four of their videos had retired from the show. They have also earned two Video Music Awards from 11 nominations.

<text>In the industrial design field of human–computer interaction, a user interface (UI) is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur. The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of the machine from the human end, while the machine simultaneously feeds back information that aids the operators&#x27; decision-making process. Examples of this broad concept of user interfaces include the interactive aspects of computer operating systems, hand tools, heavy machinery operator controls and process controls. The design considerations applicable when creating user interfaces are related to, or involve such disciplines as, ergonomics and psychology.

Generally, the goal of user interface design is to produce a user interface that makes it easy, efficient, and enjoyable (user-friendly) to operate a machine in the way which produces the desired result (i.e. maximum usability). This generally means that the operator needs to provide minimal input to achieve the desired output, and also that the machine minimizes undesired outputs to the user.

User interfaces are composed of one or more layers, including a human–machine interface (HMI) that typically interfaces machines with physical input hardware (such as keyboards, mice, or game pads) and output hardware (such as computer monitors, speakers, and printers). A device that implements an HMI is called a human interface device (HID). User interfaces that dispense with the physical movement of body parts as an intermediary step between the brain and the machine use no input or output devices except electrodes alone; they are called brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) or brain–machine interfaces (BMIs).

Other terms for human–machine interfaces are man–machine interface (MMI) and, when the machine in question is a computer, human–computer interface. Additional UI layers may interact with one or more human senses, including: tactile UI (touch), visual UI (sight), auditory UI (sound), olfactory UI (smell), equilibria UI (balance), and gustatory UI (taste).

Composite user interfaces (CUIs) are UIs that interact with two or more senses. The most common CUI is a &quot;graphical user interface&quot; (GUI), which is composed of a tactile UI and a visual UI capable of displaying graphics. When sound is added to a GUI, it becomes a &quot;multimedia user interface&quot; (MUI). There are three broad categories of CUI: &quot;standard&quot;, &quot;virtual&quot; and &quot;augmented&quot;. Standard CUI use standard human interface devices like keyboards, mice, and computer monitors. When the CUI blocks out the real world to create a virtual reality, the CUI is virtual and uses a &quot;virtual reality interface&quot;. When the CUI does not block out the real world and creates augmented reality, the CUI is augmented and uses an &quot;augmented reality interface&quot;. When a UI interacts with all human senses, it is called a qualia interface, named after the theory of qualia. CUI may also be classified by how many senses they interact with as either an X-sense virtual reality interface or X-sense augmented reality interface, where X is the number of senses interfaced with. For example, a Smell-O-Vision is a 3-sense (3S) Standard CUI with visual display, sound and smells; when &quot;virtual reality interfaces&quot; interface with smells and touch it is said to be a 4-sense (4S) virtual reality interface; and when &quot;augmented reality interfaces&quot; interface with smells and touch it is said to be a 4-sense (4S) augmented reality interface.

== Overview ==

The user interface or &quot;human–machine interface&quot; is the part of the machine that handles the human–machine interaction. Membrane switches, rubber keypads and touchscreens are examples of the physical part of the Human Machine Interface which we can see and touch.

In complex systems, the human–machine interface is typically computerized. The term &quot;human–computer interface&quot; refers to this kind of system. In the context of computing, the term typically extends as well to the software dedicated to control the physical elements used for human–computer interaction.

The engineering of human–machine interfaces is enhanced by considering ergonomics (human factors). The corresponding disciplines are human factors engineering (HFE) and usability engineering (UE) which is part of systems engineering.

Tools used for incorporating human factors in the interface design are developed based on knowledge of computer science, such as computer graphics, operating systems, programming languages. Nowadays, we use the expression graphical user interface for human–machine interface on computers, as nearly all of them are now using graphics.

Multimodal interfaces allow users to interact using more than one modality of user input.

== Terminology ==

There is a difference between a user interface and an operator interface or a human–machine interface (HMI).

* The term &quot;user interface&quot; is often used in the context of (personal) computer systems and electronic devices.
** Where a network of equipment or computers are interlinked through an MES (Manufacturing Execution System)-or Host to display information.
** A human–machine interface (HMI) is typically local to one machine or piece of equipment, and is the interface method between the human and the equipment/machine. An operator interface is the interface method by which multiple pieces of equipment, linked by a host control system, are accessed or controlled.
** The system may expose several user interfaces to serve different kinds of users. For example, a computerized library database might provide two user interfaces, one for library patrons (limited set of functions, optimized for ease of use) and the other for library personnel (wide set of functions, optimized for efficiency).
* The user interface of a mechanical system, a vehicle or an industrial installation is sometimes referred to as the human–machine interface (HMI). HMI is a modification of the original term MMI (man–machine interface). In practice, the abbreviation MMI is still frequently used although some may claim that MMI stands for something different now. Another abbreviation is HCI, but is more commonly used for human–computer interaction. Other terms used are operator interface console (OIC) and operator interface terminal (OIT). However it is abbreviated, the terms refer to the &#x27;layer&#x27; that separates a human that is operating a machine from the machine itself. Without a clean and usable interface, humans would not be able to interact with information systems.

In science fiction, HMI is sometimes used to refer to what is better described as a direct neural interface. However, this latter usage is seeing increasing application in the real-life use of (medical) prostheses—the artificial extension that replaces a missing body part (e.g., cochlear implants).

In some circumstances, computers might observe the user and react according to their actions without specific commands. A means of tracking parts of the body is required, and sensors noting the position of the head, direction of gaze and so on have been used experimentally. This is particularly relevant to immersive interfaces.

== History ==

The history of user interfaces can be divided into the following phases according to the dominant type of user interface:

=== 1945–1968: Batch interface ===

In the batch era, computing power was extremely scarce and expensive. User interfaces were rudimentary. Users had to accommodate computers rather than the other way around; user interfaces were considered overhead, and software was designed to keep the processor at maximum utilization with as little overhead as possible.

The input side of the user interfaces for batch machines was mainly punched cards or equivalent media like paper tape. The output side added line printers to these media. With the limited exception of the system operator&#x27;s console, human beings did not interact with batch machines in real time at all.

Submitting a job to a batch machine involved first preparing a deck of punched cards that described a program and its dataset. The program cards were not punched on the computer itself but on keypunches, specialized, typewriter-like machines that were notoriously bulky, unforgiving, and prone to mechanical failure. The software interface was similarly unforgiving, with very strict syntaxes designed to be parsed by the smallest possible compilers and interpreters.

Once the cards were punched, one would drop them in a job queue and wait. Eventually, operators would feed the deck to the computer, perhaps mounting magnetic tapes to supply another dataset or helper software. The job would generate a printout, containing final results or an abort notice with an attached error log. Successful runs might also write a result on magnetic tape or generate some data cards to be used in a later computation.

The turnaround time for a single job often spanned entire days. If one was very lucky, it might be hours; there was no real-time response. But there were worse fates than the card queue; some computers required an even more tedious and error-prone process of toggling in programs in binary code using console switches. The very earliest machines had to be partly rewired to incorporate program logic into themselves, using devices known as plugboards.

Early batch systems gave the currently running job the entire computer; program decks and tapes had to include what we would now think of as operating system code to talk to I/O devices and do whatever other housekeeping was needed. Midway through the batch period, after 1957, various groups began to experiment with so-called &quot;load-and-go&quot; systems. These used a monitor program which was always resident on the computer. Programs could call the monitor for services. Another function of the monitor was to do better error checking on submitted jobs, catching errors earlier and more intelligently and generating more useful feedback to the users. Thus, monitors represented the first step towards both operating systems and explicitly designed user interfaces.

=== 1969–present: Command-line user interface ===


Command-line interfaces (CLIs) evolved from batch monitors connected to the system console. Their interaction model was a series of request-response transactions, with requests expressed as textual commands in a specialized vocabulary. Latency was far lower than for batch systems, dropping from days or hours to seconds. Accordingly, command-line systems allowed the user to change their mind about later stages of the transaction in response to real-time or near-real-time feedback on earlier results. Software could be exploratory and interactive in ways not possible before. But these interfaces still placed a relatively heavy mnemonic load on the user, requiring a serious investment of effort and learning time to master.

The earliest command-line systems combined teleprinters with computers, adapting a mature technology that had proven effective for mediating the transfer of information over wires between human beings. Teleprinters had originally been invented as devices for automatic telegraph transmission and reception; they had a history going back to 1902 and had already become well-established in newsrooms and elsewhere by 1920. In reusing them, economy was certainly a consideration, but psychology and the rule of least surprise mattered as well; teleprinters provided a point of interface with the system that was familiar to many engineers and users.

The widespread adoption of video-display terminals (VDTs) in the mid-1970s ushered in the second phase of command-line systems. These cut latency further, because characters could be thrown on the phosphor dots of a screen more quickly than a printer head or carriage can move. They helped quell conservative resistance to interactive programming by cutting ink and paper consumables out of the cost picture, and were to the first TV generation of the late 1950s and 60s even more iconic and comfortable than teleprinters had been to the computer pioneers of the 1940s.

Just as importantly, the existence of an accessible screen—a two-dimensional display of text that could be rapidly and reversibly modified—made it economical for software designers to deploy interfaces that could be described as visual rather than textual. The pioneering applications of this kind were computer games and text editors; close descendants of some of the earliest specimens, such as rogue(6), and vi(1), are still a live part of Unix tradition.

=== 1985: SAA user interface or text-based user interface ===

In 1985, with the beginning of Microsoft Windows and other graphical user interfaces, IBM created what is called the Systems Application Architecture (SAA) standard which include the Common User Access (CUA) derivative. CUA successfully created what we know and use today in Windows, and most of the more recent DOS or Windows Console Applications will use that standard as well.

This defined that a pulldown menu system should be at the top of the screen, status bar at the bottom, shortcut keys should stay the same for all common functionality (F2 to Open for example would work in all applications that followed the SAA standard). This greatly helped the speed at which users could learn an application so it caught on quick and became an industry standard.

=== 1968–present: Graphical user interface ===


* 1968 – Douglas Engelbart demonstrated NLS, a system which uses a mouse, pointers, hypertext, and multiple windows.
* 1970 – Researchers at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (many from SRI) develop WIMP paradigm (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointers)
* 1973 – Xerox Alto: commercial failure due to expense, poor user interface, and lack of programs
* 1979 – Steve Jobs and other Apple engineers visit Xerox PARC. Though Pirates of Silicon Valley dramatizes the events, Apple had already been working on developing a GUI, such as the Macintosh and Lisa projects, before the visit.
* 1981 – Xerox Star: focus on WYSIWYG. Commercial failure (25K sold) due to cost ($16K each), performance (minutes to save a file, couple of hours to recover from crash), and poor marketing
* 1982 – Rob Pike and others at Bell Labs designed Blit, which was released in 1984 by AT&amp;T and Teletype as DMD 5620 terminal.
* 1984 – Apple Macintosh popularizes the GUI. Super Bowl commercial shown twice, was the most expensive commercial ever made at that time
* 1984 – MIT&#x27;s X Window System: hardware-independent platform and networking protocol for developing GUIs on UNIX-like systems
* 1985 – Windows 1.0 – provided GUI interface to MS-DOS. No overlapping windows (tiled instead).
* 1985 – Microsoft and IBM start work on OS/2 meant to eventually replace MS-DOS and Windows
* 1986 – Apple threatens to sue Digital Research because their GUI desktop looked too much like Apple&#x27;s Mac.
* 1987 – Windows 2.0 – Overlapping and resizable windows, keyboard and mouse enhancements
* 1987 – Macintosh II: first full-color Mac
* 1988 – OS/2 1.10 Standard Edition (SE) has GUI written by Microsoft, looks a lot like Windows 2

== Interface design ==
Primary methods used in the interface design include prototyping and simulation.

Typical human–machine interface design consists of the following stages: interaction specification, interface software specification and prototyping:

* Common practices for interaction specification include user-centered design, persona, activity-oriented design, scenario-based design, and resiliency design.
* Common practices for interface software specification include use cases and constrain enforcement by interaction protocols (intended to avoid use errors).
* Common practices for prototyping are based on libraries of interface elements (controls, decoration, etc.).

=== Principles of quality ===

In broad terms, interfaces generally regarded as user friendly, efficient, intuitive, etc. are typified by one or more particular qualities. For the purpose of example, a non-exhaustive list of such characteristics follows:

# Clarity: The interface avoids ambiguity by making everything clear through language, flow, hierarchy and metaphors for visual elements.
# Concision: However ironically, the over-clarification of information—for instance, by labelling the majority, if not the entirety, of items displayed on-screen at once, and regardless of whether or not the user would in fact require a visual indicator of some kind in order to identify a given item—can, and, under most normal circumstances, most likely will lead to the obfuscation of whatever information.
# Familiarity: Even if someone uses an interface for the first time, certain elements can still be familiar. Real-life metaphors can be used to communicate meaning.
# Responsiveness: A good interface should not feel sluggish. This means that the interface should provide good feedback to the user about what&#x27;s happening and whether the user&#x27;s input is being successfully processed.
# Consistency: Keeping your interface consistent across your application is important because it allows users to recognize usage patterns.
# Aesthetics: While you do not need to make an interface attractive for it to do its job, making something look good will make the time your users spend using your application more enjoyable; and happier users can only be a good thing.
# Efficiency: Time is money, and a great interface should make the user more productive through shortcuts and good design.
# Forgiveness: A good interface should not punish users for their mistakes but should instead provide the means to remedy them.

=== Principle of least astonishment ===

The principle of least astonishment (POLA) is a general principle in the design of all kinds of interfaces. It is based on the idea that human beings can only pay full attention to one thing at one time, leading to the conclusion that novelty should be minimized.

=== Principle of habit formation ===

If an interface is used persistently, the user will unavoidably develop habits for using the interface. The designer&#x27;s role can thus be characterized as ensuring the user forms good habits. If the designer is experienced with other interfaces, they will similarly develop habits, and often make unconscious assumptions regarding how the user will interact with the interface.

=== A model of design criteria: User Experience Honeycomb ===

Peter Morville of Google designed the User Experience Honeycomb framework in 2004 when leading operations in user interface design. The framework was created to guide user interface design. It would act as a guideline for many web development students for a decade.

# Usable: Is the design of the system easy and simple to use? The application should feel familiar, and it should be easy to use.
# Useful: Does the application fulfill a need? A business&#x27;s product or service needs to be useful.
# Desirable: Is the design of the application sleek and to the point? The aesthetics of the system should be attractive, and easy to translate.
# Findable: Are users able to quickly find the information they are looking for? Information needs to be findable and simple to navigate. A user should never have to hunt for your product or information.
# Accessible: Does the application support enlarged text without breaking the framework? An application should be accessible to those with disabilities.
# Credible: Does the application exhibit trustworthy security and company details? An application should be transparent, secure, and honest.
# Valuable: Does the end-user think it&#x27;s valuable? If all 6 criteria are met, the end-user will find value and trust in the application.

== Types ==

# &quot;Attentive user interfaces&quot; manage the user attention deciding when to interrupt the user, the kind of warnings, and the level of detail of the messages presented to the user.
# &quot;Batch interfaces&quot; are non-interactive user interfaces, where the user specifies all the details of the &quot;batch job&quot; in advance to batch processing, and receives the output when all the processing is done. The computer does not prompt for further input after the processing has started.
# &quot;Command line interfaces&quot; (CLIs) prompt the user to provide input by typing a command string with the computer keyboard and respond by outputting text to the computer monitor. Used by programmers and system administrators, in engineering and scientific environments, and by technically advanced personal computer users.
# &quot;Conversational interfaces&quot; enable users to command the computer with plain text English (e.g., via text messages, or chatbots) or voice commands, instead of graphic elements. These interfaces often emulate human-to-human conversations.
# &quot;Conversational interface agents&quot; attempt to personify the computer interface in the form of an animated person, robot, or other character (such as Microsoft&#x27;s Clippy the paperclip), and present interactions in a conversational form.
# &quot;Crossing-based interfaces&quot; are graphical user interfaces in which the primary task consists in crossing boundaries instead of pointing.
# &quot;Direct manipulation interface&quot; is a general class of user interfaces that allow users to manipulate objects presented to them, using actions that correspond to the physical world, at least loosely.
# &quot;Gesture interfaces&quot; are graphical user interfaces which accept input in a form of hand gestures, or mouse gestures sketched with a computer mouse or a stylus.
# &quot;Graphical user interfaces&quot; (GUI) accept input via devices such as a computer keyboard and mouse and provide articulated graphical output on the computer monitor. There are at least two different principles widely used in GUI design: Object-oriented user interfaces (OOUIs) and application-oriented interfaces.
# &quot;Hardware interfaces&quot; are the physical, spatial interfaces found on products in the real world from toasters, to car dashboards, to airplane cockpits. They are generally a mixture of knobs, buttons, sliders, switches, and touchscreens.
# &quot;&quot; provide input to electronic or electro-mechanical devices by passing a finger through reproduced holographic images of what would otherwise be tactile controls of those devices, floating freely in the air, detected by a wave source and without tactile interaction.
# &quot;Intelligent user interfaces&quot; are human–machine interfaces that aim to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and naturalness of human–machine interaction by representing, reasoning, and acting on models of the user, domain, task, discourse, and media (e.g., graphics, natural language, gesture).
# &quot;Motion tracking interfaces&quot; monitor the user&#x27;s body motions and translate them into commands, currently being developed by Apple.
# &quot;Multi-screen interfaces&quot;, employ multiple displays to provide a more flexible interaction. This is often employed in computer game interaction in both the commercial arcades and more recently the handheld markets.
# &quot;Natural-language interfaces&quot; are used for search engines and on webpages. User types in a question and waits for a response.
# &quot;Non-command user interfaces&quot;, which observe the user to infer their needs and intentions, without requiring that they formulate explicit commands.
# &quot;Object-oriented user interfaces (OOUI)&quot; are based on object-oriented programming metaphors, allowing users to manipulate simulated objects and their properties.
# &quot;Permission-driven user interfaces&quot; show or conceal menu options or functions depending on the user&#x27;s level of permissions. The system is intended to improve the user experience by removing items that are unavailable to the user. A user who sees functions that are unavailable for use may become frustrated. It also provides an enhancement to security by hiding functional items from unauthorized persons.
# &quot;Reflexive user interfaces&quot; where the users control and redefine the entire system via the user interface alone, for instance to change its command verbs. Typically, this is only possible with very rich graphic user interfaces.
# &quot;Search interface&quot; is how the search box of a site is displayed, as well as the visual representation of the search results.
# &quot;Tangible user interfaces&quot;, which place a greater emphasis on touch and physical environment or its element.
# &quot;Task-focused interfaces&quot; are user interfaces which address the information overload problem of the desktop metaphor by making tasks, not files, the primary unit of interaction.
# &quot;Text-based user interfaces&quot; (TUIs) are user interfaces which interact via text. TUIs include command-line interfaces and text-based WIMP environments.
# &quot;Touchscreens&quot; are displays that accept input by touch of fingers or a stylus. Used in a growing amount of mobile devices and many types of point of sale, industrial processes and machines, self-service machines, etc.
# &quot;Touch user interface&quot; are graphical user interfaces using a touchpad or touchscreen display as a combined input and output device. They supplement or replace other forms of output with haptic feedback methods. Used in computerized simulators, etc.
# &quot;Voice user interfaces&quot;, which accept input and provide output by generating voice prompts. The user input is made by pressing keys or buttons, or responding verbally to the interface.
# &quot;Web-based user interfaces&quot; or &quot;web user interfaces&quot; (WUI) that accept input and provide output by generating web pages viewed by the user using a web browser program.
# &quot;Zero-input interfaces&quot; get inputs from a set of sensors instead of querying the user with input dialogs.
# &quot;Zooming user interfaces&quot; are graphical user interfaces in which information objects are represented at different levels of scale and detail, and where the user can change the scale of the viewed area in order to show more detail.

<text>The Annotated Alice is a 1960 book by Martin Gardner incorporating the text of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s major tales, &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (1865) and &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; (1871), as well as the original illustrations by John Tenniel. It has extensive annotations explaining the contemporary references (including the Victorian poems that Carroll parodies), mathematical concepts, word play, and Victorian traditions (such as the parlor game snap-dragons) featured in the two books.

==History==
The original book was first published in 1960. It has been reprinted several times and translated into French, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, German and Hebrew.

In 1990, a sequel, &quot;More Annotated Alice&quot;, was published. This sequel does not contain the original side notes, and Tenniel&#x27;s illustrations are replaced by those of Peter Newell. It also contains the &quot;suppressed&quot; chapter &quot;The Wasp in a Wig&quot;, which Carroll omitted from the text of &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; on Tenniel&#x27;s recommendation.

In 1999, &quot;The Definitive Edition&quot; was published. It combines the notes from both works and features Tenniel&#x27;s illustrations in improved quality.

Gardner also compiled a companion volume, &quot;The Annotated Snark&quot;, dedicated to Carroll&#x27;s classic nonsense poem &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot;.

In 2015, &quot;The Annotated Alice: 150th Anniversary Deluxe Edition&quot; was published, combining the previous works of Gardner and expanded by Mark Burstein, president emeritus of the Lewis Carroll Society of North America. It includes features such as more than 100 new or updated annotations, over 100 new illustrations by Salvador Dalí, Beatrix Potter, Ralph Steadman, and 42 other artists and illustrators (in addition to original art by Sir John Tenniel), and a filmography of every Alice-related film by Carroll scholar David Schaefer.

<text>Clear and present danger was a doctrine adopted by the Supreme Court of the United States to determine under what circumstances limits can be placed on First Amendment freedoms of speech, press, or assembly. Created by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. to refine the bad tendency test, it was never fully adopted and both tests were ultimately replaced in 1969 with &quot;Brandenburg v. Ohio&quot;″s &quot;imminent lawless action&quot; test.

==History==

Before the 20th century, most restrictions on free speech issues in the United States were imposed to prevent certain types of speech. Although certain kinds of speech continue to be prohibited in advance, dangerous speech started to be punished after the fact in the early 1900s, at a time when US courts primarily relied on a doctrine known as the &quot;bad tendency test&quot;. Rooted in English common law, the test permitted speech to be outlawed if it had a tendency to harm public welfare.

Antiwar protests during World War I gave rise to several important free speech cases related to sedition and inciting violence. In the 1919 case &quot;Schenck v. United States&quot;, the Supreme Court held that an antiwar activist did not have a First Amendment right to advocate draft resistance. In his majority opinion, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. introduced the &quot;clear and present danger test&quot;, which would become an important concept in First Amendment law
In &quot;Frohwerk v. United States&quot; (1919) Justice Holmes summarized comments critical of U.S. wartime policies written by a newspaperman and stated about these comments the following: &quot;It may be that all this might be said or written even in time of war in circumstances that would not make it a crime. We do not lose our right to condemn either measures or men because the country is at war.&quot; This statement &quot;represents an important addendum to the original explication of the clear and present danger test in that it specifies that even during war, courts should regard criticism of government policies and officials as protected speech.&quot;

The &quot;Schenck&quot; decision did not formally adopt the clear and present danger test. Holmes later wrote that he intended the clear and present danger test to refine, not replace, the bad tendency test. Although sometimes mentioned in subsequent rulings, the &quot;clear and present danger test&quot; was never endorsed by the Supreme Court as a test to be used by lower courts when evaluating the constitutionality of legislation that regulated speech.

The Court continued to use the bad tendency test during the early 20th century in cases such as 1919&#x27;s &quot;Abrams v. United States&quot;, which upheld the conviction of antiwar activists who passed out leaflets encouraging workers to impede the war effort. In &quot;Abrams&quot;, Holmes and Justice Brandeis dissented and encouraged the use of the clear and present test, which provided more protection for speech. In 1925&#x27;s &quot;Gitlow v. New York&quot;, the Court made the First Amendment applicable against the states and upheld the conviction of Gitlow for publishing the &quot;Left wing manifesto&quot;. &quot;Gitlow&quot; was decided based on the bad tendency test, but the majority decision acknowledged the validity of the clear and present danger test, yet concluded that its use was limited to &quot;Schenck&quot;-like situations where the speech was not specifically outlawed by the legislature.

Brandeis and Holmes again promoted the clear and present danger test, this time in a concurring opinion in 1927&#x27;s &quot;Whitney v. California&quot; decision. The majority did not adopt or use the clear and present danger test, but the concurring opinion encouraged the Court to support greater protections for speech, and it suggested that &quot;imminent danger&quot;a more restrictive wording than &quot;present danger&quot;should be required before speech can be outlawed. After &quot;Whitney&quot;, the bad tendency test continued to be used by the Court in cases such as &quot;Stromberg v. California&quot;, which held that a 1919 California statute banning red flags was unconstitutional.

The clear and present danger test was invoked by the majority in the 1940 &quot;Thornhill v. Alabama&quot; decision in which a state anti-picketing law was invalidated. Although the Court referred to the clear and present danger test in a few decisions following &quot;Thornhill&quot;, the bad tendency test was not explicitly overruled, and the clear and present danger test was not applied in several subsequent free speech cases involving incitement to violence. The importance of freedom of speech in the context of &quot;clear and present danger&quot; was emphasized in &quot;Terminiello v. City of Chicago&quot; (1949), in which the Supreme Court noted that the vitality of civil and political institutions in society depends on free discussion. Democracy requires free speech because it is only through free debate and free exchange of ideas that government remains responsive to the will of the people and peaceful change is effected. Restrictions on free speech are permissible only when the speech at issue is likely to produce a clear and present danger of a serious substantive evil that rises far above public inconvenience, annoyance, or unrest. Justice William O. Douglas wrote for the Court that &quot;a function of free speech under our system is to invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger.&quot;

===&quot;Dennis v. United States&quot;===
In May 1950, one month before the appeals court heard oral arguments in the &quot;Dennis v. United States&quot; case, the Supreme Court ruled on free speech issues in &quot;American Communications Association v. Douds&quot;. In that case, the Court considered the clear and present danger test, but rejected it as too mechanical and instead introduced a balancing test. The federal appeals court heard oral arguments in the CPUSA case on June 21–23, 1950. Judge Learned Hand considered the clear and present danger test, but his opinion adopted a balancing approach similar to that suggested in &quot;American Communications Association v. Douds&quot;.

The defendants appealed the Second Circuit&#x27;s decision to the Supreme Court in &quot;Dennis v. United States&quot;. The 6–2 decision was issued on June 4, 1951, and upheld Hand&#x27;s decision. Chief Justice Fred Vinson&#x27;s opinion stated that the First Amendment does not require that the government must wait &quot;until the putsch is about to be executed, the plans have been laid and the signal is awaited&quot; before it interrupts seditious plots. In his opinion, Vinson endorsed the balancing approach used by Judge Hand:

==Importance==
Following &quot;Schenck v. United States&quot;, &quot;clear and present danger&quot; became both a public metaphor for First Amendment speech and a standard test in cases before the Court where a United States law limits a citizen&#x27;s First Amendment rights; the law is deemed to be constitutional if it can be shown that the language it prohibits poses a &quot;clear and present danger&quot;. However, the &quot;clear and present danger&quot; criterion of the &quot;Schenck&quot; decision was replaced in 1969 by &quot;Brandenburg v. Ohio&quot;, and the test refined to determining whether the speech would provoke an &quot;imminent lawless action&quot;.

The vast majority of legal scholars have concluded that in writing the &quot;Schenck&quot; opinion, Justice Holmes never meant to replace the &quot;bad tendency&quot; test which had been established in the 1868 English case &quot;R. v. Hicklin&quot; and incorporated into American jurisprudence in the 1904 Supreme Court case &quot;U.S. ex rel. Turner v. Williams&quot;. This is demonstrated by the use of the word &quot;tendency&quot; in &quot;Schenck&quot; itself, a paragraph in &quot;Schenck&quot; explaining that the success of speech in causing the actual harm was not a prerequisite for conviction, and use of the bad-tendency test in the simultaneous &quot;Frohwerk v. United States&quot; and &quot;Debs v. United States&quot; decisions (both of which cite &quot;Schenck&quot; without using the words &quot;clear and present danger&quot;).

However, a subsequent essay by Zechariah Chafee titled &quot;Freedom of Speech in War Time&quot; argued despite context that Holmes had intended to substitute clear and present danger for the bad-tendency standard a more protective standard of free speech. Bad tendency was a far more ambiguous standard where speech could be punished even in the absence of identifiable danger, and as such was strongly opposed by the fledgling American Civil Liberties Union and other libertarians of the time.

Having read Chafee&#x27;s article, Holmes decided to retroactively reinterpret what he had meant by &quot;clear and present danger&quot; and accepted Chafee&#x27;s characterization of the new test in his dissent in &quot;Abrams v. United States&quot; just six months after &quot;Schenck&quot;. &quot;Schenck&quot;, &quot;Frohwerk&quot;, and &quot;Debs&quot; all resulted in unanimous decisions, while &quot;Abrams&quot; did not.

===Brandenburg===

For two decades after the &quot;Dennis&quot; decision, free speech issues related to advocacy of violence were decided using balancing tests such as the one initially articulated in &quot;Dennis&quot;. In 1969, the court established stronger protections for speech in the landmark case &quot;Brandenburg v. Ohio&quot;, which held that &quot;the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action&quot;. &quot;Brandenburg&quot; is now the standard applied by the Court to free speech issues related to advocacy of violence.

<text>Biosafety is the prevention of large-scale loss of biological integrity, focusing both on ecology and human health.
These prevention mechanisms include the conduction of regular reviews of biosafety in laboratory settings, as well as strict guidelines to follow. Biosafety is used to protect from harmful incidents. Many laboratories handling biohazards employ an ongoing risk management assessment and enforcement process for biosafety. Failures to follow such protocols can lead to increased risk of exposure to biohazards or pathogens. Human error and poor technique contribute to unnecessary exposure and compromise the best safeguards set into place for protection.

The international Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety deals primarily with the agricultural definition but many advocacy groups seek to expand it to include post-genetic threats: new molecules, artificial life forms, and even robots which may compete directly in the natural food chain.

Biosafety in agriculture, chemistry, medicine, exobiology and beyond will likely require the application of the precautionary principle, and a new definition focused on the biological nature of the threatened organism rather than the nature of the threat.

When biological warfare or new, currently hypothetical, threats (i.e., robots, new artificial bacteria) are considered, biosafety precautions are generally not sufficient. The new field of biosecurity addresses these complex threats.

Biosafety level refers to the stringency of biocontainment precautions deemed necessary by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for laboratory work with infectious materials.

Typically, institutions that experiment with or create potentially harmful biological material will have a committee or board of supervisors that is in charge of the institution&#x27;s biosafety. They create and monitor the biosafety standards that must be met by labs in order to prevent the accidental release of potentially destructive biological material. (note that in the US, several groups are involved, and efforts are being made to improve processes for government run labs, but there is no unifying regulatory authority for all labs.

Biosafety is related to several fields:

* In ecology (referring to imported life forms from beyond ecoregion borders),
* In agriculture (reducing the risk of alien viral or transgenic genes, genetic engineering or prions such as BSE/&quot;MadCow&quot;, reducing the risk of food bacterial contamination)
* In medicine (referring to organs or tissues from biological origin, or genetic therapy products, virus; levels of lab containment protocols measured as 1, 2, 3, 4 in rising order of danger),
* In chemistry (i.e., nitrates in water, PCB levels affecting fertility)
* In exobiology (i.e., NASA&#x27;s policy for containing alien microbes that may exist on space samples. See planetary protection and interplanetary contamination), and
* In synthetic biology (referring to the risks associated with this type of lab practice)

== Hazards ==
Chemical hazards typically found in laboratory settings include carcinogens, toxins, irritants, corrosives, and sensitizers. Biological hazards include viruses, bacteria, fungi, prions, and biologically derived toxins, which may be present in body fluids and tissue, cell culture specimens, and laboratory animals. Routes of exposure for chemical and biological hazards include inhalation, ingestion, skin contact, and eye contact.

Physical hazards include ergonomic hazards, ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, and noise hazards. Additional safety hazards include burns and cuts from autoclaves, injuries from centrifuges, compressed gas leaks, cold burns from cryogens, electrical hazards, fires, injuries from machinery, and falls.

==In synthetic biology==
A complete understanding of experimental risks associated with synthetic biology is helping to enforce the knowledge and effectiveness of biosafety.
With the potential future creation of man-made unicellular organisms, some are beginning to consider the effect that these organisms will have on biomass already present. Scientists estimate that within the next few decades, organism design will be sophisticated enough to accomplish tasks such as creating biofuels and lowering the levels of harmful substances in the atmosphere. Scientist that favor the development of synthetic biology claim that the use of biosafety mechanisms such as suicide genes and nutrient dependencies will ensure the organisms cannot survive outside of the lab setting in which they were originally created. Organizations like the ETC Group argue that regulations should control the creation of organisms that could potentially harm existing life. They also argue that the development of these organisms will simply shift the consumption of petroleum to the utilization of biomass in order to create energy. These organisms can harm existing life by affecting the prey/predator food chain, reproduction between species, as well as competition against other species (species at risk, or act as an invasive species).
Synthetic vaccines are now being produced in the lab. These have caused a lot of excitement in the pharmaceutical industry as they will be cheaper to produce, allow quicker production, as well as enhance the knowledge of virology and immunology.

==In medicine, healthcare settings and laboratories==
Biosafety, in medicine and health care settings, specifically refers to proper handling of organs or tissues from biological origin, or genetic therapy products, viruses with respect to the environment, to ensure the safety of health care workers, researchers, lab staff, patients, and the general public. Laboratories are assigned a biosafety level numbered 1 through 4 based on their potential biohazard risk level. The employing authority, through the laboratory director, is responsible for ensuring that there is adequate surveillance of the health of laboratory personnel. The objective of such surveillance is to monitor for occupationally acquired diseases. The World Health Organization attributes human error and poor technique as the primary cause of mishandling of biohazardous materials.

Biosafety is also becoming a global concern and requires multilevel resources and international collaboration to monitor, prevent and correct accidents from unintended and malicious release and also to prevent that bioterrorists get their hands-on biologics sample to create biologic weapons of mass destruction. Even people outside of the health sector needs to be involved as in the case of the Ebola outbreak the impact that it had on businesses and travel required that private sectors, international banks together pledged more than $2 billion to combat the epidemic. The bureau of international Security and nonproliferation (ISN) is responsible for managing a broad range of U.S. nonproliferation policies, programs, agreements, and initiatives, and biological weapon is one their concerns
Biosafety has its risks and benefits. All stakeholders must try to find a balance between cost-effectiveness of safety measures and use evidence-based safety practices and recommendations, measure the outcomes and consistently reevaluate the potential benefits that biosafety represents for human health.
Biosafety level designations are based on a composite of the design features, construction, containment facilities, equipment, practices and operational procedures required for working with agents from the various risk groups.

Classification of biohazardous materials is subjective and the risk assessment is determined by the individuals most familiar with the specific characteristics of the organism. There are several factors taken into account when assessing an organism and the classification process.

*Risk Group 1: (no or low individual and community risk) A microorganism that is unlikely to cause human or animal disease.
*Risk Group 2 : (moderate individual risk, low community risk) A pathogen that can cause human or animal disease but is unlikely to be a serious hazard to laboratory workers, the community, livestock or the environment. Laboratory exposures may cause serious infection, but effective treatment and preventive measures are available and the risk of spread of infection is limited.
*Risk Group 3 : (high individual risk, low community risk) A pathogen that usually causes serious human or animal disease but does not ordinarily spread from one infected individual to another. Effective treatment and preventive measures are available.
*Risk Group 4 : (high individual and community risk) A pathogen that usually causes serious human or animal disease and that can be readily transmitted from one individual to another, directly or indirectly. Effective treatment and preventive measures are not usually available.

See World Health Organization Biosafety Laboratory Guidelines (4th edition, 2020): World Health Organization Biosafety Laboratory Guidelines

Investigations have shown that there are hundreds of unreported biosafety accidents, with laboratories self-policing the handling of biohazardous materials and lack of reporting. Poor record keeping, improper disposal, and mishandling biohazardous materials result in increased risks of biochemical contamination for both the public and environment.

Along with the precautions taken during the handling process of biohazardous materials, the World Health Organization recommends: 
Staff training should always include information on safe methods for highly hazardous procedures that are commonly encountered by all laboratory personnel, and which involve:
#Inhalation risks (i.e. aerosol production) when using loops, streaking agar plates,
#pipetting, making smears, opening cultures, taking blood/serum samples, centrifuging, etc.
#Ingestion risks when handling specimens, smears and cultures
#Risks of percutaneous exposures when using syringes and needles
#Bites and scratches when handling animals
#Handling of blood and other potentially hazardous pathological materials
#Decontamination and disposal of infectious material.

== Biosafety management in laboratory ==
First of all the laboratory director, who holds immediate responsibility for the laboratory, is tasked with ensuring the development and adoption of a biosafety management plan as well as a safety or operations manual. Secondly, the laboratory supervisor, who reports to the laboratory director, is responsible for organizing regular training sessions on laboratory safety.

The third point, the personnel must be informed about any special hazards and be required to review the safety or operations manual and adhere to established practices and procedures. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring that all personnel have a clear understanding of these guidelines, and a copy of the safety or operations manual should be readily available within the laboratory. Finally, adequate medical assessment, monitoring, and treatment must be made available to all personnel when needed, and comprehensive medical records should be maintained.

==Policy and practice in the United States==

===Legal information===
In June 2009, the Trans-Federal Task Force on Optimizing Biosafety and Biocontainment Oversight recommended the formation of an agency to coordinate high safety risk level labs (3 and 4), and voluntary, non-punitive measures for incident reporting. However, it is unclear as to what changes may or may not have been implemented following their recommendations.

====United States Code of Federal Regulations====

The United States Code of Federal Regulations is the codification (law), or collection of laws specific to a specific to a jurisdiction that represent broad areas subject to federal regulation. Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations addresses laws concerning Public Health issues including biosafety which can be found under the citation 42 CFR 73 to 42 CFR 73.21 by accessing the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) website.

Title 42 Section 73 of the CFR addresses specific aspects of biosafety including occupational safety and health, transportation of biohazardous materials and safety plans for laboratories using potential biohazards. While biocontainment, as defined in the Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories and Primary Containment for Biohazards: Selection, Installation and Use of Biosafety Cabinets manuals available at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website much of the design, implementation and monitoring of protocols are left up to state and local authorities.
The United States CFR states &quot;An individual or entity required to register [as a user of biological agents] must develop and implement a written biosafety plan that is commensurate with the risk of the select agent or toxin&quot; which is followed by three recommended sources for laboratory reference:

#The CDC/NIH publication, &quot;Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories.&quot;
#The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations in 29 CFR parts 1910.1200 and 1910.1450.
#The &quot;NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules&quot; (NIH Guidelines).

While clearly the needs of biocontainment and biosafety measures vary across government, academic and private industry laboratories, biological agents pose similar risks independent of their locale. Laws relating to biosafety are not easily accessible and there are few federal regulations that are readily available for a potential trainee to reference outside of the publications recommended in 42 CFR 73.12. Therefore, training is the responsibility of lab employers and is not consistent across various laboratory types thereby increasing the risk of accidental release of biological hazards that pose serious health threats to the humans, animals and the ecosystem as a whole.

====Agency guidance====

Many government agencies have made guidelines and recommendations in an effort to increase biosafety measures across laboratories in the United States. Agencies involved in producing policies surrounding biosafety within a hospital, pharmacy or clinical research laboratory include: the CDC, FDA, USDA, DHHS, DoT, EPA and potentially other local organizations including public health departments. The federal government does set some standards and recommendations for States to meet their standards, most of which fall under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. but currently, there is no single federal regulating agency directly responsible for ensuring the safety of biohazardous handling, storage, identification, clean-up and disposal. In addition to the CDC, the Environmental Protection Agency has some of the most accessible information on ecological impacts of biohazards, how to handle spills, reporting guidelines and proper disposal of agents dangerous to the environment. Many of these agencies have their own manuals and guidance documents relating to training and certain aspects of biosafety directly tied to their agency&#x27;s scope, including transportation, storage and handling of blood borne pathogens (OSHA, IATA). The American Biological Safety Association (ABSA) has a list of such agencies and links to their websites, along with links to publications and guidance documents to assist in risk assessment, lab design and adherence to laboratory exposure control plans. Many of these agencies were members of the 2009 Task Force on BioSafety. There was also a formation of a Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, but this is more concerned with national defense programs and biosecurity.

Ultimately states and local governments, as well as private industry labs, are left to make the final determinants for their own biosafety programs, which vary widely in scope and enforcement across the United States. Not all state programs address biosafety from all necessary perspectives, which should not just include personal safety, but also emphasize an full understanding among laboratory personnel of quality control and assurance, exposure potential impacts on the environment, and general public safety.

Toby Ord puts into question whether the current international conventions regarding biotechnology research and development regulation, and self-regulation by biotechnology companies and the scientific community are adequate.

State occupational safety plans are often focused on transportation, disposal, and risk assessment, allowing caveats for safety audits, but ultimately leaves the training in the hands of the employer. 22 states have approved Occupational Safety plans by OSHA that are audited annually for effectiveness. These plans apply to private and public sector workers, and not necessarily state/ government workers, and not all specifically have a comprehensive program for all aspects of biohazard management from start to finish. Sometimes biohazard management plans are limited only to workers in transportation specific job titles. The enforcement and training on such regulations can vary from lab to lab based on the State&#x27;s plans for occupational health and safety. With the exception of DoD lab personnel, CDC lab personnel, First responders, and DoT employees, enforcement of training is inconsistent, and while training is required to be done, specifics on the breadth and frequency of refresher training does not seem consistent from state to state; penalties may never be assessed without larger regulating bodies being aware of non-compliance, and enforcement is limited.

==== Medical waste management in the United States ====

Medical waste management was identified as an issue in the 1980s, with the Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988 becoming the new standard in biohazard waste disposal.

Although the Federal Government, EPA &amp; DOT provide some oversight of regulated medical waste storage, transportation, and disposal the majority of biohazard medical waste is regulated at the state level. Each state is responsible for regulation and management of their own biohazardous waste with each state varying in their regulatory process. Record keeping of biohazardous waste also varies between states.

Medical healthcare centers, hospitals veterinary clinics, clinical laboratories and other facilities generate over one million tons of waste each year. Although the majority of this waste is as harmless as common household waste, as much as 15 percent of this waste poses a potential infection hazard, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Medical waste is required to be rendered non-infectious before it can be disposed of. There are several different methods to treat and dispose of biohazardous waste. In the United States, the primary methods for treatment and disposal of biohazard, medical and sharps waste may include:
* Incineration
* Microwave
* Autoclaves
* Mechanical/Chemical Disinfection
*Irradiation

Different forms of biohazardous wasted required different treatments for their proper waste management. This is determined largely be each states regulations. 
===Incidents of non-compliance and reform efforts===

The United States Government has made it clear that biosafety is to be taken very seriously. In 2014, incidents with anthrax and Ebola pathogens in CDC laboratories prompted the CDC director Tom Frieden to issue a moratorium for research with these types of select agents. An investigation concluded that there was a lack of adherence to safety protocols and &quot;inadequate safeguards&quot; in place. This indicated a lack of proper training or reinforcement of training and supervision on regular basis for lab personnel.

Following these incidents, the CDC established an External Laboratory Safety Workgroup (ELSW), and suggestions have been made to reform effectiveness of the Federal Select Agent Program. The White House issued a report on national biosafety priorities in 2015, outlining next steps for a national biosafety and security program, and addressed biological safety needs for health research, national defense, and public safety.

In 2016, the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) had a presentation at their annual meeting focused on improving biosafety culture. This same year, The UPMC Center for Health Security issued a case study report including reviews of ten different nations&#x27; current biosafety regulations, including the United States. Their goal was to &quot;provide a foundation for identifying national-level biosafety norms and enable initial assessment of biosafety priorities necessary for developing effective national biosafety regulation and oversight.&quot;

<text>Biosecurity refers to measures aimed at preventing the introduction or spread of harmful organisms (e.g. viruses, bacteria, plants, animals etc.) intentionally or unintentionally outside their native range or within new environments. In agriculture, these measures are aimed at protecting food crops and livestock from pests, invasive species, and other organisms not conducive to the welfare of the human population. The term includes biological threats to people, including those from pandemic diseases and bioterrorism. The definition has sometimes been broadened to embrace other concepts, and it is used for different purposes in different contexts.

The COVID-19 pandemic is a recent example of a threat for which biosecurity measures have been needed in all countries of the world.

==Background and terminology==
The term &quot;biosecurity&quot; has been defined differently by various disciplines. The term was first used by the agricultural and environmental communities to describe preventative measures against threats from naturally occurring diseases and pests, later expanded to introduced species. Australia and New Zealand, among other countries, had incorporated this definition within their legislation by 2010. New Zealand was the earliest adopter of a comprehensive approach with its Biosecurity Act 1993. In 2001, the US National Association of State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA) defined biosecurity as &quot;the sum of risk management practices in defense against biological threats&quot;, and its main goal as &quot;protect[ing] against the risk posed by disease and organisms&quot;.

In 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) provided an information note describing biosecurity as a strategic and integrated approach to analysing and managing relevant risks to human, animal and plant life and health and associated risks for the environment. In another document, it describes the aim of biosecurity being &quot;to enhance the ability to protect human health, agricultural production systems, and the people and industries that depend on them&quot;, with the overarching goal being &quot;to prevent, control and/or manage risks to life and health as appropriate to the particular biosecurity sector&quot;.

Measures taken to counter biosecurity risks typically include compulsory terms of quarantine, and are put in place to minimise the risk of invasive pests or diseases arriving at a specific location that could damage crops and livestock as well as the wider environment.

In general, the term is today taken to include managing biological threats to people, industries or environment. These may be from foreign or endemic organisms, but they can also extend to pandemic diseases and the threat of bioterrorism, both of which pose threats to public health.

===Laboratory biosafety and intentional harm===
The definition has sometimes been broadened to embrace other concepts, and it is used for different purposes in different contexts. It can be defined as the &quot;successful minimising of the risks that the biological sciences will be deliberately or accidentally misused in a way which causes harm for humans, animals, plants or the environment, including through awareness and understanding of the risks&quot;.

From the late 1990s, in response to the threat of biological terrorism, the term started to include the prevention of the theft of biological materials from research laboratories, called &quot;laboratory biosecurity&quot; by WHO. The term laboratory biosafety refers to the measures taken &quot;to reduce the risk of accidental release of or exposure to infectious disease agents&quot;, whereas laboratory biosecurity is usually taken to mean &quot;a set of systems and practices employed in legitimate bioscience facilities to reduce the risk that dangerous biological agents will be stolen and used maliciously&quot;. Joseph Kanabrocki (2017) source elaborates: &quot;Biosafety focuses on protection of the researcher, their contacts and the environment via accidental release of a pathogen from containment, whether by direct release into the environment or by a laboratory-acquired infection. Conversely, biosecurity focuses on controlling access to pathogens of consequence and on the reliability of the scientists granted this access (thereby reducing the threat of an intentional release of a pathogen) and/or access to sensitive information related to a pathogen&#x27;s virulence, host-range, transmissibility, resistance to medical countermeasures, and environmental stability, among other things&quot;.

In the US, the National Science Advisory Board on Biosecurity was created in 2004 to provide biosecurity oversight of &quot;dual-use research&quot;, defined as &quot;biological research with legitimate scientific purpose that may be misused to pose a biological threat to public health and/or national security&quot;. In 2006, the National Academy of Sciences defined biosecurity as &quot;security against the inadvertent, inappropriate, or intentional malicious or malevolent use of potentially dangerous biological agents or biotechnology, including the development, production, stockpiling, or use of biological weapons as well as outbreaks of newly emergent and epidemic disease&quot;.

A number of nations have developed biological weapons for military use, and many civilian research projects in medicine have the potential to be used in military applications (dual-use research), so biosecurity protocols are used to prevent dangerous biological materials from falling into the hands of malevolent parties.

===Laboratory program===
Components of a laboratory biosecurity program include:
* Physical security
* Personnel security
* Material control and accountability
* Transport security
* Information security
* Program management
* Biological Security

==Animals and plants==

Threats to animals and plants, in particular food crops, which may in turn threaten human health, are typically overseen by a government department of agriculture.

Animal biosecurity encompasses different means of prevention and containment of disease agents in a specific area. A critical element in animal biosecurity is biocontainment – the control of disease agents already present in a particular area and work to prevent transmission. Animal biosecurity may protect organisms from infectious agents or noninfectious agents such as toxins or pollutants, and can be executed in areas as large as a nation or as small as a local farm.

Animal biosecurity takes into account the epidemiological triad for disease occurrence: the individual host, the disease, and the environment in contributing to disease susceptibility. It aims to improve nonspecific immunity of the host to resist the introduction of an agent, or limit the risk that an agent will be sustained in an environment at adequate levels. Biocontainment works to improve specific immunity towards already present pathogens.

The aquaculture industry is also vulnerable to pathogenic organisms, including fungal, bacterial, or viral infections which can affect fish at different stages of their life cycle.

==Human health==
Direct threats to human health may come in the form of epidemics or pandemics, such as the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic and other influenza epidemics, MERS, SARS, or the COVID-19 pandemic, or they may be deliberate attacks (bioterrorism). The country/federal and/or state health departments are usually responsible for managing the control of outbreaks and transmission and the supply of information to the public.

===Medical countermeasures===
Medical countermeasures (MCMs) are products such as biologics and pharmaceutical drugs that can protect from or treat the effects of a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) attack or in the case of public health emergencies. MCMs can also be used for prevention and diagnosis of symptoms associated with CBRN attacks or threats.

In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) runs a program called the &quot;FDA Medical Countermeasures Initiative&quot; (MCMi), with programs funded by the federal government. It helps support &quot;partner&quot; agencies and organisations prepare for public health emergencies that could require MCMs.

==International agreements and guidelines==
===Agricultural biosecurity and human health===
Various international organisations, international bodies and legal instruments and agreements make up a worldwide governance framework for biosecurity.

Standard-setting organisations include the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures (CPM) develop standards pertinent to their focuses, which then become international reference points through the World Trade Organization (WTO)&#x27;s Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement), created in 1995. This agreement requires all members of the WTO to consider all import requests concerning agricultural products from other countries. Broadly, the measures covered by the agreement are those aimed at the protection of human, animal or plant life or health from certain risks.

Other important global and regional agreements include the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005), the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC), the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, the Codex Alimentarius, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT, 1947).

The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and WHO are the most important organisations associated with biosecurity.

The IHR is a legally binding agreement on 196 nations, including all member states of WHO. Its purpose and scope is &quot;to prevent, protect against, control, and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks and that avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade&quot;, &quot;to help the international community prevent and respond to acute public health risks that have the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwide&quot;.

===Biological weapons===
* The Biological Weapons Convention was the first multilateral disarmament treaty banning the production of an entire category of weapons, being biological weapons.
* &quot;UN Resolution 1540&quot; (2004) &quot;affirms that the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and their means of delivery constitutes a threat to international peace and security. The resolution obliges States, inter alia, to refrain from supporting by any means non-State actors from developing, acquiring, manufacturing, possessing, transporting, transferring or using nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and their means of delivery&quot;. Resolution 2325, reaffirming 1540, was adopted unanimously on 15 December 2016.

===Laboratory safety===
*&quot;OECD Best Practice Guidelines for Biological Resource Centres&quot;, a consensus report created in 2001 after experts from OECD countries came together, calling upon &quot;national governments to undertake actions to bring the BRC concept into being in concert with the international scientific community&quot;. BRCs are &quot;repositories and providers of high-quality biological materials and information&quot;.

==As international security issue==
For a long time, health security or biosecurity issues were not considered as an international security issue, especially in the traditional view of international relations. However, some changes in trend have contributed to the inclusion of biosecurity (health security) in discussions of security. As time progressed, there was a movement towards securitisation. Non-traditional security issues such as climate change, organised crime, terrorism, and landmines came to be included in the definition of international security. There was a general realisation that the actors in the international system not only involved nation-states but also included international organisations, institutions, and individuals, which ensured the security of various actors within each nation became an important agenda. Biosecurity is one of the issues to be securitised under this trend. On 10 January 2000, the UN Security Council convened to discuss HIV/AIDS as a security issue in Africa and designated it a threat in the following month. The UNDP Millennium Development Goals also recognise health issues as international security issue.

Several instances of epidemics such as SARS increased awareness of health security (biosecurity). Several factors have rendered biosecurity issues more severe: there is a continuing advancement of biotechnology, which increases the possibility for malevolent use, evolution of infectious diseases, and globalising force which is making the world more interdependent and more susceptible to spread of epidemics.

Controversial experiments in synthetic biology, including the synthesis of poliovirus from its genetic sequence, and the modification of flu type H5N1 for airborne transmission in mammals, led to calls for tighter controls on the materials and information used to perform similar feats. Ideas include better enforcement by national governments and private entities concerning shipments and downloads of such materials, and registration or background check requirements for anyone handling such materials.

==Challenges==
Diseases caused by emerging viruses are a major threat to global public health. The proliferation of high biosafety level laboratories around the world has resulted in concern about the availability of targets for those that might be interested in stealing dangerous pathogens. The growth in containment laboratories is often in response to emerging diseases, and many new containment labs&#x27; main focus is to find ways to control these diseases. By strengthening national disease surveillance, prevention, control and response systems, the labs have improved international public health.

One of the major challenges of biosecurity is that harmful technology has become more available and accessible. Biomedical advances and the globalisation of scientific and technical expertise have made it possible to greatly improve public health; however, there is also the risk that these advances can make it easier for terrorists to produce biological weapons.

Communication between the citizen and law enforcement officials is important. Indicators of agro-terrorism at a food processing plant may include persons taking notes or photos of a business, theft of employee uniforms, employees changing working hours, or persons attempting to gain information about security measures and personnel. Unusual activity is best handled if reported to law enforcement personnel promptly. Communication between policymakers and life sciences scientists is also important.

The MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region, with its socio-political unrest, diverse cultures and societies, and recent biological weapons programs, faces particular challenges.

===Future===

Biosecurity requires the cooperation of scientists, technicians, policy makers, security engineers, and law enforcement officials.

The emerging nature of newer biosecurity threats means that small-scale risks can blow up rapidly, which makes the development of an effective policy challenging owing to the limitations on time and resources available for analysing threats and estimating the likelihood of their occurrence. It is likely that further synergies with other disciplines, such as virology or the detection of chemical contaminants, will develop over time.

Some uncertainties about the policy implementation for biosecurity remain for future. In order to carefully plan out preventive policies, policy makers need to be able to somewhat predict the probability and assess the risks; however, as the uncertain nature of the biosecurity issue goes it is largely difficult to predict and also involves a complex process as it requires a multidisciplinary approach. The policy choices they make to address an immediate threat could pose another threat in the future, facing an unintended trade-off.

Philosopher Toby Ord, in his 2020 book &quot;The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity&quot;, puts into question whether the current international conventions regarding biotechnology research and development regulation, and self-regulation by biotechnology companies and the scientific community are adequate.

American scientists have proposed various policy-based measures to reduce the large risks from life sciences research – such as pandemics through accident or misapplication. Risk management measures may include novel international guidelines, effective oversight, improvement of US policies to influence policies globally, and identification of gaps in biosecurity policies along with potential approaches to address them.

Researchers have also warned in 2024 of potential risks from mirror life, a hypothetical form of life whose molecular building blocks have inverted chirality. If mirror bacteria were synthesized, they may be able to evade immune systems and spread in the environment without natural predators. They noted that the technology to create mirror bacteria was still probably more than a decade away, but called for a ban on research aiming to create them.

=== Role of education ===
The advance of the life sciences and biotechnology has the potential to bring great benefits to humankind through responding to societal challenges. However, it is also possible that such advances could be exploited for hostile purposes, something evidenced in a small number of incidents of bioterrorism, particularly by the series of large-scale offensive biological warfare programs carried out by major states in the last century. Dealing with this challenge, which has been labelled the &quot;dual-use dilemma&quot;, requires a number of different activities. However, one way of ensuring that the life sciences continue to generate significant benefits and do not become subject to misuse for hostile purposes is a process of engagement between scientists and the security community, and the development of strong ethical and normative frameworks to complement legal and regulatory measures that are developed by states.

<doc id="45265" wikidata="Q2248459" url="?curid=45265" title="De Bruijn–Newman constant">
<text>The de Bruijn–Newman constant, denoted by formula_1 and named after Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn and Charles Michael Newman, is a mathematical constant defined via the zeros of a certain function formula_2, where formula_3 is a real parameter and formula_4 is a complex variable. More precisely,
:formula_5,
where formula_6 is the super-exponentially decaying function
:formula_7
and formula_1 is the unique real number with the property that formula_9 has only real zeros if and only if formula_10.

The constant is closely connected with Riemann hypothesis. Indeed, the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the conjecture that formula_11. Brad Rodgers and Terence Tao proved that formula_12, so the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to formula_13. A simplified proof of the Rodgers–Tao result was later given by Alexander Dobner.

== History ==
De Bruijn showed in 1950 that formula_9 has only real zeros if formula_15, and moreover, that if formula_9 has only real zeros for some formula_3, formula_9 also has only real zeros if formula_3 is replaced by any larger value. Newman proved in 1976 the existence of a constant formula_1 for which the &quot;if and only if&quot; claim holds; and this then implies that formula_1 is unique. Newman also conjectured that formula_12, which was proven forty years later, by Brad Rodgers and Terence Tao in 2018.

== Upper bounds ==
De Bruijn&#x27;s upper bound of formula_23 was not improved until 2008, when Ki, Kim and Lee proved formula_24, making the inequality strict.

In December 2018, the 15th Polymath project improved the bound to formula_25. A manuscript of the Polymath work was submitted to arXiv in late April 2019, and was published in the journal Research In the Mathematical Sciences in August 2019.

This bound was further slightly improved in April 2020 by Platt and Trudgian to formula_26.

<text>A measure space is a basic object of measure theory, a branch of mathematics that studies generalized notions of volumes. It contains an underlying set, the subsets of this set that are feasible for measuring (the -algebra) and the method that is used for measuring (the measure). One important example of a measure space is a probability space.

A measurable space consists of the first two components without a specific measure.

==Definition==

A measure space is a triple formula_1 where
* formula_2 is a set
* formula_3 is a -algebra on the set formula_2
* formula_5 is a measure on formula_6

In other words, a measure space consists of a measurable space formula_6 together with a measure on it.

==Example==

Set formula_8. The formula_9-algebra on finite sets such as the one above is usually the power set, which is the set of all subsets (of a given set) and is denoted by formula_10 Sticking with this convention, we set
formula_11

In this simple case, the power set can be written down explicitly:
formula_12

As the measure, define formula_13 by 
formula_14
so formula_15 (by additivity of measures) and formula_16 (by definition of measures).

This leads to the measure space formula_17 It is a probability space, since formula_18 The measure formula_13 corresponds to the Bernoulli distribution with formula_20 which is for example used to model a fair coin flip.

==Important classes of measure spaces==

Most important classes of measure spaces are defined by the properties of their associated measures. This includes, in order of increasing generality:
* Probability spaces, a measure space where the measure is a probability measure
* Finite measure spaces, where the measure is a finite measure
* formula_21-finite measure spaces, where the measure is a formula_22-finite measure

Another class of measure spaces are the complete measure spaces.

<doc id="45273" wikidata="Q862372" url="?curid=45273" title="Infinite loop">
<text>In computer programming, an infinite loop (or endless loop) is a sequence of instructions that, as written, will continue endlessly, unless an external intervention occurs, such as turning off power via a switch or pulling a plug. It may be intentional.

There is no general algorithm to determine whether a computer program contains an infinite loop or not; this is the halting problem. 

==Overview==
This differs from &quot;a type of computer program that runs the same instructions continuously until it is either stopped or interrupted&quot;. Consider the following pseudocode:

how_many = 0
while is_there_more_data() do
 how_many = how_many + 1
end
display &quot;the number of items counted = &quot; how_many
&quot;The same instructions&quot; were run &quot;continuously until it was stopped or interrupted&quot; . . . by the &quot;FALSE&quot; returned at some point by the function &quot;is_there_more_data&quot;.

By contrast, the following loop will not end by itself:

birds = 1
fish = 2
while birds + fish &gt; 1 do
 birds = 3 - birds
 fish = 3 - fish
end
&quot;birds&quot; will alternate being 1 or 2, while &quot;fish&quot; will alternate being 2 or 1. The loop will not stop unless an external intervention occurs (&quot;pull the plug&quot;).

==Details==
An &quot;infinite loop&quot; is a sequence of instructions in a computer program which loops endlessly, either due to the loop having no terminating condition, having one that can never be met, or one that causes the loop to start over. In older operating systems with cooperative multitasking, infinite loops normally caused the entire system to become unresponsive. With the now-prevalent preemptive multitasking model, infinite loops usually cause the program to consume all available processor time, but can usually be terminated by a user. Busy wait loops are also sometimes called &quot;infinite loops&quot;. Infinite loops are one possible cause for a computer hanging or freezing; others include thrashing, deadlock, and access violations.

==Intended vs unintended looping==
Looping is repeating a set of instructions until a specific condition is met. An infinite loop occurs when the condition will never be met due to some inherent characteristic of the loop.

===Intentional looping===
There are a few situations when this is desired behavior. For example, the games on cartridge-based game consoles typically have no exit condition in their main loop, as there is no operating system for the program to exit to; the loop runs until the console is powered off.

Modern interactive computers require that the computer constantly be monitoring for user input or device activity, so at some fundamental level there is an infinite processing idle loop that must continue until the device is turned off or reset. In the Apollo Guidance Computer, for example, this outer loop was contained in the Exec program, and if the computer had absolutely no other work to do, it would loop run a dummy job that would simply turn off the &quot;computer activity&quot; indicator light.

Modern computers also typically do not halt the processor or motherboard circuit-driving clocks when they crash. Instead they fall back to an error condition displaying messages to the operator (such as the blue screen of death), and enter an infinite loop waiting for the user to either respond to a prompt to continue, or reset the device.

==== Spinlocks ====
Spinlocks are low-level synchronization mechanisms used in concurrent programming to protect shared resources. Unlike traditional locks that put a thread to sleep when it can&#x27;t acquire the lock, spinlocks repeatedly &quot;spin&quot; in an infinite loop until the lock becomes available. This intentional infinite looping is a deliberate design choice aimed at minimizing the time a thread spends waiting for the lock and avoiding the overhead of higher level synchronisation mechanisms such as mutexes.

====Multi-threading====
In multi-threaded programs some threads can be executing inside infinite loops without causing the entire program to be stuck in an infinite loop. If the main thread exits, all threads of the process are forcefully stopped, thus all execution ends and the process/program terminates. The threads inside the infinite loops can perform &quot;housekeeping&quot; tasks or they can be in a blocked state waiting for input (from socket/queue) and resume execution every time input is received.

===Unintentional looping===

Most often, the term is used for those situations when this is not the intended result; that is, when this is a bug. Such errors are most common by novice programmers, but can be made by experienced programmers also, because their causes can be quite subtle.

One common cause, for example, is that a programmer intends to iterate over sequence of nodes in a data structure such as a linked list or tree, executing the loop code once for each node. Improperly formed links can create a &quot;reference loop&quot; in the data structure, where one node links to another that occurs earlier in the sequence. This makes part of the data structure into a ring, causing naive code to loop forever.

While most infinite loops can be found by close inspection of the code, there is no general method to determine whether a given program will ever halt or will run forever; this is the undecidability of the halting problem.

==Interruption==
As long as the system is responsive, infinite loops can often be interrupted by sending a signal to the process (such as SIGINT in Unix), or an interrupt to the processor, causing the current process to be aborted. This can be done in a task manager, in a terminal with the Control-C command, or by using the kill command or system call. However, this does not always work, as the process may not be responding to signals or the processor may be in an uninterruptible state, such as in the Cyrix coma bug (caused by overlapping uninterruptible instructions in an instruction pipeline). In some cases other signals such as SIGKILL can work, as they do not require the process to be responsive, while in other cases the loop cannot be terminated short of system shutdown.

==Language support==

Infinite loops can be implemented using various control flow constructs. Most commonly, in unstructured programming this is jump back up (goto), while in structured programming this is an indefinite loop (while loop) set to never end, either by omitting the condition or explicitly setting it to true, as codice_1.

Some languages have special constructs for infinite loops, typically by omitting the condition from an indefinite loop. Examples include Ada (codice_2), Fortran (codice_3), Go (codice_4), Ruby (codice_5), and Rust (codice_6).

==Examples of intentional infinite loops==
A simple example (in C):
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
 for (;;) // or equivalently, while (1)
 printf(&quot;Infinite Loop\n&quot;); 
 return 0;

The form codice_7 for an infinite loop is traditional, appearing in the standard reference &quot;The C Programming Language&quot;, and is often punningly pronounced &quot;forever&quot;.

This is a loop that will print &quot;Infinite Loop&quot; without halting.

A similar example in 1980s-era BASIC:

10 PRINT &quot;INFINITE LOOP&quot;
20 GOTO 10
A similar example in DOS batch files:

:A
echo Infinite Loop
goto :A

Here the loop is quite obvious, as the last line unconditionally sends execution back to the first.

An example in Java:

while (true) {
 System.out.println(&quot;Infinite Loop&quot;);


The while loop never terminates because its condition is always true.

An example in Bourne Again Shell:

for ((;;)); do
 echo &quot;Infinite Loop&quot;
done
An example in Rust:

loop {
 println!(&quot;Infinite loop&quot;);


==Examples of unintentional infinite loops==

===Mathematical errors===
Here is one example of an infinite loop in Visual Basic:

dim x as integer
do while x &lt; 5
 x = 1
 x = x + 1
loop
This creates a situation where codice_8 will never be greater than 5, since at the start of the loop code, codice_8 is assigned the value of 1 (regardless of any previous value) before it is changed to codice_8 + 1. Thus the loop will always result in codice_8 = 2 and will never break. This could be fixed by moving the codice_12 instruction outside the loop so that its initial value is set only once.

In some languages, programmer confusion about mathematical symbols may lead to an unintentional infinite loop. For example, here is a snippet in C:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
 int a = 0;
 while (a &lt; 10) {
 printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, a);
 if (a = 5)
 printf(&quot;a equals 5!\n&quot;);
 a++;
 return 0;


The expected output is the numbers 0 through 9, with an interjected &quot;a equals 5!&quot; between 5 and 6. However, in the line &quot;codice_13&quot; above, the = (assignment) operator was confused with the == (equality test) operator. Instead, this will assign the value of 5 to codice_14 at this point in the program. Thus, codice_14 will never be able to advance to 10, and this loop cannot terminate.

===Rounding errors===
Unexpected behavior in evaluating the terminating condition can also cause this problem. Here is an example in C:
float x = 0.1;
while (x != 1.1) {
 printf(&quot;x = %22.20f\n&quot;, x);
 x += 0.1;


On some systems, this loop will execute ten times as expected, but on other systems it will never terminate. The problem is that the loop terminating condition codice_16 tests for exact equality of two floating point values, and the way floating point values are represented in many computers will make this test fail, because they cannot represent the value 0.1 exactly, thus introducing rounding errors on each increment (cf. box).

The same can happen in Python:

x = 0.1
while x != 1:
 print(x)
 x += 0.1
Because of the likelihood of tests for equality or not-equality failing unexpectedly, it is safer to use greater-than or less-than tests when dealing with floating-point values. For example, instead of testing whether codice_8 equals 1.1, one might test whether codice_18, or codice_19, either of which would be certain to exit after a finite number of iterations. Another way to fix this particular example would be to use an integer as a loop index, counting the number of iterations that have been performed.

A similar problem occurs frequently in numerical analysis: in order to compute a certain result, an iteration is intended to be carried out until the error is smaller than a chosen tolerance. However, because of rounding errors during the iteration, the specified tolerance can never be reached, resulting in an infinite loop.

==Multi-party loops==
An infinite loop may be caused by several entities interacting. Consider a server that always replies with an error message if it does not understand the request. Even if there is no possibility for an infinite loop within the server itself, a system comprising two of them (&quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;) may loop endlessly: if &quot;A&quot; receives a message of unknown type from &quot;B&quot;, then &quot;A&quot; replies with an error message to &quot;B&quot;; if &quot;B&quot; does not understand the error message, it replies to &quot;A&quot; with its own error message; if &quot;A&quot; does not understand the error message from &quot;B&quot;, it sends yet another error message, and so on.

One common example of such situation is an email loop. An example of an email loop is if someone receives mail from a no reply inbox, but their auto-response is on. They will reply to the no reply inbox, triggering the &quot;this is a no reply inbox&quot; response. This will be sent to the user, who then sends an auto reply to the no-reply inbox, and so on and so forth.

==Pseudo-infinite loops==
A pseudo-infinite loop is a loop that appears infinite but is really just a very long loop.

===Very large numbers===
An example in bash:

for x in $(seq 1000000000); do
#loop code
done
===Impossible termination condition===
An example for loop in C:

unsigned int i;
for (i = 1; i != 0; i++) {
 /* loop code */

It appears that this will go on indefinitely, but in fact the value of codice_20 will eventually reach the maximum value storable in an codice_21 and adding 1 to that number will wrap-around to 0, breaking the loop. The actual limit of codice_20 depends on the details of the system and compiler used. With arbitrary-precision arithmetic, this loop would continue until the computer&#x27;s memory could no longer hold codice_20. If codice_20 was a signed integer, rather than an unsigned integer, overflow would be undefined. In this case, the compiler could optimize the code into an infinite loop.

===Infinite recursion===

Infinite recursion is a special case of an infinite loop that is caused by recursion. 

The following example in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) returns a stack overflow error:

Sub Test1()
 Call Test1
End Sub
===Break statement===
A &quot;codice_25&quot; loop looks infinite at first glance, but there may be a way to escape the loop through a break statement or return statement.
Example in PHP:

while (true) {
 if ($foo-&gt;bar()) {
 return;
}
===Alderson loop===
&quot;Alderson loop&quot; is a rare slang or jargon term for an infinite loop where there is an exit condition available, but inaccessible in an implementation of the code, typically due to a programmer error. These are most common and visible while debugging user interface code.

A C-like pseudocode example of an Alderson loop, where the program is supposed to sum numbers given by the user until zero is given, but where the wrong operator is used:

int sum = 0;
int i;
while (true) {
 printf(&quot;Input a number to add to the sum or 0 to quit&quot;);
 i = getUserInput();
 if (i * 0) { // if i times 0 is true, add i to the sum. Note: ZERO means FALSE, Non-Zero means TRUE. &quot;i * 0&quot; is ZERO (FALSE)!
 sum += i; // sum never changes because (i * 0) is 0 for any i; it would change if we had != in the condition instead of *
 if (sum &gt; 100) {
 break; // terminate the loop; exit condition exists but is never reached because sum is never added to
}
The term allegedly received its name from a programmer (whose last name is Alderson) who in 1996 had coded a modal dialog box in Microsoft Access without either an OK or Cancel button, thereby disabling the entire program whenever the box came up.

<doc id="45280" wikidata="Q212692" url="?curid=45280" title="Arthur Sullivan">
<text>Sir Arthur Seymour Sullivan (13 May 1842 – 22 November 1900) was an English composer. He is best known for 14 operatic collaborations with the dramatist W. S. Gilbert, including &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; and &quot;The Mikado&quot;. His works include 24 operas, 11 major orchestral works, ten choral works and oratorios, two ballets, incidental music to several plays, and numerous church pieces, songs, and piano and chamber pieces. His hymns and songs include &quot;Onward, Christian Soldiers&quot; and &quot;The Lost Chord&quot;.

The son of a military bandmaster, Sullivan composed his first anthem at the age of eight and was later a soloist in the boys&#x27; choir of the Chapel Royal. In 1856, at 14, he was awarded the first Mendelssohn Scholarship by the Royal Academy of Music, which allowed him to study at the academy and then at the Leipzig Conservatoire in Germany. His graduation piece, incidental music to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot; (1861), was received with acclaim on its first performance in London. Among his early major works were a ballet, &quot;L&#x27;Île Enchantée&quot; (1864), a symphony, a cello concerto (both 1866), and his &quot;Overture di Ballo&quot; (1870). To supplement the income from his concert works he wrote hymns, parlour ballads and other light pieces, and worked as a church organist and music teacher.

In 1866 Sullivan composed a one-act comic opera, &quot;Cox and Box&quot;, which is still widely performed. He wrote his first opera with W. S. Gilbert, &quot;Thespis&quot;, in 1871. Four years later, the impresario Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte engaged Gilbert and Sullivan to create a one-act piece, &quot;Trial by Jury&quot; (1875). Its box-office success led to a series of twelve full-length comic operas by the collaborators. After the extraordinary success of &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; (1878) and &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; (1879), Carte used his profits from the partnership to build the Savoy Theatre in 1881, and their joint works became known as the Savoy operas. Among the best known of the later operas are &quot;The Mikado&quot; (1885) and &quot;The Gondoliers&quot; (1889). Gilbert broke from Sullivan and Carte in 1890, after a quarrel over expenses at the Savoy. They reunited in the 1890s for two more operas, but these did not achieve the popularity of their earlier works.

Sullivan&#x27;s infrequent serious pieces during the 1880s included two cantatas, &quot;The Martyr of Antioch&quot; (1880) and &quot;The Golden Legend&quot; (1886), his most popular choral work. He also wrote incidental music for West End productions of several Shakespeare plays, and held conducting and academic appointments. Sullivan&#x27;s only grand opera, &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, though initially successful in 1891, has rarely been revived. In his last decade Sullivan continued to compose comic operas with various librettists and wrote other major and minor works. He died at the age of 58, regarded as Britain&#x27;s foremost composer. His comic opera style served as a model for generations of musical theatre composers that followed, and his music is still frequently performed, recorded and pastiched.

==Life and career==

===Beginnings===
Sullivan was born on 13 May 1842 in Lambeth, London, the younger of the two children, both boys, of Thomas Sullivan (1805–1866) and his wife, Mary Clementina &quot;née&quot; Coghlan (1811–1882). His father was a military bandmaster, clarinettist and music teacher, born in Ireland and raised in Chelsea, London; his mother was English born, of Irish and Italian descent. Thomas Sullivan was based from 1845 to 1857 at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where he was the bandmaster and taught music privately to supplement his income. Young Arthur became proficient with many of the instruments in the band and composed an anthem, &quot;By the Waters of Babylon&quot;, when he was eight. He later recalled:
While recognising the boy&#x27;s obvious talent, his father knew the insecurity of a musical career and discouraged him from pursuing it. Sullivan studied at a private school in Bayswater. In 1854 he persuaded his parents and the headmaster to allow him to apply for membership in the choir of the Chapel Royal. Despite concerns that, at nearly 12 years of age, Sullivan was too old to give much service as a treble before his voice broke, he was accepted and soon became a soloist. By 1856, he was promoted to &quot;first boy&quot;. Even at this age, his health was delicate, and he was easily fatigued.

Sullivan flourished under the training of the Reverend Thomas Helmore, Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal, and began to write anthems and songs. Helmore encouraged his compositional talent and arranged for one of his pieces, &quot;O Israel&quot;, to be published in 1855, his first published work. Helmore enlisted Sullivan&#x27;s assistance in creating harmonisations for a volume of &quot;The Hymnal Noted&quot; and arranged for the boy&#x27;s compositions to be performed; one anthem was performed at the Chapel Royal in St James&#x27;s Palace under the direction of Sir George Smart.

===Mendelssohn scholar===

In 1856 the Royal Academy of Music awarded the first Mendelssohn Scholarship to the 14-year-old Sullivan, granting him a year&#x27;s training at the academy. His principal teacher there was John Goss, whose own teacher, Thomas Attwood, had been a pupil of Mozart. He studied piano with William Sterndale Bennett (the future head of the academy) and Arthur O&#x27;Leary. During this first year at the academy Sullivan continued to sing solos with the Chapel Royal, which provided a small amount of spending money.

Sullivan&#x27;s scholarship was extended to a second year, and in 1858, in what his biographer Arthur Jacobs calls an &quot;extraordinary gesture of confidence&quot;, the scholarship committee extended his grant for a third year so that he could study in Germany, at the Leipzig Conservatoire. There, Sullivan studied composition with Julius Rietz and Carl Reinecke, counterpoint with Moritz Hauptmann and Ernst Richter, and the piano with Louis Plaidy and Ignaz Moscheles. He was trained in Mendelssohn&#x27;s ideas and techniques but was also exposed to a variety of styles, including those of Schubert, Verdi, Bach and Wagner. Visiting a synagogue, he was so struck by some of the cadences and progressions of the music that thirty years later he could recall them for use in his grand opera, &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;. He became friendly with the future impresario Carl Rosa and the violinist Joseph Joachim, among others.

The academy renewed Sullivan&#x27;s scholarship to allow him a second year of study at Leipzig. For his third and last year there, his father scraped together the money for living expenses, and the conservatoire assisted by waiving its fees. Sullivan&#x27;s graduation piece, completed in 1861, was a suite of incidental music to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;. Revised and expanded, it was performed at the Crystal Palace in 1862, a year after his return to London; &quot;The Musical Times&quot; described it as a sensation. He began building a reputation as England&#x27;s most promising young composer.

===Rising composer===

Sullivan embarked on his composing career with a series of ambitious works, interspersed with hymns, parlour songs and other light pieces in a more commercial vein. His compositions were not enough to support him financially, and between 1861 and 1872 he worked as a church organist, which he enjoyed; as a music teacher, which he hated and gave up as soon as he could; and as an arranger of vocal scores of popular operas. He took an early opportunity to compose several pieces for royalty in connection with the wedding of the Prince of Wales in 1863.

With &quot;The Masque at Kenilworth&quot; (Birmingham Festival, 1864), Sullivan began his association with works for voice and orchestra. While an organist at the Royal Italian Opera, Covent Garden, he composed his first ballet, &quot;L&#x27;Île Enchantée&quot; (1864). His &quot;&quot;Irish&quot; Symphony&quot; and &quot;Cello Concerto&quot; (both 1866) were his only works in their respective genres. In the same year, his Overture in C (&quot;In Memoriam&quot;), commemorating the recent death of his father, was a commission from the Norwich Festival. It achieved considerable popularity. In June 1867 the Philharmonic Society gave the first performance of his overture &quot;Marmion&quot;. The reviewer for &quot;The Times&quot; called it &quot;another step in advance on the part of the only composer of any remarkable promise that just at present we can boast.&quot; In October, Sullivan travelled with George Grove to Vienna in search of neglected scores by Schubert. They unearthed manuscript copies of symphonies and vocal music, and were particularly elated by their final discovery, the incidental music to &quot;Rosamunde&quot;.

Sullivan&#x27;s first attempt at opera, &quot;The Sapphire Necklace&quot; (1863–64) to a libretto by Henry F. Chorley, was not produced and is now lost, except for the overture and two songs that were separately published. His first surviving opera, &quot;Cox and Box&quot; (1866), was written for a private performance. It then received charity performances in London and Manchester, and was later produced at the Gallery of Illustration, where it ran for an extraordinary 264 performances. W. S. Gilbert, writing in &quot;Fun&quot; magazine, pronounced the score superior to F. C. Burnand&#x27;s libretto. Sullivan and Burnand were soon commissioned by Thomas German Reed for a two-act opera, &quot;The Contrabandista&quot; (1867; revised and expanded as &quot;The Chieftain&quot; in 1894), but it did not do as well. Among Sullivan&#x27;s early part songs is &quot;The Long Day Closes&quot; (1868). Sullivan&#x27;s last major work of the 1860s was a short oratorio, &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot;, first given in Worcester Cathedral as part of the 1869 Three Choirs Festival to much praise.

===1870s: first collaborations with Gilbert===

Sullivan&#x27;s most enduring orchestral work, the &quot;Overture di Ballo&quot;, was composed for the Birmingham Festival in 1870. The same year, Sullivan first met the poet and dramatist W. S. Gilbert. In 1871 Sullivan published his only song cycle, &quot;The Window&quot;, to words by Tennyson, and he wrote the first of a series of incidental music scores for productions of Shakespeare plays. He also composed a dramatic cantata, &quot;On Shore and Sea&quot;, for the opening of the London International Exhibition, and the hymn &quot;Onward, Christian Soldiers&quot;, with words by Sabine Baring-Gould. The Salvation Army adopted the latter as its favoured processional, and it became Sullivan&#x27;s best-known hymn.

At the end of 1871 John Hollingshead, proprietor of London&#x27;s Gaiety Theatre, commissioned Sullivan to work with Gilbert to create the burlesque-style comic opera &quot;Thespis&quot;. Played as a Christmas entertainment, it ran through to Easter 1872, a good run for such a piece. Gilbert and Sullivan then went their separate ways until they collaborated on three parlour ballads in late 1874 and early 1875.

Sullivan&#x27;s large-scale works of the early 1870s were the &quot;Festival Te Deum&quot; (Crystal Palace, 1872) and the oratorio &quot;The Light of the World&quot; (Birmingham Festival, 1873). He provided incidental music for productions of &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; at the Gaiety in 1874 and &quot;Henry VIII&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Manchester, in 1877. He continued to compose hymns throughout the decade. In 1873 Sullivan contributed songs to Burnand&#x27;s Christmas &quot;drawing room extravaganza&quot;, &quot;The Miller and His Man&quot;.

In 1875 the manager of the Royalty Theatre, Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte, needed a short piece to fill out a bill with Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;La Périchole&quot;. Carte had conducted Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Cox and Box&quot;. Remembering that Gilbert had suggested a libretto to him, Carte engaged Sullivan to set it, and the result was the one-act comic opera &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;. &quot;Trial&quot;, starring Sullivan&#x27;s brother Fred as the Learned Judge, became a surprise hit, earning glowing praise from the critics and playing for 300 performances over its first few seasons. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; commented that the piece illustrated the composer&#x27;s &quot;great capacity for dramatic writing of the lighter class&quot;, and other reviews emphasised the felicitous combination of Gilbert&#x27;s words and Sullivan&#x27;s music. One wrote, &quot;it seems, as in the great Wagnerian operas, as though poem and music had proceeded simultaneously from one and the same brain.&quot; A few months later, another Sullivan one-act comic opera opened: &quot;The Zoo&quot;, with a libretto by B. C. Stephenson. It was less successful than &quot;Trial&quot;, and for the next 15 years Sullivan&#x27;s sole operatic collaborator was Gilbert; the partners created a further twelve operas together.
Sullivan also turned out more than 80 popular songs and parlour ballads, most of them written before the end of the 1870s. His first popular song was &quot;Orpheus with his Lute&quot; (1866), and a well-received part song was &quot;Oh! Hush thee, my Babie&quot; (1867). The best known of his songs is &quot;The Lost Chord&quot; (1877, lyrics by Adelaide Anne Procter), written at the bedside of his brother during Fred&#x27;s last illness. The sheet music for his best-received songs sold in large numbers and was an important part of his income.
In this decade, Sullivan&#x27;s conducting appointments included the Glasgow Choral Union concerts (1875–77) and the Royal Aquarium Theatre, London (1876). In addition to his appointment as Professor of Composition at the Royal Academy of Music, of which he was a Fellow, he was appointed as the first Principal of the National Training School of Music in 1876. He accepted the latter post reluctantly, fearing that discharging the duties thoroughly would leave too little time for composing; in this he was correct. He was not effective in the post, and resigned in 1881.

Sullivan&#x27;s next collaboration with Gilbert, &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; (1877), ran for 178 performances, a success by the standards of the day, but &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; (1878), which followed it, turned Gilbert and Sullivan into an international phenomenon. Sullivan composed the bright and cheerful music of &quot;Pinafore&quot; while suffering from excruciating pain from a kidney stone. &quot;Pinafore&quot; ran for 571 performances in London, then the second-longest theatrical run in history, and more than 150 unauthorised productions were quickly mounted in America alone. Among other favourable reviews, &quot;The Times&quot; noted that the opera was an early attempt at the establishment of a &quot;national musical stage&quot; free from risqué French &quot;improprieties&quot; and without the &quot;aid&quot; of Italian and German musical models. &quot;The Times&quot; and several of the other papers agreed that although the piece was entertaining, Sullivan was capable of higher art, and frivolous light opera would hold him back. This criticism would follow Sullivan throughout his career.

In 1879 Sullivan suggested to a reporter from &quot;The New York Times&quot; the secret of his success with Gilbert: &quot;His ideas are as suggestive for music as they are quaint and laughable. His numbers ... always give me musical ideas.&quot; &quot;Pinafore&quot; was followed by &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; in 1879, which opened in New York and then ran in London for 363 performances.

===Early 1880s===

In 1880 Sullivan was appointed director of the triennial Leeds Music Festival. He had earlier been commissioned to write a sacred choral work for the festival and chose, as its subject, Henry Hart Milman&#x27;s 1822 dramatic poem based on the life and death of St Margaret of Antioch. &quot;The Martyr of Antioch&quot; was first performed at the Leeds Festival in October 1880. Gilbert adapted the libretto for Sullivan, who, in gratitude, presented his collaborator with an engraved silver cup inscribed &quot;W.S. Gilbert from his friend Arthur Sullivan.&quot; Sullivan was not a showy conductor, and some thought him dull and old-fashioned on the podium, but &quot;Martyr&quot; had an enthusiastic reception and was frequently revived. Other critics and performers had favorable reactions to Sullivan&#x27;s conducting, and he had a busy conducting career in parallel with his composing career, including seven Leeds Festivals among many other appointments. Sullivan invariably conducted the opening nights of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.

Carte opened the next Gilbert and Sullivan piece, &quot;Patience&quot;, in April 1881 at London&#x27;s Opera Comique, where their past three operas had played. In October, &quot;Patience&quot; transferred to the new, larger, state-of-the-art Savoy Theatre, built with the profits of the previous Gilbert and Sullivan works. The rest of the partnership&#x27;s collaborations were produced at the Savoy, and are widely known as the &quot;Savoy operas&quot;. &quot;Iolanthe&quot; (1882), the first new opera to open at the Savoy, was Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s fourth hit in a row. Sullivan, despite the financial security of writing for the Savoy, increasingly viewed the composition of comic operas as unimportant, beneath his skills, and also repetitious. After &quot;Iolanthe&quot;, Sullivan had not intended to write a new work with Gilbert, but he suffered a serious financial loss when his broker went bankrupt in November 1882. Therefore, he concluded that his financial needs obliged him to continue writing Savoy operas. In February 1883, he and Gilbert signed a five-year agreement with Carte, requiring them to produce a new comic opera on six months&#x27; notice.

On 22 May 1883 Sullivan was knighted by Queen Victoria for his &quot;services ... rendered to the promotion of the art of music&quot; in Britain. The musical establishment, and many critics, believed that this should end his career as a composer of comic opera – that a musical knight should not stoop below oratorio or grand opera. Having just signed the five-year agreement, Sullivan suddenly felt trapped. The next opera, &quot;Princess Ida&quot; (1884, the duo&#x27;s only three-act, blank verse work), had a shorter run than its four predecessors; Sullivan&#x27;s score was praised. With box office receipts lagging in March 1884, Carte gave the six months&#x27; notice, under the partnership contract, requiring a new opera. Sullivan&#x27;s close friend, the composer Frederic Clay, had recently suffered a career-ending stroke at the age of 45. Sullivan, reflecting on this, on his own long-standing kidney problems, and on his desire to devote himself to more serious music, replied to Carte, &quot;[I]t is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself.&quot;
Gilbert had already started work on a new opera in which the characters fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge. Sullivan wrote on 1 April 1884 that he had &quot;come to the end of my tether&quot; with the operas: &quot;I have been continually keeping down the music in order that not one [syllable] should be lost. ... I should like to set a story of human interest &amp; probability where the humorous words would come in a humorous (not serious) situation, &amp; where, if the situation were a tender or dramatic one the words would be of similar character.&quot; In a lengthy exchange of correspondence, Sullivan pronounced Gilbert&#x27;s plot sketch (particularly the &quot;lozenge&quot; element) unacceptably mechanical, and too similar in both its grotesque &quot;elements of topsyturveydom&quot; and in actual plot to their earlier work, especially &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;. He repeatedly requested that Gilbert find a new subject. The impasse was finally resolved on 8 May when Gilbert proposed a plot that did not depend on any supernatural device. The result was Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s most successful work, &quot;The Mikado&quot; (1885). The piece ran for 672 performances, which was the second-longest run for any work of musical theatre, and one of the longest runs of any theatre piece, up to that time.

===Later 1880s===

In 1886 Sullivan composed his second and last large-scale choral work of the decade. It was a cantata for the Leeds Festival, &quot;The Golden Legend&quot;, based on Longfellow&#x27;s poem of the same name. Apart from the comic operas, this proved to be Sullivan&#x27;s best received full-length work. It was given hundreds of performances during his lifetime, and at one point he declared a moratorium on its presentation, fearing that it would become over-exposed. Only Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; was performed more often in Britain in the 1880s and 1890s. It remained in the repertory until about the 1920s, but since then it has seldom been performed; it received its first professional recording in 2001. The musical scholar and conductor David Russell Hulme writes that the work influenced Elgar and Walton.

&quot;Ruddigore&quot; followed &quot;The Mikado&quot; at the Savoy in 1887. It was profitable, but its nine-month run was disappointing compared with most of the earlier Savoy operas. For their next piece, Gilbert submitted another version of the magic lozenge plot, which Sullivan again rejected. Gilbert finally proposed a comparatively serious opera, to which Sullivan agreed. Although it was not a grand opera, &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot; (1888) provided him with the opportunity to compose his most ambitious stage work to date. As early as 1883 Sullivan had been under pressure from the musical establishment to write a grand opera. In 1885 he told an interviewer, &quot;The opera of the future is a compromise [among the French, German and Italian schools] – a sort of eclectic school, a selection of the merits of each one. I myself will make an attempt to produce a grand opera of this new school. ... Yes, it will be an historical work, and it is the dream of my life.&quot; After &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot; opened, Sullivan turned again to Shakespeare, composing incidental music for Henry Irving&#x27;s Lyceum Theatre production of &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1888).

Sullivan wished to produce further serious works with Gilbert. He had collaborated with no other librettist since 1875. But Gilbert felt that the reaction to &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot; had &quot;not been so convincing as to warrant us in assuming that the public want something more earnest still&quot;. He proposed instead that Sullivan should go ahead with his plan to write a grand opera, but should continue also to compose comic works for the Savoy. Sullivan was not immediately persuaded. He replied, &quot;I have lost the liking for writing comic opera, and entertain very grave doubts as to my power of doing it.&quot; Nevertheless, Sullivan soon commissioned a grand opera libretto from Julian Sturgis (who was recommended by Gilbert), and suggested to Gilbert that he revive an old idea for an opera set in colourful Venice. The comic opera was completed first: &quot;The Gondoliers&quot; (1889) was a piece described by Gervase Hughes as a pinnacle of Sullivan&#x27;s achievement. It was the last great Gilbert and Sullivan success.

===1890s===

The relationship between Gilbert and Sullivan suffered its most serious breach in April 1890, during the run of &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;, when Gilbert objected to Carte&#x27;s financial accounts for the production, including a charge to the partnership for the cost of new carpeting for the Savoy Theatre lobby. Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone. Carte was building a new theatre to present Sullivan&#x27;s forthcoming grand opera, and Sullivan sided with Carte, going so far as to sign an affidavit that contained erroneous information about old debts of the partnership. Gilbert took legal action against Carte and Sullivan, vowing to write no more for the Savoy, and so the partnership came to an acrimonious end. Sullivan wrote to Gilbert in September 1890 that he was &quot;physically and mentally ill over this wretched business. I have not yet got over the shock of seeing our names coupled ... in hostile antagonism over a few miserable pounds&quot;.

Sullivan&#x27;s only grand opera, &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, based on Walter Scott&#x27;s novel, opened at Carte&#x27;s new Royal English Opera House on 31 January 1891. Sullivan completed the score too late to meet Carte&#x27;s planned production date, and costs mounted; Sullivan was required to pay Carte a contractual penalty of £3,000 () for his delay. The production lasted for 155 consecutive performances, an unprecedented run for a grand opera, and earned good notices for its music. Afterwards, Carte was unable to fill the new opera house with other opera productions and sold the theatre. Despite the initial success of &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, some writers blamed it for the failure of the opera house, and it soon passed into obscurity. Herman Klein called the episode &quot;the strangest comingling of success and failure ever chronicled in the history of British lyric enterprise!&quot; Later in 1891 Sullivan composed music for Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;The Foresters&quot;, which ran well at Daly&#x27;s Theatre in New York in 1892, but failed in London the following year.
Sullivan returned to comic opera, but because of the fracture with Gilbert, he and Carte sought other collaborators. Sullivan&#x27;s next piece was &quot;Haddon Hall&quot; (1892), with a libretto by Sydney Grundy based loosely on the legend of the elopement of Dorothy Vernon with John Manners. Although still comic, the tone and style of the work was considerably more serious and romantic than most of the operas with Gilbert. It ran for 204 performances, and was praised by critics. In 1895 Sullivan once more provided incidental music for the Lyceum, this time for J. Comyns Carr&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

With the aid of an intermediary, Sullivan&#x27;s music publisher Tom Chappell, the three partners were reunited in 1892. Their next opera, &quot;Utopia, Limited&quot; (1893), ran for 245 performances, barely covering the expenses of the lavish production, although it was the longest run at the Savoy in the 1890s. Sullivan came to disapprove of the leading lady, Nancy McIntosh, and refused to write another piece featuring her; Gilbert insisted that she must appear in his next opera. Instead, Sullivan teamed up again with his old partner, F. C. Burnand. &quot;The Chieftain&quot; (1894), a heavily revised version of their earlier two-act opera, &quot;The Contrabandista&quot;, flopped. Gilbert and Sullivan reunited one more time, after McIntosh announced her retirement from the stage, for &quot;The Grand Duke&quot; (1896). It failed, and Sullivan never worked with Gilbert again, although their operas continued to be revived with success at the Savoy.

In May 1897 Sullivan&#x27;s full-length ballet, &quot;Victoria and Merrie England&quot;, opened at the Alhambra Theatre to celebrate the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee. The work celebrates English history and culture, with the Victorian period as the grand finale. Its six-month run was considered a great achievement. &quot;The Beauty Stone&quot; (1898), with a libretto by Arthur Wing Pinero and J. Comyns Carr, was based on mediaeval morality plays. The collaboration did not go well: Sullivan wrote that Pinero and Comyns Carr were &quot;gifted and brilliant men, with &quot;no&quot; experience in writing for music&quot;, and, when he asked for alterations to improve the structure, they refused. The opera, moreover, was too serious for the Savoy audiences&#x27; tastes. It was a critical failure and ran for only seven weeks.

In 1899, to benefit &quot;the wives and children of soldiers and sailors&quot; on active service in the Boer War, Sullivan composed the music of a song, &quot;The Absent-Minded Beggar&quot;, to a text by Rudyard Kipling, which became an instant sensation and raised an unprecedented £300,000 () for the fund from performances and the sale of sheet music and related merchandise. In &quot;The Rose of Persia&quot; (1899), Sullivan returned to his comic roots, writing to a libretto by Basil Hood that combined an exotic &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; setting with plot elements of &quot;The Mikado&quot;. Sullivan&#x27;s tuneful score was well received, and the opera proved to be his most successful full-length collaboration apart from those with Gilbert. Another opera with Hood, &quot;The Emerald Isle&quot;, quickly went into preparation, but Sullivan died before it was completed. The score was finished by Edward German, and produced in 1901.

===Death, honours and legacy===
Sullivan&#x27;s health was never robust – from his thirties his kidney disease often obliged him to conduct sitting down. He died of heart failure, following an attack of bronchitis, at his flat in Westminster on 22 November 1900. His &quot;Te Deum Laudamus&quot;, written in expectation of victory in the Boer War, was performed posthumously.

A monument in the composer&#x27;s memory featuring a weeping Muse was erected in the Victoria Embankment Gardens in London and is inscribed with Gilbert&#x27;s words from &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot;: &quot;Is life a boon? If so, it must befall that Death, whene&#x27;er he call, must call too soon&quot;. Sullivan wished to be buried in Brompton Cemetery with his parents and brother, but by order of the Queen he was buried in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. In addition to his knighthood, honours awarded to Sullivan in his lifetime included Doctor in Music, &quot;honoris causa&quot;, by the Universities of Cambridge (1876) and Oxford (1879); Chevalier, Légion d&#x27;honneur, France (1878); Order of the Medjidie conferred by the Sultan of Turkey (1888); and appointment as a Member of the Fourth Class of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO) in 1897.

Sullivan&#x27;s operas have often been adapted, first in the 19th century as dance pieces and in foreign adaptations of the operas themselves. Since then, his music has been made into ballets (&quot;Pineapple Poll&quot; (1951) and &quot;Pirates of Penzance – The Ballet!&quot; (1991)) and musicals (&quot;The Swing Mikado&quot; (1938), &quot;The Hot Mikado&quot; (1939) and &quot;Hot Mikado&quot; (1986), &quot;Hollywood Pinafore&quot; and &quot;Memphis Bound&quot; (both 1945), &quot;The Black Mikado&quot; (1975), etc.). His operas are frequently performed, and also parodied, pastiched, quoted and imitated in comedy routines, advertising, law, film, television, and other popular media. He has been portrayed on screen in &quot;The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan&quot; (1953) and &quot;Topsy-Turvy&quot; (2000). He is celebrated not only for writing the Savoy operas and his other works, but also for his influence on the development of modern American and British musical theatre.

==Personal life==

===Romantic life===

Sullivan never married, but he had serious love affairs with several women. The first was with Rachel Scott Russell (1845–1882), the daughter of the engineer John Scott Russell. Sullivan was a frequent visitor at the Scott Russell home in the mid-1860s, and by 1865 the affair was in full bloom. Rachel&#x27;s parents did not approve of a possible union with a young composer of uncertain financial prospects, but the two continued to see each other covertly. At some point in 1868 Sullivan started a simultaneous (and secret) affair with Rachel&#x27;s sister Louise (1841–1878). Both relationships ended by early 1869.

Sullivan&#x27;s longest love affair was with the American socialite Fanny Ronalds, a woman three years his senior, who had two children. He met her in Paris around 1867, and the affair began in earnest soon after she moved to London in 1871. According to a contemporary description of Ronalds, &quot;Her face was perfectly divine in its loveliness, her features small and exquisitely regular. Her hair was a dark shade of brown – &quot;châtain foncé&quot; [deep chestnut] – and very abundant ... a lovely woman, with the most generous smile one could possibly imagine, and the most beautiful teeth.&quot; Sullivan called her &quot;the best amateur singer in London&quot;. She often performed Sullivan&#x27;s songs at her famous Sunday soirées. She became particularly associated with &quot;The Lost Chord&quot;, singing it both in private and in public, often with Sullivan accompanying her. When Sullivan died, he left her the autograph manuscript of that song, along with other bequests.

Ronalds was separated from her American husband, but they never divorced. Social conventions of the time compelled Sullivan and Ronalds to keep their relationship private. She apparently became pregnant at least twice and procured abortions in 1882 and 1884. Sullivan had a roving eye, and his diary records the occasional quarrels when Ronalds discovered his other liaisons, but he always returned to her. Around 1889 or 1890 the sexual relationship evidently ended – he started to refer to her in his diary as &quot;Auntie&quot; – but she remained a constant companion for the rest of his life.

In 1896 the 54-year-old Sullivan proposed marriage to the 22-year-old Violet Beddington (1874–1962), but she refused him.

===Leisure and family life===

Sullivan loved to spend time in France (both in Paris and on the Riviera), where his acquaintances included European royalty and where the casinos enabled him to indulge his passion for gambling. He enjoyed hosting private dinners and entertainments at his home, often featuring famous singers and well-known actors. In 1865 he was initiated into Freemasonry and was Grand Organist of the United Grand Lodge of England in 1887 during Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee. Sullivan&#x27;s talent and native charm gained him the friendship of many, not only in the musical establishment, such as Grove, Chorley and Herman Klein, but also in society circles, such as Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh. Sullivan enjoyed playing tennis; according to George Grossmith, &quot;I have seen some bad lawn-tennis players in my time, but I never saw anyone so bad as Arthur Sullivan&quot;.

Sullivan was devoted to his parents, particularly his mother. He corresponded regularly with her when away from London, until her death in 1882. Henry Lytton wrote, &quot;I believe there was never a more affectionate tie than that which existed between [Sullivan] and his mother, a very witty old lady, and one who took an exceptional pride in her son&#x27;s accomplishments.&quot; Sullivan was also very fond of his brother Fred, whose acting career he assisted whenever possible, and of Fred&#x27;s children. After Fred died at the age of 39, leaving his pregnant wife, Charlotte, with seven children under the age of 14, Sullivan visited the family often and became guardian to the children.

In 1883 Charlotte and six of her children emigrated to Los Angeles, California, leaving the oldest boy, &quot;Bertie&quot;, in Sullivan&#x27;s sole care. Despite his reservations about the move to the United States, Sullivan paid all the costs and gave substantial financial support to the family. A year later, Charlotte died, leaving the children to be raised mostly by her brother. From June to August 1885, after &quot;The Mikado&quot; opened, Sullivan visited the family in Los Angeles and took them on a sightseeing trip of the American west. Throughout the rest of his life, and in his will, he contributed financially to Fred&#x27;s children, continuing to correspond with them and to be concerned with their education, marriages and financial affairs. Bertie remained with his Uncle Arthur for the rest of the composer&#x27;s life.

Three of Sullivan&#x27;s cousins, the daughters of his uncle John Thomas Sullivan, performed with the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company: Rose, Jane (&quot;Jennie&quot;) and Kate Sullivan, the first two of whom used the stage surname Hervey. Kate was a chorister who defected to the Comedy Opera Company&#x27;s rival production of &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, where she had the opportunity to play the leading soprano role, Josephine, in 1879. Jennie was a D&#x27;Oyly Carte chorister for fourteen years. Rose took principal roles in many of the companion pieces that played with the Savoy operas.

==Music==

Sullivan&#x27;s works comprise 24 operas, 11 full orchestral works, ten choral works and oratorios, two ballets, one song cycle, incidental music to several plays, more than 70 hymns and anthems, over 80 songs and parlour ballads, and a body of part songs, carols, and piano and chamber pieces. The operatic output spanned his whole career, as did that of his songs and religious music. The solo piano and chamber pieces are mostly from his early years, and are generally in a Mendelssohnian style. With the exception of his &quot;Imperial March&quot;, composed for a royal occasion in 1893, the large-scale orchestral concert works also date from early in the composer&#x27;s career.

===Influences===
Reviewers and scholars often cite Mendelssohn as the most important influence on Sullivan. The music for &quot;The Tempest&quot; and the &quot;Irish Symphony&quot;, among other works, was seen by contemporary writers as strikingly Mendelssohnian. Percy Young writes that Sullivan&#x27;s early affection for Mendelssohn remained evident throughout his composing career. Hughes remarks that although Sullivan emulated Mendelssohn in certain ways he seldom &quot;lapsed into those harmonic clichés which mar some of Mendelssohn&#x27;s more sentimental effusions&quot;. When &quot;The Tempest&quot; music was first presented the &quot;Neue Zeitschrift für Musik&quot; identified Schumann as a stronger influence, and Benedict Taylor, writing in 2017, concurs. In a 2009 study Taylor adds Schubert as another major influence on Sullivan in his orchestral works, although &quot;from the beginning ... there is the peculiar, intangible stamp of Sullivan emerging confidently&quot;. Meinhard Saremba notes that from Sullivan&#x27;s first meeting with Rossini in Paris, in 1862, Rossini&#x27;s output became a model for Sullivan&#x27;s comic opera music, &quot;as evidenced in several rhythmic patterns and constructions of long finales&quot;.
As a young man, Sullivan&#x27;s conservative musical education led him to follow in the conventions of his predecessors. Later he became more adventurous; Richard Silverman, writing in 2009, points to the influence of Liszt in later works – a harmonic ambiguity and chromaticism – so that by the time of &quot;The Golden Legend&quot; Sullivan had abandoned a home key altogether for the prelude. Sullivan disliked much of Wagner&#x27;s Musikdrama, but he modelled the overture to &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot; on the prelude of &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot;, which he described as &quot;the greatest comic opera ever written&quot;. Saremba writes that in works from his middle and later years, Sullivan was inspired by Verdi&#x27;s example both in details of orchestration, and in &quot;la tinta musical&quot; – the individual musical character of a piece – ranging from the &quot;nautical air of &quot;H.M.S Pinafore&quot;&quot; to &quot;the swift Mediterranean lightness of &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;&quot; and &quot;the bleakness of Torquilstone in &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;&quot;.

===Method of composition and text setting===
Sullivan told an interviewer, Arthur Lawrence, &quot;I don&#x27;t use the piano in composition – that would limit me terribly&quot;. Sullivan explained that his process was not to wait for inspiration, but &quot;to dig for it. ... I decide on [the rhythm] before I come to the question of melody. ... I mark out the metre in dots and dashes, and not until I have quite settled on the rhythm do I proceed to actual notation.&quot; Sullivan&#x27;s text setting, compared with that of his 19th century English predecessors or his European contemporaries, was &quot;vastly more sensitive. ... Sullivan&#x27;s operatic style attempts to create for itself a uniquely English text-music synthesis&quot;, and, in addition, by adopting a conservative musical style, he was able to achieve &quot;the clarity to match Gilbert&#x27;s finely honed wit with musical wit of his own&quot;.

In composing the Savoy operas, Sullivan wrote the vocal lines of the musical numbers first, and these were given to the actors. He, or an assistant, improvised a piano accompaniment at the early rehearsals; he wrote the orchestrations later, after he had seen what Gilbert&#x27;s stage business would be. He left the overtures until last and sometimes delegated their composition, based on his outlines, to his assistants, often adding his suggestions or corrections. Those Sullivan wrote himself include &quot;Thespis&quot;, &quot;Iolanthe&quot;, &quot;Princess Ida&quot;, &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot;, &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;, &quot;The Grand Duke&quot; and probably &quot;Utopia, Limited&quot;. Most of the overtures are structured as a pot-pourri of tunes from the operas in three sections: fast, slow and fast. Those for &quot;Iolanthe&quot; and &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot; are written in a modified sonata form.

===Melody and rhythm===
&quot;The Musical Times&quot; noted that Sullivan&#x27;s tunes, at least in the comic operas, appeal to the professional as much as to the layman: his continental contemporaries such as Saint-Saëns and the Viennese critic Eduard Hanslick held the Savoy operas in high regard. Hughes writes, &quot;When Sullivan wrote what we call &#x27;a good tune&#x27; it was nearly always &#x27;good music&#x27; as well. Outside the ranks of the giants there are few other composers of whom the same could be said.&quot; Although his melodies sprang from rhythm, some of his themes may have been prompted by his chosen instrumentation or his harmonic techniques.
In the comic operas, where many numbers are in verse-plus-refrain form, Sullivan shaped his melodies to provide a climax for the verse, capped by an overall climax in the refrain. Hughes cites &quot;If you go in&quot; (&quot;Iolanthe&quot;) as an example. He adds that Sullivan rarely reached the same class of excellence in instrumental works, where he had no librettist to feed his imagination. Even with Gilbert, on those occasions when the librettist wrote in unvaried metre, Sullivan often followed suit and produced phrases of simple repetition, such as in &quot;Love Is a Plaintive Song&quot; (&quot;Patience&quot;) and &quot;A Man Who Would Woo a Fair Maid&quot; (&quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot;).

Sullivan preferred to write in major keys, overwhelmingly in the Savoy operas, and even in his serious works. Examples of his rare excursions into minor keys include the long E minor melody in the first movement of the &quot;Irish Symphony&quot;, &quot;Go Away, Madam&quot; in the Act I finale of &quot;Iolanthe&quot; (echoing Verdi and Beethoven) and the execution march in the Act I finale of &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot;.

===Harmony and counterpoint===
Sullivan was trained in the classical style, and contemporary music did not greatly attract him. Harmonically his early works used the conventional formulae of early-nineteenth-century composers including Mendelssohn, Auber, Donizetti, Balfe and Schubert. Hughes comments that harmonic contrast in the Savoy works is enhanced by Sullivan&#x27;s characteristic modulation between keys, as in &quot;Expressive Glances&quot; (&quot;Princess Ida&quot;), where he negotiates smoothly E major, C sharp minor and C major, or &quot;Then One of Us will Be a Queen&quot; (&quot;The Gondoliers&quot;), where he writes in F major, D flat major and D minor.

When reproached for using consecutive fifths in &quot;Cox and Box&quot;, Sullivan replied &quot;if 5ths turn up it doesn&#x27;t matter, so long as there is no offence to the ear.&quot; Both Hughes and Jacobs in &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; comment adversely on Sullivan&#x27;s overuse of tonic pedals, usually in the bass, which Hughes attributes to &quot;lack of enterprise or even downright laziness&quot;. Another Sullivan trademark criticised by Hughes is the repeated use of the chord of the augmented fourth at moments of pathos. In his serious works, Sullivan attempted to avoid harmonic devices associated with the Savoy operas, with the result, according to Hughes, that &quot;The Golden Legend&quot; is a &quot;hotch-potch of harmonic styles&quot;.
One of Sullivan&#x27;s best-known devices is what Jacobs terms his &quot;&#x27;counterpoint of characters&#x27;: the presentation by different personages of two seemingly independent tunes which later come together&quot; simultaneously. He was not the first composer to combine themes in this way, but in Jacobs&#x27;s phrase it became almost &quot;the trademark of Sullivan&#x27;s operetta style&quot;. Sometimes the melodies were for solo voices, as in &quot;I Am So Proud&quot; (&quot;The Mikado&quot;), which combines three melodic lines. Other examples are in choruses, where typically a graceful tune for the women is combined with a robust one for the men. Examples include &quot;When the Foeman Bares his Steel&quot; (&quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;), &quot;In a Doleful Train&quot; (&quot;Patience&quot;) and &quot;Welcome, Gentry&quot; (&quot;Ruddigore&quot;). In &quot;How Beautifully Blue the Sky&quot; (&quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;), one theme is given to the chorus (in 2/4 time) and the other to solo voices (in 3/4).

Sullivan rarely composed fugues. Examples are from the &quot;Epilogue&quot; to &quot;The Golden Legend&quot; and &quot;Victoria and Merrie England&quot;. In the Savoy operas, fugal style is reserved for making fun of legal solemnity in &quot;Trial by Jury&quot; and &quot;Iolanthe&quot; (e.g., the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s leitmotif in the latter). Less formal counterpoint is employed in numbers such as &quot;Brightly Dawns Our Wedding Day&quot; (&quot;The Mikado&quot;) and &quot;When the Buds Are Blossoming&quot; (&quot;Ruddigore&quot;).

===Orchestration===
Hughes concludes his chapter on Sullivan&#x27;s orchestration: &quot;[I]n this vitally important sector of the composer&#x27;s art he deserves to rank as a master.&quot; Sullivan was a competent player of at least four orchestral instruments (flute, clarinet, trumpet and trombone) and technically a most skilful orchestrator. Though sometimes inclined to indulge in grandiosity when writing for a full symphony orchestra, he was adept in using smaller forces to the maximum effect. Young writes that orchestral players generally like playing Sullivan&#x27;s music: &quot;Sullivan never asked his players to do what was either uncongenial or impracticable.&quot;
Sullivan&#x27;s orchestra for the Savoy operas was typical of the theatre orchestra of his era: 2 flutes (+ piccolo), oboe, 2 clarinets, bassoon, 2 horns, 2 cornets, 2 trombones, timpani, percussion and strings. According to Geoffrey Toye, the number of players in Sullivan&#x27;s Savoy Theatre orchestras was a &quot;minimum&quot; of 31. Sullivan argued hard for an increase in the pit orchestra&#x27;s size, and, starting with &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot;, the orchestra was augmented with a second bassoon and a second tenor trombone. He generally orchestrated each score at almost the last moment, noting that the accompaniment for an opera had to wait until he saw the staging, so that he could judge how heavily or lightly to orchestrate each part of the music. For his large-scale orchestral pieces, which often employed very large forces, Sullivan added a second oboe part, sometimes double bassoon and bass clarinet, more horns, trumpets, tuba, and occasionally an organ and/or a harp.

One of the most recognisable features in Sullivan&#x27;s orchestration is his woodwind scoring. Hughes especially notes Sullivan&#x27;s clarinet writing, exploiting all registers and colours of the instrument, and his particular fondness for oboe solos. For instance, the &quot;Irish Symphony&quot; contains two long solo oboe passages in succession, and in the Savoy operas there are many shorter examples. In the operas, and also in concert works, another characteristic Sullivan touch is his fondness for pizzicato passages for the string sections. Hughes instances &quot;Kind Sir, You Cannot Have the Heart&quot; (&quot;The Gondoliers&quot;), &quot;Free From his Fetters Grim&quot; (&quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot;) and &quot;In Vain to Us You Plead&quot; (&quot;Iolanthe&quot;).

===Musical quotations and parodies===

Throughout the Savoy operas, and occasionally in other works, Sullivan quotes or imitates well-known themes or parodies the styles of famous composers. On occasion he may have echoed his predecessors unconsciously: Hughes cites a Handelian influence in &quot;Hereupon We&#x27;re Both Agreed&quot; (&quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot;), and Rodney Milnes called &quot;Sighing Softly&quot; in &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; &quot;a song plainly inspired by – and indeed worthy of – Sullivan&#x27;s hero, Schubert&quot;. Edward Greenfield found a theme in the slow movement of the &quot;Irish Symphony&quot; &quot;an outrageous crib&quot; from Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Unfinished&quot; Symphony. In early pieces, Sullivan drew on Mendelssohn&#x27;s style in his music for &quot;The Tempest&quot;, Auber&#x27;s in his &quot;Henry VIII&quot; music and Gounod&#x27;s in &quot;The Light of the World&quot;. The influence of Mendelssohn pervades the fairy music in &quot;Iolanthe&quot;. &quot;The Golden Legend&quot; shows the influence of Liszt and Wagner.

Sullivan adopted traditional musical forms, such as madrigals in &quot;The Mikado&quot;, &quot;Ruddigore&quot; and &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot; and glees in &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; and &quot;The Mikado&quot;, and the Venetian barcarolle in &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;. He made use of dance styles to enhance the sense of time or place in various scenes: gavottes in &quot;Ruddigore&quot; and &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;; a country dance in &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;; a nautical hornpipe in &quot;Ruddigore&quot;; and the Spanish cachucha and Italian saltarello and tarantella in &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;. Occasionally he drew on influences from further afield. In &quot;The Mikado&quot;, he used an old Japanese war song, and his 1882 trip to Egypt inspired musical styles in his later opera &quot;The Rose of Persia&quot;.

Elsewhere, Sullivan wrote undisguised parody. Of the sextet &quot;I Hear the Soft Note&quot; in &quot;Patience&quot;, he said to the singers, &quot;I think you will like this. It is Dr Arne and Purcell at their best.&quot; In his comic operas, he followed Offenbach&#x27;s lead in lampooning the idioms of French and Italian opera, such as those of Donizetti, Bellini and Verdi. Examples of his operatic parody include Mabel&#x27;s aria &quot;Poor Wand&#x27;ring One&quot; in &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, the duet &quot;Who Are You, Sir?&quot; from &quot;Cox and Box&quot;, and the whispered plans for elopement in &quot;This Very Night&quot; in &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, parodying the conspirators&#x27; choruses in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Il trovatore&quot; and &quot;Rigoletto&quot;. The mock-jingoistic &quot;He Is an Englishman&quot; in &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; and choral passages in &quot;The Zoo&quot; satirise patriotic British tunes such as Arne&#x27;s &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot;. The chorus &quot;With Catlike Tread&quot; from &quot;The Pirates&quot; parodies Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Anvil Chorus&quot; from &quot;Il trovatore&quot;.

Hughes calls Bouncer&#x27;s song in &quot;Cox and Box&quot; &quot;a jolly Handelian parody&quot; and notes a strong Handelian flavour to Arac&#x27;s song in Act III of &quot;Princess Ida&quot;. In &quot;A More Humane Mikado&quot;, at the words &quot;Bach interwoven with Spohr and Beethoven&quot;, the clarinet and bassoon quote the fugue subject of Bach&#x27;s Fantasia and Fugue in G minor. Sullivan sometimes used Wagnerian leitmotifs for both comic and dramatic effect. In &quot;Iolanthe&quot;, a distinctive four-note theme is associated with the title character, the Lord Chancellor has a fugal motif, and the Fairy Queen&#x27;s music parodies that of Wagner heroines such as Brünnhilde. In &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot; the Tower of London is evoked by its own motif. This use of the leitmotif technique is repeated and developed further in &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;.

==Reputation and criticism==
===Early reception===
Sullivan&#x27;s critical reputation has undergone extreme changes since the 1860s when critics, struck by his potential, hailed him as the long-awaited great English composer. His incidental music to &quot;The Tempest&quot; was received with acclaim at the Crystal Palace, just before his 20th birthday, in April 1862. &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; commented:

His &quot;Irish Symphony&quot; of 1866 won similarly enthusiastic praise, but as Arthur Jacobs notes, &quot;The first rapturous outburst of enthusiasm for Sullivan as an orchestral composer did not last.&quot; A comment typical of those that followed him throughout his career was that &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s unquestionable talent should make him doubly careful not to mistake popular applause for artistic appreciation.&quot;

When Sullivan turned to comic opera with Gilbert, the serious critics began to express disapproval. The music critic Peter Gammond writes of &quot;misapprehensions and prejudices, delivered to our door by the Victorian firm Musical Snobs Ltd. ... frivolity and high spirits were sincerely seen as elements that could not be exhibited by anyone who was to be admitted to the sanctified society of Art.&quot; As early as 1877 &quot;The London Figaro&quot; commented that Sullivan &quot;wilfully throws his opportunity away. ... He possesses all the natural ability to have given us an English opera, and, instead, he affords us a little more-or-less excellent fooling.&quot; Few critics denied the excellence of Sullivan&#x27;s theatre scores. &quot;The Theatre&quot; commented, &quot;&quot;Iolanthe&quot; sustains Dr. Sullivan&#x27;s reputation as the most spontaneous, fertile, and scholarly composer of comic opera this country has ever produced.&quot; Comic opera, no matter how skilfully crafted, was viewed as an intrinsically lower form of art than oratorio. &quot;The Athenaeum&#x27;s&quot; review of &quot;The Martyr of Antioch&quot; declared: &quot;[I]t is an advantage to have the composer of &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; occupying himself with a worthier form of art.&quot;

===Knighthood and later years===
Sullivan&#x27;s knighthood in 1883 gave the serious music critics further ammunition. &quot;The Musical Review&quot; of that year observed:
Even Sullivan&#x27;s friend George Grove wrote: &quot;Surely the time has come when so able and experienced a master of voice, orchestra, and stage effect – master, too, of so much genuine sentiment – may apply his gifts to a serious opera on some subject of abiding human or natural interest.&quot; Sullivan finally redeemed himself in critical eyes with &quot;The Golden Legend&quot; in 1886. &quot;The Observer&quot; hailed it as a &quot;triumph of English art&quot;. &quot;The World&quot; called it &quot;one of the greatest creations we have had for many years. Original, bold, inspired, grand in conception, in execution, in treatment, it is a composition which will make an &#x27;epoch&#x27; and which will carry the name of its composer higher on the wings of fame and glory. ... The effect of the public performance was unprecedented.&quot;

Hopes for a new departure were expressed in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&#x27;s&quot; review of &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot; (1888), Sullivan&#x27;s most serious opera to that point: &quot;[T]he music follows the book to a higher plane, and we have a genuine English opera, forerunner of many others, let us hope, and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage.&quot; Sullivan&#x27;s only grand opera, &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1891), received generally favourable reviews, although J. A. Fuller Maitland, in &quot;The Times&quot;, expressed reservations, writing that the opera&#x27;s &quot;best portions rise so far above anything else that Sir Arthur Sullivan has given to the world, and have such force and dignity, that it is not difficult to forget the drawbacks which may be found in the want of interest in much of the choral writing, and the brevity of the concerted solo parts.&quot; Sullivan&#x27;s 1897 ballet &quot;Victoria and Merrie England&quot; was one of several late pieces that won praise from most critics: 
Although the more solemn members of the musical establishment could not forgive Sullivan for writing music that was both comic and accessible, he was, nevertheless, &quot;the nation&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; composer laureate&quot;. His obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; called him England&#x27;s &quot;most conspicuous composer ... the musician who had such power to charm all classes. ... The critic and the student found new beauties at every fresh hearing. What ... set Sullivan in popular esteem far above all the other English composers of his day was the tunefulness of his music, that quality in it by which ... [it] was immediately recognized as a joyous contribution to the gaiety of life. ... Sullivan&#x27;s name stood as a synonym for music in England.

===Posthumous reputation===

In the decade after his death, Sullivan&#x27;s reputation sank considerably among music critics. In 1901 Fuller Maitland took issue with the generally laudatory tone of the obituaries: &quot;Is there anywhere a case quite parallel to that of Sir Arthur Sullivan, who began his career with a work which at once stamped him as a genius, and to the height of which he only rarely attained throughout life? ... It is because such great natural gifts – gifts greater, perhaps, than fell to any English musician since ... Purcell – were so very seldom employed in work worthy of them.&quot; Edward Elgar, to whom Sullivan had been particularly kind, rose to Sullivan&#x27;s defence, branding Fuller Maitland&#x27;s obituary &quot;the shady side of musical criticism ... that foul unforgettable episode&quot;.
Fuller Maitland&#x27;s followers, including Ernest Walker, also dismissed Sullivan as &quot;merely the idle singer of an empty evening&quot;. As late as 1966 Frank Howes, a music critic for &quot;The Times&quot;, condemned Sullivan for a &quot;lack of sustained effort ... a fundamental lack of seriousness towards his art [and] inability to perceive the smugness, the sentimentality and banality of the Mendelssohnian detritus ... to remain content with the flattest and most obvious rhythms, this yielding to a fatal facility, that excludes Sullivan from the ranks of the good composers.&quot; Thomas Dunhill wrote in 1928 that Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;music has suffered in an extraordinary degree from the vigorous attacks which have been made upon it in professional circles. These attacks have succeeded in surrounding the composer with a kind of barricade of prejudice which must be swept away before justice can be done to his genius.&quot;

Sir Henry Wood continued to perform Sullivan&#x27;s serious music. In 1942 Wood presented a Sullivan centenary concert at the Royal Albert Hall, but it was not until the 1960s that Sullivan&#x27;s music other than the Savoy operas began to be widely revived. In 1960 Hughes published the first full-length book about Sullivan&#x27;s music &quot;which, while taking note of his weaknesses (which are many) and not hesitating to castigate his lapses from good taste (which were comparatively rare) [attempted] to view them in perspective against the wider background of his sound musicianship.&quot; The work of the Sir Arthur Sullivan Society, founded in 1977, and books about Sullivan by musicians such as Young (1971) and Jacobs (1986) contributed to the re-evaluation of Sullivan&#x27;s serious music. The &quot;Irish Symphony&quot; had its first professional recording in 1968, and many of Sullivan&#x27;s non-Gilbert works have since been recorded. Scholarly critical editions of an increasing number of Sullivan&#x27;s works have been published.

In 1957 a review in &quot;The Times&quot; explained Sullivan&#x27;s contributions to &quot;the continued vitality of the Savoy operas&quot;: &quot;Gilbert&#x27;s lyrics ... take on extra point and sparkle when set to Sullivan&#x27;s music. ... [Sullivan, too, is] a delicate wit, whose airs have a precision, a neatness, a grace, and a flowing melody&quot;. A 2000 article in &quot;The Musical Times&quot; by Nigel Burton noted the resurgence of Sullivan&#x27;s reputation beyond the comic operas:

==Recordings==

On 14 August 1888 George Gouraud introduced Thomas Edison&#x27;s phonograph to London in a press conference, including the playing of a piano and cornet recording of Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Lost Chord&quot;, one of the first recordings of music ever made. At a party on 5 October 1888 given to demonstrate the technology, Sullivan recorded a speech to be sent to Edison, saying, in part: &quot;I am astonished and somewhat terrified at the result of this evening&#x27;s experiments: astonished at the wonderful power you have developed, and terrified at the thought that so much hideous and bad music may be put on record forever. But all the same I think it is the most wonderful thing that I have ever experienced, and I congratulate you with all my heart on this wonderful discovery.&quot; These recordings were found in the Edison Library in New Jersey in the 1950s:
The first commercial recordings of Sullivan&#x27;s music, beginning in 1898, were of individual numbers from the Savoy operas. In 1917 the Gramophone Company (HMV) produced the first album of a complete Gilbert and Sullivan opera, &quot;The Mikado&quot;, followed by eight more. Electrical recordings of most of the operas issued by HMV and Victor followed from the 1920s, supervised by Rupert D&#x27;Oyly Carte. The D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company continued to produce recordings until 1979. After the copyrights expired, recordings were made by opera companies such as Gilbert and Sullivan for All and Australian Opera, and Sir Malcolm Sargent and Sir Charles Mackerras each conducted audio sets of several Savoy operas. Since 1994, the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival has released professional and amateur CDs and videos of its productions and other Sullivan recordings, and Ohio Light Opera has recorded several of the operas in the 21st century.

Sullivan&#x27;s non-Savoy works were infrequently recorded until the 1960s. A few of his songs were put on disc in the early years of the 20th century, including versions of &quot;The Lost Chord&quot; by Enrico Caruso and Clara Butt. The first of many recordings of the &quot;Overture di Ballo&quot; was made in 1932, conducted by Sargent. The &quot;Irish Symphony&quot; was first recorded in 1968 under Sir Charles Groves. Since then, much of Sullivan&#x27;s serious music and his operas without Gilbert have been recorded, including the &quot;Cello Concerto&quot; by Julian Lloyd Webber (1986); and &quot;The Rose of Persia&quot; (1999); &quot;The Golden Legend&quot; (2001); &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (2009); and &quot;The Masque at Kenilworth&quot; and &quot;On Shore and Sea&quot; (2014), conducted by, respectively, Tom Higgins, Ronald Corp, David Lloyd-Jones and Richard Bonynge. In 2017 Chandos Records released an album, &quot;Songs&quot;, which includes &quot;The Window&quot; and 35 individual Sullivan songs. Mackerras&#x27;s Sullivan ballet, &quot;Pineapple Poll&quot;, has received many recordings since its first performance in 1951.

<text>There is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples, although in the 21st century the focus has been on self-identification, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.

Estimates of the population of Indigenous peoples range from 250 million to 600 million. There are some 5,000 distinct Indigenous peoples spread across every inhabited climate zone and inhabited continent of the world. Most Indigenous peoples are in a minority in the state or traditional territory they inhabit and have experienced domination by other groups, especially non-Indigenous peoples. Although many Indigenous peoples have experienced colonization by settlers from European nations, Indigenous identity is not determined by Western colonization.

The rights of Indigenous peoples are outlined in national legislation, treaties and international law. The 1989 International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples protects Indigenous peoples from discrimination and specifies their rights to development, customary laws, lands, territories and resources, employment, education and health. In 2007, the United Nations (UN) adopted a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples including their rights to self-determination and to protect their cultures, identities, languages, ceremonies, and access to employment, health, education and natural resources.

Indigenous peoples continue to face threats to their sovereignty, economic well-being, languages, cultural heritage, and access to the resources on which their cultures depend. In the 21st century, Indigenous groups and advocates for Indigenous peoples have highlighted numerous apparent violations of the rights of Indigenous peoples.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Indigenous&quot; is derived from the Latin word , meaning &quot;sprung from the land, native&quot;. The Latin &quot;&quot; is based on the Old Latin &quot;in, within&quot; + &quot;gignere&quot; &quot;to beget, produce&quot;. &quot;Indu&quot; is an extended form of the Proto-Indo-European &quot;en&quot; or &quot;in&quot;.

== Definitions ==
There is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples in the United Nations or international law. Various national and international organizations, non-government organizations, governments, Indigenous groups and scholars have developed definitions or have declined to provide a definition.

=== Historical ===
As a reference to a group of people, the term &quot;indigenous&quot; was first used by Europeans to differentiate the Indigenous peoples of the Americas from enslaved Africans. The first known use was by Sir Thomas Browne in 1646, who wrote &quot;and although in many parts thereof there be at present swarms of &quot;Negroes&quot; serving under the &quot;Spaniard&quot;, yet were they all transported from &quot;Africa&quot;, since the discovery of &quot;Columbus&quot;; and are not indigenous or proper natives of &quot;America&quot;.&quot;

In the 1970s, the term was used as a way of linking the experiences, issues, and struggles of groups of colonized people across international borders. At this time &#x27;indigenous people(s)&#x27; also began to be used to describe a legal category in Indigenous law created in international and national legislation. The use of the plural &#x27;peoples&#x27; recognizes the cultural differences between various Indigenous peoples.

The first meeting of the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations (WGIP) was on 9 August 1982 and this date is now celebrated as the International Day of the World&#x27;s Indigenous Peoples.

=== Recent ===
In the 21st century, the concept of Indigenous peoples is understood in a wider context than only the colonial experience. The focus has been on self-identification as indigenous peoples, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.

====United Nations====
No definition of Indigenous peoples has been adopted by a United Nations agency. The Secretariat of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues states, &quot;in the case of the concept of &#x27;indigenous peoples&#x27;, the prevailing view today is that no formal universal definition of the term is necessary, given that a single definition will inevitably be either over- or under-inclusive, making sense in some societies but not in others.&quot;

However, a number of UN agencies have provided statements of coverage for particular international agreements concerning Indigenous peoples or &quot;working definitions&quot; for particular reports.

The International Labour Organization&#x27;s (ILO) Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (ILO Convention No. 169), states that the convention covers:peoples in independent countries who are regarded as indigenous on account of their descent from the populations which inhabited the country, or a geographical region to which the country belongs, at the time of conquest or colonisation or the establishment of present state boundaries and who, irrespective of their legal status, retain some or all of their own social, economic, cultural and political institutions.The convention also covers &quot;tribal peoples&quot; who are distinguished from Indigenous peoples and described as &quot;tribal peoples in independent countries whose social, cultural and economic conditions distinguish them from other sections of the national community and whose status is regulated wholly or partially by their own customs or traditions or by special laws or regulations.&quot;

The convention states that self-identification as indigenous or tribal is a fundamental criterion for determining the groups to which the convention applies. The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples does not define Indigenous peoples but affirms their right to self-determination including determining their own identity.

==== Inter-American Commission on Human Rights ====
The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights does not provide a definition of Indigenous peoples stating that, &quot;such a definition is not necessary for purposes of protecting their human rights.&quot; In determining coverage of Indigenous peoples, the commission uses the criteria developed in documents such as ILO Convention No. 169 and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The commission states that self-identification as indigenous is a fundamental criterion.

==== World Bank ====
The World Bank states, &quot;Indigenous Peoples are distinct social and cultural groups that share collective ancestral ties to the lands and natural resources where they live, occupy or from which they have been displaced.&quot;

==== Amnesty International ====
Amnesty International does not provide a definition of Indigenous peoples but states that they can be identified according to certain characteristics:
* Self identification as Indigenous peoples
* A historical link with those who inhabited a country or region at the time when people of different cultures or ethnic origins arrived
* A strong link to territories and surrounding natural resources
* Distinct social, economic or political systems
* A distinct language, culture and beliefs
* Marginalized and discriminated against by the state
* They maintain and develop their ancestral environments and systems as distinct peoples

==== Scholars ====
Academics and other scholars have developed various definitions of Indigenous peoples. In 1986–87, José Martínez Cobo, developed the following &quot;working definition&quot; :Indigenous communities, peoples, and nations are those that, having a historical continuity with pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies that developed on their territories, consider themselves distinct from other sectors of the societies now prevailing in those territories, or parts of them. They form at present non-dominant sectors of society and are determined to preserve, develop, and transmit to future generations their ancestral territories, and their ethnic identity, as the basis of their continued existence as peoples, in accordance with their own cultural patterns, social institutions and legal systems.Martínez Cobo states that the following factors are relevant to historical continuity: occupation of ancestral lands, or at least of part of them; common ancestry with the original occupants of these lands; cultural factors such as religion, tribalism, dress, etc.; language; residence in certain parts of the country, or in certain regions of the world; and other relevant factors.In 2004, James Anaya, defined Indigenous peoples as &quot;living descendants of pre-invasion inhabitants of lands now dominated by others. They are culturally distinct groups that find themselves engulfed by other settler societies born of forces of empire and conquest&quot;.

In 2012, Tuck and Yang propose a criterion based on accounts of origin: &quot;Indigenous peoples are those who have creation stories, not colonization stories, about how we/they came to be in a particular place – indeed how we/they came to be a place. Our/their relationships to land comprise our/their epistemologies, ontologies, and cosmologies&quot;. Indigenous peoples such as the Maasai and the Māori have oral traditional histories involving migration to their current location from somewhere else.

Anthropologist Manvir Singh states that the term may lack coherence, pointing to inconsistencies in which ethnic groups are called Indigenous or not, and notes several scholars who suggest that it instead acts as a relabeling of discredited and colonial ideas about &quot;primitive&quot; people. Singh states that some Indigenous people argue that the term and identity has resulted in pressure to appear &quot;primordial&quot; and &quot;unchanging&quot;, and erases complex and modern identities.

Other views

It is sometimes argued that all Africans are Indigenous to Africa, all Asians are Indigenous to parts of Asia, or that there can be no Indigenous peoples in countries which did not experience large-scale Western settler colonialism. Many countries have avoided the term Indigenous peoples or have denied that Indigenous peoples exist in their territory, and have classified minorities who identify as Indigenous in other ways, such as &#x27;hill tribes&#x27; in Thailand, &#x27;scheduled tribes&#x27; in India, &#x27;national minorities&#x27; in China, &#x27;cultural minorities&#x27; in the Philippines, &#x27;isolated and alien peoples&#x27; in Indonesia, and various other terms.

==History==

===Classical antiquity===
Greek sources of the Classical period acknowledge Indigenous people whom they referred to as &quot;Pelasgians&quot;. Ancient writers saw these people either as the ancestors of the Greeks, or as an earlier group of people who inhabited Greece before the Greeks. The disposition and precise identity of this former group is elusive, and sources such as Homer, Hesiod and Herodotus give varying, partially mythological accounts. Dionysius of Halicarnassus in his book, &quot;Roman Antiquities&quot;, gives a synoptic interpretation of the Pelasgians based on the sources available to him then, concluding that Pelasgians were Greek.

===Africa===
In European late antiquity, many Berbers, Copts and Nubians of north Africa converted to various forms of Christianity under Roman rule, although elements of traditional religious beliefs were retained. Following the Arab invasions of North Africa in the 7th century, many Berbers were enslaved or recruited into the army. The majority of Berbers, however, remained nomadic pastoralists who also engaged in trade as far as sub-Saharan Africa. Coptic Egyptians remained in possession of their lands and many preserved their language and Christian religion. By the 10th century, however, the majority of the population of north Africa spoke Arabic and practiced Islam.From 1402, the Guanche of the Canary Islands resisted Spanish attempts at colonization. The islands finally came under Spanish control in 1496. Mohamed Adhikari has called the conquest of the islands a genocide.

Early 15th-century Portuguese exploration of the west coast of Africa was motivated by a quest for gold and crusading against Islam. Portugal&#x27;s first attempt at colonization in what is now Senegal ended in failure. In the 1470s, the Portuguese established a fortified trading post on the West coast of Africa, south of the Akan goldfields. The Portuguese engaged in extensive trade of goods for gold and, in later years, slaves for their sugar plantations in the islands off West Africa and in the New World. In 1488, Portuguese ships rounded the Cape of Good Hope and by the 17th century, Portugal had established seaborn trading routes and fortified coastal trading posts from West Africa to India and Southern China, and a settler colony in Brazil.

In 1532, the first African slaves were transported directly to the Americas. The trade in slaves expanded sharply in the 17th century, with the involvement of the French, Dutch and English, before declining in the 19th century. At least 12 million slaves were transported from Africa. The slave trade increased inter-tribal warfare and stunted population growth and economic development in the west African interior.

===Americas===

Indigenous encounters with Europeans increased during the age of discovery. The Europeans were motivated by a range of factors including trade, the exploitation of natural resources, spreading Christianity, and establishing strategic military bases, colonies and settlements.

From 1492, the Arawak peoples of the Caribbean islands encountered Spanish colonizers initially led by Christopher Columbus. The Spanish enslaved some of the native population and forced others to work on farms and gold mines in a system of labor called &quot;encomienda&quot;. Spanish settlements spread from Hispaniola to Puerto Rico, the Bahamas and Cuba, leading to a severe decline in the Indigenous populations from disease, malnutrition, settler violence and cultural disruption.

In the 1520s, the peoples of Mesoamerica encountered the Spanish who entered their lands in search of gold and other resources. Some indigenous peoples chose to ally with the Spanish to end Aztec rule. The Spanish incursions led to the conquest of the Aztec Empire and its fall. The Cempoalans, Tlaxcalans and other allies of the Spanish were given some autonomy, but the Spanish were de facto rulers of Mexico. Smallpox devastated the indigenous population and aided the Spanish conquest.

In 1530, the Spanish sailed south from Panama to the lands of the Inca Empire in the west of South America. The Inca, weakened by a smallpox epidemic and civil war, were defeated by the Spanish at Cajamarca in 1532, and the emperor Atahualpa was captured and executed. The Spanish appointed a puppet emperor and captured the Inca capital of Cuzco with the support of a number of native peoples. The Spanish established a new capital in 1535 and defeated an Inca rebellion in 1537, thus consolidating the conquest of Peru.

In the 1560s, the Spanish established colonies in Florida and in 1598 founded a colony in New Mexico. However, the heartland of the Spanish colonies remained New Spain (including Mexico and most of Central America) and Peru (including most of South America).

In the 17th century, French, English and Dutch trading posts multiplied in northern America to exploit whaling, fishing and fur trading. French settlements progressed up the St Lawrence river to the Great Lakes and down the Mississippi to Louisiana. English and Dutch settlements multiplied down the Atlantic coast from modern Massachusetts to Georgia. Native peoples formed alliances with the Europeans in order to promote trade, preserve their autonomy, and gain allies in conflicts with other native peoples. However, horses and new weapons made inter-tribal conflicts more deadly and the native population was devastated by introduced diseases. Native peoples also experienced losses from violent conflict with the colonists and the progressive dispossession of their traditional lands.In 1492, the population of the Americas as a whole was about 50 to 100 million. By 1700, introduced diseases had reduced the native population by 90%. European migration and transfer of slaves from Africa reduced the native population to a minority. By 1800 the population of North America comprised about 5 million Europeans and their descendants, one million Africans and 600,000 indigenous Americans.

Native populations also encountered new animals and plants introduced by Europeans. These included pigs, horses, mules, sheep and cattle; wheat, barley, rye, oats, grasses and grapevines. These exotic animals and plants radically transformed the local environment and disrupted traditional agriculture and hunting practices.

=== Oceania ===
The indigenous populations of the Pacific had increasing contact with Europeans in the 18th century as British, French and Spanish expeditions explored the region. The natives of Tahiti had encounters with the expeditions of Wallis (1766), Bougainville (1768), Cook (1769) and many others before being colonized by the French. The indigenous inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands first encountered Europeans in 1778 when Cook explored the region. Following increasing contact with European missionaries, traders and scientific expeditions, the indigenous population fell before their lands were annexed by the United States in 1893.

The Māori of New Zealand also had sporadic encounters with Europeans in the 17th and 18th centuries. Following encounters with Cook&#x27;s exploration parties in 1769–70, New Zealand was visited by numerous European and North American whaling, sealing, and trading ships. From the early 19th century, Christian missionaries began to settle New Zealand, eventually converting most of the Māori population. The Māori population declined to around 40% of its pre-contact level during the 19th century; introduced diseases were the major factor. New Zealand became a British Crown colony in 1841.

The Aboriginal inhabitants of Australia, after brief encounters with European explorers in the 17th and 18th centuries, had extensive contact with Europeans when the continent was progressively colonized by the British from 1788. During colonization, the Aboriginal people experienced depopulation from disease and settler violence, dispossession of their land, and severe disruption of their traditional cultures. By 1850, indigenous peoples were a minority in Australia.

=== European justifications for colonization ===

From the 15th to the 19th centuries, European powers used a number of rationales for the colonization of newly encountered lands populated by indigenous peoples. These included a duty to spread the Gospel to non-Christians, to bring civilization to barbarian peoples, a natural law right to explore and trade freely with other peoples, and a right to settle and cultivate uninhabited or uncultivated land which they considered &quot;terra nullius&quot; (&quot;no one&#x27;s land&quot;).

Robert J. Miller, Jacinta Ruru, Larissa Behrendt and Tracey Lindberg argue that European powers rationalized their colonization of the New World by the discovery doctrine, which they trace back to papal decrees authorizing Spain and Portugal to conquer newly discovered non-Christian lands and convert their populations to Christianity. Kent McNeil, however, states, &quot;While Spain and Portugal favoured discovery and papal grants because it was generally in their interests to do so, France and Britain relied more on symbolic acts, colonial charters, and occupation.&quot; Benton and Strauman argue that European powers often adopted multiple, sometimes contradictory, legal rationales for their acquisition of territory as a deliberate strategy in defending their claims against European rivals.

=== Settler independence and continuing colonialism ===

Although the establishment of colonies throughout the world by various European powers aimed to expand those powers&#x27; wealth and influence, settler populations in some localities became anxious to assert their own autonomy. For example, settler independence movements in thirteen of the British American colonies were successful by 1783, following the American Revolutionary War. This resulted in the establishment of the United States of America as an entity separate from the British Empire. The United States continued and expanded European colonial doctrine through adopting a version of the discovery doctrine as law in 1823 with the US Supreme Court case &quot;Johnson v. McIntosh&quot;. Statements at the &quot;Johnson&quot; court case illuminated the United States&#x27; support for the principles of the discovery doctrine:The United States ... [and] its civilized inhabitants now hold this country. They hold, and assert in themselves, the title by which it was acquired. They maintain, as all others have maintained, that discovery gave an exclusive right to extinguish the Indian title of occupancy, either by purchase or by conquest; and gave also a right to such a degree of sovereignty, as the circumstances of the people would allow them to exercise. ... [This loss of native property and sovereignty rights was justified, the Court said, by] the character and religion of its inhabitants ... the superior genius of Europe ... [and] ample compensation to the [Indians] by bestowing on them civilization and Christianity, in exchange for unlimited independence.

==Population and distribution==

21st-century estimates of the population of Indigenous peoples range from 250 million to 750 million. In 2007, Mirjan Hirch, a researcher with the Center for World Indigenous Studies, estimated the population at 750 million to a billion, comprising six to seven thousand distinct peoples. The United Nations estimated in 2009 that there were over 370 million Indigenous people living in over 90 countries worldwide, belonging to at least 5,000 distinct peoples. In 2011, the World Bank estimated 300 million indigenous peoples, including 23 million in Latin America, 106 million in China, 95 million in South Asia, 30 million in Southeast Asia, 22 million in Africa, 15 million in the Arab States and 9 million in the rest of the world. The International Labor Organization in 2019 estimated, based on census data, that there were 476 million Indigenous people in 58 countries. Both the UN and the ILO described their estimates as minimums with the latter calculated using &quot;the most reliable lower bound estimates available.&quot; 

As there is no universally accepted definition of Indigenous Peoples, their classification as such varies between countries and organizations. In the Americas, Australia and New Zealand, Indigenous status is often applied unproblematically to groups descended from the peoples who lived there prior to European settlement. However, In Asia and Africa, Indigenous status has sometimes been rejected by certain peoples, denied by governments or applied to peoples who may not be considered &quot;Indigenous&quot; in other contexts. The concept of indigenous peoples is rarely used in Europe, where very few indigenous groups are recognized, with the exception of groups such as the Sámi.

===Environmental and economic benefits of the Indigenous stewardship of land===
A WRI report mentions that &quot;tenure-secure&quot; Indigenous lands generates billions and sometimes trillions of dollars&#x27; worth of benefits in the form of carbon sequestration, reduced pollution, clean water and more. It says that tenure-secure Indigenous lands have low deforestation rates, they help to reduce GHG emissions, control erosion and flooding by anchoring soil, and provide a suite of other local, regional and global ecosystem services.
However, many of these communities find themselves on the front lines of the deforestation crisis, and their lives and livelihoods threatened.

== Indigenous peoples and the environment ==
Misconceptions about the historical relationship between Indigenous populations and their landbase has informed some Westerners view of California&#x27;s &quot;wild Eden&quot;, which may influence policy decisions about the &quot;wilderness&quot;. Some academics assumed that the only pre-Colonial human interactions with nature were as &quot;hunter-gatherers&quot;. Others say that the relationship was one of &quot;calculated tempered use of nature as active agents of environmental change and stewardship&quot;. They argue that a view of &quot;wilderness&quot; as uninhabited nature has resulted in removal of Indigenous inhabitants to preserve &quot;the wild&quot;, and that depriving the land of traditional Indigenous practices such as controlled burns, harvesting, and seed scattering has yielded dense understory shrubbery or tickets of young trees which are inhospitable to life. Recent studies indicate that Indigenous peoples used land sustainably, without causing substantial losses of biodiversity, for thousands of years.

A goal is to ascertain an unbiased view of Indigenous practices of resource management. Historical literature, archaeological findings, ecological field studies, and Native Peoples&#x27; cultures show indications that Indigenous land management practices were largely successful in promoting habitat heterogeneity, increasing biodiversity, and maintaining certain vegetation types, sustaining human lives while conserving natural resources.

Recently, it has come to light that the deforestation rate of Indonesian rainforests has been far greater than estimated. Such a rate could not have been the product of globalization as understood before; rather, it seemed that ordinary local people dependent on these forests for their livelihoods are in fact &quot;joining distant corporations in creating uninhabitable landscapes.&quot;

In eastern Penan, three categories of misrepresentation are noticeable: The Molong concept is purely a stewardship notion of resource management. Communities or individuals take ownership of specific trees, maintaining and harvesting from them sustainably over a long period of time. Some feel this practice has been romanticized in environmentalist writings. Landscape features and particularly their names in local languages provided geographical and historical information for Penan people; whereas in environmentalist accounts, it has turned into a spiritual practice where trees and rivers represent forest spirits that are sacred to the Penan people. A typical stereotype of some environmentalists&#x27; approach to ecological ethnography is to present Indigenous &quot;knowledge&quot; of nature as &quot;valuable&quot; to the outside world because of its hidden medicinal benefits. In reality, eastern Penan populations do not identify a medicinal stream of &quot;knowledge&quot;. These misrepresentations in the &quot;narrative&quot; of Indigeneity and &quot;value&quot; of Indigenous knowledge might have been helpful for Penan&#x27;s people in their struggle to protect their environment, but it might also have disastrous consequences. What happens if another case did not fit in this romantic narrative, or another Indigenous knowledge did not seem beneficial to the outside world. These people were being uprooted in the first place because their communities did not fit well with the state&#x27;s system of values.

At the 2024 United Nations Biodiversity Conference (COP16), Nations agreed to a new permanent body for Indigenous peoples, which will allow them to advise and offer their view at biodiversity COPs directly.

==Indigenous peoples by region==
Indigenous populations are distributed in regions throughout the globe. The numbers, condition and experience of Indigenous groups may vary widely within a given region. A comprehensive survey is further complicated by sometimes contentious membership and identification.

===Africa===


==== Sub-Saharan Africa ====
In the postcolonial period, the concept of specific Indigenous peoples within the African continent has gained wider acceptance, although not without controversy. The highly diverse and numerous ethnic groups that comprise most modern, independent African states contain within them various peoples whose situation, cultures and pastoralist or hunter-gatherer lifestyles are generally marginalized and set apart from the dominant political and economic structures of the nation. Since the late 20th century these peoples have increasingly sought recognition of their rights as distinct Indigenous peoples, in both national and international contexts.

Though the vast majority of African peoples are &quot;indigenous&quot; in the sense that they originate from that continent, in practice, identity as an &quot;Indigenous people&quot; per the modern definition is more restrictive, and certainly not every African ethnic group claims identification under these terms. Groups and communities who do claim this recognition are those who, by a variety of historical and environmental circumstances, have been placed outside of the dominant state systems, and whose traditional practices and land claims often come into conflict with the objectives and policies implemented by governments, companies and surrounding dominant societies.

==== North Africa ====
The indigenous peoples of North Africa predominantly comprise the Berbers in the Maghreb and the Copts and Nubians in the Nile Valley. The vast majority of them have been Arabized after the Islamic conquests under the Rashidun and Umayyad caliphates.

===Americas===


Indigenous peoples of the Americas are broadly recognized as being those groups and their descendants who inhabited the region before the arrival of European colonizers and settlers (i.e., pre-Columbian). Indigenous peoples who maintain, or seek to maintain, traditional ways of life are found from the high Arctic north to the southern extremities of Tierra del Fuego.

The impacts of historical and ongoing European colonization of the Americas on Indigenous communities have been in general quite severe, with many authorities estimating ranges of significant population decline primarily due to disease, land theft and violence. Several peoples have become extinct, or very nearly so. But there are and have been many thriving and resilient Indigenous nations and communities.

==== North America ====
North America is sometimes referred to by Indigenous peoples as Abya Yala or Turtle Island.

In Mexico, about 11 million people, or 9% of Mexico&#x27;s total population, self-reported as Indigenous in 2015, making it the country with the highest Indigenous population in North America. In the southern states of Oaxaca (65.73%) and Yucatán (65.40%), the majority of the population is Indigenous, as reported in 2015. Other states with high populations of Indigenous peoples include Campeche (44.54%), Quintana Roo, (44.44%), Hidalgo, (36.21%), Chiapas (36.15%), Puebla (35.28%), and Guerrero (33.92%).

Indigenous peoples in Canada comprise the First Nations, Inuit and Métis. The descriptors &quot;Indian&quot; and &quot;Eskimo&quot; have fallen into disuse in Canada. More currently, the term &quot;Aboriginal&quot; is being replaced with &quot;Indigenous&quot;. Several national organizations in Canada changed their names from &quot;Aboriginal&quot; to &quot;Indigenous&quot;. Most notable was the change of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC) to Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) in 2015, which then split into Indigenous Services Canada and Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Development Canada in 2017. According to the 2016 Census, there are around 1,670,000 Indigenous people in Canada. There are currently over 600 recognized First Nations governments or bands spread across Canada, such as the Cree, Mohawk, Mikmaq, Blackfoot, Coast Salish, Innu, Dene and more, with distinctive Indigenous cultures, languages, art, and music. First Nations peoples signed 11 numbered treaties across much of what is now known as Canada between 1871 and 1921, except in parts of British Columbia.

The Inuit have achieved a degree of administrative autonomy with the creation in 1999 of the territories of Nunavik (in Northern Quebec), Nunatsiavut (in Northern Labrador) and Nunavut, which was until 1999 a part of the Northwest Territories. The autonomous territory of Greenland within the Kingdom of Denmark is also home to a recognized Indigenous and majority population of Inuit (about 85%) who settled the area in the 13th century, displacing the Indigenous European Greenlandic Norse.

In the United States, the combined populations of Native Americans, Inuit and other Indigenous designations totaled 2,786,652 (constituting about 1.5% of 2003 U.S. census figures). Some 563 scheduled tribes are recognized at the federal level, and a number of others recognized at the state level.

==== Central and South America ====
In some countries (particularly in Latin America), Indigenous peoples form a sizable component of the overall national populationin Bolivia, they account for an estimated 56–70% of the total nation, and at least half of the population in Guatemala and the Andean and Amazonian nations of Peru. In English, Indigenous peoples are collectively referred to by different names that vary by region, age and ethnicity of speakers, with no one term being universally accepted. While still in use in-group, and in many names of organizations, &quot;Indian&quot; is less popular among younger people, who tend to prefer &quot;Indigenous&quot; or simply &quot;Native, with most preferring to use the specific name of their tribe or Nation instead of generalities. In Spanish or Portuguese speaking countries, one finds the use of terms such as índios, &quot;pueblos &quot;, &quot;amerindios&quot;, &quot;povos nativos&quot;, &quot;povos indígenas&quot;, and, in Peru, &quot;Comunidades Nativas&quot; (Native Communities), particularly among Amazonian societies like the Urarina and Matsés. In Chile, there the most populous indigenous peoples are the Mapuche in the Center-South and the Aymaras in the North. Rapa Nui of Easter Island, who are a Polynesian people, are the only non-Amerindian indigenous people in Chile.

Indigenous peoples make up 0.4% of all Brazilian population, or about 700,000 people. Indigenous peoples are found in the entire territory of Brazil, although the majority of them live in Indian reservations in the North and Center-Western part of the country. On 18 January 2007, FUNAI reported that it had confirmed the presence of 67 different uncontacted peoples in Brazil, up from 40 in 2005. With this addition Brazil has now overtaken the island of New Guinea as the country having the largest number of uncontacted peoples.

===Asia===


====West Asia====
* Armenians are the Indigenous people of the Armenian Highlands. There are currently more Armenians living outside their ancestral homeland because of the Armenian genocide of 1915.
* Anatolian Greeks, including the Pontic Greeks and Cappadocian Greeks, are the Greek-speaking minorities that existed in Anatolia millennia before Turkic conquest. They are indigenous to Asiatic Turkey. Most were either killed in the Greek genocide or displaced during the following population exchange; however, some remain in Turkey. There has been a Greek presence in Anatolia since at least the 1000s BCE, and Greek traders visited western Anatolia beginning in 1900 BCE.
* Assyrians are indigenous to Mesopotamia. They claim descent from the ancient Neo-Assyrian Empire, and lived in what was Assyria, their original homeland, and still speak dialects of Aramaic, the official language of the Assyrian Empire.
* Copts are an ethnoreligious group, indigenous to Egypt and parts of the Sudan and Libya, one of the oldest Christian communities in the world.
* Kurds are one of the Indigenous peoples of Mesopotamia.
* Yazidis are indigenous to Upper Mesopotamia.

Due to changes in the demographic history of Palestine, there are competing claims that Jews and Palestinian Arabs are indigenous to the region. The argument entered the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, with Jews claiming indigeneity, citing historical and religious connections to the land as their ancient homeland. Palestinians claim Indigenous status as a pre-existing population displaced by Jewish settlement, and currently constituting a minority in the State of Israel. In 2007, the Negev Bedouin were officially recognized as Indigenous peoples of Israel by the United Nations. This has been criticized both by scholars associated with the Israeli state, who dispute the Bedouin&#x27;s claim to indigeneity, and those who argue that recognizing just one group of Palestinians as indigenous risks undermining others&#x27; claims and &quot;fetishizing&quot; nomadic cultures.

====South Asia====
India&#x27;s Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Indian Ocean are also home to several Indigenous groups such as the Andamanese of Strait Island, the Jarawas of Middle Andaman and South Andaman Islands, the Onge of Little Andaman Island and the uncontacted Sentinelese of North Sentinel Island.

In Sri Lanka, the Indigenous Vedda people constitute a small minority of the population today.
====Northeast Asia====
Ainu people are an ethnic group indigenous to Hokkaidō, the Kuril Islands, and much of Sakhalin. As Japanese settlement expanded, the Ainu were pushed northward and fought against the Japanese in Shakushain&#x27;s Revolt and Menashi–Kunashir Rebellion, until by the Meiji period they were confined by the government to a reservation near Lake Akan in Hokkaidō. In a ground-breaking 1997 decision involving the Ainu people of Japan, the Japanese courts recognized their claim in law, stating that &quot;If one minority group lived in an area prior to being ruled over by a majority group and preserved its distinct ethnic culture even after being ruled over by the majority group, while another came to live in an area ruled over by a majority after consenting to the majority rule, it must be recognized that it is only natural that the distinct ethnic culture of the former group requires greater consideration.&quot;

The Dzungar Oirats are indigenous to the Dzungaria in Northern Xinjiang.

The Sarikoli Pamiris are indigenous to Tashkurgan in Xinjiang.

The Tibetans are indigenous to Tibet.

The Ryukyuan people are indigenous to the Ryukyu Islands.

The languages of Taiwanese aborigines have significance in historical linguistics, since in all likelihood Taiwan was the place of origin of the entire Austronesian language family, which spread across Oceania.

In Hong Kong, the indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories are defined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration as people descended through the male line from a person who was in 1898, before Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory. There are several different groups that make up the indigenous inhabitants, the Punti, Hakka, Hoklo, and Tanka. All are nonetheless considered part of the Cantonese majority, although some like the Tanka have been shown to have genetic and anthropological roots in the Baiyue people, the pre-Han Chinese inhabitants of Southern China.

The Russians invaded Siberia and conquered the indigenous people in the 17th–18th centuries.

Nivkh people are an ethnic group indigenous to Sakhalin, having a few speakers of the Nivkh language, but their fisher culture has been endangered due to the development of oil field of Sakhalin from 1990s.

In Russia, definition of &quot;Indigenous peoples&quot; is contested largely referring to a number of population (less than 50,000 people), and neglecting self-identification, origin from indigenous populations who inhabited the country or region upon invasion, colonization or establishment of state frontiers, distinctive social, economic and cultural institutions. Thus, indigenous peoples of Russia such as Sakha, Komi, Karelian and others are not considered as such due to the size of the population (more than 50,000 people), and consequently they &quot;are not the subjects of the specific legal protections.&quot; The Russian government recognizes only 40 ethnic groups as indigenous peoples, even though there are 30 other groups to be counted as such. The reason of nonrecognition is the size of the population and relatively late advent to their current regions, thus indigenous peoples in Russia should be numbered less than 50,000 people.

====Southeast Asia====

The Malay Singaporeans are the Indigenous people of Singapore, inhabiting it since the Austronesian migration. They had established the Kingdom of Singapura back in the 13th century. The name &quot;Singapore&quot; is an anglicisation of the Malay name &quot;Singapura&quot; which is derived from the Sanskrit word for &#x27;lion city&#x27;. The native Malay name for the main island of Singapore is &quot;Pulau Ujong&quot;.

Dayak People are one of the Indigenous groups of Borneo. It is a loose term for over 200 riverine and hill-dwelling ethnic groups, located in Borneo, each with its own dialect, customs, laws, territory, and culture, although common distinguishing traits are readily identifiable.

The Cham are the Indigenous people of the former state of Champa which was conquered by Vietnam in the Cham–Vietnamese wars during Nam tiến. The Cham in Vietnam are only recognized as a minority, and not as an Indigenous people by the Vietnamese government despite being indigenous to the region.

The Degar (Montagnards) are indigenous to Central Highlands (Vietnam) and were conquered by the Vietnamese in the Nam tiến.

The Khmer Krom are the Indigenous people of the Mekong Delta and Saigon which were acquired by Vietnam from Cambodian King Chey Chettha II in exchange for a Vietnamese princess.

In Indonesia, there are 50 to 70 million people who are classified as Indigenous peoples by the local Indigenous rights advocacy group &quot;Aliansi Masyarakat Adat Nusantara&quot;. However, the Indonesian government does not recognize the existence of indigenous peoples, classifying every Native Indonesian ethnic group as &quot;indigenous&quot; despite the clear cultural distinctions of certain groups. This problem is shared by many other countries in the ASEAN region.

In the Philippines, there are 135 ethno-linguistic groups, 110 of which are considered as Indigenous peoples by the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples. The Indigenous people of Cordillera Administrative Region and Cagayan Valley in the Philippines are the Igorot people. The Indigenous peoples of Mindanao are the Lumad peoples and the Moro (Tausug, Maguindanao Maranao and others) who also live in the Sulu archipelago. There are also others sets of Indigenous peoples in Palawan, Mindoro, Visayas, and the rest central and south Luzon. The country has one of the largest Indigenous peoples population in the world. The recognition of the rights of Indigenous peoples was legally enshrined in 1997 with the Indigenous Peoples&#x27; Rights Act.

In Myanmar, indigenous peoples include the Shan, the Karen, the Rakhine, the Karenni, the Chin, the Kachin and the Mon. However, there are more ethnic groups that are considered indigenous, for example, the Akha, the Lisu, the Lahu or the Mru, among others.

===Europe===

Various ethnic groups have lived in Europe for millennia. However, the concept of Indigenous peoples is rarely used in the European context.

Indigenous minority populations in Europe include the Sámi peoples of northern Norway, Sweden, and Finland and northwestern Russia (in an area also referred to as Sápmi); the Nenets of northern Russia, and the Inuit of Greenland, and the Irish travelers (also referred to as Pavees or Mincérs) of Ireland. Some sources describe the Sámi as the only recognized Indigenous peoples in Europe, with others describing them as the only Indigenous people in the European Union.

Other groups, particularly in Central, Western and Southern Europe, that might be considered to fit the description of Indigenous peoples in the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989, such as the Sorbs, are generally categorized as national minorities instead.

===Oceania===

==== Australia ====

In Australia, the Indigenous populations are the Aboriginal Australian peoples (comprising many different nations and language groups) and the Torres Strait Islander peoples (also with sub-groups). These two groups are often referred to as Indigenous Australians, although terms such as First Nations and First Peoples are also used.

==== Pacific Islands ====
Polynesian, Melanesian and Micronesian peoples originally populated many of the present-day Pacific Island countries in the Oceania region over the course of thousands of years. European, American, Chilean and Japanese colonial expansion in the Pacific brought many of these areas under non-Indigenous administration, mainly during the 19th century. During the 20th century, several of these former colonies gained independence and nation-states formed under local control. However, various peoples have put forward claims for Indigenous recognition where their islands are still under external administration; examples include the Chamorros of Guam and the Northern Marianas, and the Marshallese of the Marshall Islands. Some islands remain under administration from Paris, Washington, London or Wellington.

The remains of at least 25 miniature humans, who lived between 1,000 and 3,000 years ago, were recently found on the islands of Palau in Micronesia.

In most parts of Oceania, Indigenous peoples outnumber the descendants of colonists. Exceptions include Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii. In New Zealand, based on various factors including census data and self-identification, the proportion of full or part Māori of the population on 30 June 2021 was estimated to be 17%. Māori developed from Polynesian people who settled in New Zealand after migrations from other Pacific islands, probably in the 13th century. Many leaders of Māori nations (iwi) signed a written agreement with the British Crown in 1840, known as the Treaty of Waitangi.

A majority of the Papua New Guinea population is Indigenous, with more than 700 different nationalities recognized in a total population of 8 million. The country&#x27;s constitution and key statutes identify traditional or custom-based practices and land tenure, and explicitly set out to promote the viability of these traditional societies within the modern state. However, conflicts and disputes concerning land use and resource rights continue between indigenous groups, the government, and corporate entities.

==Indigenous rights and other issues==


The 1989 ILO Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples mainly concerns non-discrimination but also covers indigenous peoples&#x27; rights to development, customary laws, lands, territories and resources, employment, education and health. By 2013, the convention had been ratified by 22 countries, mainly in Latin America.

In 2007, the United Nations (UN) adopted a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) specifying the collective rights of Indigenous peoples, including their rights to self-determination and to protect their cultures, identities, languages, ceremonies, and access to employment, health, education and natural resources. The declaration is not a formally binding treaty but some provisions might be considered customary international law. The declaration has been endorsed by at least 148 states but its provisions have not been consistently implemented.

Indigenous peoples confront a diverse range of concerns associated with their status and interaction with other cultural groups, as well as changes in their inhabited environment. Some challenges are specific to particular groups; however, other challenges are commonly experienced.

Wherever Indigenous cultural identity is asserted, common societal issues and concerns arise. These concerns are often not unique to Indigenous groups. Despite the diversity of Indigenous peoples, they share common problems and issues in dealing with the prevailing, or invading, society. They are generally concerned that the cultures and lands of Indigenous peoples are being lost and that Indigenous peoples suffer both discrimination and pressure to assimilate into the surrounding or colonizing societies. This is borne out by the fact that the lands and cultures of nearly all of the peoples listed at the end of this article are under threat. Notable exceptions are the Sakha and Komi peoples (two northern Indigenous peoples of Russia), who now control their own autonomous republics within the Russian state, and the Canadian Inuit, who form a majority of the territory of Nunavut (created in 1999). Despite the control of their territories, many Sakha people have lost their lands as a result of the Russian Homestead Act, which allows any Russian citizen to own any land in the Far Eastern region of Russia.

In Australia, a landmark case, &quot;Mabo&quot; v &quot;Queensland&quot; (No 2), saw the High Court of Australia reject the idea of . This rejection ended up recognizing that there was a pre-existing system of law practiced by the Meriam people.

A 2009 United Nations publication says:Although indigenous peoples are often portrayed as a hindrance to development, their cultures and traditional knowledge are also increasingly seen as assets. It is argued that it is important for the human species as a whole to preserve as wide a range of cultural diversity as possible, and that the protection of indigenous cultures is vital to this enterprise.

===Human rights violations===

According to Samuel Totten, some governments do not respect the rights of Indigenous peoples. In the latter part of the twentieth century the genocide of Indigenous peoples in Australia and Namibia attracted more attention from the international community including scholars and human rights organizations.

The Bangladeshi government has stated that there are &quot;no indigenous peoples in Bangladesh&quot;. This statement has angered the Indigenous peoples of Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh, collectively known as the Jumma. Experts have protested against this move of the Bangladesh government and have questioned the government&#x27;s definition of the term &quot;indigenous peoples&quot;. This move by the Bangladesh government is seen by the Indigenous peoples of Bangladesh as another step by the Government to further erode their already limited rights.

Hindu Chams and Muslim Chams have both experienced religious and ethnic persecution and restrictions on their faith under the current Vietnamese government, with the Vietnamese state confiscating Cham property and forbidding Cham from observing their religious beliefs. Hindu temples were turned into tourist sites against the wishes of the Cham Hindus. In 2010 and 2013 several incidents occurred in Thành Tín and Phươc Nhơn villages where Cham were murdered by Vietnamese. In 2012, Vietnamese police in Chau Giang village stormed into a Cham Mosque, stole the electric generator, and also raped Cham girls. Cham in the Mekong Delta have also been economically marginalized, with ethnic Vietnamese settling on land previously owned by Cham people with state support.

The Indonesian government has outright denied the existence of Indigenous peoples within the countries&#x27; borders. In 2012, Indonesia stated that &#x27;The Government of Indonesia supports the promotion and protection of indigenous people worldwide ... Indonesia, however, does not recognize the application of the indigenous peoples concept ... in the country&#x27;. Along with the brutal treatment of the country&#x27;s Papuan people (a conservative estimate places the violent deaths at 100,000 people in West New Guinea since Indonesian occupation in 1963, see Papua conflict) has led to Survival International condemning Indonesia for treating its Indigenous peoples as the worst in the world.

The Vietnamese viewed and dealt with the Indigenous Montagnards from the Central Highlands of Vietnam as &quot;savages&quot;, which caused a Montagnard uprising against the Vietnamese. The Vietnamese were originally centered around the Red River Delta but engaged in conquest and seized new lands such as Champa, the Mekong Delta (from Cambodia) and the Central Highlands during Nam Tien. While the Vietnamese received strong Chinese influence in their culture and civilization and were Sinicized, and the Cambodians and Laotians were Indianized, the Montagnards in the Central Highlands maintained their own Indigenous culture without adopting external culture and were the true Indigenous of the region. To hinder encroachment on the Central Highlands by Vietnamese nationalists, the term &quot;Pays Montagnard du Sud-Indochinois&quot; (PMSI) emerged for the Central Highlands along with the indigenous being addressed by the name Montagnard. The tremendous scale of Vietnamese Kinh colonists flooding into the Central Highlands has significantly altered the demographics of the region. The anti-ethnic minority discriminatory policies by the Vietnamese, environmental degradation, deprivation of lands from the Indigenous people, and settlement of Indigenous lands by an overwhelming number of Vietnamese settlers led to massive protests and demonstrations by the Central Highland&#x27;s indigenous ethnic minorities against the Vietnamese in January–February 2001. This event gave a tremendous blow to the claim often published by the Vietnamese government that in Vietnam &quot;There has been no ethnic confrontation, no religious war, no ethnic conflict. And no elimination of one culture by another.&quot;

In May 2016, the Fifteenth Session of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) affirmed that Indigenous peoples are distinctive groups protected in international or national legislation as having a set of specific rights based on their linguistic and historical ties to a particular territory, prior to later settlement, development or occupation of a region. The session affirms that, since Indigenous peoples are vulnerable to exploitation, marginalization, oppression, forced assimilation, and genocide by nation states formed from colonizing populations or by different, politically dominant ethnic groups, individuals and communities maintaining ways of life indigenous to their regions are entitled to special protection.

The Indigenous people from Tanzania&#x27;s Maasai community were reportedly subjected to eviction from their ancestral land to make way for a luxury game reserve by Otterlo Business Corporation in June 2022. The game reserve was reportedly being set up for the royals of the United Arab Emirates also linked to OBC or the Otterlo Business Corporation. According to lawyers and human rights groups and activists, approximately 30 Maasai people were injured by security forces in the process of eviction and delimiting a land area of . A 2019 UN report has described OBC as a &#x27;UAE-based&#x27; luxury-game hunting company, granted a license to hunt by the Tanzanian government in 1992 for &quot;the UAE royal family to organize private hunting trips&quot;, denying the Maasai people access to their own land.

===Health issues===

In December 1993, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed the International Decade of the World&#x27;s Indigenous People, and requested UN specialized agencies to consider with governments and indigenous people how they can contribute to the success of the Decade of Indigenous People, commencing in December 1994. As a consequence, the World Health Organization (WHO), at its Forty-seventh World Health Assembly, established a core advisory group of Indigenous representatives with special knowledge of the health needs and resources of their communities, thus beginning a long-term commitment to the issue of the health of Indigenous peoples.

The WHO noted in 2003 that &quot;Statistical data on the health status of indigenous peoples is scarce. This is especially notable for indigenous peoples in Africa, Asia and eastern Europe&quot;, but snapshots from various countries (where such statistics are available) show that indigenous people are in worse health than the general population, in advanced and developing countries alike: higher incidence of diabetes in some regions of Australia; higher prevalence of poor sanitation and lack of safe water among Twa households in Rwanda; a greater prevalence of childbirths without prenatal care among ethnic minorities in Vietnam; suicide rates among Inuit youth in Canada are eleven times higher than the national average; infant mortality rates are higher for Indigenous peoples everywhere.

The first UN publication on the State of the World&#x27;s Indigenous Peoples revealed alarming statistics about indigenous peoples&#x27; health. Health disparities between indigenous and non-indigenous populations are evident in both developed and developing countries. Native Americans in the United States are 600 times more likely to acquire tuberculosis and 62% more likely to commit suicide than the non-Indian population. Tuberculosis, obesity, and type 2 diabetes are major health concerns for the indigenous in developed countries. Globally, health disparities touch upon nearly every health issue, including HIV/AIDS, cancer, malaria, cardiovascular disease, malnutrition, parasitic infections, and respiratory diseases, affecting indigenous peoples at much higher rates. Many causes of Indigenous children&#x27;s mortality could be prevented. Poorer health conditions amongst indigenous peoples result from longstanding societal issues, such as extreme poverty and racism, but also the intentional marginalization and dispossession of Indigenous peoples by dominant, non-Indigenous populations and societal structures.

===Racism and discrimination===

Indigenous peoples have frequently been subjected to various forms of racism and discrimination. Indigenous peoples have been denoted as being &quot;barbaric&quot;, &quot;primitive&quot;, &quot;savage&quot; or &quot;uncivilized&quot;. These terms were commonly used during the heyday of European colonial expansion, and they are still being used by certain societies in modern times.

During the 17th century, Europeans commonly labeled Indigenous peoples &quot;uncivilized&quot;. Some philosophers, such as Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679), considered Indigenous people mere &quot;savages&quot;. Others (especially literary figures in the 18th century) popularized the concept of &quot;noble savages&quot;. Those who were close to the Hobbesian view tended to believe that they had a duty to &quot;civilize&quot; and &quot;modernize&quot; the Indigenous.

Survival International runs a campaign to stamp out media portrayals of Indigenous peoples as &quot;primitives&quot; or &quot;savages&quot;.

After World War I (1914–1918), many Europeans came to doubt the morality of the means which were used to &quot;civilize&quot; peoples. At the same time, the anti-colonial movement, and advocates for the rights of Indigenous peoples, argued that words such as &quot;civilized&quot; and &quot;savage&quot; were products and tools of colonialism, and they also argued that colonialism itself was savagely destructive. In the mid-20th century, European attitudes began to shift to the view that Indigenous and tribal peoples are the only peoples who should have the right to decide what should happen to their ancient cultures and their ancestral lands.

=== Cultural appropriation ===
New Age and Neopagan adherents often look to the cultures of Indigenous peoples seeking to find ancient traditional truths and spiritual practices to appropriate into their lifestyles and worldviews.

=== Environmental injustice ===
 At an international level, Indigenous peoples have received increased recognition of their environmental rights since 2002, but few countries respect these rights in reality. The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, adopted by the General Assembly in 2007, established Indigenous peoples&#x27; right to self-determination, stating rights to manage natural resources, and cultural and intellectual property. In countries where these rights are recognized, land titling and demarcation procedures are often put on delay, or leased out by the state as concessions for extractive industries without consulting Indigenous communities.

Many in the United States federal government are in favor of exploiting oil reserves in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, where the Gwich&#x27;in Indigenous people rely on herds of caribou. Oil drilling could destroy thousands of years of culture for the Gwich&#x27;in. On the other hand, some of the Inupiat people, from another Indigenous community in the region, favor oil drilling because they could benefit economically.

The introduction of industrial agricultural technologies such as fertilizers, pesticides, and large plantation schemes have destroyed ecosystems that Indigenous communities formerly depended on, forcing resettlement. Development projects such as dam construction, pipelines and resource extraction have displaced large numbers of Indigenous peoples, often without providing compensation. Governments have forced Indigenous peoples off of their ancestral lands in the name of ecotourism and national park development. Indigenous women are especially affected by land dispossession because they must walk longer distances for water and fuel wood. These women also become economically dependent on men when they lose their livelihoods. Indigenous groups asserting their rights has most often resulted in torture, imprisonment, or death.

The building of dams can hurt Indigenous peoples by hurting the ecosystems that provide them water, food. For example, the Munduruku people in the Amazon rainforest are opposing the building of Tapajós dam with the help of Greenpeace.

Most Indigenous populations are already subject to the deleterious effects of climate change. Climate change has not only environmental, but also human rights and socioeconomic implications for Indigenous communities. The World Bank acknowledges climate change as an obstacle to Millennium Development Goals, notably the fight against poverty, disease, and child mortality, in addition to environmental sustainability.

=== Use of indigenous knowledge ===
Indigenous knowledge is considered as very important for issues linked with sustainability. Indigenous peoples play an essential role in conserving biodiversity around the world. An oft-cited statistic is that Indigenous peoples steward lands which comprise 80% of the world&#x27;s biodiversity. In 2024, Fernández-Llamazares et al. investigated the origin of this claim in &quot;Nature&quot; and found that it is without basis, also stating that &quot;biodiversity&quot; is broad and not precisely defineable, and that the claim may do more harm than good. With a specific description, such as &quot;natural lands&quot; (that being lands with low levels of ecological disturbance), it can be said that at least 37% of remaining natural lands fall within the territories of Indigenous peoples. Fernández-Llamazares et al. state that the 80% claim &quot;could undermine these and other rigorous studies — as well as effective efforts to conserve biodiversity by Indigenous Peoples on the ground&quot;.

The Western and Eastern Penan people are two major groups of Indigenous populations in Malaysia. The Eastern Penan are famous for their resistance to loggers threatening their natural resources, specifically Sago palms and various fruit bearing trees. Because of the Penan&#x27;s international fame, environmentalists often visited the area to document such happenings and learn more about and from the people there, including their perspective on the land&#x27;s invasion. 

Environmentalists such as Davis and Henley, who Brosius writes lumped all native groups of Malaysia into one homogeneous group with the same ideas and traditions, and lacked dialectical connections needed to deeply understand the Penan, lacked full knowledge of the situation&#x27;s specific weight to the Indigenous peoples. The two embarked on a mission, stating they wished to help with conservation of the Penan&#x27;s land resources, but Brosious states they were among the many who repackaged traditional knowledge into something that fit a Western narrative and agenda, and that Davis and Henley romanticized and misconstrued the traditional Penan concept of molong (meaning: &quot;to preserve&quot;the Penan marked trees for personal use and to preserve them for future harvesting of fruits or for materials).

Another common occurrence is to extend Indigenous knowledge beyond its limits and into unrelated meanings that western consumers find spiritually profound. This tendency of journalists extends beyond Davis and Henley. It serves non-Natives to add a narrative and value beyond that which already exists within the knowledge base of Indigenous peoples. Not only do these fictionalized accounts of some Indigenous knowledge and traditions skew the beliefs of onlookers, but they also contribute to cultural genocide as the actual spiritual and religious beliefs of the Indigenous people are disappeared and replaced with the westernized fiction.

<text>The bonobo (; Pan paniscus), also historically called the pygmy chimpanzee (less often the dwarf chimpanzee or gracile chimpanzee), is an endangered great ape and one of the two species making up the genus &quot;Pan&quot; (the other being the common chimpanzee, &quot;Pan troglodytes&quot;). While bonobos are, today, recognized as a distinct species in their own right, they were initially thought to be a subspecies of &quot;Pan troglodytes&quot;, because of the physical similarities between the two species. Taxonomically, members of the chimpanzee/bonobo subtribe Panina—composed entirely by the genus &quot;Pan&quot;—are collectively termed &quot;panins&quot;.

Bonobos are distinguished from common chimpanzees by relatively long limbs, pinker lips, a darker face, a tail-tuft through adulthood, and parted, longer hair on their heads. Some individuals have sparser, thin hair over parts of their bodies. The bonobo is found in a area within the Congo Basin of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Central Africa. It is predominantly frugivorous, compared to the often highly omnivorous diets and hunting of small monkeys, duiker and other antelope exhibited by common chimpanzees. Bonobos inhabit primary and secondary forest, including seasonally inundated swamp forest. Because of political instability in the region, and the general timidity of bonobos, there has been relatively little field work done observing the species in its natural habitat.

According to studies published in 2017 by researchers at The George Washington University, the ancestors of the genus &quot;Pan&quot; split from the human line about 8 million years ago; moreover, bonobos split from the common chimpanzee line about 2 million years ago.

Along with the common chimpanzee, the bonobo is the closest extant relative to humans. As the two species are not proficient swimmers, the natural formation of the Congo River (around 1.5–2 million years ago) possibly led to the isolation and speciation of the bonobo. Bonobos live south of the river, and thereby were separated from the ancestors of the common chimpanzee, which live north of the river. There are no concrete figures regarding population, but the estimate is between 29,500 and 50,000 individuals. The species is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List and is most threatened by habitat destruction, human population growth and movement (as well as ongoing civil unrest and political infighting), with commercial poaching being, by far, the most prominent threat. Bonobos typically live 40 years in captivity; their lifespan in the wild is unknown, but it is almost certainly much shorter.

== Etymology ==
Formerly the bonobo was known as the &quot;pygmy chimpanzee&quot;, despite the bonobo having a similar body size to the common chimpanzee. The name &quot;pygmy&quot; was given by the German zoologist Ernst Schwarz in 1929, who classified the species on the basis of a previously mislabeled bonobo cranium, noting its diminutive size compared to chimpanzee skulls.

The name &quot;bonobo&quot; first appeared in 1954, when Austrian zoologist Eduard Paul Tratz and German biologist Heinz Heck proposed it as a new and separate generic term for pygmy chimpanzees. The name is thought to derive from a misspelling on a shipping crate from the town of Bolobo on the Congo River near the location from which the first bonobo specimens were collected in the 1920s.

== Taxonomy ==
The bonobo was first recognised as a distinct taxon in 1928 by German anatomist Ernst Schwarz, based on a skull in the Tervuren Museum in Belgium which had previously been classified as a juvenile chimpanzee (&quot;Pan troglodytes&quot;). Schwarz published his findings in 1929, classifying the bonobo as a subspecies of chimpanzee, &quot;Pan satyrus paniscus&quot;. In 1933, American anatomist Harold Coolidge elevated it to species status. Major behavioural differences between bonobos and chimpanzees were first discussed in detail by Tratz and Heck in the early 1950s. Unaware of any taxonomic distinction with the common chimpanzee, American psychologist and primatologist Robert Yerkes had already noticed an unexpected major behavioural difference in the 1920s.

Bonobos and chimpanzees are the two species which make up the genus &quot;Pan&quot;, and are the closest living relatives to humans (&quot;Homo sapiens&quot;).

According to studies published in 2017 by researchers at The George Washington University, bonobos, along with common chimpanzees, split from the human line about 8 million years ago; moreover, bonobos split from the common chimpanzee line about 2 million years ago.

Nonetheless, the exact timing of the &quot;Pan&quot;–&quot;Homo&quot; last common ancestor is contentious, but DNA comparison suggests continual interbreeding between ancestral &quot;Pan&quot; and &quot;Homo&quot; groups, post-divergence, until about 4 million years ago. DNA evidence suggests the bonobo and common chimpanzee species diverged approximately 890,000–860,000 years ago following separation of these two populations possibly because of acidification and the spread of savannas at this time. Currently, these two species are separated by the Congo River, which had existed well before the divergence date, though ancestral &quot;Pan&quot; may have dispersed across the river using corridors which no longer exist. The first &quot;Pan&quot; fossils were reported in 2005 from the Middle Pleistocene (after the bonobo–chimpanzee split) of Kenya, alongside early &quot;Homo&quot; fossils.

According to A. Zihlman, bonobo body proportions closely resemble those of &quot;Australopithecus&quot;, leading evolutionary biologist Jeremy Griffith to suggest that bonobos may be a living example of our distant human ancestors. According to Australian anthropologists Gary Clark and Maciej Henneberg, human ancestors went through a bonobo-like phase featuring reduced aggression and associated anatomical changes, exemplified in &quot;Ardipithecus ramidus&quot;.

The first official publication of the sequencing and assembly of the bonobo genome was released in June 2012. The genome of a female bonobo from Leipzig Zoo was deposited with the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank) under the EMBL accession number AJFE01000000 after a previous analysis by the National Human Genome Research Institute confirmed that the bonobo genome is about 0.4% divergent from the chimpanzee genome.

=== Genetics and genomics ===

Relationships of bonobos to humans and other apes can be determined by comparing their genes or whole genomes. While the first bonobo genome was published in 2012, a high-quality reference genome became available only in 2021. The overall nucleotide divergence between chimpanzee and bonobo based on the latter is 0.421 ± 0.086% for autosomes and 0.311 ± 0.060% for the X chromosome. The reference genome predicts 22,366 full-length protein-coding genes and 9,066 noncoding genes, although cDNA sequencing confirmed only 20,478 protein-coding and 36,880 noncoding bonobo genes, similar to the number of genes annotated in the human genome. Overall, 206 and 1,576 protein-coding genes are part of gene families that contracted or expanded in the bonobo genome compared to the human genome, respectively, that is, these genes were lost or gained in the bonobo genome compared to humans.

=== Hybrids ===
Researchers have found that both central (&quot;Pan troglodytes troglodytes&quot;) and eastern chimpanzees (&quot;Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii&quot;) share more genetic material with bonobos than other chimpanzee subspecies. It is believed that genetic admixture has occurred at least two times within the past 550,000 years. In modern times hybridization between bonobos and chimpanzees in the wild is prevented as populations are allopatric and kept isolated on different sides of the Congo river.

Within captivity, hybrids between bonobos and chimpanzees have been recorded. Between 1990 and 1992, five pregnancies were conceived and studied between a male bonobo and two female chimpanzees. The two initial pregnancies were aborted because of environmental stressors. The following three pregnancies however led to the birth of three hybrid offspring.

A bonobo and chimpanzee hybrid called Tiby was also featured in the 2017 Swedish film &quot;The Square&quot;.

== Description ==

The bonobo is commonly considered to be more gracile than the common chimpanzee. Although large male chimpanzees can exceed any bonobo in bulk and weight, the two species broadly overlap in body size. Adult female bonobos are somewhat smaller than adult males. Body mass ranges from with an average weight of in males against an average of in females. The total length of bonobos (from the nose to the rump while on all fours) is . Male bonobos average when standing upright, compared to in females. The bonobo&#x27;s head is relatively smaller than that of the common chimpanzee with less prominent brow ridges above the eyes. It has a black face with pink lips, small ears, wide nostrils, and long hair on its head that forms a parting. Females have slightly more prominent breasts, in contrast to the flat breasts of other female apes, although not so prominent as those of humans. The bonobo also has a slim upper body, narrow shoulders, thin neck, and long legs when compared to the common chimpanzee.

Bonobos are both terrestrial and arboreal. Most ground locomotion is characterized by quadrupedal knuckle-walking. Bipedal walking has been recorded as less than 1% of terrestrial locomotion in the wild, a figure that decreased with habituation, while in captivity there is a wide variation. Bipedal walking in captivity, as a percentage of bipedal plus quadrupedal locomotion bouts, has been observed from 3.9% for spontaneous bouts to nearly 19% when abundant food is provided. These physical characteristics and its posture give the bonobo an appearance more closely resembling that of humans than the common chimpanzee does. The bonobo also has highly individuated facial features, as humans do, so that one individual may look significantly different from another, a characteristic adapted for visual facial recognition in social interaction.

Multivariate analysis has shown bonobos are more neotenized than the common chimpanzee, taking into account such features as the proportionately long torso length of the bonobo. Other researchers challenged this conclusion.

== Behavior ==

Primatologist Frans de Waal states bonobos are capable of altruism, compassion, empathy, kindness, patience, and sensitivity, and described &quot;bonobo society&quot; as a &quot;gynecocracy&quot;. Primatologists who have studied bonobos in the wild have documented a wide range of behaviors, including aggressive behavior and more cyclic sexual behavior similar to chimpanzees, even though bonobos show more sexual behavior in a greater variety of relationships. An analysis of female bonding among wild bonobos by Takeshi Furuichi stresses female sexuality and shows how female bonobos spend much more time in estrus than female chimpanzees.

Some primatologists have argued that de Waal&#x27;s data reflect only the behavior of captive bonobos, suggesting that wild bonobos show levels of aggression closer to what is found among chimpanzees. De Waal has responded that the contrast in temperament between bonobos and chimpanzees observed in captivity is meaningful, because it controls for the influence of environment. The two species behave quite differently even if kept under identical conditions. A 2014 study also found bonobos to be less aggressive than chimpanzees, particularly eastern chimpanzees. The authors argued that the relative peacefulness of western chimpanzees and bonobos was primarily due to ecological factors. Bonobos warn each other of danger less efficiently than chimpanzees in the same situation.

Nonetheless, on 12 April 2024, biologists reported that bonobos behave more aggressively than thought earlier.

In a study published in February 2025, scientists determined that bonobos could tell when humans didn&#x27;t know something. The findings advance researchers&#x27; proposal that like humans, chimpanzees and bonobos–humans’ closest evolutionary cousins–may also possess theory of mind. 

=== Social behavior ===
Bonobos are unusual among apes for their matriarchal social structure (extensive overlap between the male and female hierarchies leads some to refer to them as gender-balanced in their power structure). Bonobos do not have a defined territory and communities will travel over a wide range. Because of the nomadic nature of the females and evenly distributed food in their environment, males do not gain any obvious advantages by forming alliances with other males, or by defending a home range, as chimpanzees do. Female bonobos possess sharper canines than female chimpanzees, further fueling their status in the group. Although a male bonobo is dominant to a female in a dyadic interaction, depending on the community, socially-bonded females may be co-dominant with males or dominant over them, even to the extent that females can coerce reluctant males into mating with them.

At the top of the hierarchy is a coalition of high-ranking females and males typically headed by an old, experienced matriarch who acts as the decision-maker and leader of the group. Female bonobos typically earn their rank through experience, age, and ability to forge alliances with other females in their group, rather than physical intimidation, and top-ranking females will protect immigrant females from male harassment. While bonobos are often called matriarchal, and while every community is dominated by a female, some males will still obtain a high rank and act as coalitionary partners to the alpha female, often taking initiative in coordinating the groups movements. These males may outrank not only the other males in the group, but also many females. Certain males alert the group to any possible threats, protecting the group from predators such as pythons and leopards.

Aggressive encounters between males and females are rare, and males are tolerant of infants and juveniles. A male derives his status from the status of his mother. The mother–son bond often stays strong and continues throughout life. While social hierarchies do exist, and although the son of a high ranking female may outrank a lower female, rank plays a less prominent role than in other primate societies. Relationships between different communities are often positive and affiliative, and bonobos are not a territorial species. Bonobos will also share food with others, even unrelated strangers. Bonobos exhibit paedomorphism (retaining infantile physical characteristics and behaviours), which greatly inhibits aggression and enables unfamiliar bonobos to freely mingle and cooperate with each other.

Males engage in lengthy friendships with females and, in turn, female bonobos prefer to associate with and mate with males who are respectful and easygoing around them. Because female bonobos can use alliances to rebuff coercive and domineering males and select males at their own leisure, they show preference for males who are not aggressive towards them. Aging bonobos lose their playful streak and become noticeably more irritable in old age. Both sexes have a similar level of aggressiveness. Bonobos live in a male philopatric society where the females immigrate to new communities while males remain in their natal troop. However, it is not entirely unheard of for males to occasionally transfer into new groups. Additionally, females with powerful mothers may remain in their natal clan.

Alliances between males are poorly developed in most bonobo communities, while females will form alliances with each other and alliances between males and females occur, including multisex hunting parties. There is a confirmed case of a grown male bonobo adopting his orphaned infant brother. A mother bonobo will also support her grown son in conflicts with other males and help him secure better ties with other females, enhancing her chance of gaining grandchildren from him. She will even take measures such as physical intervention to prevent other males from breeding with certain females she wants her son to mate with. Although mothers play a role in aiding their sons, and the hierarchy among males is largely reflected by their mother&#x27;s social status, some motherless males will still successfully dominate some males who do have mothers.

Female bonobos have also been observed fostering infants from outside their established community. Bonobos are not known to kill each other, and are generally less violent than chimpanzees, yet aggression still manifests itself in this species. Although female bonobos dominate males and selectively mate with males who do not exhibit aggression toward them, competition between the males themselves is intense and high-ranking males secure more matings than low-ranking ones. Indeed, the size difference between males and females is more pronounced in bonobos than it is in chimpanzees, as male bonobos do not form alliances and therefore have little incentive to hold back when fighting for access to females. Male bonobos are known to attack each other and inflict serious injuries such as missing digits, damaged eyes and torn ears. Some of these injuries may also occur when a male threatens the high ranking females and is injured by them, as the larger male is swarmed and outnumbered by a female mob.

Because of the promiscuous mating behavior of female bonobos, a male cannot be sure which offspring are his. As a result, the entirety of parental care in bonobos is assumed by the mothers. However, bonobos are not as promiscuous as chimpanzees and slightly polygamous tendencies occur, with high-ranking males enjoying greater reproductive success than low-ranking males. Unlike chimpanzees, where any male can coerce a female into mating with him, female bonobos enjoy greater sexual preferences and can rebuff undesirable males, an advantage of female-female bonding, and actively seek out higher-ranking males.

Bonobo party size tends to vary because the groups exhibit a fission–fusion pattern. A community of approximately 100 will split into small groups during the day while looking for food, and then will come back together to sleep. They sleep in nests that they construct in trees. Female bonobos more often than not secure feeding privileges and feed before males do, and although they are rarely successful in one-on-one confrontations with males, a female bonobo with several allies supporting her has extremely high success in monopolizing food sources. Different communities favour different prey. In some communities females exclusively hunt and have a preference for rodents, in others both sexes hunt, and will target monkeys. In captive settings, females exhibit extreme food-based aggression towards males, and forge coalitions against them to monopolize specific food items, often going as far as to mutilate any males who fail to heed their warning. In wild settings, however, female bonobos will quietly ask males for food if they had gotten it first, instead of forcibly confiscating it, suggesting sex-based hierarchy roles are less rigid than in captive colonies. Female bonobos are known to lead hunts on duikers and successfully defend their bounty from marauding males in the wild. They are more tolerant of younger males pestering them yet exhibit heightened aggression towards older males.

In a study published in November 2023, scientists reported, for the first time, evidence that groups of primates, particularly bonobos, are capable of cooperating with each other. Researchers observed unprecedented cooperation between two distinct bonobo groups in the Congo&#x27;s Kokolopori Bonobo Reserve, Ekalakala and Kokoalongo, challenging traditional notions of ape societies. Over two years of observation, researchers witnessed 95 encounters between the groups. Contrary to expectations, these interactions resembled those within a single group. During these encounters, the bonobos engaged in behaviors such as grooming, food sharing, and collective defense against threats like snakes. Notably, the two groups, while displaying cooperative tendencies, maintained distinct identities, and there was no evidence of interbreeding or a blending of cultures. The cooperation observed was not arbitrary but evolved through individual bonds formed by exchanging favors and gifts. Some bonobos even formed alliances to target a third individual, demonstrating a nuanced social dynamic within the groups.

==== Sociosexual behaviour ====
Sexual activity generally plays a major role in bonobo society, being used as what some scientists perceive as a greeting, a means of forming social bonds, a means of conflict resolution, and postconflict reconciliation. Bonobos are the only non-human animal to have been observed engaging in tongue kissing. Bonobos and humans are the only primates to typically engage in face-to-face genital sex, although a pair of western gorillas has also been photographed in this position.

Bonobos do not form permanent monogamous sexual relationships with individual partners. They also do not seem to discriminate in their sexual behavior by sex or age, with the possible exception of abstaining from sexual activity between mothers and their adult sons. When bonobos come upon a new food source or feeding ground, the increased excitement will usually lead to communal sexual activity, presumably decreasing tension and encouraging peaceful feeding.

More often than the males, female bonobos engage in mutual genital-rubbing behavior, possibly to bond socially with each other, thus forming a female nucleus of bonobo society. The bonding among females enables them to dominate most of the males. Adolescent females often leave their native community to join another community. This migration mixes the bonobo gene pools, providing genetic diversity. Sexual bonding with other females establishes these new females as members of the group.

Bonobo clitorises are larger and more externalized than in most mammals; while the weight of a young adolescent female bonobo &quot;is maybe half&quot; that of a human teenager, she has a clitoris that is &quot;three times bigger than the human equivalent, and visible enough to waggle unmistakably as she walks&quot;. In scientific literature, the female–female behavior of bonobos pressing vulvas together is often referred to as genito-genital (GG) rubbing. This sexual activity happens within the immediate female bonobo community and sometimes outside of it. Ethologist Jonathan Balcombe stated that female bonobos rub their clitorises together rapidly for ten to twenty seconds, and this behavior, &quot;which may be repeated in rapid succession, is usually accompanied by grinding, shrieking, and clitoral engorgement&quot;; he added that it is estimated that they engage in this practice &quot;about once every two hours&quot; on average. As bonobos occasionally copulate face-to-face, &quot;evolutionary biologist Marlene Zuk has suggested that the position of the clitoris in bonobos and some other primates has evolved to maximize stimulation during sexual intercourse&quot;. The position of the clitoris may alternatively permit GG-rubbings, which has been hypothesized to function as a means for female bonobos to evaluate their intrasocial relationships.

Bonobo males engage in various forms of male–male genital behavior. The most common form of male–male mounting is similar to that of a heterosexual mounting: one of the males sits &quot;passively on his back [with] the other male thrusting on him&quot;, with the penises rubbing together because of both males&#x27; erections. In another, rarer form of genital rubbing, two bonobo males hang from a tree limb face-to-face while penis fencing. This also may occur when two males rub their penises together while in face-to-face position. Another form of genital interaction (rump rubbing) often occurs to express reconciliation between two males after a conflict, when they stand back-to-back and rub their scrotal sacs together, but such behavior also occurs outside agonistic contexts: Kitamura (1989) observed rump–rump contacts between adult males following sexual solicitation behaviors similar to those between female bonobos prior to GG-rubbing. Takayoshi Kano observed similar practices among bonobos in the natural habitat. Tongue kissing, oral sex, and genital massaging have also been recorded among male bonobos.

Wild females give birth for the first time at 13 or 14 years of age. Bonobo reproductive rates are no higher than those of the common chimpanzee. However, female bonobo oestrus periods are longer. During oestrus, females undergo a swelling of the perineal tissue lasting 10 to 20 days. The gestation period is on average 240 days. Postpartum amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) lasts less than one year and a female may resume external signs of oestrus within a year of giving birth, though the female is probably not fertile at this point. Female bonobos carry and nurse their young for four years and give birth on average every 4.6 years. Compared to common chimpanzees, bonobo females resume the genital swelling cycle much sooner after giving birth, enabling them to rejoin the sexual activities of their society. Also, bonobo females which are sterile or too young to reproduce still engage in sexual activity. Mothers will help their sons get more matings from females in oestrus.

Adult male bonobos have sex with infants, although without penetration. Adult females also have sex with infants, but less frequently. Infants are not passive participants. They quite often initiate contacts with both adult males and females, as well as with peers. They have also been shown to be sexually active even in the absence of any stimulation or learning from adults.

Infanticide, while well documented in chimpanzees, is apparently absent in bonobo society. Although infanticide has not been directly observed, there have been documented cases of both female and male bonobos kidnapping infants, sometimes resulting in infants dying from dehydration. Although male bonobos have not yet been seen to practice infanticide, there is a documented incident in captivity involving a dominant female abducting an infant from a lower-ranking female, treating the infant roughly and denying it the chance to suckle. During the kidnapping, the infant&#x27;s mother was clearly distressed and tried to retrieve her infant. Had the zookeepers not intervened, the infant almost certainly would have died from dehydration. This suggests female bonobos can have hostile rivalries with each other and a propensity to carry out infanticide.
The highly sexual nature of bonobo society and the fact that there is little competition over mates means that many males and females are mating with each other, in contrast to the one dominant male chimpanzee that fathers most of the offspring in a group. The strategy of bonobo females mating with many males may be a counterstrategy to infanticide because it confuses paternity. If male bonobos cannot distinguish their own offspring from others, the incentive for infanticide essentially disappears. This is a reproductive strategy that seems specific to bonobos; infanticide is observed in all other great apes except orangutans. Bonobos engage in sexual activity numerous times a day.

It is unknown how the bonobo avoids simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and its effects.

==== Peacefulness ====

Observations in the wild indicate that the males among the related common chimpanzee communities are hostile to males from outside the community. Parties of males &#x27;patrol&#x27; for the neighboring males that might be traveling alone, and attack those single males, often killing them. This does not appear to be the behavior of bonobo males or females, which seem to prefer sexual contact over violent confrontation with outsiders.

While bonobos are more peaceful than chimpanzees, it is not true that they are unaggressive. In the wild, among males, bonobos are more aggressive than chimpanzees, having higher rates of aggressive acts, about three times as much. Although, male chimpanzees are more likely to be aggressive to a lethal degree than male bonobos which are more likely to engage in more frequent, yet less intense squabbling. There is also more female to male aggression with bonobos than there is with chimpanzees. Female bonobos are also more aggressive than female chimpanzees, in general. Both bonobos and chimpanzees exhibit physical aggression more than 100 times as often as humans do.
Although referred to as peaceful, bonobo aggression is not restricted to each other, and humans have also been attacked by bonobos, and suffered serious, albeit non-fatal, injuries. 
Bonobos are far less violent than chimpanzees, though, as lethal aggression is essentially nonexistent among bonobos while being not infrequent among chimpanzees.
It has been hypothesized that bonobos are able to live a more peaceful lifestyle in part because of an abundance of nutritious vegetation in their natural habitat, allowing them to travel and forage in large parties.

Recent studies show that there are significant brain differences between bonobos and chimpanzees. Bonobos have more grey matter volume in the right anterior insula, right dorsal amygdala, hypothalamus, and right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, all of which are regions assumed to be vital for feeling empathy, sensing distress in others and feeling anxiety. They also have a thick connection between the amygdala, an important area that can spark aggression, and the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, which has been shown to help control impulses in humans. This thicker connection may make them better at regulating their emotional impulses and behavior.

Bonobo society is dominated by females, and severing the lifelong alliance between mothers and their male offspring may make them vulnerable to female aggression. De Waal has warned of the danger of romanticizing bonobos: &quot;All animals are competitive by nature and cooperative only under specific circumstances&quot; and that &quot;when first writing about their behaviour, I spoke of &#x27;sex for peace&#x27; precisely because bonobos had plenty of conflicts. There would obviously be no need for peacemaking if they lived in perfect harmony.&quot;

Surbeck and Hohmann showed in 2008 that bonobos sometimes do hunt monkey species. Five incidents were observed in a group of bonobos in Salonga National Park, which seemed to reflect deliberate cooperative hunting. On three occasions, the hunt was successful, and infant monkeys were captured and eaten.

There is one inferred intraspecies killing in the wild, and a confirmed lethal attack in captivity. In both cases, the attackers were female and the victims were male.

=== Diet ===

The bonobo is an omnivorous frugivore; 57% of its diet is fruit, but this is supplemented with leaves, honey, eggs, meat from small vertebrates such as anomalures, flying squirrels and duikers, and invertebrates. The truffle species &quot;Hysterangium bonobo&quot; is eaten by bonobos. In some instances, bonobos have been shown to consume lower-order primates. Some claim bonobos have also been known to practise cannibalism in captivity, a claim disputed by others. However, at least one confirmed report of cannibalism in the wild of a dead infant was described in 2008. A 2016 paper reported two more instances of infant cannibalism, although it was not confirmed if infanticide was involved.

=== Cognitive comparisons to chimpanzees ===
In 2020, the first whole-genome comparison between chimpanzees and bonobos was published and showed genomic aspects that may underlie or have resulted from their divergence and behavioral differences, including selection for genes related to diet and hormones. A 2010 study found that &quot;female bonobos displayed a larger range of tool use behaviours than males, a pattern previously described for chimpanzees but not for other great apes&quot;. This finding was affirmed by the results of another 2010 study which also found that &quot;bonobos were more skilled at solving tasks related to theory of mind or an understanding of social causality, while chimpanzees were more skilled at tasks requiring the use of tools and an understanding of physical causality&quot;. Bonobos have been found to be more risk-averse compared to chimpanzees, preferring immediate rather than delayed rewards when it comes to foraging. Bonobos also have a weaker spatial memory compared to chimpanzees, with adult bonobos performing comparably to juvenile chimpanzees.

=== Similarity to humans ===
Bonobos are capable of passing the mirror-recognition test for self-awareness, as are all great apes. They communicate primarily through vocal means, although the meanings of their vocalizations are not currently known. However, most humans do understand their facial expressions and some of their natural hand gestures, such as their invitation to play. The communication system of wild bonobos includes a characteristic that was earlier only known in humans: bonobos use the same call to mean different things in different situations, and the other bonobos have to take the context into account when determining the meaning.

Two bonobos at the Great Ape Trust, Kanzi and Panbanisha, have been taught how to communicate using a keyboard labeled with lexigrams (geometric symbols) and they can respond to spoken sentences. Kanzi&#x27;s vocabulary consists of more than 500 English words, and he has comprehension of around 3,000 spoken English words.

Kanzi is also known for learning by observing people trying to teach his mother; Kanzi started doing the tasks that his mother was taught just by watching, some of which his mother had failed to learn. Some, such as philosopher and bioethicist Peter Singer, argue that these results qualify them for &quot;rights to survival and life&quot;—rights which humans theoretically accord to all persons (See great ape personhood).

In the 1990s, Kanzi was taught to make and use simple stone tools. This resulted from a study undertaken by researchers Kathy Schick and Nicholas Toth, and later Gary Garufi. The researchers wanted to know if Kanzi possessed the cognitive and biomechanical abilities required to make and use stone tools. Though Kanzi was able to form flakes, he did not create them in the same way as humans, who hold the core in one hand and knap it with the other; Kanzi threw the cobble against a hard surface or against another cobble. This allowed him to produce a larger force to initiate a fracture as opposed to knapping it in his hands.

As in other great apes and humans, third party affiliation toward the victim—the affinitive contact made toward the recipient of an aggression by a group member other than the aggressor—is present in bonobos. A 2013 study found that both the affiliation spontaneously offered by a bystander to the victim and the affiliation requested by the victim (solicited affiliation) can reduce the probability of further aggression by group members on the victim (this fact supporting the &quot;Victim-Protection Hypothesis&quot;). Yet, only spontaneous affiliation reduced victim anxiety—measured via self-scratching rates—thus suggesting not only that non-solicited affiliation has a consolatory function but also that the spontaneous gesture—more than the protection itself—works in calming the distressed subject. The authors hypothesize that the victim may perceive the motivational autonomy of the bystander, who does not require an invitation to provide post-conflict affinitive contact. Moreover, spontaneous—but not solicited—third party affiliation was affected by the bond between consoler and victim (this supporting the &quot;Consolation Hypothesis&quot;). Importantly, spontaneous affiliation followed the empathic gradient described for humans, being mostly offered to kin, then friends, then acquaintances (these categories having been determined using affiliation rates between individuals). Hence, consolation in the bonobo may be an empathy-based phenomenon.

Instances in which bonobos have expressed joy have been reported. One study analyzed and recorded sounds made by human infants and bonobos when they were tickled. Although the bonobos&#x27; laugh was at a higher frequency, the laugh was found to follow a spectrographic pattern similar to that of human babies.

== Distribution and habitat ==

Bonobos are found only south of the Congo River and north of the Kasai River (a tributary of the Congo), in the humid forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Ernst Schwarz&#x27;s 1927 paper &quot;Le Chimpanzé de la Rive Gauche du Congo&quot;, announcing his discovery, has been read as an association between the Parisian Left Bank and the left bank of the Congo River; the bohemian culture in Paris, and an unconventional ape in the Congo.
The ranges of bonobos and chimpanzees are separated by the Congo River, with bonobos living to its south and chimpanzees to the north.

== Ecological role ==

In the Congo tropical rainforest, the very great majority of plants need animals to reproduce and disperse their seeds. Bonobos are the second largest frugivorous animals in this region, after elephants. It is estimated that during its life, each bonobo will ingest and disperse nine tons of seeds, from more than 91 species of lianas, grass, trees and shrubs. These seeds travel for about 24 hours in the bonobo digestive tract, which can transfer them over several kilometers (mean 1.3 km; max: 4.5 km), far from their parents, where they will be deposited intact in their feces. These dispersed seeds remain viable, germinating better and more quickly than unpassed seeds. For those seeds, diplochory with dung-beetles (Scarabaeidae) improves post-dispersal survival.

Certain plants such as &quot;Dialium&quot; may even be dependent on bonobos to activate the germination of their seeds, characterized by tegumentary dormancy. The first parameters of the effectiveness of seed dispersal by bonobos are present. Behavior of the bonobo could affect the population structure of plants whose seeds they disperse. The majority of these zoochorous plants cannot recruit without dispersal and the homogeneous spatial structure of the trees suggests a direct link with their dispersal agent. Few species could replace bonobos in terms of seed dispersal services, just as bonobos could not replace elephants. There is little functional redundancy between frugivorous mammals of the Congo, which face severe human hunting pressures and local extinction. The defaunation of the forests, leading to the empty forest syndrome, is critical in conservation biology. The disappearance of the bonobos, which disperse seeds of 40% of the tree species in these forests, or 11.6 million individual seeds during the life of each bonobo, would have consequences for the conservation of the Congo rainforest.

== Conservation status ==
The IUCN Red List classifies bonobos as an endangered species, with conservative population estimates ranging from 29,500 to 50,000 individuals. Major threats to bonobo populations include habitat loss and hunting for bushmeat, the latter activity having increased dramatically during the first and second Congo Wars in the Democratic Republic of Congo, due to the presence of heavily armed militias (even in remote, &quot;protected&quot; areas such as Salonga National Park). This is part of a more general trend of ape extinction.

As the bonobos&#x27; habitat is shared with many people, the ultimate success of conservation efforts still relies on local and community involvement. The issue of parks versus people is salient in the Cuvette Centrale, within the bonobos&#x27; range. There is strong local, and broad-based Congolese, resistance to establishing national parks, as indigenous communities have previously been driven from their forest homes by the forming of parks. In Salonga National Park (the only national park in bonobo habitat), there is no local involvement, and surveys undertaken since 2000 indicate the bonobo, the African forest elephant, the okapi, and other rare species have been devastated by poachers and the thriving bushmeat trade. In contrast, areas do exist where the bonobo and ecological biodiversity still thrive without any established park borders, because of the indigenous beliefs/taboos against killing bonobos and other animals.

During the wars in the 1990s, researchers and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were driven out of the bonobo habitat. In 2002, the Bonobo Conservation Initiative initiated the Bonobo Peace Forest Project (supported by the Global Conservation Fund of Conservation International), in cooperation with national institutions, local NGOs, and local communities; the Peace Forest Project works with local communities to establish a linked constellation of community-based reserves managed by local and indigenous people. This model, implemented mainly through DRC organizations and local communities, has helped bring about agreements to protect over of the bonobo habitat. According to Amy Parish, the Bonobo Peace Forest &quot;is going to be a model for conservation in the 21st century&quot;.

The port town of Basankusu is situated on the Lulonga River, at the confluence of the Lopori and Maringa Rivers, in the north of the country, making it well placed to receive and transport local goods to the cities of Mbandaka and Kinshasa. With Basankusu being the last port of substance before the wilderness of the Lopori Basin and the Lomako River—the bonobo heartland—conservation efforts for the bonobo use the town as a base.

In 1995, concern over declining numbers of bonobos in the wild led the Zoological Society of Milwaukee (ZSM), in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with contributions from bonobo scientists around the world, to publish the Action Plan for &quot;Pan paniscus&quot;: A Report on Free Ranging Populations and Proposals for their Preservation. The Action Plan compiles population data on bonobos from 20 years of research conducted at various sites throughout the bonobo&#x27;s range. The plan identifies priority actions for bonobo conservation and serves as a reference for developing conservation programs for researchers, government officials, and donor agencies.

Acting on Action Plan recommendations, the ZSM developed the Bonobo and Congo Biodiversity Initiative. This program includes habitat and rain-forest preservation, training for Congolese nationals and conservation institutions, wildlife population assessment and monitoring, and education. The ZSM has conducted regional surveys within the range of the bonobo in conjunction with training Congolese researchers in survey methodology and biodiversity monitoring. The ZSM&#x27;s initial goal was to survey Salonga National Park to determine the conservation status of the bonobo within the park and to provide financial and technical assistance to strengthen park protection. As the project has developed, the ZSM has become more involved in helping the Congolese living in bonobo habitat. They have built schools, hired teachers, provided some medicines, and started an agriculture project to help the Congolese learn to grow crops and depend less on hunting wild animals.

With grants from the United Nations, USAID, the U.S. Embassy, the World Wildlife Fund, and many other groups and individuals, the ZSM also has been working to:
* Survey the bonobo population and its habitat to find ways to help protect these apes
* Develop antipoaching measures to help save apes, forest elephants, and other endangered animals in Congo&#x27;s Salonga National Park, a UN World Heritage Site
* Provide training, literacy education, agricultural techniques, schools, equipment, and jobs for Congolese living near bonobo habitats so that they will have a vested interest in protecting the great apes – the ZSM started an agriculture project to help the Congolese learn to grow crops and depend less on hunting wild animals.
* Model small-scale conservation methods that can be used throughout Congo

Starting in 2003, the U.S. government allocated $54 million to the Congo Basin Forest Partnership. This significant investment has triggered the involvement of international NGOs to establish bases in the region and work to develop bonobo conservation programs. This initiative should improve the likelihood of bonobo survival, but its success still may depend upon building greater involvement and capability in local and indigenous communities.

The bonobo population is believed to have declined sharply in the last 30 years, though surveys have been hard to carry out in war-ravaged central Congo. Estimates range from 60,000 to fewer than 50,000 living, according to the World Wildlife Fund.

In addition, concerned parties have addressed the crisis on several science and ecological websites. Organizations such as the World Wide Fund for Nature, the African Wildlife Foundation, and others, are trying to focus attention on the extreme risk to the species. Some have suggested that a reserve be established in a more stable part of Africa, or on an island in a place such as Indonesia. Awareness is ever increasing, and even nonscientific or ecological sites have created various groups to collect donations to help with the conservation of this species.

==Bonobos in human culture==

<text>Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution is a 1999 book on environmental economics co-authored by Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins and Hunter Lovins. It has been translated into a dozen languages and was the subject of a Harvard Business Review summary.

==Content==

In &quot;Natural Capitalism&quot; the authors describe the global economy as being dependent on natural resources and ecosystem services that nature provides. Natural Capitalism is a critique of traditional &quot;Industrial Capitalism&quot;, saying that the traditional system of capitalism &quot;does not fully conform to its own accounting principles. It liquidates its capital and calls it income. It neglects to assign any value to the largest stocks of capital it employs – the natural resources and living systems, as well as the social and cultural systems that are the basis of human capital.&quot;

Natural capitalism recognizes the critical interdependency between the production and use of human-made capital and the maintenance and supply of natural capital. The authors argue that only through recognizing this essential relationship with the Earth&#x27;s valuable resources can businesses, and the people they support, continue to exist.

Their fundamental questions concern the theoretical properties of an economy that, among other tenets, organizes around a more realistic ideation of the principles of business and industry, and envisioning a world in which this is a reality is a key concern of the argument.

The authors of &quot;Natural Capitalism&quot; claim that these choices are possible and &quot;such an economy would offer a stunning new set of opportunities for all of society, amounting to no less than &quot;the next industrial revolution&quot;.&quot;

According to the authors, the &quot;next industrial revolution&quot; depends on the espousal of four central strategies: &quot;the conservation of resources through more effective manufacturing processes, the reuse of materials as found in natural systems, a change in values from quantity to quality, and investing in natural capital, or restoring and sustaining natural resources&quot;.

While traditional industrial capitalism primarily recognizes the value of money and goods as capital, &quot;Natural Capitalism&quot; extends recognition to natural capital and human capital. Problems such as pollution and social injustice may then be seen as failures to properly account for capital, rather than as inherent failures of capitalism itself.

The fundamental assumptions of &quot;Natural Capitalism&quot; are as follows:

#The limiting factor to future economic development is the availability and functionality of natural capital, in particular, life-supporting services that have no substitutes and currently have no market value.
#Misconceived or badly designed business systems, population growth, and wasteful patterns of consumption are the primary causes of the loss of natural capital, and all three must be addressed to achieve a sustainable economy.
#Future economic progress can best take place in democratic, market-based systems of production and distribution in which all forms of capital are fully valued, including human, manufactured, financial, and natural capital.
#One of the keys to the most beneficial employment of people, money, and the environment is radical increases in resource productivity.
#Human welfare is best served by improving the quality and flow of desired services delivered, rather than by merely increasing the total dollar flow.
#Economic and environmental sustainability depends on redressing global inequities of income and material well-being.

==Meaning of book&#x27;s title==

In a 2009 interview, Paul Hawken described his motivation behind the title &quot;Natural Capitalism&quot;. He stated that it was intended to be a pun on &quot;natural capital&quot;, a term originally coined by E. F. Schumacher in 1973. Hawken endorsed the underlying concept of &quot;natural capital&quot;, and its implications for society, so added an &quot;-ism&quot; at the end of that word as a double entendre.

Despite this intention from Hawken, many readers interpreted this wordplay in the opposite way. There was dissent from readers who misunderstood the title, believing that &quot;Capitalism&quot; was the operative word, and that the authors were therefore justifying or defending the concept of capitalism. Hawken later expressed regret at this confusion, and stated that while he endorses the spirit of commerce and entrepreneurship, he does not endorse the &quot;pathological&quot; qualities inherent in pure capitalism.
