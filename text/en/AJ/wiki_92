<text>Lelystad () is a Dutch municipality and the capital city of the province of Flevoland in the central Netherlands. The city, built on reclaimed land, was founded in 1967 and was named after Cornelis Lely, who engineered the Afsluitdijk that made the reclamation possible. Lelystad is situated approximately three metres (10 feet) below sea level.

==History==
Lelystad is built on the seabed of the former Zuiderzee. About 6,500 years ago, this wetland was above high tide level and inhabited; the Netherlands have steadily subsided since. Near Lelystad at Swifterbant, the oldest human skeletons in Western Europe were discovered. Due to rising water levels and storms, the peatlands were washed away, and the Lacus Flevo (in Roman times) grew to be the Almere (Middle Ages) and became the Zuiderzee. The Zuiderzee (Southern Sea) was the main transport route from Amsterdam to the North Sea and the Hanseatic League cities. Due to the many shipwrecks in Flevoland, Lelystad now houses the National Centre for Maritime History, with a museum and the shipyard that has built the &quot;Batavia&quot; replica.

After the Second World War the Zuiderzee Works continued, constructing the polder of Eastern Flevoland. In 1950 work commenced on several construction islands in the middle of the IJsselmeer. &quot;Lelystad-Haven&quot; was the largest island, and its wooden barracks housed a community of dyke-builders. In 1955 they reached the mainland, which made it possible to drive to Lelystad by car. One of the three pumping stations, which drained the polder in June 1957, was the diesel-powered &quot;Wortman&quot; in Lelystad-Haven. Until 1967 the only inhabitants of Lelystad were technical engineers and laborers and superintendents, living on the former construction island.

==Demographics==

=== Ethnic composition ===
Source:
*65% of the population was of Dutch background (two parents born in the Netherlands)
*23% was of non-Western migration background (one or two parents born in a non-Western country)
*12% was of Western migration background (one or two parents born in a Western country)

Lelystad has a large population of Surinamese origin (5,225); most residents of a non-Western background live in the east of the city. Lelystad also has significant Moroccan (2,615) and Turkish (2,278) communities, most of whom reside in the northeastern part of the city. There were 2,059 residents with an Antillean background.

==Climate==
==Landscape==

Lelystad is the largest municipality in the Netherlands in area, but a large part of that area is water: Markermeer and IJsselmeer. Another major area is the internationally famous nature park of Oostvaardersplassen, which arose naturally when the polder of South Flevoland was drained. Lelystad is also surrounded by a square of woodlands and parks and flat farmland. The importance of the landscape and sky is emphasized by several pieces of land art: engineers&#x27; work and works such as the &quot;Observatorium&quot; by Robert Morris (see below).

The artificial islands of Marker Wadden lie immediately to the northwest of Lelystad. Construction started in 2016, and the first islands have already become important wildlife sites, with many species of birds coming to the islands during the breeding season.

==Tourism==
Lelystad has several tourist attractions, including:
* The replica of the 17th-century ship &quot;Batavia&quot; at the Batavia Shipyard
* Batavia Stad Fashion Outlet
* Hanzestad Compagnie, a fleet of historical sailing ships
* Lelystad Nature Park
* National Aviation Theme Park Aviodrome
* Modern architecture, for example the Zilverparkkade and Agora Theatre

Lelystad hosts many one-day events like the Lelystad Airshow, the Water Festival, the National Old Timer Day, Lelystad Speedway, Architecture day and several sports events. On the Midland Circuit many motor, kart and stock car racing events and several autoclub meetings are held. On the coast there are several marinas.

==Transport==

Lelystad can be reached by air, water, and land.

===Air===
Lelystad Airport is the biggest general aviation airport in the Netherlands. It is owned wholly by Schiphol Group. Lelystad Airport has undergone major expansion, including the construction of a passenger terminal for commercial flights, as well as an extension of the runway. The original plan for this airport was to become the main gateway for passengers into the country, to alleviate some of the pressure from Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam. In turn, Schiphol would be able to focus on its role as international hub for lay-overs. Although the expansion of Lelystad Airport has been finished, the airport has not yet opened for passengers due to various political reasons. As of 2022, the government has decided to delay the opening of the terminals with at least two years, and even then the opening will not be guaranteed.

===Water===
Lelystad has a small inland port, several marinas, and a canal system which also functions to aid in managing the water levels in the rest of the polder. The canal system connects to the Markermeer with a lock to the southwest of Lelystad, and connects the city and its industrial areas to all other towns and their respective industrial areas in the polder.

===Rail===
the Weesp–Lelystad railway (&quot;Flevolijn&quot;) extends south from Lelystad Centrum railway station and connects the city with Almere, and to the Randstad region beyond. The Lelystad–Zwolle railway (&quot;Hanzelijn&quot;) extends north from Lelystad and connects it with Dronten, Kampen and Zwolle.

===Motorway===
The A6 motorway runs along Lelystad on the eastern side of the city. There are three on-ramps connecting this motorway to Lelystad, allowing traffic to travel northbound to Emmeloord and the province of Friesland, or southbound to Almere and the Randstad region.

===Provincial roads===
The N302 provincial road connects Lelystad to the south-east with Harderwijk and the province of Gelderland beyond. The N307 connects Lelystad across the Houtribdijk to Enkhuizen and the province of North Holland beyond, and to Dronten and beyond that to Kampen in the province of Overijssel. The N309 connects Lelystad to Dronten and beyond that to Elburg in the province of Gelderland.

==Shield and flag==
The honeycomb grid in the arms of Lelystad represents the dykes, built with six-edged concrete or basalt blocks. The colour gold indicates the high costs of the project of making the polder. The centre shield is the arms of engineer Cornelis Lely. The sealions reflect the history of the land.

In the flag, the fleur-de-lis (lily) again takes a central point, referring to the name Lely. The yellow background reflects the precious land, and the blue lines the dykes and waterways. The flag of the province is similarly adorned with the fleur-de-lis to commemorate Lely.

<text>The IJsselmeer (; , ), also known as Lake IJssel in English, is a closed-off freshwater lake in the central Netherlands bordering the provinces of Flevoland, North Holland and Friesland. It covers an area of with an average depth of . The river IJssel, after which the lake was named, flows into the IJsselmeer.

The first two letters of the name are capitalized because [[IJ (digraph)|IJ]] is a digraph sometimes considered a ligature in Dutch.

== History ==

Two thousand years ago Pomponius Mela, a Roman geographer, mentioned a complex of lakes at the current location of the IJsselmeer. He called it &quot;Lacus Flevo&quot;. Over the centuries, the lake banks crumbled away due to flooding and wave action, and the lake, now called the Almere, grew considerably. During the 12th and 13th centuries, storm surges and rising sea levels flooded large areas of land between the lake and the North Sea, turning the lake into a bay of the North Sea, called the Zuiderzee. The Zuiderzee continued to be a threat to the Dutch, especially when northwesterly storms funnel North Sea waters towards the English Channel, creating very high tides along the Dutch coast. During the 17th century, Zuiderzee dykes collapsed several times, and plans were drawn up to eliminate the threat by draining the bay. Later drainage plans focused on creating fertile farmland, but they never progressed beyond the planning stage. It was only after the flood of 1916 that the legislature approved the Zuiderzee Works, a major hydraulic engineering project that involved building dykes, draining parts of the Zuiderzee, and constructing the Afsluitdijk to keep tides and high water out.

In 1932 the Zuiderzee was closed off by the Afsluitdijk, a dyke connecting Friesland and North Holland on either side of the Zuiderzee. The Zuiderzee was no longer a sea inlet and was renamed IJsselmeer (&quot;Lake IJssel&quot;) after the IJssel river that flows into it, which is also the namesake of the province of Overijssel. The continuing flow of fresh river water soon flushed out the salt water. Part of the IJsselmeer was later closed off to form the Markermeer. 

From 1929 till 1967, over half the IJsselmeer was drained, creating of polders: Wieringermeerpolder, Noordoostpolder, East and South Flevoland.

In 1975, a dyke was built between Enkhuizen and Lelystad as the northern boundary of the Markerwaard, a planned but never realized polder in the IJsselmeer. This dyke, the &quot;Houtribdijk&quot; or &quot;Markerwaarddijk&quot;, split the IJsselmeer into two parts. The former southern part of the IJsselmeer is now the hydrologically separate Markermeer. The proposed polderisation of the Markerwaard was abandoned after many of the Dutch population did not want the loss of the traditional seaside (now lakeside) environment and vistas. 

In 1986 three polders in the IJsselmeer constituted the new province of Flevoland, the twelfth province of the Netherlands.

The water of the IJsselmeer is now almost completely fresh, the saline having long since been purged. This altered environment has had an impact on the fish and plant ecosystems. The change has been beneficial for Dutch boats, many of which are steel, as the freshwater significantly reduces rusting of the hulls, and there is far less build-up of marine growth (such as algae and barnacles below the barges&#x27; waterlines). This has the knock-on benefit that barges and yachts in the IJsselmeer need far less antifouling, a coating which is inevitably somewhat toxic to wildlife.

== Current use ==
Due to considerable amounts of water from the Rhine flowing through its distributary IJssel into the IJsselmeer, the closed-off bay functions as a large freshwater reservoir, serving as a source for agriculture and drinking water. Outlet sluices in the Afsluitdijk regulate the water level of the IJsselmeer.

The IJsselmeer is used for transport and fishing. It also offers a number of opportunities for recreational activity, both on the water and on its shores. Due to the shallowness of the IJsselmeer, the Markermeer, and the bordering lakes, its cities and fishing villages remained mostly unspoilt and have many historic buildings.

The IJsselmeer is home to the offshore segments of Windpark Noordoostpolder. In the future, Windpark Fryslan will also be built in this bay.

<text>The term Latins has been used throughout history to refer to various peoples, ethnicities and religious groups using Latin or the Latin-derived Romance languages, as part of the legacy of the Roman Empire. In the Ancient World, it referred to the people of ancient Latium, including the Romans. Following the spread of Christianity, it came to indicate the Catholics of the Latin Church, especially those following Western liturgical rites. Currently, it defines the peoples using the Romance languages in Europe and the Americas.

==Antiquity==


The Latins were an ancient Italic people of the Latium region in central Italy (&quot;Latium Vetus&quot;, &quot;Old Latium&quot;), in the 1st millennium BC. Although they lived in independent city-states, they spoke a common language (Latin), held common religious beliefs, and extended common rights of residence and trade to one another. Collectively, these Latin states were known as the Latin League.

A rupture between Rome, one of the Latin states, and the rest of the Latin League emerged as a result of the former&#x27;s territorial ambitions. The Latin League fought against Rome in the Latin War (340-338 BC), which ended in a Roman victory. Consequently, some of the Latin states were incorporated within the Roman state, and their inhabitants were given full Roman citizenship. Others became Roman allies and enjoyed certain privileges.

The Roman Empire would go on to dominate the Mediterranean region for the next several centuries, spreading the Latin language and Roman culture. The Latin-speaking Western Roman Empire ended in AD 476, while the Greek-speaking eastern half survived on until 1453.

==Middle Ages==
In the Eastern Roman Empire, and the broader Greek-Orthodox world, &quot;Latins&quot; was a synonym for all people who followed the Roman Catholicism of Western Christianity, regardless of ethnicity. The term was related to the predominance of the Latin Church, which is the largest autonomous particular church within the broader Catholic Church, and took its name from its origins in the Latin-speaking world which had Rome as its center.

&quot;Latin&quot; was generally a negative characterization, especially after the 1054 schism. The term is still used by the Orthodox church communities, but only in a theological context. Nonetheless, it did not share this negative connotation in the West, where many self-identified with the term, such as Petrarch, when he states &quot;Sumus enim non greci, non barbari, sed itali et latini.&quot; (&quot;We are not Greeks or barbarians; we are Italians and Latins.&quot;).

== Latin peoples and regions ==


The various Romance-speaking groups of the present day, usually those of Latin Europe and Latin America, have sometimes been collectively referred to as &quot;Latin peoples&quot;. Other synonymous terms are &quot;Romance peoples&quot; or &quot;Romanic peoples&quot;. Likewise, the Romance languages themselves are sometimes referred to as the Latin or Neo-Latin languages. The designation also specifically survived in the names of two Romance-speaking groups: the Ladin people of northern Italy and the Ladino people of Central America. 

The term &quot;Latin Europe&quot; is sometimes used in reference to European nations and regions inhabited by Romance-speaking people.

&quot;Latin America&quot; is the region of the Americas that was colonized by Latin Europeans, and came to be called so in the 19th century. The term is usually used to refer to Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries, namely Hispanic America and Brazil. Latin Americans are called &quot;latinoamericanos and&quot; &quot;latino-americanos&quot; in Spanish and Portuguese, respectively; the shortening of this term resulted in the name for Latinos, who are themselves sometimes just called &quot;Latin&quot;. 

Many of the present-day independent states of Africa have main official languages that are Romance, as a result of colonization by Romance-speaking European nations in the 19th century. Barthélémy Boganda, a politician of the Central African Republic, proposed a &quot;United States of Latin Africa&quot; in 1957 that would serve as a federation of the Romance-speaking countries in the region of Central Africa, which never came into fruition. African-American author Richard Wright, who criticized the proposal, said that &quot;Latin Africa&quot; correlated with &quot;Catholic Africa&quot; and would create an unnecessary religious division against the English-speaking &quot;Protestant Africa&quot;.

<text>Jenin ( ; , ) is a city in the State of Palestine in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The city serves as the administrative center of the Jenin Governorate of Palestine and is a major center for the surrounding towns. Jenin came under Israeli occupation in 1967 and was put under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority as Area A of the West Bank, a Palestinian enclave, in 1995.

In 2017, Jenin had a population of approximately 50,000 people, whilst the Jenin refugee camp had a population of about 10,000, housing families of Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes during the 1948 Palestine War. The camp has since become a stronghold of Palestinian militants against British colonialism and Israeli occupation, being the location of several incidents relating to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

==Etymology==
Jenin has been identified as the place &quot;Gina&quot; or &quot;Ginah&quot; mentioned in the Amarna letters from the 14th century BCE, as a town in Canaan. Jenin is commonly identified with the later biblical city of Ein-Ganim, from , meaning &quot;the spring of gardens&quot; or &quot;the spring of Ganim&quot;, probably referring to the many springs located nearby. The present-day Arabic name is believed to preserve the city&#x27;s ancient name.

==History==
===Ancient period===
Jenin is identified with a number of important towns mentioned in ancient sources. Throughout history, it was referred to as &quot;Ein Ganim&quot;, &quot;Beth Hagan&quot;, &quot;Ginah&quot;, and &quot;Ginae&quot;, along other names.

Tell Jenin, believed to constitute the original settlement core of the city, is located at the center of what is today Jenin&#x27;s business district. The tell is also known as &quot;Tell el-Nawar&quot;, a term derived from the Arabic word for &quot;gypsies,&quot; due to former nomadic encampments in this site. The earliest settlement at the tell dates to the late Neolithic and the early Chalcolithic. In the early 20th century, the tell was occupied by a modern cemetery and a threshing floor.

==== Bronze Age ====
Jenin has been identified as the place &quot;Gina&quot; or &quot;Ginah&quot; mentioned in the Amarna letters from the 14th century BCE. At the time, it was a vassal state of the New Kingdom of Egypt. The people of Gina managed to kill the warlord Labaya during the reign of Pharaoh Akhenaten.

==== Iron Age ====
Jenin is identical to &quot;Ein-Ganim&quot;, which the Hebrew Bible describes as a Levite city belonging to the Israelite Tribe of Issachar. It has also been associated with &quot;Beth-Haggan&quot;, mentioned in 2 Kings in connection with Ahaziah&#x27;s flight from Jehu, before he is wounded at Ibleam and later dies in Megiddo. The Book of Judith renders its name as &quot;Gini&quot;.

===Roman and Byzantine periods===
Josephus, a Roman-Jewish historian of the 1st-century CE, mentions &quot;Ginae&quot; as being in the great plain, on the northern border of Samaria. During the Roman period, &quot;Ginae&quot; was settled exclusively by Samaritans. The people of Galilee were disposed to pass through their city during the annual pilgrimages to Jerusalem. In 51 CE, a Galilean Jew was killed in Ginae by hostile Samaritans while en route to Jerusalem to celebrate Sukkot. With Roman procurator Cumanus failing to respond, Jewish Zealots led by Elazar the Son of Deinaeus (Ben Dinai) sought vengeance, and several Samaritan villages in Aqrabatene were destroyed.

Biblical commentator F. W. Farrar raised the possibility that this Samaritan village, &quot;the first village at which [a traveler taking the road from Galilee to Judea over Mount Tabor] would arrive&quot;, was the one which rejected the disciples of Jesus in Luke&#x27;s Gospel at the point where Jesus and his followers begin his journey towards Jerusalem.

Ceramics dating from the Byzantine era have been found here. There is no mention of Jenin in the reports of the Muslim conquest of the Levant from the Byzantines, which, according to the historian Moshe Sharon, &quot;is not surprising, since it was a small place of minor importance&quot;.

===Crusader, Ayyubid and Mamluk periods===
Jenin came under Crusader rule in 1103. The Crusaders called it &quot;Le Grand Guerin&quot; (Latin: &quot;Garinum&quot; or &quot;Gallina Major&quot;), to distinguish it from the town of Zir&#x27;in, which they called &quot;Petit Grin&quot;. Under the Crusaders it was a small seigniory, forming part of the Principality of Galilee or the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

Shortly before the Battle of Hattin in 1187, Jenin was captured by the Ayyubid sultan Saladin, who destroyed the nearby fort, Castellum Beleismum. In the 1220s, the geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi described Jenin as &quot;a small and beautiful town, lying between Nabulus and Beisan, in the Jordan Province. There is much water, and many springs are found here, and often have I visited it.&quot; In 1229, a peace was concluded between Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and Sultan al-Kamil, during the Sixth Crusade, whereby the city was given to the Crusaders, but Sultan as-Salih Ayyub was able to control it permanently in 1244 after the Battle of La Forbie.

In 1255, it was agreed between the Ayyubid sultan in Syria, an-Nasir Yusuf, and the first Mamluk sultan in Egypt, Izz al-Din Aybak, to give the latter all of the lands lying west of the Jordan River, and thus Jenin entered into the possession of the Mamluks. It was one of eleven subdistricts of Mamlakat Safad (Province of Safed). In the late 13th century, Mamluk emirs (commanders) stationed at Jenin were ordered by Sultan Qalawun () &quot;to ride every day with their troops before the fortress of &#x27;Akka, so as to protect the coast and the merchants.&quot; As one of the stations of the Mamluk &quot;barid&quot; (postal route) between the Mamluk capital Cairo and Damascus, it was one of the towns where fires were lit to warn of a Mongol attack. The geographer al-Dimashqi mentioned Jenin around 1300. From the time of Qalawun&#x27;s son, Sultan an-Nasir Muhammad (), it was a station on the route where ice was transported to Cairo for the sultans&#x27; drink houses. The Mamluk historian al-Qalqashandi (d. 1418) described Jenin as &quot;an ancient spacious town which is riding on a shoulder of a nice valley in which there is a river of flowing water&quot; north of Qaqun &quot;on the top end of Marj Bani Amer [Jezreel Valley]&quot;. He also noted that it contained the mausoleum of Dihyah al-Kalbi, a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.

===Ottoman era===


The Ottomans conquered Mamluk Syria in 1516. Jenin became the administrative center of a &quot;nahiya&quot; (subdistrict) of the Lajjun Sanjak (Lajjun District). The sanjak was officially called the Iqta (Fief) of Turabay until 1559 when it became officially known as the Lajjun Sanjak. The Turabay dynasty was the ruling house of the Bedouin Banu Haritha tribe, whose members held the governorship of Lajjun from the start of Ottoman rule through 1677. 

The tax registers from 1548–1549 report that Jenin had a population of eight households, all Muslim. They paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, goats and beehives, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 2,000 akçe. All of the revenue went to a &quot;waqf&quot; (religious endowment) in the name of the Mamluk sultan Qansuh al-Ghuri (). Turabay rule was occasionally interrupted, including in 1564, when a certain Kemal Bey was appointed &quot;sanjak-bey&quot; (district governor) by the Ottomans. On 15 October 1564 Kemal Bey requested from the &quot;beylerbey&quot; (provincial governor) of Damascus that the stone caravanserai of Jenin be repaired, garrisoned and serve as the chief headquarters of the Lajjun &quot;sanjak-bey&quot; in order for Lajjun to prosper and for the road connecting Damascus to Jerusalem and Egypt to become secure. The official response was that the caravanserai be turned into a fortress; the fortress became ruined at some later point and 19th-century residents of Jenin used to claim that certain large rocks strewn in the village were the remnants of the 16th-century fortress.

The Turabays, who remained nomads in the plain between Mount Carmel and Caesarea, made Jenin the administrative headquarters of Lajjun and used the town&#x27;s Izz al-Din Cemetery to bury their dead. A large, domed mausoleum was built for the grave of one of the chiefs and &quot;sanjak-beys&quot; of the family, Turabay ibn Ali (d. 1601). Known as Qubbat al-Amir Turabay (Dome of the Emir Turabay), it was described in a 1941 report as a ruined structure, and Sharon, writing in 2017, notes that it &quot;does not exist anymore&quot;. No other graves of the Turabays in Jenin had survived into the 20th century. During the conflict between Fakhr al-Din of the Ma&#x27;n dynasty, who governed the sanjaks of Sidon-Beirut and Safed, and the Turabays, in 1623, Fakhr al-Din captured Jenin and stationed his men there. In 1624 the most prominent Turabay chief and &quot;sanjak-bey&quot; of Lajjun, Ahmad ibn Turabay, drove out the Ma&#x27;nid troops from Jenin and established his personal residence in the town.

In the mid-18th century, Jenin was designated the administrative capital of the combined districts of Lajjun and Ajlun. There are indications that the area comprising Jenin and Nablus remained functionally autonomous under Ottoman rule and that the empire struggled to collect taxes there. During the Napoleonic Campaign in Egypt which extended into Syria and Palestine in 1799, a local official from Jenin wrote a poem enumerating and calling upon local Arab leaders to resist Bonaparte, without mentioning the Sultan or the need to protect the Ottoman Empire.

In the late 19th century, some members of the Jarrar family, who formed part of the &quot;mallakin&quot; (elite land-owning families) in Jenin, cooperated with merchants in Haifa to set up an export enterprise there. During the Ottoman era, Jenin was plagued by local warfare between members of the same clan. The French explorer Guérin visited in 1870. In 1882, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described Jenin as &quot;The capital of the district, the seat of a Caimacam, a town of about 3,000 inhabitants, with a small bazaar. The houses are well built of stone. There are two families of Roman Catholics; the remainder are Moslems. A spring rises east of the town and is conducted to a large masonry reservoir, near the west side, of good squared stonework, with a long stone trough. This reservoir was built by &#x27;And el Hady, Mudir of Acre, in the first half of the century [..], north of the town is the little mosque of &#x27;Ezz ed Din, with a good- sized dome and a minaret.&quot;

===British Mandate period===
According to a census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, Jenin had a population of 2,637 (2,307 Muslims, 212 Hindus, 108 Christians, seven Jews, and three Sikhs). A following census in 1931 showed a slight increase to 2,706 (2,610 Muslims, 103 Christians, two Jews, and one Druze) with another 68 in nearby suburbs (all Muslims). From 1936, Jenin became a center of rebellion against the British Mandatory authorities. By the summer of 1938, residents of the city embarked on &quot;an intensified campaign of murder, intimidation and sabotage&quot; that caused the British administration &quot;grave concern&quot;, according to a British report to the League of Nations; the population had further increased to 3,100. The city played an important role in the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine, prompted by the death of Izz ad-Din al-Qassam in a fire-fight with British colonial police at the nearby town of Ya&#x27;bad months prior to the start of the revolt. On 25 August 1938, the day after the British Assistant District Commissioner was assassinated in his Jenin office, a large British force with explosives entered the town. Despite having captured and killed the assassin, British forces ordered the inhabitants to leave, and blew up one quarter of the town as a form of punishment.

Jenin was used by Fawzi al-Qawuqji&#x27;s Arab Liberation Army as a base.

The village statistics of 1945 list the population as 3,990 (3,840 Muslims and 150 Christians).

===1948 War===

In the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the city was defended by the Iraqi Army, then captured briefly by the forces from Israel&#x27;s Carmeli Brigade during the &quot;Ten Days&#x27; fighting&quot; following the cancellation of the first cease-fire. Prior to the battle, the city&#x27;s residents fled temporarily. The offensive was actually a feint designed to draw Arab forces away from the critical Battle for Jerusalem, and gains in that sector were quickly abandoned when Arab reinforcements arrived.

===Jordanian control===
In the wake of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and after the 1949 Armistice Agreements, Jenin came under Jordanian rule. It was annexed by Jordan in 1950.

The Jenin refugee camp was founded in 1953 by Jordan to house displaced Palestinians who fled or were expelled during the 1948 War. In 2014 the camp had a population of 16,000. For 19 years, the city was under Jordanian control. A war cemetery for Iraqi soldiers and local combatants is located on the outskirts of Jenin.

The Jordanian census of 1961 found 14,402 inhabitants in Jenin.

=== Israeli occupation 1967 to 2020 ===

Jenin has been under Israeli occupation since the Six-Day War, in 1967.

On 14 May 1989, during the early months of the First Intifada. Mohammad Jibrin, aged 45, died in Ramallah Hospital after being beaten by Israeli soldiers in Jenin. Three months later, in response to a question from a member of Knesset Defence Minister Yitzhak Rabin wrote that there was no investigation by the Military Police Investigator.

According to Joel Beinin, Jenin was classified as under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority as Area A of the West Bank, a Palestinian enclave, in 1995. In 1996, Israel handed over control of the city to the Palestinian National Authority in keeping with the Oslo Accords.

According to the BBC, the city is &quot;Known among Palestinians&quot; as &quot;the Martyrs&#x27; capital&quot;, but the reason they gave was Israeli statistics about suicide bombings, the BBC did not identify any non-Israeli source for the name. During the Second Palestinian uprising (also known as the Al-Aqsa Intifada) the camp&#x27;s militants, some 200 armed men, included members of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, Tanzim, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and Hamas. By Israel&#x27;s count, at least 28 suicide bombers were dispatched from the Jenin camp from 2000–2003 during the Second Intifada. Israeli army weekly &quot;Bamahane&quot; attributes at least 31 militant attacks, totaling 124 victims, to Jenin during the same period, more than any other city in the West Bank.

During the al-Aqsa Intifada, Israel launched Operation Defensive Shield with the stated aim of dismantling militant infrastructure so as to curb suicide bombings and other militant activities. The army encircled and entered six major Palestinian population centers in the West Bank, among them Jenin. During the Battle of Jenin (2002) in April 2002, 23 Israeli soldiers and 52 Palestinians, including civilians, were killed. Human Rights Watch reported that the refugee camp, which was the major battleground, suffered extensive damage. Witnesses stated unarmed people were shot and denied medical treatment, and as a result died. Human Rights Watch have regarded many killings to be unlawful such as the death of a 57-year-old wheelchair bound man who was shot and run over by a tank despite having attached a white flag on his wheelchair. A 37-year-old man who was paralysed was crushed under the rubble of his house, his family was not allowed to remove his body. A 14-year-old boy was killed as he travelled to purchase groceries during the temporary relief of the curfew that was imposed by the army. Medical staff were shot at (one nurse killed) while trying to reach the wounded even after clearly being in uniform displaying the red crescent symbol. There have also been reports of Israeli soldiers using Palestinians as human shields, one father described how a soldier rested his rifle on his 14-year-old son&#x27;s shoulder as he shot. Israel denied the entry of rescue teams and journalists into Jenin even after they withdrew. Over the following years, Jenin was subject to extended curfews and targeted killings.

During a gun-battle with Islamic Jihad militants whom Israel says were firing at troops from inside the UN compound, an Israeli military sniper shot and killed a UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) employee, Iain Hook (54) on November 22, 2002. The sniper reportedly mistook a cellphone in Hook&#x27;s hands for a gun or grenade.

In the framework of the Valley of Peace initiative, a joint Arab-Israeli project is under way to promote tourism in the Jenin region. In 2010, 600 new businesses opened in Jenin. The Canaan Fair Trade is headquartered in Jenin. Director of The Freedom Theatre in Jenin, Juliano Mer-Khamis, was killed by masked gunmen in the city in April 2011. Mer-Khamis co-founded the theatre with Zakaria Zubeidi, former military chief of the al-Aqsa Brigades who had renounced violence.

=== Israeli occupation in the 2020s ===
On 6 February 2020, a Palestinian policeman, Tarek Badwan, was shot dead by an Israeli sniper as he stood at the entrance to the Jenin police station and chatted with a colleague. No explanation has been forthcoming. The incident was recorded on video.

On 17 June 2022, Israeli forces conducted a raid in the al-Marah area of the city. During the raid, Israeli forces opened fire on a car, killing three Palestinians and seriously injuring another.

On 26 January 2023, Israeli forces killed nine in a clash with Islamic Jihad militants during a raid in the city and refugee camp of Jenin.

On 3 July 2023, shortly after 1 a.m., Israeli forces attacked the city&#x27;s refugee camp using drone-fired missiles and ground troops. Eight Palestinians died from injuries sustained during the attack and a further eighty were injured, nine of them critically. Fifty Palestinians, whom Israeli forces labeled &quot;militants&quot;, were arrested. Israeli forces cut off telecommunications and electricity in the area and medical professionals struggled to reach the injured. Israel claimed that while they were targeting suspected members of the Jenin Brigades, an armed group, they acknowledged that innocent people may have been injured or killed in the raid. Yoav Gallant, the Israeli Minister of Defense, said &quot;The operation is progressing as planned,&quot; and Eli Cohen, the Israeli Foreign Minister, said claimed the refugee camp had become a &quot;center for terrorist activity&quot; thanks to funding from Iranian sources. The refugee camp has a population of roughly 17,000 inhabitants and is about a quarter a square mile in size.

On 19 September 2023, four Palestinians were killed during another Israeli military invasion of the city – among them a 15-year-old Palestinian boy, chased and killed for having noticed the Israeli undercover soldiers sneaking into the Jenin refugee camp.

==== Gaza war ====
During the Gaza war, Israeli forces carried out multiple operations in Jenin. On October 22, 2023, the IDF conducted an airstrike targeting an underground compound beneath the Al-Ansar Mosque in the city. It was reported to be the first airstrike in the West Bank since the Second Intifada. The IDF stated that the strike aimed at operatives from Hamas and PIJ who were planning a terror attack.

Jenin was severely damaged during the Israel–Hamas war. By June 2024 repeated bombing attacks and incursions with bulldozers by Israeli forces razed every street and reduced every public square to rubble. In one incident on 21 May, according to journalist Gideon Levy, an Israeli sniper shot dead bystanders, including surgeon Oussaid Jabareen, who was shot while on his way to work at the Jenin Government Hospital.

In late August 2024 Israel launched a large-scale, multi-day raid on Jenin as part of Operation Summer Camps, with one resident saying that &quot;The water is cut off. The electricity is cut off, the sewage system is no longer working. All the infrastructure is destroyed, we no longer have any services that work.&quot; The governor of Jenin said that &quot;The Israelis are besieging the hospitals and cutting off the city from the refugee camp, which has become a military zone with no access...neither the civil defence, nor the ambulances, nor the journalists can go and see what is happening there.&quot; The IDF, on the other hand, says that this is operation is &quot;not extremely different from regular activity&quot;. At least 20 Palestinians were killed by the IDF in this attack, including a Palestinian man in his 80s. Additionally, the Israeli forces fired at ambulances carrying &quot;a dead and a wounded person&quot;, leading to the injury of 2 EMTs and a volunteer doctor.

Also in August, Israeli bulldozers destroyed miles of the city, including homes, businesses and infrastructure; Israeli soldiers blocked emergency responders from assisting residents. News reports include videos of this attack, as well as assertions by the Israel Defense Forces that it is rooting out terrorism; and that it &quot;undertakes all feasible precautions to avoid damaging essential infrastructure”, while acknowledging that these “operations in the area have caused unavoidable harm to certain civilian structures&quot;.

In December 2024, the Palestinian Authority launched an anti-militant operation in Jenin, the largest in three decades, called &quot;Protect the Homeland&quot;. The operation aims to regain control of the Jenin refugee camp, targeting militants and those fueling instability.

On January 21, 2025, the IDF launched its own operation in Jenin, dubbed Iron Wall, aimed at clearing Jenin of militants and putting a stop to light arms being smuggled into the city. Operations in Jenin are ongoing. Around 100 homes have been demolished, residents are being prevented from returning to the area by military checkpoints, and Israeli tanks have been deployed.

<text>Gaius Julius Vindex ( 68), was a Roman governor in the province of Gallia Lugdunensis.

==Biography==
Following normal Roman procedures, his name Gaius Julius indicated that his family had likely been given citizenship under Gaius Julius Caesar, or perhaps Emperor Augustus or Caligula. He was of a noble Gallic family of Aquitania (given senatorial status under Claudius) and was one of the men belonging to a faction of Empress Agrippina, the mother of Nero.

Vindex had taken part in a conspiracy against the emperor in 59.[citation]

===Vindex Rebellion===
In either late 67 or early 68, Vindex rebelled against Emperor Nero. Though the aims of his followers may have been more complex, Vindex, as a senator, probably had the aim simply of replacing Nero with a better emperor and ending the tyranny that plagued the empire. 

===Rise of Emperor Galba===
According to the historian Cassius Dio, Vindex &quot;was powerful in body and of shrewd intelligence, was skilled in warfare and full of daring for any great enterprise; and he had a passionate love of freedom and a vast ambition&quot;. In order to gain support, he declared his allegiance to the then governor of Hispania Tarraconensis, Servius Sulpicius Galba. By June 68, military support for Galba eventually led to Nero&#x27;s suicide. Galba, acclaimed by the Senate, struck coins to commemorate Vindex, to whom he owed his position as emperor.

===Battle of Vesontio===
The commander of the army from Germania Superior, governor Lucius Verginius Rufus, advanced against him. The Battle of Vesontio (68) took place near Vesontio (modern Besançon). What occurred then is unclear, but, despite a meeting between Verginius and Vindex, the forces under Verginius appear to have decided on a battle without orders. Desire for plunder and the weakness of Verginius as a commander are possible explanations. Vindex was defeated in the resulting battle and subsequently killed himself.

<text>Rigging comprises the system of ropes, cables and chains, which support and control a sailing ship or sail boat&#x27;s masts and sails. &quot;Standing rigging&quot; is the fixed rigging that supports masts including shrouds and stays. &quot;Running rigging&quot; is rigging which adjusts the position of the vessel&#x27;s sails and spars including halyards, braces, sheets and vangs.

==Etymology==
According to the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition &quot;rigging&quot; derives from Anglo-Saxon &quot;wrigan&quot; or &quot;wringing&quot;, &quot;to clothe&quot;. The same source points out that &quot;rigging&quot; a sailing vessel refers to putting all the components in place to allow it to function, including the masts, spars, sails and the rigging.

==History==
Theophrastus in his &quot;History of Plants&quot; ( 300 BCE) states that the rigging on King Antigonus&#x27; fleet was made from papyrus reed.

==Types of rigging==
Rigging is divided into two classes, &quot;standing&quot;, which supports the mast (and bowsprit), and &quot;running&quot;, which controls the orientation of the sails and their degree of reefing. Configurations differ for each type of rigging, between &quot;fore-and-aft rigged&quot; vessels and &quot;square-rigged&quot; vessels.

===Standing===

Standing rigging is cordage which is fixed in position. Standing rigging is almost always between a mast and the deck, using tension to hold the mast firmly in place. Due to its role, standing rigging is now most commonly made of steel cable. It was historically made of the same materials as running rigging, only coated in tar for added strength and protection from the elements.

====Fore-and-aft rigged vessels====

Most fore-and-aft rigged vessels have the following types of standing rigging: 
a forestay, a backstay, and upper and lower shrouds (side stays).
Less common rigging configurations are diamond stays and jumpers. Both of these are used to keep a thin mast in column especially under the load of a large down wind sail or in strong wind.
Rigging parts include swageless terminals, swage terminals, shackle toggle terminals and fail-safe wire rigging insulators.

====Square-rigged vessels====

Whereas 20th-century square-rigged vessels were constructed of steel with steel standing rigging, prior vessels used wood masts with hemp-fiber standing rigging. As rigs became taller by the end of the 19th century, masts relied more heavily on successive spars, stepped one atop the other to form the whole, from bottom to top: the &quot;lower mast&quot;, &quot;top mast&quot;, and &quot;topgallant mast&quot;. This construction relies heavily on support by a complex array of stays and shrouds. Each stay in either the fore-and-aft or athwartships direction has a corresponding one in the opposite direction providing counter-tension. Fore-and-aft the system of tensioning start with the stays that are anchored in front of each mast. Shrouds are tensioned by pairs of deadeyes, circular blocks that have the large-diameter line run around them, whilst multiple holes allow smaller line—&quot;lanyards&quot;—to pass multiple times between the two and thereby allow tensioning of the shroud. In addition to overlapping the mast below, the top mast and topgallant mast are supported laterally by shrouds that pass around either a platform, called a &quot;top&quot;, or cross-wise beams, called &quot;crosstrees&quot;. Each additional mast segment is supported fore and aft by a series of stays that lead forward. These lines are countered in tension by backstays, which are secured along the sides of the vessel behind the shrouds.

===Running===

Running rigging is the cordage used to control the shape and position of the sails. Materials have evolved from the use of Manilla rope to synthetic fibers, which include dacron, nylon and kevlar. Running rigging varies between &quot;fore-and-aft rigged&quot; vessels and &quot;square-rigged&quot; vessels. They have common functions between them for supporting, shaping and orienting sails, which employ different mechanisms. For supporting sails, halyards (sometimes haulyards), are used to raise sails and control luff tension. On gaff-rigged vessels, topping lifts hold the yards across the top of the sail aloft. Sail shape is usually controlled by lines that pull at the corners of the sail, including the outhaul at the clew and the downhaul at the tack on fore-and-aft rigs. The orientation of sails to the wind is controlled primarily by sheets, but also by braces, which position the yard arms with respect to the wind on square-rigged vessels.

<text>Sir Charles Kao Kuen () (November 4, 1933 – September 23, 2018) was a Chinese physicist and Nobel laureate who contributed to the development and use of fibre optics in telecommunications. In the 1960s, Kao created various methods to combine glass fibres with lasers in order to transmit digital data, which laid the groundwork for the evolution of the Internet and the eventual creation of the World Wide Web.

Kao was born in Shanghai. His family settled in Hong Kong in 1949. He graduated from St. Joseph&#x27;s College in Hong Kong in 1952 and went to London to study electrical engineering. In the 1960s, Kao worked at Standard Telecommunication Laboratories, the research center of Standard Telephones and Cables (STC) in Harlow, and it was here in 1966 that he laid the groundwork for fibre optics in communication. Known as the &quot;godfather of broadband&quot;, the &quot;father of fibre optics&quot;, and the &quot;father of fibre optic communications&quot;, he continued his work in Hong Kong at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and in the United States at ITT (the parent corporation for STC) and Yale University. Kao was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for &quot;groundbreaking achievements concerning the transmission of light in fibres for optical communication&quot;. In 2010, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for &quot;services to fibre optic communications&quot;.

Kao was a permanent resident of Hong Kong, and a citizen of the United Kingdom and the United States.

==Early life and education==
Charles Kao was born in Shanghai in 1933 and lived with his parents in the Shanghai French Concession. He studied Chinese classics at home with his brother, under a tutor. He also studied English and French at the Shanghai World School () that was founded by a number of progressive Chinese educators, including Cai Yuanpei.

After the Communist revolution, Kao&#x27;s family settled in Hong Kong in 1949. Much of his mother&#x27;s siblings moved to Hong Kong in the late 1930s, among them, his mother&#x27;s youngest brother took good care of him.

Kao&#x27;s family lived in Lau Sin Street, at the edge of the North Point, a neighbourhood of Shanghai immigrants. During Kao&#x27;s time in Hong Kong, he studied at St. Joseph&#x27;s College for 5 years and graduated in 1952.

Kao obtained high score in the Hong Kong School Certificate Examination, which at the time was the territory&#x27;s matriculation examination, qualifying him for admission to the University of Hong Kong. However, at the time electrical engineering wasn&#x27;t a programme available at the University of Hong Kong, the territory&#x27;s then only teritary education institute.

Hence in 1953, Kao went to London to continue his studies in secondary school and obtained his A-Level in 1955. He was later admitted to Woolwich Polytechnic (now the University of Greenwich) and obtained his Bachelor of Electrical Engineering degree. He then pursued research and received his PhD in electrical engineering in 1965 from the University of London, under Professor Harold Barlow of University College London as an external student while working at Standard Telecommunication Laboratories (STL) in Harlow, England, the research center of Standard Telephones and Cables.

=== Ancestry and family ===
Kao&#x27;s father (), originally from Jinshan City (now a district of Shanghai City), obtained his Juris Doctor from the University of Michigan Law School in 1925. He was a judge at the Shanghai Concession and later a professor at Soochow University (then in Shanghai) Comparative Law School of China.

His grandfather Kao Hsieh was a scholar, poet and artist, Several writers including Kao Hsü, (), and () were also Kao&#x27;s close relatives.

His father&#x27;s cousin was astronomer Kao Ping-tse (Kao crater is named after him). Kao&#x27;s younger brother Timothy Wu Kao () is a civil engineer and Professor Emeritus at the Catholic University of America. His research is in hydrodynamics.

Kao met his future wife Gwen May-Wan Kao (née Wong; ) in London after graduation, when they worked together as engineers at Standard Telephones and Cables. She was British Chinese. They were married in 1959 in London, and had a son and a daughter, both of whom reside and work in Silicon Valley, California. According to Kao&#x27;s autobiography, Kao was a Catholic who attended Catholic Church while his wife attended the Anglican Communion.

==Academic career==

===Fibre optics and communications===
In the 1960s at Standard Telecommunication Laboratories (STL) based in Harlow, Essex, England, Kao and his coworkers did their pioneering work in creating fibre optics as a telecommunications medium, by demonstrating that the high-loss of existing fibre optics arose from impurities in the glass, rather than from an underlying problem with the technology itself.

In 1963, when Kao first joined the optical communications research team he made notes summarising the background situation and available technology at the time, and identifying the key individuals involved. Initially Kao worked in the team of Antoni E. Karbowiak (Toni Karbowiak), who was working under Alec Reeves to study optical waveguides for communications. Kao&#x27;s task was to investigate fibre attenuation, for which he collected samples from different fibre manufacturers and also investigated the properties of bulk glasses carefully. Kao&#x27;s study primarily convinced him that the impurities in material caused the high light losses of those fibres. Later that year, Kao was appointed head of the electro-optics research group at STL. He took over the optical communication program of STL in December 1964, because his supervisor, Karbowiak, left to take the chair in Communications in the School of Electrical Engineering at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney, Australia.

Although Kao succeeded Karbowiak as manager of optical communications research, he immediately decided to abandon Karbowiak&#x27;s plan (thin-film waveguide) and overall change research direction with his colleague George Hockham. They not only considered optical physics but also the material properties. The results were first presented by Kao to the IEE in January 1966 in London, and further published in July with George Hockham (1964–1965 worked with Kao). This study proposed the use of glass fibres for optical communication. The concepts described, especially the electromagnetic theory and performance parameters, are the basis of today&#x27;s optical fibre communications.
In 1965, Kao with Hockham concluded that the fundamental limitation for glass light attenuation is below 20 &quot;dB/km&quot; (&quot;decibels per kilometer&quot;, is a measure of the attenuation of a signal over a distance), which is a key threshold value for optical communications. However, at the time of this determination, optical fibres commonly exhibited light loss as high as 1,000 dB/km and even more. This conclusion opened the intense race to find low-loss materials and suitable fibres for reaching such criteria.

Kao, together with his new team (members including T. W. Davies, M. W. Jones and C. R. Wright), pursued this goal by testing various materials. They precisely measured the attenuation of light with different wavelengths in glasses and other materials. During this period, Kao pointed out that the high purity of fused silica (SiO2) made it an ideal candidate for optical communication. Kao also stated that the impurity of glass material is the main cause for the dramatic decay of light transmission inside glass fibre, rather than fundamental physical effects such as scattering as many physicists thought at that time, and such impurity could be removed. This led to a worldwide study and production of high-purity glass fibres. When Kao first proposed that such glass fibre could be used for long-distance information transfer and could replace copper wires which were used for telecommunication during that era, his ideas were widely disbelieved; later people realized that Kao&#x27;s ideas revolutionized the whole communication technology and industry.

He also played a leading role in the early stage of engineering and commercial realization of optical communication. In spring 1966, Kao traveled to the U.S. but failed to interest Bell Labs, which was a competitor of STL in communication technology at that time. He subsequently traveled to Japan and gained support. Kao visited many glass and polymer factories, discussed with various people including engineers, scientists, businessmen about the techniques and improvement of glass fibre manufacture. In 1969, Kao with M. W. Jones measured the intrinsic loss of bulk-fused silica at 4 dB/km, which is the first evidence of ultra-transparent glass. Bell Labs started considering fibre optics seriously. As of 2017, fibre optic losses (from both bulk and intrinsic sources) are as low as 0.1419 dB/km at the 1.56 μm wavelength.

Kao developed important techniques and configurations for glass fibre waveguides, and contributed to the development of different fibre types and system devices which met both civil and military application requirements, and peripheral supporting systems for optical fibre communication. In mid-1970s, he did seminal work on glass fibre fatigue strength. When named the first ITT Executive Scientist, Kao launched the &quot;Terabit Technology&quot; program in addressing the high frequency limits of signal processing, so Kao is also known as the &quot;father of the terabit technology concept&quot;. Kao has published more than 100 papers and was granted over 30 patents, including the water-resistant high-strength fibres (with M. S. Maklad).

At an early stage of developing optic fibres, Kao already strongly preferred single-mode for long-distance optical communication, instead of using multi-mode systems. His vision later was followed and now is applied almost exclusively. Kao was also a visionary of modern submarine communications cables and largely promoted this idea. He predicted in 1983 that world&#x27;s seas would be littered with fibre optics, five years ahead of the time that such a trans-oceanic fibre-optic cable first became serviceable.

Ali Javan&#x27;s introduction of a steady helium–neon laser and Kao&#x27;s discovery of fibre light-loss properties now are recognized as the two essential milestones for the development of fibre-optic communications.

===Later work===
Kao joined the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in 1970 to found the Department of Electronics, which later became the Department of Electronic Engineering. During this period, Kao was the reader and then the chair Professor of Electronics at CUHK; he built up both undergraduate and graduate study programs of electronics and oversaw the graduation of his first students. Under his leadership, the School of Education and other new research institutes were established. He returned to ITT Corporation in 1974 (the parent corporation of STC at that time) in the United States and worked in Roanoke, Virginia, first as Chief Scientist and later as Director of Engineering. In 1982, he became the first ITT Executive Scientist and was stationed mainly at the Advanced Technology Center in Connecticut. While there, he served as an adjunct professor and Fellow of Trumbull College at Yale University. In 1985, Kao spent one year in West Germany, at the SEL Research Center. In 1986, Kao was the Corporate Director of Research at ITT.

He was one of the earliest to study the environmental effects of land reclamation in Hong Kong, and presented one of his first related studies at the conference of the Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU) in Edinburgh in 1972.

Kao was the vice-chancellor of the Chinese University of Hong Kong from 1987 to 1996. From 1991, Kao was an Independent Non-Executive Director and a member of the Audit Committee of the Varitronix International Limited in Hong Kong. From 1993 to 1994, he was the President of the Association of Southeast Asian Institutions of Higher Learning (ASAIHL). In 1996, Kao donated to Yale University, and the &quot;Charles Kao Fund Research Grants&quot; was established to support Yale&#x27;s studies, research and creative projects in Asia. The fund currently is managed by Yale University Councils on East Asian and Southeast Asian Studies. After his retirement from CUHK in 1996, Kao spent his six-month sabbatical leave at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering of Imperial College London; from 1997 to 2002, he also served as visiting professor in the same department.

Kao was chairman and member of the Energy Advisory Committee (EAC) of Hong Kong for two years, and retired from the position on July 15, 2000. Kao was a member of the Council of Advisors on Innovation and Technology of Hong Kong, appointed on April 20, 2000. In 2000, Kao co-founded the Independent Schools Foundation Academy, which is located in Cyberport, Hong Kong. He was its founding chairman in 2000, and stepped down from the board of the ISF in December 2008. Kao was the keynote speaker at IEEE GLOBECOM 2002 in Taipei, Taiwan. In 2003, Kao was named a Chair Professor by special appointment at the Electronics Institute of the College of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, National Taiwan University. Kao then worked as the chairman and CEO of Transtech Services Ltd., a telecommunication consultancy in Hong Kong. He was the founder, chairman and CEO of ITX Services Limited. From 2003 to January 30, 2009, Kao was an independent non-executive director and member of the audit committee of Next Media.

== Later life and death ==
Kao&#x27;s international travels led him to opine that he belonged to the world instead of any country. An open letter published by Kao and his wife in 2010 later clarified that &quot;Charles studied in Hong Kong for his high schooling, he has taught here, he was the Vice-Chancellor of CUHK and retired here too. So he is a Hong Kong belonger.&quot;

Pottery making was a hobby of Kao&#x27;s. Kao also enjoyed reading Wuxia (Chinese martial fantasy) novels.

Kao suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease from early 2004 and had speech difficulty, but had no problem recognising people or addresses. His father suffered from the same disease. Beginning in 2008, he resided in Mountain View, California, United States, where he moved from Hong Kong in order to live near his children and grandchild.

On October 6, 2009, when Kao was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his contributions to the study of the transmission of light in optical fibres and for fibre communication, he said, &quot;I am absolutely speechless and never expected such an honor.&quot; Kao&#x27;s wife Gwen told the press that the prize will primarily be used for Charles&#x27;s medical expenses. In 2010 Charles and Gwen Kao founded the Charles K. Kao Foundation for Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease to raise public awareness about the disease and provide support for the patients.

In 2016, Kao lost the ability to maintain his balance. At the end-stage of his dementia he was cared for by his wife and intended not to be kept alive with life support or have CPR performed on him. Kao passed away at Bradbury Hospice in Hong Kong on September 23, 2018, at the age of 84.

<doc id="51013" wikidata="Q61740871" url="?curid=51013" title="Slurry pipeline">
<text>A slurry pipeline is a specially engineered pipeline used to move ores, such as coal or iron, or mining waste, called tailings, over long distances. A mixture of the ore concentrate and water, called slurry, is pumped to its destination and the water is filtered out. Due to the abrasive properties of slurry, the pipelines can be lined with high-density polyethylene (HDPE), or manufactured completely from HDPE Pipe, although this requires a very thick pipe wall. Slurry pipelines are used as an alternative to railroad transportation when mines are located in remote, inaccessible areas.

Canadian researchers at the University of Alberta are investigating the use of slurry pipelines to move agricultural and forestry wastes from dispersed sources to centralized biofuel plants. Over distances of 100 kilometres pipeline transport of biomass can be viable provided it is used in processes that can accept very wet feedstocks such as hydrothermal liquefaction or ethanol fermentation. Compared to an equivalently sized oil pipeline, a biomass slurry pipeline would carry around 8% of the energy.

== Process ==
The concentrate of the ore is mixed with water and then pumped over a long distance to a port where it can be shipped for further processing. At the end of the pipeline, the material is separated from the [slurry] in a filter press to remove the water. This water is usually subjected to a waste treatment process before disposal or return to the mine. Slurry pipelines offer an economic advantage over railroad transport and much less noise disturbance to the environment, particularly when mines are in extremely remote areas.

Pipelines must be suitably engineered to resist abrasion from the solids as well as corrosion from the soil. Some of these pipelines are lined with high-density polyethylene (HDPE).

Typical materials that are transferred using slurry pipelines include coal, copper, iron, and phosphate concentrates, limestone, lead, zinc, nickel, bauxite and oil sands.

Slurry pipelines are also used to transport tailings from a mineral processing plant after the ore has been processed in order to dispose of the remaining rocks or clays.

For oil sand plants, a mixture of oil sand and water may be pumped over a long distance to release the bitumen by ablation. These pipelines are also called hydrotransport pipelines.

==History==
Early modern slurry pipelines include The Ohio &#x27;Consolidation&#x27; coal slurry pipeline (1957) and the Kensworth to Rugby limestone slurry pipeline (1965) 

The 85 km Savage River Slurry pipeline in Tasmania, Australia, was possibly the world&#x27;s first slurry pipeline to transport iron ore when it was built in 1967. It includes a 366m bridge span at 167m above the Savage River. It carries iron ore slurry from the Savage River open cut mine owned by Australian Bulk Minerals and was still operational as of 2011.

==Planned projects==
One of the longest slurry pipelines was to be the proposed ETSI pipeline, to transport coal from Wyoming to Louisiana over a distance of 1036 miles (1675 km). It was never commissioned. It is anticipated that in the next few years some long distance slurry pipelines will be constructed in Australia and South America where mineral deposits are often a few hundred kilometers away from shipping ports.

A 525 km slurry pipeline is planned for the Minas-Rio iron ore mine in Brazil.

Slurry pipelines are also being considered to desilt or remove silts from deposits behind dams in man-made lakes. After the Hurricane Katrina disaster there were proposals to remedy the environment by pumping silt to the shore. Proposals have also been made to de-silt Lake Nubia-Nasser in Egypt and Sudan by slurry pipelines, as Egypt is now deprived of 95% of its alluvium, which used to arrive every year. These projects to remedy the environment might alleviate one of the major problems associated with large dams and man-made lakes.

ESSAR Steel India Limited owns two &gt;250 km slurry pipelines in India; the Kirandul-Vishakhapatnam (slurry pipeline) and Dabuna-Paradeep pipeline.

<doc id="51017" wikidata="Q150986" url="?curid=51017" title="Siren (mythology)">
<text>In Greek mythology, sirens () are female humanlike beings with alluring voices; they appear in a scene in the &quot;Odyssey&quot; in which Odysseus saves his crew&#x27;s lives. Roman poets place them on some small islands called Sirenum scopuli. In some later, rationalized traditions, the literal geography of the &quot;flowery&quot; island of Anthemoessa, or Anthemusa, is fixed: sometimes on Cape Pelorum and at others in the islands known as the Sirenuse, near Paestum, or in Capreae. All such locations were surrounded by cliffs and rocks.

Sirens continued to be used as a symbol of the dangerous temptation embodied by women regularly throughout Christian art of the medieval era. &quot;Siren&quot; can also be used as a slang term for a woman considered both very attractive and dangerous.

== Nomenclature ==

The etymology of the name is contested. Robert S. P. Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek origin. Others connect the name to σειρά (&quot;seirá&quot;, &quot;rope, cord&quot;) and εἴρω (&quot;eírō&quot;, &quot;to tie, join, fasten&quot;), resulting in the meaning &quot;binder, entangler&quot;, i.e. one who binds or entangles through magic song. This could be connected to the famous scene of Odysseus being bound to the mast of his ship, to resist their song.

Sirens were later often used as a synonym for mermaids and portrayed with upper human bodies and fish tails. This combination became iconic in the medieval period. The circumstances leading to the commingling involve the treatment of sirens in the medieval &quot;Physiologus&quot; and bestiaries, both iconographically, as well as textually in translations from Latin to vulgar languages, as described below.

== Iconography ==
=== Classical iconography ===
The sirens of Greek mythology first appeared in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, where Homer did not provide any physical descriptions, and their visual appearance was left to the readers&#x27; imagination. It was Apollonius of Rhodes in &quot;Argonautica&quot; (3rd century BC) who described the sirens in writing as part woman and part bird. By the 7th century BC, sirens were regularly depicted in art as human-headed birds. They may have been influenced by the ba-bird of Egyptian religion. In early Greek art, the sirens were generally represented as large birds with women&#x27;s heads, bird feathers and scaly feet. Later depictions shifted to show sirens with human upper bodies and bird legs, with or without wings. They were often shown playing a variety of musical instruments, especially the lyre, kithara, and aulos.

The tenth-century Byzantine dictionary &quot;Suda&quot; stated that sirens () had the form of sparrows from their chests up, and below they were women or that they were little birds with women&#x27;s faces.

Originally, sirens were shown as male or female, but the male siren disappeared from art around the fifth century BC.

==== Early siren-mermaids ====

Some surviving Classical period examples had already depicted the siren as mermaid-like. The sirens are described as mermaids or &quot;tritonesses&quot; in examples dating to the 3rd century BC, including an earthenware bowl found in Athens and a terracotta oil lamp possibly from the Roman period.

The first known literary attestation of siren as a &quot;mermaid&quot; appeared in the Anglo-Latin catalogue &quot;Liber Monstrorum&quot; (early 8th century AD), where it says that sirens were &quot;sea-girls... with the body of a maiden, but have scaly fishes&#x27; tails&quot;.

=== Medieval Iconography ===
The siren appeared in several illustrated manuscripts of the &quot;Physiologus&quot; and its successors called the bestiaries. The siren was depicted as a half-woman and half-fish mermaid in the 9th century Berne &quot;Physiologus&quot;, as an early example, but continued to be illustrated with both bird-like parts (wings, clawed feet) and fish-like tail.

== Classical literature ==
=== Family tree ===

Although a Sophocles fragment makes Phorcys their father, when sirens are named, they are usually as daughters of the river god Achelous, either by the Muse Terpsichore, Melpomene or Calliope or lastly by Sterope, daughter of King Porthaon of Calydon.

In Euripides&#x27;s play &quot;Helen&quot; (167), Helen in her anguish calls upon &quot;Winged maidens, daughters of the Earth (Chthon).&quot; Although they lured mariners, the Greeks portrayed the sirens in their &quot;meadow starred with flowers&quot; and not as sea deities. Epimenides claimed that the sirens were children of Oceanus and Ge. Sirens are found in many Greek stories, notably in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;.
=== List of sirens ===
Their number is variously reported as from two to eight. In the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Homer says nothing of their origin or names, but gives the number of the sirens as two. Later writers mention both their names and number: some state that there were three, Peisinoe, Aglaope and Thelxiepeia or Aglaonoe, Aglaopheme and Thelxiepeia; Parthenope, Ligeia, and Leucosia; Apollonius followed Hesiod gives their names as Thelxinoe, Molpe, and Aglaophonos; Suidas gives their names as Thelxiepeia, Peisinoe, and Ligeia; Hyginus gives the number of the sirens as four: Teles, Raidne, Molpe, and Thelxiope; Eustathius states that they were two, Aglaopheme and Thelxiepeia; an ancient vase painting attests the two names as Himerope and Thelxiepeia.

Their names are variously rendered in the later sources as Thelxiepeia/Thelxiope/Thelxinoe, Molpe, Himerope, Aglaophonos/Aglaope/Aglaopheme, Pisinoe/Peisinoë/Peisithoe, Parthenope, Ligeia, Leucosia, Raidne, and Teles.
*Molpe ()
*Thelxiepeia () or Thelxiope () &quot;eye pleasing&quot;)
===Mythology===
==== Demeter ====

According to Ovid (43 BC–17 AD), the sirens were the companions of young Persephone. Demeter gave them wings to search for Persephone when she was abducted by Hades. However, the &quot;Fabulae&quot; of Hyginus (64 BC–17 AD) has Demeter cursing the sirens for failing to intervene in the abduction of Persephone. According to Hyginus, sirens were fated to live only until the mortals who heard their songs could pass by them.

==== The Muses ====
One legend says that Hera, queen of the gods, persuaded the Sirens to enter a singing contest with the Muses. The Muses won the competition and then plucked out all of the sirens&#x27; feathers and made crowns out of them. Out of their anguish from losing the competition, writes Stephanus of Byzantium, the sirens turned white and fell into the sea at Aptera (&quot;featherless&quot;), where they formed the islands in the bay that were called &quot;Leukai&quot; (&quot;the white ones&quot;, modern Souda).

==== &quot;Argonautica&quot; ====
In the &quot;Argonautica&quot; (third century BC), Jason had been warned by Chiron that Orpheus would be necessary in his journey. When Orpheus heard their voices, he drew out his lyre and played his music more beautifully than they, drowning out their voices. One of the crew, however, the sharp-eared hero Butes, heard the song and leapt into the sea, but he was caught up and carried safely away by the goddess Aphrodite.

==== &quot;Odyssey&quot; ====

Odysseus was curious as to what the sirens sang to him, and so, on the advice of Circe, he had all of his sailors plug their ears with beeswax and tie him to the mast. He ordered his men to leave him tied tightly to the mast, no matter how much he might beg. When he heard their beautiful song, he ordered the sailors to untie him but they bound him tighter. When they had passed out of earshot, Odysseus demonstrated with his frowns to be released. Some post-Homeric authors state that the sirens were fated to die if someone heard their singing and escaped them, and that after Odysseus passed by they therefore flung themselves into the water and perished.

==== Pliny ====
The first-century Roman historian Pliny the Elder discounted sirens as a pure fable, &quot;although Dinon, the father of Clearchus, a celebrated writer, asserts that they exist in India, and that they charm men by their song, and, having first lulled them to sleep, tear them to pieces.&quot; 

=== Sirens and death===

Statues of sirens in a funerary context are attested since the classical era, in mainland Greece, as well as Asia Minor and Magna Graecia. The so-called &quot;Siren of Canosa&quot;—Canosa di Puglia is a site in Apulia that was part of Magna Graecia—was said to accompany the dead among grave goods in a burial. She appeared to have some psychopomp characteristics, guiding the dead on the afterlife journey. The cast terracotta figure bears traces of its original white pigment. The woman bears the feet, wings and tail of a bird. The sculpture is conserved in the National Archaeological Museum of Spain, in Madrid.
The sirens were called the Muses of the lower world. Classical scholar Walter Copland Perry (1814–1911) observed: &quot;Their song, though irresistibly sweet, was no less sad than sweet, and lapped both body and soul in a fatal lethargy, the forerunner of death and corruption.&quot; Their song is continually calling on Persephone.

The term &quot;&quot; refers to an appeal that is hard to resist but that, if heeded, will lead to a bad conclusion. Later writers have implied that the sirens ate humans, based on Circe&#x27;s description of them &quot;lolling there in their meadow, round them heaps of corpses rotting away, rags of skin shriveling on their bones.&quot; As linguist Jane Ellen Harrison (1850–1928) notes of &quot;The Ker as siren&quot;: &quot;It is strange and beautiful that Homer should make the sirens appeal to the spirit, not to the flesh.&quot; The siren song is a promise to Odysseus of mantic truths; with a false promise that he will live to tell them, they sing,

&quot;They are mantic creatures like the Sphinx with whom they have much in common, knowing both the past and the future&quot;, Harrison observed. &quot;Their song takes effect at midday, in a windless calm. The end of that song is death.&quot; That the sailors&#x27; flesh is rotting away, suggests it has not been eaten. It has been suggested that, with their feathers stolen, their divine nature kept them alive, but unable to provide food for their visitors, who starved to death by refusing to leave.

== Early Christian to Medieval ==

=== Book of Enoch ===
According to the ancient Hebrew Book of Enoch, the women who were led astray by the fallen angels will be turned into sirens.

=== Late antiquity ===
By the fourth century, when pagan beliefs were overtaken by Christianity, 

Saint Jerome, who produced the Latin Vulgate version of the bible, used the word &quot;sirens&quot; to translate Hebrew &quot;tannīm&quot; (&quot;jackals&quot;) in the Book of Isaiah 13:22, and also to translate a word for &quot;owls&quot; in the Book of Jeremiah 50:39.

The siren is allegorically described as a beautiful courtesan or prostitute, who sings pleasant melodies to men, and is the symbolic vice of Pleasure in the preaching of Clement of Alexandria (2nd century). Later writers such as Ambrose (4th century) reiterated the notion that the siren stood as a symbol or allegory for worldly temptations. and not an endorsement of the Greek myth.

=== Isidorus ===
The early Christian euhemerist interpretation of mythologized human beings received a long-lasting boost from the &quot;Etymologiae&quot; by Isidore of Seville (c. 560–636):
=== Physiologus and bestiaries ===

==== The allegorical texts ====
The siren and the onocentaur, two hybrid creatures, appear as the subject of a single chapter in the &quot;Physiologus&quot;, as they appear together in the Septuagint translation of the aforementioned Isaiah 13:21–22, and 34:14. They also appear together in some Latin bestiaries of the First Family subgroup called B-Isidore (&quot;B-Is&quot;).

==== The miniatures ====


The siren&#x27;s bird-like description from classical sources was retained in the Latin version of the &quot;Physiologus&quot; (6th century) and several subsequent bestiaries into the 13th century, but at some time during the interim, the mermaid shape was introduced to this body of works. 

;As woman-fish or mermaid
{{further|Mermaid#Sirens}}
The siren was illustrated as a woman-fish (mermaid) in the &quot;Bern Physiologus&quot; dated to the mid-9th century, even though this contradicted the accompanying text which described it as avian.{{Refn|name=&quot;berne-physiologus&quot;|Berne, Bürgerbibliotek Cod. 318. fol. 13v. Rubric: &quot;De Natura Serena et honocentauri&quot;.}} An English-made Latin bestiary dated 1220–1250 also depicted a group of sirens as mermaids with fishtails swimming in the sea, even though the text stated they resembled winged fowl ({{lang|la|volatilis habet figuram}}) down to their feet.{{Refn|Oxford, MS Bodley 764, fol. 74v.{{sfnp|Hardwick|2011|p=92}}}}{{Refn|group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;|There is another entry for &quot;siren&quot;, as a winged white serpent of Arabia.{{sfnp|Barber tr.|1993|p=150}}}}

Illustrating the siren as a pure mermaid became commonplace in the &quot;second family&quot; bestiaries, and she was shown holding a musical instrument in the classical tradition, but also sometimes holding apparently an eel-fish.{{sfnp|Clark|2006|loc=p. 57 and n50}} An example of the siren-mermaid holding such a fish is found in one of the earlier codices in this group, dated the late 12th century.{{efn|Brit. Lib. Add. 11283, late 12c., {{harvp|Clark|2006|p=21}}, fol. 20v{{sfnp|Clark|2006|loc=p. 52 and Fig. 20}}}}{{sfnp|Druce|1915|loc=pp. 174–175, Pl. X, No. 2}}

;As bird-like
A counterexample is also given where the illustrated sirens (group of three) are bird-like, conforming to the text.{{Refn|Oxford, MS Bodley 602, fol. 10r. 12th century.}}

;As hybrid
The siren was sometimes drawn as a hybrid with a human torso, a fish-like lower body, and bird-like wings and feet. While in the Harley 3244 (cf. fig. top right) the wings sprout from around the shoulders, in other hybrid types, the style places the siren&#x27;s wings &quot;hanging at the waist&quot;.{{Refn|Cambridge University Library Ii.4.26, fol. 39v.}}{{Refn|Compare Northumberland bestiary (Getty MS 100) (olim Alnwick bestiary, Alnwick Castle MS 447). Comment of &quot;webbed feet&quot; in the two examples{{sfnp|George|Yapp|1991|p=99}} seems false for the CUL ms., while &quot;webbed feet of an aquatic animal&quot; is corroborated for the Northumberland bestiary.}}

;Comb and mirror

Also, a siren may be holding a comb,{{sfnp|George|Yapp|1991|p=99}}{{Refn|Or there may be three sirens drawn, two holding fish and third a mirror, as in Getty MS. 100 (olim Alnwick ms.){{sfnp|George|Yapp|1991|p=99}} A similar composition occurs on the Morgan M.81, cf. fig. right.}} or a mirror.{{Refn|British Library Ms. Royal 2.B.Vii, fol. 96v.{{sfnp|George|Yapp|1991|p=99}}}}

Thus the comb and mirror, which are now emblematic of mermaids across Europe, derive from the bestiaries that describe the siren as a vain creature requiring those accoutrements.{{sfnp|Waugh|1960|p=77}}

==== Verse bestiaries ====
Later, bestiary texts appeared which were modified to accommodate the artistic conventions.{{sfnp|Holford-Strevens|2006|p=34}}

It is explained that the siren&#x27;s &quot;other part&quot; may be &quot;like fish or like bird&quot; in Guillaume le clerc&#x27;s Old French verse bestiary (1210 or 1211),{{Refn|&quot;l&#x27;altre partie est figuree / Come peisson ou con oisel&quot; (vv. 1058–1059).}}{{sfnp|Waugh|1960|p=77}} as well as Philippe de Thaun&#x27;s Anglo-Norman verse bestiary (c. 1121–1139).{{sfnp|Holford-Strevens|2006|p=34}}

=== Derivative literature ===
There also appeared medieval works that conflated sirens with mermaids while citing &quot;Physiologus&quot; as their source.{{Refn|Hugh of St. Victor (d.1240), &quot;De bestiis et aliis rebus&quot; XCVII, quoted in Latin by {{harvp|Mustard|1908|p=23}}, and in translation by {{harvp|Holford-Strevens|2006|p=32}}: &quot;sirens.., as the Physiologus describes them have a woman&#x27;s form above down to the navel, but their lower part down to the feet has the shape of a fish&quot;. The work continues &quot;excerpts from Servius and Isidore&quot; to say: &quot;three Sirens, part maids, part fish, of whom one sang..etc.&quot;. But despite attribution to Hugh, this work had so heavily interpolated that it has been a 16th century compilation, and dubbed a &quot;problematic&quot; bestiary. Cf. {{harvp|Clark|2006|pp=10–11}}: Chapter 1: The Problematic &quot;De bestiis et aliis rebus&quot;.}}

Italian poet Dante Alighieri depicts a siren in Canto 19 of &quot;Purgatorio&quot;, the second canticle of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. Here, the pilgrim dreams of a female who is described as &quot;stuttering, cross-eyed, and crooked on her feet, with stunted hands, and pallid in color.&quot; It is not until the pilgrim &quot;gazes&quot; upon her that she is turned desirable and is revealed by herself to be a siren. This siren then claims that she &quot;turned Ulysses from his course, desirous of my / song, and whoever becomes used to me rarely / leaves me, so wholly do I satisfy him!&quot; Given that Dante did not have access to the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, the siren&#x27;s claim that she turned Ulysses from his course is inherently false because the sirens in the &quot;Odyssey&quot; do not manage to turn Ulysses from his path. Ulysses and his men were warned by Circe and prepared for their encounter by stuffing their ears full of wax, except for Ulysses, who wishes to be bound to the ship&#x27;s mast as he wants to hear the siren&#x27;s song. Scholars claim that Dante may have &quot;misinterpreted&quot; the siren&#x27;s claim from an episode in Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De finibus.&quot; The pilgrim&#x27;s dream comes to an end when a lady &quot;holy and quick&quot; who had not yet been present before suddenly appears and says, &quot;O Virgil, Virgil, who is this?&quot; Virgil, the pilgrim&#x27;s guide, then steps forward and tears the clothes from the siren&#x27;s belly which, &quot;awakened me [the pilgrim] with the stench that issued from it.&quot; This marks the ending of the encounter between the pilgrim and the siren.

In Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; ({{circa|1136}}), Brutus of Troy encounters sirens at the Pillars of Hercules on his way to Britain to fulfil a prophecy that he will establish an empire there. The sirens surround and nearly overturn his ships until Brutus escapes to the Tyrrhenian Sea.

=== Renaissance ===
By the time of the Renaissance, female court musicians known as courtesans filled the role of an unmarried companion, and musical performances by unmarried women could be seen as immoral. Seen as a creature who could control a man&#x27;s reason, female singers became associated with the mythological figure of the siren, who usually took a half-human, half-animal form somewhere on the cusp between nature and culture.

Leonardo da Vinci wrote of them in his notebooks, stating &quot;The siren sings so sweetly that she lulls the mariners to sleep; then she climbs upon the ships and kills the sleeping mariners.&quot;

=== Age of Exploration ===
However, in the 17th century, some Jesuit writers began to assert their actual existence, including Cornelius a Lapide, who said of woman, &quot;her glance is that of the fabled basilisk, her voice a siren&#x27;s voice—with her voice she enchants, with her beauty she deprives of reason—voice and sight alike deal destruction and death.&quot; Antonio de Lorea also argued for their existence, and Athanasius Kircher argued that compartments must have been built for them aboard Noah&#x27;s Ark.

=== Late Modernity (1801–1900) ===
Charles Burney expounded {{circa|1789}}, in &quot;A General History of Music&quot;: &quot;The name, according to Bochart, who derives it from the Phoenician, implies a &quot;songstress.&quot; Hence it is probable, that in ancient times there may have been excellent singers, but of corrupt morals, on the coast of Sicily, who by seducing voyagers, gave rise to this fable.&quot;

John Lemprière in his &quot;Classical Dictionary&quot; (1827) wrote, &quot;Some suppose that the sirens were several lascivious women in Sicily, who prostituted themselves to strangers, and made them forget their pursuits while drowned in unlawful pleasures. The etymology of Bochart, who deduces the name from a Phoenician term denoting a &quot;songstress,&quot; favours the explanation given of the fable by Damm. This distinguished critic makes the sirens to have been excellent singers, and divesting the fables respecting them of all their terrific features, he supposes that by the charms of music and song, they detained travellers, and made them altogether forgetful of their native land.&quot;

== Arts and influence ==
The French impressionist composer, Claude Debussy, composed the orchestral work &quot;Nocturnes&quot; in which the third movement, &quot;Sirènes&quot;, depicts sirens. According to Debussy, &quot;&#x27;Sirènes&#x27; depicts the sea and its countless rhythms and presently, amongst the waves silvered by the moonlight, is heard the mysterious song of the Sirens as they laugh and pass on&quot;.

In 1911, French composer Lili Boulanger composed &quot;Les sirènes&quot; for mezzo-soprano soloist, choir, and piano.

Contemporary British composer and former child prodigy, Alma Deutscher, composed &quot;Waltz of the Sirens&quot;, an orchestral work based on the mythology creature.

English artist William Etty portrayed the sirens as young women in fully human form in his 1837 painting &quot;The Sirens and Ulysses&quot;, a practice copied by future artists.

<text>A civil defense siren is a siren used to provide an emergency population warning to the general population of approaching danger. Initially designed to warn city dwellers of air raids (air-raid sirens) during World War II, they were later used to warn of nuclear attack and natural disasters, such as tornadoes (tornado sirens). The generalized nature of sirens led to many of them being replaced with more specific warnings, such as the broadcast-based Emergency Alert System and the Cell Broadcast-based Wireless Emergency Alerts and EU-Alert mobile technologies.

By use of varying tones or binary patterns of sound, different alert conditions can be called. Electronic sirens can transmit voice announcements in addition to alert tone signals. Siren systems may be electronically controlled and integrated into other warning systems.

==Sirens in integrated public warning systems==
Sirens are sometimes integrated into a warning system that links sirens with other warning media, such as the radio and TV Emergency Alert System, NOAA Weather Radio, telephone alerting systems, Reverse 911, Cable Override, and wireless alerting systems in the United States and the National Public Alerting System, Alert Ready, in Canada. This fluid approach enhances the credibility of warnings and reduces the risk of assumed false alarms by corroborating warning messages through multiple forms of media. The Common Alerting Protocol is a technical standard for this sort of multi-system integration.

Siren installations have many ways of being activated. Commonly used methods are dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF) or public switched telephone network (PSTN) using telephone lines, but activation can also be done via radio broadcast. This method opens up vulnerability for exploitation, but there are protections from false alarms. These sirens can also be tied into other networks such as a fire department&#x27;s volunteer notification/paging system. The basics of this type of installation would consist of a device (possibly the same pager the firefighters have) connected to the controller/timer system of the siren. When a page is received, the siren is activated.

== Types of sirens == 
===Mechanical sirens===

==== Basic design ====


A mechanical siren uses a rotor and stator to chop an air stream, which is forced through the siren by radial s in the spinning rotor. An example of this type of siren is the Federal Signal 2T22, which was originally developed during the Cold War and produced from the early 1950s to the late 1980s. This particular design employs dual rotors and stators to sound each pitch. Because the sound power output of this type of siren is the same in every direction at all times, it is described as omnidirectional. The Federal 2T22 was also marketed in a three-signal configuration known as the Federal Signal 3T22, with the capability for a &quot;high–low&quot; signal.

While some mechanical sirens produce sound in all directions simultaneously, other designs produce sound in only one direction, while employing a rotator mechanism to turn the siren head through 360 degrees of rotation. One rare type of mechanical siren, the Federal Signal RSH-10 (&quot;Thunderbeam&quot;), does not rotate or produce equal sound output in all directions. It instead uses a slowly rotating angled disc below the siren which directs the siren&#x27;s output throughout 360 degrees.

==== Supercharged ====
A variation of the electromechanical siren is a &quot;supercharged&quot; siren. A supercharged siren uses a separate source, usually a supercharger-like blower, which forces air into the rotor assembly of the siren. This increases the air pressure in the rotor assembly, causing the sound output of the siren to increase heavily, which in return increases the sound range by a large amount. The blower is generally driven by an electric motor, but in rare cases it is driven by an engine. Federal Signal took advantage of this design and created their Thunderbolt Siren Series, utilizing Sutorbilt Roots Blowers of different varieties and outputs.

A very early model called the Thunderbolt 2000. The difference between the Thunderbolt 2000 and later editions is that its blower is driven by an Onan two cylinder gas engine. Another example of a siren that has a separate blower is the Alerting Communicators of America (ACA) Hurricane. One more example of a siren with a blower is the SoCal Edison Model 120, utilizing a Centrifugal Style Blower, built specifically for the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station. The SoCal Edison Model 120 is no longer standing out in public, as only one exists, and is owned privately.

==== Pneumatic ====
Another variation on the electromechanical siren is the pneumatic siren. Similar to supercharged sirens, pneumatic sirens also force air into the rotor assembly of the siren. However, these sirens use a pressurized air reservoir instead of a motor-driven blower. (HLS), first produced by the German firm Pintsch-Bamag and later by the German firm Hörmann. Soon afterward, Hörmann improved on the design to create the HLS 273, which did away with the massive siren head of the original in favor of a more compact head and cast aluminum exponential-profile horns. These sirens stored a reservoir of compressed air, recharged periodically by a diesel engine-driven compressor in a vault in the base of the massive siren unit. The later HLS 273 placed the large (6,000 liter) air tank underground beside the machinery vault, instead of in the mast itself as in the earlier HLS units.

===Electronic sirens===
Electronic sirens consist of an electronic tone generator, a high-power amplifier, and a horn loudspeaker. Typically, the loudspeaker unit incorporates horn loading, causing them to be similar in appearance to some electromechanical sirens. Many of these loudspeakers incorporate a vertical array of horns to achieve pattern control in the vertical plane. Each cell of the loudspeaker horn is driven by one or more compression drivers. One type of compression driver for this type of loudspeaker uses two doughnut-shaped permanent magnet slugs to provide magnetic flux. For siren applications, high-fidelity sound is a secondary concern to high output, and siren drivers typically produce large amounts of distortion which would not be tolerable in an audio system where fidelity is important. Most newer (and some older) electronic sirens have the ability to store digital audio files. These audio files could be custom sounds, or emergency messages. Depending on the situation, the stored sound file can broadcast through the siren. These sirens could also come with a Microphone Jack to broadcast live messages via microphone.

As with electromechanical sirens, there are both omnidirectional, directional, and rotating categories. Whelen Engineering produces sirens which oscillate through 360 degrees, rotating in one direction and then in the other to allow a hard-wired connection between the amplifiers and the siren drivers. These sirens can also be set to rotate any amount from 0 to 360 degrees, allowing sirens to broadcast only in certain directions.

Electronic sirens may be mechanically rotated to cover a wide area, or may have transducers facing in all directions to make an omnidirectional pattern. A directional siren may be applied where notification is only required for a defined area in one direction.

==Civil defense sirens around the world==
===Middle East===

====Iran, Kuwait, and Iraq====
Kuwait has an entire siren system of Federal Signal Modulators. They once had an entire system of Thunderbolt system 7000&#x27;s, until they all got replaced. However, one System 7000 remains on display.

====Israel====
Israel has more than 3,100 warning sirens. Most of the sirens in urban areas are German-made HLS sirens, models F71 and ECN3000. All the other sirens are HPSS32 models made by Acoustic Technologies (ATI). During the early 2010s, mechanical sirens were gradually phased out and replaced by electronic ones, although the mechanical ones were generally left standing. The air-raid sirens are called , &#x27;alarm&#x27;, and consist of a continuous ascending and descending tone. The &quot;all clear&quot; signal, called , is a constant single-pitch sound. In recent conflicts, use of the &quot;all clear&quot; signal has been discontinued, as it was seen as causing unnecessary confusion and alarm. In certain regions in the south of Israel, which regularly undergo rocket attacks from Gaza, a specialized system called Red Color is used.

There is an earthquake warning system in Israel, which uses the sirens, called ().

The &quot;all clear&quot; signal is used three times per year to denote a moment of silence (of one or two minutes): once on Israel&#x27;s Holocaust Remembrance Day and twice on the Day of Remembrance.

====Saudi Arabia====
Most minaret speakers are used as sirens. The purpose of warnings is to notify the population of a danger that threatens their lives. Individuals must go to shelters or their homes, lock doors and windows, take appropriate protective actions, and listen through the radio and television for instructions of civil defense. The entire siren system is ASC I-Force and Whelen WPS-2900 series. As well as some Federal Signal Modulators in Air Force Bases, and a FS EOWS 1212 in Dammam.

====Türkiye====
Türkiye has Nationwide Siren System of Mechanical Sirens and Loudspeakers, though minaret speakers also are used as sirens sometimes. Models for mechanical sirens used across country are Selay SL-1170&#x27;s, Even though the main models of the warning speakers are unknown, there is a slightly common presence of Federal Signal, Whelen and Hörmann, Sonnenburg, despite very rare cases of some Elektror or Siemens-Schuckert models remaining. They sound-off during the memorial of Atatürk&#x27;s death on November 10 at 9:05 AM and often sound off for common emergencies such as Earthquakes, Tsunamis, Tornadoes, Chemical plant issues or incoming enemy attack. Sirens are controlled by AFAD. Sirens can also be mounted on roofs, or sometimes on 30m long Towers.

====United Arab Emirates====
The United Arab Emirates uses an integrated national Early Warning System (EWS) which was developed in 2017 and utilizes a network of cell broadcast, variable-message signs on roads, radio alerts, television alerts, and loudspeakers in mosque minarets as sirens. The warning system is managed by the National Emergency Crisis and Disaster Management Authority (NCEMA) and is used to warn the public during times of an emergency or a disaster.

===Asia===

====The People&#x27;s Republic of China====
China has sirens located in most cities and towns, particularly those located in or near disputed territories. If the state declares a state of emergency due to attacks or invasion, or when there is a very high risk of military conflict, sirens will warn the public of possible attacks or invasion. The sirens are controlled by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army.

There are annual or semi-annual test runs, often occurring on commemorative dates that are associated with the Second Sino-Japanese War. For example, Nanjing annually tests air raid sirens at 10 a.m. on 13 December, followed by a moment of silence to commemorate the Nanking Massacre. There have also been some commemorative tests during the memorial periods of major disasters, such as on 19 May 2008 in memory of victims of the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake.
The air raid warning comes in three types:
*Pre-raid warning: a 36-second high tone followed by a 24-second low tone, with three cycles per period. This warning signifies an air raid is likely about to take place.
*Raid warning: a six-second high-tone followed by a six-second low tone, with 15 cycles per period. This signifies that an air raid is imminent.
*Post-raid warning: a single three-minute high tone. When sounded, it signifies an end to the raid or a cool-down of the wartime situation.

====Taiwan====

Taiwanese civil defense sirens are erected on police stations and commanded by the nation&#x27;s Civil Defense Office (). The government issues air raid warnings, as well as tsunami warnings, through the sirens in conjunction with their own Public Warning System that utilizes 4G LTE cell signals. The Taiwanese government also holds annual air-raid drills called Wan-an drills () so the populace can be familiar with what to do in an air raid, given the high risk of war with neighboring mainland China.

====India====
Mumbai has around 200–250 functional sirens. The government is planning to change the system by incorporating modern wireless and digital technology in place of the present landline switching system.

In Mumbai civil defence, sirens were used during the Indo-Pakistan wars of 1965 and 1971, warning civilians about air raids by the Pakistan Air Force. At night, sirens were also used to indicate blackouts, when all lights in Mumbai were switched off. Daily tests of the sirens at 9 a.m. were recently reduced to once per month. They are controlled by the Regional Civil Defence Control Center, Mumbai, with input from Indian Defence Services. Sirens are also used to denote a minute&#x27;s worth of silence on special occasions.

====Japan====
Japan utilizes a system of mainly electronic &quot;Bosai Musen&quot; electronic sirens to warn of impending missile strikes or natural disasters such as Tsunamis. The system was installed by J-Alert in 2007 as one of their many other methods of warning the public of incoming dangers.

Some of these sirens are also used to play music at certain times of day, presumably as an &quot;end of day&quot; signal.

Japan also had a large mechanical siren system not used to warn residents, made by Yamaha, called the &quot;Yamaha Music Siren&quot;, sounded at certain times of day presumably as an &quot;end of day&quot; signal. These sirens had many mechanical choppers with different port ratios to match a certain musical note. These choppers would have rotating stators in order to let each note play individually, in order to play music.

====Singapore====
Singapore currently has a network of 284 stationary sirens named the Public Warning System which warns the entire country of air raids, as well as human-made and natural disasters (except earth tremors). Singapore&#x27;s sirens are tested at noon on the first day of every month. During the test, the sirens sound a light cheerful chime instead of any of the three signals. The sirens look very similar to the Hörmann ECN3000 (See picture).

====South Korea====
Nearly all towns and cities are equipped with civil defense sirens in case of natural disasters or missile attacks from North Korea. South Korea holds civil defense drills every month to prepare for such scenarios.

===Europe===

====Austria====
Austria is fully covered with an operational air-raid siren system consisting of 8,203 devices as of 2012. They are tested weekly at noon on Saturdays (except in Vienna) with the signal, a 15-second continuous tone. Every year on the first Saturday of October, the whole range of alarm signals (with the exception of the fire alert) is sounded as a system test () and to familiarize the population with the signals.
* Warning: a three-minute continuous tone. People are warned of an incoming danger and advised to tune into the appropriate Ö2 regional radio station or ORF 2 for further instructions.
* General alarm: a one-minute ascending and descending tone. Danger is imminent; people should seek shelter immediately and listen to radio or TV.
* End of danger: a one-minute continuous tone. The danger is over, and shelters can be left. Any hazards potentially encountered during normal life are announced in the media.
* Fire alert: three 15-second continuous tones separated by seven-second intervals. All firemen of volunteer fire brigades should report to their fire station immediately. This signal is being used less and less, as many fire brigades have begun to alert their members by radio.

====Belgium====
Belgium used to test its air raid sirens every first Thursday of the trimester (three-month period). Sirens are Sonnenburg Electronic sirens. When the air-raid sirens are tested, the message or is broadcast every time the sirens sound. There are 540 sirens all across the country. A non-audible test was performed every day, and the last test occurred on 4 October 2018. Afterwards, the network was decommissioned. The sirens remain around nuclear facilities, but no tests are performed. The official recommendation is that people subscribe to BE-Alert, a system where information is provided via SMS, e-mail or phone.

====Bulgaria====
Bulgaria has over 4000 sirens deployed around in the country, especially Sofia. These are likely used to warn people of earthquakes . Sirens were first installed during WW2 to warn people of incoming attacks by Nazi Germany; these were replaced by electronic ones during the 1990s. The sirens are tested on the first workday of April and November every year to see if they are functioning properly. On 2 June every year, the day of Hristo Botev and demised ones for the liberation and independence of Bulgaria is commemorated with a two-minute signal, different from the usual tone. The public is informed about the test beforehand. The sirens are mainly electronic ones (German made type ECN units or other high powered speaker systems on top of public buildings). The signals may includeattack (a one-minute wailing tone used to indicate an incoming danger) and alert (sometimes referred to as the &quot;all clear&quot; signal which is a continuous single tone). Strong tremors in Bulgaria are quite rare, so a special earthquake warning system is not needed.

====Czech Republic====
The Czech Republic has around 6,000 sirens. Within these 6,000 sirens which include mechanical sirens and electronic sirens, are tested every first Wednesday of the month. There are three warning signals, which are accompanied by a verbal message in Czech and usually with an English and German translation on electronic sirens. There is also an emergency broadcast on TV channels, maintained by Czech Television, and radio channels, maintained by Czech Radio.

* General alert: a 140-second long fluctuating tone. The alert can be repeated up to three times in three-minute intervals with four possible verbal messages:
** The danger is unspecified and people should go inside a building, close the doors and windows (the alert usually means a dangerous element may be present in the air), and turn the TV or radio to an appropriate channel to find out more;
** A flooding alert. (Siren signals for Flooding alert is not used anymore). The required action is that people should turn on the radio and get away from the source of danger (usually a river);
** There was a chemical accident. People should behave the same way as during an message;
** There was a radioactive accident. People should behave the same way as during an message.
* Testing of sirens: a 140-seconds long still tone, used to test the functionality of the sirens. is the verbal message before the test, and is the verbal message after the test.
* Fire alert: a one-minute long still tone with a pause. It is used to alert firefighters of a fire, accompanied by this verbal message: 

====Denmark====
There are 1,078 electronic warning sirens have been installed in Denmark by HSS Engineering and were actually license built Whelen WPS 2800 sirens. The sirens are placed on the tops of buildings or on masts. This warning system makes it possible to warn the populations of all urban areas with more than 1,000 inhabitants. This means that about 80% of Denmark&#x27;s population can be warned using stationary sirens. The remaining 20% are warned by mobile sirens mounted on police cars. The function of the sirens is tested every night, but does not produce any sound. Once every year, on the first Wednesday of May at 12:00, the sirens are tested with sound.

====Finland====
A general alarm consists of a repeating one-minute sound, made up of tones that ascend for seven seconds and descend for seven seconds. The end of danger is signaled by a one-minute continuous tone. Warning sirens are tested on the first Monday of every month at noon. The testing alarm is shorter than the general alarm (only lasting for seven or fourteen seconds) and may be a flat tone. The system commonly uses Teho-Ulvo sirens, which are electronic and are powered by horn loudspeaker arrays. They are known for their very distinctive wind-ups and wind-downs.

====France====
In France, the emergency population warning network is called the (&quot;RNA&quot;). The system is inherited from the air raid siren network () developed before World WarII. It consists of about 4,500 electronic or electromechanical sirens placed all over France. The system is tested each month at noon on the first Wednesday. The most common siren type is the electromechanical KM Europ eight-port single-tone siren. These sirens have a very characteristic sound: a very fast wind-up and a lower pitch than most sirens (the pitch is comparable to a Federal Signal STL-10 on a lower frequency). A recording of these sirens was used in the movie &quot;Silent Hill&quot;.
====Germany====
In Germany, the (&#x27;warning authorities&#x27;) were closed in the 1990s after the threat of the Cold War was over, since the ability to alert the public was then considered unnecessary. As the civil defense sirens were also frequently used to alert volunteer firefighters, many sirens were sold to municipalities for a symbolic price; others were dismantled. In the 2000s, it was realized that the ability to warn the public is not only necessary in cases of war, but also in events like natural disasters, chemical or nuclear accidents, or terrorist attacks. As a result, some cities like Düsseldorf and Dresden began to rebuild their warning sirens. In Hamburg, the sirens are still operational. They also warn the public during storm surges; for instance, all towns in the Moselle Valley continue to operate and test their warning sirens. The majority of operational sirens in Germany are either electric-mechanical type E57 or electronic sirens.

There are no precise official numbers as to how many sirens there used to be, as most of the documents regarding the system&#x27;s construction and upkeep have been disposed of after the Cold War ended. However, estimates place the number of operational sirens during the system&#x27;s peak at around 80,000 in West Germany alone. Accounts as to how many of those sirens are still in operation vary significantly depending on the source. The most prominent German company regarding manufacturing and maintenance of sirens, Hörmann Industries, states on its website that they are in charge of maintaining over 60,000 sirens. Granted, that includes mobile sirens that can be mounted on vehicles, but one can deduct from this information that there could be at least around 50,000 stationary sirens still in operation today, many of the once electro-mechanical sirens having been replaced with newer electronic models.

During World WarII, Berlin&#x27;s air raid sirens became known by the city&#x27;s residents as &quot;Meier&#x27;s trumpets&quot; or &quot;Meier&#x27;s hunting horns&quot; due to Luftwaffe chief Hermann Goering&#x27;s boast that &quot;If a single bomb ever falls on Berlin, you can call me Meier!&quot;.

====Hungary ====

The installation of sirens across the country was requested by the Minister of National Defense in 1938. Various models from several companies were used, and some were manufactured locally in Hungary under license from the companies owning the designs. The FM Si 41 model originates from Germany, the TESLA/Braun-Bovery siren originates from a Swiss company, and the EKA series and DINAMO sirens were manufactured locally in Hungary.

There were 25 air raid warning zones in Hungary. Only the larger towns and cities were afforded electric sirens, the rest of the country used hand-crank sirens, in addition to warnings broadcast by radio. The electric sirens were controlled via phone lines and were operated from a central location, such as a city hall, fire station, post office, or local military base or outpost.

Initially, there were only two siren signals, similar to the signals used in Britain at the time: &quot;Red Alert&quot;, or &quot;Air Raid Warning&quot; signal, indicating an imminent threat, and &quot;All Clear&quot;, indicating the danger had passed.

In 1944, the signal system was updated to four total signals:

# &quot;Air Warning&quot;30 seconds of continuous siren sounding. Used when enemy combatants entered within 150 km of the area
# &quot;Red Alert&quot;, &quot;Air Raid Warning&quot;issued when enemy combatants were estimated to arrive within 15 minutes
# &quot;Air Warning Over&quot;issued when enemy combatants were leaving the immediate area and the attack was considered over
# &quot;All Clear&quot;issued when the enemy combatants moved back past the 150km range

After the conclusion of World War II siren installation continued throughout the country. Previously unfurnished towns were equipped with the same type of sirens that were installed during the war, as those models were still kept in production. In the 1960s, after allying with the Soviet Union, Hungary planned to replace the aging siren systems installed during the war with sirens that were produced in other communist countries like Czechoslovakia and East Germany. In the early 1970s, a massive siren replacement program began. Nearly all sirens were replaced with the DDR DS977 and MEZ models. Some of the siren models that were used during the war were still in production, so some areas did receive &quot;WW2-Type&quot; sirens.

The sirens installed during the 70s were and remain as property of the National Civil Defense. These more modern installations weren&#x27;t controlled via telephone lines, but by sound-activated receivers. Each installation had a remote control unit at the local police station, fire station or Civil Defense Office that would transmit the specific frequencies that would activate the sirens in the surrounding areas. Testing and maintaining this system was problematic, as the remote control unit was not allowed to be used to run tests and only to be operated in legitimate use cases of war or emergency. Civil Defense workers had to manually go to and test each individual siren in the system that was registered to their station. With only a few Civil Defense stations per county, any given station would be responsible for several cities, towns and villages, making maintenance take significant amounts of time. A rare few of these Cold-War–era siren systems were equipped with phone line control systems, these were mostly located around nuclear shelters.

In the late 1990s, the remote control system was deemed unstable and unreliable. With the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the likelihood of war was low, and the National Warning System was abandoned.

In the mid 2000s, the MoLaRi System was built around factories that work with hazardous materials, to warn surrounding areas in case of emergency or risk to public health or safety. These systems continue to be installed near facilities that work with hazardous materials.

In 2011, a National Civil Defense Drill was held to see how many of the sirens abandoned for decades still functioned. Many of them did not work, and while some counties decided to repair the sirens and start doing yearly growl tests again, others decided to leave the abandoned systems as they were. A few cities and counties kept their sirens active and in good condition, and still perform repairs, maintenance, and yearly tests, like Győr-Moson-Sopron county, Heves county, Hajdú-Bihar county, and Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok county.

In 2014 regular testing of the MoLaRi sirens near hazardous materials facilities began, testing is performed on the first Monday of each month at 11:00, this is most easily heard in and around Budapest, where a large number of these facilities are located

The remaining siren systems that were found to be non-functional have been dismantled or left in place. Emergency Plan documents for some towns still state that citizens will be warned with the use of sirens, despite these systems being defunct.

The government has attempted to destroy all old siren systems that were dismantled, out of fear that intact systems could be activated and cause panic. The Civil Defense Office currently relies on radio, TV, and phone alerts to warn the population in case of emergency, and in some emergency plans, church bells are included as a potential warning system.

There are four current siren signals, used by the MoLaRi system, HÖRMANN sirens, and on the old siren systems where they are still maintained:

# &quot;Air-Raid Alert&quot;a 30-second continuous sounding with pitch alternating between 280Hz and 400Hz, repeated three times, with 30-second pauses between soundings
# &quot;Emergency Alarm&quot;a 120-second continuous sounding with pitch alternating between 133Hz and 400Hz
# &quot;All Clear&quot; a 30-second continuous sounding with a constant pitch of 400Hz, repeated twice, with 30-second pauses between the signals
# &quot;Test Alarm&quot;a six-second sounding ramping up to 400Hz over the duration

====Italy====
The Italian War Ministry began installing air raid sirens and issuing air defence regulations in 1938. Production was entrusted to La Sonora, founded in 1911 and still active today.

During World WarII, every town had a siren, and several were present in each large city. Even after the danger of bombings had ended, they were kept to provide warning in case of any threat (e.g. high water in Venice).

As of 2015, some of them still survive. For instance, as many as 34 have been located in Rome using crowdsourcing. Up until the 1980s, they underwent routine maintenance and sounded at noon.

Additionally, the Protezione Civile (Civil Protection) operates sirens to warn the public in case of a threat to the citizen population. Protezione Civile also provides transport needs and military defence for the Government of Italy. These defence systems were put in place in the 1990s and are occasionally still used today.

Urbania, Italy has a British Secomak GP3 air raid siren which is annually activated in honor of the Bombing in Urbania, which took place during World War II. 

Ferrara, Italy has a system of Whelen (remodeled HSS-TWS series) sirens that warn of industrial risks in the area. 

====Lithuania====

Lithuania operates sirens from the Cold War mainly in suburban areas of big cities such as Vilnius, Klaipėda, Kaunas, Šiauliai, Panevėžys and or others. The most common models are Elektror, Siemens and Hörmann, even though Federal Signal is not too rare in these areas. These sirens can be found in fire stations, factories, police stations and city halls. The attack and all clear signal is used for tests even though tests aren&#x27;t as frequent as in other areas across Northern Europe. They soundnoff in case of fires, chemical issues, floods, incoming enemy attack, etc. Testing date for most areas is most likely yearly.

====Netherlands====

The Netherlands tests its air-raid sirens once per month, on the first Monday at noon, to keep the public aware of the system. There are about 4,200 sirens placed all across the country.
In March 2015 it was announced that, due to high maintenance costs, the sirens will be taken out of service by the end of 2020. The government has implemented a Cell Broadcast system called NL-Alert, compliant to the mandatory European regulation EU-Alert, to replace the sirens by 2021. However, as of early 2022, the sirens will continue to be heard until another decision has been made.

====Norway====
Norway has about 1,250 operational sirens (mostly Kockums air horn units rather than motorized sirens), primarily located in cities. Three different signals are used:

* Critical message, listen to radio: three periods of three signals, separated by one minute between the periods. The &quot;critical message&quot; signal is followed by a radio broadcast. It is used in peacetime to warn the population about major accidents, large fires and gas leaks.
* Air raid, take cover: an intermittent signal lasting for about a minute. 
* All clear: a continuous signal sounded for about 30 seconds. 
The sirens are tested twice each year, at noon on the second Wednesday of January and June. As of 2014, only the &quot;critical message&quot; signal is used during tests. Previously, the signal tested in June would use the &quot;air raid&quot; and &quot;all clear&quot; signals. The latter two are no longer used in peacetime.

There are also sirens in the Storfjorden area in Møre og Romsdal county to warn about an avalanche from the mountain Åkerneset. These sirens are not operated by Norwegian Civil Defense department; instead, they are operated by Åksnes/Tafjord Beredskap. These sirens can be found in the villages of Stranda, Tafjord, Geiranger, Hellesylt, Linge, and Valldal.

====Poland====

There are numerous civil defense sirens employed throughout Poland. Though the testing schedule is unclear, sirens are commonly sounded on the anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising. As in other parts of the world, many of the country&#x27;s volunteer fire stations utilize civil defense sirens for fire calls. Many of these stations will use a two siren set-up; one unit being high pitched, the other being low pitched. 
====Portugal====

Portugal has hundreds of sirens placed across the country. Urban areas most likely use a few electronic sirens even though the presence of warning sirens is more common in suburban or rural areas, where fire stations use them for fire calls. These kinds of sirens are dual-tone and mechanical and are the most common kind of warning siren in Portugal. Between the 2000s and the early 2010s, a few fire sirens were decommissioned due to maintenance upkeep even though most of them remain active.

====Romania====
In Romania, civil defense sirens have been used since the early 1930s. Originally, each street had a small siren on top of a high-rise building, which could be powered mechanically. During World WarII, the sirens had a single continuous tone to warn of an air strike.

Throughout the Cold War, larger sirens were manufactured locally and installed on various public buildings and residences. The sirens were able to transmit a comprehensive variety of tones, each with a different meaning such as a chemical disaster, an earthquake, a flood, or an imminent air or nuclear strike; each of these tones required the population to either move to higher ground or an ABC shelter. An &quot;all clear&quot; signal was played after the area had been deemed safe for the general public.

Since the 1990s, civil defense sirens have been replaced by electronic sirens and the procedure has been simplified. As of 2013, there are four playable tones: a natural disaster warning, an upcoming air/nuclear strike, an imminent air/nuclear strike, and an &quot;all clear&quot; signal. Taking shelter is no longer a legal requirement, although ABC shelters are still operational.

In August 2017, Romanian authorities started to perform monthly defence siren tests. The first such test took place on 2 August 2017 and is scheduled to be repeated on the first Wednesday of each month, between 10:00 and 11:00am local time. Such tests have been stopped in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

====Russia====
During the siege of Leningrad, the radio network carried information for the population about raids and air alerts. The famous &quot;metronome&quot; went down in the history of the siege of Leningrad as a cultural monument of resistance of the population.

At that time, there were more than a thousand loudspeakers and four hundred thousand radio streams operating in the city. If there were no broadcast programs, then the metronome was broadcast with a slow rhythm of 50–55 beats per minute. The network was switched on around the clock, which allowed the population and services to be confident in the operation of the network. By order of the MPVO headquarters, the duty officer of the Central station of the radio network interrupted the broadcast of the program, turned on an electric player with a record of the alarm text. This record was supplemented by 400 electric sirens. At the end of the recording, the metronome was switched on with a rapid rhythm of 160–180 beats per minute. When the danger was over, the electric player was switched on again by order of the staff, and the alarm was sounded in the streets and houses, accompanied by the sound of fanfares.

====Slovenia====
Slovenia has 1,563 operable civil defence sirens. Most of them are electronic sirens, although there are some mechanical ones. Civil defence sirens are mounted on fire stations, town halls, or other structures.

Three siren tones are used in the country:

* Warning (&quot;Opozorilo na nevarnost&quot;): two-minute–long steady tone. Serves as a warning of the impending danger of a fire, natural or other type of disaster, or high water level.
* Immediate danger (&quot;Neposredna nevarnost&quot;): one-minute wailing tone. Used in case of dangers, such as major fires, floods, radiological or chemical danger and air raid.
* All clearend of danger (&quot;Konec nevarnosti&quot;): thirty-second steady tone. It is heard during tests of air raid sirens each month on the first Saturday of each month at noon, and at the end of an emergency for which the immediate danger signal was sounded.

Since 1 September 1998, there are two additional siren tones, which are used in certain Slovenian municipalities. The municipalities of Hrastnik and Trbovlje use a special signal (called &quot;Neposredna nevarnost nesreče s klorom&quot;) for the immediate danger in case of an accident involving chlorine when there is a danger of chlorine leaks in the environment. The 100-second-long signal consists of a 30-second wailing tone immediately followed by a 40-second steady tone and again of a 30-second wailing tone. The municipalities of Muta, Vuzenica, Podvelka, Radlje ob Dravi, Brežice, Krško and Sevnica use a 100-second-long wailing signal (named &quot;Neposredna nevarnost poplavnega vala&quot;) (consisting of four-second bursts separated by four seconds of silence) for the immediate danger of flash floods, used in case of overflow or collapse of a hydroelectric dam.

When emergencies impact multiple regions at the same time, or the whole country, people are advised to listen to the first channel of the public Radio Slovenia, Val 202, or watch the first or second channel of the public broadcaster RTV Slovenija. Emergencies of smaller extent are announced via regional radio and TV stations.

Until 1 January 1998, air-raid sirens were tested each Saturday at noon. The formerly used warning signals were:

* General public mobilisation (&quot;Splošna javna mobilizacija&quot;): three-minute long ascending and descending tone, consisting of alternating ten-second bursts and five seconds of silence
* Immediate danger of air raid (&quot;Zračna nevarnost&quot;): one-minute wailing tone
* ABC (chemical, biological, nuclear disaster) alarm (&quot;Radiacijsko-biološko-kemična nevarnost&quot;): 90-second tone, consisting of three twenty-second ascending and descending bursts, separated by fifteen seconds of silence
* Fire alarm (&quot;Požarna nevarnost&quot;): 90-second tone, consisting of three 20-second steady bursts, separated by fifteen seconds of silence
* (Natural) disaster (&quot;Nevarnost naravnih nesreč&quot;): 60-second signal with alternating 20 seconds of steady tone, 20 seconds of ascending and descending tone and another 20-second wailing tone
* All clear (&quot;Konec nevarnosti&quot;): 60-second steady tone

====Spain====
Few sirens that were used for civil defence against bombings during the Spanish Civil War are preserved. The Guernica siren has a highly symbolic value because of the impact of the Bombing of Guernica. Barcelona City History Museum preserves one related to the Bombing of Barcelona, and another siren from civil war years is also preserved in Valencia.

====Sweden====
The Swedish alarm system uses outdoor sirens in addition to information transmitted through radio and television and sent by text messages and mobile apps. Special radio receivers are handed out to residents living near nuclear power plants. The outdoor system , also known as (&#x27;Hoarse Fredrik&#x27;, alluding to the sound of the siren) to the Swedish population, consists of 4,600 sirens. These sirens were first tested in 1931, and were mounted to cars and bikes sent out by the government. The sirens can be found on tall buildings all around Sweden. They are driven by compressed air in giant tanks, but are successively being replaced by modern electronic sirens which use speakers. The emergency services are also able to send out spoken messages through the new sirens. The outdoor signals used are as follows:

* Readiness alarm (): a five-minute pattern of 30-second tones separated by 15-second gaps. Used when an imminent danger of war is present.
* Air raid alarm (): a one-minute pattern of two-second tones separated by two-second gaps. Sent when the threat of an air attack is imminent.
* Important public announcement, general alarm (): a pattern of seven-second-long tones and fourteen-second-long gaps. People should go inside, close windows and doors, close ventilation, and listen to radio channel P4. Information may also be given via television and text-television.
* All clear (): a 30-second-long single tone. Used for all above signals when danger is over.

The outdoor sirens are tested four times a year on the first non-holiday Monday of March, June, September, and December at 15:00 local time. The test consists of the general alarm for two minutes, followed by a 90-second gap before the &quot;all clear&quot; is sounded.

There are usually around 15 to 20 general alarms, occurring locally, per year. The most common cause of general alarms is fire, specially in situations that involve industries, landfills, and other facilities containing dangerous substances which can create hazardous smoke. The 2018 peak in alarms (54 that year) is attributed to the 2018 Sweden wildfires which alone caused over 20 general alarms. Other possible attributing factors could be the increased public safety awareness after the 2017 Stockholm truck attack.

====Switzerland====
Switzerland currently has 8,500 mobile and stationary civil defense sirens, which can alert 99% of the population. There are also 700 sirens located near dams. Every year on the first Wednesday of February, Switzerland&#x27;s sirens are tested to see if they are functioning properly. During this test, general alert sirens as well as sirens near dams are checked. The population is informed of the test in the days leading up to the tests by radio, television, teletext, and newspapers, and the siren tests do not require the population to take any special measures.

The tones of the different sirens are provided on the last page of all phone books as well as on the Internet.

* General alert: a one-minute regularly ascending and descending tone, followed by a two-minute interval of silence before repeating. The &#x27;general alert&#x27; siren goes off when there is a possible threat to the population. The population is instructed to inform those around them to proceed inside. Once inside, people are instructed to listen to emergency broadcasts made by the broadcasting networks SRF, RTS, RSI and RSR.
* Flood alert: 12 continuous low-pitched tones, each lasting 20 seconds. The flood alert is activated once the general siren is sounding. If heard by the population in danger zones (such as near dams), they must leave the dangerous area immediately or find shelter.

====Ukraine====

Ukraine has employed civil defense sirens to warn citizens of danger during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The observed use of sirens in Ukraine has been the following:
*Danger threat: Repeated long bursts
*All Clear: Final Short burst

====United Kingdom====
During World WarII, Britain had two warning tones:

* Red warning: attack in progress or imminent (attack/wail)
* All clear: attack over (steady alert)

These tones would be initiated by the Royal Observer Corps after spotting Luftwaffe aircraft coming toward Britain, with the help of coastal radar stations. The &quot;red warning&quot; would be sounded when the Royal Observer Corps spotted enemy aircraft in the immediate area. The sirens were tested periodically by emitting the tones in reverse order, with the &quot;all clear&quot; tone followed by the &quot;red warning&quot; tone. This ensured the public would not confuse a test with a real warning.

Every village, town, and city in the United Kingdom used to have a network of dual-tone sirens to warn of incoming air raids during World WarII. The operation of the sirens was coordinated by a wire broadcast system via police stations. In towns and cities with a population of over 3,000, powered sirens were used, whereas in rural areas hand-operated sirens were used (which were later put to use as warnings for nuclear attack during the Cold War). At the end of the Cold War in 1992, the siren network was decommissioned, and very few remain. These sirens, mostly built by Carter, Gents, Castle Castings, and Secomak (now Klaxon Signal Co.), have 10 and 12 ports to create a minor third interval (B and D notes) and are probably the world&#x27;s most recognised World WarII air raid siren sound. Recordings of British sirens are often dubbed into movies set in countries which never used this type of siren.

Around 1,200 sirens remain, mostly used to warn the public of severe flooding. They are also used for public warning near gas or nuclear power plants, nuclear submarine bases, oil refineries and chemical plants. The remaining sirens are a mix of older motor driven models (usually from World WarII), such as the Carter siren manufactured by Carter&#x27;s of Nelson or the &quot;syren&quot; manufactured by Gent&#x27;s of Leicester, and Cold War like Castle Castings and Secomak (now Klaxon Signal Co.) and newer electronic sirens like Hormann ECN, Whelen, Federal Signal Modulator, ATI HPSS and COOPER WAVES. Most of them usually tested annually between August and September if they&#x27;re not in a siren system. They are also used to start and finish silences on Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday
There was a siren system consisted mainly of Castle Castings and two Secomak GP3s for their flood warning system sector. When MoD was decommissioning these systems across the country, Norfolk kept their sector back for flood warning. With the advent of digital services and mobile technology, many local authorities are now retiring their siren networks in favour of contacting people by telephone. In January 2007, proposals to retire a network of sirens in Norfolk were made by the Norfolk Resilience Forum. In November 2007, residents were angered after the sirens had not sounded following a tidal surge in Walcott. In 2008, a review of the current and future role of flood warning sirens was undertaken by Norfolk County Council, after plans to retire them were halted following concerns from nearby residents. Although some of the sirens were initially withdrawn, 40 out of the 57 were eventually temporarily reinstated. Despite this, in July 2010 the flood warning sirens were finally retired in favour of alerting people by telephone, SMS or e-mail. After three years of consultations, the council had failed to demonstrate that refurbishing the sirens would be a worthwhile investment. The whole siren system was completely gone by late 2013, with only two sirens remaining, which are both inactive with one of them refurbished and put on display on a beach not far from its original location, and another, in Mundesley Fire Station, just standing there, extremely unlikely to ever sound again.
Lincolnshire, which had one of the largest siren systems in the country consisting of Carters, had 46 sirens based in North Somercotes, Mablethorpe, Boston, Skegness, Spalding and Sutton Bridge, as well as inland at Louth, Horncastle, Middle Rasen and Gainsborough, the areas most at risk of being hit by floods. Following serious flooding in the summer of 2007, investigations took place into how the flood warning system could be improved. The Environment Agency admitted that the warning system in Louth had not sounded early enough. In April 2008, Lincolnshire County Council began to investigate the possibility of replacing the flood warning sirens with mobile phone alerts. A council report in November 2009 described the sirens as being &quot;outdated, in the wrong places and difficult to repair&quot;. The sirens were eventually decommissioned in November 2011 and replaced with Floodline.

In January 2010, 13 public warning sirens on the island of Guernsey that had first been installed in 1937 were due to be retired and replaced by text messages. This followed claims by the Home Department that the sirens had &quot;reached the end of their useful working life&quot;. The sirens had previously been used to warn of major incidents. From 1950 to 2010, the Civil Defence Committee took responsibility for the sirens, and had tested them annually since 9 May 1979. Members of the public had criticised the decision, and Deputy Janine Le Sauvage claimed that sirens were the only way everyone knew there was an emergency. In February 2010, 40 islanders formed a protest march opposing the proposal to retire the sirens. The campaigners accused the government of not listening to them, as an online petition calling for the sirens to be saved was signed by more than 2,000 people. In April 2010, it was decided to dismantle the public warning system. Emergency planners had proposed to use a new warning system that would contact residents by telephone; however, this was abandoned due to technical limitations and local media and other communication methods are used instead. Only two remain in Guernsey, one in Victoria Tower, which sounded off once at around 2017, and another, active for a quarry.

Following severe flooding in Upper Calder Valley in June 2000, the Environment Agency replaced its network of sirens, with eight being placed around Walsden, Todmorden, Hebden Bridge and Mytholmroyd. The network was designed to complement the agency&#x27;s Floodline service. These sirens became what is now known as the Todmorden Flood Warning System. There are nine sirens that are part of the system, five of them being Secomak, three of them being Klaxon and one of them being Carter (which was recently confirmed to be inactive according to the local environment agency).

In November 2010, 36 flood warning sirens in Essex, including nine on Canvey, were retired following concerns from the county council that the system was &quot;no longer fit for purpose&quot;. The sirens were due to become obsolete in 2014. Only five sirens from the entire system remain, two of them in Canvey Island.

In September 2012, new flood warning sirens were installed in the Dunhills Estate in Leeds, as part of flood defence work at Wyke Beck. In January 2014, flood sirens sounded for the first time in 30 years on the Isle of Portland.

Broadmoor Hospital used 13 sirens installed in 1952, which were tested weekly. These were consisted of Secomak CS8s, which were similar to a Secomak GP8 except the CS8 had coded shutters which could do an alternating hi-lo signal, and if designed to do so, could also do a pulse signal. For emergencies, they sounded the hi-lo and for all clear, they sounded a steady tone. In tests, they would sound the all-clear. In July 2014, plans were put forward to retire seven of the thirteen alarms, which had last been properly activated in 1993. The alarms are located in areas such as Sandhurst, Wokingham, Bracknell, Camberley and Bagshot. In June 2016, the West London Mental Health Trust, who manages the hospital, proposed decommissioning the sirens altogether and replacing them with social media alerts through websites such as Twitter. In December 2019, this entire system was decommissioned, in favour of a new Electronic siren located at the hospital. This siren is tested silently, however on occasion (with prior notice from the hospital) it is audibly tested, but not at full volume.

A similar siren system in Carstairs, Scotland, called the Carstairs Hospital Siren System, uses nine sirens, seven of them being Secomak CS8, one being a Klaxon GP8 and one being Secomak GP12. The hi-lo signal is rarely used since during emergencies they sound a continuous tone for eight minutes, and in &quot;all clear&quot; they sound a long wail, consisting of thirty seconds of startup and alert and a thirty-second wind-down, three times. The test schedule is the third Thursday of every month at 1PM with the &quot;all clear&quot;.

There are several sirens in use around Avonmouth near Bristol to warn of chemical incidents from industry in the area. These are known as the Severnside Sirens. These sirens consist of Federal Signal Modulators and two DSAs, which were installed in 1997 for the public. The system is tested every third day of every month at 3PM. This consists of rising tones and a steady pulsing tone, followed by a steady tone for all clear. In emergencies, they will run for as long as the batteries can allow since they are off-grid powered.

===North America===

====Canada====
In Canada, a nationwide network of Canadian Line Materials sirens was established in the 1950s to warn urban populations of a possible Soviet nuclear attack. This system was tested nationwide twice in 1961, under the codenames &quot;Exercise Tocsin&quot; and &quot;Tocsin B&quot;. The system was maintained until the 1970s, when advancements in military technology reduced the Soviet nuclear missile strike time from 3–5 hours to less than 15 minutes. Sirens can still be found in many Canadian cities, all in various states of repair. In Toronto, for instance, the network has been abandoned to the point where no level of government will take responsibility for its ownership. A handful of sirens still remain in Toronto in older established neighbourhoods:

* Dundas Street West and Shaw Street 
* York Quay, Harbourfront

Sirens have recently been built within three kilometers (two miles) of the Darlington and Pickering nuclear power plants in the province of Ontario. (Both plants are within 30 kilometers; 20 miles of each other.) These sirens will sound in the event of a nuclear emergency that could result in a release of radioactivity. Sirens have also been placed (and are tested weekly) in Sarnia, Ontario due to the large number of chemical plants in the vicinity. These consist mainly of ATI HPSS32 sirens, as well as a Federal Signal Modulator in the rail yards and three Thunderbolt 1003s located at the Suncor plant.
Sirens have also been installed in and around the Grey Bruce Nuclear Generating Station. The sirens are on the plant and in the surrounding communities such as Tiverton, Ontario. One notable siren is a Federal Signal Modulator at the Bruce Nuclear Visitor&#x27;s Centre. The Public Siren network as it is called, consists of mostly Whelens, Modulators, and Model 2s. One of the sirens in this network (a Model 2) is at Tiverton, which is about 10 km (6 miles) from the plant.

Many warning sirens in Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta are now used as tornado warning instruments. Smithers, British Columbia uses an old air raid siren as a noon-day whistle. New Waterford, Nova Scotia uses a siren to signal the daily curfew. One of the warning sirens was even used as a goal horn for the Quebec Nordiques between the mid-1980s and 1991. Caledonia, Ontario routinely uses an air raid siren to call in their local volunteer firefighters to the fire hall. NOAA Weather Radios in Canada are often used for advance warnings about future severe storms whenever people are at home, at a business or in a car.

====United States====
In the United States, several sets of warning tones have been used that have varied due to age, government structure, and manufacturer. The initial alerts used during World WarII were the alert signal (a 3–5-minute steady, continuous siren tone) and the attack signal (a 3–5-minute warbling tone, or series of short tone bursts on devices incapable of warbling, such as whistles). The Victory Siren manual stated that when a manual generation of the warbling tone was required, it could be achieved by holding the &quot;Signal&quot; switch on for eight seconds and off for four seconds. In 1950, the Federal Civil Defense Administration revised the signals, naming the alert signal &quot;red alert&quot; and adding an &quot;all clear&quot; signal, characterized by three one-minute steady blasts with two minutes of silence between the blasts.

Beginning in 1952, the Bell and Lights Air Raid Warning System, developed by AT&amp;T, was made available to provide automated transmission of an expanded set of alert signals:

* Red alert: Attack imminent
* Yellow alert: Attack likely
* White alert: All clear
* Blue alert: High–low (Different warning, such as a local warning)

The &quot;yellow alert&quot; and &quot;red alert&quot; signals correspond to the earlier &quot;alert&quot; signal and &quot;attack&quot; signal, respectively, and the early Federal Signal AR timer siren control units featured the &quot;take cover&quot; button labeled with a red background and the &quot;alert&quot; button labeled with a yellow background. Later AF timers changed the color-coding, coloring the &quot;alert&quot; button blue, the &quot;take cover&quot; button yellow, and the &quot;fire&quot; button red (used to call out volunteer firefighters), thus confusing the color-coding of the alerts. In 1955, the Federal Civil Defense Administration again revised the warning signals, altering them to deal with concern over nuclear fallout. The new set of signals were the &quot;alert&quot; signal (unchanged) and the &quot;take cover&quot; signal (previously the &quot;attack&quot; signal). The &quot;all clear&quot; signal was removed because leaving a shelter while fallout was present would prove hazardous.

Sirens began to replace bells for municipal warning in the early 1900s, but became commonplace following America&#x27;s entry into World WarII. Most siren models of this time were single-tone models which often sounded almost an octave higher in pitch than their European counterparts. Dual-tone sirens became more common in the 1950s, but had been used in some areas since about 1915. During the Cold War, standard signals were used throughout the country for civil defense purposes, referred to as &quot;alert&quot; and &quot;attack&quot;. Volunteer fire departments generally used a different siren signal. Many towns, especially in California and New England, used coded air horns or diaphones for fire calls and reserved sirens for civil defense use.

Today, signals are determined by state and local authorities, and can vary from one region to another. The most common tones produced by sirens in the United States are &quot;alert&quot; (steady) and &quot;attack&quot; (wail). Other tones include Westminster Chimes (commonly used for the testing of electronic sirens), hi-lo (high-low), whoop, pulse (pulsing), air horn, and fast wail.

The U.S. federal standard regarding emergency warning signals is defined in FEMA&#x27;s Outdoor Warning Systems Guide, CPG 1–17, published on March 1, 1980, which describes the Civil Defense Warning System (CDWS) and its warning signals. The language was slightly revised by FEMA&#x27;s National Warning System Operations Manual, Manual 1550.2 published 03-30-2001:

* Attack warning: a three-to-five-minute wavering tone on sirens or a series of short blasts on horns or other devices. The &quot;attack warning&quot; signal means an actual attack or accidental missile launch was detected, and people should take protective action immediately. The signal will be repeated as often as deemed necessary by local government authorities to get the required response from the population, including taking protective action from the arrival of fallout. This signal will have no other meaning and will be used for no other purpose. (However, sometimes the &quot;attack&quot; signals are used for tornado warnings.)
* Attention or alert warning: a three-to-five-minute steady signal from sirens, horns, or other devices. Local government officials may authorize use of this signal to alert the public of peacetime emergencies, normally tornadoes, flash floods, and tsunamis. With the exception of any other meaning or requirement for action as determined by local governments, the &quot;attention&quot; or &quot;alert&quot; signal will indicate that all persons in the United States should &quot;turn on [their] radio or television and listen for essential emergency information&quot;.
* A third distinctive signal may be used for other purposes, such as a local fire signal.
* All clear: no all clear signal is defined by either document.
The most common tone, &quot;alert&quot;, is widely used by municipalities to warn citizens of impending severe weather, particularly tornadoes which have earmarked the sirens as &quot;tornado sirens&quot;. This practice is nearly universal in the Midwest and parts of the Deep South, where intense and fast-moving thunderstorms that can produce tornadoes occur frequently. The &quot;alert&quot; sound is a steady, continuous note. In seaside towns, &quot;alert&quot; may also be used to warn of a tsunami. Sirens that rotate will have a rising-and-falling tone as the direction of the horn changes. The &quot;attack&quot; tone is the rising and falling sound of an air raid or nuclear attack, frequently heard in war movies. It was once reserved for imminent enemy attack, but is today sometimes used to warn of severe weather, tsunamis, or even fire calls, depending on local ordinance. Criteria to sound sirens during severe weather events is established by regional National Weather Service offices and do not have an &quot;all clear&quot; signal.

There is no standard &quot;fire&quot; signal in the United States, and while the use of sirens by volunteer fire departments is still common, it is diminishing. In the dry areas of the American West, residents may be required to shut off outdoor water systems to ensure adequate pressure at fire hydrants upon hearing the signal. The &quot;fire&quot; signal can vary from one community to another. Three long blasts on a siren is one common signal, similar to the signal used by volunteer brigades in Germany and other countries, while other locales use the hi-lo (high-low) signal described above. Some communities, particularly in New England and northern California, make use of coded blasts over a diaphone or air horn for fire signals, reserving the use of sirens for more serious situations. Still others use the &quot;attack&quot; tone as their fire call. Some communities make use of an &quot;all clear&quot; signal, or sound separate signals for fire calls and ambulance runs. Some fire signals in the U.S. are often blasted at least once a day, mostly at noon, to test the system, and are often referred to as &quot;noon sirens&quot; or &quot;noon whistles&quot;. These also function as a time tick for setting clocks.

CPG 1-17 recommends that a monthly test be conducted, consisting of the steady &quot;attention&quot; signal for no more than one minute, one minute of silence, and the &quot;attack&quot; signal for no more than one minute. A &quot;growl test&quot; signal is also described by CPG 1–17, when a siren must be tested more than once a month. This is typically a one-second burst of sound to verify the proper operation of the siren without causing a significant number of people to interpret the test as an actual alert. Many cities in the U.S. periodically sound their sirens as a test, either weekly, monthly, or yearly, at a day and hour set by each individual city.

In the United States, there is no national level alert system. Normally, sirens are controlled on a county or local level, but some are controlled on a state level, such as in Hawaii. Sirens are usually used to warn of impending natural disaster; while they are also used to warn of threats of military attacks, these rarely occur in the United States. Throughout the Great Plains, Midwest, and South, they are typically used to warn the public to take cover when a tornado warning is issued, sometimes even for severe thunderstorm warnings, and very rarely used for anything else. They are generally required in areas within a ten-mile radius of nuclear power plants. In the South and on the East Coast (except for Texas, Maine, Florida and New Hampshire), sirens are used to inform people about approaching hurricanes.

In Pierce County, Washington there is a system of sirens set up along the Puyallup and Carbon River valleys to warn residents of volcanic eruptions and lahars (giant mudslides) from Mt. Rainier.

Coastal communities, especially those in northern California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii, use siren systems to warn of incoming tsunamis. In 2011, the city of Honolulu created an &quot;Adopt-a-Siren&quot; website for its tsunami sirens. The site is modeled after Code for America&#x27;s &quot;Adopt-a-Hydrant&quot;, which helps volunteers in Boston sign up to shovel out fire hydrants after storms.

Some U.S. volunteer fire departments, particularly in rural areas, use sirens to call volunteers to assemble at the firehouse. This method is being used less frequently as technology advances and local residents within earshot often file complaints with their town boards. Some areas utilize their sirens as a last resort, relying more on cellular and paging technology; however, a decreasing number of rural departments are still outside the range of wireless communications and rely on sirens to activate the local volunteer departments.

Many college campuses in the U.S., especially in the wake of the Virginia Tech shooting, have begun installing sirens to warn students in the event of dangerous incidents. Sirens in the United States have been replaced by NOAA Weather Radios for advance warnings about future severe storms whenever people are inside cars or buildings.

===South America===
Argentina

Around mainly suburban areas of big cities like Bahia Blanca, Mar De Plata, Rosario, Cordoba and Comodoro Rivadavia, in police stations, fire stations, factories, weather stations, city halls and amongst common public neighbourhoods, warning sirens can be found. Most of the common models are a special model which isn&#x27;t completely identified yet as of now, which however, looks like a vertical Klaxon GP6/10, a Mechtric MS22 or a vertically installed mechanical or electro-mechanical eight-, nine-, eleven-, or twelve-port single-tone siren, most of which have six rectangular horns and are most often identified as a Kingvox. They sound off for terrorism attacks, bushfires, dam leakages, chemical plant issues, life-threatening/extremely severe weather alerts which are certain to happen, incoming enemy attack and any other common natural disasters. Other models present in the country&#x27;s warning system include Federal Signal, Elektror/Siemens, Whelen, Telegrafia, Klaxon and Hörmann. In extremely urban areas like Buenos Aires, most of the mechanical sirens which used to operate in a large amount were decommissioned and replaced with a smaller amount of electronic sirens, SMS alerts to phones and in some cases, as EAS alerts to TV. In some areas around the suburban areas of the big cities, over the years and since the 2010s, some sirens were decommissioned due to maintenance upkeep even though most of them remain active.

Two signals are commonly used. Here are the signals:

* General warning: Thirteen-second wind-up and alert with a six-second wind-down, which repeats three times. This signal is used if a public emergency is imminent.
* All clear: A 100-second alert to be used after a public emergency has been dealt with.

The &quot;all clear&quot; signal is mainly used during the nationwide siren testing in Argentine Volunteer Firefighters&#x27; Day on 2 June, and sometimes, in some sirens, the general warning is tested after the all-clear.

====Australia====

A series of 98 electronic sirens, making up a large-scale public-address system (the Sydney CBD Emergency Warning System) and including thirteen variable-message signs, are installed in the Sydney central business district. While installed in the months preceding the 2007 APEC conference, they are designed to be a permanent fixture and are tested on a monthly basis.

Some large-scale sirens are also deployed, like the Grifco Model 888, Grifco Model 777, and Klaxon SO4, which are used at fire stations for call-outs and at Sydney&#x27;s beaches for shark alarms. Alarms are also used around prisons for breakouts and at many factories and schools to announce start and finish times.

A siren is located at the Kwinana BP plant south of Perth; this syren is tested every Monday. It is used to evacuate the plant in case of an emergency and can be heard in Kwinana and certain parts of Rockingham. It can also be used to warn of severe weather and potentially dangerous emergencies on the Kwinana Industrial Strip.

In South Australia, a number of Country Fire Service stations have sirens on or near the stations. These are only activated when the brigade are responding to bushfire or grassfire events and for testing. They are not activated for every call, only as a public alert for the presence of bushfires.

There are electronic sirens that include Whelen, Telegrafia, SiRcom, Klaxon and Grifco.

In Victoria, many Country Fire Authority stations have sirens installed that are used to summon volunteers to an emergency callout, as well as consequently alerting the local community of brigade activity. Due to a variety of siren models in use across the state, there are two signals that are used, differentiated by length:
*Emergency callout: Siren sounds for no longer than 90 seconds.
*Community alert: Siren sounds for no less than five minutes.

In Melbourne&#x27;s CBD, there is a set of sirens installed to warn of attack and extreme flooding. These became necessary after the Bourke and Flinders St. attacks, where people were killed as a result of a person intentionally driving a vehicle into pedestrians.

In Queensland, Whelen Vortex-R4 sirens have been installed as part of the Somerset Regional Council Flood Warning System. At nearby Grantham, Queensland, a Whelen WPS-2906, which features both warning tones and pre-recorded messages provides early warning in the event of flooding. As well, Cairns Regional Council have installed nine Whelen WPS-2900 series sirens to alert to a dam breach of the nearby Copperlode Falls Dam. A map of the system can be found here, as well as additional information. Other Whelen WPS-2900 series sirens can be found in a few towns around Queensland as well.

====New Zealand====
Lower Hutt, Napier, Whanganui, and the former Waitakere City area of Auckland each have a network of civil defense sirens. The networks in Lower Hutt and Napier are bolstered by fire sirens that also function as civil defense sirens. Lower Hutt&#x27;s network is further bolstered by selected industrial sirens that double as civil defence sirens. In the western Bay of Plenty Region, several fire sirens also serve as civil defense sirens, and there are dedicated civil defense sirens at the Bay Park Raceway in Mount Maunganui, Tokoroa, and Whangamatā (which has two). Additionally, Tokoroa, Putāruru, Tīrau, and Whangamatā have fire sirens serving double duty as civil defense sirens. In the years following the tsunamis of the Indian Ocean earthquake in 2004, Meerkat electronic sirens were installed in all populated areas of the west coast lower than 10 metres.

Warning sounds vary from area to area, including rising and falling notes and Morse code sirens. Communities with volunteer fire brigades use a continuous note on all sirens for civil defense, and a warbling siren on the fire station siren only for fire callouts. Civil defense uses a distinctive &quot;sting&quot; siren that is used by all radio stations nationwide, but is currently only used for civil defense sirens in Wanganui.

Morocco, like many other countries, has civil defense sirens installed in several cities and towns such as Casablanca, Oujda, Asilah, M&#x27;diq, Chefchaouen, and Qalaat Sraghna. However, not all cities are equipped with this system. These sirens are typically located at fire stations and city halls. They were first introduced during the French and Spanish colonial era, and while some have been dismantled, many continue to operate to this day.
These sirens are strategically positioned in areas with high population densities like Casablanca, or in regions that are susceptible to natural disasters like floods, such as the Eureka siren. Additionally, they can also be found in tourist areas such as M&#x27;Diq and Chefchaouen, as well as in areas where dangerous industries are located.
Although these sirens are seldom used due to the rarity of imminent danger, they were recently utilized during the quarantine period of the pandemic. Sirens sounded in various cities, including Oujda, to alert the population of the nightly curfew. During the holy month of Ramadan, these sirens are employed to signal the arrival of the Fotour time.
In the past, these sirens were used in small towns to call for volunteer paramedics in emergencies such as fires or drowning incidents. However, in cities without sirens, the state utilizes alternative means to alert the public, such as broadcasting warning messages on television or radio, or sending SMS messages to citizens&#x27; phone numbers. In dangerous situations, police patrol car horns are also used to warn the public.
Surprisingly, the state does not allocate any specific days to test the sirens, and the reasons behind this remain unknown.

<text>The North Norfolk Railway (NNR) – also known as the &quot;Poppy Line&quot; – is a heritage steam railway in Norfolk, England, running between the towns of Sheringham and Holt. The North Norfolk Railway is owned and operated as a public limited company, originally called Central Norfolk Enterprises Limited. The railway is listed as exempt from the UK Railways (Interoperability) Regulations 2000.

== History ==

===Route history===
The line once formed part of the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway&#x27;s Melton Constable to Cromer Beach branch line. The first section, from Melton to Holt, was opened on 1 October 1884. After a suspension of work, the Holt to Cromer section of line was completed by direct labour and opened on 16 June 1887. A through Kings Cross to Cromer express started running in August 1887 and, although the construction had been expensive, the boost to revenue from the new line was considerable. A second train was put on the following year, in the down direction, consisting of coaches slipped at Peterborough from a GNR Manchester train. The time from Kings Cross to Cromer was typically hours, but the GER achieved to Cromer in hours.

The Lynn &amp; Fakenham Railway had proposed a branch from this line, at Kelling, to Blakeney, via Cley and Wiveton. The decision was taken not to go ahead with this line, but land for the proposed junction at Kelling had already been secured. Ballast sidings for the company developed in the Kelling area to service the needs of the company. In 1903, a station was added at Weybourne, having previously been refused.

Under the Railways Act 1921, the line, along with the rest of the M&amp;GN, was jointly managed by the LMS and LNER, retaining its own directors and staff. This continued until 1935, when the parent companies agreed that local administration should be undertaken by the LNER. The line became part of the Eastern Region of British Railways under the Transport Act 1947.

In 1954, British Railways announced the closure of the former Great Eastern Railway terminus at Cromer High, with all traffic being routed into the M&amp;GN station at Cromer Beach. The majority of the M&amp;GN system was closed to passengers on 28 February 1959, although the line between Melton Constable and Cromer retained a good level of passenger service - becoming an extension of the former GER line from Norwich.

The Beeching Report of April 1963 called for the end of passenger services between Melton Constable and Sheringham; this was approved by the government on 6 April 1964.

===Preservation history===

The Midland &amp; Great Northern Joint Railways Preservation Society formed in April 1959, initially hoping to save the 22-mile long to section; later, the North Walsham to and Themelthorpe to Melton Constable sections. After these plans proved impossible, attention turned to the section of line between Sheringham and Weybourne. In 1963, the Society formed &quot;North Norfolk Railways Limited&quot;, initially required to be titled the &quot;Central Norfolk Enterprises&quot; due to not owning any railway, to preserve and operate the line.

Sheringham station was still being used by British Rail services and, by the time the purchase had been completed, track lifting had taken place at Weybourne and some way towards Sheringham. Work on rebuilding the line started in 1965 and Sheringham station was leased by the society following closure in 1967 with two steam locomotives, two diesel railbuses and the LNER Quad-Art set being delivered on 4 June 1967.

Initially, trains were only operated for members. Operations over the line were later authorised through a Light Railway Order; the first was issued in 1975, under control of British Rail, and independently from 1976. An amendment order was issued in 1987, relating to the extension of the NNR to a new station site at Holt - using a parcel of land originally purchased as the junction for the never-built Blakeney branch.

At Sheringham, the line has now been reconnected to the town&#x27;s main station on the National Rail network, via an occasional-use level crossing; crossings by charter trains and visiting rolling stock are anticipated not to exceed 12 times a year. The North Norfolk Railway also operate a number of dining trains over the entire surviving section of the M&amp;GN, between Holt and Cromer, during summer months. Services began in 2016, working in partnership with the North Yorkshire Moors Railway, who were already a licensed operator on Network Rail. The Tourist information Centre and public toilets, that sat on the footprint of part of the trackbed between the station and the network rail link, were demolished and rebuilt in the style of the station, releasing the trackbed alignment for this development.

===Closure threat===

In 2001, it was announced that the railway was in danger of closure; this was due to the landlords of Sheringham station reportedly wanting to sell the site for redevelopment and the railway&#x27;s lease on the site expiring in June of that year. The railway was able to raise £290,000 to purchase the site, with offered funding including an interest-free, 5-year private loan of £150,000.

== Present day ==

There are two stations between Sheringham and Holt: Weybourne, which is about away from the village, and Kelling Heath Park.

The NNR operates both steam- and diesel-hauled services; it organises a programme of seasonal special events including steam galas, diesel galas, Santa and Norfolk Lights expresses. 

The main restoration sheds, including the former locomotive shed from Norwich City, are at Weybourne. They have room to accommodate four standard length British Railways Mark 1 coaches and six large steam or diesel locomotives. New carriage storage sheds have been built near Holt with £308,000 Heritage Lottery funding. These have the capacity to store the equivalent of 18 Mark 1 coaches.

A museum has been built at Holt to display artifacts from the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway. The station building at Holt was originally built at Stalham in 1883; it was moved, brick by brick, in 2002 and was re-erected in its current location. This project was awarded second place in the 2006 railway buildings competition by the Heritage Railway Association of the UK. The signal box at the station is over 100 years old and was restored on-site. The full signalling system at Holt, with 14 signals as well as the box, was commissioned in 2009 – winning the HRA signalling award for that year. The box was formerly at Upper Portland Sidings in the East Midlands. The Holt site also includes a reconstructed carriage house, which was completed in late 2009; it is a relocated example of the houses made with old railway carriages in the war years and a weighbridge recovered from Cambridge.

The railway is operated mainly by volunteers.

===Television, film and theatre use===

* In May 1973, the railway was the scene of filming for the episode &quot;The Royal Train&quot; of the popular TV programme &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;. 
* In 1983, the railway, and the then-unrestored Quad-Art set were used as locations in the filming of the adaption of &quot;Coot Club&quot;, part of the BBC series &quot;Swallows and Amazons Forever!&quot;. 
* In 1994, the railway provided a location for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Love on a Branch Line&quot;.
* Other productions that have used the line include &quot;The Lost Prince&quot;, &quot;All The King&#x27;s Men&quot;, &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; and &quot;Reel History of Britain&quot;.

==Route details==
Starting from Sheringham station, the lines follows the coast westwards, soon passing over the Automatic Open Crossing at Sweetbriar Lane, where the private road leading to &quot;Sheringham Golf Club&quot; crosses the line. The line climbs a 1 in 97 gradient, with the golf course, and Skelding Hill, on the seaward side of trains, while the A149 can be seen on the landward side of trains, roughly paralleling the tracks with Upper Sheringham visible in the distance. During WW2, Skelding Hill was the location for an emergency coastal battery, complete with an underground headquarters bunker.

The train then begins a 1 in 100 descent, passing under a farm occupation bridge and passing through a cutting on the edge of Deadman&#x27;s Hill, reputedly the burial place for plague victims from Weybourne village. After crossing over the A149 on Bridge 303 the train begins to climb a 1 in 80 gradient, and turns slightly inland. The village of Weybourne can be seen on the seaward side of the line.

The train next arrives at Weybourne, where the large locomotive and carriage works can be seen on the seaward side of the running line. The signal box was recovered from Holt, as the original was accidentally demolished by British Railways contractors after the line had been purchased by the North Norfolk Railway.

Leaving Weybourne, the train continues to climb a 1 in 80 gradient, passing the wooded site of the former &quot;Weybourne Springs Hotel&quot; that the station was built to serve. Kelling Heath Park is soon reached. This is a single coach platform, built during the restoration of the line, and sits on the gradient, so most locomotive-hauled trains only stop here when running in the down direction (towards Sheringham).

After passing through a deep cutting, the gradient eases and the train passes over a level crossing on Kelling Heath, turning further inland as it heads towards Holt. After passing under a road bridge, a modern carriage shed is passed on the inland side of the line. This area had once featured a number of ballast sidings used by the M&amp;GN.

The train now approaches the Holt station, with a signal box and reconstructed goods shed visible on the &quot;seaward&quot; side of the train. The line terminates here, but it is possible to see where the line originally continued towards Melton Constable.

== The future ==

With the level crossing at Sheringham reinstated, one of the next projects is to rebuild the demolished buildings on platform 2 at Sheringham station; the stanchions for the project are at Weybourne. This is seen as a medium to long-term project, but a start may be made soon on erecting the stanchions. The project has already seen a footbridge replaced.

Holt station is also being developed, with projects including erecting a footbridge. Currently awaiting restoration and installation is a 60 ft turntable from Hull (Botanic Gardens), purchased from the South Devon Railway.

==Rolling stock==

There are a variety of preserved steam and diesel locomotives, diesel multiple units, passenger coaches and goods wagons. Most of these are typical of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) branch lines in Norfolk. Some are owned by the railway itself, but most are owned by various individuals or voluntary groups. The line is also regularly visited by locomotives based elsewhere; some locomotives come for a day on a railtour, others for a few days or weeks to take part in a special gala, but a few stay for many months and form part of the stock working scheduled trains.

==Accidents==
*On 30 October 1984, a volunteer died after falling from bridge 303 during the rebuilding of the structure, which crosses the Coast Road.

*On 19 September 2015, London &amp; North Eastern Railway Class B12 4-6-0 No. 8572, running light engine, collided with the buffers at the Holt terminus of the line. The buffers were partially demolished, and the fire service attended. The fireman was slightly injured and was checked over in hospital.

*On 17 November 2018, Great Eastern Railway Class Y14 0-6-0 locomotive 564 was in collision with a car on the level crossing accessing Sheringham golf course, while travelling at about 10 mph. The car was badly damaged, but nobody was hurt and the train and rail infrastructure was not damaged. This automatic open level crossing, controlled by lights which were working properly at the time, is the only one in regular use on the railway. The car driver was later fined for his involvement.

==Funding and associated bodies==
The railway relies on a variety of sources to fund its operation. Funding sources have included:

A £419,000 carriage store (Bridge Road Carriage Sheds) was constructed close to Holt with the help of a 2006 grant of £308,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund. A path from Holt station was included, but stops just before the sheds, with no public access to the site being possible.

In April 2013, the line was awarded £99,500 from the National Lottery Heritage Fund (NLHF) to further its restoration and education programmes, specifically to show the impact railways had on the development of the London suburbs.

In 2016, the line was celebrating the completion of a new Tourist Information Centre at Sheringham and a new boiler shop at Weybourne, which were made possible by a £498,000 award from the government&#x27;s Coastal Community Fund. North Norfolk District Council also awarded £154,000 towards the work.

In April 2020, the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway Society, backers of the North Norfolk Railway, purchased Hunslet 0-6-0ST locomotive No. 1982, &quot;Ring Haw&quot; and a crane from the company in order to release funds for the line and ensure that the vehicles remained on the North Norfolk Railway.

In July 2020, the line was given a grant of £46,500 towards reinstating train services from the NLHF Emergency appeal.

In October 2020, the line was awarded £360,000 from the Culture Recovery Fund (from the Heritage and the Heritage Stimulus Fund), funded by the government and administered by Historic England and the NLHF.

<doc id="51025" wikidata="Q3503392" url="?curid=51025" title="Electroplating">
<text>Electroplating, also known as electrochemical deposition or electrodeposition, is a process for producing a metal coating on a solid substrate through the reduction of cations of that metal by means of a direct electric current. The part to be coated acts as the cathode (negative electrode) of an electrolytic cell; the electrolyte is a solution of a salt whose cation is the metal to be coated, and the anode (positive electrode) is usually either a block of that metal, or of some inert conductive material. The current is provided by an external power supply.

Electroplating is widely used in industry and decorative arts to improve the surface qualities of objects—such as resistance to abrasion and corrosion, lubricity, reflectivity, electrical conductivity, or appearance. It is used to build up thickness on undersized or worn-out parts and to manufacture metal plates with complex shape, a process called electroforming. It is used to deposit copper and other conductors in forming printed circuit boards and copper interconnects in integrated circuits. It is also used to purify metals such as copper.

The aforementioned electroplating of metals uses an electroreduction process (that is, a negative or cathodic current is on the working electrode). The term &quot;electroplating&quot; is also used occasionally for processes that occur under electro-oxidation (i.e positive or anodic current on the working electrode), although such processes are more commonly referred to as anodizing rather than electroplating. One such example is the formation of silver chloride on silver wire in chloride solutions to make silver/silver-chloride (AgCl) electrodes.

Electropolishing, a process that uses an electric current to selectively remove the outermost layer from the surface of a metal object, is the reverse of the process of electroplating.

&quot;Throwing power&quot; is an important parameter that provides a measure of the uniformity of electroplating current, and consequently the uniformity of the electroplated metal thickness, on regions of the part that are near to the anode compared to regions that are far from it. It depends mostly on the composition and temperature of the electroplating solution, as well as on the operating current density. A higher throwing power of the plating bath results in a more uniform coating.

==Process==

The electrolyte in the electrolytic plating cell should contain positive ions (cations) of the metal to be deposited. These cations are reduced at the cathode to the metal in the zero valence state. For example, the electrolyte for copper electroplating can be a solution of copper(II) sulfate, which dissociates into Cu2+ cations and anions. At the cathode, the Cu2+ is reduced to metallic copper by gaining two electrons.

When the anode is made of the metal that is intended for coating onto the cathode, the opposite reaction may occur at the anode, turning it into dissolved cations. For example, copper would be oxidized at the anode to Cu2+ by losing two electrons. In this case, the rate at which the anode is dissolved will equal the rate at which the cathode is plated, and thus the ions in the electrolyte bath are continuously replenished by the anode. The net result is the effective transfer of metal from the anode to the cathode.

The anode may instead be made of a material that resists electrochemical oxidation, such as lead or carbon. Oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, and some other byproducts are then produced at the anode instead. In this case, ions of the metal to be plated must be replenished (continuously or periodically) in the bath as they are drawn out of the solution.

The plating is most commonly a single metallic element, not an alloy. However, some alloys can be electrodeposited, notably brass and solder. Plated &quot;alloys&quot; are not &quot;true alloys&quot; (solid solutions), but rather they are tiny crystals of the elemental metals being plated. In the case of plated solder, it is sometimes deemed necessary to have a true alloy, and the plated solder is melted to allow the tin and lead to combine into a true alloy. The true alloy is more corrosion-resistant than the as-plated mixture.

Many plating baths include cyanides of other metals (such as potassium cyanide) in addition to cyanides of the metal to be deposited. These free cyanides facilitate anode corrosion, help to maintain a constant metal ion level, and contribute to conductivity. Additionally, non-metal chemicals such as carbonates and phosphates may be added to increase conductivity.

When plating is not desired on certain areas of the substrate, &quot;stop-offs&quot; are applied to prevent the bath from coming in contact with the substrate. Typical stop-offs include tape, foil, lacquers, and waxes.

===Strike===
Initially, a special plating deposit called a &quot;strike&quot; or &quot;flash&quot; may be used to form a very thin (typically less than 0.1 μm thick) plating with high quality and good adherence to the substrate. This serves as a foundation for subsequent plating processes. A strike uses a high current density and a bath with a low ion concentration. The process is slow, so more efficient plating processes are used once the desired strike thickness is obtained.

The striking method is also used in combination with the plating of different metals. If it is desirable to plate one type of deposit onto a metal to improve corrosion resistance but this metal has inherently poor adhesion to the substrate, then a strike can be first deposited that is compatible with both. One example of this situation is the poor adhesion of electrolytic nickel on zinc alloys, in which case a copper strike is used, which has good adherence to both.

===Pulse electroplating===

The pulse electroplating or pulse electrodeposition (PED) process involves the swift alternating of the electrical potential or current between two different values, resulting in a series of pulses of equal amplitude, duration, and polarity, separated by zero current. By changing the pulse amplitude and width, it is possible to change the deposited film&#x27;s composition and thickness.

The experimental parameters of pulse electroplating usually consist of peak current/potential, duty cycle, frequency, and effective current/potential. Peak current/potential is the maximum setting of electroplating current or potential. Duty cycle is the effective portion of time in a certain electroplating period with the current or potential applied. The effective current/potential is calculated by multiplying the duty cycle and peak value of the current or potential. Pulse electroplating could help to improve the quality of electroplated film and release the internal stress built up during fast deposition. A combination of the short duty cycle and high frequency could decrease surface cracks. However, in order to maintain the constant effective current or potential, a high-performance power supply may be required to provide high current/potential and a fast switch. Another common problem of pulse electroplating is that the anode material could get plated and contaminated during the reverse electroplating, especially for a high-cost, inert electrode such as platinum.

Other factors that affect the pulse electroplating include temperature, anode-to-cathode gap, and stirring. Sometimes, pulse electroplating can be performed in a heated electroplating bath to increase the deposition rate, since the rate of most chemical reactions increases exponentially with temperature per the Arrhenius law. The anode-to-cathode gap is related to the current distribution between anode and cathode. A small gap-to-sample-area ratio may cause uneven distribution of current and affect the surface topology of the plated sample. Stirring may increase the transfer/diffusion rate of metal ions from the bulk solution to the electrode surface. The ideal stirring setting varies for different metal electroplating processes. 

===Brush electroplating===
A closely-related process is brush electroplating, in which localized areas or entire items are plated using a brush saturated with plating solution. The brush, typically a graphite body wrapped with an absorbent cloth material that both holds the plating solution and prevents direct contact with the item being plated, is connected to the anode of a low-voltage and 3-4 ampere direct-current power source, and the item to be plated (the cathode) is grounded. The operator dips the brush in plating solution and then applies it to the item, moving the brush continually to get an even distribution of the plating material.

Brush electroplating has several advantages over tank plating, including portability, the ability to plate items that for some reason cannot be tank plated (one application was the plating of portions of very large decorative support columns in a building restoration), low or no masking requirements, and comparatively low plating solution volume requirements. Mainly used industrially for part repair, worn bearing surfaces getting a nickel or silver deposit. With technological advancement deposits up to .025&quot; have been achieved and retained uniformity. Disadvantages compared to tank plating can include greater operator involvement (tank plating can frequently be done with minimal attention and the solutions used are often toxic), and the inconsistency in achieving as great a plate thickness.

===Barrel plating===

This technique of electroplating is one of the most common used in the industry for large numbers of small objects. The objects are placed in a barrel-shaped non-conductive cage and then immersed in a chemical bath containing dissolved ions of the metal that is to be plated onto them. The barrel is then rotated, and electrical currents are run through the various pieces in the barrel, which complete circuits as they touch one another. The result is a very uniform and efficient plating process, though the finish on the end products will likely suffer from abrasion during the plating process. It is unsuitable for highly ornamental or precisely engineered items.

=== Cleanliness ===
Cleanliness is essential to successful electroplating, since molecular layers of oil can prevent adhesion of the coating. ASTM B322 is a standard guide for cleaning metals prior to electroplating. Cleaning includes solvent cleaning, hot alkaline detergent cleaning, electrocleaning, ultrasonic cleaning and acid treatment. The most common industrial test for cleanliness is the waterbreak test, in which the surface is thoroughly rinsed and held vertical. Hydrophobic contaminants such as oils cause the water to bead and break up, allowing the water to drain rapidly. Perfectly clean metal surfaces are hydrophilic and will retain an unbroken sheet of water that does not bead up or drain off. ASTM F22 describes a version of this test. This test does not detect hydrophilic contaminants, but electroplating can displace these easily, since the solutions are water-based. Surfactants such as soap reduce the sensitivity of the test and must be thoroughly rinsed off.

==Test cells and characterization==

===Throwing power===
&quot;Throwing power&quot; (or &quot;macro throwing power&quot;) is an important parameter that provides a measure of the uniformity of electroplating current, and consequently the uniformity of the electroplated metal thickness, on regions of the part that are near the anode compared to regions that are far from it. It depends mostly on the composition and temperature of the electroplating solution. &quot;Micro throwing power&quot; refers to the extent to which a process can fill or coat small recesses such as through-holes. Throwing power can be characterized by the dimensionless Wagner number:

formula_1

where &quot;R&quot; is the universal gas constant, &quot;T&quot; is the operating temperature, &quot;κ&quot; is the ionic conductivity of the plating solution, &quot;F&quot; is the Faraday constant, &quot;L&quot; is the equivalent size of the plated object, &quot;α&quot; is the transfer coefficient, and &quot;i&quot; the surface-averaged total (including hydrogen evolution) current density. The Wagner number quantifies the ratio of kinetic to ohmic resistances. A higher Wagner number produces a more uniform deposition. This can be achieved in practice by decreasing the size (&quot;L&quot;) of the plated object, reducing the current density |&quot;i&quot;|, adding chemicals that lower &quot;α&quot; (make the electric current less sensitive to voltage), and raising the solution conductivity (e.g. by adding acid). Concurrent hydrogen evolution usually improves the uniformity of electroplating by increasing |&quot;i&quot;|; however, this effect can be offset by blockage due to hydrogen bubbles and hydroxide deposits. 

The Wagner number is rather difficult to measure accurately; therefore, other related parameters, that are easier to obtain experimentally with standard cells, are usually used instead. These parameters are derived from two ratios: the ratio of the plating thickness of a specified region of the cathode &quot;close&quot; to the anode to the thickness of a region &quot;far&quot; from the cathode and the ratio of the distances of these regions through the electrolyte to the anode. In a Haring-Blum cell, for example, for its two independent cathodes, and a cell yielding plating thickness ratio of &quot;M&quot; = 6 has Harring-Blum throwing power . Other conventions include the Heatley throwing power , Field throwing power , and Luke throwing power . A more uniform thickness is obtained by making the throwing power larger (less negative), except for Luke&#x27;s throwing power, which has the advantage of having a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 100, in terms of the less negative value, according to any of these definitions.

Parameters that describe cell performance such as throwing power are measured in small test cells of various designs that aim to reproduce conditions similar to those found in the production plating bath.

===Haring–Blum cell===
The Haring–Blum cell is used to determine the macro throwing power of a plating bath. The cell consists of two parallel cathodes with a fixed anode in the middle. The cathodes are at distances from the anode in the ratio of 1:5. The macro throwing power is calculated from the thickness of plating at the two cathodes when a direct current is passed for a specific period of time. The cell is fabricated out of perspex or glass.

===Hull cell===

The Hull cell is a type of test cell used to semi-quantitatively check the condition of an electroplating bath. It measures useable current density range, optimization of additive concentration, recognition of impurity effects, and indication of macro throwing power capability. The Hull cell replicates the plating bath on a lab scale. It is filled with a sample of the plating solution and an appropriate anode which is connected to a rectifier. The &quot;work&quot; is replaced with a Hull cell test panel that will be plated to show the &quot;health&quot; of the bath.

The Hull cell is a trapezoidal container that holds 267 milliliters of a plating bath solution. This shape allows one to place the test panel on an angle to the anode. As a result, the deposit is plated at a range current densities along its length, which can be measured with a Hull cell ruler. The solution volume allows for a semi-quantitative measurement of additive concentration: 1 gram addition to 267 mL is equivalent to 0.5 oz/gal in the plating tank.

==Effects==
Electroplating changes the chemical, physical, and mechanical properties of the workpiece. An example of a chemical change is when nickel plating improves corrosion resistance. An example of a physical change is a change in the outward appearance. An example of a mechanical change is a change in tensile strength or surface hardness, which is a required attribute in the tooling industry. Electroplating of acid gold on underlying copper- or nickel-plated circuits reduces contact resistance as well as surface hardness. Copper-plated areas of mild steel act as a mask if case-hardening of such areas are not desired. Tin-plated steel is chromium-plated to prevent dulling of the surface due to oxidation of tin.

==Alternatives to electroplating==

There are a number of alternative processes to produce metallic coatings on solid substrates that do not involve electrolytic reduction:

* Electroless deposition uses a bath containing metal ions and chemicals that will reduce them to the metal by redox reactions. The reaction should be autocatalytic, so that new metal will be deposited over the growing coating, rather than precipitated as a powder through the whole bath at once. Electroless processes are widely used to deposit nickel-phosphorus or nickel-boron alloys for wear and corrosion resistance, silver for mirror-making, copper for printed circuit boards, and many more. A major advantage of these processes over electroplating is that they can produce coatings of uniform thickness over surfaces of arbitrary shape, even inside holes, and the substrate need not be electrically conducting. Another major benefit is that they do not need power sources or specially-shaped anodes. Disadvantages include lower deposition speed, consumption of relatively expensive chemicals, and a limited choice of coating metals.
* Immersion coating processes exploit displacement reactions in which the substrate metal is oxidized to soluble ions while ions of the coating metal get reduced and deposited in its place. This process is limited to very thin coatings, since the reaction stops after the substrate has been completely covered. Nevertheless, it has some important applications, such as the electroless nickel immersion gold (ENIG) process used to obtain gold-plated electrical contacts on printed circuit boards.
* Sputtering uses an electron beam or a plasma to eject microscopic particles of the metal onto the substrate in a vacuum.
* Physical vapor deposition transfer the metal onto the substrate by evaporating it.
* Chemical vapor deposition uses a gas containing a volatile compound of the metal, which gets deposited onto the substrate as a result of a chemical reaction.
* Gilding is a traditional way to attach a gold layer onto metals by applying a very thin sheet of gold held in place by an adhesive.
==History==
Electroplating was invented by Italian chemist Luigi Valentino Brugnatelli in 1805. Brugnatelli used his colleague Alessandro Volta&#x27;s invention of five years earlier, the voltaic pile, to facilitate the first electrodeposition. Brugnatelli&#x27;s inventions were suppressed by the French Academy of Sciences and did not become used in general industry for the following thirty years. By 1839, scientists in Britain and Russia had independently devised metal-deposition processes similar to Brugnatelli&#x27;s for the copper electroplating of printing press plates.
Research from the 1930s had theorized that electroplating might have been performed in the Parthian Empire using a device resembling a Baghdad Battery, but this has since been refuted; the items were fire-gilded using mercury.

Boris Jacobi in Russia not only rediscovered galvanoplastics, but developed electrotyping and galvanoplastic sculpture. Galvanoplastics quickly came into fashion in Russia, with such people as inventor Peter Bagration, scientist Heinrich Lenz, and science-fiction author Vladimir Odoyevsky all contributing to further development of the technology. Among the most notorious cases of electroplating usage in mid-19th century Russia were the gigantic galvanoplastic sculptures of St. Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral in Saint Petersburg and gold-electroplated dome of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow, the third tallest Orthodox church in the world.

Soon after, John Wright of Birmingham, England discovered that potassium cyanide was a suitable electrolyte for gold and silver electroplating. Wright&#x27;s associates, George Elkington and Henry Elkington were awarded the first patents for electroplating in 1840. These two then founded the electroplating industry in Birmingham from where it spread around the world. The Woolrich Electrical Generator of 1844, now in Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum, is the earliest electrical generator used in industry. It was used by Elkingtons.

The Norddeutsche Affinerie in Hamburg was the first modern electroplating plant starting its production in 1876.

As the science of electrochemistry grew, its relationship to electroplating became understood and other types of non-decorative metal electroplating were developed. Commercial electroplating of nickel, brass, tin, and zinc were developed by the 1850s. Electroplating baths and equipment based on the patents of the Elkingtons were scaled up to accommodate the plating of numerous large-scale objects and for specific manufacturing and engineering applications.

The plating industry received a big boost with the advent of the development of electric generators in the late 19th century. With the higher currents available, metal machine components, hardware, and automotive parts requiring corrosion protection and enhanced wear properties, along with better appearance, could be processed in bulk.

The two World Wars and the growing aviation industry gave impetus to further developments and refinements, including such processes as hard chromium plating, bronze alloy plating, sulfamate nickel plating, and numerous other plating processes. Plating equipment evolved from manually-operated tar-lined wooden tanks to automated equipment capable of processing thousands of kilograms per hour of parts.

One of the American physicist Richard Feynman&#x27;s first projects was to develop technology for electroplating metal onto plastic. Feynman developed the original idea of his friend into a successful invention, allowing his employer (and friend) to keep commercial promises he had made but could not have fulfilled otherwise.

<text>A patronymic, or patronym, is a component of a personal name based on the given name of one&#x27;s father, grandfather (more specifically an avonymic), or an earlier male ancestor. It is the male equivalent of a matronymic.

Patronymics are used, by custom or official policy, in many countries worldwide, although elsewhere their use has been replaced by or transformed into patronymic surnames. Examples of such transformations include common English surnames such as Johnson (son of John).

==Origins of terms==
The usual noun and adjective in English is &quot;patronymic&quot;, but as a noun this exists in free variation alongside &quot;patronym&quot;. The first part of the word &quot;patronym&quot; comes from Greek πατήρ &quot;patēr&quot; &#x27;father&#x27; ( πατρός &quot;patros&quot; whence the combining form πατρο- &quot;patro&quot;-); the second part comes from Greek ὄνυμα &quot;onyma&quot;, a variant form of ὄνομα &quot;onoma&quot; &#x27;name&#x27;. In the form &quot;patronymic&quot;, this stands with the addition of the suffix (&quot;-ikos&quot;), which was originally used to form adjectives with the sense &#x27;pertaining to&#x27; (thus &#x27;pertaining to the father&#x27;s name&#x27;). These forms are attested in Hellenistic Greek as πατρώνυμος (&quot;patrōnymos&quot;) and πατρωνυμικός (&quot;patrōnymikos&quot;). The form &quot;patronym&quot;, first attested in English in 1834, was borrowed into English from French &quot;patronyme&quot;, which had previously borrowed the word directly from Greek. &quot;Patronymic&quot;, first attested in English in 1612, has a more complex history. Both Greek words had entered Latin, and, from Latin, French. The English form &quot;patronymic&quot; was borrowed through the mutual influence of French and Latin on English.

==History==

In many areas around the world, patronyms predate the use of family names. Family names in many Celtic, Germanic, Iberian, Georgian, Armenian and Slavic languages originate from patronyms, e.g. Wilson (son of William), FitzGerald (son of Gerald), Powell (from &quot;ap Hywel&quot;), Fernández (son of Fernando), Rodríguez (son of Rodrigo), Andersson or Andersen (son of Anders, Scandinavian form of Andrew), Carlsen (son of Carl), Ilyin (of Ilya), Petrov (of Peter), Grigorovich (son of Grigory, Russian form of Gregory), Stefanović (son of Stefan, little Stefan), MacAllister (from &quot;mac Alistair&quot;, meaning son of Alistair, anglicized Scottish form of Alexander) and O&#x27;Conor (from &quot;Ó Conchobhair&quot;, meaning grandson/descendant of Conchobhar). Other cultures which formerly used patronyms have switched to the more widespread style of passing the father&#x27;s last name to the children (and wife) as their own.
In Iceland, family names are unusual; Icelandic law favours the use of patronyms (and more recently, matronyms) over family names.

==Historical and current use==
===Africa===
Traditionally Muslim and non-Arabic speaking African people, such as Hausa and Fulani people, usually (with some exceptions) follow the Arab naming pattern. The word or phrase meaning &quot;son of&quot; is, however, omitted. As such, Mohamed son of Ibrahim son of Ahmed is &quot;Mohamed Ibrahim Ahmed&quot;, and Mohamed Ibrahim Ahmed&#x27;s son Ali is &quot;Ali Mohamed Ibrahim&quot;.

====Ethiopia and Eritrea====

The naming convention used in Eritrea and Ethiopia does not have family names and surnames. A person is referred to by a single name: this is always the person&#x27;s given name. Ethiopians and Eritreans use a naming pattern very similar to the Arab naming pattern, but with one exception: no suffix or prefix. The full name of a person is usually two but officially registered with three names. The person&#x27;s given name comes first, followed by their father&#x27;s given name and (optionally, for official purposes) their grandfather&#x27;s name last. For example, a person named Lemlem Mengesha Abraha has Lemlem as her given name, Mengesha (from her father&#x27;s name) Abraha (grandfather&#x27;s name). The grandfather&#x27;s name is usually only added in official documents and not used in everyday life. The father&#x27;s name is not considered a middle name but a last name, without it being a family name or surname. Women do not take their husband&#x27;s last name. They continue to go independently by their given name, followed by their father&#x27;s name, and then their grandfather&#x27;s name, even after marriage. In both Ethiopia and Eritrea, a person is always addressed by their first name; for example Mrs. Lemlem or Dr. Lemlem.

====Kenya====
Some Kenyan communities used patronyms. As of 2010, the practice has largely dropped off with the use of just the father&#x27;s last name as a surname.
Kalenjin use &#x27;arap&#x27; meaning &#x27;son of&#x27;; 
Kikuyu used &#x27;wa&#x27; meaning &#x27;of&#x27;. Because of polygamy, matronyms were also used and &#x27;wa&#x27; used to identify which wife the child was born of; 
Maasai use &#x27;ole&#x27; meaning &#x27;son of&#x27;; 
Meru use &#x27;mto&#x27; abbreviated M&#x27; thus son of Mkindia would be M&#x27;Mkindia, pronounced Mto Mkindia.

====Mozambique====
Patronymic naming is very common in parts of Mozambique. Although the practice is not universal, patronymic naming has been documented in the Zambezia province.

====Nigeria====
Although not as prominent as during the pre-colonial period, some Nigerians (particularly in the North) continue using patronymics — either as a middle name, as the first part of a hyphenated surname, or as a surname. An example of the use of patronymic middle names would be a man named Adamu Abdulkabiru Jibril — whereby &quot;Adamu&quot; would be his given first name, &quot;Abdulkabiru&quot; would be his father&#x27;s given name as a patronymic middle name, and &quot;Jibril&quot; would be his hereditary family surname. Other people hyphenate their surname to include a patronymic, in which case the example would be named Adamu Abdulkabiru-Jibril with &quot;Abdulkabiru-Jibril&quot; acting as his surname. Using patronymics as the sole surname is also possible, with the example being named Adamu Abdulkabiru with &quot;Abdulkabiru&quot; acting as his surname.

====Somalia====
Somalis use their paternal grandfather&#x27;s given name as their legal surname for documentation purposes. They also use the term &quot;ina&quot; or &quot;iña&quot; meaning &quot;the son of&quot; or &quot;the daughter of,&quot; which is similar to other African and Arab naming patterns. For example, the name &quot;Ahmed Mohamed Ali Farah&quot; means &quot;Ahmed son of Mohamed son of Ali son of Farah.&quot; When stating one&#x27;s lineage, one will say &quot;Ahmed ina Mohamed&quot; (meaning Ahmed, the son of Mohamed). To identify themselves and the sub-clan they belong to, Somalis memorize their long lineage back to a common ancestor. Women never adopt their husband&#x27;s patronym but keep their own for life.

====South Africa====
Among the Zulu, patronymics were used in the pre-colonial era. The prefix &quot;ka&quot; was attached to the father&#x27;s name, for example Shaka kaSenzangakhona means Shaka son of Senzangakhona. The practice disappeared from everyday use with the introduction of the European-style surname system but still remains part of traditional cultural practices, particularly in the case of chieftains and royalty where reciting lineages forms a part of many ceremonial occasions.

===East Asia===
====Taiwanese Aborigines====
Atayal people&#x27;s given names are followed by the name of their father; both son and daughter use patronymics. 
Amis people&#x27;s sons’ given names are also followed by their father&#x27;s name, while daughters’ given names are followed by their mother&#x27;s name. By contrast, the Seediqs often get to choose which parent&#x27;s name goes after their own.

====Mongolia====
Mongol people&#x27;s names are preceded by the name of their father and possessive marker; both son and daughter are patronymics.

====China====
Many indigenous ethnic groups in Yunnan, such as Yi, Hani, Jingpo, Jino, Derung, Nu, Wa, Hmong and Yao, use a son-father patronymic naming system (). Historically, Naxi and Bai have also used the patronymic system. The last one or two syllables of the father&#x27;s name transfers to become the first one or two syllables of the son&#x27;s name. The last one or two syllables of the son&#x27;s name is then used as the first one or two syllables of the grandson&#x27;s name. The naming tradition is closely tied to Tibeto-Burman traditions.

This system can be seen in the names of Nanzhao, Dali and Lijiang rulers.

Nanzhao kings: Xinuluo (細奴邏)－&quot;Luo&quot;sheng (邏盛)－&quot;Sheng&quot;luopi (盛邏皮)－&quot;Pi&quot;luoge (皮邏閣)－&quot;Ge&quot;luofeng (閣邏鳳)－&quot;Feng&quot;jiayi (鳳迦異)－&quot;Yi&quot;mouxun (異牟尋)－&quot;Xun&quot;gequan (尋閣勸)－&quot;Quan&quot;longsheng (勸龍晟)

Dali kings: Duan Zhixiang (段智祥)－Duan &quot;Xiang&quot;xing (段祥興)－Duan &quot;Xing&quot;zhi (段興智)

Regents of Dali Kingdom: Gao Shengtai (高升泰)－Gao &quot;Tai&quot;ming (高泰明)－Gao &quot;Ming&quot;shun (高明順)－Gao &quot;Shun&quot;zhen (高順貞)－Gao &quot;Zhen&quot;shou (高貞壽)－Gao &quot;Shou&quot;chang (高壽昌)

Lijiang chiefs: A-ts&#x27;ung A-liang (阿琮阿良)－&quot;A-liang&quot; A-hu (阿良阿胡)－&quot;A-hu&quot; A-lieh (阿胡阿烈)－&quot;A-lieh&quot; A-chia (阿烈阿甲)－&quot;A-chia&quot; A-te (阿甲阿得)－&quot;A-te&quot; A-ch&#x27;u (阿得阿初)－&quot;A-ch&#x27;u&quot; A-t&#x27;u (阿初阿土)－&quot;A-t&#x27;u&quot; A-ti (阿土阿地)－&quot;A-ti&quot; A-hsi (阿地阿習)－&quot;A-hsi&quot; A-ya (阿習阿牙)－&quot;A-ya&quot; A-ch&#x27;iu (阿牙阿秋)－&quot;A-ch&#x27;iu&quot; A-kung (阿秋阿公)－&quot;A-kung&quot; A-mu (阿公阿目)－&quot;A-mu&quot; A-tu (阿目阿都)－&quot;A-tu&quot; A-sheng (阿都阿勝)－&quot;A-sheng&quot; A-chai (阿勝阿宅)－&quot;A-chai&quot; A-ssu (阿宅阿寺)－&quot;A-ssu&quot; A-ch&#x27;un (阿寺阿春)－&quot;A-ch&#x27;un&quot; A-su (阿春阿俗)－&quot;A-su&quot; A-wei (阿俗阿胃)－&quot;A-wei&quot; A-hui (阿胃阿揮)－&quot;A-hui&quot; A-chu (阿揮阿住)

===South Asia===
====India====

A patronymic is common in parts of India. For example, if a father is named Ramprasad Sachin Pandey (a masculine name), he might name his son Sunil Ramprasad Pandey, who in turn might name his son Sanjeev Sunil Pandey. As a result, unlike surnames, patronymics will not pass down through many generations.

In Tamil Nadu and some parts of Kerala and South Karnataka, patronymy is predominant. This is a significant departure from the rest of the country where caste names are mostly employed as surnames. This came into common use during the 1950s and 1960s when the Dravidian movement campaigned against the use of one&#x27;s caste as part of the name.

However, rather than using the father&#x27;s full name, only the first letter, popularly known as the initial, is prefixed to the given name. For example, if a person&#x27;s given name is &quot;Nikhilesh&quot; and his father&#x27;s &quot;Rajaraman&quot;, then the full name is &quot;R. Nikhilesh&quot; and is seldom expanded, even in official records. Only if absolutely necessary, such as when applying for an Indian passport, which does not usually allow initials, is the initial expanded and the name rendered in reverse order as &quot;Nikhilesh Rajaraman&quot; or sometime in the original order as &quot;Rajaraman Nikhilesh&quot;. Some families follow the tradition of retaining the name of the hometown, the grandfather&#x27;s name, or both as initials. The celebrated Indian English novelist R. K. Narayan&#x27;s name at birth was Rasipuram Krishnaswami Ayyar Narayanaswami, which was shortened at the behest of his writer friend Graham Greene. Rasipuram is a toponym, and Krishnaswami Ayyar is a patronym.

In Tamil Nadu, the patronymic naming convention diverges significantly from other regions of India, influenced by a social justice movement aimed at eliminating caste-based discrimination. Traditionally, many Indian states used patronyms or surnames to reflect familial heritage and caste, but Tamil Nadu&#x27;s system intentionally disrupts this structure.

In this system, individuals often use their father&#x27;s given name as an initial or surname. For example, &quot;R. Karthik&quot; signifies Karthik, son of Rajesh, with &quot;R&quot; representing his father&#x27;s name. Unlike other Indian states, where the patronym serves as a marker of lineage or social status, Tamil Nadu&#x27;s system allows for the patronym to change with each generation, ensuring that no permanent surname is passed down. This shift reflects the state&#x27;s broader efforts to dismantle caste markers in society, a key initiative of the Dravidian movement led by figures like Periyar E.V. Ramasamy in the 20th century.

However, the use of initials and surnames in Tamil Nadu remains flexible, leaving it to the individual&#x27;s discretion. For instance, the late Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi preferred to be addressed as M. Karunanidhi, where &quot;M&quot; stood for his father, Muthuvel&#x27;s, name. His son, M. K. Stalin, incorporates both his father&#x27;s and grandfather&#x27;s names, while Stalin&#x27;s son chooses to go by Udhayanidhi Stalin, using his father&#x27;s name as his surname rather than as an initial.

This flexibility extends beyond political figures. In sports, cricketer Ravichandran Ashwin, whose father&#x27;s name is Ravichandran, prefers to be known as &quot;R. Ashwin&quot; or &quot;Ravichandran Ashwin.&quot; This choice is particularly relevant in sports commentary, where players are often referred to by their surnames. Since it would be incorrect to call him by his father&#x27;s name alone, Ashwin uses his given name in conjunction with his father&#x27;s name.

There is also a growing trend in Tamil Nadu to expand initials in ways that align with how names sound in the Tamil language. For example, some choose to expand names phonetically, such as &quot;Pala. Karuppiah&quot; instead of &quot;P. Karuppiah,&quot; or &quot;Pa. Ranjith&quot; rather than &quot;P. Ranjith,&quot; to reflect a closer approximation of the name in Tamil.

In the academic and professional world, scientists like M. Annadurai expand their names to &quot;Mayilsami Annadurai,&quot; though it would be inappropriate to address him by his father&#x27;s name, Mayilsami. Instead, he is referred to by his given name, Annadurai, underscoring the unique flexibility and personalization that Tamil Nadu&#x27;s naming conventions allow.

This evolution in Tamil naming practices highlights both the influence of social justice reforms and the cultural adaptability within the state. While Tamil Nadu has largely moved away from caste-based surnames, the naming system retains a focus on individual identity, free from rigid lineage-based structures, distinguishing it from other Indian states.

While the usage of caste names as surnames/last names is discouraged (but not banned) in Tamil Nadu, such usage by out-of-state people is greeted with indifference. So, Lakshmi Menon, Shilpa Shetty, etc. are referred by their preferred names which include their caste names. Likewise, old Tamil names with the caste in them are also fully used while referring to them such as Pasumpoan Muthuramalinga Thevar, U.Ve. Swaminatha Iyer, V.O Chidambaram Pillai etc.

To further reinforce Tamil Nadu&#x27;s efforts in promoting social equality through its naming conventions, the Madras High Court recently directed the removal of community and caste names from government school names across the state. This move aligns with the state&#x27;s long-standing policies to reduce caste-based distinctions in public life, including naming practices. The court&#x27;s decision reflects the state&#x27;s dedication to social justice by eliminating caste markers, particularly in institutions that shape young minds. This legal step ensures that the caste system is not perpetuated through the education system, aligning with the larger movement that has shaped Tamil Nadu&#x27;s approach to names and identity over the past century.

This final ruling serves as an important reminder of the state&#x27;s commitment to dismantling caste-based identity and promoting a more egalitarian social structure, further cementing Tamil Nadu&#x27;s unique position in its approach to names, identity, and social justice.

In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, the naming pattern is a family name, given name and caste name in that order, but sometimes the caste name is omitted. If a name appears like Alugupally Sudhir Reddy, Alugupally is the family name, Sudhir is the given name and Reddy is the caste name. If you find a name like Gorle Sunil Kumar, Gorle is the family name, and Sunil Kumar the given name. Here, the caste name is omitted. Of late, some people are writing their names in the order of given name, caste name, and family name. Sometimes, the caste name is omitted here too. It can be seen in names like Satyanarayana Bandi, where Satyanarayana is the given name, and Bandi the family name.

In Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Gujarat, a very common convention among the Hindu communities is to have the patronymic as the middle name. Examples:

* First Deputy Prime Minister and first Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel&#x27;s full name is Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel, where Jhaverbhai is his father&#x27;s given name.
* Cricketer Sachin Tendulkar&#x27;s full name is Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar, where Ramesh is his father&#x27;s given name.
* Cricketer Sunil Gavaskar&#x27;s full name is Sunil Manohar Gavaskar, where Manohar is his father&#x27;s given name. Sunil Gavaskar&#x27;s son Rohan Gavaskar would be Rohan Sunil Gavaskar, and so on.
* India&#x27;s 15th Prime Minister Narendra Modi famously took the oath of office as the Prime Minister of India as Narendra Damodardas Modi, wherein Damodardas is his father&#x27;s given name. He prefers to write his full name, including his father&#x27;s name as his middle name.

This system works for both boys and girls, except that after marriage, a woman takes her husband&#x27;s given name as her middle name – her new middle name is no longer a patronymic. East Slavic naming customs are similar, except that the suffix &quot;-yevich&quot;, &quot;-yevna&quot;, or something similar is used in a Russian language patronymic.

Indians of the Muslim Isma&#x27;ili sect also have patronymic middle names that use the father&#x27;s first name and the grandfather&#x27;s first name plus a family name. Someone called &quot;Ramazan Rahim Ali Manji&quot; might call his son &quot;Karim Ramazan Rahim Manji&quot; and his granddaughter might be called &quot;Zahra Karim Ramazan Manji&quot;.

=====Indian diaspora=====
Indians in Singapore and Malaysia, particularly those of Tamil descent, often continue the patronymic tradition. This entails having a single given name, followed by son/daughter of, followed by their father&#x27;s name.

====Pashtuns====
Main Article: Zai (suffix)

Pashtuns have a -zai or -zay suffix meaning &quot;son of&quot;, with tribe names being formed over it.

===Southeast Asia===
In Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, ethnic Malays generally follow the Arabic patronymic naming system of &quot;given name&quot; + bin/binti or son of/daughter of (often abbreviated SO/DO) + &quot;father&#x27;s name&quot;. Non-Muslim indigenous Sarawakians use the &quot;anak&quot; in place of bin/binti or SO/DO, &quot;anak&quot; being the Malay word for &quot;child&quot;, while indigenous Sabahans may use &quot;bin&quot; or &quot;binti&quot;. However, not all Malays use patronymics, in Thailand they have adopted surnames, while in Indonesia they do not usually have either. Tamil Malaysians have this naming system, but they use &quot;a/l&quot; (&quot;anak lelaki&quot;) and &quot;a/p&quot; (&quot;anak perempuan&quot;) instead, and in some cases, patronymics may be placed first and abbreviated like Indian counterparts.

Singaporean Indians use the abbreviations s/o (son of) or d/o (daughter of), while Malaysian Indians typically use the respective Malay variations &quot;anak lelaki&quot; (abbreviated &quot;a/l&quot;) or &quot;anak perempuan&quot; (abbreviated &quot;a/p&quot;). In some cases, individuals may opt to omit the patronymic indicator and abbreviate the patronymic for ease of usage. For example, a former deputy minister of Malaysia Pathmanaban a/l Kunjamboo was more commonly referred to as K. Pathmanaban and veteran Singaporean politicians Shanmugam Kasiviswanathan and Suppiah Dhanabalan went by K. Shanmugam and S. Dhanabalan respectively. The individual may opt not to include &quot;son of&quot; or &quot;daughter of&quot; in their legal name, as in the case of Shanmugam and Dhanabalan.

In Brunei, the ruling family of the monarch uses &quot;given name&quot; + &quot;ibni&quot; + &quot;father&#x27;s name&quot; instead of using bin/binti.

In Indonesia, there are a number of ethnic groups with different naming systems. The Batak of North Sumatra (Sumatra Utara) give every child the family&#x27;s name. Sometimes the family&#x27;s name is prefixed by Huta-, Batu-, etc., but most use Si-, such as Sitanggang, Sihombing, Sibutar-butar, Sinaga, or Sitohang. The family&#x27;s name is given from the father&#x27;s family. For example, if the father&#x27;s name is Boggi Sinaga who married Moetia Siregar then all children will be given the family&#x27;s name of Sinaga.

In Sunda, a similar cultural rule is used to that of the Batak. The family&#x27;s name for Sunda is -Wijaya, but that is not true for all Sundanese families.

==== Armenian ====
The use of patronymics was introduced in Armenia by Russians during the times of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. Before that period, the use of patronymics was very limited. Patronymics are usually formed by the addition of &quot;i&quot; (&quot;of&quot;, pronounced as &quot;ee&quot;) to the father&#x27;s name, e.g. if the father&#x27;s name is &quot;Armen&quot;, the corresponding patronymic would be &quot;Armeni&quot; (of Armen). The Russified version of the same patronymic would be &quot;Armenovich&quot; for males and &quot;Armenovna&quot; for females. After Armenia regained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 there was a massive decline in the use of Russified patronymics; nowadays few Armenians use patronymics outside of official contexts.

Many Armenian surnames were once patronymics first used by distant ancestors or clan founders. These are characterized by the suffix &quot;-ian&quot; in Western Armenian, often transliterated as &quot;-yan&quot; in Eastern Armenian. These are appended to the given name, i.e. Kardashian, Asdvadzadourian, Tankian, Hagopian, Khachadourian, Mardirosian, Bedrosian, Sarkissian, etc. Note that the suffix &quot;-ian&quot; was also appended to trades, as in Adakhtsakordzian (issued from the carpenter), Chalian (issued from the candlemaker), Darbinian (issued from the smith).

Of particular note are the surnames of the children of married priests, or . Though not as common nowadays, it was customary for a long time for these children (particularly the sons) to change their last names to the name-in-religion of their father. For example, the son of Ter (Reverend) Bartev would change his last name to Ter Bartevian.

==== Azerbaijani ====

In Azeri, patronymics are formed through &quot;-oğlu&quot; (sometimes transliterated as &quot;ogly&quot;) for males and &quot;qızı&quot; (often transliterated as &quot;gizi&quot; or &quot;kizi&quot;) for females. Before the late 19th–early 20th century, patronymics were used as an essential part of a person&#x27;s full name, i.e. &quot;Sərdar İlyas oğlu&quot; (&quot;Sardar, son of Ilyas&quot;) and &quot;Mina Nebi qızı&quot; (&quot;Mina, daughter of Nabi&quot;), since surnames were mostly non-existent before Sovietization (with the exception of the upper and some middle-class families). After surnames were commonly adopted in Azerbaijan in the 1920s, patronymics still remained parts of full names, i.e. &quot;Sardar Ilyas oğlu Aliyev&quot; (&quot;Sardar Aliyev, son of Ilyas&quot;). Nowadays in Azerbaijan, patronymics sometimes replace surnames in unofficial use. Normally in such case, they are spelled as one word (i.e. &quot;Eldar Mammadoğlu&quot;, &quot;Sabina Yusifqızı&quot;). Many Azeri surnames are also derived from Persian-style patronymics ending in &quot;-zadeh&quot; (&quot;Kazimzadeh&quot;, &quot;Mehdizadeh&quot;, etc.). They are found among both Caucasian and Iranian Azeris. However, unlike the former, Azeris in Iran do not generally use patronymics in &quot;oglu&quot; / &quot;qizi&quot;. Azeri patronymics are not to be confused with Turkish surnames in &quot;-oğlu&quot; and Greek surnames in -ογλού (&quot;-oglou&quot;), which do not have specific female versions and do not reflect names of fathers.

====Semitic cultures====
A common feature of historical Semitic names is use of a patronymic system. Since ancient times, men and women have been named using this system. This was not limited to any certain region or religion. It was only in the 17th and 18th centuries when laws were put in place in European nations demanded that those of Semitic descent abandoned the patronymic naming scheme in favor of consistent legal surnames. It was only after these laws were ratified that most of the Jews and Muslims in these nations received surnames.

===== Arabic =====

In Arabic, the word ( or : , and sometimes and to show the grammatical case of the noun) is the equivalent of the &quot;-son&quot; suffix discussed above, and () means &quot;daughter of&quot;. Thus, for example, means &quot;Ali son of ʿAmr&quot;. In Classical Arabic, the word is written as between two names, since the case ending of the first name then supplies a vowel. is often written as , and as , in name formulas rendered from Arabic into Roman characters. Thus Hisham ibn al-Kalbi is alternatively written as . However, the pronunciation is dialectal and has nothing to do with either the spelling or pronunciation in Classical Arabic. The word ( or in different grammatical cases) means &quot;father of&quot;, so is another name for .
In Northwest Africa, the patronymic is romanized as , reflecting local pronunciation. See for example () and &quot;Ben Ali&quot; ().

In medieval times, an illegitimate child of unknown parentage would sometimes be termed , &quot;son of his father&quot; (notably Ziyad ibn Abihi.) In the Qur&#x27;an, Jesus (Isa in Arabic) is consistently termed – a matronymic (in the Qur&#x27;an, Jesus has no father; see Jesus in Islam). An Arabic patronymic can be extended as far back as family tree records will allow: thus, for example, Ibn Khaldun gave his own full name as .

Patronymics are still standard in parts of the Arab world, notably Saudi Arabia and Iraq (in the case of Iraq, with or omitted.) However, some of the Arab world has switched to a family name system. As in English, the new family names are sometimes based on what was formerly a patronymic. The form most used in the Arab world is the usage of both the patronymic and a family name, often using both the father&#x27;s and paternal grandfathers given name in sequence after the own given name, and then the family name. In Iraq, for example, full names are formed by combining the given name of an individual with the given name of their father (sometimes the father is skipped and the paternal grandfather&#x27;s given name is used instead, sometimes both father and paternal grandfather are used), along with the town, village, or clan name. For instance, Hayder Karar Hussein al-Mousawi is named Hayder, the son of Karrar, the grandson of Hussein, and from the family of Mousawi (This is the surname given to the offspring of the Imam Musa al-Kazim). 
In Saudi Arabia, naming conventions are similar to Iraq&#x27;s but family names are used much more often.

===== Aramaic =====
In Aramaic, the prefix bar- means &quot;son&quot; and is used as a prefix meaning &quot;son of&quot;. In the Bible, Peter is called Bar-Jonah in Matthew 16:17 and Nathanael is possibly called Bartholomew because he is the son of Tolmai (or son of Ptolemy, with &quot;P&quot; being reduced). The titles can also be figurative, for example in Acts 4:36–37 a man named Joseph is called Barnabas meaning &quot;son of consolation&quot;. The feminine equivalent, b&#x27;rat-, is found in the Targumim.

Mandaean names also often make use of the prefix &quot;bar-&quot;.

===== Hebrew =====
In the Hebrew patronymic system, commonly used by Jews, the first name is followed by ben- (&quot;son of&quot;) or bat- (&quot;daughter of&quot;), and then the father&#x27;s or mother&#x27;s name, or both.

===== Assyrian =====
The Assyrians for centuries have used the patronymic bet or bit literally meaning &quot;house&quot; in Assyrian Neo-Aramaic; however, in the context of the name it means &quot;from the house of [the father&#x27;s name].&quot;

==== Persian ====
In Persian, patronymics are formed by names ending with the suffix &quot;-pur&quot; for men and &quot;-dokht&quot; for women. For example: Shahpur (son of king) and Sinapur (son of Sina). Depending on country, some suffixes are more common than others. For example, in Iran, the suffix &quot;-pur&quot; is common while in Afghanistan, the suffix &quot;-Zadah&quot; or &quot;-Zad&quot; is common, although --Zadeh is common in Iran.

====Turkish====

In Turkish, the suffixes used to indicate paternal ancestry are &quot;-oğlu&quot; and &quot;-zade&quot;, which indicate the ancestry as coming from a certain man. Like many other patronymics in other languages, with the formalization of naming conventions by laws in the late modern contemporary age many turned into surnames. After the &#x27;Surname revolution&#x27; in 1934, many people chose professions or habitat as surnames with or without the suffix &quot;-oğlu&quot;, such as &quot;Elbeyioğlu&quot;, &quot;Bakkaloğlu&quot; or &quot;Giritlioğlu&quot; and with &quot;-zade&quot; such as &quot;Beyzade&quot;, &quot;Mehmedzade&quot;, &quot;Yusufzade&quot;.

==== Kurdish ====
In Kurdish Language, generally, a triple name system is used which is patronymic and avonymic. That is the name of the individual followed by the father&#x27;s name and the paternal grandfather&#x27;s name without any modification of the names and are completely gender neutral. This style of naming is used in all official documentation in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region. Surnames are not officially used and most people do not even have a surname or family name, those who do, they usually derive their surnames from the name of their place of birth, place of origin, clan or tribe names, etc. The Kurdish names in Turkey, Iran and Syria are heavily influenced by the official naming systems in the respective countries.

===Europe===
In Europe, patronyms were formerly widespread but later became confined to Scandinavia, Iceland, and some Eastern Slavic cultures.

====English====

In England, names ending with the suffix &quot;-son&quot; or &quot;-ing&quot; were often originally patronymic. In addition, the archaic French (more specifically, Norman) prefix &quot;fitz&quot; (cognate with the modern French &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;son&quot;) appears in England&#x27;s aristocratic family lines dating from the Norman Conquest, and also among the Anglo-Irish. Thus there are names such as Fitzgerald, Fitzmaurice and Fitzhugh. In addition, the name &quot;Fitzroy&quot;, meaning &quot;son of [the] king&quot; (&quot;roy&quot;), was sometimes used by illegitimate royal children.

====Irish, Scottish, and Manx====

The use of &quot;Mac&quot; in some form was prevalent in Scottish Gaelic, Irish, and Manx, in all of which it denotes &quot;son.&quot; &quot;Mc&quot; is also a frequent anglicisation in both Scotland and Ireland. In Ireland, the forms &quot;Mag&quot; and &quot;M&#x27;&quot; are encountered. The prefix &quot;Mac&quot; is used to form a patronym, such as &quot;Mac Coinnich&quot;—or the anglicized &quot;Mackenzie&quot;—son of Coinneach/Kenneth. The female equivalent of &quot;Mac&quot; is &quot;Nic&quot;, condensed from &quot;nighean mhic&quot; (in Scottish Gaelic) or &quot;iníon mhic&quot; (in Irish), both meaning daughter. For example, the Scottish Gaelic surname, &quot;Nic Dhòmhnaill&quot; meaning &quot;daughter of a son of Dòmhnall&quot; (in English, Donald), as in &quot;Mairi Nic Dhòmhnaill&quot;, or Mary MacDonald.

At the north end of the Irish Sea, in Ulster, the Isle of Man, and Galloway (indeed as far north as Argyll), &quot;Mac&quot; was frequently truncated in speech to /k/. This led to such anglicisations as &quot;Qualtrough&quot; (Son of Walter) and &quot;Quayle&quot; (son of Paul, cf. MacPhail), usually beginning with &quot;C,&quot; &quot;K,&quot; or &quot;Q.&quot; In Ireland, this truncation resulted in surnames such as &quot;Guinness&quot; (son of Aonghus, cf. MacAonghusa), beginning usually in &quot;C&quot; or &quot;G&quot; for patronymics prefixed with Mac, and in &quot;H&quot; (e.g., &quot;Hurley&quot; [descendant of Iarlath, cf. Ua h-Iarfhlatha/O&#x27;Hurley]) for surnames prefixed with &quot;O.&quot; Colloquial Scottish Gaelic also has other patronymics of a slightly different form for individuals, still in use (for more information please see: Scottish Gaelic personal naming system).

====Welsh and Cornish====

Before the 1536 Act of Union, the Welsh did not generally employ surnames, but instead used epithets (e.g. Selyf Sarffgadau, &quot;Selyf the Battle-Serpent&quot;), patronyms (e.g. Rhodri ap Merfyn, &quot;Rhodri son of Merfyn&quot;), and (much less often) matronyms (e.g. Rhodri map Nest, &quot;Rhodri son of Nest&quot;) to identify people.

Welsh, as a P-Celtic language, originally used &quot;map&quot; or &quot;mab&quot; instead of the Q-Celtic &quot;mac&quot; employed in Ireland and Scotland. These were later simplified to the modern Welsh &quot;ap&quot; and &quot;ab&quot;. A common practice is to use &quot;mab&quot;/&quot;ab&quot; before a father&#x27;s name beginning with a vowel (e.g., Llywelyn mab Iorwerth), but the two alternative forms are also employed arbitrarily in many sources.

Daughters were indicated by &quot;ferch&quot; or &quot;verch&quot; (mutated from &quot;merch&quot;, &quot;girl, daughter&quot;). &quot;Angharad verch Owain&quot; would be &quot;Angharad, daughter of Owain&quot;.

After the Acts of Union, this led to many Welsh surnames being variants of their father or ancestor&#x27;s personal name: &quot;ap&quot; or &quot;ab Ieuan&quot; often became &quot;Evans&quot;; &quot;ap Rhys&quot;, &quot;Price&quot;; &quot;ap&quot; or &quot;ab Owain&quot;, &quot;Bowen&quot;; &quot;ap Hywel&quot;, &quot;Powell&quot; or &quot;Howell&quot;. In addition to these Anglicised baptismal and official names, patronyms continued to be commonly employed in Welsh until the Industrial Revolution, particularly in the north and west of Wales. Patronyms were sometimes employed within the English names as well by using the father&#x27;s personal name as the sons&#x27; middle name.

Perhaps because Cornwall was legally incorporated into England earlier than Wales was, patronyms (e.g.) are less common there than toponyms (e.g. Tresillian, Trevithick, Nanskeval/Nankeville) and occupational surnames (e.g. An Gof, [An] Gove, &quot;(Blacksmith)&quot;; Helyer (Cornish dialect – possibly a slater or huntsman ()).

====Dutch====
In Dutch, patronymics were often used in place of family names or as middle names. Patronymics were composed of the father&#x27;s name plus an ending &quot;-zoon&quot; for sons, &quot;-dochter&quot; for daughters. For instance, Abel Janszoon Tasman is &quot;Abel son of Jan Tasman&quot;, and Kenau Simonsdochter Hasselaer: &quot;Kenau, daughter of Simon Hasselaer&quot;. In written form, these endings were often abbreviated as &quot;-sz.&quot; and &quot;-dr.&quot; respectively e.g. Jeroen Cornelisz. &quot;Jeroen son of Cornelis&quot;, or Dirck Jacobsz. The endings &quot;-s&quot;, &quot;-se&quot; and &quot;-sen&quot; were also commonly used for sons and often for daughters too. In the northern provinces, &quot;-s&quot;, as genitive case, was almost universally used for both sons and daughters. The suffix -&quot;x&quot; as in &quot;Tacx&quot; or &quot;Hendrix&quot; also denoted the son or daughter of... and is now integrated as a complete name.

Patronymics were common in the Dutch United Provinces until the French invasion in 1795 and subsequent annexation in 1810. As the Netherlands were now a province of France, a registry of births, deaths and marriages was established in 1811, whereupon emperor Napoleon forced the Dutch to register and adopt a distinct surname.

====French====

In France, the terms &quot;patronyme&quot; and &quot;nom patronymique&quot; had long been used interchangeably to designate the family name, meaning that it is inherited from the father.

The tradition of patronymic lineage is still used among some Canadian descendants of French colonists: in the oral tradition of many Acadians, for example, &quot;Marc à Pierre à Gérard&quot; (lit. &quot;Marc of Pierre of Gérard&quot;), means &quot;Marc, son of Pierre, grandson of Gérard&quot;.

====Italian====

The Italian language used to designate patronymics in formal writing up to 1975 using the preposition &quot;di&quot; (English &quot;of&quot;) for a living father and &quot;fu&quot; (English &quot;late&quot;) for a deceased one. That is, &quot;Mario di Giovanni Rossi&quot; meant that Mario Rossi is the son of a living man named Giovanni; &quot;Francesco fu Pietro Verdi&quot; meant that Francesco Verdi is the son of a deceased man named Pietro. When the father&#x27;s name was unknown, institutions could use the formula N.N. (&quot;Nomen nescio&quot;, Latin for &quot;I don&#x27;t know the name&quot;) or use the mother&#x27;s name or omit this part entirely.

In parish records written in Latin, the father&#x27;s name would be written in genitive with no preposition. For a deceased father, the particle &quot;quondam&quot; (English &quot;once/formerly&quot;) was added. The examples above would have been translated as &quot;Marius Johannis Rossi&quot; and &quot;Franciscus quondam Petri Verdi&quot;.

Patronymics are not in common usage in modern Italian. However, some of them have been the source of various surnames. As an example, the individuals descended from a man named &quot;Paolo&quot; could have gained the patronymic surnames &quot;Paolo&quot;, &quot;Di Paolo&quot;, &quot;De Paoli&quot;, &quot;Paoli&quot;, &quot;Polo&quot;, &quot;Pagolo&quot;, &quot;Pagoli&quot;, &quot;Paolino&quot;, &quot;Lino&quot;, etc.

====Iberian languages====

In the past, both in Spanish and Portuguese, the endings &quot;-ez&quot; and &quot;-es&quot; tended to be conflated since pronunciation was quite similar in the two languages. Today, Portuguese has been fully standardized to &quot;-es&quot;; Spanish is also standardized to &quot;-ez&quot;, but it is very common to see archaic endings in &quot;-es&quot;. For instance, Pires/Peres and Pérez are the modern equivalents of English &quot;Peterson&quot; in Portuguese and Spanish.

In Portugal, there are some surnames that had a patronymic genesis but, while still common, no longer indicate patronymic usage. For instance, &quot;Álvares&quot; was the son of &quot;Álvaro&quot; and &quot;Gonçalves&quot; was the son of &quot;Gonçalo&quot; (it was the case of Nuno Álvares Pereira, son of Álvaro and Gonçalves Pereira, son of Gonçalo Pereira). Other cases include &quot;Rodrigues&quot; (&quot;son of Rodrigo&quot;), &quot;Nunes&quot; (&quot;son of Nuno&quot;) and &quot;Fernandes&quot; (&quot;son of Fernando&quot;).
In the same way, the surname Soares means son of Soeiro (in Latin Suarius). It comes from Latin Suaricius (son of Suarius); the Latin genitive suffix &quot;-icius/a&quot; was used to indicate a patronymic. Later it became Suáriz, Suárez (both Spanish), and eventually Soares (Portuguese). Another theory attributes the Iberian -ez style patronymics to Germanic (Visigothic) rather than Latin influence.

Spanish patronyms follow a similar pattern to the Portuguese (e.g., López: son of Lope; Fernández: son of Fernando; Martínez: son of Martín; Rodríguez: son of Rodrigo; Álvarez: son of Álvaro). Common endings include -ez, -az, -iz, -is and -oz. However, not all surnames with similar endings are necessarily patronymic. For example, Chávez is not the son of &quot;Chavo&quot;, but comes from Galician or Portuguese &quot;chaves&quot;, meaning &quot;keys&quot;, with the &quot;s&quot; denoting the plural form of &quot;chave&quot;, as is the case of key/keys in English.

However, these kinds of surnames were unusual outside the Crown of Castile. Apart from natural spelling variations (such as using Giménez or Ximénez), modern orthographic standardisation in each Iberian dialect brought a number of crossed versions. It is possible to find the Catalan language politician Jordi Sànchez (whose surname, while Spanish, has a grave accent – characteristic of Catalan – instead of the acute accent used in Spanish) or the journalist Vicenç Sanchis (who spells his surname in a way that is closer to Catalan, but with the ch digraph characteristic of Spanish).

Due to the letters, z and s being pronounced alike in Latin American dialects of Spanish, many non-patronymic surnames with an -es have come to be written with an -ez. In Hispano-American Spanish, the -ez spellings of Chávez (Hugo Chávez), Cortez (Alberto Cortez) and Valdez (Nelson Valdez) are not patronymic surnames, but simply variant spellings of the Iberian Spanish spelling with -es, as in the names of Manuel Chaves, Hernán Cortés and Víctor Valdés. For more on the -z surnames in Spanish see Influences on the Spanish language.

====Norse languages====
In Norse custom, patronyms and matronyms were formed by using the ending -son (later -søn and -sen in Danish, Norwegian and German) to the genitive form of the father&#x27;s name to indicate &quot;son of&quot;, and -dóttir (Icelandic and Faroese -dóttir, Swedish and Norwegian -dotter, Danish and Norwegian -datter) for &quot;daughter of&quot;. The resulting patronymic was generally not used as a surname; however, a third name, a so-called byname based on location or personal characteristic, was often added to differentiate people and could eventually develop into a kind of family name. Some Early Modern examples of the latter practice, where the patronymic was placed after the given name and was followed by the surname, are Norwegian Peder Claussøn Friis, the son of Nicolas Thorolfsen Friis (Claus in Claussøn being short for Nicolas) and Danish Thomas Hansen Kingo, the son of Hans Thomsen Kingo.

Eventually, most Nordic countries replaced or complemented this system with the prevailing &quot;international&quot; standard of inherited family names. In Norway, for example, the parliament passed a family name act in 1923, citing the rising population and the need to avoid the confusion of new last names in every generation. The law does allow a person to retain a patronymic as a middle name in addition to the surname, as was common in Early Modern times; this is not a common practice but does occur, a modern example being Audhild Gregoriusdotter Rotevatn. The Danish government outlawed the practice in 1856 and eased the regulations in 1904 to deal with the limited number of patronymics. In Sweden the practice of children keeping their father&#x27;s and wives taking their husband&#x27;s patronymic as a surname occurred in the 18th century but was first prevalent in the late 19th century. Patronymics were normal in Sweden, at least in rural Sweden, until the 19th century. From the end of the 19th-century patronymics gradually became less common in Sweden until they were abolished in 1966. In 1982 the right to use patronyms (and matronyms) was partially restored; a person (or the parents of a child) had to apply and pay a fee. From 1 July 2017 parents in Sweden are free to give their children patronyms/matronyms at birth instead of inherited family names, and any person can change their last name to a matronymic or patronymic.

Matronyms were used exceptionally if the child was born out of wedlock, or if the mother was much more high-born or well-known than the father, a historical example being Sweyn Estridsson.

In Iceland, patronymics or matronymics are still used as last names, and this is, in fact, required by law, with a handful of exceptions. For almost all cases, the father&#x27;s name (usually in the genitive case) is used, plus the word &quot;son&quot; for sons or &quot;dóttir&quot; for daughters. For example, Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir (i.e. &quot;Jóhanna, daughter of Sigurð[ur]&quot;). People who do not identify as male or female (nonbinary people) can also use the suffix &quot;-bur&quot;, which means &quot;child of&quot;&quot;.

In 2022, the Swedish Tax Agency denied a Gotland woman&#x27;s application to change her surname to one with the Gutnish ending &quot;-dotri&quot; (instead of &quot;-dotter&quot;) on the grounds that it did not follow Swedish conventions. The administrative court in Stockholm decided in her favour on appeal, with the Tax Agency in turn taking the case to the Court of Appeal; in early 2023, the Court of Appeal finally ruled that she was allowed to use a Gutnish surname.

====Finnish====
In Finland, the use of patronymics was a result of relatively-recent Swedish influence and remained uncommon outside official documents. It was only in the 19th century that the use of patronymics gained any sort of popularity among the Finnish-speaking lower classes. Family names became obligatory in Finland by law in 1920.

Historically, patronymics were composed in Swedish fashion: the father&#x27;s name and the suffix &quot;-n&quot; for genitive plus the word &quot;poika&quot; for sons, &quot;tytär&quot; for daughters. For example, Tuomas Abrahaminpoika means &quot;Tuomas, Abraham&#x27;s son&quot;, and Martta Heikintytär means &quot;Martta, Heikki&#x27;s daughter&quot;.

====Bulgarian====
In Bulgarian, the patronymics are &quot;-ov&quot; / &quot;-ev&quot; for men and &quot;-ova&quot; / &quot;-eva&quot; for women. They are identical to the endings of family names in Bulgarian and some other Slavic family names, such as those in Russian and Czech. In Bulgarian official documents, the patronymic comes before the surname, so &quot;Ivan Marinov Yordanov&quot; would be &quot;Ivan&quot;, son of &quot;Marin Yordanov&quot;.

====Georgian====

In Georgian, patronymics, when used, add &quot;s&quot; to the end of the father&#x27;s name, followed by &quot;dze&quot; for a man and &quot;asuli&quot; for a woman. For example, Joseph Stalin&#x27;s original name was Ioseb Besarionis Dze Jugashvili. After the end of the Soviet Union, patronymics in Georgia have become disused as a Russian tradition.

Georgian family names derive mostly from patronymics, nicknames and places of origin. Two common elements, &quot;dze&quot; and &quot;shvili&quot; mean &quot;son of&quot; and &quot;child&quot; respectively.

====Greek====
Most Greek surnames are patronymics by origin albeit in various forms depending on the ancestral locality. Diminutive suffixes that denote &quot;son of&quot; or, more generally, &quot;descendant of&quot; start with the given name such as Δημήτριος &quot;Dēmétrios&quot; and then have the patronymic surname such as Dēmētr&quot;ópoulos&quot; (Peloponnese), Dēmētr&quot;ákos&quot; (Laconia), Dēmētr&quot;éas&quot; (Messenian Mani), Dēmētr&quot;átos&quot; (Cephalonia), Dēmētr&quot;ákēs&quot; (Crete), Dēmētr&quot;iádēs&quot;/Dēmētr&quot;-ídēs&quot; (Pontus, Asia Minor), Dēmētr&quot;éllēs&quot; (Lesbos), Dēmétr&quot;oglou&quot; (Asia Minor) (identical to Turkish patronym &quot;-oğlu&quot;), or simply &quot;Dēmētríou&quot; (especially common in Cyprus, with the first name in the genitive) are formed. The same principle can apply to surnames deriving from professions. For example, as from παπάς, &quot;papás&quot; &quot;priest&quot;, are derived the surnames &quot;Papadópoulos&quot;, &quot;Papadákos&quot;, &quot;Papadéas&quot;, &quot;Papadátos&quot;, &quot;Papadákēs&quot;, &quot;Papadéllēs&quot;, &quot;Papazoglou&quot; etc., all of which signify a &quot;priest&#x27;s son&quot;. The same may apply in combination: &quot;Papanikoláou, Papanikolópoulos&quot;, &quot;the son of the priest Nikolaos&quot;. A daughter&#x27;s family name is the same as the son&#x27;s but is &quot;always&quot; declined in the genitive: &quot;Dēmētropoúlou, Papanikoláou&quot;.

In addition to those surnames, actual patronymics are used in official documents as &quot;middle names&quot; preceding the surname. For example, the children of a &quot;Ioánnis Papadópoulos&quot; can be &quot;María Ioánnou Papadopoúlou&quot; and &quot;Andréas Ioánnou Papadópoulos&quot; (&quot;Ioánnou&quot; is the genitive of &quot;Ioánnis&quot;). Traditionally, a married woman would adopt her husband&#x27;s family name. Now, however, women in Greece can keep their own surnames if they choose.

====Hungarian====

In Hungarian, patronyms were traditionally formed with the ending &quot;-fi&quot; (sometimes spelled as &quot;-fy&quot; or &quot;-ffy&quot;). That system is no longer in common use, but traces can still be found in some frequent current surnames such as &quot;Pálfi&quot; (son of Paul), &quot;Győrfi&quot;, &quot;Bánfi&quot; or Sándor Petőfi (a famous poet who chose the Hungarian form instead of his Slavic birth name, &quot;Petrovics&quot;). In the Old Hungarian period (10th–16th century, see History of Hungarian), surnames were not in common use, and the full genitive was represented as in &quot;Péter fia András&quot; (&quot;Peter&#x27;s son Andrew&quot;). Such forms are in frequent use in charters and legal documents from that time. In Hungarian, the surname precedes the given name.

====Romanian====

In Romanian, the endings &quot;-escu&quot; and &quot;-eanu&quot; were used, as in &quot;Petrescu&quot;, &#x27;son of Petre (Peter)&#x27;; many modern Romanian family names were formed from such patronymics. Less commonly, matronymics formed with the genitive form (using the prefix &quot;a-&quot;) were used, as in &quot;Amariei&quot;, &#x27;(son/daughter) of Maria&#x27;.

====Russian====
In Russian the endings and &quot;-ich&quot; are used to form patronymics for men. It would be cognate to the Latin genitive -ici, used for marking the family line, and also as equivalent to &#x27;little&#x27; -Vladic= &#x27;the little Vlad&#x27;. For women, the respective endings are or . For example, in Russian, a man named Ivan with a father named Nikolay would be known as Ivan Nikolayevich or &quot;Ivan, son of Nikolay&quot; (&quot;Nikolayevich&quot; being a patronymic). Likewise, a woman named Lyudmila with a father named Nikolay would be known as Lyudmila Nikolayevna or &quot;Lyudmila, daughter of Nikolay&quot; (&quot;Nikolayevna&quot; being a patronymic). For masculine names ending in a vowel, such as Ilya or Foma, when they are used as a base for the patronymic, the corresponding endings are &quot;-ich&quot; (for men) and (for women). Examples in titles of classical Russian literature include&quot; The Tales of the Late Ivan Petrovich Belkin&quot;, &quot;The Death of Ivan Ilyich&quot; and &quot;The Tale of How Ivan Ivanovich Quarreled with Ivan Nikiforovich&quot;.

In Russia, the patronymic is an official part of the name, used in all official documents, and when addressing somebody both formally and among friends. The correct written order of a full name is surname, given name, then patronymic – this order would be found on official documents, business cards, and formal addresses. For example, a woman named Mariya Iosifovna Zhukova would hand you a business card that says Zhukova Mariya Iosifovna. Use of the given name followed by the patronymic in Russian is always the neutral, correct and polite way to address any person except close friends, family members, or children – in such cases usage of the patronymic adds humorous intonation of exaggerated but well-meant respect. This form would be congruent to the Western use of Mr. and the surname for the polite and proper use and reference. Instead of schoolchildren calling their teacher Ms. and surname, the proper form would be given name and patronymic. For example, a teacher named Anna Borisovna Kopylova would always be called Anna Borisovna by her pupils. When addressing a much younger person, only the first name is commonly used. Individuals are addressed by their given name followed by the patronymic (e.g., &quot;Mikhail Nikolayevich&quot;) in many situations including on formal occasions, by colleagues at work, by acquaintances, or when being addressed by someone younger in age. It is becoming more common for younger individuals (under 50) to drop the patronymic at work. In informal situations, if a person is called by a diminutive (such as Misha for Mikhail or Nastya for Anastasia), the patronymic is not used.

In colloquial, informal speech, it is also possible to contract the ending of a patronymic: thus Nikolayevich becomes Nikolaich, and Stepan Ivanovich becomes Stepan Ivanych or simply Ivanych as the given name may be omitted altogether. In this case, the contraction, if possible, is obligatory: Ivan Sergeyevich Sidorov may be called &quot;Sergeich&quot; or, more rarely, &quot;Sergeyevich&quot;. In contrast to male names, if a woman is called by her patronymic name without a given name, the patronymic is usually not contracted: &quot;Ivanovna&quot; but &quot;Mar&#x27; Ivanna&quot;; &quot;Sergeyevna&quot; or &quot;Sergevna&quot; is one exception, where both forms are fine. Typically, a patronymic name alone is a familiar form of addressing an older female.

====Serbian====

Vuk Karadžić reported in the 19th century that Serbs sometimes used their old family names, and sometimes patronymics. Vuk Karadžić himself used patronymic “Stefanović” (son of Stefan, equivalent of Steven), and sometimes Karadžić, old family name. However, nowadays, the patronymic names in Serbia are mostly used on legal documents, and have the form of the father&#x27;s name that says the child is &#x27;of so and so&#x27;... example: Marija Dragoljuba Pavlović, where Dragoljub is the father&#x27;s name and &#x27;Dragoljuba&#x27; literally means &#x27;of Dragoljub&#x27;. There are also other forms, like to include – the father&#x27;s name – in brackets: Maria (Dragoljub) Pavlović.

It became more common to include the name of any one of the parents in legal documents (&#x27;ime jednog roditelja&#x27;) – in practice this is usually still the father&#x27;s name.

In Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia, the patronymic names do not change form between masculine and feminine. Example: Marija Dragoljuba Pavlović (Dragoljub is the father&#x27;s name; Dragoljuba is the form that says she is his daughter or literally &#x27;of Dragoljub&#x27;). However, in the past, unmarried Serbian women&#x27;s surnames ended in -eva, while married Serbian women&#x27;s surnames ended in -ka.

====Ukrainian====

In Ukrainian, the female patronymic always ends with - (-&quot;ivna&quot;) or - (-&quot;yivna&quot;). The male patronymic always ends with - (-&quot;ovych&quot;) or - (-&quot;yovych&quot;). Exception: &quot;Illia&quot; () → &quot;Illich&quot; () (e.g. Illia Illich Mechnikov), &quot;Sava&quot; () → &quot;Savych&quot; (), &quot;Yakiv&quot; () → &quot;Yakovych&quot; ().

Patronyms are part of the full name and are obligatory in formal messages. They are frequent in common speech, such as to call a person in a respectful manner (by using the name, followed by the patronym) and to accent an informal message in formal environments, as between colleagues with good relationships at work (by using the patronym with neither the name nor the family name).

<text>The cinematographer or director of photography (sometimes shortened to DP or DOP) is the person responsible for the recording of a film, television production, music video or other live-action piece. The cinematographer is the chief of the camera and light crews working on such projects. They would normally be responsible for making artistic and technical decisions related to the image and for selecting the camera, film stock, lenses, filters, etc. The study and practice of this field are referred to as &quot;cinematography&quot;.

The cinematographer is a subordinate of the director, tasked with capturing a scene in accordance with the director&#x27;s vision. Relations between the cinematographer and director vary. In some instances, the director will allow the cinematographer complete independence, while in others, the director allows little to none, even going so far as to specify exact camera placement and lens selection. Such a level of involvement is less common when the director and cinematographer have become comfortable with each other. The director will typically convey to the cinematographer what is wanted from a scene visually and allow the cinematographer latitude in achieving that effect.

The scenes recorded by the cinematographer are passed to the film editor for editing.

==History==

In the infancy of motion pictures, the cinematographer was usually also the director and the person physically handling the camera. As the art form and technology evolved, a separation between director and camera operator emerged. With the advent of artificial lighting and faster (more light-sensitive) film stocks, in addition to technological advancements in optics, the technical aspects of cinematography necessitated a specialist in that area.

Cinematography was key during the silent movie era; with no sound apart from background music and no dialogue, the films depended on lighting, acting, and set.

The American Society of Cinematographers (ASC) was formed in 1919 in Hollywood, and was the first trade society for cinematographers. Similar societies were formed in other countries, for example the British Society of Cinematographers (BSC). Their aims include the recognition of the cinematographer&#x27;s contribution to the art and science of motion picture making.

==Societies and trade organizations==
There are a number of national associations of cinematographers that represent members (irrespective of their official titles) and are dedicated to the advancement of cinematography, including:

<text>George Alec Effinger (January 10, 1947 – April 27, 2002) was an American science fiction author, born in Cleveland, Ohio.

==Writing career==
Effinger was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on January 10, 1947. His father was a United States Navy veteran and his mother was a prostitute, and he grew up very poor.

He attended Yale University on a scholarship, but he failed organic chemistry and dropped out of the pre-med program. He moved to New York City and began writing. His first wife, Diana, sometimes babysat for Damon Knight and Kate Wilhelm, a married couple who were both science fiction writers. He joined the Clarion Writers&#x27; Workshop which they sponsored.

Effinger&#x27;s first three stories were published in the first Clarion anthology in 1971. His first published story was &quot;The Eight-Thirty to Nine Slot&quot; in &quot;Fantastic&quot; in 1971. During his early period, he also published under a variety of pseudonyms.

His first novel, &quot;What Entropy Means to Me&quot; (1972), was nominated for the Nebula Award. He achieved his greatest success with the trilogy of Marîd Audran novels set in a 22nd-century Middle East, with cybernetic implants and modules allowing individuals to change their personalities or bodies. The novels are in fact set in a thinly veiled version of the French Quarter of New Orleans. The three published novels were &quot;When Gravity Fails&quot; (1987), &quot;A Fire in the Sun&quot; (1989), and &quot;The Exile Kiss&quot; (1991); Effinger also contributed to the computer game &quot;Circuit&#x27;s Edge&quot; (1990), based on &quot;When Gravity Fails&quot;. He began a fourth Budayeen novel, &quot;Word of Night&quot;, but completed only the first two chapters. Those two chapters were reprinted in the anthology &quot;Budayeen Nights&quot; (2003) which has all of Effinger&#x27;s short material from the Marîd Audran setting.

His novelette &quot;Schrödinger&#x27;s Kitten&quot; (1988) received both the Hugo and the Nebula Award, as well as the Japanese Seiun Award. A collection of his stories was published posthumously in 2005, entitled &quot;George Alec Effinger Live! From Planet Earth&quot;; includes the complete stories Effinger wrote under the pseudonym &quot;O. Niemand&quot; and many of Effinger&#x27;s best-known stories. Each O. Niemand story is a pastiche in the voice of a different major American writer (Flannery O&#x27;Connor, Damon Runyon, Mark Twain, etc.), all set on the asteroid city of Springfield. &quot;Niemand&quot; is from the German word for &quot;nobody&quot;, and the initial O was intended by Effinger as a visual pun for Zero, and possibly also as a reference to the author O. Henry.

Other stories he wrote were the series of Maureen (Muffy) Birnbaum parodies, which placed a preppy into a variety of science fictional, fantasy, and horror scenarios.

He made brief forays into writing comic books in the early 1970s, mostly in Marvel Comics&#x27; science fiction, fantasy, and horror titles; and again in the late 1980s, including the first issue of a series of his own creation entitled &quot;Neil and Buzz in Space &amp; Time&quot;, about two fictional astronauts who travel to the edge of the universe to find it contains nothing but an ocean planet with a replica of a small New Jersey town on its only island. The first issue was the only issue, and the story ended on a cliffhanger. It was released by Fantagraphics. He also wrote a story based in the Zork universe.

==Personal life==
Effinger was known to close friends as &quot;Piglet&quot;, a nickname from his youth which he later came to dislike.

Throughout his life, Effinger suffered from health problems. These resulted in enormous medical bills which he was unable to pay, resulting in a declaration of bankruptcy. Because Louisiana&#x27;s system of law descends from the Napoleonic Code rather than English Common Law, the possibility existed that copyrights to Effinger&#x27;s works and characters might revert to his creditors, in this case the hospital. However, no representative of the hospital showed up at the bankruptcy hearing, and Effinger regained the rights to all his intellectual property.

Effinger suffered a hearing loss of about 70% due to childhood infections, only helped about the last 10 years of his life by hearing aids. He did not drive most of his life, and only got a driver&#x27;s license at about age 39 for check-cashing purposes.

Effinger met his first wife Diana in the 1960s. He was married from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s to artist Beverly K. Effinger, and from 1998 to 2000 to fellow science fiction author Barbara Hambly. He died in New Orleans, Louisiana.

&quot;Note:&quot; The titles of the first two books of the Marîd Audran series are both taken from Bob Dylan lyrics. &quot;When Gravity Fails&quot; is from the song &quot;Just Like Tom Thumb&#x27;s Blues&quot; and &quot;A Fire in the Sun&quot; from &quot;It&#x27;s All Over Now, Baby Blue&quot;. Permission was denied to use a Dylan quote for the third book&#x27;s title, so Effinger chose a public domain quote from Shakespeare.

<text>Braunschweig () or Brunswick ( ; from Low German , local dialect: ) is a city in Lower Saxony, Germany, north of the Harz Mountains at the farthest navigable point of the river Oker, which connects it to the North Sea via the rivers Aller and Weser. In 2024, it had a population of 272,417. The urban agglomeration of Braunschweig had an estimated population of 551,000 during the year 2024. Braunschweig is considered a regiopolis and is one of the largest ones in Northern Germany and the largest regiopolis in Lower Saxony. The city is seen as a major hub within the region due to it having multiple characteristics of a metropolitan city in a smaller scale or in a comparative amount to other metropolitan cities in Germany. 

The urban agglomeration of Braunschweig is the most diverse in Lower Saxony and one of the most in Germany, with almost 45% of its residents having a migration background. The city itself consists only 37.5% migrants (approx 102,000) and 75% of the Germans residing in Braunschweig come from different parts of the country, particularly North Rhine Westphalia and the East German states.

56% or 101.82 km2 of the city&#x27;s area is made up of green spaces such as parks and forests. Braunschweig has a population density of 3,017 per square kilometer excluding the green areas, only about 90 km2 of the total area is properly urban, making it quite a dense city. Many districts of the city have a density over 3,300 people per square kilometer such as Weststadt, Innenstadt, Westliches Ringgebiet, Nordstadt, or Östliches Ringgebiet. Due to the city&#x27;s limited urban core and efforts in preserving green spaces, 73% of the residents live in multi-storey apartments.

A powerful and influential centre of commerce in medieval Germany, Brunswick was a member of the Hanseatic League from the 13th until the 17th century. It was the capital city of three successive states: the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (1269–1432, 1754–1807, and 1813–1814), the Duchy of Brunswick (1814–1918), and the Free State of Brunswick (1918–1946).

Today, Brunswick is the second-largest city in Lower Saxony and a major centre of scientific research and development.

==History==

===Foundation and early history===
The date and circumstances of the town&#x27;s foundation are unknown. Tradition maintains that Brunswick was created through the merger of two settlements, one founded by Brun(o), a Saxon count who died in 880, on one side of the River Oker – the legend gives the year 861 for the foundation – and the other the settlement of a legendary Count Dankward, after whom Dankwarderode Castle (the &quot;Castle of Dankward&#x27;s clearing&quot;), which was reconstructed in the 19th century, is named.

The town&#x27;s original name of &quot;Brunswik&quot; may be a combination of the name Bruno and Low German &quot;wik&quot; (related to the Latin &quot;vicus&quot;), a place where merchants rested and stored their goods. The town&#x27;s name, therefore, may indicate a resting place, consistent with its location by a ford across the Oker River. An alternative explanation of the city&#x27;s name is that it comes from &quot;Brand&quot;, or burning, indicating a place which developed after the landscape was cleared through burning. The city was first mentioned in documents from the St. Magni Church from 1031, which give the city&#x27;s name as &quot;Brunesguik&quot;.

===Middle Ages and early modern period===
Up to the 12th century, Brunswick was ruled by the Saxon noble family of the Brunonids; then, through marriage, the town fell to the House of Welf. In 1142, Henry the Lion of the House of Welf became duke of Saxony and made Braunschweig the capital of his state (which, from 1156 on, also included the Duchy of Bavaria). He turned Dankwarderode Castle, the residence of the counts of Brunswick, into his own &quot;Pfalz&quot; and developed the city further to represent his authority. Under Henry&#x27;s rule, the Cathedral of St. Blasius was built and he also had the statue of a lion, his heraldic animal, erected in front of the castle. The lion subsequently became the city&#x27;s landmark.

Henry the Lion became so powerful that he dared to refuse military aid to the Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa, which led to his banishment in 1182. Henry went into exile in England. He had previously established ties to the English crown in 1168, through his marriage to King Henry II of England&#x27;s daughter Matilda, sister of Richard the Lionheart. However, Henry&#x27;s son Otto, who regained influence and was eventually crowned Holy Roman Emperor, continued to foster the city&#x27;s development.

During the Middle Ages, Brunswick was an important center of trade, one of the economic and political centers in Northern Europe and a member of the Hanseatic League from the 13th century to the middle of the 17th century. By the year 1600, Brunswick was the seventh largest city in Germany. Although formally one of the residences of the rulers of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg, a constituent state of the Holy Roman Empire, Brunswick was &quot;de facto&quot; ruled independently by a powerful class of patricians and the guilds throughout much of the Late Middle Ages and the Early modern period. Because of the growing power of Brunswick&#x27;s burghers, the Princes of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, who ruled over one of the subdivisions of Brunswick-Lüneburg, finally moved their &quot;Residenz&quot; out of the city and to the nearby town of Wolfenbüttel in 1432. The Princes of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel did not regain control over the city until the late 17th century, when Rudolph Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, took the city by siege.

In the 18th century Brunswick was not only a political, but also a cultural centre. Influenced by the philosophy of the Enlightenment, dukes like Anthony Ulrich and Charles I became patrons of the arts and sciences. In 1745, Charles I founded the &quot;Collegium Carolinum&quot;, predecessor of the Brunswick University of Technology, and in 1753 he moved the ducal residence back to Brunswick. With this he attracted poets and thinkers such as Lessing, Leisewitz, and Jakob Mauvillon to his court and the city. &quot;Emilia Galotti&quot; by Lessing and Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; were performed for the first time in Brunswick.

===19th century===

In 1806, the city was captured by the French during the Napoleonic Wars and became part of the short-lived Napoleonic Kingdom of Westphalia in 1807. The exiled Duke Frederick William raised a volunteer corps, the Black Brunswickers, who fought the French in several battles.

After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Brunswick was made capital of the re-established independent Duchy of Brunswick, later a constituent state of the German Empire from 1871. In the aftermath of the July Revolution in 1830, in Brunswick duke Charles II was forced to abdicate. His absolutist governing style had previously alienated the nobility and bourgeoisie, while the lower classes were disaffected by the bad economic situation. During the night of 7–8 September 1830, the ducal palace in Brunswick was stormed by an angry mob, set on fire, and destroyed completely. Charles was succeeded by his brother William VIII. During William&#x27;s reign, liberal reforms were made and Brunswick&#x27;s parliament was strengthened.

During the 19th century, industrialisation caused a rapid growth of population in the city, eventually causing Brunswick to be for the first time significantly enlarged beyond its medieval fortifications and the River Oker. On 1 December 1838, the first section of the Brunswick–Bad Harzburg railway line connecting Brunswick and Wolfenbüttel opened as the first railway line in Northern Germany, operated by the Duchy of Brunswick State Railway.

===Early to mid-20th century===

On 8 November 1918, at the end of World War I, a socialist workers&#x27; council forced Duke Ernest Augustus to abdicate. On 10 November, the council proclaimed the Socialist Republic of Brunswick under one-party government by the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD); however, the subsequent &quot;Landtag&quot; election on 22 December 1918 was won by the Majority Social Democratic Party of Germany (MSPD), and the USPD and MSPD formed a coalition government. An uprising in Braunschweig in 1919, led by the communist Spartacus League, was defeated when &quot;Freikorps&quot; troops under Georg Ludwig Rudolf Maercker took over the city on order of the German Minister of Defence, Gustav Noske. An MSPD-led government was subsequently established; in December 1921, a new constitution was approved for the Free State of Brunswick, now a parliamentary republic within the Weimar Republic, again with Braunschweig as its capital.

After the &quot;Landtag&quot; election of 1930, Brunswick became the second state in Germany where the Nazis participated in government, when the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party (NSDAP) formed a coalition government with several conservative and right-wing parties. With the support of Dietrich Klagges, Brunswick&#x27;s minister of the interior, the NSDAP organized a large SA rally in Braunschweig. On 17–18 October 1931, 100,000 SA stormtroopers marched through the city; street fights between Nazis, socialists, and communists left several dead or injured. On 25 February 1932, the state of Brunswick granted Adolf Hitler German citizenship to allow him to run in the 1932 German presidential election. In Braunschweig, Nazis carried out several attacks on political enemies, with the acquiescence of the state government.

After the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, several state institutions were placed in Braunschweig, including the &quot;Luftfahrtforschungsanstalt&quot; in Völkenrode, the Hitler Youth Academy for Youth Leadership, and the SS-Junkerschule Braunschweig. With the Reichswerke Hermann Göring in Salzgitter and the Stadt des KdF-Wagens, as well as several factories in the city itself (including Büssing and the Volkswagenwerk Braunschweig), the Braunschweig region became one of the centres of the German arms industry.

During the Second World War, Braunschweig was a sub-area headquarters of Wehrkreis XI (one of Germany&#x27;s military districts), and was the garrison city of the 31st Infantry Division that took part in the invasions of Poland, Belgium, and France, largely being destroyed during its retreat following the invasion of Russia. In this period, thousands of Eastern workers were brought to the city as forced labor, and in the 1943–1945 period at least 360 children taken away from such workers died in the &quot;Entbindungsheim für Ostarbeiterinnen&quot; (&quot;Maternity Ward for Eastern Workers&quot;).

In 1944, two subcamps of the Neuengamme concentration camp were established in Braunschweig. The subcamp &quot;Schillstraße&quot; or &quot;Büssing-NAG/Schillstraße&quot;, located where the BraWo Park&#x27;s parking lot is today, held about 800 male prisoners, who were forced to work in the arms production at Büssing-NAG. After about 300 had died due to disease, hunger, and maltreatment over the course of just a few months, a further 200 were transferred to the infirmary of a nearby subcamp in early January 1945 in order to reduce the number of deaths. However, this was only effective to some degree, as another 80 bodies landed in the city&#x27;s crematory until the subcamp&#x27;s closing in March 1945, when Büssing-NAG had to halt production due to severe bombing damages. Today the &quot;Gedenkstätte Schillstraße,&quot; located very close to the former premises of the subcamp, documents Braunschweig&#x27;s history during the Third Reich. Büssing-NAG also had another subcamp in the nearby Vechelde, which held a further 400 male prisoners.

The subcamp &quot;SS-Reitschule&quot;, named so as it was located on the former premises of the SS-Junker School&#x27;s riding school, held approximately 800 prisoners, all female, who were tasked with clearing away rubble. This subcamp was commissioned by the city of Braunschweig. Although it was only open for two months - from December 1944 until February 1945, there were at least 17 deaths and a transfer of about 50 prisoners to a nearby subcamp&#x27;s infirmary. The number of survivors is unknown.

Piera Sonnino (1922–1999), an Italian author, writes of her imprisonment in Braunschweig in her book, &quot;This Has Happened&quot;, published in English in 2006 by MacMillan Palgrave.

The Allied air raid on October 15, 1944, destroyed most of the city&#x27;s churches, and the &quot;Altstadt&quot; (old town), the largest homogeneous ensemble of half-timbered houses in Germany. 100 out of 800 half-timbered houses survived as well as the most important places and streets, preserved in 5 areas of the old town.

The city&#x27;s cathedral, which had been converted to a &quot;Nationale Weihestätte&quot; (national shrine) by the Nazi government, still stood.

===Postwar period to the 21st century===
About 10% of the inner city survived Allied bombing and remain to represent its distinctive architecture. The cathedral was restored to its function as a Protestant church. Outside the old town city centre large historic quarters remain like Östliches Ringgebiet with its Gründerzeit architecture.

Politically, after the war, the Free State of Brunswick was dissolved by the Allied occupying authorities, Braunschweig ceased to be a capital, and most of its lands were incorporated in the newly formed state of Lower Saxony.

During the Cold War, Braunschweig, then part of West Germany, suffered economically due to its proximity to the Iron Curtain. The city lost its historically strong economic ties to what was then East Germany; for decades, economic growth remained, on average, below the rest of the country while unemployment was above-average for West Germany.

On 28 February 1974, as part of a district reform in Lower Saxony, the rural district of Braunschweig, which had surrounded the city, was disestablished. The major part of the former district was incorporated into the city of Braunschweig, increasing its population by roughly 52,000 people.

In the 1990s, efforts increased to reconstruct historic buildings that had been destroyed in the air raid. The façade of the &quot;Braunschweiger Schloss&quot; was rebuilt, and buildings such as the &quot;Alte Waage&quot; (originally built in 1534) now stand again.

==Population==
Braunschweig has a population of 272,000 and is the 2nd largest city in Lower Saxony. Braunschweig is considered as one of the oldest cities in Germany, founded in 1031 by Henry the Lion. Braunschweig first reached its peak of over 100,000 in 1890. In the 1960s and 1970s industrialization boomed in Braunschweig due to automobile and other companies coming to Braunschweig and surrounding cities like Wolfsburg and Salzgitter. Braunschweig&#x27;s population reached its highest peak of population in 1975 with population of about 273,000 and is expected to exceed this count during the year 2025 and other years. Braunschweig&#x27;s population started to decline in the 1980s. In the 1990s - after the German reunification - it began to grow again as many East Germans moved there due to its close proximity to former East Germany, 75% of the Germans living in Braunschweig come from different parts of Germany; most are from Former East Germany, Hessen and North Rhine Westphalia. Currently, Braunschweig has a strong focus on research and development. According to 2019 data, it has the highest R&amp;D intensity (ratio of R&amp;D expenditure to GDP) in the entire EU and over 4% of all employed people are R&amp;D personnel.

===Religion===
In 2015, 91,785 people (or 36.3% of the population) were Protestant and 34,604 (13.7%) people were Roman Catholic; 126,379 people (50.0%) either adhered to other denominations or followed no religion.

===Islam===
Roughly 17,000 Muslims (6.2% of the population)
live in Braunschweig. Mosques like DMK Moschee, Fatih Moschee Braunschweig and cultural clubs are present throughout the city but mosque buildings with minerates have not been built in Braunschweig but can be seen in its urban area for example the Grüne Moschee in Wolfenbüttel, Fatih Moschee Salzgitter and the Albanischer-Kulturverein in Gifhorn.

===Immigration===
A total of 101,399 of Braunschweig&#x27;s residents, including citizens with second passport, had a migration background in 2024 (37.2% of the total population). Weststadt has the highest migration percentage being 63.2%, followed by Nordstadt Braunschweig with 55.8%, Westliches Ringgebiet with 52.4% and Innenstadt with 49.6%. Majority of the ethnic groups come from Asia, Africa and Eastern European nations. Among those, 47,946 were Non-German citizens (17.6%); the following table lists up the largest minority groups, including citizens with a migration background from a specific nation or region:

===Urban Agglomeration===
The urban agglomeration area of Braunschweig is approximately 551,000 in 2024, making it one of the largest regiopolis in Germany and the largest one in Lower Saxony. This area includes Wolfenbüttel, Meine, northern parts of Salzgitter, Weddel, Sickte, Timmerlah, Lengede and other towns and regions within a 15 kilometer radius. Braunschweig&#x27;s urban area makes it a bigger city compared to others with a similar size e.g. Aachen, Wiesbaden or Gelsenkirchen, and since the urban area is not significantly smaller than Hanover, it makes itself an important and major city in Lower Saxony. Companies like New Yorker, Salzgitter AG, Jägermeister, Siemens, Bosch, Volkswagen, Nordzucker, Continental, and others are headquartered or have a branch in this area.

Information about the Urban Agglomeration in 2024:

Population: 551,328

Area size: 309.2 km2 (without green space and water bodies)

Population Density: 1,783 people per square kilometer

Migration background percentage: 44.8%

Largest cities, districts and towns: Braunschweig, Salzgitter, Kreis Wolfenbüttel, Lehre, Kreis Cremlingen, Kreis Gifhorn, Vechelde, Lengede

Population of the areas within the urban agglomeration of Braunschweig(estimate):

Braunschweig- 272,000

Salzgitter- 76,500

Wolfenbüttel- 53,000

Gifhorn Kreis - 62 000

Wolfenbüttel Kreis - 47 000

Peine Kreis - 41 500

The population of the urban aggomeration with a migration background is 246,995 in 2024 which makes up almost 45% of the population.
 This makes the agglomeration one of the most diverse in Germany and the most in Lower Saxony. Over 75% of the Germans in the urban agglomeration come from different parts of Germany with most of them coming from eastern States due to the proximity. The city is unique because unlike most cities with migrant populations concentrated inside the city itself, higher number of migrant populations are also found in surrounding areas. Braunschweig&#x27;s urban agglomeration has a higher migration percentage compared to its city due to industrialization and other major factors since 2011. One of the largest Chinese, Cameroonian, Russian, Polish and Tunisian communities in Germany are located in the surroundings and within Braunschweig.

These are the biggest groups of nationalities in the urban aggomeration (these include the citizens with a migration background and a second passport):

==Transport==

Braunschweig&#x27;s city centre is mostly a car-free pedestrian zone.

===Road===
Two main autobahns serve Braunschweig, the A2 (Berlin—Hanover—Dortmund) and the A39 (Salzgitter—Wolfsburg). City roads are generally wide, as they were built after World War II to support the anticipated use of the car. There are several car parks in the city.

===Bicycle===
Many residents travel around town by bicycle using an extensive system of bicycle-only lanes. The main train station includes a bicycle parking area.

===Train===
The city is on the main rail line between Frankfurt and Berlin, as well as a small hub on a few South- and North-bound branches to Bad Harzburg; Salzgitter; Gifhorn and two electrified 2 track branch towards Lehrte (and the Hannover-Berlin mainline), and towards Wolfsburg linking to the same mainline.
Around 120,000 people use the main station daily.

Deutsche Bahn (German Railways, with their DB Regio Subsidiary) serves the city with a few local services, although Errix towards Uelzen (Northwards) and Bad Harzburg (Southwards) operate the aforementioned directions, as well as Hildesheim and Wolfsburg (West-East respectively) trains having been handed to Enno, and the RE70 service to Hannover being run by the Westfalenbahn.

==Name==
Many other geographical locations around the world are named Brunswick, after the historical English name of Braunschweig. Between 1714 and 1837, the House of Hanover ruled Great Britain in personal union with the Electorate of Hanover. The House of Hanover was formally known as the House of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Hanover line. As a result, many places in the British colonies were named after Brunswick, such as the province of New Brunswick in Canada.

Ironically, the city of Braunschweig was not ruled by the Hanoverians while its name was being given to other Brunswicks around the world. Starting in 1269, the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg underwent a series of divisions and mergers, with parts of the territory being transferred between various branches of the family. The city of Braunschweig went to the senior branch of the house, the Wolfenbüttel line, while Lüneburg eventually ended up with the Hanover line. Although the territory had been split, all branches of the family continued to style themselves as the House of Brunswick-Lüneburg. In 1884, the senior branch of the House of Welf became extinct. The Hanover line, being the last surviving line of the family, subsequently held the throne of the Duchy of Brunswick from November 1913 until November 1918.

==Government offices==
The offices of the Luftfahrt-Bundesamt (LBA, &quot;Federal Aviation Office&quot;) and the German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation (BFU) are located in Braunschweig.

The PTB Braunschweig maintains the atomic clock responsible for the DCF77 time signal and the official German time. In 2006 the region of Braunschweig was the most R&amp;D-intensive area in the whole European Economic Area, investing 7.1% of its GDP for research &amp; technology. In 2019, the figure had risen to 7.79%, making Braunschweig retain its ranking as the most R&amp;D-intensive region in Germany. In 2007 Braunschweig was presented the City of Science award by the Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft.

<text>The prohibition of drugs through sumptuary legislation or religious law is a common means of attempting to prevent the recreational use of certain intoxicating substances.

An area has a prohibition of drugs when its government uses the force of law to punish the use or possession of drugs which have been classified as controlled. A government may simultaneously have systems in place to regulate both controlled and non controlled drugs. Regulation controls the manufacture, distribution, marketing, sale, and use of certain drugs, for instance through a prescription system. For example, in some states, the possession or sale of amphetamines is a crime unless a patient has a physician&#x27;s prescription for the drug; having a prescription authorizes a pharmacy to sell and a patient to use a drug that would otherwise be prohibited. Although prohibition mostly concerns psychoactive drugs (which affect mental processes such as perception, cognition, and mood), prohibition can also apply to non-psychoactive drugs, such as anabolic steroids. Many governments do not criminalize the possession of a limited quantity of certain drugs for personal use, while still prohibiting their sale or manufacture, or possession in large quantities. Some laws (or judicial practice) set a specific volume of a particular drug, above which is considered &quot;ipso jure&quot; to be evidence of trafficking or sale of the drug.

Some Islamic countries prohibit the use of alcohol (see list of countries with alcohol prohibition). Many governments levy a tax on alcohol and tobacco products, and restrict alcohol and tobacco from being sold or gifted to a minor. Other common restrictions include bans on outdoor drinking and indoor smoking. In the early 20th century, many countries had alcohol prohibition. These include the United States (1920–1933), Finland (1919–1932), Norway (1916–1927), Canada (1901–1948), Iceland (1915–1922) and the Russian Empire/USSR (1914–1925). In fact, the first international treaty to control a psychoactive substance adopted in 1890 actually concerned alcoholic beverages (Brussels Conference). The first treaty on opium only arrived two decades later, in 1912.

== Definitions ==
&quot;Drugs&quot;, in the context of &quot;prohibition,&quot; are any of a number of psychoactive substances whose use a government or religious body seeks to control. What constitutes a &quot;drug&quot; varies by century and belief system. What is a psychoactive substance is relatively well known to modern science. Examples include a range from caffeine found in coffee, tea, and chocolate, nicotine in tobacco products; botanical extracts morphine and heroin, and synthetic compounds MDMA and fentanyl. Almost without exception, these substances also have a medical use, in which case they are called pharmaceutical drugs or just &quot;pharmaceuticals.&quot; The use of medicine to save or extend life or to alleviate suffering is uncontroversial in most cultures. &quot;Prohibition&quot; applies to certain conditions of possession or use. &quot;Recreational use&quot; refers to the use of substances primarily for their psychoactive effect outside of a clinical situation or doctor&#x27;s care.

In the twenty-first century, caffeine has pharmaceutical uses. Caffeine is used to treat bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In most cultures, caffeine in the form of coffee or tea is unregulated. Over 2.25 billion cups of coffee are consumed in the world every day. Some religions, including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, prohibit coffee. They believe that it is both physically and spiritually unhealthy to consume coffee.

A government&#x27;s interest to control a drug may be based on its negative effects on its users, or it may simply have a revenue interest. The British parliament prohibited the possession of untaxed tea with the imposition of the Tea Act of 1773. In this case, as in many others, it is not a substance that is prohibited, but the conditions under which it is possessed or consumed. Those conditions include matters of intent, which makes the enforcement of laws difficult. In Colorado possession of &quot;blenders, bowls, containers, spoons, and mixing devices&quot; is illegal if there was &quot;intent&quot; to use them with drugs.

Many drugs, beyond their pharmaceutical and recreational uses, have industrial uses. Nitrous oxide, or &quot;laughing gas&quot; is a dental anesthetic, also used to prepare whipped cream, fuel rocket engines, and enhance the performance of race cars. Ethanol, or drinking alcohol, is also used as a fuel, industrial solvent and disinfectant.

==History==
The cultivation, use, and trade of psychoactive and other drugs has occurred since ancient times. Concurrently, authorities have often restricted drug possession and trade for a variety of political and religious reasons. In the 20th century, the United States led a major renewed surge in drug prohibition called the &quot;War on Drugs&quot;.

===Early drug laws===

The prohibition on alcohol under Islamic &quot;Sharia&quot; law, which is usually attributed to passages in the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot;, dates back to the early seventh century. Although Islamic law is often interpreted as prohibiting all intoxicants (not only alcohol), the ancient practice of hashish smoking has continued throughout the history of Islam, against varying degrees of resistance. A major campaign against hashish-eating Sufis were conducted in Egypt in the 11th and 12th centuries resulting among other things in the burning of fields of cannabis.

Though the prohibition of illegal drugs was established under Sharia law, particularly against the use of hashish as a recreational drug, classical jurists of medieval Islamic jurisprudence accepted the use of hashish for medicinal and therapeutic purposes, and agreed that its &quot;medical use, even if it leads to mental derangement, should remain exempt [from punishment]&quot;. In the 14th century, the Islamic scholar Az-Zarkashi spoke of &quot;the permissibility of its use for medical purposes if it is established that it is beneficial&quot;.
In the Ottoman Empire, Murad IV attempted to prohibit coffee drinking to Muslims as &quot;haraam&quot;, arguing that it was an intoxicant, but this ruling was overturned soon after he died in 1640. The introduction of coffee in Europe from Muslim Turkey prompted calls for it to be banned as the devil&#x27;s work, although Pope Clement VIII sanctioned its use in 1600, declaring that it was &quot;so delicious that it would be a pity to let the infidels have exclusive use of it&quot;. Bach&#x27;s Coffee Cantata, from the 1730s, presents a vigorous debate between a girl and her father over her desire to consume coffee. The early association between coffeehouses and seditious political activities in England led to the banning of such establishments in the mid-17th century.

A number of Asian rulers had similarly enacted early prohibitions, many of which were later forcefully overturned by Western colonial powers during the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1360, for example, King Ramathibodi I, of Ayutthaya Kingdom (now Thailand), prohibited opium consumption and trade. The prohibition lasted nearly 500 years until 1851 when King Rama IV allowed Chinese migrants to consume opium. The Konbaung Dynasty prohibited all intoxicants and stimulants during the reign of King Bodawpaya (1781–1819). After Burma became a British colony, the restrictions on opium were abolished and the colonial government established monopolies selling Indian-produced opium.

In late Qing China, opium imported by foreign traders, such as those employed by Jardine Matheson and the East India Company, was consumed by all social classes in Southern China. Between 1821 and 1837, imports of the drug increased fivefold. The wealth drain and widespread social problems that resulted from this consumption prompted the Chinese government to attempt to end the trade. This effort was initially successful, with Lin Zexu ordering the destruction of opium at Humen in June 1839. However, the opium traders lobbied the British government to declare war on China, resulting in the First Opium War. The Qing government was defeated and the war ended with the Treaty of Nanking, which legalized opium trading in Chinese law

===First modern drug regulations===

The first modern law in Europe for the regulating of drugs was the Pharmacy Act 1868 in the United Kingdom. There had been previous moves to establish the medical and pharmaceutical professions as separate, self-regulating bodies, but the General Medical Council, established in 1863, unsuccessfully attempted to assert control over drug distribution. The Act set controls on the distribution of poisons and drugs. Poisons could only be sold if the purchaser was known to the seller or to an intermediary known to both, and drugs, including opium and all preparations of opium or of poppies, had to be sold in containers with the seller&#x27;s name and address.
Despite the reservation of opium to professional control, general sales did continue to a limited extent, with mixtures with less than 1 percent opium being unregulated.

After the legislation passed, the death rate caused by opium immediately fell from 6.4 per million population in 1868 to 4.5 in 1869. Deaths among children under five dropped from 20.5 per million population between 1863 and 1867 to 12.7 per million in 1871 and further declined to between 6 and 7 per million in the 1880s.

In the United States, the first drug law was passed in San Francisco in 1875, banning the smoking of opium in opium dens. The reason cited was &quot;many women and young girls, as well as young men of a respectable family, were being induced to visit the Chinese opium-smoking dens, where they were ruined morally and otherwise.&quot; This was followed by other laws throughout the country, and federal laws that barred Chinese people from trafficking in opium. Though the laws affected the use and distribution of opium by Chinese immigrants, no action was taken against the producers of such products as laudanum, a tincture of opium and alcohol, commonly taken as a panacea by white Americans. The distinction between its use by white Americans and Chinese immigrants was thus a form of racial discrimination as it was based on the form in which it was ingested: Chinese immigrants tended to smoke it, while it was often included in various kinds of generally liquid medicines often (but not exclusively) used by Americans of European descent. The laws targeted opium smoking, but not other methods of ingestion.

Britain passed the All-India Opium Act of 1878, which limited recreational opium sales to registered Indian opium-eaters and Chinese opium-smokers and prohibiting its sale to emigrant workers from British Burma.

Following the passage of a regional law in 1895, Australia&#x27;s 1897 Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act addressed opium addiction among Aborigines, though it soon became a general vehicle for depriving them of basic rights by administrative regulation. Opium sale was prohibited to the general population in 1905, and smoking and possession were prohibited in 1908.

Despite these laws, the late 19th century saw an increase in opiate consumption. This was due to the prescribing and dispensing of legal opiates by physicians and pharmacists to relieve menstruation pain. It is estimated that between 150,000 and 200,000 opiate addicts lived in the United States at the time, and a majority of these addicts were women.

===Changing attitudes and the drug prohibition campaign===
Foreign traders, including those employed by Jardine Matheson and the East India Company, smuggled opium into China in order to balance high trade deficits. Chinese attempts to outlaw the trade led to the First Opium War and the subsequent legalization of the trade at the Treaty of Nanking. Attitudes towards the opium trade were initially ambivalent, but in 1874 the Society for the Suppression of the Opium Trade was formed in England by Quakers led by the Rev. Frederick Storrs-Turner. By the 1890s, increasingly strident campaigns were waged by Protestant missionaries in China for its abolition. The first such society was established at the 1890 Shanghai Missionary Conference, where British and American representatives, including John Glasgow Kerr, Arthur E. Moule, Arthur Gostick Shorrock and Griffith John, agreed to establish the Permanent Committee for the Promotion of Anti-Opium Societies.

Due to increasing pressure in the British parliament, the Liberal government under William Ewart Gladstone approved the appointment of a Royal Commission on Opium to India in 1893. The commission was tasked with ascertaining the impact of Indian opium exports to the Far East, and to advise whether the trade should be banned and opium consumption itself banned in India. After an extended inquiry, the Royal Commission rejected the claims made by the anti-opium campaigners regarding the supposed societal harm caused by the trade and the issue was finalized for another 15 years.

The missionary organizations were outraged over the Royal Commission on Opium&#x27;s conclusions and set up the Anti-Opium League in China; the league gathered data from every Western-trained medical doctor in China and published &quot;Opinions of Over 100 Physicians on the Use of Opium in China&quot;. This was the first anti-drug campaign to be based on scientific principles, and it had a tremendous impact on the state of educated opinion in the West. In England, the home director of the China Inland Mission, Benjamin Broomhall, was an active opponent of the opium trade, writing two books to promote the banning of opium smoking: &quot;The Truth about Opium Smoking&quot; and &quot;The Chinese Opium Smoker&quot;. In 1888, Broomhall formed and became secretary of the Christian Union for the Severance of the British Empire with the Opium Traffic and editor of its periodical, &quot;National Righteousness&quot;. He lobbied the British parliament to ban the opium trade. Broomhall and James Laidlaw Maxwell appealed to the London Missionary Conference of 1888 and the Edinburgh Missionary Conference of 1910 to condemn the continuation of the trade. As Broomhall lay dying, an article from &quot;The Times&quot; was read to him with the welcome news that an international agreement had been signed ensuring the end of the opium trade within two years.

In 1906, a motion to &#x27;declare the opium trade &quot;morally indefensible&quot; and remove Government support for it&#x27;, initially unsuccessfully proposed by Arthur Pease in 1891, was put before the House of Commons. This time the motion passed. The Qing government banned opium soon afterward.

These changing attitudes led to the founding of the International Opium Commission in 1909. An International Opium Convention was signed by 13 nations at The Hague on January 23, 1912, during the First International Opium Conference. This was the first international drug control treaty and it was registered in the &quot;League of Nations Treaty Series&quot; on January 23, 1922. The Convention provided that &quot;The contracting Powers shall use their best endeavors to control or to cause to be controlled, all person manufacturing, importing, selling, distributing, and exporting morphine, cocaine, and their respective salts, as well as the buildings in which these persons carry such an industry or trade.&quot;

The treaty became international law in 1919 when it was incorporated into the Treaty of Versailles. The role of the commission was passed to the League of Nations, and all signatory nations agreed to prohibit the import, sale, distribution, export, and use of all narcotic drugs, except for medical and scientific purposes.

===Prohibition===
In the UK the Defence of the Realm Act 1914, passed at the onset of the First World War, gave the government wide-ranging powers to requisition the property and to criminalize specific activities. A moral panic was whipped up by the press in 1916 over the alleged sale of drugs to the troops of the British Indian Army. With the temporary powers of DORA, the Army Council quickly banned the sale of all psychoactive drugs to troops, unless required for medical reasons. However, shifts in the public attitude towards drugs—they were beginning to be associated with prostitution, vice and immorality—led the government to pass further unprecedented laws, banning and criminalising the possession and dispensation of all narcotics, including opium and cocaine. After the war, this legislation was maintained and strengthened with the passing of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1920 (10 &amp; 11 Geo. 5. c. 46). Home Office control was extended to include raw opium, morphine, cocaine, ecogonine and heroin.

Hardening of Canadian attitudes toward Chinese-Canadian opium users and fear of a spread of the drug into the white population led to the effective criminalization of opium for nonmedical use in Canada between 1908 and the mid-1920s.

The Mao Zedong government nearly eradicated both consumption and production of opium during the 1950s using social control and isolation. Ten million addicts were forced into compulsory treatment, dealers were executed, and opium-producing regions were planted with new crops. Remaining opium production shifted south of the Chinese border into the Golden Triangle region. The remnant opium trade primarily served Southeast Asia, but spread to American soldiers during the Vietnam War, with 20 percent of soldiers regarding themselves as addicted during the peak of the epidemic in 1971. In 2003, China was estimated to have four million regular drug users and one million registered drug addicts.

In the US, the Harrison Act was passed in 1914, and required sellers of opiates and cocaine to get a license. While originally intended to regulate the trade, it soon became a prohibitive law, eventually becoming legal precedent that any prescription for a narcotic given by a physician or pharmacist – even in the course of medical treatment for addiction – constituted conspiracy to violate the Harrison Act. In 1919, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Doremus&quot; that the Harrison Act was constitutional and in &quot;Webb&quot; that physicians could not prescribe narcotics solely for maintenance. In &quot;Jin Fuey Moy v. United States&quot;, the court upheld that it was a violation of the Harrison Act even if a physician provided prescription of a narcotic for an addict, and thus subject to criminal prosecution. This is also true of the later Marijuana Tax Act in 1937. Soon, however, licensing bodies did not issue licenses, effectively banning the drugs.

The American judicial system did not initially accept drug prohibition. Prosecutors argued that possessing drugs was a tax violation, as no legal licenses to sell drugs were in existence; hence, a person possessing drugs must have purchased them from an unlicensed source. After some wrangling, this was accepted as federal jurisdiction under the interstate commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution.

====Alcohol prohibition====

The prohibition of alcohol commenced in Finland in 1919 and in the United States in 1920. Because alcohol was the most popular recreational drug in these countries, reactions to its prohibition were far more negative than to the prohibition of other drugs, which were commonly associated with ethnic minorities, prostitution, and vice. Public pressure led to the repeal of alcohol prohibition in Finland in 1932, and in the United States in 1933. Residents of many provinces of Canada also experienced alcohol prohibition for similar periods in the first half of the 20th century.

In Sweden, a referendum in 1922 decided against an alcohol prohibition law (with 51% of the votes against and 49% for prohibition), but starting in 1914 (nationwide from 1917) and until 1955 Sweden employed an alcohol rationing system with personal liquor ration books (&quot;motbok&quot;).

===War on Drugs===


In response to rising drug use among young people and the counterculture movement, government efforts to enforce prohibition were strengthened in many countries from the 1960s onward. Support at an international level for the prohibition of psychoactive drug use became a consistent feature of United States policy during both Republican and Democratic administrations, to such an extent that US support for foreign governments has often been contingent on their adherence to US drug policy. Major milestones in this campaign include the introduction of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs in 1961, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances in 1971 and the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances in 1988. A few developing countries where consumption of the prohibited substances has enjoyed longstanding cultural support, long resisted such outside pressure to pass legislation adhering to these conventions. Nepal only did so in 1976.

In 1972, United States President Richard Nixon announced the commencement of the so-called &quot;War on Drugs&quot;. Later, President Reagan added the position of drug czar to the President&#x27;s Executive Office. In 1973, New York introduced mandatory minimum sentences of 15 years to life imprisonment for possession of more than of a so-called hard drug, called the Rockefeller drug laws after New York Governor and later Vice President Nelson Rockefeller. Similar laws were introduced across the United States.

California&#x27;s broader &#x27;three strikes and you&#x27;re out&#x27; policy adopted in 1994 was the first mandatory sentencing policy to gain widespread publicity and was subsequently adopted in most United States jurisdictions. This policy mandates life imprisonment for a third criminal conviction of any felony offense. A similar &#x27;three strikes&#x27; policy was introduced to the United Kingdom by the Conservative government in 1997. This legislation enacted a mandatory minimum sentence of seven years for those convicted for a third time of a drug trafficking offense involving a class A drug.

===Calls for legalization, relegalization or decriminalization===

The terms relegalization, legalization, legal regulations, or decriminalization are used with very different meanings by different authors, something that can be confusing when the claims are not specified. Here are some variants:

* Sales of one or more drugs (e.g., marijuana) for personal use become legal, at least if sold in a certain way.
* Sales of an extracts with a specific substance become legal sold in a certain way, for example on prescription. 
* Use or possession of small amounts for personal use do not lead to incarceration if it is the only crime, but it is still illegal; the court or the prosecutor can impose a fine. (In that sense, Sweden both legalized and supported drug prohibition simultaneously.) 
* Use or possession of small amounts for personal use do not lead to incarceration. The case is not treated in an ordinary court, but by a commission that may recommend treatment or sanctions including fines. (In that sense, Portugal both legalized and supported drug prohibitions).

There are efforts around the world to promote the relegalization and decriminalization of drugs. These policies are often supported by proponents of liberalism and libertarianism on the grounds of individual freedom, as well as by leftists who believe prohibition to be a method of suppression of the working class by the ruling class. 

Prohibition of drugs is supported by proponents of conservatism as well various NGOs. A number of NGOs are aligned in support of drug prohibition as members of the World Federation Against Drugs. In the WFAD constitution, the &quot;Declaration of the World Forum Against Drugs&quot; (2008) advocates for &quot;no other goal than a drug-free world&quot;, and states that a balanced policy of drug abuse prevention, education, treatment, law enforcement, research, and supply reduction provides the most effective platform to reduce drug abuse and its associated harms and calls on governments to consider demand reduction as one of their first priorities. It supports the UN drug conventions, the inclusion of cannabis as one of the &quot;hard drugs&quot;, and the use of criminal sanctions &quot;when appropriate&quot; to deter drug use. It opposes legalization in any form, and harm reduction in general.

According to some critics, drug prohibition is responsible for enriching &quot;organised criminal networks&quot; while the hypothesis that the prohibition of drugs generates violence is consistent with research done over long time-series and cross-country facts.

In the United Kingdom, where the principal piece of drug prohibition legislation is the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, criticism includes:

* &quot;Drug classification: making a hash of it?&quot;, Fifth Report of Session 2005–06, House of Commons Science and Technology Committee, which said that the present system of drug classification is based on historical assumptions, not scientific assessment
* &quot;Development of a rational scale to assess the harm of drugs of potential misuse&quot;, David Nutt, Leslie A. King, William Saulsbury, Colin Blakemore, The Lancet, 24 March 2007, said the act is &quot;not fit for purpose&quot; and &quot;the exclusion of alcohol and tobacco from the Misuse of Drugs Act is, from a scientific perspective, arbitrary&quot;
* The &quot;Drug Equality Alliance (DEA)&quot; argue that the Government is administering the Act arbitrarily, contrary to its purpose, contrary to the original wishes of Parliament and therefore illegally. They are currently assisting and supporting several legal challenges to this alleged maladministration.
In February 2008 the then-president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, called on the world to legalize drugs, in order, he said, to prevent the majority of violent murders occurring in Honduras. Honduras is used by cocaine smugglers as a transiting point between Colombia and the US. Honduras, with a population of 7 million, suffers an average of 8–10 murders a day, with an estimated 70% being a result of this international drug trade. The same problem is occurring in Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Mexico, according to Zelaya. In January 2012 Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos made a plea to the United States and Europe to start a global debate about legalizing drugs. This call was echoed by the Guatemalan President Otto Pérez Molina, who announced his desire to legalize drugs, saying &quot;What I have done is put the issue back on the table.&quot;

In a report dealing with HIV in June 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) of the UN called for the decriminalization of drugs particularly including injected ones. This conclusion put WHO at odds with broader long-standing UN policy favoring criminalization. Eight states of the United States (Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington), as well as the District of Columbia, have legalized the sale of marijuana for personal recreational use as of 2017, although recreational use remains illegal under U.S. federal law. The conflict between state and federal law is, as of 2018, unresolved.

Since Uruguay in 2014 and Canada in 2018 legalized cannabis, the debate has known a new turn internationally.

==Drug prohibition laws==
The following individual drugs, listed under their respective family groups (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opiates), are the most frequently sought after by drug users and as such are prohibited or otherwise heavily regulated for use in many countries:
* Among the barbiturates, pentobarbital (Nembutal), secobarbital (Seconal), and amobarbital (Amytal)
* Among the benzodiazepines, temazepam (Restoril; Normison; Euhypnos), flunitrazepam (Rohypnol; Hypnor; Flunipam), and alprazolam (Xanax)
* Cannabis products, e.g., marijuana, hashish, and hashish oil
* Among the dissociatives, phencyclidine (PCP), and ketamine are the most sought after.
* hallucinogens such as LSD, mescaline, peyote, and psilocybin
* Empathogen-entactogen drugs like MDMA (&quot;ecstasy&quot;)
* Among the narcotics, it is opiates such as morphine and codeine, and opioids such as diacetylmorphine (Heroin), hydrocodone (Vicodin; Hycodan), oxycodone (Percocet; Oxycontin), hydromorphone (Dilaudid), and oxymorphone (Opana).
* Sedatives such as GHB and methaqualone (Quaalude)
* Stimulants such as cocaine, amphetamine (Adderall), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), methamphetamine (Desoxyn), methcathinone, and methylphenidate (Ritalin)

The regulation of the above drugs varies in many countries. Alcohol possession and consumption by adults is today widely banned only in Islamic countries and certain states of India. Although alcohol prohibition was eventually repealed in the countries that enacted it, there are, for example, still parts of the United States that do not allow alcohol sales, though alcohol possession may be legal (see dry counties). New Zealand has banned the importation of chewing tobacco as part of the Smoke-free Environments Act 1990. In some parts of the world, provisions are made for the use of traditional sacraments like ayahuasca, iboga, and peyote. In Gabon, iboga (tabernanthe iboga) has been declared a national treasure and is used in rites of the Bwiti religion. The active ingredient, ibogaine, is proposed as a treatment of opioid withdrawal and various substance use disorders.

In countries where alcohol and tobacco are legal, certain measures are frequently undertaken to discourage use of these drugs. For example, packages of alcohol and tobacco sometimes communicate warnings directed towards the consumer, communicating the potential risks of partaking in the use of the substance. These drugs also frequently have special &quot;sin taxes&quot; associated with the purchase thereof, in order to recoup the losses associated with public funding for the health problems the use causes in long-term users. Restrictions on advertising also exist in many countries, and often a state holds a monopoly on manufacture, distribution, marketing, and/or the sale of these drugs.

===Legal dilemmas===

The sentencing statutes in the United States Code that cover controlled substances are complicated. For example, a first-time offender convicted in a single proceeding for selling marijuana three times, and found to have carried a gun on him all three times (even if it were not used) is subject to a minimum sentence of 55 years in federal prison.

In &quot;Hallucinations: Behavior, Experience, and Theory (1975)&quot;, senior US government researchers Louis Jolyon West and Ronald K. Siegel explain how drug prohibition can be used for selective social control:

Linguist Noam Chomsky argues that drug laws are currently, and have historically been, used by the state to oppress sections of society it opposes:

===Legal highs and prohibition===
In 2013 the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction reported that there are 280 new legal drugs, known as &quot;legal highs&quot;, available in Europe. One of the best known, mephedrone, was banned in the United Kingdom in 2010. On November 24, 2010, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration announced it would use emergency powers to ban many synthetic cannabinoids within a month. An estimated 73 new psychoactive synthetic drugs appeared on the UK market in 2012. The response of the Home Office has been to create a temporary class drug order which bans the manufacture, import, and supply (but not the possession) of named substances.

===Corruption===
In certain countries, there is concern that campaigns against drugs and organized crime are a cover for corrupt officials tied to drug trafficking themselves. In the United States, Federal Bureau of Narcotics chief Harry Anslinger&#x27;s opponents accused him of taking bribes from the Mafia to enact prohibition and create a black market for alcohol. More recently in the Philippines, one death squad hitman told author Niko Vorobyov that he was being paid by military officers to eliminate those drug dealers who failed to pay a &#x27;tax&#x27;. Under President Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippines has waged a bloody war against drugs that may have resulted in up to 29,000 extrajudicial killings.

When it comes to social control with cannabis, there are different aspects to consider. Not only do we assess legislative leaders and the way they vote on cannabis, but we also must consider the federal regulations and taxation that contribute to social controls. For instance, according to a report on the U.S. customs and border protections, the American industry, although banned the main usage of marijuana, was still using products similar such as hemp seeds, oils etc. leading to the previously discussed marijuana tax act.

The Tax act provisions required importers to register and pay an annual tax of $24 and receive an official stamp. Stamps for Products were then affixed to each original order form and recorded by the state revenue collector. Then, a customs collector was to maintain the custody of imported marijuana at entry ports until required documents were received, reviewed and approved.Shipments were subject to searches, seizures and forfeitures if any provisions of the law were not met. Violations would result in fines of no more than $2000 or potential imprisonment for up to 5 years. Oftentimes, this created opportunity for corruption, stolen imports that would later lead to smuggling, oftentimes by state officials and tight knit elitists.

==Penalties==

===United States===


Drug possession is the crime of having one or more illegal drugs in one&#x27;s possession, either for personal use, distribution, sale or otherwise. Illegal drugs fall into different categories and sentences vary depending on the amount, type of drug, circumstances, and jurisdiction. In the U.S., the penalty for illegal drug possession and sale can vary from a small fine to a prison sentence. In some states, marijuana possession is considered to be a petty offense, with the penalty being comparable to that of a speeding violation. In some municipalities, possessing a small quantity of marijuana in one&#x27;s own home is not punishable at all. Generally, however, drug possession is an arrestable offense, although first-time offenders rarely serve jail time. Federal law makes even possession of &quot;soft drugs&quot;, such as cannabis, illegal, though some local governments have laws contradicting federal laws.

In the U.S., the War on Drugs is thought to be contributing to a prison overcrowding problem. In 1996, 59.6% of prisoners were drug-related criminals. The U.S. population grew by about +25% from 1980 to 2000. In that same 20 year time period, the U.S. prison population tripled, making the U.S. the world leader in both percentage and absolute number of citizens incarcerated. The United States has 5% of the world&#x27;s population, but 25% of the prisoners.

About 90% of United States prisoners are incarcerated in state jails. In 2016, about 572,000, over 44%, of the 1.3 million people in these state jails, were serving time for drug offenses. 728,000 were incarcerated for violent offenses.

The data from Federal Bureau of Prisons online statistics page states that 45.9% of prisoners were incarcerated for drug offenses, as of December 2021.

=== European Union ===
In 2004, the Council of the European Union adopted a framework decision harmonizing the minimum penal provisions for illicit drug-related activities. In particular, article 2(9) stipulates that activities may be exempt from the minimum provisions &quot;when it is committed by its perpetrators exclusively for their own personal consumption as defined by national law.&quot; This was made, in particular, to accommodate more liberal national systems such as the Dutch coffee shops (see below) or the Spanish Cannabis Social Clubs.

==== The Netherlands ====

In the Netherlands, cannabis and other &quot;soft&quot; drugs are decriminalised in small quantities. The Dutch government treats the problem as more of a public health issue than a criminal issue. Contrary to popular belief, cannabis is still technically illegal. Coffee shops that sell cannabis to people 18 or above are tolerated, and pay taxes like any other business for their cannabis and hashish sales, although distribution is a grey area that the authorities would rather not go into as it is not decriminalised. Many &quot;coffee shops&quot; are found in Amsterdam and cater mainly to the large tourist trade; the local consumption rate is far lower than in the US. 
The administrative bodies responsible for enforcing the drug policies include the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations, and the Ministry of Finance. Local authorities also shape local policy, within the national framework.

When compared to other countries, Dutch drug consumption falls in the European average at six per cent regular use (twenty-one per cent at some point in life) and considerably lower than the Anglo-Saxon countries headed by the United States with an eight per cent recurring use (thirty-four at some point in life).

=== Australia ===

A Nielsen poll in 2012 found that only 27% of voters favoured decriminalisation. Australia has steep penalties for growing and using drugs even for personal use. with Western Australia having the toughest laws. There is an associated anti-drug culture amongst a significant number of Australians. Law enforcement targets drugs, particularly in the party scene. In 2012, crime statistics in Victoria revealed that police were increasingly arresting users rather than dealers, and the Liberal government banned the sale of bongs that year.

=== Indonesia ===
Indonesia carries a maximum penalty of death for drug dealing, and a maximum of 15 years prison for drug use. In 2004, Australian citizen Schapelle Corby was convicted of smuggling 4.4 kilograms of cannabis into Bali, a crime that carried a maximum penalty of death. Her trial reached the verdict of guilty with a punishment of 20 years imprisonment. Corby claimed to be an unwitting drug mule. Australian citizens known as the &quot;Bali Nine&quot; were caught smuggling heroin. Two of the nine, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, were executed April 29, 2015 along with six other foreign nationals. In August 2005, Australian model Michelle Leslie was arrested with two ecstasy pills. She pleaded guilty to possession and in November 2005 was sentenced to 3 months imprisonment, which she was deemed to have already served, and was released from prison immediately upon her admission of guilt on the charge of possession.

At the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, Indonesia, along with India, Turkey, Pakistan and some South American countries opposed the criminalisation of drugs.

=== Republic of China (Taiwan) ===
Taiwan carries a maximum penalty of death for drug trafficking, while smoking tobacco and wine are classified as legal entertainment drug. The Department of Health is in charge of drug prohibition.

==Cost==
In 2020, the direct cost of drug prohibition to United States taxpayers was estimated at over $40 billion annually. Prohibition can increase organized crime, government corruption, and mass incarceration via the trade in illegal drugs, while racial and gender disparities in enforcement are evident.

Although drug prohibition is often portrayed by proponents as a measure to improve public health, evidence is lacking. In 2016, the Johns Hopkins–Lancet Commission concluded that the &quot;harms of prohibition far outweigh the benefits&quot;, citing increased risk of overdoses and HIV infection and detrimental effects on the social determinants of health. Some proponents argue that drug prohibition&#x27;s effect on suppressing usage rates (although the magnitude of this effect is unknown) outweighs the negative effects of prohibition.

Alternative approaches to prohibition include drug legalization, drug decriminalization, and government monopoly.

<text>Technological applications of superconductivity include:
* the production of sensitive magnetometers based on SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference devices)
* fast digital circuits (including those based on Josephson junctions and rapid single flux quantum technology),
* powerful superconducting electromagnets used in maglev trains, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) machines, magnetic confinement fusion reactors (e.g. tokamaks), and the beam-steering and focusing magnets used in particle accelerators
* low-loss power cables
* RF and microwave filters (e.g., for mobile phone base stations, as well as military ultra-sensitive/selective receivers)
* fast fault current limiters
* high sensitivity particle detectors, including the transition edge sensor, the superconducting bolometer, the superconducting tunnel junction detector, the kinetic inductance detector, and the superconducting nanowire single-photon detector
* railgun and coilgun magnets
* electric motors and generators

==Low-temperature superconductivity==
===Magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance===
The biggest application for superconductivity is in producing the large-volume, stable, and high-intensity magnetic fields required for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). This represents a multi-billion-US$ market for companies such as Oxford Instruments and Siemens. The magnets typically use low-temperature superconductors (LTS) because high-temperature superconductors are not yet cheap enough to cost-effectively deliver the high, stable, and large-volume fields required, notwithstanding the need to cool LTS instruments to liquid helium temperatures. Superconductors are also used in high field scientific magnets.

===Particle accelerators and magnetic fusion devices===
Particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider can include many high field electromagnets requiring large quantities of LTS. To construct the LHC magnets required more than 28 percent of the world&#x27;s niobium-titanium wire production for five years, with large quantities of NbTi also used in the magnets for the LHC&#x27;s huge experiment detectors.

Conventional fusion machines (JET, ST-40, NTSX-U and MAST) use blocks of copper. This limits their fields to 1-3 Tesla. Several superconducting fusion machines are planned for the 2024-2026 timeframe. These include ITER, ARC and the next version of ST-40. The addition of High Temperature Superconductors should yield an order of magnitude improvement in fields (10-13 tesla) for a new generation of Tokamaks.

== High-temperature superconductivity ==
The commercial applications so far for high-temperature superconductors (HTS) have been limited by other properties of the materials discovered thus far. HTS require only liquid nitrogen, not liquid helium, to cool to superconducting temperatures. However, currently known high-temperature superconductors are brittle ceramics that are expensive to manufacture and not easily formed into wires or other useful shapes.
Therefore, the applications for HTS have been where it has some other intrinsic advantage, e.g. in:
* low thermal loss current leads for LTS devices (low thermal conductivity),
* RF and microwave filters (low resistance to RF), and 
* increasingly in specialist scientific magnets, particularly where size and electricity consumption are critical (while HTS wire is much more expensive than LTS in these applications, this can be offset by the relative cost and convenience of cooling); the ability to ramp field is desired (the higher and wider range of HTS&#x27;s operating temperature means faster changes in field can be managed); or cryogen free operation is desired (LTS generally requires liquid helium, which is becoming more scarce and expensive).

=== HTS-based systems ===
HTS has application in scientific and industrial magnets, including use in NMR and MRI systems. Commercial systems are now available in each category.

Also one intrinsic attribute of HTS is that it can withstand much higher magnetic fields than LTS, so HTS at liquid helium temperatures are being explored for very high-field inserts inside LTS magnets.

Promising future industrial and commercial HTS applications include Induction heaters, transformers, fault current limiters, power storage, motors and generators, fusion reactors (see ITER) and magnetic levitation devices.

Early applications will be where the benefit of smaller size, lower weight or the ability to rapidly switch current (fault current limiters) outweighs the added cost. Longer-term as conductor price falls HTS systems should be competitive in a much wider range of applications on energy efficiency grounds alone. (For a relatively technical and US-centric view of state of play of HTS technology in power systems and the development status of Generation 2 conductor see &quot;Superconductivity for Electric Systems 2008 US DOE Annual Peer Review&quot;.)

===Electric power transmission===

The Holbrook Superconductor Project, also known as the LIPA project, was a project to design and build the world&#x27;s first production superconducting transmission power cable. The cable was commissioned in late June 2008 by the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) and was in operation for two years. The suburban Long Island electrical substation is fed by a underground cable system which consists of about of high-temperature superconductor wire manufactured by American Superconductor chilled to with liquid nitrogen, greatly reducing the cost required to deliver additional power. In addition, the installation of the cable bypassed strict regulations for overhead power lines, and offered a solution for the public&#x27;s concerns on overhead power lines.

The Tres Amigas Project was proposed in 2009 as an electrical HVDC interconnector between the Eastern Interconnection, the Western Interconnection and Texas Interconnection. It was proposed to be a multi-mile, triangular pathway of superconducting electric cables, capable of transferring five gigawatts of power between the three U.S. power grids. The project lapsed in 2015 when the Eastern Interconnect withdrew from the project. Construction was never begun.

Essen, Germany has the world&#x27;s longest superconducting power cable in production at 1 kilometer. It is a 10 kV liquid nitrogen cooled cable. The cable is smaller than an equivalent 110 kV regular cable and the lower voltage has the additional benefit of smaller transformers.

In 2020, an aluminium plant in Voerde, Germany, announced plans to use superconductors for cables carrying 200 kA, citing lower volume and material demand as advantages.

=== Magnesium diboride ===
Magnesium diboride is a much cheaper superconductor than either BSCCO or YBCO in terms of cost per current-carrying capacity per length (cost/(kA*m)), in the same ballpark as LTS, and on this basis many manufactured wires are already cheaper than copper. Furthermore, MgB2 superconducts at temperatures higher than LTS (its critical temperature is 39 K, compared with less than 10 K for NbTi and 18.3 K for Nb3Sn), introducing the possibility of using it at 10-20 K in cryogen-free magnets or perhaps eventually in liquid hydrogen. However MgB2 is limited in the magnetic field it can tolerate at these higher temperatures, so further research is required to demonstrate its competitiveness in higher field applications.

===Trapped field magnets===
Exposing superconducting materials to a brief magnetic field can trap the field for use in machines such as generators. In some applications they could replace traditional permanent magnets.

<doc id="51039" wikidata="Q318017" url="?curid=51039" title="Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester">
<text>Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester (24 June 1532 – 4 September 1588) was an English statesman and the favourite of Elizabeth I from her accession until his death. He was a suitor for the queen&#x27;s hand for many years.

Dudley&#x27;s youth was overshadowed by the downfall of his family in 1553 after his father, the Duke of Northumberland, had failed to prevent the accession of Mary I. Robert Dudley was condemned to death but was released in 1554 and took part in the Battle of St. Quentin under Mary&#x27;s husband and co-ruler, Philip, which led to his full rehabilitation, but also to the death of his younger brother Henry. On Elizabeth I&#x27;s accession in November 1558, Dudley was appointed Master of the Horse. In October 1562, he became a privy councillor and, in 1587, was appointed Lord Steward of the Royal Household. In 1564, Dudley became Earl of Leicester and, from 1563, one of the greatest landowners in North Wales and the English West Midlands by royal grants.

The Earl of Leicester was one of Elizabeth&#x27;s leading statesmen, involved in domestic as well as foreign politics alongside William Cecil and Sir Francis Walsingham. Although he refused to be married to Mary, Queen of Scots, Leicester was for a long time relatively sympathetic to her until, from the mid-1580s, he urged her execution. As patron of the Puritan movement, he supported non-conforming preachers but tried to mediate between them and the bishops of the Church of England. A champion also of the international Protestant cause, he led the English campaign in support of the Dutch Revolt (1585–1587). His acceptance of the post of governor-general of the United Provinces infuriated Queen Elizabeth. The expedition was a military and political failure, and it ruined Leicester financially. Leicester was engaged in many large-scale business ventures and was one of the main backers of Francis Drake and other explorers and privateers. During the Spanish Armada, Leicester was in overall command of the English land forces. In this function, he invited Queen Elizabeth to visit her troops at Tilbury. This was the last of many events he had organised over the years, the most spectacular being the festival at his seat Kenilworth Castle in 1575 on the occasion of a three-week visit by the Queen. Leicester was a principal patron of the arts, literature, and the Elizabethan theatre.

Leicester&#x27;s private life interfered with his court career and &quot;vice versa&quot;. When his first wife, Amy Robsart, fell down a flight of stairs and died in 1560, he was free to marry the queen. However, the resulting scandal very much reduced his chances in this respect. Popular rumours that he had arranged for his wife&#x27;s death continued throughout his life, despite the coroner&#x27;s jury&#x27;s verdict of accident. For 18 years he did not remarry for Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s sake and when he finally did, his new wife, Lettice Knollys, was permanently banished from court. This and the death of his only legitimate son and heir were heavy blows. Shortly after the child&#x27;s death in 1584, a virulent libel known as &quot;Leicester&#x27;s Commonwealth&quot; was circulated in England. It laid the foundation of a literary and historiographical tradition that often depicted Leicester as the Machiavellian &quot;master courtier&quot; and as a deplorable figure around Elizabeth I. More recent research has led to a reassessment of his place in Elizabethan government and society.

==Youth==
===Education and marriage===
Robert Dudley was the fifth son of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, and his wife Jane, daughter of Sir Edward Guildford. His paternal grandfather, Edmund Dudley, had been an adviser to King Henry VII and was executed for treason in 1510 by King Henry VIII. John and Jane Dudley had 13 children in all and were known for their happy family life. Among the siblings&#x27; tutors figured John Dee, Thomas Wilson, and Roger Ascham.

Roger Ascham believed that Robert Dudley possessed a rare talent for languages and writing, including in Latin, regretting that his pupil had done himself harm by preferring mathematics. Robert learned the craft of the courtier at the courts of Henry VIII, and especially Edward VI, among whose companions he served.

In 1549, Robert Dudley participated in crushing Kett&#x27;s Rebellion and probably first met Amy Robsart, whom he was to wed on 4 June 1550 in the presence of the young King Edward. She was of the same age as the bridegroom and the daughter and heiress of Sir John Robsart, a gentleman-farmer of Norfolk. It was a love-match, the young couple depending heavily on their fathers&#x27; gifts, especially Robert&#x27;s. John Dudley, who since early 1550 effectively ruled England, was pleased to strengthen his influence in Norfolk by his son&#x27;s marriage. Lord Robert, as he was styled as a duke&#x27;s son, became an important local gentleman and served as a Member of Parliament for Norfolk in 1551–52, March 1553 and 1559. His court career went on in parallel.

===Condemned and pardoned===
On 6 July 1553, King Edward VI died and the Duke of Northumberland attempted to transfer the English crown to Lady Jane Grey, who was married to his second youngest son, Lord Guildford Dudley. Robert Dudley led a force of 300 into Norfolk where Edward&#x27;s half-sister Mary was assembling her followers. After some ten days in the county and securing several towns for Jane, he took King&#x27;s Lynn and proclaimed her in the marketplace. The next day, 19 July, Jane&#x27;s reign was over in London. Soon, the townsmen of King&#x27;s Lynn seized Robert Dudley and the rest of his small troop and sent him to Framlingham Castle before Mary I.

Robert Dudley was imprisoned in the Tower of London, attainted, and condemned to death, as were his father and four brothers. His father went to the scaffold. In the Tower, Dudley&#x27;s stay coincided with the imprisonment of his childhood friend, Edward and Mary&#x27;s half-sister Elizabeth, who was sent there on suspicion of involvement in Wyatt&#x27;s rebellion. Guildford Dudley was executed in February 1554. The surviving brothers were released in the autumn; working for their release, their mother (who died in January 1555) and their brother-in-law, Henry Sidney, had befriended the incoming Spanish nobles around Philip of Spain, Mary&#x27;s husband.

In December 1554, Ambrose and Robert Dudley took part in a tournament held to celebrate Anglo-Spanish friendship. Yet, the Dudley brothers were only welcome at court as long as King Philip was there, otherwise they were even suspected of associating with people who conspired against Mary&#x27;s regime. In January 1557, Robert and Amy Dudley were allowed to repossess some of their former lands, and in March of the same year Dudley was at Calais where he was chosen to deliver personally to Queen Mary the happy news of Philip&#x27;s return to England. Ambrose, Robert, and Henry Dudley, the youngest brother, fought for Philip II at the Battle of St. Quentin in August 1557. Henry Dudley was killed in the following siege by a cannonball—according to Robert, before his own eyes. All surviving Dudley children — Ambrose and Robert with their sisters, Mary and Katherine — were restored in blood by Mary I&#x27;s next parliament in 1558.

==Royal favourite==
Robert Dudley was counted among Elizabeth&#x27;s special friends by Philip II&#x27;s envoy to the English court a week before Queen Mary&#x27;s death. On 18 November 1558, the morning after Elizabeth&#x27;s accession, Dudley witnessed the surrender of the Great Seal to her at Hatfield. He became Master of the Horse on the same day. This was an important court position entailing close attendance on the sovereign. It suited him, as he was an excellent horseman and showed great professional interest in royal transport and accommodation, horse breeding, and the supply of horses for all occasions. Dudley was also entrusted with organising and overseeing a large part of the Queen&#x27;s coronation festivities.

In April 1559 Dudley was elected a Knight of the Garter. Shortly before, Philip II had been informed:

Lord Robert has come so much into favour that he does whatever he likes with affairs and it is even said that her majesty visits him in his chamber day and night. People talk of this so freely that they go so far as to say that his wife has a malady in one of her breasts and the Queen is only waiting for her to die to marry Lord Robert ... Matters have reached such a pass ... that ... it would ... be well to approach Lord Robert on your Majesty&#x27;s behalf ... Your Majesty would do well to attract and confirm him in his friendship.

Within a month the Spanish ambassador, Count de Feria, counted Robert Dudley among three persons who ran the country. Visiting foreigners of princely rank were bidding for his goodwill. He acted as an official host on state occasions and was himself a frequent guest at ambassadorial dinners. By the autumn of 1559 several foreign princes were vying for the Queen&#x27;s hand; their impatient envoys came under the impression that Elizabeth was fooling them, &quot;keeping Lord Robert&#x27;s enemies and the country engaged with words until this wicked deed of killing his wife is consummated.&quot; &quot;Lord Robert&quot;, the new Spanish ambassador de Quadra was convinced, was the man &quot;in whom it is easy to recognise the king that is to be ... she will marry none but the favoured Robert.&quot; Many of the nobility would not brook Dudley&#x27;s new prominence, as they could not &quot;put up with his being King.&quot; Plans to kill the favourite abounded, and Dudley took to wearing a light coat of mail under his clothes. Among all classes, in England and abroad, gossip got underway that the Queen had children by Dudley—such rumours never quite ended for the rest of her life.

===Amy Dudley&#x27;s death===
Already in April 1559 court observers noted that Elizabeth never let Dudley from her side; but her favour did not extend to his wife. Amy Dudley lived in different parts of the country since her ancestral manor house was uninhabitable. Her husband visited her for four days at Easter 1559 and she spent a month around London in the early summer of the same year. They never saw each other again; Dudley was with the Queen at Windsor Castle and possibly planning a visit to her, when his wife was found dead at her residence Cumnor Place near Oxford on 8 September 1560:
There came to me Bowes, by whom I do understand that my wife is dead and as he sayeth by a fall from a pair of stairs. Little other understanding can I have of him. The greatness and the suddenness of the misfortune doth so perplex me, until I do hear from you how the matter standeth, or how this evil should light upon me, considering what the malicious world will bruit, as I can take no rest.


Retiring to his house at Kew, away from court as from the putative crime scene, he pressed for an impartial inquiry which had already begun in the form of an inquest. The jury found that it was an accident: Lady Dudley, staying alone &quot;in a certain chamber&quot;, had fallen down the adjoining stairs, sustaining two head injuries and breaking her neck. It was widely suspected that Dudley had arranged his wife&#x27;s death to be able to marry the Queen. The scandal played into the hands of nobles and politicians who desperately tried to prevent Elizabeth from marrying him. Most historians have considered murder to be unlikely. The coroner&#x27;s report came to light in The National Archives in 2008 and is compatible with an accidental fall as well as suicide or other violence. In the absence of the forensic findings of 1560, it was often assumed that a simple accident could not be the explanation—on the basis of near-contemporary tales that Amy Dudley was found at the bottom of a short flight of stairs with a broken neck, her headdress still standing undisturbed &quot;upon her head&quot;, a detail that first appeared as a satirical remark in the libel &quot;Leicester&#x27;s Commonwealth&quot; of 1584 and has ever since been repeated for a fact. To account for such oddities and evidence that she was ill, it was suggested in 1956 by Ian Aird, a professor of surgery, that Amy Dudley might have suffered from breast cancer, which through metastatic cancerous deposits in the spine, could have caused her neck to break under only limited strain, such as a short fall or even just coming down the stairs. This explanation has been widely accepted. Suicide has also often been considered an option, motives being Amy Dudley&#x27;s depression or mortal illness.

===Marriage hopes and proposals===
Elizabeth remained close to Dudley and he, with her blessing and on her prompting, pursued his suit for her hand in an atmosphere of diplomatic intrigue. His wife&#x27;s and his father&#x27;s shadows haunted his prospects. His efforts leading nowhere, in the spring of 1561 Dudley offered to leave England to seek military adventures abroad; Elizabeth would have none of that and everything remained as it was.

In October 1562, the Queen fell ill with smallpox and, believing her life to be in danger, she asked the Privy Council to make Robert Dudley Protector of the Realm and to give him a suitable title together with 20,000 pounds a year. There was universal relief when she recovered her health; Dudley was made a privy councillor. He was already deeply involved in foreign politics, including Scotland.

In 1563, Elizabeth suggested Dudley as a consort to the widowed Mary, Queen of Scots, the idea being to achieve firm amity between England and Scotland and diminish the influence of foreign powers. Elizabeth&#x27;s preferred solution was that they should all live together at the English court, so that she would not have to forgo her favourite&#x27;s company. Mary at first enquired if Elizabeth was serious, wanting above all to know her chances of inheriting the English crown. Elizabeth repeatedly declared that she was prepared to acknowledge Mary as her heir only on condition that she marry Robert Dudley. Mary&#x27;s Protestant advisors warmed to the prospect of her marriage to Dudley, and in September 1564 he was created Earl of Leicester, a move designed to make him more acceptable to Mary. In January 1565, Thomas Randolph, the English ambassador to Scotland, was told by the Scottish queen that she would accept the proposal. To his amazement, Dudley was not to be moved to comply: But a man of that nature I never found any ... he whom I go about to make as happy as ever was any, to put him in possession of a kingdom, to lay in his naked arms a most fair ... lady ... nothing regardeth the good that shall ensue unto him thereby ... but so uncertainly dealeth that I know not where to find him. Dudley indeed had made it clear to the Scots at the beginning that he was not a candidate for Mary&#x27;s hand and forthwith had behaved with passive resistance. He also worked in the interest of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, Mary&#x27;s eventual choice of husband. Elizabeth herself wavered as to declaring Mary her heir, until in March 1565 she decided she could not bring herself to it. Still, she finally told the Spanish ambassador that the proposal fell through because the Earl of Leicester refused to cooperate.

By 1564, Dudley had realised that his chances of becoming Elizabeth&#x27;s consort were small. At the same time he could not &quot;consider ... without great repugnance&quot;, as he said, that she chose another husband. Confronted with other marriage projects, Elizabeth continued to say that she still would very much like to marry him. Dudley was seen as a serious candidate until the mid-1560s and later. To remove this threat to Habsburg and Valois suitors, between 1565 and 1578, four German and French princesses were mooted as brides for Leicester, as a consolation for giving up Elizabeth and his resistance to her foreign marriage projects. These he had sabotaged and would continue to sabotage. In 1566 Dudley formed the opinion that Elizabeth would never marry, recalling that she had always said so since she was eight years old; but he still was hopeful—she had also assured him he would be her choice in case she changed her mind (and married an Englishman).

===Life at court===
As &quot;a male favourite to a virgin queen&quot;, Robert Dudley found himself in an unprecedented situation. His apartments at court were next to hers, and—perceived as knowing &quot;the Queen and her nature best of any man&quot;—his influence was matched by few. Another side of such privileges was Elizabeth&#x27;s possessiveness and jealousy. His company was essential for her well-being and for many years he was hardly allowed to leave. Sir Christopher Hatton reported a growing emergency when the Earl was away for a few weeks in 1578: &quot;This court wanteth your presence. Her majesty is unaccompanied and, I assure you, the chambers are almost empty.&quot;

On ceremonial occasions, Dudley often acted as an unofficial consort, sometimes in the Queen&#x27;s stead. He largely assumed charge of court ceremonial and organised hundreds of small and large festivities. From 1587 he was Lord Steward, being responsible for the royal household&#x27;s supply with food and other commodities. He displayed a strong sense for economising and reform in this function, which he had &quot;de facto&quot; occupied long before his official appointment. The sanitary situation in the palaces was a perennial problem, and a talk with Leicester about these issues inspired John Harington to construct a water closet. Leicester was a lifelong sportsman, hunting and jousting in the tiltyard, and an indefatigable tennis-player. He was also the Queen&#x27;s regular dancing partner.

==Ancestral and territorial ambition==
After the Duke of Northumberland&#x27;s attainder the entire Dudley inheritance had disappeared. His sons had to start from scratch in rebuilding the family fortunes, as they had renounced any rights to their father&#x27;s former possessions or titles when their own attainders had been lifted in January 1558. Robert Dudley financed the lifestyle expected of a royal favourite by large loans from City of London merchants until in April 1560 Elizabeth granted him his first export licence, worth £6,000 p.a. He also received some of his father&#x27;s lands, but since he was not the family heir it was a matter of some difficulty to find a suitable estate for his intended peerage. In June 1563 the Queen granted him Kenilworth Manor, Castle, and Park, together with the lordships of Denbigh and Chirk in North Wales. Other grants were to follow. Eventually, Leicester and his elder brother Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick, came to preside over the greatest aristocratic interest in the West Midlands and North Wales.

===Denbighshire===
At the time Robert Dudley entered his new Welsh possessions there had existed a tenurial chaos for more than half a century. Some leading local families benefited from this to the detriment of the Crown&#x27;s revenue. To remedy this situation, and to increase his own income, Dudley affected compositions with the tenants in what Simon Adams has called an &quot;ambitious resolution of a long-standing problem ... without parallel in Elizabeth&#x27;s reign&quot;. All tenants that had so far only been copyholders were raised to the status of freeholders in exchange for newly agreed rents. Likewise, all tenants&#x27; rights of common were secured as were the boundaries of the commons, thus striking a balance between property rights and protection against enclosure.

Though an absentee landlord, Leicester, who was also Lord of Denbigh, regarded the lordship as an integral part of a territorial base for a revived House of Dudley. He set about developing the town of Denbigh with large building projects; the church he planned, though, was never finished, being too ambitious. It would have been not only the largest, but also the first post-Reformation church in England and Wales built according to a plan where the preacher was to take the centre instead of the altar, thus stressing the importance of preaching in the Protestant Church. In vain Leicester tried to have the nearby episcopal see of St Asaph transferred to Denbigh. He also encouraged and supported the translation of the Bible and the Common Prayer Book into Welsh.

===Warwick and Kenilworth===
Ambrose and Robert Dudley were very close, in matters of business and personally. Through their paternal grandmother they descended from the Hundred Years War heroes, John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, and Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick. Robert Dudley was especially fascinated by the Beauchamp descent and, with his brother, adopted the ancient heraldic device of the earls of Warwick, the Bear and Ragged Staff. Due to such genealogical aspects the West Midlands held a special significance for him. The town of Warwick felt this during a magnificent visit by the Earl in 1571 to celebrate the feast of the Order of Saint Michael, with which Leicester had been invested by the French king in 1566. He shortly afterwards founded Lord Leycester&#x27;s Hospital, a charity for aged and injured soldiers still functioning today. Kenilworth Castle was the centre of Leicester&#x27;s ambitions to &quot;plant&quot; himself in the region, and he substantially transformed the site&#x27;s appearance through comprehensive alterations. He added a 15th-century style gatehouse to the castle&#x27;s medieval structures, as well as a formal garden and a residential wing which featured the &quot;brittle, thin walls and grids of windows&quot; that were to become the hallmark of Elizabethan architecture in later decades. His works completed, the Earl staged a spectacular 19-day-festival in July 1575 as a final, allegorical bid for the Queen&#x27;s hand; it was as much a request to give him leave to marry someone else. There was a Lady of the Lake, a swimming papier-mâché dolphin with a little orchestra in its belly, fireworks, masques, hunts, and popular entertainments like bear baiting. The whole scenery of landscape, artificial lake, castle, and Renaissance garden was ingeniously used for the entertainment.

==Love affairs and remarriage==
Confronted by a Puritan friend with rumours about his &quot;ungodly life&quot;, Dudley defended himself in 1576: I stand on the top of the hill, where ... the smallest slip seemeth a fall ... I may fall many ways and have more witnesses thereof than many others who perhaps be no saints neither ... for my faults ... they lie before Him who I have no doubt but will cancel them as I have been and shall be most heartily sorry for them. With Douglas Sheffield, a young widow of the Howard family, he had a serious relationship from about 1569. He explained to her that he could not marry, not even in order to beget a Dudley heir, without his &quot;utter overthrow&quot;: You must think it is some marvellous cause ... that forceth me thus to be cause almost of the ruin of mine own house ... my brother you see long married and not like to have children, it resteth so now in myself; and yet such occasions is there ... as if I should marry I am sure never to have [the Queen&#x27;s] favour&quot;. Although in this letter Leicester said he still loved her as he did at the beginning, he offered her his help to find another husband for reasons of respectability if she so wished. The affair continued and in 1574 Douglas gave birth to a son, also called Robert Dudley.

Lettice Knollys was the wife of Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex, and a first cousin once removed of Queen Elizabeth on her mother&#x27;s side. Leicester had flirted with her in the summer of 1565, causing an outbreak of jealousy in the Queen. After Lord Essex went to Ireland in 1573, they possibly became lovers. There was much talk, and on Essex&#x27;s homecoming in December 1575, &quot;great enmity between the Earl of Leicester and the Earl of Essex&quot; was expected. In July 1576 Essex returned to Ireland, where he died of dysentery in September. Rumours of poison, administered by the Earl of Leicester&#x27;s means, were soon abroad. The Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir Henry Sidney, conducted an official investigation which did not find any indications of foul play but &quot;a disease appropriate to this country ... whereof ... died many&quot;. The rumours continued.

The prospect of marriage to the Countess of Essex on the horizon, Leicester finally drew a line under his relationship with Douglas Sheffield. Contrary to what she later claimed, they came to an amicable agreement over their son&#x27;s custody. Young Robert grew up in Dudley&#x27;s and his friends&#x27; houses, but had &quot;leave to see&quot; his mother until she left England in 1583. Leicester was very fond of his son and gave him an excellent education. In his will he left him the bulk of his estate (after his brother Ambrose&#x27;s death), including Kenilworth Castle. Douglas Sheffield remarried in 1579. After the death of Elizabeth I in 1603, the younger Robert Dudley tried unsuccessfully to prove that his parents had married 30 years earlier in a secret ceremony. In that case, he would have been able to claim the earldoms of Leicester and Warwick. His mother supported him, but maintained that she had been strongly against raising the issue and was possibly pressured by her son. Leicester himself had throughout considered the boy as illegitimate.

On 21 September 1578, Leicester secretly married Lady Essex at his country house at Wanstead, with only a handful of relatives and friends present. He did not dare to tell the Queen of his marriage; nine months later Leicester&#x27;s enemies at court acquainted her with the situation, causing a furious outburst. She already had been aware of his marriage plans a year earlier, though. Leicester&#x27;s hope of an heir was fulfilled in 1581 when another Robert Dudley, styled Lord Denbigh, was born. The child died aged three in 1584, leaving his parents disconsolate. Leicester found comfort in God since, as he wrote, &quot;princes ... seldom do pity according to the rules of charity.&quot; The Earl turned out to be a devoted husband: In 1583, the French ambassador, Michel de Castelnau, wrote of &quot;the Earl of Leicester and his lady to whom he is much attached&quot;, and &quot;who has much influence over him&quot;. Leicester was a concerned parent to his four stepchildren, and in every respect worked for the advancement of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, whom he regarded as his political heir.

The marriage of her favourite hurt the Queen deeply. She never accepted it, humiliating Leicester in public: &quot;my open and great disgraces delivered from her Majesty&#x27;s mouth&quot;. Then again, she would be as fond of him as ever. In 1583 she informed ambassadors that Lettice Dudley was &quot;a she-wolf&quot; and her husband a &quot;traitor&quot; and &quot;a cuckold&quot;. Lady Leicester&#x27;s social life was much curtailed. Even her movements could pose a political problem, as Francis Walsingham explained: &quot;I see not her Majesty disposed to use the services of my Lord of Leicester. There is great offence taken at the conveying down of his lady.&quot; The Earl stood by his wife, asking his colleagues to intercede for her; there was no hope: &quot;She [the Queen] doth take every occasion by my marriage to withdraw any good from me&quot;, Leicester wrote even after seven years of marriage.

==Colleagues and politics==
For the first 30 years of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, until Leicester&#x27;s death, he and Lord Burghley were the most powerful and important political figures, working intimately with the Queen. Robert Dudley was a conscientious privy councillor, and one of the most frequently attending.

In 1560 the diplomat Nicholas Throckmorton advocated vehemently against Dudley marrying the Queen, but Dudley won him over in 1562. Throckmorton henceforth became his political advisor and intimate. After Throckmorton&#x27;s death in 1571, there quickly evolved a political alliance between the Earl of Leicester and Sir Francis Walsingham, soon to be Secretary of State. Together they worked for a militant Protestant foreign policy. There also existed a family relationship between them after Walsingham&#x27;s daughter had married Philip Sidney, Leicester&#x27;s favourite nephew. Leicester, after some initial jealousy, also became a good friend of Sir Christopher Hatton, himself one of Elizabeth&#x27;s favourites.

Robert Dudley&#x27;s relationship with William Cecil, Lord Burghley, was complicated. Traditionally they have been seen as enemies, and Cecil behind the scenes sabotaged Dudley&#x27;s endeavours to obtain the Queen&#x27;s hand. On the other hand, they were on friendly terms and had an efficient working relationship which never broke down. In 1572, the vacant post of Lord High Treasurer was offered to Leicester, who declined and proposed Burghley, stating that the latter was the much more suitable candidate. In later years, being at odds, Dudley felt like reminding Cecil of their &quot;thirty years friendship&quot;.

On the whole, Cecil and Dudley were in concord about policies while disagreeing fundamentally about some issues, such as the Queen&#x27;s marriage and some areas of foreign policy. Cecil favoured the suit of Francois, Duke of Anjou, in 1578–1581 for Elizabeth&#x27;s hand, while Leicester was among its strongest opponents, even contemplating exile in letters to Burghley. The Anjou courtship, at the end of which Leicester and several dozen noblemen and gentlemen escorted the French prince to Antwerp, also touched the question of English intervention in the Netherlands to help the rebellious provinces. This debate stretched over a decade until 1585, with the Earl of Leicester as the foremost interventionist. Burghley was more cautious of military engagement while in a dilemma over his Protestant predilections.

Until about 1571/1572, Dudley supported Mary Stuart&#x27;s succession rights to the English throne. He was also, from the early 1560s, on the best terms with the Protestant lords in Scotland, thereby supporting the English or, as he saw it, the Protestant interest. After Mary Stuart&#x27;s flight into England (1568) Leicester was, unlike Cecil, in favour of restoring her as Scottish queen under English control, preferably with a Protestant English husband, such as the Duke of Norfolk. In 1577 Leicester had a personal meeting with Mary and listened to her complaints about her captivity. By the early 1580s Mary had come to fear Leicester&#x27;s influence with James VI, her son, in whose privy chamber the English Earl had placed a spy. She spread stories about his supposed lust for the English throne, and when the Catholic anti-Leicester libel, &quot;Leicester&#x27;s Commonwealth&quot;, was published in 1584 Dudley believed that Mary was involved in its conception.

The &quot;Bond of Association&quot;, which the Privy Council gave out in October 1584, may have originated in Dudley&#x27;s ideas. Circulated in the country, the document&#x27;s subscribers swore that, should Elizabeth be assassinated (as William the Silent had been a few months earlier), not only the killer but also the royal person who would benefit from this should be executed. Leicester&#x27;s relations with James of Scotland grew closer when he gained the confidence of the King&#x27;s favourite, Patrick, Master of Gray, in 1584–1585. His negotiations with the Master were the basis for the Treaty of Berwick, a defensive alliance between the two British states against European powers. In 1586 Walsingham uncovered the Babington Plot. Following the Ridolfi Plot (1571) and the Throckmorton Plot (1583), this was another scheme to assassinate Elizabeth in which Mary Stuart was involved. Following her conviction, Leicester, then in the Netherlands, vehemently urged her execution in his letters; he despaired of Elizabeth&#x27;s security after so many plots.

Leicester having returned to England, in February 1587 Elizabeth signed Mary&#x27;s death warrant, with the proviso that it be not carried out until she gave her approval. As there was no sign of her doing so, Burghley, Leicester, and a handful of other privy councillors decided to proceed with Mary&#x27;s execution in the interest of the state. Leicester went to Bath and Bristol for his health; unlike the other privy councillors involved, he escaped Elizabeth&#x27;s severe wrath on hearing the news of Mary&#x27;s death.

==Patronage==

===Exploration and business===
Robert Dudley was a pioneer of new industries; interested in many things from tapestries to mining, he was engaged in the first joint stock companies in English history. The Earl also concerned himself with relieving unemployment among the poor. On a personal level, he gave to poor people, petitioners, and prisons on a daily basis. Due to his interests in trade and exploration, as well as his debts, his contacts with the London city fathers were intense. He was an enthusiastic investor in the Muscovy Company and the Merchant Adventurers. English relations with Morocco were also handled by Leicester. This he did in the manner of his private business affairs, underpinned by a patriotic and missionary zeal (commercially, these relations were loss-making). He took much interest in the careers of John Hawkins and Francis Drake from early on, and was a principal backer of Drake&#x27;s circumnavigation of the world. Robert and Ambrose Dudley were also the principal patrons of Martin Frobisher&#x27;s 1576 search for the Northwest Passage. Later Leicester acquired his own ship, the &quot;Galleon Leicester&quot;, which he employed in a luckless expedition under Edward Fenton, but also under Drake. As much as profit, English seapower was on his mind, and accordingly, Leicester became a friend and leading supporter of Dom António, the exiled claimant to the Portuguese throne after 1580.

===Learning, theatre, the arts, and literature===
Apart from their legal function, the Inns of Court were the Tudor equivalents of gentlemen&#x27;s clubs. In 1561, grateful for favours he had done them, the Inner Temple admitted Dudley as their most privileged member, their &quot;Lord and Governor&quot;. He was allowed to build his own apartments on the premises and organised grand festivities and performances in the Temple. As Chancellor of Oxford University Dudley was highly committed. He enforced the Thirty-nine Articles and the oath of royal supremacy at Oxford, and obtained from the Queen an incorporation by Act of Parliament for the university. Leicester was also instrumental in founding the official Oxford University Press, and installed the pioneer of international law, Alberico Gentili, and the exotic theologian, Antonio del Corro, at Oxford. Over del Corro&#x27;s controversial case he even sacked the university&#x27;s Vice-Chancellor.

Around 100 books were dedicated to Robert Dudley during Elizabeth&#x27;s reign. In 1564/1567 Arthur Golding dedicated his popular translation of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; to the Earl. Dudley took a special interest in translations, which were seen as a means to popularise learning among &quot;all who could read.&quot; He was also a history enthusiast, and in 1559 suggested to the tailor John Stow to become a chronicler (as Stow recalled in 1604). Robert Dudley&#x27;s interest in the theatre was manifold, from academic plays at Oxford to the protection of the Children of St. Paul&#x27;s and of the Royal Chapel, and their respective masters, against hostile bishops and landlords. From at least 1559 he had his own company of players, and in 1574 he obtained for them the first royal patent issued to actors to allow them to tour the country unmolested by local authorities. The Earl also kept a separate company of musicians who in 1586 played before the King of Denmark; with them travelled William Kempe, &quot;the Lord Leicester&#x27;s jesting player&quot;.

Leicester possessed one of the largest collections of paintings in Elizabethan England, being the first great private collector. He was a principal patron of Nicholas Hilliard, as well as interested in all aspects of Italian culture. The Earl&#x27;s circle of scholars and men of letters included, among others, his nephew Philip Sidney, the astrologer and Hermeticist John Dee, his secretaries Edward Dyer and Jean Hotman, as well as John Florio and Gabriel Harvey. Through Harvey, Edmund Spenser found employment at Leicester House on the Strand, the Earl&#x27;s palatial town house, where he wrote his first works of poetry. Many years after Leicester&#x27;s death Spenser wistfully recalled this time in his &quot;Prothalamion&quot;, and in 1591 he remembered the late Earl with his poem &quot;The Ruins of Time&quot;.

===Religion===
Robert Dudley grew up as a Protestant. Presumably conforming in public under Mary I, he was counted among the &quot;heretics&quot; by Philip II&#x27;s agent before Elizabeth&#x27;s accession. He immediately became a major patron to former Edwardian clerics and returning exiles. Meanwhile, he also helped some of Mary&#x27;s former servants and maintained Catholic contacts. From 1561 he advocated and supported the Huguenot cause, and the French ambassador described him as &quot;totally of the Calvinist religion&quot; in 1568. After the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day Massacre in 1572 this trait in him became more pronounced, and he continued as the chief patron of English Puritans and a champion of international Calvinism. On the other hand, in his household, Leicester employed Catholics like Sir Christopher Blount, who held a position of trust and of whom he was personally fond. The Earl&#x27;s patronage of and reliance on individuals was as much a matter of old family loyalties or personal relationships as of religious allegiances.

Leicester was especially interested in the furtherance of preaching, which was the main concern of moderate Puritanism. He went to great lengths to support non-conforming preachers, while warning them against too radical positions which, he argued, would only endanger what reforms had been hitherto achieved. He would not condone the overthrow of the existing church model because of &quot;trifles&quot;, he said. &quot;I am not, I thank God, fantastically persuaded in religion but ... do find it soundly and godly set forth in this universal Church of England.&quot; Accordingly, he tried to smooth things out and, among other moves, initiated several disputations between the more radical elements of the Church and the episcopal side so that they &quot;might make reconcilement&quot;. His influence in ecclesiastical matters was considerable until it declined in the 1580s under Archbishop John Whitgift.

==Governor-General of the United Provinces==
During the 1570s, Leicester built a special relationship with Prince William of Orange, who held him in high esteem. The Earl became generally popular in the Netherlands. Since 1577 he pressed for an English military expedition, led by himself (as the Dutch strongly wished) to succour the rebels. In 1584 the Prince of Orange was murdered, political chaos ensued, and in August 1585 Antwerp fell to the Duke of Parma. An English intervention became inevitable; it was decided that Leicester would go to the Netherlands and &quot;be their chief as heretofore was treated of&quot;, as he phrased it in August 1585. He was alluding to the recently signed Treaty of Nonsuch in which his position and authority as &quot;governor-general&quot; of the Netherlands had only been vaguely defined. The Earl prepared himself for &quot;God&#x27;s cause and her Majesty&#x27;s&quot; by recruiting the expedition&#x27;s cavalry from his retainers and friends, and by mortgaging his estate to the sum of £25,000.

On Thursday, 9 December 1585, the Earl of Leicester set sail for the Low Countries from Harwich and landed after a swift crossing of less than 24 hours, the fleet anchored at Flushing (Vlissingen). At the end of December 1585 Leicester was received in the Netherlands, according to one correspondent, in the manner of a second Charles V; a Dutch town official already noted in his minute-book that the Earl was going to have &quot;absolute power and authority&quot;. After progress through several cities and so many festivals he arrived in The Hague, where on 1 January 1586 he was urged to accept the title governor-general by the States General of the United Provinces. Leicester wrote to Burghley and Walsingham, explaining why he believed the Dutch importunities should be answered favourably. He accepted his elevation on 25 January, having not yet received any communications from England due to constant adverse winds.

The Earl had now &quot;the rule and government general&quot; with a Council of State to support him (the members of which he nominated himself). He remained a subject of Elizabeth, making it possible to contend that she was now over the Netherlands. According to Leicester, this was what the Dutch desired. From the start such a position for him had been implied in the Dutch propositions to the English, and in their instructions to Leicester; and it was consistent with the Dutch understanding of the Treaty of Nonsuch. The English queen, however, in her instructions to Leicester, had expressly declined to accept offers of sovereignty from the United Provinces while still demanding of the States to follow the &quot;advice&quot; of her lieutenant-general in matters of government. Her ministers on both sides of the Channel hoped she would accept the situation as a &quot;fait accompli&quot; and could even be persuaded to add the rebellious provinces to her possessions. Instead her fury knew no bounds and Elizabeth sent Sir Thomas Heneage to read out her letters of disapproval before the States General, Leicester having to stand nearby. Elizabeth&#x27;s &quot;commandment&quot; was that the Governor-General immediately resign his post in a formal ceremony in the same place where he had taken it. After much pleading with her and protestations by the Dutch, it was postulated that the governor-generalship had been bestowed not by any sovereign, but by the States General and thereby by the people. The damage was done, however: &quot;My credit hath been cracked ever since her Majesty sent Sir Thomas Heneage hither&quot;, Leicester recapitulated in October 1586.

Elizabeth demanded of her Lieutenant-General to refrain at all costs from any decisive action with Parma, which was the opposite of what Leicester wished and what the Dutch expected of him. After some initial successes, the unexpected surrender of the strategically important town of Grave was a serious blow to English morale. Leicester&#x27;s fury turned on the town&#x27;s governor, Baron Hemart, whom he had executed despite all pleadings. The Dutch nobility were astonished: even the Prince of Orange would not have dared such an outrage, Leicester was warned; but, he wrote, he would not be intimidated by the fact that Hemart &quot;was of a good house&quot;.

Leicester&#x27;s forces, small and seriously underfinanced from the outset, faced the most formidable army in Europe. Unity among their ranks was at risk by Leicester&#x27;s and the other officers&#x27; quarrels with Sir John Norris, who had commanded previous English contingents in the Netherlands and was now the Earl&#x27;s deputy. Elizabeth was angry that the war cost more than anticipated and for many months delayed sending money and troops. This not only forced Dudley to raise further funds on his own account, but much aggravated the soldiers&#x27; lot. &quot;They cannot get a penny; their credit is spent; they perish for want of victuals and clothing in great numbers ... I assure you it will fret me to death ere long to see my soldiers in this case and cannot help them&quot;, Leicester wrote home.

Many Dutch statesmen were essentially politiques; they soon became disenchanted with the Earl&#x27;s enthusiastic fostering of what he called &quot;the religion&quot;. His most loyal friends were the Calvinists at Utrecht and Friesland, provinces in constant opposition to Holland and Zeeland. Those rich provinces engaged in a lucrative trade with Spain which was very helpful to either side&#x27;s war effort. On Elizabeth&#x27;s orders Leicester enforced a ban on this trade with the enemy, thus alienating the wealthy Dutch merchants. He also affected a fiscal reform. In order to centralise finances and to replace the highly corrupt tax farming with direct taxation, a new Council of Finances was established which was not under the supervision of the Council of State. The Dutch members of the Council of State were outraged at these bold steps. English peace talks with Spain behind Leicester&#x27;s back, which had started within days after he had left England, undermined his position further.

In September 1586 there was a skirmish at Zutphen, in which Philip Sidney was wounded. He died a few weeks later. His uncle&#x27;s grief was great. In December Leicester returned to England. In his absence, William Stanley and Rowland York, two Catholic officers whom Leicester had placed in command of Deventer and the fort of Zutphen, respectively, went over to Parma, along with their key fortresses—a disaster for the Anglo-Dutch coalition in every respect. His Dutch friends, as his English critics, pressed for Leicester&#x27;s return to the Netherlands. Shortly after his arrival in June 1587 the English-held port of Sluis was lost to Parma, Leicester being unable to assert his authority over the Dutch allies, who refused to cooperate in relieving the town. After this blow Elizabeth, who ascribed it to &quot;the malice or other foul error of the States&quot;, was happy to enter into peace negotiations with the Duke of Parma. By December 1587 the differences between Elizabeth and the Dutch politicians, with Leicester in between, had become insurmountable; he asked to be recalled by the Queen and gave up his post. He was irredeemably in debt because of his personal financing of the war.

==Armada and death==
In July 1588, as the Spanish Armada came nearer, the Earl of Leicester was appointed &quot;Lieutenant and Captain-General of the Queen&#x27;s Armies and Companies&quot;. At Tilbury on the Thames he erected a camp for the defence of London, should the Spaniards land. Leicester vigorously counteracted the disorganisation he found everywhere, having few illusions about &quot;all sudden hurley-burleys&quot;, as he wrote to Walsingham. When the Privy Council was already considering disbanding the camp to save money, Leicester held against it, setting about to plan with the Queen a visit to her troops. On the day she gave her famous speech he walked beside her horse, bare-headed.

After the Armada, the Earl was seen riding in splendour through London &quot;as if he were a king&quot;, and for the last few weeks of his life he usually dined with the Queen, a unique favour. On his way to Buxton in Derbyshire to take the baths, he died at Cornbury Park near Oxford, on 4 September 1588. Leicester&#x27;s health had not been good for some time; historians have considered malaria and stomach cancer as causes of death. His death came unexpectedly, and only a week earlier he had said farewell to Elizabeth. She was deeply affected and locked herself in her apartment for a few days until Lord Burghley had the door broken. Her nickname for Dudley had been &quot;Eyes&quot;, which was symbolised by the sign of ôô in their letters to each other. Elizabeth kept the letter he had sent her six days before his death in her bedside treasure box, endorsing it with &quot;his last letter&quot; on the outside. It was still there when she died 15 years later on 24 March 1603.

Leicester was buried, as he had requested, in the Beauchamp Chapel of the Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick on 10 October 1588—in the same chapel as Richard Beauchamp, his ancestor, and the &quot;noble Impe&quot;, his little son. Countess Lettice was also buried there when she died in 1634, alongside the &quot;best and dearest of husbands&quot;, as the epitaph, which she commissioned, says.

==Historiographical treatment==
The book which later became known as &quot;Leicester&#x27;s Commonwealth&quot; was written by Catholic exiles in Paris and printed anonymously in 1584. It was published shortly after the death of Leicester&#x27;s son, which is alluded to in a stop-press marginal note: &quot;The children of adulterers shall be consumed, and the seed of a wicked bed shall be rooted out.&quot; Smuggled into England, the libel became a best-seller with underground booksellers and the next year was translated into French. Its underlying political agenda is the succession of Mary, Queen of Scots, to the English throne, but its most outstanding feature is an all-round attack on the Earl of Leicester. He is presented as an atheistic, hypocritical coward, a &quot;perpetuall Dictator&quot;, terrorising the Queen and ruining the whole country. He is engaged in a long-term conspiracy to snatch the Crown from Elizabeth in order to settle it first on his brother-in-law, the Earl of Huntingdon, and ultimately on himself. Spicy details of his monstrous private life are revealed, and he appears as an expert poisoner of many high-profile personalities. This influential classic is the origin of many aspects of Leicester&#x27;s historical reputation. Similar conspiracies are often mentioned in coded letters from Mary, Queen of Scots, to the French ambassador.

In the early 17th century, William Camden saw &quot;some secret constellation&quot; of the stars at work between Elizabeth and her favourite; he firmly established the legend of the perfect courtier with the sinister influence. Some of the most often-quoted characterisations of Leicester, such as that he &quot;was wont to put up all his passions in his pocket&quot;, his nickname of &quot;the Gypsy&quot;, and Elizabeth&#x27;s &quot;I will have here but one mistress and no master&quot;-reprimand to him, were contributed by Sir Henry Wotton and Sir Robert Naunton almost half a century after the Earl&#x27;s death.

The Victorian historian James Anthony Froude saw Robert Dudley as Elizabeth&#x27;s soft plaything, combining &quot;in himself the worst qualities of both sexes. Without courage, without talent, without virtue&quot;. The habit of comparing him unfavourably to William Cecil was continued by Conyers Read in 1925: &quot;Leicester was a selfish, unscrupulous courtier and Burghley a wise and patriotic statesman&quot;. Geoffrey Elton, in his widely read &quot;England under the Tudors&quot; (1955), saw Dudley as &quot;a handsome, vigorous man with very little sense.&quot;

Since the 1950s, academic assessment of the Earl of Leicester has undergone considerable changes. Leicester&#x27;s importance in literary patronage was established by Eleanor Rosenberg in 1955. Elizabethan Puritanism has been thoroughly reassessed since the 1960s, and Patrick Collinson has outlined the Earl&#x27;s place in it. Dudley&#x27;s religion could thus be better understood, rather than simply to brand him as a hypocrite. His importance as a privy councillor and statesman has often been overlooked, one reason being that many of his letters are scattered among private collections and not easily accessible in print, as are those of his colleagues Walsingham and Cecil. Alan Haynes describes him as &quot;one of the most strangely underrated of Elizabeth&#x27;s circle of close advisers&quot;, while Simon Adams, who since the early 1970s has researched many aspects of Leicester&#x27;s life and career, concludes: &quot;Leicester was as central a figure to the &#x27;first reign&#x27; [of Elizabeth] as Burghley.&quot;

<text>The Peace of Thorn or Toruń of 1466, also known as the Second Peace of Thorn or Toruń (; ), was a peace treaty signed in the Hanseatic city of Thorn (Toruń) on 19 October 1466 between the Polish king Casimir IV Jagiellon and the Teutonic Knights, which ended the Thirteen Years&#x27; War, the longest of the Polish–Teutonic Wars.

The treaty was signed in the Artus Court, and afterward a mass was held in the Gothic Franciscan Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary to celebrate the peace treaty.

==Background==
The treaty concluded the Thirteen Years&#x27; War which had begun in February 1454 with the revolt of the Prussian Confederation, led by the cities of Danzig (Gdańsk), Elbing (Elbląg), Kulm (Chełmno) and Toruń, and the Prussian gentry against the rule of the Teutonic Knights in the Monastic State, in order to join the Kingdom of Poland.

Both sides agreed to seek confirmation from Pope Paul II and Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III, but the Polish side stressed (and the Teutonic side agreed) that this confirmation would not be needed for validation of the treaty. The peace talks were held in Nieszawa (present-day Mała Nieszawka) from 23 September 1466, and in the final stages moved to Toruń.

==Terms==

In the treaty, the Teutonic Order renounced any claims to the territories of Gdańsk/Eastern Pomerania and Chełmno Land, which were reintegrated with Poland, and the region of Elbing (Elbląg) and Marienburg (Malbork), and the Bishopric of Warmia, which were also recognized as part of Poland. The eastern part remained with the Teutonic Order as a fief and protectorate of Poland, also considered an integral part of the &quot;one and indivisible&quot; Kingdom of Poland. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Chełmno became a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Gniezno.

From now on, every Grand Master of the Teutonic Order was obliged to swear an oath of allegiance to the reigning Polish king within six months of taking office, and any new territorial acquisitions by the Teutonic Order, also outside Prussia, would also be incorporated into Poland. The Grand Master became a prince and counselor of the Polish king and the Kingdom of Poland. Poles were to be admitted to the Teutonic Order. The Teutonic Knights were obliged to help Poland in the event of war, and were forbidden to wage war against Catholics without the consent of Polish kings. Any prisoners of war on both sides were to be released.

The treaty also dismissed any possibility of releasing the Teutonic Order from dependence to Poland or of any revision of the terms of the treaty by referring to any foreign authority, including imperial and papal.

==Outcome==

The territories directly held by Poland were already organized into three voivodeships (Chełmno, Pomeranian, Malbork) and the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia, all of which formed the province of Royal Prussia (later also part of the larger Greater Poland Provincen), which was considered the exclusive property of the Polish king and Polish kingdom. Later, some disagreements arose concerning certain prerogatives that Royal Prussia and the cities held, like Danzig&#x27;s privileges. The region possessed certain privileges such as the minting of its own coins, its own Diet meetings (see the Prussian estates), its own military, and its own administrative usage of the German language for minority. A conflict over the right to name and approve Bishops in Warmia, resulted in the War of the Priests (1467–1479). Eventually, Royal Prussia became integrated into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, but retained some distinctive features until the partitions of Poland in the late 18th century.

In 1525, the Order was ousted from their territory by its own Grand Master when Albert, Duke of Prussia adopted Lutheranism and assumed the title of duke as hereditary ruler under the overlordship of Poland in the Prussian Homage. The area became known as the Duchy of Prussia.

<text>Paleoclimatology (British spelling, palaeoclimatology) is the scientific study of climates predating the invention of meteorological instruments, when no direct measurement data were available. As instrumental records only span a tiny part of Earth&#x27;s history, the reconstruction of ancient climate is important to understand natural variation and the evolution of the current climate.

Paleoclimatology uses a variety of proxy methods from Earth and life sciences to obtain data previously preserved within rocks, sediments, boreholes, ice sheets, tree rings, corals, shells, and microfossils. Combined with techniques to date the proxies, the paleoclimate records are used to determine the past states of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

The scientific field of paleoclimatology came to maturity in the 20th century. Notable periods studied by paleoclimatologists include the frequent glaciations that Earth has undergone, rapid cooling events like the Younger Dryas, and the rapid warming during the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum. Studies of past changes in the environment and biodiversity often reflect on the current situation, specifically the impact of climate on mass extinctions and biotic recovery and current global warming.

==History==

Notions of a changing climate most likely evolved in ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley and China, where prolonged periods of droughts and floods were experienced. In the seventeenth century, Robert Hooke postulated that fossils of giant turtles found in Dorset could only be explained by a once warmer climate, which he thought could be explained by a shift in Earth&#x27;s axis. Fossils were, at that time, often explained as a consequence of a biblical flood. Systematic observations of sunspots started by amateur astronomer Heinrich Schwabe in the early 19th century, starting a discussion of the Sun&#x27;s influence on Earth&#x27;s climate.

The scientific study of paleoclimatology began to take shape in the early 19th century, when discoveries about glaciations and natural changes in Earth&#x27;s past climate helped to understand the greenhouse effect. It was only in the 20th century that paleoclimatology became a unified scientific field. Before, different aspects of Earth&#x27;s climate history were studied by a variety of disciplines. At the end of the 20th century, the empirical research into Earth&#x27;s ancient climates started to be combined with computer models of increasing complexity. A new objective also developed in this period: finding ancient analog climates that could provide information about current climate change.

==Reconstructing ancient climates==


Paleoclimatologists employ a wide variety of techniques to deduce ancient climates. The techniques used depend on which variable has to be reconstructed (this could be temperature, precipitation, or something else) and how long ago the climate of interest occurred. For instance, the deep marine record, the source of most isotopic data, exists only on oceanic plates, which are eventually subducted; the oldest remaining material is old. Older sediments are also more prone to corruption by diagenesis. This is due to the millions of years of disruption experienced by the rock formations, such as pressure, tectonic activity, and fluid flowing. These factors often result in a lack in quality or quantity of data, which causes resolution and confidence in the data decrease over time.

Specific techniques used to make inferences on ancient climate conditions are the use of lake sediment cores and speleothems. These utilize an analysis of sediment layers and rock growth formations respectively, amongst element-dating methods utilizing oxygen, carbon and uranium.

===Proxies for climate===

====Direct Quantitative Measurements====
The Direct Quantitative Measurements method is the most direct approach to understand the change in a climate. Comparisons between recent data to older data allows a researcher to gain a basic understanding of weather and climate changes within an area. There is a disadvantage to this method. Data of the climate only started being recorded in the mid-1800s. This means that researchers can only utilize 150 years of data. That is not helpful when trying to map the climate of an area 10,000 years ago. This is where more complex methods can be used. 

====Ice====
Mountain glaciers and the polar ice caps/ice sheets provide much data in paleoclimatology. Ice-coring projects in the ice caps of Greenland and Antarctica have yielded data going back several hundred thousand years, over 800,000 years in the case of the EPICA project.

* Air trapped within fallen snow becomes encased in tiny bubbles as the snow is compressed into ice in the glacier under the weight of later years&#x27; snow. The trapped air has proven a tremendously valuable source for direct measurement of the composition of air from the time the ice was formed.
* Layering can be observed because of seasonal pauses in ice accumulation and can be used to establish chronology, associating specific depths of the core with ranges of time.
* Changes in the layering thickness can be used to determine changes in precipitation or temperature.
* Oxygen-18 quantity changes () in ice layers represent changes in average ocean surface temperature. Water molecules containing the heavier O-18 evaporate at a higher temperature than water molecules containing the normal Oxygen-16 isotope. The ratio of O-18 to O-16 will be higher as temperature increases but it also depends on factors such as water salinity and the volume of water locked up in ice sheets. Various cycles in isotope ratios have been detected.
* Pollen has been observed in the ice cores and can be used to understand which plants were present as the layer formed. Pollen is produced in abundance and its distribution is typically well understood. A pollen count for a specific layer can be produced by observing the total amount of pollen categorized by type (shape) in a controlled sample of that layer. Changes in plant frequency over time can be plotted through statistical analysis of pollen counts in the core. Knowing which plants were present leads to an understanding of precipitation and temperature, and types of fauna present. Palynology includes the study of pollen for these purposes.
* Volcanic ash is contained in some layers, and can be used to establish the time of the layer&#x27;s formation. Volcanic events distribute ash with a unique set of properties (shape and color of particles, chemical signature). Establishing the ash&#x27;s source will give a time period to associate with the layer of ice.

A multinational consortium, the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA), has drilled an ice core in Dome C on the East Antarctic ice sheet and retrieved ice from roughly 800,000 years ago. The international ice core community has, under the auspices of International Partnerships in Ice Core Sciences (IPICS), defined a priority project to obtain the oldest possible ice core record from Antarctica, an ice core record reaching back to or towards 1.5 million years ago.

====Dendroclimatology====

Climatic information can be obtained through an understanding of changes in tree growth. Generally, trees respond to changes in climatic variables by speeding up or slowing down growth, which in turn is generally reflected by a greater or lesser thickness in growth rings. Different species, however, respond to changes in climatic variables in different ways. A tree-ring record is established by compiling information from many living trees in a specific area. This is done by comparing the number, thickness, ring boundaries, and pattern matching of tree growth rings.

The differences in thickness displayed in the growth rings in trees can often indicate the quality of conditions in the environment, and the fitness of the tree species evaluated. Different species of trees will display different growth responses to the changes in the climate. An evaluation of multiple trees within the same species, along with one of trees in different species, will allow for a more accurate analysis of the changing variables within the climate and how they affected the surrounding species.

Older intact wood that has escaped decay can extend the time covered by the record by matching the ring depth changes to contemporary specimens. By using that method, some areas have tree-ring records dating back a few thousand years. Older wood not connected to a contemporary record can be dated generally with radiocarbon techniques. A tree-ring record can be used to produce information regarding precipitation, temperature, hydrology, and fire corresponding to a particular area.

====Sedimentary content====
On a longer time scale, geologists must refer to the sedimentary record for data.

* Sediments, sometimes lithified to form rock, may contain remnants of preserved vegetation, animals, plankton, or pollen, which may be characteristic of certain climatic zones.
* Biomarker molecules such as the alkenones may yield information about their temperature of formation.
* Chemical signatures, particularly Mg/Ca ratio of calcite in Foraminifera tests, can be used to reconstruct past temperature.
* Isotopic ratios can provide further information. Specifically, the record responds to changes in temperature and ice volume, and the record reflects a range of factors, which are often difficult to disentangle.
;Sedimentary facies
On a longer time scale, the rock record may show signs of sea level rise and fall, and features such as &quot;fossilised&quot; sand dunes can be identified. Scientists can get a grasp of long-term climate by studying sedimentary rock going back billions of years. The division of Earth history into separate periods is largely based on visible changes in sedimentary rock layers that demarcate major changes in conditions. Often, they include major shifts in climate.

====Sclerochronology====

;Corals (see also sclerochronology)
Coral “rings&quot; share similar evidence of growth to that of trees, and thus can be dated in similar ways. A primary difference is their environments and the conditions within those that they respond to. Examples of these conditions for coral include water temperature, freshwater influx, changes in pH, and wave disturbances. From there, specialized equipment, such as the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument, can be used to derive the sea surface temperature and water salinity from the past few centuries. The δ18O of coralline red algae provides a useful proxy of the combined sea surface temperature and sea surface salinity at high latitudes and the tropics, where many traditional techniques are limited.

====Landscapes and landforms====
Within climatic geomorphology, one approach is to study relict landforms to infer ancient climates. Being often concerned about past climates climatic geomorphology is considered sometimes to be a theme of historical geology. Evidence of these past climates to be studied can be found in the landforms they leave behind. Examples of these landforms are those such as glacial landforms (moraines, striations), desert features (dunes, desert pavements), and coastal landforms (marine terraces, beach ridges). Climatic geomorphology is of limited use to study recent (Quaternary, Holocene) large climate changes since there are seldom discernible in the geomorphological record.

===Timing of proxies===
The field of geochronology has scientists working on determining how old certain proxies are. For recent proxy archives of tree rings and corals the individual year rings can be counted, and an exact year can be determined. Radiometric dating uses the properties of radioactive elements in proxies. In older material, more of the radioactive material will have decayed and the proportion of different elements will be different from newer proxies. One example of radiometric dating is radiocarbon dating. In the air, cosmic rays constantly convert nitrogen into a specific radioactive carbon isotope, 14C. When plants then use this carbon to grow, this isotope is not replenished anymore and starts decaying. The proportion of &#x27;normal&#x27; carbon and Carbon-14 gives information of how long the plant material has not been in contact with the atmosphere.

==Notable climate events in Earth history==
Knowledge of precise climatic events decreases as the record goes back in time, but some notable climate events are known:
* Faint young Sun paradox (start)
* Huronian glaciation (~2400 Mya Earth completely covered in ice probably due to Great Oxygenation Event)
* Later Neoproterozoic Snowball Earth (~600 Mya, precursor to the Cambrian Explosion)
* Andean-Saharan glaciation (~450 Mya)
* Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse (~300 Mya)
* Permian–Triassic extinction event (251.9 Mya)
* Oceanic anoxic events (~120 Mya, 93 Mya, and others)
* Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event ( Mya)
* Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (Paleocene–Eocene, 55Mya)
* Last Glacial Maximum (~23,000 BCE)
* Younger Dryas/Big Freeze (~11,000 BCE)
* Holocene climatic optimum (~7000–3000 BCE)
* Extreme weather events of 535–536 (535–536 CE)
* Medieval Warm Period (900–1300)
* Little Ice Age (1300–1800)
* Year Without a Summer (1816)

==History of the atmosphere==

===Earliest atmosphere===
The first atmosphere would have consisted of gases in the solar nebula, primarily hydrogen. In addition, there would probably have been simple hydrides such as those now found in gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn, notably water vapor, methane, and ammonia. As the solar nebula dissipated, the gases would have escaped, partly driven off by the solar wind.

===Second atmosphere===
The next atmosphere, consisting largely of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and inert gases, was produced by outgassing from volcanism, supplemented by gases produced during the late heavy bombardment of Earth by huge asteroids. A major part of carbon dioxide emissions were soon dissolved in water and built up carbonate sediments.

Water-related sediments have been found dating from as early as 3.8 billion years ago. About 3.4 billion years ago, nitrogen was the major part of the then stable &quot;second atmosphere&quot;. An influence of life has to be taken into account rather soon in the history of the atmosphere because hints of early life forms have been dated to as early as 3.5 to 4.3 billion years ago. The fact that it is not perfectly in line with the 30% lower solar radiance (compared to today) of the early Sun has been described as the &quot;faint young Sun paradox&quot;.

The geological record, however, shows a continually relatively warm surface during the complete early temperature record of Earth with the exception of one cold glacial phase about 2.4 billion years ago. In the late Archaean eon, an oxygen-containing atmosphere began to develop, apparently from photosynthesizing cyanobacteria (see Great Oxygenation Event) which have been found as stromatolite fossils from 2.7 billion years ago. The early basic carbon isotopy (isotope ratio proportions) was very much in line with what is found today, suggesting that the fundamental features of the carbon cycle were established as early as 4 billion years ago.

===Third atmosphere===
The constant rearrangement of continents by plate tectonics influences the long-term evolution of the atmosphere by transferring carbon dioxide to and from large continental carbonate stores. Free oxygen did not exist in the atmosphere until about 2.4 billion years ago, during the Great Oxygenation Event, and its appearance is indicated by the end of the banded iron formations. Until then, any oxygen produced by photosynthesis was consumed by oxidation of reduced materials, notably iron. Molecules of free oxygen did not start to accumulate in the atmosphere until the rate of production of oxygen began to exceed the availability of reducing materials. That point was a shift from a reducing atmosphere to an oxidizing atmosphere. O2 showed major variations until reaching a steady state of more than 15% by the end of the Precambrian. The following time span was the Phanerozoic eon, during which oxygen-breathing metazoan life forms began to appear.

The amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has fluctuated over the last 600 million years, reaching a peak of 35% during the Carboniferous period, significantly higher than today&#x27;s 21%. Two main processes govern changes in the atmosphere: plants use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, releasing oxygen and the breakdown of pyrite and volcanic eruptions release sulfur into the atmosphere, which oxidizes and hence reduces the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, volcanic eruptions also release carbon dioxide, which plants can convert to oxygen. The exact cause of the variation of the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is not known. Periods with much oxygen in the atmosphere are associated with rapid development of animals. Today&#x27;s atmosphere contains 21% oxygen, which is high enough for rapid development of animals.

==Climate during geological ages==
* The Huronian glaciation, is the first known glaciation in Earth&#x27;s history, and lasted from 2400 to 2100 million years ago.
* The Cryogenian glaciation lasted from 720 to 635 million years ago.
* The Andean-Saharan glaciation lasted from 450 to 420 million years ago.
* The Karoo glaciation lasted from 360 to 260 million years ago.
* The Quaternary glaciation is the current glaciation period and began 2.58 million years ago.

In 2020 scientists published a continuous, high-fidelity record of variations in Earth&#x27;s climate during the past 66 million years and identified four climate states, separated by transitions that include changing greenhouse gas levels and polar ice sheets volumes. They integrated data of various sources. The warmest climate state since the time of the dinosaur extinction, &quot;Hothouse&quot;, endured from 56 Mya to 47 Mya and was ~14 °C warmer than average modern temperatures.

===Precambrian climate===

The Precambrian took place between the time when Earth first formed 4.6 billion years (Ga) ago, and 542 million years ago. The Precambrian can be split into two eons, the Archean and the Proterozoic, which can be further subdivided into eras. The reconstruction of the Precambrian climate is difficult for various reasons including the low number of reliable indicators and a, generally, not well-preserved or extensive fossil record (especially when compared to the Phanerozoic eon). Despite these issues, there is evidence for a number of major climate events throughout the history of the Precambrian: The Great Oxygenation Event, which started around 2.3 Ga ago (the beginning of the Proterozoic) is indicated by biomarkers which demonstrate the appearance of photosynthetic organisms. Due to the high levels of oxygen in the atmosphere from the GOE, CH4 levels fell rapidly cooling the atmosphere causing the Huronian glaciation. For about 1 Ga after the glaciation (2-0.8 Ga ago), the Earth likely experienced warmer temperatures indicated by microfossils of photosynthetic eukaryotes, and oxygen levels between 5 and 18% of the Earth&#x27;s current oxygen level. At the end of the Proterozoic, there is evidence of global glaciation events of varying severity causing a &#x27;Snowball Earth&#x27;. Snowball Earth is supported by different indicators such as, glacial deposits, significant continental erosion called the Great Unconformity, and sedimentary rocks called cap carbonates that form after a deglaciation episode. 

===Phanerozoic climate===
Major drivers for the preindustrial ages have been variations of the Sun, volcanic ashes and exhalations, relative movements of the Earth towards the Sun, and tectonically induced effects as for major sea currents, watersheds, and ocean oscillations. In the early Phanerozoic, increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have been linked to driving or amplifying increased global temperatures. Royer et al. 2004 found a climate sensitivity for the rest of the Phanerozoic which was calculated to be similar to today&#x27;s modern range of values.

The difference in global mean temperatures between a fully glacial Earth and an ice free Earth is estimated at 10 °C, though far larger changes would be observed at high latitudes and smaller ones at low latitudes. One requirement for the development of large scale ice sheets seems to be the arrangement of continental land masses at or near the poles. The constant rearrangement of continents by plate tectonics can also shape long-term climate evolution. However, the presence or absence of land masses at the poles is not sufficient to guarantee glaciations or exclude polar ice caps. Evidence exists of past warm periods in Earth&#x27;s climate when polar land masses similar to Antarctica were home to deciduous forests rather than ice sheets.

The relatively warm local minimum between Jurassic and Cretaceous goes along with an increase of subduction and mid-ocean ridge volcanism due to the breakup of the Pangea supercontinent.

Superimposed on the long-term evolution between hot and cold climates have been many short-term fluctuations in climate similar to, and sometimes more severe than, the varying glacial and interglacial states of the present ice age. Some of the most severe fluctuations, such as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, may be related to rapid climate changes due to sudden collapses of natural methane clathrate reservoirs in the oceans.

A similar, single event of induced severe climate change after a meteorite impact has been proposed as reason for the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. Other major thresholds are the Permian-Triassic, and Ordovician-Silurian extinction events with various reasons suggested.

===Quaternary climate===


The Quaternary geological period includes the current climate. There has been a cycle of ice ages for the past 2.2–2.1 million years (starting before the Quaternary in the late Neogene Period).

Note in the graphic on the right the strong 120,000-year periodicity of the cycles, and the striking asymmetry of the curves. This asymmetry is believed to result from complex interactions of feedback mechanisms. It has been observed that ice ages deepen by progressive steps, but the recovery to interglacial conditions occurs in one big step.

The graph on the left shows the temperature change over the past 12,000 years, from various sources; the thick black curve is an average.

==Climate forcings==

Climate forcing is the difference between radiant energy (sunlight) received by the Earth and the outgoing longwave radiation back to space. Such radiative forcing is quantified based on the amount in the tropopause, in units of watts per square meter to the Earth&#x27;s surface. Dependent on the radiative balance of incoming and outgoing energy, the Earth either warms up or cools down. Earth radiative balance originates from changes in solar insolation and the concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols. Climate change may be due to internal processes in Earth sphere&#x27;s and/or following external forcings.

One example of a way this can be applied to study climatology is analyzing how the varying concentrations of CO2 affect the overall climate. This is done by using various proxies to estimate past greenhouse gas concentrations and compare those to that of the present day. Researchers are then able to assess their role in progression of climate change throughout Earth’s history.

===Internal processes and forcings===
The Earth&#x27;s climate system involves the atmosphere, biosphere, cryosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere, and the sum of these processes from Earth&#x27;s spheres is what affects the climate. Greenhouse gasses act as the internal forcing of the climate system. Particular interests in climate science and paleoclimatology focus on the study of Earth climate sensitivity, in response to the sum of forcings. Analyzing the sum of these forcings contributes to the ability of scientists to make broad conclusive estimates on the Earth’s climate system. These estimates include the evidence for systems such as long term climate variability (eccentricity, obliquity precession), feedback mechanisms (Ice-Albedo Effect), and anthropogenic influence.

Examples:

===External forcings===
* The Milankovitch cycles determine Earth distance and position to the Sun. The solar insolation is the total amount of solar radiation received by Earth.
* Volcanic eruptions are considered an internal forcing.
* Human changes of the composition of the atmosphere or land use.
* Human activities causing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions leading to global warming and associated climate changes.
* Large asteroids that have cataclysmic impacts on Earth’s climate are considered external forcings.

===Mechanisms===
On timescales of millions of years, the uplift of mountain ranges and subsequent weathering processes of rocks and soils and the subduction of tectonic plates, are an important part of the carbon cycle. The weathering sequesters, by the reaction of minerals with chemicals (especially silicate weathering with ) and thereby removing from the atmosphere and reducing the radiative forcing. The opposite effect is volcanism, responsible for the natural greenhouse effect, by emitting into the atmosphere, thus affecting glaciation (Ice Age) cycles. Jim Hansen suggested that humans emit 10,000 times faster than natural processes have done in the past.

Ice sheet dynamics and continental positions (and linked vegetation changes) have been important factors in the long term evolution of the Earth&#x27;s climate. There is also a close correlation between and temperature, where has a strong control over global temperatures in Earth&#x27;s history.

<text>Charles Lapworth FRS FGS (20 September 1842 – 13 March 1920) was a headteacher and an English geologist who pioneered faunal analysis using index fossils and identified the Ordovician period.

== Biography ==
Charles Lapworth was born at Faringdon in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire) the son of James Lapworth.

He trained as a teacher at the Culham Diocesan Training College near Abingdon, Oxfordshire. He moved to the Scottish border region, where he investigated the previously little-known fossil fauna of the area. He was headmaster of the school in Galashiels from 1864 to 1875. In 1869 he married Janet, daughter of Galashiels schoolmaster Walter Sanderson.

Through mapping and innovative use of index fossil analysis, based on a sequence exposed at Dob&#x27;s Linn, Lapworth showed that what was thought to be a thick sequence of Silurian rocks was in fact a much thinner series of rocks repeated by faulting and folding.


He completed this pioneering research in the Southern Uplands while employed as a schoolmaster for 11 years at the Episcopal Church school, Galashiels. He then studied geology and became in 1875 an assistant at Madras College in St Andrews, Fife, and then in 1881 the first professor of geology at Mason Science College, later the University of Birmingham, where he taught until his retirement in 1913.

He is best known for pioneering faunal analysis of Silurian beds by means of index fossils, especially graptolites, and his proposal (eventually adopted) that the beds between the Cambrian beds of north Wales and the Silurian beds of South Wales should be assigned to a new geological period: the Ordovician. He resolved the long running &quot;Highlands Controversy. Lapworth received numerous awards for his research work, while for teaching he used the English Midlands as a setting for demonstrating the fieldwork techniques he had pioneered in his own research.
Following his researches in the Southern Uplands Charles Lapworth also devoted time to mapping near Durness in Scotland&#x27;s northwest highlands and was first to propose the controversial theory that here older rocks were found lying above younger, suggesting complex folding or faulting as a cause. Later Peach and Horne were dispatched to the area and their monumental memoir proved Lapworth correct. In the English Midlands he carried out important work in Shropshire, in particular identifying fossils of Olenelloid trilobites of Cambrian age, demonstrating that Cambrian rocks underlay the Carboniferous rocks between Nuneaton and Atherstone, and suggesting a pre-Cambrian date for the Longmyndian rocks that underlay them. He extrapolated these findings to the N.W. Highlands of Scotland, suggesting that the Torridonian sandstone might correspond to the Longmyndian rocks, and thus be pre-Cambrian rather than Cambrian, and that the Durness-Eriboll series, overlaying the Torridonian, would be of Cambrian age rather than Silurian. Again Peach and Horne, surveying in Dundonnell Forest, confirmed Lapworths&#x27;s suggestion, finding Olenelloid fossils in the fucoid beds of the Durness-Eriboll series. For a modern account and discussion of the elucidation of the geology of the N.W. Highlands, see Oldroyd (1990).

He died on 13 March 1920 and is buried in Lodge Hill Cemetery near Birmingham.

==Family==

He married Janet Sanderson in 1869.

The couple had five children in total. The first and last born children died during infancy; Ernest, born 22 January 1871 and died 6 February 1871, and Walter Sanderson Lapworth, born in 1882 and died in 1884 before his second birthday. The children who survived to adulthood were Arthur (born c. 1873), Herbert (born c. 1876), and Edith Matilda (born c. 1879). Arthur Lapworth became a renowned chemist and Herbert a civil engineer, engineering geologist, stratigrapher and palaeontologist.

== Honours and awards ==
Lapworth received many awards for his work and contributions to geology. In June 1888 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 1891 was awarded their Royal Medal. In 1899, he received the highest award of the Geological Society of London, the Wollaston Medal, in recognition of his outstanding work in the Southern Uplands, and Northwest Highlands of Scotland. There years later, in February 1902, he was elected President of the Geological Society for the years 1902–1904.

The glacial Lake Lapworth, was named for him by Leonard Johnston Wills in recognition of his original suggestion of its existence in 1898.

Aberdeen University awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1884 and Glasgow University in 1912 (both LLD).

In 1916 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

== Lapworth Museum of Geology ==
Papers relating to Charles Lapworth can be found at the University of Birmingham in the Lapworth Museum of Geology, located within the Aston Webb building on the main Edgbaston campus. The Lapworth Archive contains a remarkably complete record of all areas of his research work and teaching. In August 2021 an Archives Revealed funded project began to catalogue and promote Lapworth&#x27;s archive, which is due to be completed in January 2023.

<text>A remotely guided rat, popularly called a ratbot or robo-rat, is a rat with electrodes implanted in the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) and sensorimotor cortex of its brain. They were developed in 2002 by Sanjiv Talwar and John Chapin at the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center. The rats wear a small electronics backpack containing a radio receiver and electrical stimulator. The rat receives remote stimulation in the sensorimotor cortex via its backpack that causes the rat to feel a sensation in its left or right whiskers, and stimulation in the MFB that is interpreted as a reward or pleasure.

After a period of training and conditioning using MFB stimulation as a reward, the rats can be remotely directed to move left, right, and forward in response to whisker stimulation signals. It is possible to roughly guide the animal along an obstacle course, jumping small gaps and scaling obstacles.
==Ethics==
Concerns have been raised by animal rights groups about the use of animals in this context, particularly due to a concern about the removal of autonomy from an independent creature. For example, a spokesman of the Dr Hadwen Trust, a group funding alternatives to animal research in medicine, has said that the experiments are an &quot;appalling example of how the human species instrumentalizes other species.&quot;

Researchers tend to liken the training mechanism of the robo-rat to standard operant conditioning techniques. Talwar himself has acknowledged the ethical issues apparent in the development of the robo-rat, but points out that the research meets standards for animal treatment laid down by the National Institute of Health. Moreover, the researchers emphasize that the animals are trained, not coerced, into particular behaviors. Because the rats are encouraged to act via the reward of pleasure, not muscularly compelled to behave in a particular manner, their behavior under MFB stimulation is likened to a carrot-and-stick model of encouraged behavior versus a system of mind control. It seems unlikely that the rats could be persuaded to knowingly risk their lives even with this stimulation. &quot;Our animals were completely happy and treated well,&quot; Talwar stated.

The technology is reminiscent of experiments performed in 1965 by Dr. Jose Delgado, a controversial scientist who was able to pacify a charging bull via electrodes fitted in its brain. He was also said to control cats and monkeys like &quot;electronic toys.&quot; Doctor Robert Galbraith Heath also placed electrodes deep into the brains of patients and wrote hundreds of medical papers on his work.

<text>Francesco Foscari (19 June 1373 – 1 November 1457) was the 65th Doge of the Republic of Venice from 1423 to 1457. His reign, the longest of all Doges in Venetian history, lasted 34 years, 6 months and 8 days, and coincided with the inception of the Italian Renaissance.

==Biography==

Francesco Foscari was born in 1373, as the oldest son of Nicolò Foscari and his wife Cateruzia Michiel. The Foscari family had been of only moderate importance, but had managed to become one of the few noble families that secured a hereditary place in the Great Council of Venice after the so-called &quot;Serrata&quot; (&quot;Closing&quot;) of the Great Council, and had begun to rise in prominence throughout the 14th century. Francesco&#x27;s ancestors began holding high public office, and his father Nicolò even became a member of the powerful Council of Ten.

Francesco served the Republic of Venice in numerous official capacities—as ambassador, president of the Council of Forty, member of the Council of Ten, inquisitor, Procurator of St Mark&#x27;s, &quot;avogador de comùn&quot;— before he was elected in 1423 defeating the other candidate, Pietro Loredan. His task as doge was to lead Venice in a long and protracted series of wars against Milan, governed by the Visconti, who were attempting to dominate all of northern Italy. Despite the justification of Venetian embroilment in the terraferma that was offered in Foscari&#x27;s funeral oration, delivered by the humanist senator and historian Bernardo Giustiniani, and some victories, the war was extremely costly to Venice, whose real source of wealth and power was at sea. Venice, which during Foscari&#x27;s leadership abandoned her ally Florence, was eventually overcome by the forces of Milan under the leadership of Francesco Sforza. Sforza soon made peace with Florence, however, leaving Venice alone.
Foscari was married twice: first to Maria Priuli, and then in 1415 to Marina Nani. In 1445, his only surviving son, Jacopo, was tried by the Council of Ten on charges of bribery and corruption and exiled from the city. Two further trials, in 1450 and 1456 – during the latter he confessed, without even the need of torture, to having pleaded for help from the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II and the aforementioned Duke of Milan, both Venice&#x27;s enemies – led to Jacopo&#x27;s imprisonment on Crete and his eventual death there soon after.

News of Jacopo&#x27;s death caused Foscari to withdraw from his government duties, and in October 1457 the Council of Ten forced him to abdicate. However, his death a week later provoked such public outcry that he was given a state funeral.

Beside his profile portrait by Lazzaro Bastiani, Foscari commissioned a bas-relief bronze plaquette from Donatello, which survives in several examples. His figure kneeling in prayer to St Mark figured over the portal to the Doge&#x27;s Palace until it was dismantled by order of the revolutionary government, 1797; the head was preserved and is conserved in the Museo dell&#x27;Opera di Palazzo Ducale. His monument by the sculptor Antonio Bregno in collaboration with his architect brother Paolo was erected in the church of Santa Maria dei Frari in Venice.
He was deposed from office on 27 October 1457 and died five days after.

==In literature and opera==
Foscari&#x27;s life was the subject of a play &quot;The Two Foscari&quot; by Lord Byron (1821) and an episode in Samuel Rogers&#x27; long poem &quot;Italy&quot;. The Byron play served as the basis for the libretto written by Francesco Maria Piave for Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;I due Foscari&quot;, which premiered on 3 November 1844 in Rome. Mary Mitford, author of the popular literary sketches of the English countryside entitled &quot;Our Village&quot;, also wrote a successful play concerned with events in Foscari&#x27;s life. Mitford&#x27;s play &quot;Foscari&quot; debuted at Covent Garden in 1826 with famed actor Charles Kemble in the lead.

<text>The Battle of the Crater took place during the American Civil War, part of the Siege of Petersburg. It occurred on Saturday, July 30, 1864, between the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, commanded by General Robert E. Lee, and the Union Army of the Potomac, commanded by Major General George G. Meade (under the direct supervision of the general-in-chief, Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant).

After weeks of preparation, on July 30 Union forces exploded a mine across from Union Major General Ambrose E. Burnside&#x27;s IX Corps sector, blowing a gap in the Confederate defenses of Petersburg, Virginia. Instead of being a decisive advantage to the Union, this precipitated a rapid deterioration in the Union position. Unit after unit charged into and around the crater, where most of the soldiers milled in confusion in the bottom of the crater. Grant considered this failed assault as &quot;the saddest affair I have witnessed in this war.&quot;

The Confederates quickly recovered, and launched several counterattacks led by Brigadier General William Mahone. The breach was sealed off, and the Union forces were repulsed with severe casualties, while Brigadier General Edward Ferrero&#x27;s division of black soldiers was badly mauled. It may have been Grant&#x27;s best chance to end the siege of Petersburg; instead, the soldiers settled in for another eight months of trench warfare.

Burnside was relieved of command for his role in the fiasco, and he was never returned to command. Ferrero and General James H. Ledlie were observed behind the lines in a bunker, drinking liquor throughout the battle. Ledlie was criticized by a court of inquiry into his conduct that September, and in December he was effectively dismissed from the Army by Meade on orders from Grant, formally resigning his commission on January 23, 1865.

During the Civil War, Petersburg, Virginia, was an important railhead, where four railroad lines from the south met before they continued to Richmond, Virginia, the capital of the Confederacy. Most supplies to General Lee&#x27;s army and Richmond funneled through that location. Consequently, the Union regarded it as the &quot;back door&quot; to Richmond and as necessary for its defense. The result was the siege of Petersburg. It was actually trench warfare, rather than a true siege, as the armies were aligned along a series of fortified positions and trenches more than long, extending from the old Cold Harbor battlefield near Richmond to areas south of Petersburg.

After Lee stopped Grant&#x27;s attempt to seize Petersburg on June 15, the battle settled into a stalemate. Grant had learned a hard lesson at Cold Harbor about attacking Lee in a fortified position and was chafing at the inactivity to which Lee&#x27;s trenches and forts had confined him. Finally, Lt. Col. Henry Pleasants, commanding the 48th Pennsylvania Infantry of Major General Ambrose E. Burnside&#x27;s IX Corps, offered a novel proposal to break the impasse.

Pleasants, a mining engineer from Pennsylvania in civilian life, proposed digging a long mine shaft under the Confederate Army lines and planting explosive charges directly underneath a fort (Elliott&#x27;s Salient) in the middle of the Confederate First Corps line. If successful, not only would all the defenders in the area be killed, but also a hole in the Confederate defenses would be opened. If enough Union troops filled the breach quickly enough and drove into the Confederate rear area, the Confederates would not be able to muster enough force to drive them out, and Petersburg might fall. Burnside, whose reputation had suffered from his 1862 defeat at the Battle of Fredericksburg and his poor performance earlier that year at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, agreed to Pleasants&#x27;s plan.

===Mine construction===
Digging began in late June, but even Grant and Meade saw the operation as a &quot;mere way to keep the men occupied&quot; and doubted it of any actual tactical value. They quickly lost interest, and Pleasants soon found himself with few materials for his project, and his men even had to forage for wood to support the structure.

Work progressed steadily, however. Earth was removed by hand and packed into improvised sledges made from cracker boxes fitted with handles, and the floor, wall, and ceiling of the mine were shored up with timbers from an abandoned wood mill and even from tearing down an old bridge.

The shaft was elevated as it moved toward the Confederate lines to make sure moisture did not clog up the mine, and fresh air was drawn in by an ingenious air-exchange mechanism near the entrance. A canvas partition isolated the miners&#x27; air supply from outside air and allowed miners to enter and exit the work area easily. The miners had constructed a vertical exhaust shaft located well behind Union lines. At the vertical shaft&#x27;s base, a fire was kept continuously burning. A wooden duct ran the entire length of the tunnel and protruded into the outside air. The fire heated stale air inside of the tunnel, drawing it up the exhaust shaft and out of the mine by the chimney effect. The resulting vacuum then sucked fresh air in from the mine entrance via the wooden duct, which carried it down the length of the tunnel to the place in which the miners were working. That avoided the need for additional ventilation shafts, which could have been observed by the enemy, and it also easily disguised the diggers&#x27; progress.

On July 17, the main shaft reached under the Confederate position. Rumors of a mine construction soon reached the Confederates, but Lee refused to believe or act upon them for two weeks before he commenced countermining attempts, which were sluggish and uncoordinated, and were unable to discover the mine. However, General John Pegram, whose batteries would be above the explosion, took the threat seriously enough to build a new line of trenches and artillery points behind his position as a precaution. Shafts were also sunk by the Confederates in an effort to intercept the passage. Pleasants became aware of the Confederate&#x27;s counter-movements and was able to frustrate their effort by changing the direction of the main and lateral galleries while increasing their depth below the surface.

The mine was in a &quot;T&quot;-shape. The approach shaft was long, starting in a sunken area downhill and more than below the Confederate battery, making detection difficult. The tunnel entrance was narrow, about wide and high. At its end, a perpendicular gallery of extended in both directions. Grant and Meade suddenly decided to use the mine three days after it was completed after a failed attack known later as the First Battle of Deep Bottom. Union soldiers filled the mine with 320 kegs of gunpowder, totaling . The explosives were approximately under the Confederate works, and the T-gap was packed shut with of earth in the side galleries. A further of packed earth was placed in the main gallery to prevent the explosion blasting out the mouth of the mine. On July 28, the powder charges were armed.

===Preparation===
Burnside had trained a division of United States Colored Troops (USCT) under Brigadier General Edward Ferrero to lead the assault. The division consisted of two brigades, one designated to go to the left of the crater and the other to the right. A regiment from both brigades was to leave the attack column and extend the breach by rushing perpendicular to the crater, and the remaining regiments were to rush through, seizing the Jerusalem Plank Road just beyond, followed by the churchyard and, if possible, Petersburg itself. Burnside&#x27;s two other divisions, made up of white troops, would then move in, supporting Ferrero&#x27;s flanks and race for Petersburg itself. Two miles (3 km) behind the front lines, out of sight of the Confederates, the men of the USCT division were trained for two weeks on the plan.

Despite the careful planning and intensive training, on the day before the attack, Meade, who lacked confidence in the operation, ordered Burnside not to use the black troops in the lead assault. He claimed that if the attack failed, black soldiers would be killed needlessly, creating political repercussions in the North. Meade may have also ordered the change of plans because he lacked confidence in the black soldiers&#x27; abilities in combat and feared that if they were butchered, Radical Republicans would make an issue out of it and claim they were deliberately allowed to be killed. Burnside protested to Grant, who sided with Meade. When volunteers were not forthcoming, Burnside selected a replacement white division by having the three commanders draw lots. Brigadier General James H. Ledlie&#x27;s 1st Division was selected, but he failed to brief the men on what was expected of them and was reported during the battle to be drunk, well behind the lines, and not providing leadership. Ledlie would be dismissed for his actions during the battle. Ledlie, a civilian soldier with no proper military training, also commanded the smallest and weakest division in the army; one brigade was made of heavy artillery regiments that had not performed well in combat so far and Burnside himself had complained about their performance during the June 18 assaults on Petersburg. Worse than that, Ledlie was known as a coward; during the battle on June 18 he had hidden behind the lines and although his officers and enlisted men knew it, this escaped Burnside&#x27;s notice.

==Battle==

The plan called for the mine to be detonated between 3:30 and 3:45 a.m. on the morning of July 30. Pleasants lit the fuse accordingly, but as with the rest of the mine&#x27;s provisions, they had been given poor-quality fuses, which his men were forced to splice themselves. After more and more time passed and no explosion occurred (the impending dawn creating a threat to the men at the staging points, who were in view of the Confederate lines), two volunteers from the 48th Regiment (Lt. Jacob Douty and Sgt. Harry Reese) crawled into the tunnel. After discovering the fuse had burned out at a splice, they spliced on a length of new fuse and lit it again. Finally, at 4:44 a.m., the charges exploded in a massive shower of earth, men, and guns. A crater (still visible today) was created, long, wide, and at least deep.

The explosion immediately killed 278 Confederate soldiers of the 18th and 22nd South Carolina and the stunned Confederate troops did not direct any significant rifle or artillery fire at the enemy for at least 15 minutes. However, Ledlie&#x27;s untrained division was not prepared for the explosion, and reports indicate they waited 10 minutes before leaving their own entrenchments. Footbridges were supposed to have been placed to allow them to cross their own trenches quickly. Because they were missing, however, the men had to climb into and out of their own trenches just to reach no-man&#x27;s land. Once they had wandered to the crater, instead of moving around it, as the USCT troops had been trained, they thought that it would make an excellent rifle pit in which to take cover. They therefore moved down into the crater itself, wasting valuable time and realizing too late that the crater was much too deep and exposed to function as a rifle pit and quickly becoming overcrowded while the Confederates, under Brigadier General William Mahone, gathered as many troops together as they could for a counterattack. In about an hour, they had formed up around the crater and began firing rifles and artillery down into it in what Mahone later described as a &quot;turkey shoot.&quot;

Sensing that the plan had failed, Grant sent Meade an order to terminate the attack. Meade passed this order on to Burnside but the latter believed it could still work and ignored the order, so he sent in Ferrero&#x27;s division. Burnside preferred to work from his headquarters so he had only a vague idea of what was going on at the front lines as disaster was unfolding. Now faced with considerable flanking fire, the USCT also descended into the crater, and for the next few hours, Mahone&#x27;s soldiers, along with those of Major General Bushrod Johnson and artillery, slaughtered the IX Corps as Union soldiers attempted to escape from the crater or surrender. Confederates along the rim of the crater could be heard to yell &quot;Take the white man prisoner! Kill the nigger!&quot; The black Union soldiers who attempted to surrender were specifically targeted for battlefield execution or, if they were taken as prisoners, executed in the rear. Some of the officers in Ferrero&#x27;s division removed their USCT badges, fearing the Confederates would also kill them on-site if they were captured and accounts by survivors of the battle report that some bayoneted black soldiers in the hope that the Confederates would be more lenient to them if they were captured. Ferrero himself was AWOL, having joined Ledlie in the rear to drink alcohol together. Some Union troops eventually advanced and flanked to the right beyond the crater to the earthworks and assaulted the Confederate lines, driving the Confederates back for several hours in hand-to-hand combat. Mahone&#x27;s Confederates conducted a sweep out of a sunken gully area about from the right side of the Union advance. The charge reclaimed the earthworks and drove the Union force back towards the east. The Confederates rained mortar shells into the crater, killing scores of men in the process. The weather was also very hot as it neared noon the sun was beating down on the crater relentlessly. Soldiers who were not killed outright by the Confederates dropped by the dozens from dehydration and heat stroke, worsened by the frantic mob of men jammed into a small area. Survivors could remember little due to the chaos in the crater, the shell fire, and the extreme heat. Some details were organized to pick up cartridges from the dead or run back to the Union lines to fetch water.

==Aftermath==

Union casualties were 3,798 (504 killed, 1,881 wounded, 1,413 missing or captured), Confederate 1,491 (361 killed, 727 wounded, 403 missing or captured). Disproportionate Union losses were suffered by Ferrero&#x27;s division of the United States Colored Troops, many of whom were summarily executed on the battlefield or in the rear. Compared to the average ratio for Civil War battles of 4.8 wounded to one dead, for black troops at the Crater it was 1.8 to one. Both black and white wounded prisoners were taken to the Confederate hospital at Poplar Lawn, in Petersburg. Burnside had not given up hope and he petitioned Meade to let him try another attack but General E.O.C. Ord dismissed the idea as absurd. Meade brought charges against Burnside, and a subsequent court of inquiry censured him along with Brig. Gens. Ledlie, Ferrero, Orlando B. Willcox, and Col. Zenas R. Bliss. Burnside was removed from command of the IX Corps on August 26 and replaced with General John G. Parke. Although he was as responsible for the defeat as Burnside, Meade escaped immediate censure. However, in early 1865, the Congressional Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War exonerated Burnside and condemned Meade for changing the plan of attack, which did little good for Burnside, whose reputation had been ruined. As for Mahone, the victory, won largely because of his efforts in supporting Johnson&#x27;s stunned men, earned him a lasting reputation as one of the best young generals of Lee&#x27;s army in the last years of the war.

Grant wrote to Chief of Staff Henry W. Halleck, &quot;It was the saddest affair I have witnessed in this war.&quot; He also stated to Halleck, &quot;Such an opportunity for carrying fortifications I have never seen and do not expect again to have.&quot;

Pleasants, who had no role in the battle itself, received praise for his idea and its execution. When he was appointed a brevet brigadier general on March 13, 1865, the citation made explicit mention of his role.

Grant subsequently gave in his evidence before the Committee on the Conduct of the War:
Despite the battle being a tactical Confederate victory, the strategic situation in the Eastern Theater remained unchanged. Both sides remained in their trenches, and the siege continued.

==Historic site==
The area of the Battle of the Crater is a frequently-visited portion of Petersburg National Battlefield Park. The mine entrance is open for inspection annually on the anniversary of the battle. There are sunken areas, where air shafts and cave-ins extend up to the &quot;T&quot; shape near the end. The park includes many other sites, primarily those that were a portion of the Union lines around Petersburg.


==In popular culture==
* The Battle of the Crater was graphically portrayed in the opening scenes of the 2003 film &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;, starring Jude Law as a Confederate soldier. The film inaccurately depicts the giant explosion occurring in broad daylight; it actually happened in darkness at 4:44 a.m.

<text>Semiotic literary criticism, also called literary semiotics, is the approach to literary criticism informed by the theory of signs or semiotics. Semiotics, tied closely to the structuralism pioneered by Ferdinand de Saussure, was extremely influential in the development of literary theory out of the formalist approaches of the early twentieth century.

==History==
The early forms of literary semiotics grew out of formalist approaches to literature, especially Russian formalism, and structuralist linguistics, especially the Prague school. Notable early semiotic authors included Vladimir Propp, Algirdas Julius Greimas, and Viktor Shklovsky. These critics were concerned with a formal analysis of narrative forms which would resemble a literary mathematics, or at least a literary syntax, as far as possible. They proposed various formal notations for narrative components and transformations and attempted a descriptive taxonomy of existing stories along these lines.

Propp&#x27;s &quot;Morphology of the Folktale&quot; (orig. Russian pub. 1928; English trans. 1958) provides an example of the formal and systematic approach. In successive chapters, Propp analyzes the characters, plot events, and other elements of traditional folktales (primarily from Russia and Eastern Europe). For each of these key components he provides a letter designation (with superscripts to designate specific subtypes). He proceeds to analyze individual tales by transposing them into this notation and then to generalize about their structure. For example:

: Analysis of a simple, single-move tale of class H-I, of the type: kidnapping of a person.
:: 131. A tsar, three daughters (α). The daughters go walking (β³), overstay in the garden (δ¹). A dragon kidnaps them (A¹). A call for aid (B¹). Quest of three heroes (C↑). Three battles with the dragon (H¹–I¹), rescue of the maidens (K4). Return (↓), reward (w°). (Propp 128)

Later semiotic approaches to literature have often been less systematic (or, in some special cases such as Roland Barthes&#x27;s &quot;S/Z&quot;, they have been so specifically and exhaustively systematic as to render the possibility of a complete literary semiotics doubtful). As structuralist linguistics gave way to a post-structuralist philosophy of language which denied the scientific ambitions of the general theory of signs, semiotic literary criticism became more playful and less systematic in its ambitions. Still, some authors harbor more scientific ambition for their literary schemata than others. Later authors in the semiotic tradition of literary criticism include Tzvetan Todorov, Mikhail Bakhtin, Roland Barthes, Juri Lotman, Julia Kristeva, Michael Riffaterre, and Umberto Eco.

<text>Psychoanalytic literary criticism is literary criticism or literary theory that, in method, concept, or form, is influenced by the tradition of psychoanalysis begun by Sigmund Freud.

Psychoanalytic reading has been practiced since the early development of psychoanalysis itself, and has developed into a heterogeneous interpretive tradition. As Celine Surprenant writes, &quot;Psychoanalytic literary criticism does not constitute a unified field. However, all variants endorse, at least to a certain degree, the idea that literature ... is fundamentally entwined with the psyche.&quot;

Psychoanalytic criticism views artists, including authors, as neurotic. However, an artist escapes many of the outward manifestations and end results of neurosis by finding in the act of creating his or her art a pathway back to sanity and wholeness.

==Overview==
The object of psychoanalytic literary criticism, at its very simplest, can be the psychoanalysis of the author or of a particularly interesting character in a given work. The criticism is similar to psychoanalysis itself, closely following the analytic interpretive process discussed in Freud&#x27;s &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot; and other works. Critics may view the fictional characters as psychological case studies, attempting to identify such Freudian concepts as the Oedipus complex, Freudian slips, Id, ego and superego, and so on, and demonstrate how they influence the thoughts and behaviors of fictional characters.

However, more complex variations of psychoanalytic criticism are possible. The concepts of psychoanalysis can be deployed with reference to the narrative or poetic structure itself, without requiring access to the authorial psyche (an interpretation motivated by French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan&#x27;s remark that &quot;the unconscious is structured like a language&quot;). Or the founding texts of psychoanalysis may themselves be treated as literature and reread for the light cast by their formal qualities on their theoretical content (Freud&#x27;s texts frequently resemble detective stories, or the archaeological narratives of which he was so fond).

Like all forms of literary criticism, psychoanalytic criticism can yield useful clues to the sometime baffling symbols, actions, and settings in a literary work; however, like all forms of literary criticism, it has its limits. For one thing, some critics rely on psychocriticism as a &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach, when other literary scholars argue that no one approach can adequately illuminate or interpret a complex work of art. As Guerin, et al. put it in &quot;A Handbook of Critical Approaches to Literature&quot;,

The danger is that the serious student may become theory-ridden, forgetting that Freud&#x27;s is not the only approach to literary criticism. To see a great work of fiction or a great poem primarily as a psychological case study is often to miss its wider significance and perhaps even the essential aesthetic experience it should provide.
==Methods==
===Early applications===
Freud wrote several important essays on literature, which he used to explore the psyche of authors and characters, to explain narrative mysteries, and to develop new concepts in psychoanalysis (for instance, &quot;Delusion and Dream in Jensen&#x27;s Gradiva&quot; and his influential readings of the Oedipus myth and Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; in &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot;). The criticism has been made, however, that in his and his early followers&#x27; studies &#x27;what calls for elucidation are not the artistic and literary works themselves, but rather the psychopathology and biography of the artist, writer, or fictional characters&#x27;. Thus &#x27;many psychoanalysts among Freud&#x27;s earliest adherents did not resist the temptation to psychoanalyze poets and painters (sometimes to Freud&#x27;s chagrin&#x27;). Later analysts would conclude that &#x27;clearly one cannot psychoanalyse a writer from his text; one can only appropriate him&#x27;.

Early psychoanalytic literary criticism would often treat the text as if it were a kind of dream. This means that the text represses its real (or latent) content behind obvious (manifest) content. The process of changing from latent to manifest content is known as the dream work and involves operations of concentration and displacement. The critic analyzes the language and symbolism of a text to reverse the process of the dream work and arrive at the underlying latent thoughts. The danger is that &#x27;such criticism tends to be reductive, explaining away the ambiguities of works of literature by reference to established psychoanalytic doctrine; and very little of this work retains much influence today&#x27;.

===Jungians===
Later readers, such as Carl Jung and another of Freud&#x27;s disciples, Karen Horney, broke with Freud, and their work, especially Jung&#x27;s, led to other rich branches of psychoanalytic criticism: Horney&#x27;s to feminist approaches including womb envy, and Jung&#x27;s to the study of archetypes and the collective unconscious. Jung&#x27;s work in particular was influential as, combined with the work of anthropologists such as Claude Lévi-Strauss and Joseph Campbell, it led to the entire fields of mythocriticism and archetype analysis.

Northrop Frye considered that &#x27;the literary critic finds Freud most suggestive for the theory of comedy, and Jung for the theory of romance&#x27;.

===Form===
Waugh writes, &#x27;The development of psychoanalytic approaches to literature proceeds from the shift of emphasis from &quot;content&quot; to the fabric of artistic and literary works&#x27;. Thus for example Hayden White has explored how &#x27;Freud&#x27;s descriptions tally with nineteenth-century theories of tropes, which his work somehow reinvents&#x27;.

Especially influential here has been the work of Jacques Lacan, an avid reader of literature who used literary examples as illustrations of important concepts in his work (for instance, Lacan argued with Jacques Derrida over the interpretation of Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Purloined Letter&quot;).

&#x27;Lacan&#x27;s theories have encouraged a criticism which focuses not on the author but on the linguistic processes of the text&#x27;. Within this Lacanian emphasis, &#x27;Freud&#x27;s theories become a place from which to raise questions of interpretation, rhetoric, style, and figuration&#x27;.

However, Lacanian scholars have noted that Lacan himself was not interested in literary criticism &quot;per se&quot;, but in how literature might illustrate a psychoanalytic method or concept.

===Reader response===
According to Ousby, &#x27;Among modern critical uses of psychoanalysis is the development of &quot;ego psychology&quot; in the work of Norman Holland, who concentrates on the relations between reader and text&#x27; – as with reader response criticism. Rollin writes that &#x27;Holland&#x27;s experiments in reader response theory suggest that we all read literature selectively, unconsciously projecting our own fantasies into it&#x27;.

Thus in crime fiction, for example, &#x27;Rycroft sees the criminal as personifying the reader&#x27;s unavowed hostility to the parent&#x27;.

===Charles Mauron: psychocriticism===
In 1963, Charles Mauron conceived a structured method to interpret literary works via psychoanalysis. The study implied four different phases:
# The creative process is akin to dreaming awake: as such, it is a mimetic, and cathartic, representation of an innate desire that is best expressed and revealed by metaphors and symbolically.
# Then, the juxtaposition of a writer&#x27;s works leads the critic to define symbolical themes.
# These metaphorical networks are significant of a latent inner reality.
# They point at an obsession just as dreams can do. The last phase consists in linking the writer&#x27;s literary creation to his own personal life.

On Mauron&#x27;s concept, the author cannot be reduced to a ratiocinating self: his own more or less traumatic biographical past, the cultural archetypes that have suffused his soul contrast with the conscious self, The chiasmic relation between the two tales may be seen as a sane and safe acting out. A basically unconscious sexual impulse is symbolically fulfilled in a positive and socially gratifying way, a process known as Sublimation.

===Anxiety of influence===
&#x27;The American critic Harold Bloom has adopted the Freudian notion of the Oedipus Complex to his study of relationships of influence between poets...and his work has also inspired a feminist variant in the work of Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar&#x27;.

In similar vein, Shoshana Felman has asked with respect to what she calls &quot;the guilt of poetry&quot; the question: &#x27;Could literary history be in any way considered as a repetitive unconscious &quot;transference&quot; of the guilt of poetry?&#x27;.

==Cultural examples==
In &quot;Small World: An Academic Romance&quot;, one of David Lodge&#x27;s satires of academia, the naive hero Persse follows Angelica to a forum where she discourses on Romance: &#x27;&quot;Roland Barthes has taught us the close connection between narrative and sexuality, between the pleasures of the body and the &#x27;pleasure of the text&#x27;...Romance is a multiple orgasm.&quot; Persse listened to this stream of filth flowing from between Angelica&#x27;s exquisite lips and pearly teeth with growing astonishment and burning cheeks, but no one else in the audience seemed to find anything remarkable or disturbing about her presentation&#x27;.

In A.S. Byatt&#x27;s novel &quot;Possession&quot;, the heroine/feminist scholar, while recognising that &#x27;&quot;we live in the truth of what Freud discovered&quot;&#x27;, concedes that &#x27;&quot;the whole of our scholarship – the whole of our thought – we question everything except the centrality of sexuality&quot;&#x27;.

<doc id="51054" wikidata="Q122783" url="?curid=51054" title="American black bear">
<text>The American black bear (Ursus americanus), or simply black bear, is a species of medium-sized bear endemic to North America. It is the continent&#x27;s smallest and most widely distributed bear species. It is an omnivore, with a diet varying greatly depending on season and location. It typically lives in largely forested areas but will leave forests in search of food and is sometimes attracted to human communities due to the immediate availability of food.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the American black bear as a least-concern species because of its widespread distribution and a large population, estimated to be twice that of all other bear species combined. Along with the brown bear (&quot;Ursus arctos&quot;), it is one of only two modern bear species not considered by the IUCN to be globally threatened with extinction.

== Taxonomy and evolution ==
The American black bear is not closely related to the brown bear or polar bear, though all three species are found in North America; genetic studies reveal that they split from a common ancestor 5.05 million years ago (mya). American and Asian black bears are considered sister taxa and are more closely related to each other than to the other modern species of bears. According to recent studies, the sun bear is also a relatively recent split from this lineage.

A small primitive bear called &quot;Ursus abstrusus&quot; is the oldest known North American fossil member of the genus &quot;Ursus&quot;, dated to 4.95 mya. This suggests that &quot;U. abstrusus&quot; may be the direct ancestor of the American black bear, which evolved in North America. Although Wolverton and Lyman still consider &quot;U. vitabilis&quot; an &quot;apparent precursor to modern black bears&quot;, it has also been placed within &quot;U. americanus&quot;.

The ancestors of American black bears and Asian black bears diverged from sun bears 4.58 mya. The American black bear then split from the Asian black bear 4.08 mya. The earliest American black bear fossils, which were located in Port Kennedy, Pennsylvania, greatly resemble the Asian species, though later specimens grew to sizes comparable to grizzly bears. From the Holocene to the present, American black bears seem to have shrunk in size, but this has been disputed because of problems with dating these fossil specimens.

The American black bear lived during the same period as the giant and lesser short-faced bears (&quot;Arctodus simus&quot; and &quot;A. pristinus&quot;, respectively) and the Florida spectacled bear (&quot;Tremarctos floridanus&quot;). These tremarctine bears evolved from bears that had emigrated from Asia to the Americas 7–8 mya. The giant and lesser short-faced bears are thought to have been heavily carnivorous and the Florida spectacled bear more herbivorous, while the American black bears remained arboreal omnivores, like their Asian ancestors.

The American black bear&#x27;s generalist behavior allowed it to exploit a wider variety of foods and has been given as a reason why, of these three genera, it alone survived climate and vegetative changes through the last Ice Age while the other, more specialized North American predators became extinct. However, both &quot;Arctodus&quot; and &quot;Tremarctos&quot; had survived several other, previous ice ages. After these prehistoric ursids became extinct during the last glacial period 10,000 years ago, American black bears were probably the only bear present in much of North America until the migration of brown bears to the rest of the continent.

=== Hybrids ===
American black bears are reproductively compatible with several other bear species and occasionally produce hybrid offspring. According to Jack Hanna&#x27;s &quot;Monkeys on the Interstate&quot;, a bear captured in Sanford, Florida, was thought to have been the offspring of an escaped female Asian black bear and a male American black bear. In 1859, an American black bear and a Eurasian brown bear were bred together in the London Zoological Gardens, but the three cubs that were born died before they reached maturity. In &quot;The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication&quot;, Charles Darwin noted:
A bear shot in autumn 1986 in Michigan was thought by some to be an American black bear/grizzly bear hybrid, because of its unusually large size and its proportionately larger brain case and skull. DNA testing was unable to determine whether it was a large American black bear or a grizzly bear.

=== Subspecies ===
Sixteen subspecies are traditionally recognized; however, a recent genetic study does not support designating some of these, such as the Florida black bear, as distinct subspecies. Listed alphabetically according to subspecific name:

== Distribution and population ==
Historically, American black bears occupied the majority of North America&#x27;s forested regions. Today, they are primarily limited to sparsely settled, forested areas. American black bears currently inhabit much of their original Canadian range, though they seldom occur in the southern farmlands of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba; they have been extirpated on Prince Edward Island since 1937. Surveys taken in the mid-1990s found the Canadian black bear population to be between 396,000 and 476,000 in seven provinces; this estimate excludes populations in New Brunswick, the Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan. All provinces indicated stable populations of American black bears over the last decade.

The current range in the United States is constant throughout most of the Northeast and within the Appalachian Mountains almost continuously from Maine to northern Georgia, the northern Midwest, the Rocky Mountain region, the West Coast and Alaska. However, it becomes increasingly fragmented or absent in other regions. Despite this, American black bears in those areas seem to have expanded their range in recent decades, such as with recent sightings in Ohio, Illinois, southern Indiana, and western Nebraska. Sightings of itinerant black bears in the Driftless Area of southeastern Minnesota, northeastern Iowa, and southwestern Wisconsin are common. In 2019, biologists with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources confirmed documentation of an American black bear living year-round in woodlands near the town of Decorah in northeastern Iowa, believed to be the first instance of a resident black bear in Iowa since the 1880s.

Surveys taken from 35 states in the early 1990s indicated that American black bear populations were either stable or increasing, except in Idaho and New Mexico. The population in the United States was estimated to range between 339,000 and 465,000 in 2011, though this estimate does not include data from Alaska, Idaho, South Dakota, Texas or Wyoming, whose populations were not recorded in the survey. In California there were an estimated 25,000-35,000 black bears in 2017, making it the largest population of the species in any of the 48 contiguous United States. In 2020 there were about 1,500 bears in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, where the population density is about two per square mile. In western North Carolina, the black bear population has dramatically increased in recent decades, from about 3,000 in the early 2000s to over 8,000 in the 2020s.

As of 1993, known black bear populations in Mexico existed in four areas, though knowledge on the distribution of populations outside those areas has not been updated since 1959. Mexico is the only country where the species is classified as &quot;endangered&quot;.

== Habitat ==
Throughout their range, habitats preferred by American black bears have a few shared characteristics. They are often found in areas with relatively inaccessible terrain, thick understory vegetation and large quantities of edible material (especially masts). The adaptation to woodlands and thick vegetation in this species may have originally been because the bear evolved alongside larger, more aggressive bear species, such as the extinct giant short-faced bear and the grizzly bear, that monopolized more open habitats and the historic presence of larger predators, such as &quot;Smilodon&quot; and the American lion, that could have preyed on black bears. Although found in the largest numbers in wild, undisturbed areas and rural regions, American black bears can adapt to surviving in some numbers in peri-urban regions, as long as they contain easily accessible foods and some vegetative coverage.

In most of the contiguous United States, American black bears today are usually found in heavily vegetated mountainous areas, from in elevation. For American black bears living in the American Southwest and Mexico, habitat usually consists of stands of chaparral and pinyon juniper woods. In this region, bears occasionally move to more open areas to feed on prickly pear cactus. At least two distinct, prime habitat types are inhabited in the Southeastern United States. American black bears in the southern Appalachian Mountains survive in predominantly oak-hickory and mixed mesophytic forests. In the coastal areas of the southeast (such as Florida, the Carolinas and Louisiana), bears inhabit a mixture of flatwoods, bays and swampy hardwood sites.

In the northeastern part of the range (the United States and Canada), prime habitat consists of a forest canopy of hardwoods such as beech, maple, birch and coniferous species. Corn crops and oak-hickory mast are also common sources of food in some sections of the northeast; small, thick swampy areas provide excellent refuge cover largely in stands of white cedar. Along the Pacific coast, redwood, Sitka spruce and hemlocks predominate as overstory cover. Within these northern forest types are early successional areas important for American black bears, such as fields of brush, wet and dry meadows, high tidelands, riparian areas and a variety of mast-producing hardwood species. The spruce-fir forest dominates much of the range of the American black bear in the Rockies. Important non-forested areas here are wet meadows, riparian areas, avalanche chutes, roadsides, burns, sidehill parks and subalpine ridgetops.

In areas where human development is relatively low, such as stretches of Canada and Alaska, American black bears tend to be found more regularly in lowland regions. In parts of northeastern Canada, especially Labrador, American black bears have adapted exclusively to semi-open areas that are more typical habitat in North America for brown bears (likely due to the absence there of brown and polar bears, as well as other large carnivore species).

== Description ==
=== Build ===

The skulls of American black bears are broad, with narrow muzzles and large jaw hinges. In Virginia, the length of adult bear skulls was found to average . Across its range, the greatest skull length for the species has been reportedly measured from . Females tend to have slenderer and more pointed faces than males.

Their claws are typically black or grayish-brown. The claws are short and rounded, being thick at the base and tapering to a point. Claws from both hind and front legs are almost identical in length, though the foreclaws tend to be more sharply curved. The paws of the species are relatively large, with a rear foot length of , which is proportionately larger than other medium-sized bear species, but much smaller than the paws of large adult brown, and especially polar bears. The soles of the feet are black or brownish and are naked, leathery and deeply wrinkled.

The hind legs are relatively longer than those of Asian black bears. The typically small tail is long. The ears are small and rounded and are set well back on the head.

American black bears are highly dexterous, being capable of opening screw-top jars and manipulating door latches. They also have great physical strength; a bear weighing was observed turning flat rocks weighing by flipping them over with a single foreleg. They move in a rhythmic, sure-footed way and can run at speeds of . American black bears have good eyesight and have been proven experimentally to be able to learn visual color discrimination tasks faster than chimpanzees and just as fast as domestic dogs. They are also capable of rapidly learning to distinguish different shapes such as small triangles, circles and squares.

=== Size ===
Adults typically range from in head-and-body length, and in shoulder height. Although they are the smallest bear species in North America, large males exceed the size of other bear species, except the brown bear and the polar bear.

Weight tends to vary according to age, sex, health and season. Seasonal variation in weight is very pronounced: in autumn, their pre-den weight tends to be 30% higher than in spring, when black bears emerge from their dens. Bears on the East Coast tend to be heavier on average than those on the West Coast, although they typically follow Bergmann&#x27;s rule, and bears from the northwest are often slightly heavier than the bears from the southeast. Adult males typically weigh between , while females weigh 33% less at .

In California, studies indicate that the average mass is in adult males and in adult females. Adults in Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge in east-central Alaska were found to average in males and in females, whereas on Kuiu Island in southeastern Alaska (where nutritious salmon are readily available) adults averaged . In Great Smoky Mountains National Park, adult males averaged and adult females averaged per one study.

In one of the largest studies on regional body mass, bears in British Columbia averaged in 89 females and in 243 males. In Yellowstone National Park, a study found that adult males averaged and adult females averaged . Black bears in north-central Minnesota averaged in 163 females and in 77 males. In New York, the males average and females . It was found in Nevada and the Lake Tahoe region that bears closer to urban regions were significantly heavier than their arid-country dwelling counterparts, with males near urban areas averaging against wild-land males which averaged whereas peri-urban females averaged against the average of in wild-land ones. In Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta, adults averaged .

The biggest wild American black bear ever recorded was a male from New Brunswick, shot in November 1972, that weighed after it had been dressed, meaning it weighed an estimated in life and measured long. Another notably outsized wild American black bear, weighing in at , was the cattle-killer shot in December 1921 on the Moqui Reservation in Arizona. The record-sized American black bear from New Jersey was shot in Morris County December 2011 and scaled . The Pennsylvania state record weighed and was shot in November 2010 in Pike County. The North American Bear Center, located in Ely, Minnesota, is home to the world&#x27;s largest captive male and female American black bears. Ted, the male, weighed in the fall of 2006. Honey, the female, weighed in the fall of 2007.

=== Pelage ===
The fur is soft, with dense underfur and long, coarse, thick guard hairs. The fur is not as shaggy or coarse as that of brown bears. American black bear skins can be distinguished from those of Asian black bears by the lack of a white blaze on the chest and hairier footpads.

Despite their name, black bears show a great deal of color variation. Individual coat colors can range from white, blonde, cinnamon, light brown or dark chocolate brown to jet black, with many intermediate variations existing. Silvery-gray American black bears with a blue luster (this is found mostly on the flanks) occur along a portion of coastal Alaska and British Columbia. White to cream-colored American black bears occur in the coastal islands and the adjacent mainland of southwestern British Columbia. Albino individuals have also been recorded. Black coats tend to predominate in humid areas, such as Maine, New England, New York, Tennessee, Michigan and western Washington. Approximately 70% of all American black bears are black, though only 50% in the Rocky Mountains are black. Many in northwestern North America are cinnamon, blonde or light brown in color and thus may sometimes be mistaken for grizzly bears. Grizzly (and other types of brown) bears can be distinguished by their shoulder hump, larger size and broader, more concave skull.

In his book &quot;The Great Bear Almanac&quot;, Gary Brown summarized the predominance of black or brown/blonde specimens by location:

== Behavior and life history ==

American black bears have eyesight and hearing comparable to that of humans. Their keenest sense is smell, which is about seven times more sensitive than a domestic dog&#x27;s. They are excellent and strong swimmers, swimming for pleasure and to feed (largely on fish). They regularly climb trees to feed, escape enemies and hibernate. Four of the eight modern bear species are habitually arboreal (the most arboreal species, the American and Asian black bears and the sun bear, being fairly closely related). Their arboreal abilities tend to decline with age. They may be active at any time of the day or night, although they mainly forage by night. Bears living near human habitations tend to be more extensively nocturnal, while those living near brown bears tend to be more often diurnal.

American black bears tend to be territorial and non-gregarious in nature. However, at abundant food sources (e.g. spawning salmon or garbage dumps), they may congregate and dominance hierarchies form, with the largest, most powerful males dominating the most fruitful feeding spots. They mark their territories by rubbing their bodies against trees and clawing at the bark. Annual ranges held by mature male bears tend to be very large, though there is some variation. On Long Island off the coast of Washington, ranges average , whereas on the Ungava Peninsula in Canada ranges can average up to , with some male bears traveling as far as at times of food shortages.

Bears may communicate with various vocal and non-vocal sounds. Tongue-clicking and grunting are the most common sounds and are made in cordial situations to conspecifics, offspring and occasionally humans. When at ease, they produce a loud rumbling hum. During times of fear or nervousness, bears may moan, huff or blow air. Warning sounds include jaw-clicking and lip-popping. In aggressive interactions, black bears produce guttural pulsing calls that may sound like growling. Cubs squeal, bawl or scream when anxious and make a motor-like humming sound when comfortable or nursing. American black bears often mark trees using their teeth and claws as a form of communication with other bears, a behavior common to many species of bears.

=== Reproduction and development ===
Sows usually produce their first litter at the age of 3 to 5 years, with those living in more developed areas tending to get pregnant at younger ages. The breeding period usually occurs in the June–July period, though it can extend to August in the species&#x27; northern range. The breeding period lasts for two to three months. Both sexes are promiscuous. Males try to mate with several females, but large, dominant ones may violently claim a female if another mature male comes near. Copulation can last 20–30 minutes. Sows tend to be short-tempered with their mates after copulating.

The fertilized eggs undergo delayed development and do not implant in the female&#x27;s womb until November. The gestation period lasts 235 days, and litters are usually born in late January to early February. Litter size is between one and six cubs, typically two or three. At birth, cubs weigh and measure in length. They are born with fine, gray, down-like hair and their hind quarters are underdeveloped. They typically open their eyes after 28–40 days and begin walking after 5 weeks. Cubs are dependent on their mother&#x27;s milk for 30 weeks and will reach independence at 16–18 months. At 6 weeks, they attain , by 8 weeks they reach and by 6 months they weigh . They reach sexual maturity at 3 years and attain their full growth at 5 years.

=== Longevity and mortality ===
The average lifespan in the wild is 18 years, though it is quite possible for wild individuals to survive for more than 23 years. The record age of a wild individual was 39 years, while that in captivity was 44 years. The average annual survival rate is variable, ranging from 86% in Florida to 73% in Virginia and North Carolina. In Minnesota, 99% of wintering adult bears were able to survive the hibernation cycle in one study. Remarkably, a study of American black bears in Nevada found that the amount of annual mortality of a population of bears in wilderness areas was 0%, whereas in developed areas in the state this figure rose to 83%. Survival in subadults is generally less assured. In Alaska, only 14–17% of subadult males and 30–48% of subadult females were found in a study to survive to adulthood. Across the range, the estimated number of cubs who survive past their first year is 60%.

With the exception of the rare confrontation with an adult brown bear or a gray wolf pack, adult black bears are not usually subject to natural predation. However, as evidenced by scats with fur inside of them and the recently discovered carcass of an adult sow with puncture marks in the skull, black bears may occasionally fall prey to jaguars in the southern parts of their range. In such scenarios, the big cat would have the advantage if it ambushed the bear, killing it with a crushing bite to the back of the skull. Cubs tend to be more vulnerable to predation than adults, with known predators including bobcats, coyotes, cougars, gray wolves, brown bears and other bears of their own species. Many of these will stealthily snatch small cubs right from under the sleeping mother. There is record of a golden eagle snatching a yearling cub. Once out of hibernation, mother bears may be able to fight off most potential predators. Even cougars will be displaced by an angry mother bear if they are discovered stalking the cubs. Flooding of dens after birth may also occasionally kill newborn cubs. However, in current times, bear fatalities are mainly attributable to human activities. Seasonally, thousands of black bears are hunted legally across North America to control their numbers, while some are illegally poached or trapped unregulated. Auto collisions also may claim many black bears annually.

=== Hibernation ===
American black bears were once not considered true or &quot;deep&quot; hibernators, but because of discoveries about the metabolic changes that allow black bears to remain dormant for months without eating, drinking, urinating or defecating, most biologists have redefined mammalian hibernation as &quot;specialized, seasonal reduction in metabolism concurrent with scarce food and cold weather&quot;. American black bears are now considered highly efficient hibernators. The physiology of American black bears in the wild is closely related to that of bears in captivity. Understanding the physiology of bears in the wild is vital to the bear&#x27;s success in captivity.

The bears enter their dens in October and November, although in the southernmost areas of their range (i.e. Florida, Mexico, the southeastern United States), only pregnant females and mothers with yearling cubs will enter hibernation. Prior to that time, they can put on up to of body fat to get them through the several months during which they fast. Hibernation typically lasts 3–8 months, depending on regional climate.

Hibernating bears spend their time in hollowed-out dens in tree cavities, under logs or rocks, in banks, caves, or culverts, and in shallow depressions. Although naturally-made dens are occasionally used, most dens are dug out by the bear. During their time in hibernation, an American black bear&#x27;s heart rate drops from 40 to 50 beats per minute to 8 beats per minute, and the metabolic rate can drop to a quarter of the bear&#x27;s (nonhibernating) basal metabolic rate. These reductions in metabolic rate and heart rate do not appear to decrease the bear&#x27;s ability to heal injuries during hibernation. Their circadian rhythm stays intact during hibernation. This allows the bear to sense the changes in the day based on the ambient temperature caused by the sun&#x27;s position in the sky. It has also been shown that ambient light exposure and low disturbance levels (that is to say, wild bears in ambient light conditions) directly correlate with their activity levels. The bear keeping track of the changing days allows it to awaken from hibernation at the appropriate time of year to conserve as much energy as possible.

The hibernating bear does not display the same rate of muscle and bone atrophy relative to other nonhibernatory animals that are subject to long periods of inactivity due to ailment or old age. A hibernating bear only loses approximately half the muscular strength compared to that of a well-nourished, inactive human. The bear&#x27;s bone mass does not change in geometry or mineral composition during hibernation, which implies that the bear&#x27;s conservation of bone mass during hibernation is caused by a biological mechanism. During hibernation American black bears retain all excretory waste, leading to the development of a hardened mass of fecal material in the colon known as a fecal plug. Leptin is released into the bear&#x27;s systems to suppress appetite. The retention of waste during hibernation (specifically in minerals such as calcium) may play a role in the bear&#x27;s resistance to atrophy.
The body temperature does not drop significantly, like other mammalian hibernators (staying around ) and they remain somewhat alert and active. If the winter is mild enough, they may wake up and forage for food. Females also give birth in February and nurture their cubs until the snow melts. During winter, American black bears consume 25–40% of their body weight. The footpads peel off while they sleep, making room for new tissue.

Many of the physiological changes an American black bear exhibits during hibernation are retained slightly post-hibernation. Upon exiting hibernation, bears retain a reduced heart rate and basal metabolic rate. The metabolic rate of a hibernating bear will remain at a reduced level for up to 21 days after hibernation. After emerging from their winter dens in spring, they wander their home ranges for two weeks so that their metabolism accustoms itself to the activity. In mountainous areas, they seek southerly slopes at lower elevations for forage and move to northerly and easterly slopes at higher elevations as summer progresses.

The time that American black bears emerge from hibernation varies. Factors affecting this include temperature, flooding, and hunger. In southern areas, they may wake up in midwinter. Further north, they may not be seen until late March, April, or even early May. Altitude also has an effect. Bears at lower altitudes tend to emerge earlier. Mature males tend to come out earliest, followed by immature males and females, and lastly mothers with cubs. Mothers with yearling cubs are seen before those with newborns.

=== Dietary habits ===

Generally, American black bears are largely crepuscular in foraging activity, though they may actively feed at any time. Up to 85% of their diet consists of vegetation, though they tend to dig less than brown bears, eating far fewer roots, bulbs, corms and tubers than the latter species. When initially emerging from hibernation, they will seek to feed on carrion from winter-killed animals and newborn ungulates. As the spring temperature warms, American black bears seek new shoots of many plant species, especially new grasses, wetland plants and forbs. Young shoots and buds from trees and shrubs during the spring period are important to bears emerging from hibernation, as they assist in rebuilding muscle and strengthening the skeleton and are often the only digestible foods available at that time. During summer, the diet largely comprises fruits, especially berries and soft masts such as buds and drupes.

During the autumn hyperphagia, feeding becomes virtually the full-time task. Hard masts become the most important part of the diet in autumn and may even partially dictate the species&#x27; distribution. Favored masts such as hazelnuts, oak acorns and whitebark pine nuts may be consumed by the hundreds each day by a single bear during the fall. During the fall period, bears may also habitually raid the nut caches of tree squirrels. Also extremely important in fall are berries such as huckleberries and buffalo berries. Bears living in areas near human settlements or around a considerable influx of recreational human activity often come to rely on foods inadvertently provided by humans, especially during summertime. These include refuse, birdseed, agricultural products and honey from apiaries.

The majority of the diet consists of insects, such as bees, yellow jackets, ants, beetles and their larvae. American black bears are also fond of honey and will gnaw through trees if hives are too deeply set into the trunks for them to reach it with their paws. Once the hive is breached, the bears will scrape the honeycombs together with their paws and eat them, regardless of stings from the bees. Bears that live in northern coastal regions (especially the Pacific Coast) will fish for salmon during the night, as their black fur is easily spotted by salmon in the daytime. Other bears, such as the white-furred Kermode bears of the islands of western Canada, have a 30% greater success rate in catching salmon than their black-furred counterparts. Other fish, including suckers, trout and catfish, are readily caught whenever possible. Although American black bears do not often engage in active predation of other large animals for much of the year, the species will regularly prey on mule and white-tailed deer fawns in spring, given the opportunity. Bears may catch the scent of hiding fawns when foraging for something else and then sniff them out and pounce on them. As the fawns reach 10 days of age, they can outmaneuver the bears, and their scent is soon ignored until the next year. American black bears have also been recorded similarly preying on elk calves in Idaho and moose calves in Alaska.

Predation on adult deer is rare, but it has been recorded. They may even hunt prey up to the size of adult female moose, which are considerably larger than themselves, by ambushing them. There is at least one record of a male American black bear killing two bull elk over the course of six days by chasing them into deep snow banks, which impeded their movements. In Labrador, American black bears are exceptionally carnivorous, living largely off caribou, usually young, injured, old, sickly or dead specimens, and rodents such as voles. This is believed to be due to a paucity of edible plant life in this sub-Arctic region and a local lack of competing large carnivores (including other bear species). Like brown bears, American black bears try to use surprise to ambush their prey and target the weak, injured, sickly or dying animals in the herds. Once a deer fawn is captured, it is frequently torn apart alive while feeding. If it is able to capture a mother deer in spring, the bear frequently begins feeding on the udder of lactating females, but generally prefers meat from the viscera. Bears often drag their prey to cover, preferring to feed in seclusion. The skin of large prey is stripped back and turned inside out, with the skeleton usually left largely intact. Unlike gray wolves and coyotes, bears rarely scatter the remains of their kills. Vegetation around the carcass is usually matted down, and their droppings are frequently found nearby. Bears may attempt to cover remains of larger carcasses, though they do not do so with the same frequency as cougars and grizzly bears. They will readily consume eggs and nestlings of various birds and can easily access many tree nests, even the huge nests of bald eagles. Bears have been reported stealing deer and other game from human hunters.

=== Interspecific predatory relationships ===
Over much of their range, American black bears are assured scavengers that can intimidate, using their large size and considerable strength, and if necessary dominate other predators in confrontations over carcasses. However, on occasions where they encounter Kodiak or grizzly bears, the larger two brown subspecies dominate them. American black bears tend to escape competition from brown bears by being more active in the daytime and living in more densely forested areas. Violent interactions, resulting in the deaths of American black bears, have been recorded in Yellowstone National Park.

American black bears do occasionally compete with cougars over carcasses. Like brown bears, they will sometimes steal kills from cougars. One study found that both bear species visited 24% of cougar kills in Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks, usurping 10% of the carcasses. Another study found that American black bears visited 48% of cougar kills in summer in Colorado and 77% of kills in California. As a result, the cats spend more time killing and less time feeding on each kill.

American black bear interactions with gray wolves are much rarer than with brown bears, due to differences in habitat preferences. The majority of American black bear encounters with wolves occur in the species&#x27; northern range, with no interactions being recorded in Mexico. Despite the American black bear being more powerful on a one-to-one basis, packs of wolves have been recorded to kill black bears on numerous occasions without eating them. Unlike brown bears, American black bears frequently lose against wolves in disputes over kills. Wolf packs typically kill American black bears when the larger animals are in their hibernation cycle.

There is at least one record of an American black bear killing a wolverine (&quot;Gulo gulo&quot;) in a dispute over food in Yellowstone National Park. Anecdotal cases of alligator predation on American black bears have been reported, though such cases may involve assaults on cubs. At least one jaguar (&quot;Panthera onca&quot;) has been recorded to have attacked and eaten a black bear: &quot;El Jefe&quot;, the jaguar famous for being the first jaguar seen in the United States in over a century.

== Relationships with humans ==

=== In folklore, mythology and culture ===

==== Indigenous ====
Black bears feature prominently in the stories of some of North America&#x27;s indigenous peoples. One tale tells of how the black bear was a creation of the Great Spirit, while the grizzly bear was created by the Evil Spirit. In the mythology of the Haida, Tlingit and Tsimshian people of the northwest coast, mankind first learned to respect bears when a girl married the son of a black bear chieftain. In Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw mythology, black and brown bears became enemies when Grizzly Bear Woman killed Black Bear Woman for being lazy. Black Bear Woman&#x27;s children, in turn, killed Grizzly Bear Woman&#x27;s children. The Navajo believed that the Big Black Bear was chief among the bears of the four directions surrounding Sun&#x27;s house and would pray to it in order to be granted its protection during raids.

Sleeping Bear Dunes in Michigan is named after a Native American legend, where a female bear and her two cubs swam across Lake Michigan to escape a fire on the Wisconsin shore. The mother bear reached the shore and waited for her cubs, but they did not make it across. Two islands mark where the cubs drowned, while the dune marks the spot where the mother bear waited.

==== Anglo-American ====
Morris Michtom, the creator of the teddy bear, was inspired to make the toy when he came across a cartoon of Theodore Roosevelt refusing to shoot a black bear cub tied to a tree. The fictional character Winnie-the-Pooh was named after Winnipeg, a female cub that lived at the London Zoo from 1915 until her death in 1934. A cub, who in the spring of 1950 was caught in the Capitan Gap Fire, was made into the living representative of Smokey Bear, the mascot of the United States Forest Service.

Terrible Ted was a de-toothed and de-clawed bear who was forced to perform as a pro wrestler and whose &quot;career&quot; lasted from the 1950s to the 1970s. The American black bear is the mascot of the University of Maine and Baylor University, where the university houses two live bears on campus.

=== Attacks on humans ===

Although an adult bear is quite capable of killing a human, American black bears typically avoid confronting humans. Unlike grizzly bears, which became a subject of fearsome legend among the European settlers of North America, black bears were rarely considered overly dangerous, even though they lived in areas where the pioneers had settled.

American black bears rarely attack when confronted by humans and usually only make mock charges, emit blowing noises and swat the ground with their forepaws. The number of attacks on humans is higher than those by brown bears in North America, but this is largely because black bears considerably outnumber brown bears. Compared to brown bear attacks, aggressive encounters with black bears rarely lead to serious injury. Most attacks tend to be motivated by hunger rather than territoriality and thus victims have a higher probability of surviving by fighting back rather than submitting. Unlike female brown bears, female American black bears are not as protective of their cubs and rarely attack humans in the vicinity of the cubs. However, occasionally such attacks do occur. The worst recorded attack occurred in May 1978, in which a bear killed three teenagers fishing in Algonquin Park in Ontario. Another exceptional attack occurred in August 1997 in Liard River Hot Springs Provincial Park in British Columbia, when an emaciated bear attacked a mother and child, killing the mother and a man who intervened. The bear was shot while mauling a fourth victim.

The majority of attacks happened in national parks, usually near campgrounds, where the bears had habituated to close human proximity and food. Of 1,028 incidents of aggressive acts toward humans, recorded from 1964 to 1976 in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, 107 resulted in injury and occurred mainly in tourist hot spots where people regularly fed the bears handouts. In almost every case where open garbage dumps that attracted bears were closed and handouts ceased, the number of aggressive encounters dropped. However, in the Liard River Hot Springs case, the bear was apparently dependent on a local garbage dump that had closed and so was starving to death. Attempts to relocate bears are typically unsuccessful, as the bears seem able to return to their home range, even without familiar landscape cues.

=== Livestock and crop predation ===
A limitation of food sources in early spring and wild berry and nut crop failures in summer may contribute to bears regularly feeding from human-based food sources. These bears often eat crops, especially during autumn hyperphagia when natural foods are scarce. Favored crops include apples, oats and corn. American black bears can do extensive damage in areas of the northwestern United States by stripping the bark from trees and feeding on the cambium. Livestock depredations occur mostly in spring.

Although they occasionally hunt adult cattle and horses, they seem to prefer smaller prey such as sheep, goats, pigs and young calves. They usually kill by biting the neck and shoulders, though they may break the neck or back of the prey with blows with the paws. Evidence of a bear attack includes claw marks and is often found on the neck, back and shoulders of larger animals. Surplus killing of sheep and goats is common. American black bears have been known to frighten livestock herds over cliffs, causing injuries and death to many animals; whether this is intentional is not known. Occasionally bears kill pets, especially domestic dogs, which are most prone to harass a bear. It is not recommended to use unleashed dogs to deter bear attacks. Although large, aggressive dogs can sometimes cause a bear to run, if pressed, angry bears often turn the tables and end up chasing the dogs in return. A bear in pursuit of a pet dog can threaten both canid and human lives.

=== Hunting ===
The hunting of American black bears has taken place since the initial settlement of the Americas. The first piece of evidence dates to a Clovis site at Lehner Ranch, Arizona. Partially calcined teeth of a 3-month old black bear cub came from a roasting pit, suggesting the bear cub was eaten. The surrounding charcoal was dated to the Early Holocene (10,940 BP). Black bear remains also appear to be associated with early peoples in Tlapacoya, Mexico. Native Americans increasingly utilized black bears during the Holocene, particularly in the late Holocene upper Midwest, e.g., Hopewell and Mississippian cultures.

Some Native American tribes, in admiration for the American black bear&#x27;s intelligence, would decorate the heads of bears they killed with trinkets and place them on blankets. Tobacco smoke would be wafted into the disembodied head&#x27;s nostrils by the hunter that dealt the killing blow, who would compliment the animal for its courage. The Kutchin typically hunted American black bears during their hibernation cycle. Unlike the hunting of hibernating grizzly bears, which was fraught with danger, hibernating American black bears took longer to awaken and hunting them was thus safer and easier. During the European colonisation of eastern North America, thousands of bears were hunted for their meat, fat and fur. Theodore Roosevelt wrote extensively on black bear hunting in his &quot;Hunting the Grisly and other sketches&quot;, in which he stated,

He wrote that black bears were difficult to hunt by stalking, due to their habitat preferences, though they were easy to trap. Roosevelt described how, in the southern states, planters regularly hunted bears on horseback with hounds. General Wade Hampton was known to have been present at 500 successful bear hunts, two-thirds of which he killed personally. He killed 30 or 40 bears with only a knife, which he would use to stab the bears between the shoulder blades while they were distracted by his hounds. Unless well trained, horses were often useless in bear hunts, as they often bolted when the bears stood their ground. In 1799, 192,000 American black bear skins were exported from Quebec. In 1822, 3,000 skins were exported from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. In 1992, untanned, fleshed and salted hides were sold for an average of $165.

In Canada, black bears are considered as both a big game and furbearer species in all provinces, save for New Brunswick and the Northwest Territories, where they are only classed as a big game species. There are around 80,900 licensed bear hunters in Canada. Canadian black bear hunts take place in the fall and spring, and both male and female bears can be legally taken, though some provinces prohibit the hunting of females with cubs, or yearlings.

Currently, 28 of the U.S. states have American black bear hunting seasons. Nineteen states require a bear hunting license, with some also requiring a big game license. In eight states, only a big game license is required. Overall, over 481,500 American black bear hunting licenses are sold per year. The hunting methods and seasons vary greatly according to state, with some bear hunting seasons including fall only, spring and fall, or year-round. New Jersey, in November 2010, approved a six-day bear-hunting season in early December 2010 to slow the growth of the population. Bear hunting had been banned in New Jersey for five years before that time. A Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind poll found that 53% of New Jersey voters approved of the new season if scientists concluded that bears were leaving their usual habitats and destroying private property. Men, older voters and those living in rural areas were more likely to approve of a bear hunting season in New Jersey than women, younger voters and those living in more developed parts of the state. In the western states, where there are large American black bear populations, there are spring and year-round seasons. Approximately 18,000 American black bears were killed annually in the U.S. between 1988 and 1992. Within this period, annual kills ranged from six bears in South Carolina to 2,232 in Maine. According to Dwight Schuh in his &quot;Bowhunter&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot;, American black bears are the third most popular quarry of bowhunters, behind deer and elk.

==== Meat ====

Bear meat had historically been held in high esteem among North America&#x27;s indigenous people and colonists. American black bears were the only bear species the Kutchin hunted for their meat, though this constituted only a small part of their diet. According to the second volume of &quot;Frank Forester&#x27;s Field Sports of the United States, and British Provinces, of North America&quot;:

Theodore Roosevelt likened the flesh of young American black bears to that of pork, and not as coarse or flavorless as the meat of grizzly bears. The most favored cuts of are concentrated in the legs and loins. Meat from the neck, front legs and shoulders is usually ground into minced meat or used for stews and casseroles. Keeping the fat on tends to give the meat a strong flavor. As American black bears can have trichinellosis, cooking temperatures need to be high in order to kill the parasites.

Bear fat was once valued as a cosmetic article that promoted hair growth and gloss. The fat most favored for this purpose was the hard white fat found in the body&#x27;s interior. As only a small portion of this fat could be harvested for this purpose, the oil was often mixed with large quantities of hog lard. However, animal rights activism over the last decade has slowed the harvest of these animals; therefore the lard from bears has not been used in recent years for the purpose of cosmetics.

<doc id="51056" wikidata="Q1383" url="?curid=51056" title="Lake Huron">
<text>Lake Huron ( ) is one of the five Great Lakes of North America. It is shared on the north and east by the Canadian province of Ontario and on the south and west by the U.S. state of Michigan. The name of the lake is derived from early French explorers who named it for the indigenous people they knew as Huron (Wyandot) inhabiting the region.
Hydrologically, Lake Huron comprises the eastern portion of Lake Michigan–Huron, having the same surface elevation as Lake Michigan, to which it is connected by the , Straits of Mackinac. Combined, Lake Michigan–Huron is the largest freshwater lake by area in the world. The Huronian glaciation was named from evidence collected from the Lake Huron region. The northern parts of the lake include the North Channel and Georgian Bay. Saginaw Bay is located in the southwest corner of the lake. The main inlet is the St. Marys River from Lake Superior, and the main outlet is through the St. Clair River toward Lake Erie. Lake Huron has a fairly large drainage basin covering parts of Michigan and Ontario. Water flows through Lake Huron faster than the other Great Lakes with a retention time of only 22 years.

==Geography==
By surface area, Lake Huron is the second-largest of the Great Lakes, with a surface area of —of which lies in Michigan and lies in Ontario—making it the third-largest fresh water lake on Earth (or the fourth-largest lake, if the Caspian Sea is counted as a lake). By volume however, Lake Huron is only the third largest of the Great Lakes, being surpassed by Lake Michigan and Lake Superior. When measured at the low water datum, the lake contains a volume of and a shoreline length (including islands) of .

The surface of Lake Huron is above sea level. The lake&#x27;s average depth is 32 fathoms 3 feet (), while the maximum recorded (by sonar) depth is . It has a length of and a greatest breadth of . A large bay that protrudes northeast from Lake Huron into Ontario, Canada, is called Georgian Bay. A notable feature of the lake is Manitoulin Island, which separates the North Channel and Georgian Bay from Lake Huron&#x27;s main body of water. It is the world&#x27;s largest lake island. A smaller bay that protrudes southwest from Lake Huron into Michigan is called Saginaw Bay.

Cities with over 10,000 people on Lake Huron include Sarnia, the largest city on Lake Huron, and Saugeen Shores in Canada and Bay City, Port Huron, and Alpena in the United States. Major centres on Georgian Bay include Owen Sound, Wasaga Beach, Collingwood, Midland, Penetanguishene, Port Severn and Parry Sound.

===Water levels===

Historic high water
The lake fluctuates from month to month with the highest lake levels in October and November. The normal high-water mark is above datum (&quot;577.5 ft or 176.0 m&quot;). In the summer of 1986, Lakes Michigan and Huron reached their highest level at above datum. The high-water records were broken for several months in a row in 2020.

Historic low water
Lake levels tend to be the lowest in winter. The normal low-water mark is below datum (&quot;577.5 ft or 176.0 m&quot;). In the winter of 1964, Lakes Michigan and Huron reached their lowest level at below datum. As with the high-water records, monthly low-water records were set each month from February 1964 through January 1965. During this twelve-month period, water levels ranged from below Chart Datum. The all-time low-water mark was eclipsed in January 2013.

==Geology==

Lake Huron has the largest shore line length of any of the Great Lakes, counting its 30,000 islands. It is separated from Lake Michigan, which lies at the same level, by the , Straits of Mackinac, making them hydrologically the same body of water (sometimes called Lake Michigan-Huron and sometimes described as two &#x27;lobes of the same lake&#x27;). Aggregated, Lake Huron-Michigan, at , &quot;is technically the world&#x27;s largest freshwater lake&quot;. Lake Superior, at 21 feet higher elevation, drains into the St. Marys River which then flows into Lake Huron. The water then flows south to the St. Clair River, at Port Huron, Michigan and Sarnia, Ontario. The Great Lakes Waterway continues thence to Lake St. Clair; the Detroit River and Detroit, Michigan; into Lake Erie and thence – via Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River – to the Atlantic Ocean.

Like the other Great Lakes, it was formed by melting ice as the continental glaciers retreated toward the end of the last ice age. Before this, Lake Huron was a low-lying depression through which flowed the now-buried Laurentian and Huronian Rivers; the lake bed was criss-crossed by a large network of tributaries to these ancient waterways, with many of the old channels still evident on bathymetric maps.

The Alpena-Amberley Ridge is an ancient ridge beneath the surface of Lake Huron, running from Alpena, Michigan, southwest to Point Clark, Ontario.

==History==

About 9,000 years ago, when water levels in Lake Huron were approximately below today&#x27;s levels, the Alpena-Amberley Ridge was exposed. That land bridge was used as a migration route for large herds of caribou. Since 2008, archaeologists have discovered at least 60 stone constructions along the submerged ridge that are thought to have been used as hunting blinds by Paleo-Indians. That a trade network brought obsidian from Oregon almost ten thousand years ago to be used for toolmaking was confirmed by a 2013 underwater discovery along the ridge. 

On the eve of European contact, the extent of development among Eastern Woodlands Native American societies is indicated by the archaeological evidence of a town on or near Lake Huron that contained more than one hundred large structures housing a total population of between 4,000 and 6,000. The French, the first European visitors to the region, often referred to Lake Huron as La Mer Douce, &quot;the fresh-water sea&quot;. In 1656, a map by French cartographer Nicolas Sanson refers to the lake by the name , a Wyandot word that has been translated variously, as &quot;Freshwater Sea&quot;, &quot;Lake of the Hurons&quot;, or simply &quot;lake&quot;. Generally, the lake was labeled &quot;Lac des Hurons&quot; (Lake of the Huron) on most early European maps. 

By the 1860s, many European settlements on the shores of Lake Huron were becoming incorporated, including Sarnia, the largest city on Lake Huron. On October 26, 2010, the Karegnondi Water Authority was formed to build and manage a pipeline from the lake to Flint, Michigan.

==Shipwrecks==
More than a thousand wrecks have been recorded in Lake Huron. Of these, 185 are located in Saginaw Bay, and 116 are found in the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary and Underwater Preserve, which was established in 2000. Georgian Bay contains 212 sunken vessels.

Purportedly the first European vessel to sail the Great Lakes, &quot;Le Griffon&quot; also became the first ship lost on the Great Lakes. It was built in 1679 on the eastern shore of Lake Erie near Buffalo, New York. Robert Cavalier, Sieur de la Salle navigated across Lake Erie, up the Detroit River, Lake St. Clair and the St. Clair River out into Lake Huron. Passing the Straits of Mackinac, La Salle made landfall on Washington Island, off the tip of the Door Peninsula on the Wisconsin side of Lake Michigan. La Salle filled &quot;Le Griffon&quot; with pelts and in late November 1679 sent &quot;Le Griffon&quot; back to the site of modern-day Buffalo, never to be seen again. Two wrecks have been identified as &quot;Le Griffon&quot;, although neither has gained final verification as the actual wreck. Blown by a fierce storm after leaving, &quot;Le Griffon&quot; ran aground before the storm. The people of Manitoulin Island say that the wreck in Mississagi Strait at the western tip of the island is that of &quot;Le Griffon&quot;. Meanwhile, others near Tobermory, say that the wreck on Russell Island, farther east in Georgian Bay, is that of &quot;Le Griffon&quot;.

=== Storm of 1913 ===

On November 9, 1913, the Great Lakes Storm of 1913 in Lake Huron sank 10 ships, and more than 20 were driven ashore. The storm, which raged for 16 hours, killed 235 seamen.

&quot;Matoa—a&quot; propeller freighter measuring 2,311 gross register tons—had passed between Port Huron, Michigan, and Sarnia, Ontario, just after midnight. On November 9, just after six in the morning, &quot;Senator&quot; pushed upstream. Less than an hour later, &quot;Manola&quot;—a propeller freighter of 2,325 gross register tons also built in Cleveland in 1890—passed through. Captain Frederick W. Light of &quot;Manola&quot; reported that both the Canadian and the American weather stations had storm flag signals flying from their weather towers. Following behind at 7:00 a.m. that Sunday, &quot;Regina&quot; steamed out of Sarnia into the northwest gale. The warnings had been up for four hours. &quot;Manola&quot; passed &quot;Regina&quot; off Port Sanilac, up the lake. Captain Light determined that if it continued to deteriorate, he would seek shelter at Harbor Beach, Michigan, another up the lake. There, he could seek shelter behind the breakwater. Before he reached Harbor Beach, the winds turned to the northeast and the lake began to rise. It was noon when he reached Harbor Beach and ran for shelter. 

The waves were so violent that &quot;Manola&quot; touched bottom entering the harbor. With help from a tugboat, &quot;Manola&quot; tied up to the break wall with eight lines. It was about 3:00 p.m. when &quot;Manola&quot; was secured and the crew prepared to drop anchor. As they worked, the cables began to snap from wind pressure against the hull. To keep from being pushed aground, they kept their bow into the wind with the engines running half to full in turns, yet the ship still drifted before its movement was arrested. Waves breaking over the ship damaged several windows, and the crew reported seeing portions of the concrete break wall peeling off as the waves struck it. Meanwhile, fifty miles farther up the lake, &quot;Matoa&quot; and Captain Hugh McLeod had to ride out the storm without a safe harbor. &quot;Matoa&quot; was found stranded on the Port Austin reef when the winds subsided. 

It was noon on Monday before the winds let up and not until 11:00 p.m. that night before Captain Light determined it to be safe to continue his journey. Although &quot;Manola&quot; survived the storm, she was renamed &quot;Mapledawn&quot; in 1920, and on November 24, 1924, she became stranded on Christian Island in Georgian Bay. It was declared a total loss. Salvagers were able to recover approximately 75,000 bushels of barley.

==Ecology==

Lake Huron has a lake retention time of 22 years. Like all of the Great Lakes, the ecology of Lake Huron has undergone drastic changes in the last century. The lake originally supported a native deepwater fish community dominated by lake trout, which fed on several species of ciscos as well as sculpins and other native fishes. Several invasive species, including sea lamprey, alewife and rainbow smelt, became abundant in the lake by the 1930s. The major native top predator, lake trout, was virtually extirpated from the lake by 1950 through a combination of overfishing and the effects of sea lamprey. Several species of ciscos were also extirpated from the lake by the 1960s; the only remaining native ciscoes are bloater and Cisco (lake herring). Non-native Pacific salmon have been stocked in the lake since the 1960s, but are less abundant since a profound food web change that took place in 2003. Lake trout have also been stocked for decades in an attempt to rehabilitate the species and today are largely self sustaining, especially in the northern half of the lake.

Lake Huron has suffered recently by the introduction of a variety of new invasive species, including zebra and quagga mussels, the spiny water flea, and round gobies. The demersal fish community of the lake was in a state of collapse by 2006, and a number of drastic changes have been observed in the zooplankton community of the lake. Chinook salmon catches have also been greatly reduced in recent years, and lake whitefish have become less abundant and are in poor condition. These recent changes may be attributable to the new exotic species. Some native species, however were beneficiaries of these chances (principally a result of the almost complete disappearance of the invasive Alewife in the lake). These native species include Lake Trout and Walleye. The Walleye population in Saginaw Bay area of Lake Huron reached recovery targets in 2009.

<text>Feminist literary criticism is literary criticism informed by feminist theory, or more broadly, by the politics of feminism. It uses the principles and ideology of feminism to critique the language of literature. This school of thought seeks to analyze and describe the ways in which literature portrays the narrative of male domination by exploring the economic, social, political, and psychological forces embedded within literature. This way of thinking and criticizing works can be said to have changed the way literary texts are viewed and studied, as well as changing and expanding the canon of what is commonly taught. It is used a lot in Greek myths.

Traditionally, feminist literary criticism has sought to examine old texts within literary canon through a new lens. Specific goals of feminist criticism include both the development and discovery of female tradition of writing, and rediscovering of old texts, while also interpreting symbolism of women&#x27;s writing so that it will not be lost or ignored by the male point of view and resisting sexism inherent in the majority of mainstream literature. These goals, along with the intent to analyze women writers and their writings from a female perspective, and increase awareness of the sexual politics of language and style were developed by Lisa Tuttle in the 1980s, and have since been adopted by a majority of feminist critics.

The history of feminist literary criticism is extensive, from classic works of nineteenth-century female authors such as George Eliot and Margaret Fuller to cutting-edge theoretical work in women&#x27;s studies and gender studies by &quot;third-wave&quot; authors. Before the 1970s—in the first and second waves of feminism—feminist literary criticism was concerned with women&#x27;s authorship and the representation of women&#x27;s condition within the literature; in particular the depiction of fictional female characters. In addition, feminist literary criticism is concerned with the exclusion of women from the literary canon, with theorists such as Lois Tyson suggesting that this is because the views of women authors are often not considered to be universal.

Additionally, feminist criticism has been closely associated with the birth and growth of queer studies. Modern feminist literary theory seeks to understand both the literary portrayals and representation of both women and people in the queer community, expanding the role of a variety of identities and analysis within feminist literary criticism.

==Methods employed==
Feminist scholarship has developed a variety of ways to unpack literature in order to understand its essence through a feminist lens. Scholars under the camp known as Feminine Critique sought to divorce literary analysis away from abstract diction-based arguments and instead tailored their criticism to more &quot;grounded&quot; pieces of literature (plot, characters, etc.) and recognize the perceived implicit misogyny of the structure of the story itself. Others schools of thought such as gynocriticism—which is considered a &#x27;female&#x27; perspective on women&#x27;s writings—uses a historicist approach to literature by exposing exemplary female scholarship in literature and the ways in which their relation to gender structure relayed in their portrayal of both fiction and reality in their texts. Gynocriticism was introduced during the time of second wave feminism. Elaine Showalter suggests that feminist critique is an &quot;ideological, righteous, angry, and admonitory search for the sins and errors of the past,&quot; and says gynocriticism enlists &quot;the grace of imagination in a disinterested search for the essential difference of women&#x27;s writing.&quot;

More contemporary scholars attempt to understand the intersecting points of femininity and complicate our common assumptions about gender politics by accessing different categories of identity (race, class, sexual orientation, etc.) The ultimate goal of any of these tools is to uncover and expose patriarchal underlying tensions within novels and interrogate the ways in which our basic literary assumptions about such novels are contingent on female subordination. In this way, the accessibility of literature broadens to a far more inclusive and holistic population. Moreover, works that historically received little or no attention, given the historical constraints around female authorship in some cultures, are able to be heard in their original form and unabridged. This makes a broader collection of literature for all readers insofar as all great works of literature are given exposure without bias towards a gender influenced system.

Women have also begun to employ anti-patriarchal themes to protest the historical censorship of literature written by women. The rise of decadent feminist literature in the 1990s was meant to directly challenge the sexual politics of the patriarchy. By employing a wide range of female sexual exploration and lesbian and queer identities by those like Rita Felski and Judith Bennet, women were able attract more attention about feminist topics in literature.

Since the development of more complex conceptions of gender and subjectivity and third-wave feminism, feminist literary criticism has taken a variety of new routes, namely in the tradition of the Frankfurt School&#x27;s critical theory, which analyzes how the dominant ideology of a subject influences societal understanding. It has also considered gender in the terms of Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis, as part of the deconstruction of existing relations of power, and as a concrete political investment. The more traditionally central feminist concern with the representation and politics of women&#x27;s lives has continued to play an active role in criticism. More specifically, modern feminist criticism deals with those issues related to the perceived intentional and unintentional patriarchal programming within key aspects of society including education, politics and the work force.

When looking at literature, modern feminist literary critics also seek ask how feminist, literary, and critical the critique practices are, with scholars such as Susan Lanser looking to improve both literature analysis and the analyzer&#x27;s own practices to be more diverse.

==History and critics==
While the beginning of more mainstream feminist literary criticism is typically considered during second-wave feminism, there are multiple texts prior to that era that contributed greatly to the field. Feminist literary criticism can be traced back to medieval times, with some arguing that Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s Wife of Bath could be an example of early feminist literary critics. Additionally, the period considered First wave feminism also contributed extensively to literature and women&#x27;s presence within it. For example, 1929&#x27;s A Room of One&#x27;s Own by Virginia Woolf is undoubtedly considered one of these formative texts. In it, Woolf argues that in order to write creatively and be critically successful, a woman must be able to own her own space and financial stability. And though the basis of the plot is around a Woolf speaking at a conference for women&#x27;s literature, she speculates that there is still a long way to go for women and so-called &#x27;women&#x27;s issues&#x27; in creative space, especially based on the differences in educational quality Woolf observed between men and women.

Modern feminist literary criticism finds most of its roots in the 1960s second-wave feminist movements. Beginning with the interrogation of male-centric literature that portrayed women in a demeaning and oppressed model, theorists such as Mary Ellman, Kate Millet and Germaine Greer challenged past imaginations of the feminine within literary scholarship. Within second-wave feminism, three phases can be defined: the feminine phase, the feminist phase, and the female phase. During the feminine phase, female writers adhered to male values. In the feminist phase, there was a theme of criticism of women&#x27;s role in society. And in the female phase, it was now assumed that women&#x27;s works were valid, and the works were less combative than in the feminist phase.

Susan Lanser suggested changing the name of feminist literary criticism to &quot;critical literary feminism&quot; to change the focus from the criticism to the feminism, and points out that writing such works requires &quot;consciousness of political context.&quot; In a similar vein, Elaine Showalter became a leading critic in the gynocritical method with her work &quot;A Literature of their Own&quot; in 1977. By this time, scholars were not only interested in simply demarcating narratives of oppression but also creating a literary space for past, present and future female literary scholars to substantiate their experience in a genuine way that appreciates the aesthetic form of their works.

Additionally, Black literary feminist scholars began to emerge, in the post-Civil Rights era of the United States, as a response to the masculine-centric narratives of Black empowerments began to gain momentum over female voices. Although not a &quot;critical&quot; text, &quot;The Black Woman: An Anthology&quot;, edited by Cade (1970) is seen as essential to the rise of Black literary criticism and theory. Its compilation of poems, short stories and essays gave rise to new institutionally supported forms of Black literary scholarship. The Combahee River Collective released what is called one of the most famous pieces in Black literary scholarship known as &quot;A Black Feminist Statement&quot; (1977), which sought to prove that literary feminism was an important component to black female liberation.

In 1979 Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar published The Madwoman in the Attic, an analysis of women&#x27;s poetry and prose, and how it fits into the larger feminist literary canon. This publication has become a staple of feminist criticism and has expanded the realm of publications considered to be feminist works, especially in the 19th century. The book specifically argues that women have largely been considered in two distinct categories by men in academia, monsters or angels. Gilbert and Gubar argued that being trapped in these categories regulated women writers to specific areas of literature and writing, leaving the rest open only to men, and causing a distinct anxiety in women&#x27;s writers to stay specifically within those categories or be ridiculed. Gilbert and Gubar&#x27;s specific focus on literary criticism in the realm of poetry and other short pieces has expanded the possibilities of feminist literary contributions today, as they were previously seen as less valid than longer works. Today, writers like Gloria E. Anzaldúa have been able to contribute to the feminist canon, while still working with writing forms other than full-sized novels.

In the 1980s, Hazel Carby, Barbara Christian, bell hooks, Nellie McKay, Valerie Smith, Hortense Spillers, Eleanor Traylor, Cheryl Wall and Sheryl Ann Williams all contributed heavily to the Black Feminist Scholarship of the period. During that same time, Deborah E. McDowell published &quot;New Directions for Black Feminist Criticism&quot;, which called for a more theoretical school of criticism versus the current writings, which she deemed overly practical. In this essay McDowell also extensively discussed black women&#x27;s portrayal in literature, and how it came across as even more negative than white women&#x27;s portrayal. As time moved forward, the theory began to disperse in ideology. Many decided to shift towards the nuanced psychological factors of the Black experience and further away from broad sweeping generalizations. Others began to connect their works to the politics of lesbianism. Some decided to analyze the Black experience through their relationship to the Western world. Regardless, these scholars continue to employ a variety of methods to explore the identity of Black feminism in literature.

French scholars such as Julia Kristeva, Hélène Cixous, Luce Irigaray and Bracha L. Ettinger introduced psychoanalytic discourses into their work by way of Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan as a way to truly &quot;get to the root&quot; of feminine anxieties within text to manifest broader societal truths about the place of women. Current feminist scholars in the field of literature include Hortense Spillers, Nancy Armstrong, Annette Kolodny and Irene Tayler who all come from a variety of backgrounds who use their own nuanced and subjective experiences to inform their understanding of feminist literature. Currently, several university scholars all employ the usage of literary feminism when critiquing texts. The mainstreaming of this school has given academia an extremely useful tool in raising questions over the gender relationships within texts.

==Modern applications==

As with other aspects of feminist theory, over the course of the second half of twentieth century feminist literary criticism has expanded to include a significantly broader spectrum of identities under the umbrella term of &#x27;feminism&#x27;. Third wave feminist theory and beyond has striven to include more identities and aspects of intersectionality, and feminist literary criticism has followed suit. Third wave feminism and feminist literary criticism is concerned more with the intersection of race and other feminist concerns. As a result, the variety and nature of texts examined has grown to include more texts from transnational perspective, while still maintaining its roots in analyzing how male dominated society effects the interpretation and creation of literature. At the same time, new feminist literary critics examine the universal images used by women writers to uncover the unconscious symbolism women have used to describe themselves, their world, female society across time and nationalities to uncover the specifically feminine language in literature. New Feminist literature and criticism minimize the focus on male influences and disruptions in a woman&#x27;s text by socio-political hegemony to better uncover the universal unconscious of the female mind in its own context.
