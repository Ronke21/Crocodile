<text>The white bass, silver bass, or sand bass (Morone chrysops) is a freshwater fish of the temperate bass family Moronidae. commonly around 12–15 inches long. The species&#x27; main color is silver-white to pale green. Its back is dark, with white sides and belly, and with narrow dark stripes running lengthwise on its sides. It has large, rough scales and two dorsal fins. They are widely distributed across North America, inhabiting large reservoirs and rivers. When mating in the spring, they are more often found in shallow rivers, creeks, and streams. They have been introduced in some places as sport fish and also to predate on nuisance fish, such as gizzard shad. It is the state fish of Oklahoma.

== Range ==
White bass are distributed widely across the United States, especially in the Midwest. They are very abundant in Pennsylvania and the area around Lake Erie. Some native ranges of the white bass are the Arkansas River, western Lake Erie, the Detroit River, and Lake Poinsett in South Dakota; they are abundant in the Winnebago lakes system of Wisconsin; and they are also very abundant in Oklahoma. White bass have also been found in rivers that flow to the Mississippi. Native to many northern habitats, they have been introduced in many different waters around the United States, particularly in southern locations. They were also successfully introduced to Manitoba starting in the 1960s, where they have gained importance as a sport fish.

== Description ==

The species&#x27; main color is silver-white to pale green. Its back is dark, with white sides and belly, and with narrow dark stripes running lengthwise on its sides. It has large, rough scales and two dorsal fins. The more anterior dorsal fin is much harder and appears to have spines on it. Although these are not true spines, this type of fin is called a spinous ray. The more posterior of the two dorsal fins is much softer, and is thus called a soft-ray. White bass can be distinguished from white perch (&quot;Morone americana&quot;) by having separated anterior and posterior dorsal fins; the spinous-ray and soft-ray portions of the dorsal fin of white perch are united and both are erected together when the spinous portion is extended. Because the vertebrae do not extend into the tail, the white bass has what is called a homocercal tail. The body is deep and compressed laterally. Most grow to a length between , though they can reach or more. Because the dorsal and ventral portions of its tail angle inward toward a point to create a clear angle, the tail is said to be notched.

The record size for white bass caught on fishing tackle, per The International Game Fish Association, is shared by fish caught in 1989 in Orange Lake, Orange, Virginia, and in 2010 in Amite River, Louisiana.

==Diet==
White bass are carnivores. They have four main taxa in their diet: calanoid copepods, cyclopoid copepods, daphnia, and leptodora. They are visual feeders. When not frightened, they will bite readily at live bait such as worms and minnows. Only the largest fish will feed on other fish, and as the summer season progresses, there is an overall trend towards eating fewer fish. Fish that are able to accumulate lipids over the summer are better able to survive cold winters. When looking at midwestern white bass, particularly in South Dakota, diet overlap occurs between the bass and the walleye. As seasons progress through the summer and fall, the amount of diet overlap decreases as a result of both fish increasing in length.

==Habitat==
White bass are found in high densities in the upstream segment of rivers. This portion of the river becomes the most degraded, as a number of different kinds of fish live in this segment, as well.

==Reproduction==
The spawning season for the white bass is mid-March to late May. The optimal water temperatures are . They are known to find their home spawning ground even if it is moved to a different part of the same lake. They often spawn in moving water in a tributary stream, but they will spawn in windswept lake shores. They spawn during daylight. Females release 242,000 to 933,000 eggs which stick to the surface of objects. Eggs are laid in clear, relatively shallow water on plants, submerged logs, gravel, or rocks. The parents move to deeper water and do not care for the young fish. The young fish live in shallow water for a while until they move to deeper water.

When trying to find a female with whom to mate, males will bump against a female&#x27;s abdominal area. The female will then rise closer to the surface and begin spinning and releasing eggs. Several males that have stayed in the area will be able to fertilize the eggs the female releases.

===Hybrids with other bass===
White bass have also been hybridized with striped bass (&quot;Morone saxatilis&quot;) to produce hybrid striped bass also known as wiper, whiterock bass, sunshine bass, palmetto bass, and Cherokee bass. These hybrids have been stocked in many freshwater areas across the US. White bass have one tooth patch on the back of their tongue, unlike hybrid striped bass and striped bass, which both have two patches there.

<text>The white perch (Morone americana) is not a true perch but is a fish of the temperate bass family, Moronidae, notable as a food and game fish in eastern North America. In some places it is referred to as &quot;Silver Bass&quot;.

The common name &quot;white perch&quot; is sometimes applied to the white crappie (&quot;Pomoxis annularis&quot;).

== Description ==
Generally silvery-white in color, hence the name, depending upon habitat and size specimens have begun to develop a darker shade near the dorsal fin and along the top of the fish. This sometimes earns them the nickname &quot;black-back&quot;. White perch have been reported up to in length and weighing .

== Ecology ==
Although favoring brackish waters, it is also found in fresh water and coastal areas from the St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario south to the Pee Dee River in South Carolina, and as far east as Nova Scotia. They are also found in the lower Great Lakes, Finger Lakes, Long Island Sound and nearby coastal areas, Hudson and Mohawk River system, Delaware Bay and Chesapeake Bay. It is also found occasionally in small landlocked lakes and ponds.

==Diet==
White perch are known to eat the eggs of many species native to the Great Lakes, such as walleye and other true perches. At times, fish eggs are 100% of their diet. They prefer to eat small minnows like mudminnows and fathead minnows.

In the Chesapeake Bay, white perch commonly prey upon grass shrimp, razor clams, and bloodworms which are all common to the region. 

==Reproduction==
White perch are a prolific species. The female can deposit over 150,000 eggs in a spawning session, lasting just over a week. Several males will often attend a spawning female, and each may fertilize a portion of her eggs. The young hatch within one to six days of fertilization.

At times, a parasite known as &quot;Lironeca ovalis&quot; is located in the gills. Its presence is believed to reduce the growth rate of white perch.

The white perch is currently recovering from a loss of population in the Hudson River.

==Aquatic nuisance species==

Some states consider the white perch to be a nuisance species due to its ability to destroy fisheries. They have been associated with the declines in both walleye and white bass populations because they feed heavily on baitfish used by those species and outcompete them for food and space. Many states have enacted laws forbidding possession of live white perch. Additionally, these states recommend not releasing captured white perch back into the water to help control its spread.

<text>The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), Dow Jones, or simply the Dow (), is a stock market index of 30 prominent companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States.

The DJIA is one of the oldest and most commonly followed equity indexes. It is price-weighted, unlike other common indexes such as the Nasdaq Composite or S&amp;P 500, which use market capitalization. The DJIA also contains fewer stocks, which could exhibit higher risk; however, it could be less volatile when the market is rapidly rising or falling due to its components being well-established large-cap companies.

The value of the index can also be calculated as the sum of the stock prices of the companies included in the index, divided by a factor, which is approximately 0.163 . The factor is changed whenever a constituent company undergoes a stock split so that the value of the index is unaffected by the stock split.

First calculated on May 26, 1896, the index is the second-oldest among U.S. market indices, after the Dow Jones Transportation Average. It was created by Charles Dow, co-founder of both &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and Dow Jones &amp; Company, and named after him and his business associate, statistician Edward Jones.

The index is maintained by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, an entity majority-owned by S&amp;P Global. Its components are selected by a committee. The ten components with the largest dividend yields are commonly referred to as the Dogs of the Dow. As with all stock prices, the prices of the constituent stocks and consequently the value of the index itself are affected by the performance of the respective companies as well as macroeconomic factors.
==Components==
 the Dow Jones Industrial Average consists of the following companies, with a weighting as shown:

== Former components ==
As of November 8, 2024, the components of the DJIA have changed 59 times since its beginning on May 26, 1896. General Electric had the longest presence on the index, beginning in the original index in 1896 and ending in 2018, but was dropped and re-added twice between 1898 and 1907. Changes to the index since 1991 are as follows:
* On May 6, 1991, Caterpillar Inc., J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., and The Walt Disney Company replaced American Can, Navistar, and U.S. Steel.
* On March 17, 1997, Travelers Inc., Hewlett-Packard, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Walmart replaced Westinghouse Electric, Texaco, Bethlehem Steel, and F. W. Woolworth Company.
* On November 1, 1999, Microsoft, Intel, SBC Communications, and Home Depot replaced Goodyear Tire, Sears Roebuck, Union Carbide, and Chevron Corporation. Intel and Microsoft became the first and second companies traded on the Nasdaq to be part of the Dow.
* On April 8, 2004, American International Group, Pfizer, and Verizon Communications replaced AT&amp;T Corporation, Kodak, and International Paper.
* On February 19, 2008, Chevron Corporation and Bank of America replaced Altria Group and Honeywell. Chevron was previously a Dow component from July 18, 1930, to November 1, 1999. During Chevron&#x27;s absence, its split-adjusted price per share went from $44 to $85, while the price of petroleum rose from $24 to $100 per barrel.
* On September 22, 2008, Kraft Foods Inc. replaced American International Group (AIG) in the index.
* On June 8, 2009, The Travelers Companies and Cisco Systems replaced Motors Liquidation Company (formerly General Motors) and Citigroup. Cisco became the third company traded on the NASDAQ to be part of the Dow.
* On September 24, 2012, UnitedHealth Group replaced Kraft Foods Inc. following Kraft&#x27;s split into Mondelez International and Kraft Foods.
* On September 23, 2013, Goldman Sachs, Nike, Inc., and Visa Inc. replaced Alcoa, Bank of America, and Hewlett-Packard. Visa replaced Hewlett-Packard because of the split into HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.
* On March 19, 2015, Apple Inc. replaced AT&amp;T, which had been a component of the DJIA since November 1916. Apple became the fourth company traded on the NASDAQ to be part of the Dow.
* On September 1, 2017, DowDuPont replaced DuPont. DowDuPont was formed by the merger of Dow Chemical Company with DuPont.
* On June 26, 2018, Walgreens Boots Alliance replaced General Electric, which had been a component of the DJIA since November 1907, after being part of the inaugural index in May 1896 and much of the 1896 to 1907 period.
* On April 2, 2019, Dow Inc. replaced DowDuPont. Dow, Inc. is a spin-off of DowDuPont, itself a merger of Dow Chemical Company and DuPont.
* On April 6, 2020, Raytheon Technologies replaced United Technologies. Raytheon is the name of the combination of United Technologies and the Raytheon Company, which merged as of April 3, 2020. The newly combined conglomerate does not include previous subsidiaries Carrier Global or Otis Worldwide.
* On August 31, 2020, Amgen, Honeywell, and Salesforce.com replaced ExxonMobil, Pfizer, and Raytheon Technologies.
* On February 26, 2024, Amazon replaced Walgreens Boots Alliance.
* On November 8, 2024, Nvidia replaced Intel, and Sherwin-Williams replaced Dow Inc.

==Investment methods==
Investing in the DJIA is possible via index funds as well as via derivatives such as option contracts and futures contracts.

===Mutual and exchange-traded funds===
Index funds, including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETF) can replicate, before fees and expenses, the performance of the index by holding the same stocks as the index in the same proportions. An ETF that replicates the performance of the index is issued by State Street Corporation ().

ProShares offers leveraged ETFs that attempt to produce three times the daily result of either investing in () or shorting () the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

===Futures contracts===
In the derivatives market, the CME Group through its subsidiaries the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), issues Futures Contracts; the E-mini Dow ($5) Futures (YM), which track the average and trade on their exchange floors respectively. Trading is typically carried out in an open outcry auction, or over an electronic network such as CME&#x27;s Globex platform.

===Options contracts===
The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) issues option contracts on the Dow through the root symbol DJX. Options on various Dow-underlying ETFs are also available for trading.

== Annual returns ==
The following table shows the annual development of the Dow Jones Index, which was calculated back to 1896.

==History==
===Precursor===

In 1884, Charles Dow composed his first stock average, which contained nine railroads and two industrial companies that appeared in the &quot;Customer&#x27;s Afternoon Letter&quot;, a daily two-page financial news bulletin which was the precursor to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. On January 2, 1886, the number of stocks represented in what is now the &quot;Dow Jones Transportation Average&quot; dropped from 14 to 12, as the Central Pacific Railroad and Central Railroad of New Jersey were removed. Though comprising the same number of stocks, this index contained only one of the original twelve industrials that would eventually form Dow&#x27;s most famous index.

===Initial components===
Dow calculated his first average purely of industrial stocks on May 26, 1896, creating what is now known as the &quot;Dow Jones Industrial Average&quot;. None of the original 12 industrials still remain part of the index.
* American Cotton Oil Company, a predecessor company to Hellmann&#x27;s and Best Foods, now part of Unilever.
* American Sugar Refining Company, became Domino Sugar in 1900, now Domino Foods, Inc.
* American Tobacco Company, broken up in a 1911 antitrust action.
* Chicago Gas Company, bought by Peoples Gas Light in 1897, was an operating subsidiary of the now-defunct Integrys Energy Group until 2014.
* Distilling &amp; Cattle Feeding Company, now Millennium Chemicals, formerly a division of LyondellBasell.
* General Electric, still in operation, removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2018.
* Laclede Gas Company, still in operation as Spire Inc, removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1899.
* National Lead Company, now NL Industries, removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1916.
* North American Company, an electric utility holding company, broken up by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 1946.
* Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company in Birmingham, Alabama, bought by U.S. Steel in 1907; U.S. Steel was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1991.
* United States Leather Company, dissolved in 1952.
* United States Rubber Company, changed its name to Uniroyal in 1961, merged with private Goodrich Corporation in 1986, tire business bought by Michelin in 1990. The remainder of Goodrich remained independent until it was acquired by United Technologies in 2012 and became a part of UTC Aerospace Systems, now Collins Aerospace, a Raytheon Technologies subsidiary.

===Early years===
When it was first published in the mid-1880s, the index stood at a level of 62.76. It reached a peak of 78.38 during the summer of 1890, but reached its all-time low of 28.48 in the summer of 1896 during the Panic of 1896. Many of the biggest percentage price moves in the Dow occurred early in its history, as the nascent industrial economy matured. In the 1900s, the Dow halted its momentum as it worked its way through two financial crises: the Panic of 1901 and the Panic of 1907. The Dow remained stuck in a range between 53 and 103 until late 1914. The negativity surrounding the 1906 San Francisco earthquake did little to improve the economic climate; the index broke 100 for the first time in 1906.

At the start of the 1910s, the Panic of 1910–1911 stifled economic growth. On July 30, 1914, as the average stood at a level of 71.42, a decision was made to close the New York Stock Exchange, and suspend trading for a span of four and a half months. Some historians believe the exchange was closed because of a concern that markets would plunge as a result of panic over the onset of World War I. An alternative explanation is that the United States Secretary of the Treasury, William Gibbs McAdoo, closed the exchange to conserve the U.S. gold stock in order to launch the Federal Reserve System later that year, with enough gold to keep the United States on par with the gold standard. When the markets reopened on December 12, 1914, the index closed at 74.56, a gain of 4.4%. This is frequently reported as a large drop, due to using a later redefinition. Reports from the time say that the day was positive. Following World War I, the United States experienced another economic downturn, the Post–World War I recession. The Dow&#x27;s performance remained unchanged from the closing value of the previous decade, adding only 8.26%, from 99.05 at the beginning of 1910, to a level of 107.23 at the end of 1919.

The Dow experienced a long bull run from 1920 to late 1929 when it rose from 73 to 381 points. In 1928, the components of the Dow were increased to 30 stocks near the economic height of that decade, which was nicknamed the Roaring Twenties. This period downplayed the influence of the Depression of 1920–1921 and certain international conflicts such as the Polish–Soviet War, the Irish Civil War, the Turkish War of Independence and the initial phase of the Chinese Civil War. After a peak of 381.17 on September 3, 1929, the bottom of the 1929 crash came just 2 months later on November 13, 1929, at 195.35 intraday, closing slightly higher at 198.69. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression over the next several years saw the Dow continue to fall until July 8, 1932, when it closed at 41.22, roughly two-thirds of its mid-1880s starting point and almost 90% below its peak. Overall for the 1920s decade, the Dow still ended with a healthy 131.7% gain, from 107.23 to 248.48 at the end of 1929. In inflation-adjusted numbers, the high of 381.17 on September 3, 1929, was not surpassed until 1954.

Marked by global instability and the Great Depression, the 1930s contended with several consequential European and Asian outbreaks of war, leading to the catastrophic World War II in 1939. Other conflicts during the decade which affected the stock market included the 1936–1939 Spanish Civil War, the 1935–1936 Second Italo-Abyssinian War, the Soviet-Japanese Border War of 1939, and the Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937. The United States experienced the Recession of 1937–1938, which temporarily brought economic recovery to a halt. The largest one-day percentage gain in the index happened in the depths of the 1930s bear market on March 15, 1933, when the Dow gained 15.34% to close at 62.10. However, as a whole throughout the Great Depression, the Dow posted some of its worst performances, for a negative return during most of the 1930s for new and old stock market investors. For the decade, the Dow Jones average was down from 248.48 at the beginning of 1930, to a stable level of 150.24 at the end of 1939, a loss of about 40%.

===1940s===
Post-war reconstruction during the 1940s, along with renewed optimism of peace and prosperity, brought about a 33% surge in the Dow from 150.24 to 200.13. The strength in the Dow occurred despite the Recession of 1949 and various global conflicts.

===1950s===
During the 1950s, the Korean War and the Cold War did not stop the Dow&#x27;s climb higher. A nearly 240% increase in the average from 200.13 to 679.36 ensued over the course of that decade.

===1960s===
The Dow began to stall during the 1960s as the markets trudged through the Kennedy Slide of 1962, but still managed an 18% gain from 679.36 to 800.36.

===1970s===
The 1970s marked a time of economic uncertainty and troubled relations between the U.S. and certain Middle-Eastern countries. The 1970s energy crisis was a prelude to a disastrous economic climate along with stagflation, the combination of high unemployment and high inflation. However, on November 14, 1972, the average closed at 1,003.16, above the 1,000 mark for the first time, during a brief relief rally in the midst of a lengthy bear market. Between January 1973 and December 1974, the average lost 48% of its value in what became known as the 1973–1974 stock market crash, closing at 577.60 on December 6, 1974. The nadir came after prices dropped more than 45% over two years since the NYSE&#x27;s high point of 1,003.16 on November 4, 1972. In 1976, the index reached 1,000 several times and it closed the year at 1,004.75. Although the Vietnam War ended in 1975, new tensions arose towards Iran surrounding the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Performance-wise for the 1970s, the index remained virtually flat, rising 4.8% from 800.36 to 838.74.

===1980s===

The 1980s began with the early 1980s recession. In early 1981, the index broke above 1,000 several times, but then retreated. After closing above 2,000 in January 1987, the largest one-day percentage drop occurred on Black Monday, October 19, 1987, when the average fell 22.61%. There were no clear reasons given to explain the crash.

On October 13, 1989, the Friday the 13th mini-crash, which initiated the collapse of the junk bond market, resulted in a loss of almost 7% of the index in a single day.

During the 1980s, the Dow increased 228% from 838.74 to 2,753.20; despite the market crashes, Silver Thursday, an early 1980s recession, the 1980s oil glut, the Japanese asset price bubble, and other political distractions. The index had only two negative years in the 1980s: in 1981 and 1984.

===1990s===
The 1990s brought on rapid advances in technology along with the introduction of the dot-com era. The markets contended with the 1990 oil price shock compounded with the effects of the early 1990s recession and a brief European situation surrounding Black Wednesday. Certain influential foreign conflicts such as the 1991 Soviet coup d&#x27;état attempt which took place as part of the initial stages of the Dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Revolutions of 1989; the First Chechen War and the Second Chechen War, the Gulf War, and the Yugoslav Wars failed to dampen economic enthusiasm surrounding the ongoing Information Age and the &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; (a phrase coined by Alan Greenspan) of the dot-com bubble. Between late 1992 and early 1993, the Dow staggered through the 3,000 level making only modest gains as the biotechnology sector suffered through the downfall of the Biotech Bubble; as many biotech companies saw their share prices rapidly rise to record levels and then subsequently fall to new all-time lows.

The Dow soared from 2,753 to 8,000 between January 1990 to July 1997. In October 1997, the events surrounding the 1997 Asian financial crisis plunged the Dow into a 554-point loss to a close of 7,161.15; a retrenchment of 7.18% in what became known as the October 27, 1997 mini-crash.

However, the Dow continued climbing past 9,000 despite negativity surrounding the 1998 Russian financial crisis along with the subsequent fallout from the 1998 collapse of Long-Term Capital Management due to bad bets placed on the movement of the Russian ruble.

On March 29, 1999, the average closed at 10,006.78, its first close above 10,000. This prompted a celebration on the New York Stock Exchange trading floor, complete with party hats. Total gains for the decade exceeded 315%; from 2,753.20 to 11,497.12, which equates to 12.3% annually.

The Dow averaged a 5.3% return compounded annually for the 20th century, a record Warren Buffett called &quot;a wonderful century&quot;; when he calculated that to achieve that return again, the index would need to close at about 2,000,000 by December 2099.

===2000s===

On September 17, 2001, the first day of trading after the September 11 attacks on the United States, the Dow fell 7.1%. However, the Dow began an upward trend shortly after the attacks, and regained all lost ground to close above 10,000 for the year. In 2002, the Dow dropped to a four-year low of 7,286 on September 24, 2002, due to the stock market downturn of 2002 and lingering effects of the dot-com bubble. Overall, while the NASDAQ index fell roughly 75% and the S&amp;P 500 index fell roughly 50% between 2000 and 2002, the Dow only fell 27% during the same period. In 2003, the Dow held steady within the 7,000 to 9,000-point level and recovered to the 10,000 mark by year end.

The Dow continued climbing and reached a record high of 14,198.10 on October 11, 2007, a mark which was not matched until March 2013. It then dropped over the next year due to the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

On September 15, 2008, a wider financial crisis became evident after the Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers along with the economic effect of record high oil prices which had reached almost $150 per barrel two months earlier. The Dow lost more than 500 points for the day, returning to its mid-July lows below 11,000. A series of bailout packages, including the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, proposed and implemented by the Federal Reserve and United States Department of the Treasury did not prevent further losses. After nearly six months of extreme volatility during which the Dow experienced its largest one-day point loss, largest daily point gain, and largest intraday range (of more than 1,000 points) at the time, the index closed at a new 12-year low of 6,547.05 on March 9, 2009, its lowest close since April 1997. The Dow had lost 20% of its value in only six weeks.

Towards the latter half of 2009, the average rallied towards the 10,000 level amid optimism that the Great Recession, the United States housing bubble and the 2007–2008 financial crisis, were easing and possibly coming to an end. For the decade, the Dow saw a rather substantial pullback for a negative return from 11,497.12 to 10,428.05, a loss of a 9.3%.

===2010s===

During the first half of the 2010s decade, aided by the Federal Reserve&#x27;s loose monetary policy including quantitative easing, the Dow made a notable rally attempt. This was despite significant volatility due to growing global concerns such as the European debt crisis, the Dubai World 2009 debt standstill, and the 2011 United States debt-ceiling crisis.

On May 6, 2010, the Dow lost 9.2% intra-day and regained nearly all of it within a single hour. This event, which became known as the 2010 Flash Crash, sparked new regulations to prevent future incidents.

Six years after its previous high in 2007, the Dow finally closed at a new record high on March 5, 2013. It continued rising for the next several years past 17,000 points until a brief 2015–2016 stock market selloff in the second half of 2015. It then picked up again in early 2016 and climbed past 25,000 points on January 4, 2018.

On November 9, 2016, the day after Donald Trump&#x27;s victory over Hillary Clinton in the U.S. presidential election, the index soared, coming within roughly 25 points of its all-time intraday high to that point.

Volatility returned in 2018 when the Dow fell nearly 20%. By early January 2019, the index had quickly rallied more than 10% from its Christmas Eve low.

Overall in the 2010s decade, the Dow increased from 10,428.05 to 28,538.44 for a substantial gain of 174%.

===2020s===
Despite the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, the Dow continued its bull run from the previous decade before peaking at 29,551.42 on February 12, 2020 (29,568.57 intraday on the same day). The index slowly retreated for the remainder of the week and into the next week, before coronavirus fears and an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia sent the index into a tailspin, recording several days of losses (and gains) of at least 1,000 points, a typical symptom of a bear market as previously seen in October 2008 during the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Volatility rose high enough to trigger multiple 15-minute trading halts. In the first quarter of 2020, the DJIA fell 23%, its worst quarter since 1987. The market recovered in the third quarter, returning to 28,837.52 on October 12, 2020, and peaked momentarily at a new all-time high of 29,675.25 on November 9, 2020, at 14:00 ET, following that day&#x27;s announcement of the success of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in Phase III clinical trials. The Dow (as reported by the United Press International) closed over 30,000 on December 31, 2020, at a record 30,606.48. On November 24, following news that the presidential transition of Joe Biden was approved, the Dow increased by more than 500 points, closing at 30,046.24. On January 22, 2024, the Dow Jones crossed 38,000 points for the first time; a month later it surpassed 39,000; and in May, it surpassed 40,000 points.

==Computation==
The DJIA is computed as the sum of the prices of all thirty stocks divided by a divisor, the Dow Divisor. The divisor is adjusted in case of stock splits, spinoffs or similar structural changes, to ensure that such events do not in themselves alter the numerical value of the DJIA. Early on, the initial divisor was composed of the original number of component companies; this initially made the DJIA a simple arithmetic average. The present divisor, after many adjustments, is less than one, making the index larger than the sum of the prices of the components. That is:
:formula_1
where p are the prices of the component stocks and d is the &quot;Dow Divisor&quot;.

Events such as stock splits or changes in the list of the companies composing the index alter the sum of the component prices. In these cases, in order to avoid discontinuity in the index, the Dow Divisor is updated so that the quotations right before and after the event coincide:

:formula_2

 the Dow Divisor is 0.16268413125742 and every $1 change in price in a particular stock within the average equates to a 6.146881 (or 1 ÷ 0.16268413125742) point movement.

==Assessment==

=== Quality as a proxy of the stock market ===
Despite its unusual weighting by price rather than market capitalization, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is highly correlated with other proxies of the US equities market, particularly the S&amp;P 500 Index. Between , the DJIA returned an annualized 8.90%, with the S&amp;P 500 returning a nearly identical 8.91%.

=== Issues with market representation ===
With the inclusion of only 30 stocks, critics such as Ric Edelman argue that the DJIA is an inaccurate representation of overall market performance compared to more comprehensive indices such as the S&amp;P 500 Index or the Russell 3000 Index. Additionally, the DJIA is criticized for being a price-weighted index, which gives higher-priced stocks more influence over the average than their lower-priced counterparts, but takes no account of the relative industry size or market capitalization of the components. For example, a $1 increase in a lower-priced stock can be negated by a $1 decrease in a much higher-priced stock, even though the lower-priced stock experienced a larger percentage change. In addition, a $1 move in the smallest component of the DJIA has the same effect as a $1 move in the largest component of the average. For example, during September–October 2008, former component AIG&#x27;s reverse split-adjusted stock price collapsed from $22.76 on September 8 to $1.35 on October 27; contributing to a roughly 3,000-point drop in the index.

 Goldman Sachs and UnitedHealth Group are among the highest-priced stocks in the average and therefore have the greatest influence on it. Alternately, Cisco Systems and Coca-Cola are among the lowest-priced stocks in the average and have the least sway in the price movement. Critics of the DJIA and most securities professionals recommend the market-capitalization weighted S&amp;P 500 Index or the Wilshire 5000, the latter of which includes most publicly listed U.S. stocks, as better indicators of the U.S. stock market.

===Correlation among components===
A study between the correlation of components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average compared with the movement of the index finds that the correlation is higher when the stocks are declining. The correlation is lowest in a time when the average is flat or rises a modest amount.

<text>The Council of Ephesus was a council of Christian bishops convened in Ephesus (near present-day Selçuk in Turkey) in AD 431 by the Roman Emperor Theodosius II. This third ecumenical council, an effort to attain consensus in the church through an assembly representing all of Christendom, confirmed the original Nicene Creed, and condemned the teachings of Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople, who held that the Virgin Mary may be called the &quot;Christotokos&quot;, &quot;Christ-bearer&quot; but not the &quot;Theotokos&quot;, &quot;God-bearer&quot;. It met from 22 June to 31 July 431 at the Church of Mary in Ephesus in Anatolia.

==Background==
Nestorius&#x27; doctrine, Nestorianism, which emphasized the distinction between Christ&#x27;s human and divine natures and argued that Mary should be called &quot;Christotokos&quot; (Christ-bearer) but not &quot;Theotokos&quot; (God-bearer), had brought him into conflict with other church leaders, most notably Cyril, Patriarch of Alexandria. Nestorius himself had requested the Emperor to convene the council, hoping that it would prove his orthodoxy; the council in fact condemned his teachings as heresy. The council declared Mary as &quot;Theotokos&quot; (Mother of God).

Nestorius&#x27; dispute with Cyril had led the latter to seek validation from Pope Celestine I, who offered his support for Cyril to request that Nestorius recant his position or face excommunication. Nestorius pleaded with the Eastern Roman Emperor Theodosius II to call a council in which all grievances could be aired, hoping that he would be vindicated and Cyril condemned.

Approximately 250 bishops were present. The proceedings were conducted in a heated atmosphere of confrontation and recriminations and created severe tensions between Cyril and Theodosius II. Nestorius was decisively outplayed by Cyril and removed from his see, and his teachings were officially anathematized. This precipitated the Nestorian Schism, by which churches supportive of Nestorius, especially in the Persian Empire of the Sassanids, were severed from the rest of Christendom and became known as Nestorian Christianity, or the Church of the East, whose present-day representatives are the Assyrian Church of the East, the Ancient Church of the East, the Chaldean Syrian Church, and the Chaldean Catholic Church (which restored communion with Rome). 

==History==
===Political context===
John McGuckin cites the &quot;innate rivalry&quot; between Alexandria and Constantinople as an important factor in the controversy between Cyril of Alexandria and Nestorius. However, he emphasizes that, as much as political competition contributed to an &quot;overall climate of dissent&quot;, the controversy cannot be reduced merely to the level of &quot;personality clashes&quot; or &quot;political antagonisms&quot;. According to McGuckin, Cyril viewed the &quot;elevated intellectual argument about christology&quot; as ultimately one and the same as the &quot;validity and security of the simple Christian life&quot;.

Even within Constantinople, some supported the Roman-Alexandrian and others supported the Nestorian factions. For example, Pulcheria supported the Roman-Alexandrian popes while the emperor and his wife supported Nestorius.

===Theological context===
Contention over Nestorius&#x27; teachings, which he developed during his studies at the School of Antioch, largely revolved around his rejection of the long-used title &quot;Theotokos&quot; (&quot;Carrier of God&quot;) for the Virgin Mary. Shortly after his arrival in Constantinople, Nestorius became involved in the disputes of two theological factions, which differed in their Christology.

McGuckin ascribes Nestorius&#x27; importance to his being the representative of the Antiochene tradition and characterizes him as a &quot;consistent, if none too clear, exponent of the longstanding Antiochene dogmatic tradition.&quot; Nestorius was greatly surprised that what he had always taught in Antioch without any controversy whatsoever should prove to be so objectionable to the Christians of Constantinople. Nestorius emphasized the dual natures of Christ, trying to find a middle ground between those who emphasized the fact that in Christ God had been born as a man, and who insisted on calling the Virgin Mary &quot;Theotokos&quot; (Greek: Θεοτόκος, &quot;God-bearer&quot;), and those that rejected that title because God as an eternal being could not have been born. Nestorius suggested the title &quot;Christotokos&quot; (&quot;Χριστοτόκος&quot;, &quot;Christ-bearer&quot;), but this proposal did not gain acceptance on either side.

Nestorius tried to answer a question considered unsolved: &quot;How can Jesus Christ, being part man, not be partially a sinner as well, since man is by definition a sinner since the Fall?&quot; To solve that he taught that Mary, the mother of Jesus gave birth to the incarnate Christ, not the divine Logos who existed before Mary and indeed before time itself. The Logos occupied the part of the human soul (the part of man that was stained by the Fall). But wouldn&#x27;t the absence of a human soul make Jesus less human? Nestorius rejected this proposition, answering that, because the human soul was based on the archetype of the Logos, only to become polluted by the Fall, Jesus was &quot;more&quot; human for having the Logos and not &quot;less&quot;. Consequently, Nestorius argued that the Virgin Mary should be called &quot;Christotokos&quot;, Greek for &quot;Carrier of Christ&quot;, and not &quot;Theotokos&quot;, Greek for &quot;Carrier of God&quot;.

Nestorius believed that no union between the human and divine was possible. If such a union of human and divine occurred, Nestorius believed that Christ could not truly be consubstantial with God and consubstantial with us because he would grow, mature, suffer and die (which Nestorius argued God cannot do) and also would possess the power of God that would separate him from being equal to humans.

According to McGuckin, several mid-twentieth-century accounts have tended to &quot;romanticise&quot; Nestorius; in opposition to this view, he asserts that Nestorius was no less dogmatic and uncompromising than Cyril, and that he was clearly just as prepared to use his political and canonical powers as Cyril or any of the other hierarchs of the period.

Nestorius&#x27;s opponents charged him with detaching Christ&#x27;s divinity and humanity into two persons existing in one body, thereby denying the reality of the Incarnation. Eusebius, a layman who later became the bishop of the neighbouring Dorylaeum was the first to accuse Nestorius of heresy, but his most forceful opponent was Patriarch Cyril of Alexandria. Cyril argued that Nestorianism split Jesus in half and denied that he was both human and divine.

Cyril appealed to Pope Celestine I, charging Nestorius with heresy. The Pope agreed and gave Cyril his authority to serve a notice to Nestorius to recant his views within ten days or else be excommunicated. Before acting on the Pope&#x27;s commission, Cyril convened a synod of Egyptian bishops which condemned Nestorius as well. Cyril then sent four suffragan bishops to deliver both the Pope&#x27;s commission as well as the synodal letter of the Egyptian bishops. Cyril sent a letter to Nestorius known as &quot;The Third Epistle of Saint Cyril to Nestorius.&quot; This epistle drew heavily on the established Patristic Constitutions and contained the most famous article of Alexandrian Orthodoxy: &quot;The Twelve Anathemas of Saint Cyril.&quot; In these anathemas, Cyril excommunicated anyone who followed the teachings of Nestorius. For example, &quot;Anyone who dares to deny the Holy Virgin the title &quot;Theotokos&quot; is Anathema!&quot; Nestorius however, still would not repent.
McGuckin points out that other representatives of the Antiochene tradition such as John of Antioch, Theodoret and Andrew of Samosata were able to recognize &quot;the point of the argument for Christ&#x27;s integrity&quot; and concede the &quot;ill-advised nature of Nestorius&#x27; immoveability.&quot; Concerned at the potential for a negative result at a council, they urged Nestorius to yield and accept the use of the title &quot;Theotokos&quot; when referring to the Virgin Mary.

For example, John of Antioch wrote to Nestorius urging him to submit to the Pope&#x27;s judgment and cease stirring up controversy over a word that he disliked (Theotokos) but which could be interpreted as having an orthodox meaning especially in light of the fact that many saints and doctors of the church had sanctioned the word by using it themselves. John wrote to Nestorius, &quot;Don&#x27;t lose your head. Ten days! It will not take you twenty-four hours to give the needed answer... Ask advice of men you can trust. Ask them to tell you the facts, not just what they think will please you... You have the whole of the East against you, as well as Egypt.&quot; Despite this advice from his colleagues, Nestorius persisted in maintaining the rightness of his position.

===Convocation===

On 19 November, Nestorius, anticipating the ultimatum which was about to be delivered, convinced Emperor Theodosius II to summon a general council through which Nestorius hoped to convict Cyril of heresy and thereby vindicate his own teachings. Theodosius issued a Sacra calling for the metropolitan bishops to assemble in the city of Ephesus, which was a special seat for the veneration of Mary, where the &quot;theotokos&quot; formula was popular. Each bishop was to bring only his more eminent suffragans. The date set by the Emperor for the opening of the council was Pentecost (7 June) 431.

McGuckin notes that the vagueness of the Sacra resulted in wide variations of interpretation by different bishops. In particular, the vastness of John of Antioch&#x27;s ecclesiastical territory required a lengthy period to notify and gather his delegates. Because the overland trip from Antioch to Ephesus was long and arduous, John composed his delegation of his metropolitan bishops who were restricted to bring no more than two suffragans each. By doing so, he minimized the number who would have to travel to Ephesus.
Neither of the emperors attended the council. Theodosius appointed Count Candidian as the head of the imperial palace guard to represent him, to supervise the proceedings of the Council, and to keep good order in the city of Ephesus. Despite Nestorius&#x27; agenda of prosecuting Cyril, Theodosius intended for the council to focus strictly on the christological controversy. He thus gave Candidianus strict directions to remain neutral and not to interfere in the theological proceedings. It is generally assumed that Candidian initially maintained his neutrality as instructed by the emperor and only gradually became more biased towards Nestorius. McGuckin, however, suggests that Candidian may have favored Nestorius from the start.

===Assembly===
Celestine sent Arcadius and Projectus, to represent himself and his Roman council; in addition, he sent the Roman priest, Philip, as his personal representative. Cyril Patriarch of Alexandria was president of the council. Celestine had directed the papal legates not to take part in the discussions, but to give judgment on them.

Bishops arrived in Ephesus over a period of several weeks. While waiting for the other bishops to arrive, they engaged in informal discussions characterized as tending to &quot;exasperate rather than heal their differences&quot;. The metropolitan of Ephesus, Memnon, was already present with his 52 bishops. Nestorius and his 16 bishops were the first to arrive shortly after Easter. As archbishop of the imperial city of Constantinople, he traveled with a detachment of troops who were under the command of Count Candidian. McGuckin notes that the troops were not there to serve as Nestorius&#x27; bodyguard but to support Candidian in his role as the emperor&#x27;s representative. However, McGuckin theorizes that Candidian&#x27;s progressive abandonment of neutrality in favor of Nestorius may have created the perception that Candidian&#x27;s troops were, in fact, there to support Nestorius. Candidian ordered all monks and lay strangers to leave the city; he further instructed the bishops not to leave on any pretext until the council was concluded. Several sources comment that the purpose of this injunction was to prevent bishops from leaving the council to appeal to the emperor directly.

According to McGuckin, Memnon, as bishop of Ephesus, commanded the &quot;fervent and unquestioned loyalty&quot; of the local populace and thus could count on the support of local factions to counterbalance the military might of Candidian&#x27;s troops. In view of the verdict of Rome against Nestorius, Memnon refused to have communion with Nestorius, closing the churches of Ephesus to him.

Cyril brought with him 50 bishops, arriving only a few days before Pentecost. There were very few bishops representing the West, as the papal representatives would not arrive until July. The Palestinian delegation of 16 bishops and Metropolitan Flavian of Philippi arrived 5 days after the date that had been set for opening the council, and aligned themselves with Cyril.

At this point, Cyril announced his intention to open the council; however, Candidian enjoined him from doing so on the grounds that the Roman and Antiochean delegations had not arrived yet. Cyril initially acceded to Candidian&#x27;s injunction knowing that he could not legally convene a council without the official reading of the Emperor&#x27;s Sacra.

A number of bishops, who were undecided between Nestorius and Cyril, did not want to give Cyril, as one party in the dispute, the right to chair the meeting and decide the agenda; however, they began to take Cyril&#x27;s side for various reasons.

Various circumstances including a detour necessitated by flooding as well as sickness and death of some of the delegates seriously delayed John of Antioch and his bishops. It was rumored that John might be delaying his arrival in order to avoid participating in a council which was likely to condemn Nestorius as a heretic.

===First session – 22 June 431===
Two weeks after the date set for the council, John and the bulk of his Syrian group (42 members) had not yet appeared. At this point, Cyril formally opened the council on Monday, 22 June by enthroning the Gospels in the centre of the church, as a symbol of Christ&#x27;s presence among the assembled bishops.

Despite three separate summons, Nestorius refused to acknowledge Cyril&#x27;s authority to stand in judgment of him and considered the opening of the council before the arrival of the Antiochene contingent as a &quot;flagrant injustice&quot;. The 68 bishops who opposed opening the council entered the church in protest, arriving with Count Candidian who declared that the assembly was illegal and must disperse. He urged Cyril to wait four more days for the Syrian delegation to arrive. However, since even the bishops opposed to opening the council were now present, Cyril maneuvered Candidian by means of a ruse to read out the text of the Emperor&#x27;s decree of convocation, which the assembly then acclaimed as recognition of its own legality.

===Arrival of the Antiochene delegation===
When John of Antioch and his Syrian bishops finally reached Ephesus five days after the council, they met with Candidian who informed them that Cyril had begun a council without them and had ratified Celestine&#x27;s conviction of Nestorius as a heretic. Angered at having undertaken such a long and arduous journey only to have been pre-empted by actions taken by Cyril&#x27;s council, John and the Syrian bishops held their own Council with Candidian presiding. This council condemned Cyril for espousing the Arian, Apollinarian and Eunomian heresies and condemned Memnon for inciting violence. The bishops at this council deposed both Cyril and Memnon. Initially, the emperor concurred with the actions of John&#x27;s council but eventually withdrew his concurrence.

===Second Session – 10 July 431===
The second session was held in Memnon&#x27;s episcopal residence. Philip, as papal legate, opened the proceedings by commenting that the present question regarding Nestorius had already been decided by Pope Celestine as evidenced by his letter, which had been read to the assembled bishops in the first session. He indicated that he had a second letter from Celestine which was read to the bishops now in attendance. The letter contained a general exhortation to the council, and concluded by saying that the legates had instructions to carry out what the pope had decided on the question and expressed Celestine&#x27;s confidence that the council would agree. The bishops indicated their approval by acclaiming Celestine and Cyril. Projectus indicated that the papal letter enjoined the council to put into effect the sentence pronounced by Celestine. Firmus, the Exarch of Caesarea in Cappadocia, responded that the pope&#x27;s sentence had already been carried out in the first session. The session closed with the reading of the pope&#x27;s letter to the emperor.

===Third Session – 11 July 431===
Having read the Acts of the first session, the papal legates indicated that all that was required was that the council&#x27;s condemnation of Nestorius be formally read in their presence. When this had been done, the three legates each confirmed the council&#x27;s actions, signing the Acts of all three sessions. The council sent a letter to Theodosius indicating that the condemnation of Nestorius had been agreed upon not only by the bishops of the East meeting in Ephesus but also of the bishops of the West who had convened at a synod in Rome convened by Celestine. The bishops asked Theodosius to allow them to go home since so many of them suffered from their presence at Ephesus.

===Fourth Session – 16 July 431===
At the fourth session, Cyril and Memnon presented a formal protest against John of Antioch for convening a separate conciliabulum. The council issued a summons for him to appear before them, but he would not even receive the envoys who were sent to serve him the summons.

===Fifth Session – 17 July 431===
Next day the fifth session was held in the same church. John had set up a placard in the city accusing the synod of the Apollinarian heresy. He was again cited, and this was counted as the third canonical summons. He paid no attention. In consequence the council suspended and excommunicated him, together with thirty-four bishops of his party, but refrained from deposing them. Some of John&#x27;s party had already deserted him, and he had gained only a few. In the letters to the emperor and the pope which were then dispatched, the synod described itself as now consisting of 210 bishops. The long letter to Celestine gave a full account of the council, and mentioned that the pope&#x27;s decrees against the Pelagians had been read and confirmed.

===Sixth Session – 22 July 431===
At this session, the bishops approved Canon 7 which condemned any departure from the creed established by the First Council of Nicaea, in particular an exposition by the priest Charisius. According to a report from Cyril to Celestine, Juvenal of Jerusalem tried and failed to create for himself a patriarchate from the territory of the Antiochene patriarchate in which his see lay. He ultimately succeeded in this goal twenty years later at the Council of Chalcedon.

===Seventh Session – 31 August 431===
At this session, the council approved the claim of the bishops of Cyprus that their see had been anciently and rightly exempt from the jurisdiction of Antioch. The council also passed five canons condemning Nestorius and Caelestius and their followers as heretics and a sixth one decreeing deposition from clerical office or excommunication for those who did not accept the Council&#x27;s decrees.

==Canons and declarations==

Eight canons were passed:
* Canon 1–5 condemned Nestorius and Caelestius and their followers as heretics
* Canon 6 decreed deposition from clerical office or excommunication for those who did not accept the Council&#x27;s decrees
* Canon 7 condemned any departure from the creed established by the First Council of Nicaea (325), in particular an exposition by the priest Charisius.
* Canon 8 condemned interference by the Bishop of Antioch in affairs of the Church in Cyprus and decreed generally, that no bishop was to &quot;assume control of any province which has not heretofore, from the very beginning, been under his own hand or that of his predecessors […] lest the Canons of the Fathers be transgressed&quot;.

The Council denounced Nestorius&#x27; teaching as erroneous and decreed that Jesus was one person (hypostasis), and not two separate persons, yet possessing both a human and divine nature. The Virgin Mary was to be called Theotokos, a Greek word that means &quot;God-bearer&quot; (the one who gave birth to God).

The Council declared it &quot;unlawful for any man to bring forward, or to write, or to compose a different (ἑτέραν) Faith as a rival to that established by the holy Fathers assembled with the Holy Ghost in Nicæa&quot;. It quoted the Nicene Creed as adopted by the First Council of Nicaea in 325, not as added to and modified by the First Council of Constantinople in 381.

Although some scholars, such as Norman Cohn and Peter Toon, have suggested that the Council of Ephesus rejected premillennialism, this is a misconception, and there is no evidence of the Council making any such declaration.

==Confirmation of the Council&#x27;s acts==
The bishops at Cyril&#x27;s council outnumbered those at John of Antioch&#x27;s council by nearly four to one. In addition, they had the agreement of the papal legates and the support of the population of Ephesus who supported their bishop, Memnon.

However, Count Candidian and his troops supported Nestorius as did Count Irenaeus. The emperor had always been a firm supporter of Nestorius, but had been somewhat shaken by the reports of the council. Cyril&#x27;s group was unable to communicate with the emperor because of interference from supporters of Nestorius both at Constantinople and at Ephesus. Ultimately, a messenger disguised as a beggar was able to carry a letter to Constantinople by hiding it in a hollow cane.

Although Emperor Theodosius had long been a staunch supporter of Nestorius, his loyalty seems to have been shaken by the reports from Cyril&#x27;s council and caused him to arrive at the extraordinary decision to ratify the depositions decreed by both councils. Thus, he declared that Cyril, Memnon, and John were all deposed. Memnon and Cyril were kept in close confinement. But in spite of all the efforts of the Antiochene party, the representatives of the envoys whom the council was eventually allowed to send, with the legate Philip, to the Court, persuaded the emperor to accept Cyril&#x27;s council as the true one. Seeing the writing on the wall and anticipating his fate, Nestorius requested permission to retire to his former monastery. The synod was dissolved in the beginning of October, and Cyril arrived amid much joy at Alexandria on 30 October. Pope Celestine had died on 27 July but his successor, Sixtus III, gave papal confirmation to the council&#x27;s actions.

==Aftermath==
The events created a major schism between the followers of the different versions of the council, which was only mended by difficult negotiations. The factions that supported John of Antioch acquiesced in the condemnation of Nestorius and, after additional clarifications, accepted the decisions of Cyril&#x27;s council. However, the rift would open again during the debates leading up to the Council of Chalcedon.

Persia had long been home to a Christian community that had been persecuted by the Zoroastrian majority, which had accused it of Roman leanings. In 424, the Persian Church declared itself independent of the Byzantine and all other churches, in order to ward off allegations of foreign allegiance. Following the Nestorian Schism, the Persian Church increasingly aligned itself with the Nestorians, a measure encouraged by the Zoroastrian ruling class. The Persian Church became increasingly Nestorian in doctrine over the next decades, furthering the divide between Christianity in Persia and in the Roman Empire. In 486 the Metropolitan of Nisibis, Barsauma, publicly accepted Nestorius&#x27; mentor, Theodore of Mopsuestia, as a spiritual authority. In 489 when the School of Edessa in Mesopotamia was closed by Byzantine Emperor Zeno for its Nestorian teachings, the school relocated to its original home of Nisibis, becoming again the School of Nisibis, leading to a wave of Nestorian immigration into Persia. The Persian patriarch Mar Babai I (497–502) reiterated and expanded upon the church&#x27;s esteem for Theodore, solidifying the church&#x27;s adoption of Nestorianism.

===Conciliation===
In 1994, the Common Christological Declaration between the Catholic Church and the Assyrian Church of the East marked the resolution of a dispute between those two churches that had existed since the Council of Ephesus. They expressed their common understanding of doctrine concerning the divinity and humanity of Christ, and recognized the legitimacy and rightness of their respective descriptions of Mary as, on the Assyrian side, &quot;the Mother of Christ our God and Saviour&quot;, and, on the Catholic side, as &quot;the Mother of God&quot; and also as &quot;the Mother of Christ&quot;.

<doc id="47367" wikidata="Q272233" url="?curid=47367" title="Æthelred I of Wessex">
<text>Æthelred I (alt. Aethelred, Ethelred; ; 845/848 to 871) was King of Wessex from 865 until his death in 871. He was the fourth of five sons of King Æthelwulf of Wessex, four of whom in turn became king. Æthelred succeeded his elder brother Æthelberht and was followed by his youngest brother, Alfred the Great. Æthelred had two sons, Æthelhelm and Æthelwold, who were passed over for the kingship on their father&#x27;s death because they were still infants. Alfred was succeeded by his son, Edward the Elder, and Æthelwold unsuccessfully disputed the throne with him.

Æthelred&#x27;s accession coincided with the arrival of the Viking Great Heathen Army in England. Over the next five years the Vikings conquered Northumbria and East Anglia, and at the end of 870 they launched a full-scale attack on Wessex. In early January 871, Æthelred was defeated at the Battle of Reading. Four days later, he scored a victory in the Battle of Ashdown, but this was followed by two defeats at Basing and Meretun. He died shortly after Easter. Alfred was forced to pay off the Vikings, but he scored a decisive victory over them seven years later at the Battle of Edington.

Æthelred&#x27;s reign was important numismatically. Wessex and Mercia were close allies when he became king, and he carried the alliance further by adopting the Mercian Lunettes design, thus creating a unified coinage design for southern England for the first time. The common design foreshadowed the unification of England over the next sixty years and the reform coinage of King Edgar a century later.

== Background ==

Æthelred&#x27;s grandfather, Ecgberht, became king of Wessex in 802, and in the view of the historian Richard Abels, it must have seemed very unlikely to contemporaries that he would establish a lasting dynasty. For two hundred years, three families had fought for the West Saxon throne, and no son had followed his father as king. No ancestor of Ecgberht had been a king of Wessex since Ceawlin in the late sixth century, but he was believed to be a paternal descendant of Cerdic, the founder of the West Saxon dynasty. This made Ecgberht an ætheling – a prince eligible for the throne. But after Ecgberht&#x27;s reign, descent from Cerdic was no longer sufficient to make a man an ætheling. When Ecgberht died in 839 he was succeeded by his son Æthelwulf; all subsequent West Saxon kings were Ecgberht&#x27;s descendants and were also sons of kings. 

At the beginning of the ninth century, England was almost wholly under the control of the Anglo-Saxons. The Midland kingdom of Mercia dominated southern England, but its supremacy came to an end in 825 when it was decisively defeated by Ecgberht at the Battle of Ellendun. The two kingdoms became allies, which was important in the resistance to Viking attacks. In 853, King Burgred of Mercia requested West Saxon help to suppress a Welsh rebellion, and Æthelwulf led a West Saxon contingent in a successful joint campaign. In the same year Burgred married Æthelwulf&#x27;s daughter, Æthelswith.

In 825, Ecgberht sent Æthelwulf to invade the Mercian sub-kingdom of Kent, and its underking, Baldred, was driven out shortly afterwards. By 830, Essex, Surrey and Sussex had also submitted to Ecgberht, and he had appointed Æthelwulf to rule the south-eastern territories as King of Kent. The Vikings ravaged the Isle of Sheppey in 835, and the following year they defeated Ecgberht at Carhampton in Somerset, but in 838 he was victorious over an alliance of Cornishmen and Vikings at the Battle of Hingston Down, reducing Cornwall to the status of a client kingdom. When Æthelwulf succeeded, he appointed his eldest son Æthelstan (who died in the early 850s) as sub-king of Kent. Ecgberht and Æthelwulf might not have intended a permanent union between Wessex and Kent as they both appointed sons as underkings and charters in Wessex were attested (witnessed) by West Saxon magnates, while Kentish charters were witnessed by the Kentish elite; both kings kept overall control and the underkings were not allowed to issue their own coinage.

Viking raids increased in the early 840s on both sides of the English Channel, and in 843 Æthelwulf was defeated at Carhampton. In 850, Æthelstan defeated a Danish fleet off Sandwich in the first recorded naval battle in English history. In 851 Æthelwulf and his second son Æthelbald defeated the Vikings at the Battle of Aclea and, according to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, &quot;there made the greatest slaughter of a heathen raiding-army that we have heard tell of up to this present day, and there took the victory&quot;. Æthelwulf died in 858 and was succeeded by his oldest surviving son, Æthelbald, as king of Wessex and by his next oldest son, Æthelberht, as king of Kent. Æthelbald only survived his father by two years and Æthelberht then for the first time united Wessex and Kent into a single kingdom.

== Early life ==
Æthelred was the fourth of five sons of King Æthelwulf. His mother, Osburh, was of West Saxon royal descent. According to the historian Sean Miller, Æthelred was probably a year or so older than his younger brother, the future Alfred the Great, who was born 848–9, but Richard Abels says that Æthelred was around eight years old in 853, which would mean he was born about 845. Manuscript A of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, which was written in the 890s, states that in 853 Alfred was sent by his father to Rome and was consecrated by the Pope as king. Historians do not believe that he was consecrated king at this young age and the real nature of the ceremony is explained in an extract from a letter of Pope Leo IV to Æthelwulf, which records that he decorated Alfred &quot;as a spiritual son, with the dignity of the belt and the vestments of the consulate, as is customary with Roman consuls&quot;. The contemporary &quot;Liber Vitae&quot; (confraternity book) of San Salvatore, Brescia, records the names of both Æthelred and Alfred, indicating that both brothers went to Rome. It is likely that Æthelred was also decorated by the pope, but the ceremony was later regarded as foreshadowing Alfred&#x27;s greatness and neither the chronicler nor the eleventh-century extractor from the Pope&#x27;s letters were interested in recording the presence of his lesser known elder brother.

Æthelred first witnessed his father&#x27;s charters as &quot;filius regis&quot; (king&#x27;s son) in 854, and he witnessed with this title until he succeeded to the throne in 865. He may have acted as an underking before his accession, as in 862 and 863 he issued his own charters as King of the West Saxons. This must have been as deputy or in the absence of his elder brother, King Æthelberht, as there is no record of conflict between them and he continued to witness his brother&#x27;s charters as a king&#x27;s son in 864.

== Reign ==
=== Civilian rule ===
Æthelred succeeded to the throne on Æthelberht&#x27;s death in 865, and he married Wulfthryth at an unknown date. West Saxon kings&#x27; wives had a low status in the ninth century and very little is known about them. They were not usually given the title of &quot;regina&quot; (queen), an omission which Alfred the Great justified on the ground of the misconduct of a queen at the beginning of the ninth century. The name of Æthelred&#x27;s wife is only known because she was recorded as a witness to one charter, S 340 of 868, where she is shown as &quot;Wulfthryth regina&quot;, suggesting that she had a higher status than other kings&#x27; wives. The only other ninth century king&#x27;s wife known to have been given the title was Æthelwulf&#x27;s second wife, Judith of Flanders, a great-granddaughter of Charlemagne. Wulfthryth and Æthelred had two known sons, Æthelhelm and Æthelwold. She might have been Mercian or a daughter of Wulfhere, Ealdorman of Wiltshire, who forfeited his lands after being charged with deserting King Alfred for the Danes in about 878, perhaps because he attempted to secure Viking support for his elder grandson Æthelhelm&#x27;s claim to the throne against Alfred.

Alfred records in the preamble to his will that Æthelwulf had left property jointly to three of his sons, Æthelbald, Æthelred and Alfred, with the proviso that the brother who lived longest would succeed to all of it. When Æthelbald died in 860, Æthelred and Alfred, who were still young, agreed to entrust their share to the new king, Æthelberht, on a promise that he would return it to them intact. When Æthelred succeeded to the throne, Alfred asked him at a meeting of the witan (assembly of leading men) to give him his share of the property. However, Æthelred said that he had attempted many times to divide it but had found it too difficult, and he would instead leave the whole to Alfred on his death. Some historians see the bequest as including the whole of Æthelwulf&#x27;s bookland, his personal property which he could leave in his will (as opposed to the folkland which passed according to customary law and property earmarked for the support of the crown); it is further argued that it was considered desirable that the bookland would be kept by the king, so Æthelwulf&#x27;s provision implies that the throne would pass to each brother in turn. However, other historians assert that the bequest had nothing to do with the kingship, and Alfred Smyth argues that the bequest was provision for Æthelwulf&#x27;s young sons when they reached adulthood, with Æthelbald as trustee and residuary beneficiary if they died young. When Alfred succeeded, the supporters of Æthelred&#x27;s infant sons complained that Alfred should have shared the property with them, and Alfred had his father&#x27;s will read to a meeting of the witan to prove his right to keep the whole of the property. Alfred rarely witnessed Æthelred&#x27;s charters, and this together with the argument over their father&#x27;s will suggests that they were not on good terms. The historian Pauline Stafford suggests that Æthelred chose to highlight his wife&#x27;s status as queen in a charter to assert his own sons&#x27; claims to the succession.

In 868, Æthelred issued a charter which was attested by a Mercian ætheling and himself attested a charter issued by his sister, Æthelswith, as queen of Mercia. Æthelred used several different titles in his charters. He is called by his father&#x27;s usual title, &quot;Rex Occidentalium Saxonum&quot; (King of the West Saxons) in the charter of Ealhswith which he witnessed, and in five of his own. He is &quot;King of the West Saxons and the Men of Kent&quot; in two, and &quot;King&quot; and &quot;King of the Saxons&quot; in one each. The West Saxon charters of Æthelred and his elder brothers followed a uniform style, suggesting that they were produced by a single agency which operated over a number of years.

=== The Viking invasions ===
The character of Viking attacks on England decisively changed in the year that Æthelred succeeded to the throne. Previously the country had suffered from sporadic raids, but now it faced an invasion aiming at conquest and settlement. A large force of Vikings, called by contemporaries the Great Heathen Army, arrived in East Anglia. King Edmund purchased peace by paying tribute and the Vikings stayed a year building up their strength. They then marched on York and conquered Northumbria, installing a puppet king. In late 867, they took Nottingham in Mercia and spent the winter there. Æthelred&#x27;s brother-in-law, King Burgred, appealed to him for help. Æthelred and Alfred led a large West Saxon army to Nottingham and besieged the Vikings, but they refused to leave the safety of the town&#x27;s defences. The combined Mercian and West Saxon armies were unable to breach the earth ramparts and ditch, and eventually Burgred bought them off. The Vikings then went back to York.

In 869, the Vikings returned to East Anglia and conquered the kingdom, killing King Edmund. In December 870, they launched an attempt to conquer Wessex led by Kings Bagsecg and Halfdan. They occupied Reading on around 28 December. The town is between the Thames and Kennet rivers, and they set about building a ditch and rampart on the southern side between the two rivers. Three days after their arrival they sent out a large foraging party, which was defeated by an army of local levies under the command of Æthelwulf, Ealdorman of Berkshire, at the Battle of Englefield. After another four days, on about 4 January 871, Æthelred and Alfred brought up the main West Saxon army and joined Æthelwulf&#x27;s forces for an attack on the Danes in the Battle of Reading. The West Saxons fought their way to the town, slaughtering all the Danes they found outside, but when they reached the town gate the Vikings burst out and defeated the West Saxons with a successful counter-attack. Among the dead was Æthelwulf, whose body was secretly carried off to be buried in his native Derby. According to the twelfth-century chronicler Gaimar, Æthelred and Alfred only escaped due to their better knowledge of the local terrain, which allowed them to lose their pursuers by fording the River Loddon at Twyford and going on to Whistley Green, which is around east of Reading.

Four days later, on about 8 January, the armies met again in the Battle of Ashdown. The location of the battle is unknown, but may be Kingstanding Hill, north-west of Reading. According to Asser&#x27;s account, the Vikings arrived first at the battle ground and deployed along the top of the ridge, giving them the advantage. They divided their forces into two contingents, one under their two kings and the other under their earls. When the West Saxons saw this, they decided to copy the formation, with Æthelred facing the kings and Alfred the earls. The king then retired to his tent to hear Mass, while Alfred led his forces to the battlefield. Both sides formed their forces into shield walls. Æthelred would not cut short his devotions and Alfred risked being outflanked and overwhelmed by the whole Danish army. He decided to attack and led his men in a charge. Battle then raged around a small thorn tree and finally the West Saxons were victorious. Although Asser emphasises Alfred&#x27;s role in the victory and implies that Æthelred was dilatory, in the view of the military historian John Peddie, Æthelred was militarily correct to delay joining the battle until the situation was in his favour. The Vikings suffered heavy losses, including King Bagsecg and five earls, Sidroc the Old, Sidroc the Younger, Osbern, Fræna and Harold. The West Saxons followed the Viking flight until nightfall, cutting them down. The historian Barbara Yorke, who sees Asser&#x27;s biography as intended to portray Alfred as an ideal king, comments that &quot;Asser is particularly careful to give much credit to Alfred&quot;.

However, the victory was short-lived. Two weeks later, Æthelred and Alfred were defeated at the royal estate of Basing in the Battle of Basing. There was then a lull of two months until the West Saxons and the Vikings met at an unknown location called Meretun. In the battle on 22 March the Vikings again divided into two divisions and the West Saxons had the advantage for much of the day, putting both divisions to flight, but the Vikings regrouped and finally held control of the battlefield. The West Saxons lost many important men, including Heahmund, the Bishop of Sherborne.

=== Coinage ===

In the late eighth and ninth centuries, the only denomination of coin produced in southern England was the silver penny. As of 2007, 152 coins of Æthelred struck by 32 different moneyers have been recorded. His reign is described by the numismatists Adrian Lyons and William Mackay as &quot;a critical point in the development of the English coinage&quot;. His first Four Line issue was stylistically similar to the Floriate Cross penny of his predecessor, Æthelberht, but he soon abandoned this and adopted the design of his Mercian brother-in-law, Burgred, resulting in a common coinage design across southern England for the first time. The historian and numismatist Rory Naismith comments that Æthelred:

took the important step of adopting a new coin-type based not on local tradition, but on the Lunettes-type current in contemporary Mercia. The year 865 thus saw not only the arrival of the Viking great army that would dismantle most of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, but also the beginning of the end for separate coinages in separate kingdoms.

Lyons and Mackay see the change as even more crucial:

The developments of the late 860s can thus be viewed as an essential precursor that eventually led to the unified reform coinage of Edgar. This convergence of the coinage is also tangible evidence for a growing collaboration between Mercia and Wessex which foreshadowed the eventual creation of a unified England.

The single coinage design created a form of monetary union in southern England, reinforcing the mingling of economic interests between the two kingdoms and the military alliance against the Vikings. Coin hoards in Wessex dating to the earlier period of separate coinage designs have few non-Wessex coins, but after the adoption of the common Lunettes design, coins of Wessex and Mercia were used in both kingdoms, and even in Wessex hoards coins of Æthelred I form a minor proportion of the total. Between one and one and a half million Æthelred I Regular Lunette coins were produced, but this seems to have been significantly less than in Mercia. It is not known why the Mercian design was adopted, but it probably reflects the fact that the Lunette type had already been used for more than twelve years, the simplicity of the design, which could easily be copied, and the greater strength of the Mercian economy. The bulk of surviving Æthelred I coins are of the Regular Lunettes design, with 118 coins struck by 21 moneyers, six of whom are known to have also worked for Burgred; the coins are notable for consistency in design and good quality of execution, and they were mainly produced by Canterbury moneyers, with a few in the Mercian town of London. Only one coin is known which was produced in Wessex itself. There were also Irregular Lunettes issues, one of which was a degraded and crude variant, perhaps a result of a breakdown in controls at the end of Æthelred&#x27;s reign, when Wessex was under the pressure of Viking attacks. Alfred kept the Lunettes design for a short period following his accession in 871, but the design disappears from hoards deposited after around 875.

== Death and aftermath ==
Shortly after Easter 871, which fell on 15 April in that year, Æthelred died. According to Asser, he &quot;went the way of all flesh, having vigorously and honourably ruled the kingdom in good repute, amid many difficulties, for five years&quot;. He was buried at the royal minster at Wimborne in Dorset, which had been founded by Saint Cuthburh, a sister of his ancestor, Ingild. While Alfred was attending his funeral, the West Saxons suffered another defeat at Reading, and Alfred himself was then defeated at Wilton. He was forced to buy off the Vikings, who then withdrew to London. In 876, the Vikings returned, and Alfred fought a guerrilla war until he won a decisive victory at the Battle of Edington in 878.

Æthelred had two sons, and if he had lived until they were adults it is unlikely that Alfred would ever have become king, but as they were still young children, Alfred succeeded. Æthelhelm died before Alfred, and Æthelwold unsuccessfully disputed the throne with Edward the Elder after Alfred&#x27;s death in 899. One of the two places where Æthelwold launched his rebellion was Wimborne, which was symbolically important as his father&#x27;s burial place. Æthelred&#x27;s descendants played an important role in governing the country in the late tenth and early eleventh centuries. They include Ealdorman Æthelweard, who recorded in his Latin version of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; that he was Æthelred&#x27;s great-great-grandson. King Eadwig was forced to accept annulment of his marriage to Ælfgifu due to consanguinity; she may have been Æthelweard&#x27;s sister, which would make her Eadwig&#x27;s third cousin once removed due to her descent from Æthelred, and thus within the forbidden degrees of relationship according to the church. Æthelweard and his son Æthelmær were leading magnates who governed west Wessex as ealdormen of the western provinces. The family lost their positions and property after Cnut conquered England in 1016, and one of Æthelmær&#x27;s sons was executed by Cnut in 1017, while a son-in-law was banished in 1020. Another son, Æthelnoth, was Archbishop of Canterbury, and he lived until 1038.

<text>Fionn mac Cumhaill ( ; ; Scottish Gaelic: ; Old and or &quot;mac Cumail&quot; or &quot;mac Umaill&quot;), often anglicized Finn McCool or MacCool, is a hero in Irish mythology, as well as in later Scottish and Manx folklore. He is the leader of the &quot;Fianna&quot; bands of young roving hunter-warriors, as well as being a seer and poet. He is said to have a magic thumb that bestows him with great wisdom. He is often depicted hunting with his hounds Bran and Sceólang, and fighting with his spear and sword. The tales of Fionn and his &quot;fiann&quot; form the Fianna Cycle or Fenian Cycle (&quot;an Fhiannaíocht&quot;), much of it narrated by Fionn&#x27;s son, the poet Oisín.

==Etymology==
In Old Irish, finn/find means &quot;white, bright, lustrous; fair, light-hued (of complexion, hair, etc.); fair, handsome, bright, blessed; in moral sense, fair, just, true&quot;. It is cognate with Primitive Irish &quot;VENDO-&quot; (found in names from Ogam inscriptions), Welsh &quot;gwyn&quot; (cf. Gwyn ap Nudd), Cornish &quot;gwen&quot;, Breton &quot;gwenn&quot;, Continental Celtic and Common Brittonic &quot;*-&quot; (a common element in personal and place names), and comes from the Proto-Celtic adjective masculine singular &quot;*windos&quot;.

==Irish legend==
Fionn&#x27;s birth and early adventures are recounted in the narrative &quot;The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn&quot; and other sources. Fionn was the posthumous son of Cumhall, leader of the Fianna, by Muirne.

Fionn and his father Cumhall mac Trénmhoir (&quot;son of Trénmór&quot;) stem from Leinster, rooted in the tribe of Uí Thairsig (&quot;the Descendants of Tairsiu&quot;) There is mention of the Uí Thairsig in the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; as one of the three tribes descended from the Fir Bolg.

His mother was called Muirne Muincháem &quot;of the Fair Neck&quot; (or &quot;of the Lovely Neck&quot;, or &quot;Muiren smooth-neck&quot;), the daughter of Tadg mac Nuadat (in &quot;Fotha Catha Chnucha&quot;) and granddaughter of Nuadat the druid serving Cathair Mór who was high-king at the time, though she is described as granddaughter of Núadu of the Tuatha Dé Danann according to another source (&quot;Acallam na Senórach&quot;). Cumhall served Conn Cétchathach &quot;of the Hundred Battles&quot; who was still a regional king at Cenandos (Kells, Co. Meath).

Cumhall abducted Muirne after her father refused him her hand, so Tadg appealed to the high king Conn, who outlawed Cumhall. The Battle of Cnucha was fought between Conn and Cumhall, and Cumhall was killed by Goll mac Morna, who took over leadership of the Fianna.

===The feud===
The Fianna were a band of warriors also known as a military order composed mainly of the members of two rival clans, &quot;Clan Bascna&quot; (to which Fionn and Cumall belonged) and &quot;Clan Morna&quot; (where Goll mac Morna belonged), the Fenians were supposed to be devoted to the service of the High King and to the repelling of foreign invaders. After the fall of Cumall, Goll mac Morna replaced him as the leader of the Fianna, holding the position for 10 years.

===Birth===
Muirne was already pregnant; her father rejected her and ordered his people to burn her, but Conn would not allow it and put her under the protection of Fiacal mac Conchinn, whose wife, Bodhmall the druid, was Cumhall&#x27;s sister. In Fiacal&#x27;s house Muirne gave birth to a son, whom she called Deimne ( , ), literally &quot;sureness&quot; or &quot;certainty&quot;, also a name that means a young male deer; several legends tell how he gained the name Fionn when his hair turned prematurely white.

===Boyhood===
Fionn and his brother Tulcha mac Cumhal were being hunted down by the Goll, the sons of Morna, and other men. Consequently, Finn was separated from his mother Muirne, and placed in the care of Bodhmall and the woman Liath Luachra (&quot;Grey of Luachra&quot;), and they brought him up in secret in the forest of Sliabh Bladma, teaching him the arts of war and hunting. After the age of six, Finn learned to hunt, but still had cause to flee from the sons of Morna.

As he grew older he entered the service – incognito – of a number of local kings, but each one, when he recognised Fionn as Cumhal&#x27;s son, told him to leave, fearing they would be unable to protect him from his enemies.

==== Thumb of Knowledge ====
Fionn was a keen hunter and often hunted with Na Fianna on the hill of Allen in County Kildare, it is believed by many in the area that Fionn originally caught the Salmon of Knowledge in the River Slate that flows through Ballyteague. The secret to his success thereafter when catching &quot;fish of knowledge&quot; was to always cast from the Ballyteague side of a river. He gained what commentators have called the &quot;Thumb of Knowledge&quot; after eating a certain salmon, thought to be the Salmon of Wisdom. The account of this is given in &quot;The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn&quot;.

Young Fionn, still known by his boyhood name Demne, met the poet Finn Éces (Finnegas), near the river Boyne and studied under him. Finnegas had spent seven years trying to catch the salmon that lived in Fec&#x27;s Pool () of the Boyne, for it was prophesied the poet would eat this salmon, and &quot;nothing would remain unknown to him&quot;. Although this salmon is not specifically called the &quot;Salmon of Knowledge&quot;, etc., in the text, it is presumed to be so, i.e., the salmon that fed on the of knowledge at the well of Segais. Eventually the poet caught it, and told the boy to cook it for him. While he was cooking it, Demne burned his thumb, and instinctively put his thumb in his mouth. This imbued him with the salmon&#x27;s wisdom, and when Éces saw that he had gained wisdom, he gave the youngster the whole salmon to eat, and gave Demne the new name, Fionn.

Thereafter, whenever he recited the &quot;teinm láida&quot; with his thumb in his mouth, the knowledge he wished to gain was revealed to him.

In subsequent events in his life, Fionn was able to call on ability of the &quot;Thumb of Knowledge&quot;, and Fionn then knew how to gain revenge against Goll. In the &quot;Acallam na Sénorach&quot;, the ability is referred to as &quot;The Tooth of Wisdom&quot; or &quot;Tooth of Knowledge&quot; ().

Fionn&#x27;s acquisition of the Thumb of Knowledge has been likened to the Welsh Gwion Bach tasting the Cauldron of Knowledge, and Sigurðr Fáfnisbani tasting Fáfnir&#x27;s heart.

==== Fire-breather of the Tuatha de Danann ====

One feat of Fionn performed at 10 years of age according to the &quot;Acallam na Senórach&quot; was to slay Áillen (or ), the fire-breathing man of the Tuatha Dé Danann, who had come to wreak destruction on the Irish capital of Tara every year on the festival of Samhain for the past 23 years, lulling the city&#x27;s men to sleep with his music then burning down the city and its treasures.

When the King of Ireland asked what men would guard Tara against Áillen&#x27;s invasion, Fionn volunteered. Fionn obtained a special spear (the &quot;Birga&quot;) from Fiacha mac Congha (&quot;son of Conga&quot;), which warded against the sleep-inducing music of Áillen&#x27;s &quot;dulcimer&quot; () when it was unsheathed and the bare steel blade was touched against the forehead or some other part of the body. This Fiacha used to be one of Cumall&#x27;s men, but was now serving the high-king.

After Fionn defeated Áillen and saved Tara, his heritage was recognised and he was given command of the Fianna: Goll stepped aside, and became a loyal follower of Fionn, although a dispute later broke out between the clans over the pig of Slanga.

==== Almu as eric ====

Before Fionn completed the feat of defeating the firebrand of the fairy mound and defending Tara, he is described as a ten-year-old &quot;marauder and an outlaw&quot;. It is also stated elsewhere that when Fionn grew up to become &quot;capable of committing plunder on everyone who was an enemy&quot;, he went to his maternal grandfather Tadg to demand compensation (éric) for his father&#x27;s death, on pain of single combat, and Tadg acceded by relinquishing the estate of Almu (the present-day Hill of Allen). Fionn was also paid éric by Goll mac Morna.

== Adulthood ==
Fionn&#x27;s sword was called &quot;Mac an Luinn&quot;.

===Love life===
Fionn met his most famous wife, Sadhbh, when he was out hunting. She had been turned into a deer by a druid, Fear Doirich, whom she had refused to marry. Fionn&#x27;s hounds, Bran and Sceólang, born of a human enchanted into the form of a hound, recognised her as human, and Fionn brought her home. She transformed back into a woman the moment she set foot on Fionn&#x27;s land, as this was the one place she could regain her true form. She and Fionn married and she was soon pregnant. When Fionn was away defending his country, Fear Doirich (literally meaning Dark Man) returned and turned her back into a deer, whereupon she vanished. Fionn spent years searching for her, but to no avail. Bran and Sceólang, again hunting, found her son, Oisín, in the form of a fawn; he transformed into a child, and went on to be one of the greatest of the Fianna.

In &quot;The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gráinne&quot; the High King Cormac mac Airt promises the aging Fionn his daughter Gráinne, but at the wedding feast Gráinne falls for one of the Fianna, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, noted for his beauty. She forces him to run away with her and Fionn pursues them. The lovers are helped by the Fianna, and by Diarmuid&#x27;s foster-father, the god Aengus. Eventually Fionn makes his peace with the couple. Years later, however, Fionn invites Diarmuid on a boar hunt, and Diarmuid is gored. Water drunk from Fionn&#x27;s hands has the power of healing, but each time Fionn gathers water he lets it run through his fingers before he gets back to Diarmuid. His grandson Oscar shames Fionn, but when he finally returns with water it is too late; Diarmuid has died.

===Death===
According to the most popular account of Fionn&#x27;s death, he is not dead at all, rather, he sleeps in a cave, surrounded by the Fianna. One day he will awake and defend Ireland in the hour of her greatest need. In one account, it is said that he will arise when the Dord Fiann, the hunting horn of the Fianna, is sounded three times, and he will be as strong and as well as he ever was.

==Popular folklore==

Many geographical features in Ireland are attributed to Fionn. Legend has it he built the Giant&#x27;s Causeway as stepping-stones to Scotland, so as not to get his feet wet; he also once scooped up part of Ireland to fling it at a rival, but it missed and landed in the Irish Sea – the clump became the Isle of Man, the pebble became Rockall, and the void became Lough Neagh. In Ayrshire, Scotland a common myth is that Ailsa Craig, a small islet just off coast of the said county, is another rock thrown at the fleeing Benandonner. The islet is sometimes referred to as &quot;paddys&#x27; mile stone&quot; in Ayrshire. Fingal&#x27;s Cave in Scotland is also named after him, and shares the feature of hexagonal basalt columns with the nearby Giant&#x27;s Causeway in Northern Ireland.

In both Irish and Manx popular folklore, Fionn mac Cumhail (known as &quot;Finn McCool&quot; or &quot;Finn MacCooill&quot; respectively) is portrayed as a magical, benevolent giant. The most famous story attached to this version of Fionn tells of how one day, while making a pathway in the sea towards Scotland – The Giant&#x27;s Causeway – Fionn is told that the giant Benandonner (or, in the Manx version, a buggane) is coming to fight him. Knowing he cannot withstand the colossal Benandonner, Fionn asks his wife Oona to help him. She dresses her husband as a baby, and he hides in a cradle; then she makes a batch of griddle-cakes, hiding griddle-irons in some. When Benandonner arrives, Oona tells him Fionn is out but will be back shortly. As Benandonner waits, he tries to intimidate Oona with his immense power, breaking rocks with his little finger. Oona then offers Benandonner a griddle-cake, but when he bites into the iron he chips his teeth. Oona scolds him for being weak (saying her husband eats such cakes easily), and feeds one without an iron to the &#x27;baby&#x27;, who eats it without trouble.

In the Irish version, Benandonner is so awed by the power of the baby&#x27;s teeth and the size of the baby that, at Oona&#x27;s prompting, he puts his fingers in Fionn&#x27;s mouth to feel how sharp his teeth are. Fionn bites Benandonner&#x27;s little finger, and scared of the prospect of meeting his father considering the baby&#x27;s size, Benandonner runs back towards Scotland across the Causeway smashing the causeway so Fionn can&#x27;t follow him.

The Manx Gaelic version contains a further tale of how Fionn and the buggane fought at Kirk Christ Rushen. One of Fionn&#x27;s feet carved out the channel between the Calf of Man and Kitterland, the other carved out the channel between Kitterland and the Isle of Man, and the buggane&#x27;s feet opened up Port Erin. The buggane injured Fionn, who fled over the sea (where the buggane could not follow), however, the buggane tore out one of his own teeth and struck Fionn as he ran away. The tooth fell into the sea, becoming the Chicken Rock, and Fionn cursed the tooth, explaining why it is a hazard to sailors.

In Newfoundland, and some parts of Nova Scotia, &quot;Fingal&#x27;s Rising&quot; is spoken of in a distinct nationalistic sense. Made popular in songs and bars alike, to speak of &quot;Fingle,&quot; as his name is pronounced in English versus &quot;Fion MaCool&quot; in Newfoundland Irish, is sometimes used as a stand-in for Newfoundland or its culture.

Folktales involving hero Fin MacCool are considered to be classified in Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as ATU 369, &quot;The Youth on a Quest for his lost Father&quot;, a tale type that, however, some see as exclusive to South Asian tradition, namely India.

== Historical hypothesis ==

The 17th-century historian Geoffrey Keating, and some Irish scholars of the 19th century, believed that Fionn was based on a historical figure.

The 19th century scholar Heinrich Zimmer suggested that Fionn and the Fenian Cycle came from the heritage of the Norse-Gaels. He suggested the name &quot;Fianna&quot; was an Irish rendering of Old Norse &quot;fiandr&quot; &quot;enemies&quot; &gt; &quot;brave enemies&quot; &gt; &quot;brave warriors&quot;. He also noted the tale of Fionn&#x27;s Thumb of Knowledge is similar to the Norse tale of Sigurðr and Fáfnir, although similar tales are found in other cultures. Zimmer proposed that Fionn might be based on Caittil Find (d. 856) a Norseman based in Munster, who had a Norse forename (&quot;Ketill&quot;) and an Irish nickname (&quot;Find&quot;, &quot;the Fair&quot; or &quot;the White&quot;). But Ketill&#x27;s father must have had some Norse name also, certainly not Cumall, and the proposal was thus rejected by George Henderson.

=== Toponymy ===
Fionn Mac Cumhaill was said to be originally from Ballyfin, in Laois. The direct translation of Ballyfin from Irish to English is &quot;town of Fionn&quot;.

== Retellings ==

T. W. Rolleston compiled both Fenian and Ultonian cycle literature in his retelling, &quot;The High Deeds of Finn and other Bardic Romances of Ancient Ireland&quot; (1910).

James Stephens published &quot;Irish Fairy Tales&quot; (1920), which is a retelling of a few of the Fiannaíocht.

==Modern literature==
===Macpherson&#x27;s Ossian===
Fionn MacCumhail was transformed into the character &quot;Fingal&quot; in James Macpherson&#x27;s poem cycle &quot;Ossian&quot; (1760), which Macpherson claimed was translated out of discovered Ossianic poetry written in the Scottish Gaelic language. &quot;Fingal&quot;, derived from the Gaelic &quot;Fionnghall&quot;, was possibly Macpherson&#x27;s rendering Fionn&#x27;s name as &quot;Fingal&quot; based on a misapprehension of the various forms of &quot;Fionn&quot;. His poems had widespread influence on writers, from the young Walter Scott to Goethe, but there was controversy from the outset about Macpherson&#x27;s claims to have translated the works from ancient sources. The authenticity of the poems is now generally doubted, though they may have been based on fragments of Gaelic legend, 

===Twentieth century literature===
Fionn mac Cumhaill features heavily in modern Irish literature. Most notably he makes several appearances in James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; (1939) and some have posited that the title, taken from the street ballad &quot;Finnegan&#x27;s Wake&quot;, may also be a blend of &quot;Finn again is awake&quot;, referring to his eventual awakening to defend Ireland.

Fionn also appears as a character in Flann O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s comic novel, &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot; (1939), in passages that parody the style of Irish myths. Morgan Llywelyn&#x27;s book &quot;Finn Mac Cool&quot; (1994) tells of Fionn&#x27;s rise to leader of the Fianna and the love stories that ensue in his life. That character is celebrated in &quot;The Legend of Finn MacCumhail&quot;, a song by the Boston-based band Dropkick Murphys featured on their album &quot;Sing Loud Sing Proud!&quot;.

&quot;Glencoe: The Story of the Massacre&quot; by John Prebble (Secker &amp; Warburg, 1966), has an account of a legendary battle between Fionn mac Cumhaill, who supposedly lived for a time in Glencoe (in Scotland), and a Viking host in forty longships which sailed up the narrows by Ballachulish into Loch Leven. The Norsemen were defeated by the Feinn of the valley of Glencoe, and their chief Earragan was slain by Goll MacMorna.

&quot;The High Deeds of Finn MacCool&quot;, an evocative children&#x27;s novel by Rosemary Sutcliffe, was published in 1969.

&quot;Finn Mac Cool&quot; written by American author, Morgan Llywelyn, was released in 1994. The fictional novel vividly recounts Finn&#x27;s historical adventures saturated with myth and magic. A childhood spent in exile, the love and loss of his beloved wife and child, and his legendary rise from a low class slave to leader of the invincible Fianna.

Finn McCool is a character in Terry Pratchett&#x27;s and Steve Baxter&#x27;s &quot;The Long War&quot;.

The adventures of Fion Mac Cumhail after death is explored by the novella &quot;The Final Fighting of Fion Mac Cumhail&quot; by Randall Garrett (Fantasy and Science Fiction – September 1975).

Finn&#x27;s early childhood and education is explored in &quot; &#x27;Tis Himself: The Tale of Finn MacCool&quot; by Maggie Brace.

Other stories featuring Fionn Mac Cumhail are two of three of the stories in The Corliss Chronicles the story of Prudence Corliss. In the stories, he is featured in The Wraith of Bedlam and The Silver Wheel. He is a close confidant to Prudence and allies himself with her to defeat the evil fictional king Tarcarrius.

== Plays and shows ==

In 1987 Harvey Holton (1949–2010) published &quot;Finn&quot; with the Three Tygers Press, Cambridge. This was a dramatic cycle of poems in Scots for the stage and with music by Hamish Moore, based on the legends of Finn McCool and first performed at The Edinburgh Festival in 1986 before going on tour around Scotland.

In the 1999 Irish dance show Dancing on Dangerous Ground, conceived and choreographed by former Riverdance leads, Jean Butler and Colin Dunne, Tony Kemp portrayed Fionn in a modernised version of &quot;The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gráinne&quot;. In this, Diarmuid, played by Colin Dunne, dies at the hands of the Fianna after he and Gráinne, played by Jean Butler, run away together into the forests of Ireland, immediately after Fionn and Gráinne&#x27;s wedding. When she sees Diarmuid&#x27;s body, Gráinne dies of a broken heart.

In 2010, Washington DC&#x27;s Dizzie Miss Lizzie&#x27;s Roadside Revue debuted their rock musical &quot;Finn McCool&quot; at the Capitol Fringe Festival. The show retells the legend of Fionn mac Cumhaill through punk-inspired rock and was performed at the Woolly Mammoth Theater in March 2011.

<doc id="47372" wikidata="Q71231" url="?curid=47372" title="Charles the Bald">
<text>Charles the Bald (; 13 June 823 – 6 October 877), also known as CharlesII, was a 9th-century king of West Francia (843–877), King of Italy (875–877) and emperor of the Carolingian Empire (875–877). After a series of civil wars during the reign of his father, Louis the Pious, Charles succeeded, by the Treaty of Verdun (843), in acquiring the western third of the empire. He was a grandson of Charlemagne and the youngest son of Louis the Pious by his second wife, Judith.

==Struggle against his brothers==
He was born on 13 June 823 in Frankfurt, when his elder brothers were already adults and had been assigned their own &quot;regna&quot;, or subkingdoms, by their father. The attempts made by Louis the Pious to assign Charles a subkingdom, first Alemannia and then the country between the Meuse and the Pyrenees (in 832, after the rising of PepinI of Aquitaine) were unsuccessful. The numerous reconciliations with the rebellious Lothair and Pepin, as well as their brother Louis the German, King of Bavaria, made Charles&#x27;s share in Aquitaine and Italy only temporary, but his father did not give up and made Charles the heir of the entire land which was once Gaul. At a diet in Aachen in 837, Louis the Pious bade the nobles do homage to Charles as his heir. Pepin of Aquitaine died in 838, whereupon Charles at last received that kingdom, which angered Pepin&#x27;s heirs and the Aquitainian nobles.

The death of the emperor in 840 led to the outbreak of war between his sons. Charles allied himself with his brother Louis the German to resist the pretensions of the new Emperor LothairI, and the two allies defeated Lothair at the Battle of Fontenoy-en-Puisaye on 25 June 841. In the following year, the two brothers confirmed their alliance by the celebrated Oaths of Strasbourg. The war was brought to an end by the Treaty of Verdun in August 843. The settlement gave Charles the Bald the kingdom of the West Franks, which he had been governing until then, and which practically corresponded with what is now France, as far as the Meuse, the Saône, and the Rhône, with the addition of the Spanish March as far as the Ebro. Louis received the eastern part of the Carolingian Empire, known then as East Francia and later as Germany. Lothair retained the imperial title and the Kingdom of Italy. He also received the central regions from Flanders through the Rhineland and Burgundy as king of Middle Francia.

==Reign in the West==


Shortly after Verdun, Charles went on to an unsuccessful campaign against Brittany, on the return from which he signed the Treaty of Coulaines with his nobility and clergy. After that, the first years of his reign, up to the death of LothairI in 855, were comparatively peaceful. During these years the three brothers continued the system of &quot;confraternal government&quot;, meeting repeatedly with one another, at Koblenz (848), at Meerssen (851), and at Attigny (854). In 858, Louis the German, invited by disaffected nobles eager to oust Charles, invaded the West Frankish kingdom. Charles was so unpopular that he was unable to summon an army, and he fled to Burgundy. He was saved only by the support of the bishops, who refused to crown Louis the German king, and by the fidelity of the Welfs, who were related to his mother, Judith. In 860, he in his turn tried to seize the kingdom of his nephew, Charles of Provence, but was repulsed. On the death of his nephew LothairII in 869, Charles tried to seize Lothair&#x27;s dominions by having himself consecrated as King of Lotharingia at Metz, but he was compelled to open negotiations when Louis found support among Lothair&#x27;s former vassals. Lotharingia was partitioned between Charles and Louis in the resulting treaty (870).

Besides these family disputes, Charles had to struggle against repeated rebellions in Aquitaine and against the Bretons. Led by their chiefs Nomenoë and Erispoë, who defeated the king at the Battle of Ballon (845) and the Battle of Jengland (851), the Bretons were successful in obtaining a &quot;de facto&quot; independence. Charles also fought against the Vikings, who devastated the country of the north, the valleys of the Seine and Loire, and even up to the borders of Aquitaine. At the Vikings&#x27; successful siege and sack of Paris in 845 and several times thereafter Charles was forced to purchase their retreat at a heavy price. Charles led various expeditions against the invaders and, by the Edict of Pistres of 864, made the army more mobile by providing for a cavalry element, the predecessor of the French chivalry so famous during the next 600 years. By the same edict, he ordered fortified bridges to be put up at all rivers to block the Viking incursions. Two of these bridges at Paris saved the city during its siege of 885–886. Charles engaged in diplomacy with the Emirate of Cordoba, receiving camels from Emir MuhammadI in 865. From the 860s, the palace of Compiègne became an increasingly important centre for Charles and he founded a monastery there in 876. In the tenth century Compiègne was known as &#x27;Carlopolis&#x27; because of its association with Charles.

In 871–872, Charles sent two letters to Pope HadrianII where he made a defence of royal sovereignty in the face of intrusive actions by the papacy into state affairs.

==Reign as emperor==

In 875, after the death of the Emperor LouisII (son of his half-brother Lothair), Charles the Bald, supported by Pope JohnVIII, traveled to Italy, receiving the royal crown at Pavia and the imperial insignia in Rome on 25 December. As emperor, Charles combined the mottoes that had been used by his grandfather and father into a single formula: &quot;renovatio imperii Romani et Francorum&quot;, &quot;renewal of the empire of the Romans and Franks&quot;. These words appeared on his seal.

Louis the German, also a candidate for the succession of LouisII, revenged himself by invading and devastating Charles&#x27;s domains, and Charles had to return hastily to West Francia. After the death of Louis the German (28 August 876), Charles in his turn attempted to seize Louis&#x27;s kingdom, but was decisively beaten at the Battle of Andernach on 8 October 876.

In the meantime, Pope JohnVIII, menaced by the Saracens, was urging Charles to come to his defence in Italy. Charles again crossed the Alps, but this expedition was received with little enthusiasm by the nobles, and even by his regent in Lombardy, Boso, and they refused to join his army. At the same time Carloman, son of Louis the German, entered northern Italy. Charles, ill and in great distress, started on his way back to Gaul, but died while crossing the pass of Mont Cenis at Brides-les-Bains, on 6 October 877.

==Burial and succession==
According to the Annals of St-Bertin, Charles was hastily buried at the abbey of Nantua, Burgundy, because the bearers were unable to withstand the stench of his decaying body. A few years later, his remains were transferred to the Abbey of Saint-Denis where he had long wished to be buried, in a porphyry tub which may be the same one known as &quot;Dagobert&#x27;s tub&quot; (&quot;cuve de Dagobert&quot;), now in the Louvre. It was recorded that there was a memorial brass there that was melted down at the Revolution.

Charles was succeeded by his son, Louis. Charles was a prince of education and letters, a friend of the church, and conscious of the support he could find in the episcopate against his unruly nobles, for he chose his councillors from among the higher clergy, as in the case of Guenelon of Sens, who betrayed him, and of Hincmar of Reims.

==Baldness==
It has been suggested that Charles&#x27;s nickname was used ironically and not descriptively; he was not in fact bald but rather was extremely hairy.
An alternative or additional interpretation is based on Charles&#x27;s initial lack of a &quot;regnum&quot;. &quot;Bald&quot; would in this case be a tongue-in-cheek reference to his landlessness at an age at which his brothers already had been sub-kings for some years.

Contemporary depictions of his person, such as in his Bible of 845, on his seal of 847 (as king) and on his seal of 875 (as emperor), show him with a full head of hair, as does the equestrian statuette (c. 870), which is thought to depict him.

The &quot;Genealogy of Frankish Kings&quot;, a text from Fontanelle dating from possibly as early as 869, names him as &quot;Karolus Calvus&quot; (&quot;Charles the Bald&quot;),
and he is given the same name in the late tenth century by Richier of Reims and Adhemar of Chabannes.

==Marriages and children==
Charles married Ermentrude, daughter of Odo I, Count of Orléans, in 842. She died in 869. In 870, Charles married Richilde of Provence, who was descended from a noble family of Lorraine.

<text>Alberobello (; literally &quot;beautiful tree&quot;; Barese: ) is a small town and &quot;comune&quot; of the Metropolitan City of Bari, Apulia, southern Italy. It has 10,237 inhabitants (2022) and is famous for its unique &quot;trullo&quot; buildings. The &quot;trulli&quot; of Alberobello have been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1996. Alberobello is one of I Borghi più belli d&#x27;Italia (&quot;The most beautiful villages of Italy&quot;).

==History==
A first occupation of the area started only in the early sixteenth century on the impulse of the Count of Conversano Andrea Matteo III Acquaviva d&#x27;Aragona. He allowed about forty peasant families from Noci to settle here and cultivate the land, with the obligation to give him a tenth of the crops.

In 1635 his successor, Count Giangirolamo II (1600–1665) erected an inn with a tavern and an oratory and started the urbanization of the forest with the construction of few small houses. The expansion of the urban area was helped by the abundance of limestone, karst and calcareous sedimentary, and by the permission of the count to build houses only with dry walls without the use of mortar, which would become the peculiar &quot;trulli&quot;. This obligation to have houses built with dry stones was an expedient of the count to avoid paying taxes to the Spanish viceroy of the Kingdom of Naples. The centre of Alberobello was built on the streets of the ancient river Cana, where is now the largo Giuseppe Martelotta.

Alberobello remained a fief of the Acquaviva of Aragon until 27 May 1797, when King Ferdinand IV of Bourbon elevated the small village to the royal city, freeing it from the feudal servitude of the counts. On 22 June 1797, the first mayor Francesco Giuseppe Lippolis was elected.

Alberobello is the only inhabited center with an entire district of trulli, and is considered to be the cultural capital of the trulli of the Itria Valley.

== The &quot;trulli&quot; of Alberobello ==
The history of the &quot;trulli&quot; (from Ancient Greek τρούλλοι) is linked to the Prammatica De Baronibus, an edict of the 15th-century Kingdom of Naples that subjected every new settlement to a tribute. In 1481 the Counts of Conversano D&#x27;Acquaviva D&#x27;Aragona from 1481, owners of the territory of Alberobello, then imposed on the residents that they built their dwellings dry, without using mortars, so that they could be configured as precarious buildings and easily demolished.

Having to use only stones, the peasants found in the round form with self-supporting domed roof the simplest configuration. The roofs were embellished with decorative pinnacles representing the signature of the architect (&quot;master ).

==International relations==
Alberobello is twinned with:
* Shirakawa-gō, Japan
* Gokayama, Japan
* Monte Sant&#x27;Angelo, Italy, since 2013
* Andria, Italy
* Harran, Turkey, since 2013

During the Italian diaspora, a large number of Alberobellesi emigrated to Utica, New York.

<text>Chess strategy is the aspect of chess play concerned with evaluation of chess positions and setting goals and long-term plans for future play. While evaluating a position strategically, a player must take into account such factors as the relative value of the pieces on the board, pawn structure, king safety, position of pieces, and control of key squares and groups of squares (e.g. diagonals and open files). Chess strategy is distinguished from chess tactics, which is the aspect of play concerned with move-by-move threats and defenses. Some authors distinguish static strategic imbalances (e.g. having more valuable pieces or better pawn structure), which tend to persist for many moves, from dynamic imbalances (such as one player having an advantage in piece ), which are temporary. This distinction affects the immediacy with which a sought-after plan should take effect. Until players reach Master-level chess skill, chess tactics tend to ultimately decide the outcomes of games more often than strategy. Many chess coaches thus emphasize the study of tactics as the most efficient way to improve one&#x27;s results in serious chess play.

The most basic way to evaluate one&#x27;s position is to count the total value of pieces on both sides. The point values used for this purpose are based on experience. Usually pawns are considered to be worth one point, knights and bishops three points each, rooks five points, and queens nine points. The fighting value of the king in the endgame is approximately four points. These basic values are modified by other factors such as the (e.g. advanced pawns are usually more valuable than those on their starting squares), (e.g. a usually coordinates better than a bishop plus a knight), and the (knights are generally better in with many pawns, while bishops are more powerful in ).

Another important factor in the evaluation of chess positions is the pawn structure or pawn skeleton. Since pawns are the most immobile and least valuable of the pieces, the pawn structure is relatively static and largely determines the strategic nature of the position. Weaknesses in the pawn structure, such as isolated, doubled, or backward pawns and , once created, are usually permanent. Care must therefore be taken to avoid them unless they are compensated by another valuable asset, such as the possibility to develop an attack.
== Basic concepts of board evaluation ==
A advantage applies both strategically and tactically. Generally more pieces or an aggregate of more powerful pieces means greater chances of winning. A fundamental strategic and tactical rule is to capture opponent pieces while preserving one&#x27;s own.

Bishops and knights are called &quot;minor pieces&quot;. A knight is about as valuable as a bishop, but less valuable than a rook. Rooks and the queen are called &quot;major pieces&quot;. Bishops are usually considered slightly better than knights in open positions, such as toward the end of the game when many of the pieces have been captured, whereas knights have an advantage in closed positions. Having two bishops (the ) is a particularly powerful weapon, especially if the opposing player lacks one or both of their bishops.

Three pawns are likely to be more useful than a knight in the endgame, but in the middlegame, a knight is often more powerful. Two minor pieces are stronger than a single rook, and two rooks are slightly stronger than a queen. The bishop on squares of the same color as the opponent&#x27;s king is slightly more valuable in the opening as it can attack the vulnerable square f7 (for White) or f2 (for Black). A rook is more valuable when with another rook or queen; consequently, doubled rooks are worth more than two .

One commonly used simple scoring system is:

Under a system like this, giving up a knight or bishop to win a rook (&quot;winning the exchange&quot;) is advantageous and is worth about two pawns. This ignores complications such as the current position and freedom of the pieces involved, but it is a good starting point. In an open position, bishops are more valuable than knights (a bishop pair can easily be worth seven points or more in some situations); conversely, in a closed position, bishops are less valuable than knights. A knight in the center of the board that cannot be taken, however, is known as a knight outpost and threatens several fork instances. In such a case, a knight is worth far more than a bishop. Also, many pieces have a partner. By doubling up two knights, two rooks, rook and queen, or bishop and queen, the pieces can get stronger than the sum of the individual pieces alone. When a piece loses its partner, its value slightly decreases. The king is priceless since its capture results in the defeat of that player and ends that game. However, especially in the endgame, the king can also be a fighting piece, and is sometimes given a fighting value of three-and-a-half points.

=== Space ===
Other things being equal, the side that controls more on the board has an advantage. More space means more options, which can be exploited both tactically and strategically. A player who has all pieces developed and no tactical tricks or promising long-term plan should try to find a move that enlarges their influence, particularly in the center. In some openings, however, one player accepts less space for a time, to set up a counterattack in the middlegame. This is one of the concepts behind hypermodern play.

The easiest way to gain space is to push the pawn skeleton forward. One must be careful not to over stretch, however. If the opponent succeeds in getting a protected piece behind enemy lines, this piece can become such a serious problem that a piece with a higher value might have to be exchanged for it.
Larry Evans gives a method of evaluating space. The method (for each side) is to count the number of squares attacked or occupied on the opponent&#x27;s side of the board. In this diagram from the Nimzo-Indian Defense, Black attacks four squares on White&#x27;s side of the board (d4, e4, f4, and g4). White attacks seven squares on Black&#x27;s side of the board (b5, c6, e6, f5, g5, and h6 – counting b5 twice) and occupies one square (d5). White has a space advantage of eight to four and Black is cramped.

===Control of the center===

The strategy consists of placing pieces so that they attack the central four squares of the board. A piece being placed on a central square, however, does not necessarily mean it controls the center; e.g., a knight on a central square does not attack any central squares. Conversely, a piece does not have to be on a central square to control the center. For example, the bishop can control the center from afar.

Control of the center is generally considered important because tactical battles often take place around the central squares, from where pieces can access most of the board. Center control allows more movement and more possibility for attack and defense.

Chess openings try to control the center while developing pieces. Hypermodern openings are those that control the center with pieces from afar (usually the side, such as with a fianchetto); the older Classical (or Modern) openings control it with pawns.
===Initiative===
The initiative belongs to the player who can make threats that cannot be ignored, such as checking the opponent&#x27;s king. They thus put their opponent in the position of having to use their turns responding to threats rather than making their own, hindering the development of their pieces. The player with the initiative is generally attacking and the other player is generally defending.

=== Defending pieces ===
It is important to defend one&#x27;s pieces even if they are not directly threatened. This helps stop possible future campaigns from the opponent. If a defender must be added at a later time, this may cost a tempo or even be impossible due to a fork or discovered attack. The approach of always defending one&#x27;s pieces has an antecedent in the theory of Aron Nimzowitsch who referred to it as &quot;overprotection.&quot; Similarly, if one spots undefended enemy pieces, one should immediately take advantage of those pieces&#x27; weakness.

Even a defended piece can be vulnerable. If the defending piece is also defending something else, it is called an overworked piece, and may not be able to fulfill its task. When there is more than one attacking piece, the number of defenders must also be increased, and their values taken into account. In addition to defending pieces, it is also often necessary to defend key squares, open files, and the . These situations can easily occur if the pawn structure is weak.

=== Exchanging pieces ===
To exchange pieces means to capture a hostile piece and then allow a piece of the same value to be captured. As a rule of thumb, exchanging pieces eases the task of the defender who typically has less room to operate in.

Exchanging pieces is usually desirable to a player with an existing advantage in material, since it brings the endgame closer and thereby leaves the opponent with less ability to recover ground. In the endgame even a single pawn advantage may be decisive. Exchanging also benefits the player who is being attacked, the player who controls less space, and the player with the better pawn structure.

When playing against stronger players, many beginners attempt to constantly exchange pieces &quot;to simplify matters&quot;. However, stronger players are often relatively stronger in the endgame, whereas errors are more common during the more complicated middlegame.

Note that &quot;the exchange&quot; may also specifically mean a rook exchanged for a bishop or knight. The phrase &quot;up the exchange&quot; means that a player has captured a rook in exchange for a bishop or knight—a materially advantageous trade. Conversely, &quot;down the exchange&quot; means having lost a rook but captured a bishop or knight—a materially disadvantageous trade.

===Specific pieces===

==== Pawns ====
In the endgame, passed pawns, unhindered by enemy pawns from promotion, are strong, especially if advanced or protected by another pawn. A passed pawn on the sixth is roughly as strong as a knight or bishop and often decides the game. (Also see isolated pawn, doubled pawns, backward pawn, connected pawns.)

==== Knights ====

Since knights can easily be chased away by pawn moves, it is often advantageous for knights to be placed in &quot;&quot; in the enemy position as outposts—squares where they cannot be attacked by pawns. Such a knight on the fifth rank is a strong asset. The ideal position for a knight is the opponent&#x27;s third rank, when it is supported by one or two pawns. A knight at the edge or corner of the board controls fewer squares than one on the board&#x27;s interior, thus the saying &quot;A knight on the rim is dim!&quot;

A king and one knight are not sufficient material to checkmate an opposing lone king (see Two knights endgame). A king and two knights can checkmate a lone king but cannot force it.

==== Bishops ====

In general, bishops and knights are of roughly equal value. When bishops are blocked in by pawns, as seen in closed positions, knights are typically superior for their ability to hop over pawn chains. In open positions where bishops have good , knights are often inferior— knights are a common exception.

Bishops have superior mobility to knights, but that mobility is restricted to (and thus focused on) colors of a single square. As a result, lacking a bishop weakens one&#x27;s ability to exert control over and parry threats from the deprived color complex, though there may be compensation in the form of tactical or positional assets, or from possible countermeasures, such as placing one&#x27;s pawns on the color of the lost bishop. Bishops complement each other well, and a retained is often a strength, especially in open positions.

&quot;Fianchettoed&quot; bishops can keep a king under them well defended, though if the bishop is traded off, the fianchetto pawn structure is especially vulnerable to infiltration on the squares no longer controlled by the bishop.

Despite their openness, in endgames, bishops are usually considered equal to knights. Endgames in which the two sides have bishops on opposite colors are frequently drawish, even when one side has one or two more pawns than the other.

A king and a bishop are not sufficient material to checkmate an opposing lone king, but two bishops and a king can checkmate an opposing lone king easily. A king, bishop, and knight can also force mate; this is considered the most difficult forcible checkmate against a lone king.

==== Rooks ====

Rooks have more scope of movement on half-open files (ones with no pawns of one&#x27;s own color). Rooks on the seventh rank can be very powerful as they attack pawns that can only be defended by other pieces, and they can restrict the enemy king to its back rank. A pair of rooks on the player&#x27;s seventh rank are often a sign of a winning position.

In middlegames and endgames with a passed pawn, Tarrasch&#x27;s rule states that rooks, both friend and foe of the pawn, are usually strongest the pawn rather than in front of it.

A king and a rook are sufficient material to checkmate an opposing lone king, although it&#x27;s a little harder than checkmating with king and queen; thus the rook&#x27;s distinction as a major piece above the knight and bishop.

==== Queen ====
Queens are the most powerful pieces. They have great mobility and can make many threats at once. They can act as a rook and as a bishop at the same time. For these reasons, checkmate attacks involving a queen are easier to achieve than those without one. Although powerful, the queen is also easily harassed. Thus, it is generally wise to wait to the queen until after the knights and bishops have been developed to prevent the queen from being attacked by minor pieces and losing tempo. When a pawn is promoted, most of the time it is promoted to a queen.

==== King ====

During the middlegame, the king is often best protected in a corner behind its pawns. Such a position for either of the players is often achieved by castling by that player. If the rooks and queen leave the first rank (commonly called that player&#x27;s &quot;back rank&quot;), however, an enemy rook or queen can checkmate the king by invading the first rank, commonly called a back-rank checkmate. Moving one of the pawns in front of the king (making a luft) can allow it an escape square, but may weaken the king&#x27;s overall safety otherwise. One must therefore wisely balance between these trade-offs.

Castling is often thought to help protect the king and often &quot;connects&quot; the player&#x27;s two rooks together so the two rooks may protect each other. This can reduce a threat of a back-rank skewer in which the king can be skewered with capture of a rook behind it.

The king can become a strong piece in the endgame. With reduced material, a quick checkmate becomes less of a concern, and moving the king towards the center of the board gives it more opportunities to make threats and actively influence play.

== Considerations ==

Chess strategy consists of setting and achieving long-term goals during the game—for example, where to place different pieces—while tactics concentrate on immediate maneuver. These two parts of chess thinking cannot be completely separated, because strategic goals are mostly achieved by the means of tactics, while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of play.

Because of different strategic and tactical patterns, a game of chess is usually divided into three distinct phases: the opening, usually the first 10 to 25 moves, when players develop their armies and set up the stage for the coming battle; the middlegame, the developed phase of the game; and the endgame, when most of the pieces are gone and kings start to take an active part in the struggle.

=== Opening ===
A chess opening is the group of initial moves of a game (the &quot;opening moves&quot;). Recognized sequences of opening moves are referred to as &quot;openings&quot; and have been given names such as the Ruy Lopez or Sicilian Defence. They are catalogued in reference works such as the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings&quot;.

There are dozens of different openings, varying widely in character from quiet positional play (e.g. the Réti Opening) to very aggressive play (e.g. the Latvian Gambit). In some opening lines, the exact sequence considered best for both sides has been worked out to 30–35 moves or more. Professional players spend years studying openings, and continue doing so throughout their careers, as opening theory continues to evolve.

The fundamental strategic aims of most openings are similar:
*&quot;Development:&quot; To place (develop) the pieces (particularly bishops and knights) on useful squares where they influence the game.
*&quot;Control of the :&quot; Control of the central squares allows pieces to be moved to any part of the board relatively easily, and can also have a cramping effect on the opponent.
*&quot;King safety:&quot; Correct timing of castling can enhance this.
*&quot;Pawn structure:&quot; Players strive to avoid the creation of pawn weaknesses such as isolated, doubled or backward pawns, and .

During the opening, some pieces have a recognized optimum square they try to reach. Hence, an optimum deployment could be to push the king and queen pawn two squares, followed by moving the knights so they protect the center pawns and give additional control of the center. One can then deploy the bishops, protected by the knights, to pin the opponent&#x27;s knights and pawns. An opening may end with castling, which moves the king to safety, creates a stronger , and puts a rook on a .

Apart from these fundamentals, other strategic plans or tactical sequences may be employed in the opening.

Most players and theoreticians consider that White, by virtue of the first move, begins the game with a small advantage. Black usually strives to neutralize White&#x27;s advantage and achieve , or to develop in an unbalanced position.

=== Middlegame ===
The middlegame is the part of the game when most pieces have been developed. Because the opening theory has ended, players have to assess the position to form plans based on the features of the positions, and at the same time take into account the tactical possibilities in the position.

Typical plans or strategic themes—for example the , that is the attack of pawns against an opponent who has more pawns on the queenside—are often appropriate just for some pawn structures, resulting from a specific group of openings. The study of openings should therefore be connected with the preparation of plans typical for resulting middlegames.

The middlegame is also the phase when most combinations occur. Middlegame combinations are often connected with the attack against the opponent&#x27;s king; some typical patterns have their own names, for example the Boden&#x27;s Mate or the Lasker–Bauer combination.

Another important strategical question in the middlegame is whether and how to reduce material and transform into an endgame (i.e. ). For example, minor material advantages can generally be transformed into victory only in an endgame, and therefore the stronger side must choose an appropriate way to achieve an ending. Not every reduction of material is good for this purpose; for example, if one side keeps a light-squared bishop and the opponent has a dark-squared one, the transformation into a &quot;bishops and pawns ending&quot; is usually advantageous for the weaker side only, because an endgame with bishops on opposite colors is likely to be a draw, even with an advantage of one or two pawns.

=== Endgame ===


The endgame (or &quot;end game&quot; or &quot;ending&quot;) is the stage of the game when there are few pieces left on the board. There are three main strategic differences between earlier stages of the game and the endgame:
*During the endgame, pawns become more important; endgames often revolve around attempting to promote a pawn by advancing it to the eighth rank.
*The king, which must be protected in the middlegame owing to the threat of checkmate, becomes a strong piece in the endgame and it is often brought to the center of the board where it can protect its own pawns, attack the pawns of opposite color, and hinder movement of the opponent&#x27;s king.
*Zugzwang, a disadvantage because the player must make a move, is often a factor in endgames and rarely in other stages of the game. For example, in the adjacent diagram, Black on move must play 1...Kb7 and allow white to after 2.Kd7, while White on move must allow a draw either after 1.Kc6 stalemate or losing the last pawn by moving anywhere else.

Endgames can be classified according to the type of pieces remaining on the board. Basic checkmates are positions where one side has only a king and the other side has one or two pieces and can checkmate the opposing king, with the pieces working together with their king. For example, king and pawn endgames involve only kings and pawns on one or both sides and the task of the stronger side is to promote one of the pawns. Other more complicated endings are classified according to the pieces on the board other than kings, e.g. &quot;rook and pawn versus rook endgame&quot;.

<text>Year 326 ([[Roman numerals|CCCXXVI]]) was a common year starting on Saturday of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Constantinus and Constantinus (or, less frequently, year 1079 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 326 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

<doc id="47382" wikidata="Q192920" url="?curid=47382" title="Edward the Martyr">
<text>Edward the Martyr ( – 18 March 978) was King of the English from 8 July 975 until he was killed in 978. He was the eldest son of King Edgar (r. 959–975). On Edgar&#x27;s death, the succession to the throne was contested between Edward&#x27;s supporters and those of his younger half-brother, the future King Æthelred the Unready. As they were both children, it is unlikely that they played an active role in the dispute, which was probably between rival family alliances. Edward&#x27;s principal supporters were Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Æthelwine, Ealdorman of East Anglia, while Æthelred was backed by his mother, Queen Ælfthryth and her friend Æthelwold, Bishop of Winchester. The dispute was quickly settled. Edward was chosen as king and Æthelred received the lands traditionally allocated to the king&#x27;s eldest son in compensation.

Edgar had been a strong and overbearing king and a supporter of the monastic reform movement. He had forced the lay nobility and secular clergy to surrender land and sell it at low prices to the monasteries. Æthelwold had been the most active and ruthless in seizing land for his monasteries with Edgar&#x27;s assistance. The nobles took advantage of Edgar&#x27;s death to get their lands back, mainly by legal actions but sometimes by force. The leading magnates were split into two factions, the supporters of Ælfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia and Æthelwine, who both seized some monastic lands which they believed belonged to them, but also estates claimed by their rivals. The disputes never led to warfare.

Edward&#x27;s short reign was brought to an end by his murder in March 978 in unclear circumstances. He was killed on the Dowager Queen Ælfthryth&#x27;s estate at the Gap of Corfe in Dorset, and hurriedly buried at Wareham. A year later, his body was translated with great ceremony to Shaftesbury Abbey in Dorset. Contemporary writers do not name the murderer, but almost all narratives in the period after the Norman Conquest name Ælfthryth. Some modern historians agree, but others do not. Another theory is that the killers were thegns of Æthelred, probably acting without orders.

Medieval kings were believed to be sacrosanct, and Edward&#x27;s murder deeply troubled contemporaries who regarded it as a mortal sin. He soon came to be revered as a saint, and his feast of 18 March is still listed in the festal calendar of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; of the Church of England. Edward was known in his own time for his extreme violence, and historians consider his veneration thoroughly undeserved. The historian Tom Watson comments: &quot;For an obnoxious teenager who showed no evidence of sanctity or kingly attributes and who should have been barely a footnote, his cult has endured mightily well.&quot;

== Sources ==
The historian Levi Roach comments: &quot;Little is known about Edward&#x27;s reign save what can be gleaned from a few short notices in the &quot;Chronicle&quot; and the three authentic charters in his name.&quot; Other pre-Conquest sources include Charter S 937 of around 999, which gives details of his election as king, Byrhtferth of Ramsey&#x27;s &quot;Life of St Oswald&quot;, written around 1000, and parts of some manuscripts of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; (&quot;ASC&quot;). The &quot;Passio et Miracula Sancti Eadwardi Regis et Martyris&quot; (&quot;Passion and Miracles of Saint Edward, King and Martyr&quot;), was written around 1100, probably by the hagiographer Goscelin. Post-Conquest chroniclers giving accounts of Edward&#x27;s reign include William of Malmesbury and John of Worcester.

== Background ==
In the ninth century, Anglo-Saxon England came under increasing attack from Viking raids, culminating with an invasion by the Viking Great Heathen Army in 865. By 878, the Vikings had overrun the kingdoms of Northumbria, East Anglia, and Mercia, and nearly conquered Wessex, but in that year the West Saxons achieved a decisive victory at the Battle of Edington under King Alfred the Great (871–899). Over the next fifty years, the West Saxons and Mercians gradually conquered the Viking-ruled areas, and in 927 Alfred&#x27;s grandson Æthelstan (924–939) became the first king of all England when he conquered Northumbria. He was succeeded by his half-brother and Edward&#x27;s grandfather, Edmund, who almost immediately lost control of the north to the Vikings, but recovered full control of England by 944. He was killed in a brawl with an outlaw in 946, and as his sons Eadwig and Edgar were infants, their uncle Eadred (946–955) became king. Like Edmund, Eadred inherited the kingship of the whole of England and soon lost it when York (southern Northumbria) accepted a Viking king, but he recovered it when the York magnates expelled King Erik Bloodaxe in 954.

Eadred&#x27;s key advisers included Dunstan, Abbot of Glastonbury and future Archbishop of Canterbury. Eadred, who suffered from ill health, was in his early thirties when he died in 955, and Eadwig succeeded at the age of around fifteen. He was the first king since the early ninth century not to face the threat of imminent foreign invasion, and England remained free from Viking attacks until 980, after Edward&#x27;s death. Eadwig showed himself from the start determined to establish his independence from his uncle&#x27;s advisers. He clashed with Dunstan and sent him into exile. In 957, the kingdom was divided between Eadwig, who kept Wessex, and Edward&#x27;s father Edgar, who became king of Mercia and other lands north of the Thames. It is unclear whether this had been planned since the beginning of his reign or was the result of a successful revolt brought about by Eadwig&#x27;s incompetence.

Eadwig died in 959, and Edgar succeeded to the rule of the whole kingdom. Eadwig had appointed Ælfhere to be ealdorman of Mercia, and he became the premier layman, a status he retained until his death in 983. His rise was at the expense of the family of Æthelstan Half-King, Ealdorman of East Anglia, leading to a rivalry between the families which disrupted the country in Edward&#x27;s reign. The Benedictine reform movement reached its peak in Edgar&#x27;s reign under the leadership of Dunstan, Oswald, Archbishop of York, and Æthelwold, Bishop of Winchester. It became dominant as a result of the strong support of Edgar, earning him high praise by contemporary and later monastic chroniclers. He was a strong, indeed overbearing ruler, and he enriched Benedictine monasteries by forcing the aristocracy and secular (non-monastic) religious institutions to surrender land to them. Æthelwold was the most active and ruthless of the Benedictine leaders in securing land to support his monasteries, in some cases driving secular clergy out of their establishments in favour of monks. Edgar died at the age of only thirty-one or thirty-two in 975.

== Family ==
Edward, who was born in around 962, was the eldest of the four known children of King Edgar. No contemporary source gives the name of Edward&#x27;s mother, and post-Conquest sources give varying accounts. The earliest is a life of Dunstan by Osbern of Canterbury, written around 1090. He wrote that Edward&#x27;s mother was a nun at Wilton Abbey whom the King seduced, and Dunstan punished Edgar by imposing a seven-year penance which delayed his coronation. Osbern&#x27;s account is rejected by later chroniclers and modern historians. When Eadmer wrote a life of Dunstan in the early twelfth century, he included an account of Edward&#x27;s parentage which he obtained from his friend Nicholas of Worcester, who consulted ancient chronicles. Nicholas said that Edward was the son of Edgar&#x27;s lawful wife Æthelflæd &quot;candida&quot; (the white), daughter of Ealdorman Ordmær. No ealdorman with that name is known, but some historians identify Æthelflæd&#x27;s parents as a &quot;vir potens&quot; (powerful man) called Ordmær and his wife Ealde, who gave Hatfield in Hertfordshire to Æthelstan Half-King in exchange for land in Devon. John of Worcester, writing in the early twelfth century, also said that Edward was the son of Æthelflæd, adding that she had the byname &quot;eneda&quot; (duck). Edgar, who was brought up by Æthelstan Half-King&#x27;s wife Ælfwynn, probably met Æthelflæd as a result of the connection between her father and his foster-father. Almost all modern historians who have discussed Edward&#x27;s parentage say that his mother was Æthelflæd, and most think that she was Edgar&#x27;s first wife. The historian Nicholas Brooks argues that Edgar must have married Æthelflæd because Dunstan backed Edward&#x27;s succession to the throne, and he was a strong opponent of irregular unions who would not have supported the claim of an illegitimate son. However, the historian Cyril Hart describes Edward as &quot;of doubtful legitimacy&quot;. Æthelflæd probably died shortly after his birth. Edward&#x27;s tutor in religion was Sideman, Bishop of Crediton.

Edgar had his only known daughter, Edith, by his second known consort, Wulfthryth, who retired shortly afterwards to Wilton Abbey with her child. In 964, Edgar married Ælfthryth, the widow of Æthelstan Half-King&#x27;s eldest son, Æthelwold. Her father was Ordgar, a leading Devonshire thegn who was appointed an ealdorman in the same year. She had two sons, Edmund, who died in 971, and the future King Æthelred the Unready, who was born around 968. She was the only wife of Edgar to be crowned, and she became a powerful political figure, especially in her son&#x27;s reign.

== Disputed succession ==
Edward is first recorded as a witness to the Winchester New Minster Charter in 966. Ælfthryth attested as the &quot;legitimate wife&quot; of the King and Edmund as his &quot;legitimate son&quot;, whereas Edward was described as &quot;begotten by the same king&quot;. It is uncertain whether this was on the King&#x27;s instruction, which would indicate that he wished to cut Edward out of the succession, or was ordered by Bishop Æthelwold, who was a friend and ally of Ælfthryth. The historian Barbara Yorke sees the denial of Edward&#x27;s legitimacy as &quot;opportunist special pleading&quot; by Æthelwold. A genealogy created at Dunstan&#x27;s Glastonbury Abbey around 969 gives Edward precedence over Edmund and Æthelred. When Edgar died on 8 July 975 there was a dispute over the succession, but as Edward was around thirteen and Æthelred six to nine, the historian Sean Miller observes that &quot;they were surely figureheads rather than active participants&quot;.

Some historians have seen Edward&#x27;s supporters as defenders of monastic reform and Æthelred&#x27;s as its opponents, but there were supporters on both sides, and this view is now generally rejected. The real reasons for choosing between them probably lay in family alliances. Bishop Æthelwold backed his friend Ælfthryth, who naturally put forward the claim of her son Æthelred, while Archbishop Dunstan was Edward&#x27;s chief supporter. According to John of Worcester, Archbishop Oswald also supported Edward. Oswald was at odds with Ealdorman Ælfhere, who probably supported Æthelred, together with his brother-in-law Ælfric Cild, while Ælfhere&#x27;s enemy Æthelwine (son of Æthelstan Half-King) probably backed Edward.

Byrhtferth&#x27;s life of Oswald portrays Edward as an unstable and violent young man:
:Now certain of the magnates of this realm wished to elect the elder son of King Edgar, named Edward, as king; some of the ealdormen wanted the younger son, because he seemed more gentle to everyone in word and deed. But the elder son struck not only fear but even terror into everyone; he hounded them not only with tongue-lashings but even with cruel beatings – and most of all those who were members of his own household.&quot;

The historian Frank Stenton comments in his &quot;magisterial and massively authoritative&quot; &quot;Anglo-Saxon England&quot;:
&quot;Long after [Edward] had passed into veneration as a saint it was remembered that his outbursts of rage had alarmed all who knew him ... It may have been partly for this reason that a large number of nobles resolved to promote the election of Æthelred, the younger brother.&quot;

The Benedictine monk Eadmer of Canterbury wrote in his hagiographical life of Dunstan:
:When this Edward ought to have been consecrated as king, many of the princes of the land sought to oppose that he should be made king, on the one hand, because they were wary of the severity of his character with which he had customarily criticized the excesses of his men fiercely and on the other because they knew that his mother, though legally married, had not, however, been consecrated to the kingdom – just as his father had not – when she gave birth to him.

The historian Ann Williams is sceptical of the last point, commenting that while it is possible that consecration of the king&#x27;s wife before she gave birth may have been an issue in the tenth century, Eadmer was writing in the early twelfth century when it was an argument raised in favour of King Henry I against his elder brother, and this may have influenced his interpretation. In addition, as Eadmer says that Edgar was not crowned until two years before his death, the same argument applied to Æthelred.

The dispute was soon settled. A calendar entry in a manuscript dating to the late tenth or early eleventh century gives the date of Edward&#x27;s election as king as 19 July, less than a fortnight after Edgar&#x27;s death. A charter probably dating to 999 states that Edward was unanimously chosen as king by the leading men of both orders. Æthelred was given the lands traditionally held by the king&#x27;s sons, including some which had been granted by Edgar to Abingdon Abbey, and which were now forcibly repossessed by the order of all the leading nobles. Æthelred commented in the charter that &quot;whether they did this thing justly or unjustly, they themselves may know&quot;, and he granted other lands to Abingdon in compensation. The charter probably reflects a settlement under which Æthelred&#x27;s supporters agreed to Edward&#x27;s succession in return for the land grant. He was crowned by Archbishop Dunstan at Kingston upon Thames, possibly on the same day he was elected.

The post-Conquest &quot;Passio&quot; gives a different account, claiming that Dunstan forced through the coronation of Edward as king: &quot;But when, at the time of [Edward&#x27;s] consecration, some of the leading men of the nation had wished to oppose [it], St Dunstan persevered single-mindedly in his election, and, taking hold of the banner of the holy cross which was customarily carried before him, he fixed it upright in the middle, and with the remaining pious bishops consecrated him king.&quot;

== Edward&#x27;s reign ==
=== The &quot;anti-monastic reaction&quot; ===
Edward&#x27;s succession was followed by what historians sometimes call the &quot;anti-monastic reaction&quot;. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, Ælfhere and many other nobles, described by &quot;ASC D&quot; as the &quot;adversaries of God&quot;, launched attacks on monasteries. His rival Æthelwine was called &quot;amicus Dei&quot; (friend of God), and portrayed as the chief defender of the monks, by Byrhtferth, who wrote that in Edward&#x27;s reign:
:the commonwealth of the entire realm was shaken; bishops were perplexed, ealdormen were angry, monks were struck with fear, the people were terrified, and the secular clerics were made happy, because their time had come. Abbots are now expelled, together with their monks; clerics are brought in together with their wives; and &#x27;the last error was worse than the first&#x27; ... Monks who were formerly accustomed to sit on caparisoned horses and with their companions to sing the melodious song of King David, could then be seen carting a burden, not being carried like the ancient patriarch on a carriage into Egypt, or walking about with companions and friends, &#x27;without a purse, without shoes&#x27;.

However, most historians are sceptical of the claim that the conflict was between the supporters and opponents of monasticism, and attribute the disturbances to the nobles&#x27; personal rivalries and their determination to recover or obtain compensation for lands which Edgar had forced them to give up to monasteries. Æthelwine founded Byrhtferth&#x27;s Ramsey Abbey, but he was remembered at Ely Abbey for stealing several of their estates. Ælfhere is said to have disbanded monasteries founded by Æthelwold, but also to have protected Æthelwold&#x27;s Ely from Æthelwine and been a benefactor of Dunstan&#x27;s Glastonbury and Æthelwold&#x27;s Abingdon. Williams comments that &quot;there was more to the seizure of monastic lands than anti-monasticism. In many, perhaps most cases, it was the sharp practice involved in acquiring lands for the reformed houses that was being questioned, as the sellers (who had probably been put under considerable pressure) or their heirs sought to obtain a price closer to the actual market value.&quot;

Historians find it very difficult to judge the extent of disorder in Edward&#x27;s reign in view of the very limited information available. At some point, Ælfhere and Æthelwine appear to have come close to open warfare, but there were no battles. A thegn called Leofsige seized estates at Peterborough, Oundle and Kettering, causing such disorder that no crops were sown for two years. Leofsige was killed by Æthelwine&#x27;s brother, Ælfwold, who was then pardoned for the crime by Bishop Æthelwold. The historian George Molyneaux is sceptical of the portrayal of Edward&#x27;s reign as a time of rampant strife in view of the lack of evidence of fighting.

=== Administration ===
&quot;Witans&quot; (king&#x27;s councils) met at Kingston upon Thames, perhaps on the occasion of Edward&#x27;s coronation, at Kirtlington in Oxfordshire after Easter 977, and at Calne in Wiltshire in the same year. The meeting at Calne was held on an upper storey which collapsed; many leading counsellors were injured and some killed, but Dunstan was unharmed because he was standing on a beam. Ælfhere attested first among the ealdormen and Æthelwine second in all of Edward&#x27;s charters, indicating that they retained their positions from the previous reign as the leading lay magnates. Edward&#x27;s first charter was attested by almost all the leading magnates, showing that his rule had been generally accepted. This is the first charter which lists the chronicler Æthelweard as an ealdorman and he was presumably appointed by Edward. There appear to have been no ealdormen covering the south of England in the early 970s, perhaps because Edgar&#x27;s authority was so great that he was able to cover the area personally. After Edward acceded, three ealdormen were appointed to cover the area, Æthelweard in west Wessex, Æthelmær in Hampshire and Eadwine in Sussex and Kent. If stability had depended on Edgar&#x27;s personal authority, then it is not surprising that the authorities found it so difficult to maintain order after his death. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; disapprovingly records the exile of Ealdorman Oslac of York during Edward&#x27;s reign, but the circumstances are unknown. Few other events are recorded during his reign: there was a severe famine in 976, Bishop Sideman died in 977, and in 978 Dunstan purchased land near Hendon in Middlesex from Edward.

=== Charters ===
The historian Simon Keynes sees a diplomatic tradition which extends from the charters late in Edgar&#x27;s reign to early in Æthelred&#x27;s, but excluding the intervening &quot;slightly anomalous&quot; charters of Edward. Five charters survive which purport to date to the three years and nine months of Edward&#x27;s reign, a low number as the average in the period was four to five a year. The authenticity of Charters S 828 and S 829 is disputed. Keynes says that they are fraudulent, but have witness lists which are probably based on genuine texts. The editor of these charters, Susan Kelly, describes them as &quot;very difficult documents&quot;, and thinks that they may be genuine. They both appear to have been drawn up at the same time by the same careless draftsman during or close to Edward&#x27;s reign. S 828 is a grant of thirteen hides of land at Kingston Bagpuize in Berkshire by King Edward to Bishop Ælfstan, probably of Ramsbury. S 829 grants seven hides in the same village to Abingdon Abbey. The boundary clause is the same in both charters, perhaps because the bishop and abbey held different scattered units within the estate. Charter S 831 from the Old Minster, Winchester, is probably authentic and is based on one of 941. It is a grant by Edward to his minister Ælfric of land at Wylye in Wiltshire. Charter S 832 is a large grant of land in Cornwall by Edward to Ealdorman Æthelweard. It is closely related to Charter S 830, a grant of land at Cheriton Bishop in Devon by Edward to his &quot;faithful vassal&quot; (&quot;fideli vasallo&quot;) Ælfsige. Both charters are from the Exeter archive but probably written at Crediton, and Hart doubts whether they are genuine in their present form.

=== Coinage ===
The only coin in common use in late Anglo-Saxon England was the silver penny. Until late in Edgar&#x27;s reign, pennies produced by mints in different towns varied in design, weight and fineness (silver content). In the early 970s, he brought in his reform coinage, with a single design and much greater uniformity of weight and fineness. The coins, with a design called the &quot;Small Cross&quot; type, had a left-facing bust of the King on the obverse surrounded by a circle with the King&#x27;s name (+EADGAR REX ANGLOR[UM]) around the edge. The reverse had a small cross in the centre with the moneyer&#x27;s name and mint-place around the edge. Edgar&#x27;s reform design was the sole coin type produced during Edward&#x27;s reign, and it was replaced early in Æthelred&#x27;s reign.

Edward&#x27;s coins were on average slightly lighter than those of Edgar and heavier than those of Æthelred. The fineness was high and uniform following Edgar&#x27;s reform at 96%, and this was maintained under Edward apart from a few slightly less fine coins produced in Lincoln and York. After Edward&#x27;s death fineness became more variable. During Edgar&#x27;s reign, dies for coins were almost all cut at one centre, probably Winchester, and distributed from there to other mints across the kingdom. Under Edward, the centre supplied a far small number of mints and it was supplemented by regional die-cutting centres. This may have been due to the difficult political situation in his reign.

== Death ==
Edward was killed on Ælfthryth&#x27;s estate in the Gap of Corfe in the Purbeck Hills in Dorset on the evening of 18 March 978. The only detailed pre-Conquest account is by Byrhtferth:
:One day towards evening the remarkable and elected king, seeking the consolations of brotherly love, arrived at the house where his beloved brother was living with the dowager queen, as we have said. The magnates and leading men went to meet him, as was only fitting; he [the younger son] remained inside with the dowager queen, his mother. Those magnates had agreed among themselves a wicked plot: they were possessed of so damnable an intention and so murky and diabolical a blindness, that they did not fear to lay hands on God&#x27;s anointed. Armed men surrounded him on all sides; with them was standing the royal butler, humbly waiting to be of service. The venerable king had with him very few soldiers, since he did not suspect anyone, trusting &quot;in the Lord and in the might of His power&quot;. He had been instructed in holy scripture under the tutelage of Bishop Sideman; he was strong in body and sturdy. For when the conspirators surrounded him — and it was just as the Jews once surrounded our Lord — he remained sitting on his horse, fearless. They were seized by a single madness, an equal insanity ... The soldiers laid hold of him: one on his right-hand side drew him towards him, as if he wished to give him a kiss; another grabbed his left side firmly and gave him the death blow. And the King shouted out, as best he could: &quot;What are you doing, breaking my right hand?&quot; And suddenly he fell from his horse, and he was dead. This martyr of God was lifted up by his thegns, and taken to the house of a certain churl, where no Gregorian chant and no funereal lament was heard; rather, this distinguished king of the whole country lay covered only by a cheap blanket, awaiting the light of day.

Byrhtferth does not say when and where Edward died, and the oldest surviving version of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; (&quot;ASC A&quot;) just says that he was killed in 978. &quot;ASC C&quot;, written in the 1040s after Edward had come to be seen as a saint, states that he was martyred. The fullest account of his death in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; is in the northern recension, &quot;ASC D&quot; and &quot;ASC E&quot;, which post-dates the Conquest. This gives the date and location of his death. No version of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; states who committed the murder, but the northern recension blames his relatives for failing to avenge his death, and a poem about Edward&#x27;s death dating to around 1000 says: &quot;It is certain that he died through envy, at the hands of his own kin.&quot;

Pre-Conquest accounts of the murder do not say who was responsible, whereas post-Conquest chroniclers and hagiographers almost all blame Ælfthryth. The &quot;Passio&quot; and John of Worcester claim that she ordered the killing, while William of Malmesbury has her handing him a drink to distract him and her servant stabbing him, and Henry of Huntingdon writes that she killed Edward herself. The &quot;Passio&quot; is so biased against Ælfthryth that it deletes favourable information about her in its sources, such as the &quot;Regularis Concordia&quot; of around 973, which laid down rules for monastic life. It gave Ælfthryth the role of protectress of nunneries, but the &quot;Passio&quot; changes the protectress to Edward&#x27;s mother.

Modern historians have offered a variety of interpretations of Edward&#x27;s killing. Some blame Ælfthryth&#x27;s followers and think that she may have been personally responsible. Cnut&#x27;s biographer, Michael Lawson, thinks that the failure to punish the killers is suspicious and points to Ælfthryth&#x27;s guilt. Roach disagrees, seeing the fact that no contemporary blamed Ælfthryth as significant, and comments that we must be careful not to see conspiracies which did not exist. The editor of the &quot;Passio&quot;, Christine Fell, points out that many of the details of Ælfthryth&#x27;s role appear in the earlier stories of the murders of Anglo-Saxon royals, Saint Kenelm by his sister and Saint Æthelberht by his potential mother-in-law. Fell argues that it was inevitable that Ælfthryth&#x27;s hagiographical role in the &quot;Passio&quot; would similarly be that of scapegoat. Yorke comments that such stories &quot;draw upon hagiographical conventions spiced with traditional beliefs in the enmity of step-mothers for step-children, and should not be taken as reliable accounts of what actually occurred&quot;.

Another theory is that the murder was the culmination of the conflict between Ælfhere and Æthelwine, and that Ælfhere had Edward killed to preserve his own power and put his own candidate on the throne. The historian Alan Thacker sees Ælfhere&#x27;s role in the reburial of Edward as an act of expiation. However, Roach points out that Byrhtferth praises Ælfhere&#x27;s role, even though he was hostile to the ealdorman, and would have condemned him if he had been implicated in the crime. The contemporary poem about Edward&#x27;s death praises Ælfhere&#x27;s role, describing him as &quot;most worthy leader&quot;. Miller thinks that Æthelred&#x27;s thegns probably acted on their own initiative in the hope of personal advancement.

Edward&#x27;s personality may have been a factor in his death, as afterwards the opposing factions were able to reach a compromise. There were few changes at court: Ælfthryth and Bishop Æthelwold became more prominent, but Edward&#x27;s officials mainly kept their positions. Williams challenges the consensus that Edward&#x27;s death was the result of a plot. She compares his death to an earlier outbreak of violence due to a misunderstanding:
:It is possible that King Edward&#x27;s death was also &#x27;accidental&#x27; in that, far from being planned, it arose from a provocative confrontation between the young king (prone to violent behaviour, according to Byrhtferth) and one or more of the noblemen attending on his brother. It remains curious that the perpetrator is not named; Edward&#x27;s grandfather King Edmund was killed in similar circumstances but &quot;it was widely known how he ended his life, that Leofa stabbed (&quot;ofstang&quot;) him at Pucklechurch&quot;. Could it be that too many people (perhaps not all of them belonging to Ælfthryth&#x27;s faction) were secretly relieved to be rid of a violent and unstable youth?

== Legacy ==
=== Burial and translation ===
Edward&#x27;s death deeply troubled contemporaries. Roach observes &quot;Medieval kings were felt to be touched by divinity; not only had they been chosen by God, but like bishops they were anointed into their office with holy oil. Royal consecration was a well-established tradition and the reformers had done much to emphasize the God-given nature of royal authority further ... To kill a king was, therefore, more than a crime – it was a sin of the first order.&quot; England had a long tradition of revering murdered kings as saints, and the circumstances of Edward&#x27;s death made it almost certain that he would come to be seen as a martyr, but this did not occur immediately. He was not regarded as saintly in his lifetime and he did not die defending Christianity. It was almost a year before he received royal burial, and the delay suggests that there was an argument over what to do with his body, with the case for honourable burial gradually gaining ground. &quot;ASC D&quot; and &quot;ASC E&quot; say that Edward was initially buried at Wareham without royal honour. Byrhtferth states that a year later &quot;the renowned Ealdorman Ælfhere arrived with a great train&quot;; he ordered Edward&#x27;s body to be disinterred, and it was found to be incorrupt, which was taken as a miraculous sign; the body was carried with great ceremony for burial in Shaftesbury Abbey, a house of nuns. As the senior ealdorman, Ælfhere was probably charged with arranging the translation of Edward&#x27;s body from Wareham to Shaftesbury for a proper burial to pave the way for Æthelred&#x27;s coronation on 4 May. The early eleventh century Archbishop of York, Wulfstan, wrote that his body was burned, and Keynes comments that &quot;the authority of Wulfstan is considerable&quot;, but as political circumstances required that Edward be decently buried, Ælfhere may have been charged with finding another body for the purpose.

Post-Conquest accounts, such as the &quot;Passio,&quot; have more complicated and hagiographical narratives. The &quot;Passio&quot; says that Ælfthryth had Edward&#x27;s body concealed in a marsh, where it was miraculously revealed in February 979 by a column of fire, and locals took it to Wareham church for burial. Ælfhere was filled with joy when he heard about the discovery of the body, and he took it to Shaftesbury for reburial in a more worthy place. The &quot;Passio&quot; goes on to say that in 1001 Edward told &quot;a certain religious&quot; in a vision of his wish to be moved from the churchyard to a more secure place in the abbey. This information was conveyed to the abbess, who passed it to King Æthelred, and he joyfully gave instructions for the relics to be again translated. He ordered Wulfsige, the Bishop of Sherborne, and another prelate, perhaps Ælfsige, the abbot of the New Minster, Winchester, to carry out the ceremony. The translation took place on 20 June, but the King could not be present because he was preoccupied with a Danish invasion. However, the historian Paul Hayward points out that this second translation is not mentioned in contemporary sources and no pre-Conquest calendar prescribes a feast on 20 June; he argues that it was an invention.

=== Early cult ===
Edward was recognised as a saint soon after his death, and Æthelred appears to have been the chief sponsor of his brother&#x27;s cult. It was promoted initially by the ecclesiastical and secular leadership to demonstrate the sanctity of the royal office, but as Viking raids intensified they came to be seen as punishment of the English people by God for a terrible crime, the killing of the Lord&#x27;s anointed, for which they needed to make amends. Sigeric, Archbishop of Canterbury from 990 to 994, persuaded Æthelred to establish a monastery at Cholsey in honour of Edward, and the king appointed Germanus as abbot. Edward&#x27;s cult was also recognised at Canterbury and promoted by Wulfstan. In 1001, Æthelred granted a former minster church and land at Bradford on Avon in Wiltshire to God and &quot;his saint, my brother Edward, whom, drenched with his own blood, the Lord has seen fit to magnify in our time with many miracles&quot;, to provide a refuge for the nuns and Edward&#x27;s relics against Viking attack. Sarah Foot describes the donation as &quot;somewhat bizarre&quot; as the Shaftesbury nunnery was in a fortified burh, whereas Bradford was unprotected. Byrhtferth says that the first miracles occurred at Edward&#x27;s tomb eleven years after his death.

Wulfstan&#x27;s &quot;Sermon of the Wolf to the English&quot; of around 1014 cites the murder of Edward and Æthelred being forced into exile by Sweyn&#x27;s conquest of England in 1013 as examples of betrayals of lords by the English. Out of twenty-five calendars dating to before 1100, Edward&#x27;s death date of 18 March is listed in eighteen; only nine saints were listed in more, and five also have a feast on 13 February commemorating his translation from Wareham to Shaftesbury. Æthelred&#x27;s eldest son, Æthelstan left £6 &quot;to Holy Cross and St Edward at Shaftesbury&quot; in his will, made on his deathbed in 1014. Cnut also patronised Edward&#x27;s cult, and the law code V Æthelred of 1008 includes a clause, possibly inserted by Cnut in around 1018, which commands that the feast of Edward&#x27;s martyrdom be celebrated on 18 March throughout England. The historian David Rollason argues that Æthelred and Cnut promoted Edward&#x27;s cult in order to heighten their prestige by emphasising the sanctity of their predecessor. The killing of Edward led to greater interest in other murdered royal saints by Oswald and in his monasteries, especially Ramsey and Winchcombe.

Æthelred&#x27;s failure as a king has been seen by post-Conquest writers and some modern historians as a result of Edward&#x27;s murder. Goscelin wrote in his life of Edith that Æthelred was unworthy to rule because &quot;his succession had been purchased with his brother&#x27;s blood&quot;. Stenton comments that Æthelred &quot;began to reign in an atmosphere of suspicion which destroyed the prestige of the Crown. It was never fully restored in his lifetime ... Much that has brought the condemnation of historians on King Æthelred may well be due in the last resort to the circumstances under which he became king.&quot; His ineffective conduct as king suggests &quot;the reaction of a weak king to the consciousness that he had come to power through what his subjects regarded as the worst crime committed among the English peoples since their first coming to Britain&quot;. Æthelred&#x27;s support for his brother&#x27;s cult has been seen as an attempt to dispel the cloud of suspicion which hung over him, but this view has been challenged since the late twentieth century by historians who have argued that contemporaries do not appear to have blamed Æthelred or his mother for the murder. Keynes argues that if the royal family had been blamed for Edward&#x27;s death, glorification of him would have drawn attention to the crime and undermined Æthelred&#x27;s position.

Several religious communities claimed to have acquired parts of Edward&#x27;s body during Cnut&#x27;s reign, but William of Malmesbury stated that half of Edward&#x27;s body was taken to Leominster and half to Abingdon, where they both crumbled, and only the lung remained at Shaftesbury, where it was displayed, continuing to throb.

=== Later cult ===
Edward was the only tenth century king to be buried in a nunnery. Shaftesbury, which had been founded by Alfred the Great for one of his daughters, had strong royal connections, and the cult of Edward was valuable to it, giving it a high status among Wessex monasteries. At the end of the Anglo-Saxon period it was the richest Benedictine nunnery and Glastonbury the richest monastery of all. Later in the Middle Ages there was a saying that &quot;If the abbot of Glastonbury might marry the abbess of Shaftesbury, their heir would have more land than the King of England&quot;. Edward&#x27;s cult was important for the prosperity of the nunnery and town of Shaftesbury in the later Middle Ages, and in some medieval documents the town is called &quot;Edwardsstowe&quot;, &quot;the holy place of Edward&quot;.

Lanfranc, the first Norman Archbishop of Canterbury, denied the sanctity of many Anglo-Saxon saints. Edward&#x27;s cult survived but it was regarded as &quot;rustic&quot; and relegated to a minor status only to be honoured in establishments with a particular reason to honour him, such as Shaftesbury. His cult revived in the later Middle Ages, although almost wholly in the southern half of the country. He was regarded as one of the English national saints until they were relegated by the Plantagenets&#x27; preference for the more martial figure of Saint George. Edward survived the English Reformation, but as a low key figure only remembered on his feast day. Edward&#x27;s feast of 18 March is still listed in the festal calendar of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; of the Church of England. The historian Frank Barlow comments that popular detestation of the crime led people to transform an unpleasant youth into a royal martyr.

=== Dispute over Edward&#x27;s bones ===
Shaftesbury Abbey was dissolved in 1539 and the buildings were almost wholly dismantled. Between 1930 and 1932, an amateur historian, John Wilson-Claridge, conducted excavations in the ruins of the abbey. No report of the excavations was ever published, but he claimed to have found the bones of Edward the Martyr in the north transept. The discovery was praised in &quot;The Times&quot; as one of the greatest historical discoveries of the century. In 1963, the bones were examined by the forensic pathologist Thomas Stowell, who concluded that they were of a young man between the ages of seventeen and nineteen who had suffered injuries consistent with the description of the murder in Byrhtferth&#x27;s account. Stowell concluded that beyond reasonable doubt the bones were of Edward the Martyr. One of the bones was carbon-dated and found to date to the correct period. Historians&#x27; accounts of Stowell&#x27;s findings usually mention that they were contradicted by the British Museum osteoarchaeologist Don Brothwell, who is believed to have examined the bones and concluded that they were of an older man and that the damage was probably post-mortem, although no report of his examination was ever published.

Wilson-Claridge negotiated with a number of churches to take the bones, but none were willing to agree to his requirement that they would be housed and revered as the true relics of the saint. In 1980, Wilson-Claridge met, in his own words, &quot;by divine providence&quot; a Mr Pobjoy, who was a member of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad (ROCA), which agreed to accept the bones on Wilson-Claridge&#x27;s terms. Wilson-Claridge&#x27;s brother strongly objected to the bones going to ROCA, arguing that they should go back to Shaftesbury. The dispute was debated in letters to &quot;The Times&quot;, including one from Keynes which objected to the bones going to a Russian Orthodox church: &quot;No Saxon can have deserved that fate&quot;. In 1988, a High Court hearing ruled that the bones could go to the ROCA Church of St Edward the Martyr, Brookwood, which had been established for the purpose. Historians are very sceptical that the bones in the Brookwood church are those of Edward the Martyr, both because the body taken to Shaftesbury in 979 was probably not Edward&#x27;s, and because the bones found in 1931 were probably not the ones believed by contemporaries to be his.

=== Churches dedicated to Edward the Martyr ===

Churches dedicated to Edward the Martyr are the Church of St Edward King and Martyr, in Goathurst, Somerset, the Church of St Edward King and Martyr in Peas Hill, Cambridge, the Church of St Edward, King and Martyr, Corfe Castle, the Church of St Edward King &amp; Martyr, Castle Donington, and the Church of St Edward the Martyr, New York.

<text>Year 306 ([[Roman numerals|CCCVI]]) was a common year starting on Tuesday of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Constantius and Valerius (or, less frequently, year 1059 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 306 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

* July 25 – Constantius I dies outside Eboracum (modern-day York). Constantine, aged 23 or 24, is declared emperor by his troops. Emperor Galerius grants Constantine the title of Caesar, and elevates Flavius Valerius Severus to emperor in the Western part of the Roman Empire.
* Constantine institutes toleration of the Christians in his territories.
* Constantine establishes his capital in Augusta Treverorum (Trier). He begins a major expansion of the city, strengthening the walls, expanding the palace complex and building the Imperial Baths.
* Building on the efforts of Diocletian, Galerius introduces the poll tax to central and southern Italy and truncates the size of the Praetorian Guard, with plans to disband the Guard altogether.
* October 28 – Maxentius, son of former Western Emperor Maximian, leads a revolt by the Praetorian Guard and members of the Senate in Rome, and is proclaimed Emperor.

<text>Brooklyn is a borough of New York City located at the westernmost end of Long Island in the State of New York. Formerly an independent city, the borough is coextensive with Kings County, one of twelve original counties established under British rule in 1683 in the then Province of New York. As of the 2020 United States census, the population stood at 2,736,074, making it the most populous of the five boroughs of New York City, and the most populous county in the state. Brooklyn, at , is the second most densely populated county in the U.S. after Manhattan (New York County), as of 2022. Had Brooklyn remained an independent city, it would now be the fourth most populous American city after the rest of New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago.

Named after the Dutch town of Breukelen in the Netherlands, Brooklyn shares a land border with the borough and county of Queens. It has several bridge and tunnel connections to the borough of Manhattan, across the East River (most famously, the architecturally significant Brooklyn Bridge), and is connected to Staten Island by way of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. With a land area of and a water area of , Kings County is the state of New York&#x27;s fourth-smallest county by land area and third smallest by total area.

Brooklyn was founded by the Dutch in the 17thcentury and grew into a busy port city on New York Harbor by the 19thcentury. On January1, 1898, after a long political campaign and public-relations battle during the 1890s and despite opposition from Brooklyn residents, Brooklyn was consolidated in and annexed (along with other areas) to form the current five-borough structure of New York City in accordance to the new municipal charter of &quot;Greater New York&quot;. The borough continues to maintain some distinct culture. Many Brooklyn neighborhoods are ethnic enclaves. With Jews forming around a quarter of its population, the borough has been described as &quot;the most Jewish spot on Earth&quot;. Brooklyn&#x27;s official motto, displayed on the borough seal and flag, is , which translates from early modern Dutch as &#x27;Unity makes strength&#x27;.

Educational institutions in Brooklyn include the City University of New York&#x27;s Brooklyn College, Medgar Evers College, and College of Technology, as well as, New York University Tandon School of Engineering. In sports, basketball&#x27;s Brooklyn Nets, and New York Liberty play at the Barclays Center. In the first decades of the 21stcentury, Brooklyn has experienced a renaissance as a destination for hipsters, with concomitant gentrification, dramatic house-price increases, and a decrease in housing affordability. Some new developments are required to include affordable housing units. Since the 2010s, parts of Brooklyn have evolved into a hub of entrepreneurship, high-technology startup firms, postmodern art, and design.

==Toponymy==
The name Brooklyn is derived from the original Dutch town of Breukelen. The oldest mention of the settlement in the Netherlands is in a charter of 953 by Holy Roman Emperor Otto I as &quot;Broecklede&quot;. This form is made up of the words &quot;broeck&quot;, meaning bog or marshland, and &quot;lede&quot;, meaning small (dug) water stream, specifically in peat areas. Breuckelen on the American continent was established in 1646, and the name first appeared in print in 1663.

Over the past two millennia, the name of the ancient town in Holland has been &quot;Bracola&quot;, &quot;Broccke&quot;, &quot;Brocckede&quot;, &quot;Broiclede&quot;, &quot;Brocklandia&quot;, &quot;Broekclen&quot;, &quot;Broikelen&quot;, &quot;Breuckelen,&quot; and finally &quot;Breukelen&quot;. The New Amsterdam settlement of &quot;Breuckelen&quot; also went through many spelling variations, including &quot;Breucklyn&quot;, &quot;Breuckland&quot;, &quot;Brucklyn&quot;, &quot;Broucklyn&quot;, &quot;Brookland&quot;, &quot;Brockland&quot;, &quot;Brocklin&quot;, and &quot;Brookline/Brook-line&quot;. There have been so many variations of the name that its origin has been debated; some have claimed &quot;breuckelen&quot; means &quot;broken land&quot;. The current name, however, is the one that best reflects its meaning.

The county&#x27;s name, Kings County, was named after King Charles II of England.

==History==
The history of European settlement in Brooklyn spans more than 350 years. The settlement began in the 17th century as the small Dutch-founded town of &quot;Breuckelen&quot; on the East River shore of Long Island, grew to be a sizeable city in the 19th century and was consolidated in 1898 with New York City (then confined to Manhattan and the Bronx), the remaining rural areas of Kings County, and the largely rural areas of Queens and Staten Island, to form the modern City of New York.

===Colonial era===
====New Netherland====
The Dutch were the first Europeans to settle Long Island&#x27;s western edge, which was then largely inhabited by the Lenape, an Algonquian-speaking American Indian tribe often referred to in European documents by a variation of the place name &quot;Canarsie&quot;. Bands were associated with place names, but the colonists thought their names represented different tribes. The &quot;Breuckelen&quot; settlement was named after Breukelen in the Netherlands; it was part of New Netherland. The Dutch West India Company lost little time in chartering the six original parishes (listed here by their later English town names):
*Gravesend: in 1645, settled under Dutch patent by English followers of Anabaptist Deborah Moody, named for &#x27;s-Gravenzande, Netherlands, or Gravesend, England;
*Brooklyn Heights: chartered as &quot;Breuckelen&quot; in 1646, after the town now spelled Breukelen, Netherlands. Breuckelen was along Fulton Street (now Fulton Mall) between Hoyt Street and Smith Street (according to H. Stiles and P. Ross). Brooklyn Heights, or Clover Hill, is where the village of Brooklyn was founded in 1816;
*Flatlands: chartered as &quot;Nieuw Amersfoort&quot; in 1647;
*Flatbush: chartered as &quot;Midwout&quot; in 1652;
*&quot;Nieuw Utrecht&quot; in 1652, named after the city of Utrecht, Netherlands; and
*Bushwick: chartered as &quot;Boswijck&quot; in 1661.

The colony&#x27;s capital of New Amsterdam, across the East River, obtained its charter in 1653. The neighborhood of Marine Park was home to North America&#x27;s first tide mill. It was built by the Dutch, and the foundation can be seen today. But the area was not formally settled as a town. Many incidents and documents relating to this period are in Gabriel Furman&#x27;s 1824 compilation.

====Province of New York====

Present-day Brooklyn left Dutch hands after the English captured the New Netherland colony in 1664, a prelude to the Second Anglo-Dutch War. New Netherland was taken in a naval action, and the English renamed the new capture for their naval commander, James, Duke of York, brother of the then monarch King Charles II and future king himself as King James II. Brooklyn became a part of the West Riding of York Shire in the Province of New York, one of the Middle Colonies of nascent British America.

On November 1, 1683, &quot;Kings County&quot; was partitioned from the West Riding of York Shire, containing the six old Dutch towns on southwestern Long Island, as one of the &quot;original twelve counties&quot;. This tract of land was recognized as a political entity for the first time, and the municipal groundwork was laid for a later expansive idea of a Brooklyn identity.

Lacking the patroon and tenant farmer system established along the Hudson River Valley, this agricultural county unusually came to have one of the highest percentages of slaves among the population in the &quot;Original Thirteen Colonies&quot; along the Atlantic Ocean eastern coast of North America.

====Revolutionary War====
On August 27, 1776, the Battle of Long Island (also known as the &#x27;Battle of Brooklyn&#x27;) was fought, the first major engagement fought in the American Revolutionary War after independence was declared, and the largest of the entire conflict. British troops forced Continental Army troops under George Washington off the heights near the modern sites of Green-Wood Cemetery, Prospect Park, and Grand Army Plaza.

Washington, viewing particularly fierce fighting at the Gowanus Creek and Old Stone House from atop a hill near the west end of present-day Atlantic Avenue, was reported to have emotionally exclaimed: &quot;What brave men I must this day lose!&quot;.

The fortified American positions at Brooklyn Heights consequently became untenable and were evacuated a few days later, leaving the British in control of New York Harbor. While Washington&#x27;s defeat on the battlefield cast early doubts on his ability as the commander, the tactical withdrawal of all his troops and supplies across the East River in a single night is now seen by historians as one of his most brilliant triumphs.

The British controlled the surrounding region for the duration of the war, as New York City was soon occupied and became their military and political base of operations in North America for the remainder of the conflict. The Patriot residents largely fled or were cleared from the area, and afterward the British generally enjoyed a dominant Loyalist sentiment from the residents in Kings County who did not evacuate, though the region was also the center of the fledgling—and largely successful—Patriot intelligence network, headed by Washington himself.

The British set up a system of prison ships off the coast of Brooklyn in Wallabout Bay. More American patriots died there than in combat on all the battlefield engagements of the American Revolutionary War combined. One result of the Treaty of Paris in 1783 was the evacuation of the British from New York City, which was celebrated by New Yorkers into the 20th century.

===Post-independence era===
====Urbanization====

The first half of the 19th century saw the beginning of the development of urban areas on the economically strategic East River shore of Kings County, facing the adolescent City of New York confined to Manhattan Island. The New York Navy Yard operated in Wallabout Bay (border between Fort Greene and Williamsburg) during the 19th century and two-thirds of the 20th century.

The first center of urbanization sprang up in the Town of Brooklyn, directly across from Lower Manhattan, which saw the incorporation of the Village of Brooklyn in 1816. Reliable steam ferry service across the East River to Fulton Landing converted Brooklyn Heights into a commuter town for Wall Street. Ferry Road to Jamaica Pass became Fulton Street to East New York. Town and Village were combined to form the first, kernel incarnation of the City of Brooklyn in 1834.

In a parallel development, the Town of Bushwick, farther up the river, saw the incorporation of the Village of Williamsburgh in 1827, which separated as the Town of Williamsburgh in 1840 and formed the short-lived City of Williamsburgh in 1851. Industrial deconcentration in the mid-century was bringing shipbuilding and other manufacturing to the northern part of the county. Each of the two cities and six towns in Kings County remained independent municipalities and purposely created non-aligning street grids with different naming systems.

However, the East River shore was growing too fast for the three-year-old infant City of Williamsburg; it, along with its Town of Bushwick hinterland, was subsumed within a greater City of Brooklyn in 1855, subsequently dropping the &#x27;h&#x27; from its name.

By 1841, with the appearance of &quot;The Brooklyn Eagle, and Kings County Democrat&quot; published by Alfred G. Stevens, the growing city across the East River from Manhattan was producing its own prominent newspaper. It later became the most popular and highest circulation afternoon paper in America. The publisher changed to L. Van Anden on April 19, 1842, and the paper was renamed &quot;The Brooklyn Daily Eagle and Kings County Democrat&quot; on June 1, 1846. On May 14, 1849, the name was shortened to &quot;The Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot;; on September 5, 1938, it was further shortened to &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot;. The establishment of the paper in the 1840s helped develop a separate identity for Brooklynites over the next century. The borough&#x27;s soon-to-be-famous National League baseball team, the Brooklyn Dodgers, also assisted with this. Both major institutions were lost in the 1950s: the paper closed in 1955 after unsuccessful attempts at a sale following a reporters&#x27; strike, and the baseball team decamped for Los Angeles in a realignment of Major League Baseball in 1957.

Agitation against Southern slavery was stronger in Brooklyn than in New York, and under Republican leadership, the city was fervent in the Union cause in the Civil War. After the war the Henry Ward Beecher Monument was built downtown to honor a famous local abolitionist. A great victory arch was built at what was then the south end of town to celebrate the armed forces; this place is now called Grand Army Plaza.

The number of people living in Brooklyn grew rapidly early in the 19th century. There were 4,402 by 1810, 7,175 in 1820 and 15,396 by 1830. The city&#x27;s population was 25,000 in 1834, but the police department comprised only 12 men on the day shift and another 12 on the night shift. Every time a rash of burglaries broke out, officials blamed burglars from New York City. Finally, in 1855, a modern police force was created, employing 150 men. Voters complained of inadequate protection and excessive costs. In 1857, the state legislature merged the Brooklyn force with that of New York City.

====Civil War====
Fervent in the Union cause, the city of Brooklyn played a major role in supplying troops and materiel for the American Civil War. The best-known regiment to be sent off to war from the city was the 14th Brooklyn &quot;Red Legged Devils&quot;. They fought from 1861 to 1864, wore red the entire war, and were the only regiment named after a city. President Abraham Lincoln called them into service, making them part of a handful of three-year enlisted soldiers in April 1861. Unlike other regiments during the American Civil War, the 14th wore a uniform inspired by the French Chasseurs, a light infantry used for quick assaults.

As a seaport and a manufacturing center, Brooklyn was well prepared to contribute to the Union&#x27;s strengths in shipping and manufacturing. The two combined in shipbuilding; the ironclad &quot;Monitor&quot; was built in Brooklyn.

====Twin city====
Brooklyn is referred to as the twin city of New York in the 1883 poem, &quot;The New Colossus&quot; by Emma Lazarus, which appears on a plaque inside the Statue of Liberty. The poem calls New York Harbor &quot;the air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame&quot;. As a twin city to New York, it played a role in national affairs that was later overshadowed by decades of subordination by its old partner and rival.

During this period, the affluent, contiguous districts of Fort Greene and Clinton Hill (then characterized collectively as The Hill) were home to such notable figures as Astral Oil Works founder Charles Pratt and his children, including local civic leader Charles Millard Pratt; Theosophical Society co-founder William Quan Judge; and Pfizer co-founders Charles Pfizer and Charles F. Erhart. Brooklyn Heights remained one of the New York metropolitan area&#x27;s most august patrician redoubts into the early 20th century under the aegis of such figures as abolitionist clergyman Henry Ward Beecher, Congregationalist theologians Lyman Abbott and Newell Dwight Hillis (who followed Beecher as the second and third pastors of Plymouth Church, respectively), financier John Jay Pierrepont (a grandson of founding Heights resident Hezekiah Pierrepont), banker/art collector David Leavitt, educator/politician Seth Low, merchant/banker Horace Brigham Claflin, attorney William Cary Sanger (who served for two years as United States Assistant Secretary of War under Presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt) and publisher Alfred Smith Barnes. Contiguous to the Heights, the less exclusive South Brooklyn was home to longtime civic leader James S. T. Stranahan, who became known (often derisively) as the &quot;Baron Haussmann of Brooklyn&quot; for championing Prospect Park and other public works.

Economic growth continued, propelled by immigration and industrialization, and Brooklyn established itself as the third-most populous American city for much of the 19th century. The waterfront from Gowanus to Greenpoint was developed with piers and factories. Industrial access to the waterfront was improved by the Gowanus Canal and the canalized Newtown Creek. was the most famous product of the large and growing shipbuilding industry of Williamsburg. After the Civil War, trolley lines and other transport brought urban sprawl beyond Prospect Park (completed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux in 1873 and widely heralded as an improvement upon the earlier Central Park) into the center of the county, as evinced by gradual settlement in the comparatively rustic villages of Windsor Terrace and Kensington in the Town of Flatbush. By century&#x27;s end, Dean Alvord&#x27;s Prospect Park South development (adjacent to the village of Flatbush) would serve as the template for contemporaneous &quot;Victorian Flatbush&quot; micro-neighborhoods and the post-consolidation emergence of outlying districts, such as Midwood and Marine Park. Along with Oak Park, Illinois, it also presaged the automobile and commuter rail-driven vogue for more remote prewar suburban communities, such as Garden City, New York and Montclair, New Jersey.

The rapidly growing population needed more water, so the City built centralized waterworks, including the Ridgewood Reservoir. The municipal Police Department, however, was abolished in 1854 in favor of a Metropolitan force covering also New York and Westchester Counties. In 1865 the Brooklyn Fire Department (BFD) also gave way to the new Metropolitan Fire District.

Throughout this period the peripheral towns of Kings County, far from Manhattan and even from urban Brooklyn, maintained their rustic independence. The only municipal change seen was the secession of the eastern section of the Town of Flatbush as the Town of New Lots in 1852. The building of rail links such as the Brighton Beach Line in 1878 heralded the end of this isolation.

Sports in Brooklyn became a business. The Brooklyn Bridegrooms played professional baseball at Washington Park in the convenient suburb of Park Slope and elsewhere. Early in the next century, under their new name of Brooklyn Dodgers, they brought baseball to Ebbets Field, beyond Prospect Park. Racetracks, amusement parks, and beach resorts opened in Brighton Beach, Coney Island, and elsewhere in the southern part of the county.
Toward the end of the 19th century, the City of Brooklyn experienced its final, explosive growth spurt. Park Slope was rapidly urbanized, with its eastern summit soon emerging as the city&#x27;s third &quot;Gold Coast&quot; district alongside Brooklyn Heights and The Hill; notable residents of the era included American Chicle Company co-founder Thomas Adams Jr. and New York Central Railroad executive Clinton L. Rossiter. East of The Hill, Bedford-Stuyvesant coalesced as an upper middle class enclave for lawyers, shopkeepers, and merchants of German and Irish descent (notably exemplified by John C. Kelley, a water meter magnate and close friend of President Grover Cleveland), with nearby Crown Heights gradually fulfilling an analogous role for the city&#x27;s Jewish population as development continued through the early 20th century. Northeast of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Bushwick (by now a working class, predominantly German district) established a considerable brewery industry; the so-called &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Row&quot; encompassed 14 breweries operating in a 14-block area in 1890. On the southwestern waterfront of Kings County, railroads and industrialization spread to Sunset Park (then coterminous with the city&#x27;s sprawling, sparsely populated Eighth Ward) and adjacent Bay Ridge (hitherto a resort-like subsection of the Town of New Utrecht). Within a decade, the city had annexed the Town of New Lots in 1886; the Towns of Flatbush, Gravesend and New Utrecht in 1894; and the Town of Flatlands in 1896. Brooklyn had reached its natural municipal boundaries at the ends of Kings County.

=====Seth Low as mayor=====
Low&#x27;s time in office from 1882 to 1885 was marked by a number of reforms:

* Secured a degree of &quot;home rule&quot; of the city. Previously, the State Government dictated city policies, hiring, salaries, and other affairs. Low managed to secure an unofficial veto over all Brooklyn bills in the State Assembly.
* Instituted a number of educational reforms. He was the first to integrate Brooklyn schools. He introduced free textbooks for all students, not just those who had taken a pauper&#x27;s oath. He instituted a competitive examination for hiring teachers, instead of giving teaching jobs to pay political debts. He set aside $430,000 () for the construction of new schools to accommodate 10,000 new students.
* Introduced Civil Service Code to all city employees, eliminating patronage jobs.
* German Americans wanted to enjoy their local beer gardens on the Sabbath, in violation of state &quot;dry&quot; laws and the demands of local puritanical clergy. Low&#x27;s compromise solution was that saloons could stay open as long as they were orderly. At the first sign of rowdiness, they would be closed.
* Served as a member of the board of the New York Bridge Company, the company that built the Brooklyn Bridge, and led an unsuccessful effort to remove Washington Roebling as the chief engineer on that project.
* Raised the tax rate from 2.33% of $100 assessed valuation in 1881 to 2.59% in 1883. He also went after property owners who had not paid back taxes. This increase in city revenue enabled him to reduce the city&#x27;s debt and increase services. However, raising taxes proved extremely unpopular.

=====Mayors of the City of Brooklyn=====

Brooklyn elected a mayor from 1834 until 1898, after which it was consolidated into the City of Greater New York, whose own second mayor (1902–1903), Seth Low, had been Mayor of Brooklyn from 1882 to 1885. Since 1898, Brooklyn has, in place of a separate mayor, elected a Borough President.
===New York City borough===
In 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was completed, transportation to Manhattan was no longer by water only, and the City of Brooklyn&#x27;s ties to the City of New York were strengthened.

The question became whether Brooklyn was prepared to engage in the still-grander process of consolidation then developing throughout the region, whether to join with the county of Richmond and the western portion of Queens County, and the county of New York, which by then already included the Bronx, to form the five boroughs of a united City of New York. Andrew Haswell Green and other progressives said yes, and eventually, they prevailed against the &quot;Daily Eagle&quot; and other conservative forces. In 1894, residents of Brooklyn and the other counties voted by a slight majority to merge, effective in 1898.

Kings County retained its status as one of New York State&#x27;s counties, but the loss of Brooklyn&#x27;s separate identity as a city was met with consternation by some residents at the time. Many newspapers of the day called the merger the &quot;Great Mistake of 1898&quot;.

==Geography==
Brooklyn is in area, of which is land (73%), and is water (27%); the borough is the second-largest by land area among the New York City&#x27;s boroughs. However, Kings County, coterminous with Brooklyn, is New York State&#x27;s fourth-smallest county by land area and third-smallest by total area. Brooklyn lies at the southwestern end of Long Island, and the borough&#x27;s western border constitutes the island&#x27;s western tip.

Brooklyn&#x27;s water borders are extensive and varied, including Jamaica Bay; the Atlantic Ocean; The Narrows, separating Brooklyn from the borough of Staten Island in New York City and crossed by the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge; Upper New York Bay, separating Brooklyn from Jersey City and Bayonne in the U.S. state of New Jersey; and the East River, separating Brooklyn from the borough of Manhattan in New York City and traversed by the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, the Brooklyn Bridge, the Manhattan Bridge, the Williamsburg Bridge, and numerous routes of the New York City Subway. To the east of Brooklyn lies the borough of Queens, which contains John F. Kennedy International Airport in that borough&#x27;s Jamaica neighborhood, approximately two miles from the border of Brooklyn&#x27;s East New York neighborhood.

===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Brooklyn experiences a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;), with partial shielding from the Appalachian Mountains and moderating influences from the Atlantic Ocean. Brooklyn receives plentiful precipitation all year round, with nearly yearly. The area averages 234 days with at least some sunshine annually, and averages 57% of possible sunshine annually, accumulating 2,535 hours of sunshine per annum. Brooklyn lies in the USDA plant hardiness zone 7b.

===Boroughscape===

==Neighborhoods==


Brooklyn&#x27;s neighborhoods are dynamic in ethnic composition. For example, the early to mid-20th century, Brownsville had a majority of Jewish residents; since the 1970s it has been majority African American. Midwood during the early 20th century was filled with ethnic Irish, then filled with Jewish residents for nearly 50 years, and is slowly becoming a Pakistani enclave. Brooklyn&#x27;s most populous racial group, white, declined from 97.2% in 1930 to 46.9% by 1990.

The borough attracts people previously living in other cities in the United States. Of these, most come from Chicago, Detroit, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, Boston, Cincinnati, and Seattle.

===Community diversity===

Given New York City&#x27;s role as a crossroads for immigration from around the world, Brooklyn has evolved a globally cosmopolitan ambiance of its own, demonstrating a robust and growing demographic and cultural diversity with respect to metrics including nationality, religion, race, and domiciliary partnership. In 2010, 51.6% of the population was counted as members of religious congregations. In 2014, there were 914 religious organizations in Brooklyn, the 10th most of all counties in the nation. Brooklyn contains dozens of distinct neighborhoods representing many of the major culturally identified groups found within New York City. Among the most prominent are listed below:

====Jewish American====
Over 600,000 Jews, particularly Orthodox and Hasidic Jews, have become concentrated in such historically Jewish areas as Borough Park, Williamsburg, and Midwood, where there are many yeshivas, synagogues, and kosher restaurants, as well as a variety of Jewish businesses. Adjacent to Borough Park, the Kensington area housed a significant population of Conservative Jews (under the aegis of such nationally prominent midcentury rabbis as Jacob Bosniak and Abraham Heller) when it was still considered to be a subsection of Flatbush; many of their defunct facilities have been repurposed to serve extensions of the Borough Park Hasidic community. Other notable religious Jewish neighborhoods with a longstanding cultural lineage include Canarsie, Sea Gate, and Crown Heights, home to the Chabad world headquarters. Neighborhoods with largely defunct yet historically notable Jewish populations include central Flatbush, East Flatbush, Brownsville, East New York, Bensonhurst and Sheepshead Bay (particularly its Madison subsection). Many hospitals in Brooklyn were started by Jewish charities, including Maimonides Medical Center in Borough Park and Brookdale Hospital in East Flatbush.

According to the American Jewish Population Project in 2020, Brooklyn was home to over 480,000 Jews. In 2023, the UJA-Federation of New York estimated that Brooklyn is home to 462,000 Jews, a large decrease compared to the 561,000 estimated in 2011.

The predominantly Jewish, Crown Heights (and later East Flatbush)-based Madison Democratic Club served as the borough&#x27;s primary &quot;clubhouse&quot; political venue for decades until the ascendancy of Meade Esposito&#x27;s rival, Canarsie-based Thomas Jefferson Democratic Club in the 1960s and 1970s, playing an integral role in the rise of such figures as Speaker of the New York State Assembly Irwin Steingut; his son, fellow Speaker Stanley Steingut; New York City Mayor Abraham Beame; real estate developer Fred Trump; Democratic district leader Beadie Markowitz; and political fixer Abraham &quot;Bunny&quot; Lindenbaum.

Many non-Orthodox Jews (ranging from observant members of various denominations to atheists of Jewish cultural heritage) are concentrated in Ditmas Park and Park Slope, with smaller observant and culturally Jewish populations in Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill, Brighton Beach, and Coney Island.

====Chinese American====
Over 200,000 Chinese Americans live throughout the southern parts of Brooklyn, primarily concentrated in Sunset Park, Bensonhurst, Gravesend, and Homecrest. Brooklyn is the borough that is home to the highest number of Chinatowns in New York City. The largest concentration is in Sunset Park along 8th Avenue, which has become known for its Chinese culture since the opening of the now-defunct Winley Supermarket in 1986 spurred widespread settlement in the area. It is called &quot;Brooklyn&#x27;s Chinatown&quot; and originally it was a small Chinese enclave with Cantonese speakers being the main Chinese population during the late 1980s and 1990s, but since the 2000s, the Chinese population in the area dramatically shifted to majority Fuzhounese Americans, which contributed immensely to expanding this Chinatown, and bestowing the nicknames &quot;Fuzhou Town (), Brooklyn&quot; or the &quot;Little Fuzhou ()&quot; of Brooklyn. Many Chinese restaurants can be found throughout Sunset Park, and the area hosts a popular Chinese New Year celebration. Since the 2000s going forward, the growing concentration of the Cantonese speaking population in Brooklyn have dramatically shifted to Bensonhurst/Gravesend and Homecrest creating newer Chinatowns of Brooklyn and these newer Brooklyn Chinatowns are known as &quot;Brooklyn&#x27;s Little Hong Kong/Guangdong&quot; due to their Chinese populations being overwhelmingly Cantonese populated.

====Caribbean and African American====
Brooklyn&#x27;s African American and Caribbean communities are spread throughout much of Brooklyn. Brooklyn&#x27;s West Indian community is concentrated in the Crown Heights, Flatbush, East Flatbush, Kensington, and Canarsie neighborhoods in central Brooklyn. Brooklyn is home to the largest community of West Indians outside of the Caribbean. Although the largest West Indian groups in Brooklyn are Jamaicans, Guyanese and Haitians, there are West Indian immigrants from nearly every part of the Caribbean. Crown Heights and Flatbush are home to many of Brooklyn&#x27;s West Indian restaurants and bakeries. Brooklyn has an annual, celebrated Carnival in the tradition of pre-Lenten celebrations in the islands. Started by natives of Trinidad and Tobago, the West Indian Labor Day Parade takes place every Labor Day on Eastern Parkway. The Brooklyn Academy of Music also holds the DanceAfrica festival in late May, featuring street vendors and dance performances showcasing food and culture from all parts of Africa. Since the opening of the IND Fulton Street Line in 1936, Bedford-Stuyvesant has been home to one of the most famous African American communities in the United States. Working-class communities remain prevalent in Brownsville, East New York and Coney Island, while remnants of similar communities in Prospect Heights, Fort Greene and Clinton Hill have endured amid widespread gentrification.

====Hispanic American====

In the aftermath of World War II and subsequent urban renewal initiatives that decimated longtime Manhattan enclaves (most notably on the Upper West Side), Puerto Rican migrants began to settle in such waterfront industrial neighborhoods as Sunset Park, Red Hook and Gowanus, near the shipyards and factories where they worked. The borough&#x27;s Hispanic population diversified after the 1965 Hart-Cellar Act loosened restrictions on immigration from elsewhere in Latin America.

Bushwick has since emerged as the largest hub of Brooklyn&#x27;s Hispanic American community. Like other Hispanic neighborhoods in New York City, Bushwick has an established Puerto Rican presence, along with an influx of many Dominicans, South Americans, Central Americans and Mexicans. As nearly 80% of Bushwick&#x27;s population is Hispanic, its residents have created many businesses to support their various national and distinct traditions in food and other items. Sunset Park&#x27;s population is 42% Hispanic, made up of these various ethnic groups. Brooklyn&#x27;s main Hispanic groups are Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Dominicans and Ecuadorians; they are spread out throughout the borough. Puerto Ricans and Dominicans are predominant in Bushwick, Williamsburg&#x27;s South Side and East New York. Mexicans (especially from the state of Puebla) now predominate alongside Chinese immigrants in Sunset Park, although remnants of the neighborhood&#x27;s once-substantial postwar Puerto Rican and Dominican communities continue to reside below 39th Street. Save for Red Hook (which remained roughly one-fifth Hispanic American as of the 2010 Census), the South Side and Sunset Park, similar postwar communities in other waterfront neighborhoods—including western Park Slope, the north end of Greenpoint, and Boerum Hill, long considered the northern subsection of Gowanus—largely disappeared by the turn of the century due to various factors, including deindustrialization, ensuing gentrification and suburbanization among more affluent Dominicans and Puerto Ricans. A Panamanian enclave exists in Crown Heights.

====Russian and Ukrainian American====

Brooklyn is also home to many Russians and Ukrainians, who are mainly concentrated in the areas of Brighton Beach and Sheepshead Bay. Brighton Beach features many Russian and Ukrainian businesses and has been nicknamed &quot;Little Russia&quot; and &quot;Little Odessa&quot;, respectively. In the 1970s, Soviet Jews won the right to immigrate, and many ended up in Brighton Beach. In recent years, the non-Jewish Russian and Ukrainian communities of Brighton Beach have grown, and the area is now home to a diverse collection of immigrants from across the former USSR. Smaller concentrations of Russian and Ukrainian Americans are scattered elsewhere in south Brooklyn, including Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst, Homecrest, Coney Island, and Mill Basin. A growing community of Uzbek Americans have settled alongside them in recent years due to their ability to speak Russian.

====Polish American====
Brooklyn&#x27;s Polish inhabitants are historically concentrated in Greenpoint, home to Little Poland. Other longstanding settlements in Borough Park and Sunset Park have endured, while more recent immigrants are scattered throughout the southern parts of Brooklyn alongside the Russian and Ukrainian American communities.

====Italian American====

Despite widespread migration to Staten Island and more suburban areas in metropolitan New York throughout the postwar era, notable concentrations of Italian Americans continue to reside in the neighborhoods of Bensonhurst, Dyker Heights, Bay Ridge, Bath Beach and Gravesend. Less perceptible remnants of older communities have persisted in Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens, where the homes of the remaining Italian Americans can often be contrasted with more recent upper middle class residents through the display of small Madonna statues, the retention of plastic-metal stoop awnings and the use of Formstone in house cladding. All of the aforementioned neighborhoods have retained Italian restaurants, bakeries, delicatessens, pizzerias, cafes and social clubs.

====Arab American &amp; Muslim ====
In the early 20th century, many Lebanese and Syrian Christians settled around Atlantic Avenue west of Flatbush Avenue in Boerum Hill; more recently, this area has evolved into a Yemeni commercial district.
More recent, predominantly Muslim Arab immigrants, especially Egyptians and Lebanese, have moved into the southwest portion of Brooklyn, particularly to Bay Ridge, where many Middle Eastern restaurants, hookah lounges, halal grocers, Islamic shops and mosques line the commercial thoroughfares of Fifth and Third Avenues below 86th Street. Brighton Beach is home to a growing Pakistani American community, while Midwood is home to &quot;Little Pakistan&quot; along Coney Island Avenue (recently co-named Muhammad Ali Jinnah Way). Pakistani Independence Day is celebrated every year with parades and parties on Coney Island Avenue. Just to the north, Kensington is one of New York&#x27;s several emerging Bangladeshi enclaves.

====Irish American====
Third-, fourth- and fifth-generation Irish Americans can be found throughout Brooklyn, with moderate concentrations enduring in the neighborhoods of Windsor Terrace, Park Slope, Bay Ridge, Marine Park and Gerritsen Beach. Historical communities also existed in Vinegar Hill and other waterfront industrial neighborhoods, such as Greenpoint and Sunset Park. Paralleling the Italian American community, many moved to Staten Island and suburban areas in the postwar era. Those that stayed engendered close-knit, stable working-to-middle class communities through employment in the civil service (especially in law enforcement, transportation, and the New York City Fire Department) and the building and construction trades, while others were subsumed by the professional-managerial class and largely shed the Irish American community&#x27;s distinct cultural traditions (including continued worship in the Catholic Church and other social activities, such as Irish stepdance and frequenting Irish American bars).

====South Asian American====
While not as extensive as the Indian American population in Queens, younger professionals of Asian Indian origin are finding Brooklyn to be a convenient alternative to Manhattan to find housing. Nearly 30,000 
Indian Americans call Brooklyn home.

Brighton Beach is home to a growing Pakistani American community, while Midwood is home to Little Pakistan along Coney Island Avenue recently renamed Muhammad Ali Jinnah way. Pakistan Independence Day is celebrated every year with parades and parties on Coney Island Avenue.
Just to the north, Kensington is one of New York&#x27;s several emerging Bangladeshi enclaves.

====Greek American====
Brooklyn&#x27;s Greek Americans live throughout the borough. A historical concentration has endured in Bay Ridge and adjacent areas, where there is a noticeable cluster of Hellenic-focused schools, businesses and cultural institutions. Other businesses are situated in Downtown Brooklyn near Atlantic Avenue. As in much of the New York metropolitan area, Greek-owned diners are found throughout the borough.

====LGBTQ community====

Brooklyn is home to a large and growing number of same-sex couples. Same-sex marriages in New York were legalized on June 24, 2011, and were authorized to take place beginning 30 days thereafter. The Park Slope neighborhood spearheaded the popularity of Brooklyn among lesbians, and Prospect Heights has an LGBT residential presence. Numerous neighborhoods have since become home to LGBT communities. Brooklyn Liberation March, the largest transgender-rights demonstration in LGBTQ history, took place on June 14, 2020, stretching from Grand Army Plaza to Fort Greene, focused on supporting Black transgender lives, drawing an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 participants.

====Artists-in-residence====
Brooklyn became a preferred site for artists and hipsters to set up live/work spaces after being priced out of the same types of living arrangements in Manhattan. Various neighborhoods in Brooklyn, including Williamsburg, DUMBO, Red Hook, and Park Slope evolved as popular neighborhoods for artists-in-residence. However, rents and costs of living have since increased dramatically in these same neighborhoods, forcing artists to move to somewhat less expensive neighborhoods in Brooklyn or across Upper New York Bay to locales in New Jersey, such as Jersey City or Hoboken.

==Demographics==
 
At the 2020 census, 2,736,074 people lived in Brooklyn. The United States Census Bureau had estimated Brooklyn&#x27;s population increased by 2.2% to 2,559,903 between 2010 and 2019. Brooklyn&#x27;s estimated population represented 30.7% of New York City&#x27;s estimated population of 8,336,817; 33.5% of Long Island&#x27;s population of 7,701,172; and 13.2% of New York State&#x27;s population of 19,542,209. In 2020, the government of New York City projected Brooklyn&#x27;s population at 2,648,403. The 2019 census estimates determined there were 958,567 households with an average of 2.66 persons per household. There were 1,065,399 housing units in 2019 and a median gross rent of $1,426. Citing growth, Brooklyn gained 9,696 building permits at the 2019 census estimates program.

===Ethnic groups===
The 2020 American Community Survey estimated the racial and ethnic makeup of Brooklyn was 35.4% non-Hispanic white, 26.7% Black or African American, 0.9% American Indian or Alaska Native, 13.6% Asian, 0.1% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, 4.1% two or more races, and 18.9% Hispanic or Latin American of any race. According to the 2010 United States census, Brooklyn&#x27;s population was 42.8% White, including 35.7% non-Hispanic White; 34.3% Black, including 31.9% non-Hispanic black; 10.5% Asian; 0.5% Native American; 0.0% (rounded) Pacific Islander; 3.0% Multiracial American; and 8.8% from other races. Hispanics and Latinos made up 19.8% of Brooklyn&#x27;s population. In 2010, Brooklyn had some neighborhoods segregated based on race, ethnicity, and religion. Overall, the southwest half of Brooklyn is racially mixed although it contains few black residents; the northeast section is mostly black and Hispanic/Latino.

===Languages===
Brooklyn has a high degree of linguistic diversity. As of 2010, 54.1% (1,240,416) of Brooklyn residents ages 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 17.2% (393,340) spoke Spanish, 6.5% (148,012) Chinese, 5.3% (121,607) Russian, 3.5% (79,469) Yiddish, 2.8% (63,019) French Creole, 1.4% (31,004) Italian, 1.2% (27,440) Hebrew, 1.0% (23,207) Polish, 1.0% (22,763) French, 1.0% (21,773) Arabic, 0.9% (19,388) various Indic languages, 0.7% (15,936) Urdu, and African languages were spoken as a main language by 0.5% (12,305) of the population over the age of five. In total, 45.9% (1,051,456) of Brooklyn&#x27;s population ages 5 and older spoke a mother tongue other than English.

==Culture==

Brooklyn has played a major role in various aspects of American culture, including literature, cinema, and theater. Brooklyn&#x27;s accent has often been portrayed as &quot;the typical New Yorker accent&quot; in American media, although this accent and its stereotypes are supposedly diminishing in currency. Brooklyn&#x27;s official colors are blue and gold.

===Cultural venues===
Brooklyn hosts the world-renowned Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Brooklyn Philharmonic, and the second-largest public art collection in the United States, housed in the Brooklyn Museum.

The Brooklyn Museum, opened in 1897, is New York City&#x27;s second-largest public art museum. It has in its permanent collection more than 1.5 million objects, from ancient Egyptian masterpieces to contemporary art. The Brooklyn Children&#x27;s Museum, the world&#x27;s first museum dedicated to children, opened in December 1899. The only such New York State institution accredited by the American Alliance of Museums, it is one of the few globally to have a permanent collectionover 30,000 cultural objects and natural history specimens.

The Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) includes a 2,109-seat opera house, an 874-seat theater, and the art-house BAM Rose Cinemas. Bargemusic and St. Ann&#x27;s Warehouse are on the other side of Downtown Brooklyn in the DUMBO arts district. Brooklyn Technical High School has the second-largest auditorium in New York City (after Radio City Music Hall), with a seating capacity of over 3,000.

===Media===
====Local periodicals====
Brooklyn has several local newspapers: The &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot;, &quot;Bay Currents&quot; (Oceanfront Brooklyn), &quot;Brooklyn View&quot;, &quot;The Brooklyn Paper&quot;, and Courier-Life Publications. Courier-Life Publications, owned by Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation, is Brooklyn&#x27;s largest chain of newspapers. Brooklyn is also served by the major New York dailies, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, and the &quot;New York Post&quot;. Several others are now defunct, including the &quot;Brooklyn Union&quot; (1867–1937),&lt;ref name=&quot;nysl.nysed.gov/nysnp/all/424&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brooklyn-union/12381&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the &quot;Brooklyn Times&quot;.

The borough is home to the arts and politics monthly &quot;Brooklyn Rail&quot;, as well as the arts and cultural quarterly &quot;Cabinet&quot;. &quot;Hello Mr.&quot; is also published in Brooklyn.

&quot;Brooklyn Magazine&quot; is one of the few glossy magazines about Brooklyn. Several others are now defunct, including &quot;BKLYN Magazine&quot; (a bimonthly lifestyle book owned by Joseph McCarthy, that saw itself as a vehicle for high-end advertisers in Manhattan and was mailed to 80,000 high-income households), &quot;Brooklyn Bridge Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Brooklynite&quot; (a free, glossy quarterly edited by Daniel Treiman), and &quot;NRG&quot; (edited by Gail Johnson and originally marketed as a local periodical for Clinton Hill and Fort Greene, but expanded in scope to become the self-proclaimed &quot;Pulse of Brooklyn&quot; and then the &quot;Pulse of New York&quot;).

====Ethnic press====
Brooklyn has a thriving ethnic press. &quot;El Diario La Prensa&quot;, the largest and oldest Spanish-language daily newspaper in the United States, maintains its corporate headquarters at 1 MetroTech Center in downtown Brooklyn. Major ethnic publications include the Brooklyn–Queens Catholic paper &quot;The Tablet&quot;, &quot;Hamodia&quot;, an Orthodox Jewish daily, and &quot;The Jewish Press&quot;, an Orthodox Jewish weekly. Many nationally distributed ethnic newspapers are based in Brooklyn. Over 60 ethnic groups, writing in 42 languages, publish some 300 non-English language magazines and newspapers in New York City. Among them is the quarterly &quot;L&#x27;Idea&quot;, a bilingual magazine printed in Italian and English since 1974. In addition, many newspapers published abroad, such as &quot;The Daily Gleaner&quot; and &quot;The Star&quot; of Jamaica, are available in Brooklyn. &quot;Our Time Press&quot;, published weekly by DBG Media, covers the Village of Brooklyn with a motto of &quot;The Local Paper with the Global View&quot;.

====Television====
The City of New York has an official television station, run by NYC Media, which features programming based in Brooklyn. Brooklyn Community Access Television is the borough&#x27;s public access channel. Its studios are at the BRIC Arts Media venue, called BRIC House, located on Fulton Street in the Fort Greene section of the borough.

===Events===
* The annual Coney Island Mermaid Parade (mid-to-late June) is a costume-and-float parade.
* Coney Island also hosts the annual Nathan&#x27;s Hot Dog Eating Contest (July 4).
* The annual Labor Day Carnival (also known as the Labor Day Parade or West Indian Day Parade) takes place along Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights.
* The Art of Brooklyn Film Festival runs annually around the second week of June.

==Economy==

Brooklyn&#x27;s job market is driven by three main factors: the performance of the national and city economy, population flows and the borough&#x27;s position as a convenient back office for New York&#x27;s businesses.

Forty-four percent of Brooklyn&#x27;s employed population, or 410,000 people, work in the borough; more than half of the borough&#x27;s residents work outside its boundaries. As a result, economic conditions in Manhattan are important to the borough&#x27;s jobseekers. Strong international immigration to Brooklyn generates jobs in services, retailing and construction.

Since the late 20th century, Brooklyn has benefited from a steady influx of financial back office operations from Manhattan, the rapid growth of a high-tech and entertainment economy in DUMBO, and strong growth in support services such as accounting, personal supply agencies, and computer services firms.

Jobs in the borough have traditionally been concentrated in manufacturing, but since 1975, Brooklyn has shifted from a manufacturing-based to a service-based economy. In 2004, 215,000 Brooklyn residents worked in the services sector, while 27,500 worked in manufacturing. Although manufacturing has declined, a substantial base has remained in apparel and niche manufacturing concerns such as furniture, fabricated metals, and food products. The pharmaceutical company Pfizer was founded in Brooklyn in 1869 and had a manufacturing plant in the borough for many years that employed thousands of workers, but the plant shut down in 2008. However, new light-manufacturing concerns in packaging organic and high-end food have sprung up in the old plant.

First established as a shipbuilding facility in 1801, the Brooklyn Navy Yard employed 70,000 people at its peak during World War II and was then the largest employer in the borough. The &quot;Missouri&quot;, the ship on which the Japanese formally surrendered, was built there, as was the &quot;Maine&quot;, whose sinking off Havana led to the start of the Spanish–American War. The iron-sided Civil War vessel the &quot;Monitor&quot; was built in Greenpoint. From 1968 to 1979 Seatrain Shipbuilding was the major employer. Later tenants include industrial design firms, food processing businesses, artisans, and the film and television production industry. About 230 private-sector firms providing 4,000 jobs are at the Yard.

Construction and services are the fastest-growing sectors. Most employers in Brooklyn are small businesses. In 2000, 91% of the approximately 38,704 business establishments in Brooklyn had fewer than 20 employees. , the borough&#x27;s unemployment rate was 5.9%.

Brooklyn is also home to many banks and credit unions. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, there were 37 banks and 26 credit unions operating in the borough in 2010.

The rezoning of Downtown Brooklyn has generated over US$10 billion of private investment and $300 million in public improvements since 2004. Brooklyn is also attracting numerous high technology start-up companies, as Silicon Alley, the metonym for New York City&#x27;s entrepreneurship ecosystem, has expanded from Lower Manhattan into Brooklyn.

==Parks and other attractions==

* Brooklyn Botanic Garden: adjacent to Prospect Park is the botanical garden, which includes a cherry tree esplanade, a one-acre (0.4 ha) rose garden, a Japanese hill, and pond garden, a fragrance garden, a water lily pond esplanade, several conservatories, a rock garden, a native flora garden, a &quot;bonsai&quot; tree collection, and children&#x27;s gardens and discovery exhibits.
* Coney Island developed as a playground for the rich in the early 1900s, but it grew as one of America&#x27;s first amusement grounds and attracted crowds from all over New York. The Cyclone rollercoaster, built-in 1927, is on the National Register of Historic Places. The 1920 Wonder Wheel and other rides are still operational. Coney Island went into decline in the 1970s but has undergone a renaissance.
* Floyd Bennett Field: the first municipal airport in New York City and long-closed for operations, is now part of the National Park System. Many of the historic hangars and runways are still extant. Nature trails and diverse habitats are found within the park, including salt marsh and a restored area of shortgrass prairie that was once widespread on the Hempstead Plains.
* Green-Wood Cemetery, founded by the social reformer Henry Evelyn Pierrepont in 1838, is an early Rural cemetery. It is the burial ground of many notable New Yorkers.
* Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge: a unique Federal wildlife refuge straddling the Brooklyn–Queens border, part of Gateway National Recreation Area
* New York Transit Museum displays historical artifacts of Greater New York&#x27;s subway, commuter rail, and bus systems; it is at Court Street, a former Independent Subway System station in Brooklyn Heights on the Fulton Street Line.
* Prospect Park is a public park in central Brooklyn encompassing . The park was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, who created Manhattan&#x27;s Central Park. Attractions include the Long Meadow, a meadow, the Picnic House, which houses offices and a hall that can accommodate parties with up to 175 guests; Litchfield Villa, Prospect Park Zoo, the Boathouse, housing a visitors center and the first urban Audubon Center; Brooklyn&#x27;s only lake, covering ; the Prospect Park Bandshell that hosts free outdoor concerts in the summertime; and various sports and fitness activities including seven baseball fields. Prospect Park hosts a popular annual Halloween Parade.
* Fort Greene Park is a public park in the Fort Greene Neighborhood. The park contains the Prison Ship Martyrs&#x27; Monument, a monument to American prisoners during the Revolutionary War.
===Sports===
Brooklyn&#x27;s major professional sports team is the NBA&#x27;s Brooklyn Nets. The Nets moved into the borough in 2012, and play their home games at Barclays Center in Prospect Heights. Previously, the Nets had played in Uniondale, New York and in New Jersey. In April 2020, the New York Liberty of the WNBA were sold to the Nets&#x27; owners and moved their home venue from Madison Square Garden to the Barclays Center.

Barclays Center was also the home arena for the NHL&#x27;s New York Islanders full-time from 2015 to 2018, then part-time from 2018 to 2020 (alternating with Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale). The Islanders had originally played at Nassau Coliseum full-time since their inception until 2015 when their lease at the venue expired and the team moved to Barclays Center. In 2020, the team returned to Nassau Coliseum full-time for one season before moving to the UBS Arena in Elmont, New York in 2021.

Brooklyn also has a storied sports history. It has been home to many famous sports figures such as Joe Paterno, Vince Lombardi, Mike Tyson, Zab Judah, Joe Torre, Sandy Koufax, Billy Cunningham and Vitas Gerulaitis. Basketball legend Michael Jordan was born in Brooklyn though he grew up in Wilmington, North Carolina.

In the earliest days of organized baseball, Brooklyn teams dominated the new game. The second recorded game of baseball was played near what is now Fort Greene Park on October 24, 1845. Brooklyn&#x27;s Excelsiors, Atlantics and Eckfords were the leading teams from the mid-1850s through the Civil War, and there were dozens of local teams with neighborhood league play, such as at Mapleton Oval. During this &quot;Brooklyn era&quot;, baseball evolved into the modern game: the first fastball, first changeup, first batting average, first triple play, first pro baseball player, first enclosed ballpark, first scorecard, first known African-American team, first black championship game, first road trip, first gambling scandal, and first eight pennant winners were all in or from Brooklyn.

Brooklyn&#x27;s most famous historical team, the Brooklyn Dodgers, named for &quot;trolley dodgers&quot; played at Ebbets Field. In 1947 Jackie Robinson was hired by the Dodgers as the first African-American player in Major League Baseball in the modern era. In 1955, the Dodgers, perennial National League pennant winners, won the only World Series for Brooklyn against their rival New York Yankees. The event was marked by mass euphoria and celebrations. Just two years later, the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles. Walter O&#x27;Malley, the team&#x27;s owner at the time, is still vilified, even by Brooklynites too young to remember the Dodgers as Brooklyn&#x27;s ball club.

After a 43-year hiatus, professional baseball returned to the borough in 2001 with the Brooklyn Cyclones, a minor league team that plays in MCU Park in Coney Island. They are an affiliate of the New York Mets.

The minor-league New York Cosmos soccer club played its home games at MCU Park in 2017. A new Brooklyn FC will begin play in 2024, fielding a women&#x27;s team in the first-division USL Super League and a men&#x27;s team in the second-division USL Championship beginning in 2025.

Brooklyn once had a National Football League team named the Brooklyn Lions in 1926, who played at Ebbets Field.

In rugby union, Rugby United New York joined Major League Rugby in 2019 and played their home games at MCU Park through the 2021 season.

Brooklyn has one of the most active recreational fishing fleets in the United States. In addition to a large private fleet along Jamaica Bay, there is a substantial public fleet within Sheepshead Bay. Species caught include Black Fish, Porgy, Striped Bass, Black Sea Bass, Fluke, and Flounder.

==Government and politics==
Each of New York City&#x27;s five counties (coterminous with each borough) has its own criminal court system and District Attorney, the chief public prosecutor who is directly elected by popular vote.

==Housing==
Brooklyn offers a wide array of private housing, as well as public housing, which is administered by the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA). Affordable rental and co-operative housing units throughout the borough were created under the Mitchell–Lama Housing Program. There were 1,101,441 housing units in 2022 at an average density of . Public housing administered by NYCHA accounts for more than 100,000 residents in nearly 50,000 units in 2023.

==Education==

Education in Brooklyn is provided by a vast number of public and private institutions. Non-charter public schools in the borough are managed by the New York City Department of Education, the largest public school system in the United States.

Brooklyn Technical High School (commonly called Brooklyn Tech), a New York City public high school, is the largest specialized high school for science, mathematics, and technology in the United States. Brooklyn Tech opened in 1922. Brooklyn Tech is across the street from Fort Greene Park. This high school was built from 1930 to 1933 at a cost of about $6 million and is 12 stories high. It covers about half of a city block. Brooklyn Tech is noted for its famous alumni (including two Nobel Laureates), its academics, and a large number of graduates attending prestigious universities.

===Higher education===
====Public colleges====
Brooklyn College is a senior college of the City University of New York, and was the first public coeducational liberal arts college in New York City. The college ranked in the top 10 nationally for the second consecutive year in Princeton Review&#x27;s 2006 guidebook, &quot;America&#x27;s Best Value Colleges&quot;. Many of its students are first and second-generation Americans. Founded in 1970, Medgar Evers College is a senior college of the City University of New York. The college offers programs at the baccalaureate and associate degree levels, as well as adult and continuing education classes for central Brooklyn residents, corporations, government agencies, and community organizations. Medgar Evers College is a few blocks east of Prospect Park in Crown Heights.

CUNY&#x27;s New York City College of Technology (City Tech) of The City University of New York (CUNY) (Downtown Brooklyn/Brooklyn Heights) is the largest public college of technology in New York State and a national model for technological education. Established in 1946, City Tech can trace its roots to 1881 when the Technical Schools of the Metropolitan Museum of Art were renamed the New York Trade School. That institution—which became the Voorhees Technical Institute many decades later—was soon a model for the development of technical and vocational schools worldwide. In 1971, Voorhees was incorporated into City Tech.

SUNY Downstate College of Medicine, founded as the Long Island College Hospital in 1860, is the oldest hospital-based medical school in the United States. The Medical Center comprises the College of Medicine, College of Health Related Professions, College of Nursing, School of Public Health, School of Graduate Studies, and University Hospital of Brooklyn. The Nobel Prize winner Robert F. Furchgott was a member of its faculty. Half of the Medical Center&#x27;s students are minorities or immigrants. The College of Medicine has the highest percentage of minority students of any medical school in New York State.

====Private colleges====
Adelphi University, based in Garden City, moved its Manhattan Campus in 2023 to a new location on Livingston Street in Downtown Brooklyn. The move marks a return to Brooklyn for the university, which originated on Adelphi Street with the Adelphi Academy. The facility is shared with St. Francis College, which has created a new campus at 179 Livingston Street.

Brooklyn Law School was founded in 1901 and is notable for its diverse student body. Women and African Americans were enrolled in 1909. According to the Leiter Report, a compendium of law school rankings published by Brian Leiter, Brooklyn Law School places 31st nationally for the quality of students.

Long Island University is a private university headquartered in Brookville on Long Island, with a campus in Downtown Brooklyn with 6,417 undergraduate students. The Brooklyn campus has strong science and medical technology programs, at the graduate and undergraduate levels.

Pratt Institute, in Clinton Hill, is a private college founded in 1887 with programs in engineering, architecture, and the arts. Some buildings in the school&#x27;s Brooklyn campus are official landmarks. Pratt has over 4700 students, with most at its Brooklyn campus. Graduate programs include a library and information science, architecture, and urban planning. Undergraduate programs include architecture, construction management, writing, critical and visual studies, industrial design and fine arts, totaling over 25 programs in all.

The New York University Tandon School of Engineering, the United States&#x27; second oldest private institute of technology, founded in 1854, has its main campus in Downtown&#x27;s MetroTech Center, a commercial, civic and educational redevelopment project of which it was a key sponsor. NYU-Tandon is one of the 18 schools and colleges that comprise New York University (NYU).

St. Francis College is a Catholic college in Downtown Brooklyn founded in 1859 by Franciscan friars. Over 2,400 students attend the small liberal arts college. St. Francis is considered by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as one of the more diverse colleges, and was ranked one of the best baccalaureate colleges by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine and &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

Brooklyn also has smaller liberal arts institutions, such as Saint Joseph&#x27;s College in Clinton Hill and Boricua College in Williamsburg.

====Community colleges====
Kingsborough Community College is a junior college in the City University of New York system in Manhattan Beach.

==Brooklyn Public Library==

As an independent system, separate from the New York and Queens public library systems, the Brooklyn Public Library offers thousands of public programs, millions of books, and use of more than 850 free Internet-accessible computers. It also has books and periodicals in all the major languages spoken in Brooklyn, including English, Russian, Chinese, Spanish, Hebrew, and Haitian Creole, as well as French, Yiddish, Hindi, Bengali, Polish, Italian, and Arabic. The Central Library is a landmarked building facing Grand Army Plaza.

There are 58 library branches, placing one within a half-mile of each Brooklyn resident. In addition to its specialized Business Library in Brooklyn Heights, the Library is preparing to construct its new Visual &amp; Performing Arts Library (VPA) in the BAM Cultural District, which will focus on the link between new and emerging arts and technology and house traditional and digital collections. It will provide access and training to arts applications and technologies not widely available to the public. The collections will include the subjects of art, theater, dance, music, film, photography, and architecture. A special archive will house the records and history of Brooklyn&#x27;s arts communities.

==Transportation==
===Public transport===

About 57 percent of all households in Brooklyn were households without automobiles. The citywide rate is 55 percent in New York City.


Brooklyn features extensive public transit. Nineteen New York City Subway services, including the Franklin Avenue Shuttle, traverse the borough. Approximately 92.8% of Brooklyn residents traveling to Manhattan use the subway, despite the fact some neighborhoods like Flatlands and Marine Park are poorly served by subway service. Major stations, out of the 170 currently in Brooklyn, include:
* Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center
* Broadway Junction
* DeKalb Avenue
* Jay Street–MetroTech
* Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue
Proposed New York City Subway lines never built include a line along Nostrand or Utica Avenues to Marine Park, as well as a subway line to Spring Creek.

Brooklyn was once served by an extensive network of streetcars, but many were replaced by the public bus network that covers the entire borough. There is also daily express bus service into Manhattan. New York&#x27;s famous yellow cabs also provide transportation in Brooklyn, although they are less numerous in the borough. There are three commuter rail stations in Brooklyn: East New York, Nostrand Avenue, and Atlantic Terminal, the terminus of the Atlantic Branch of the Long Island Rail Road. The terminal is near the Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center subway station, with ten connecting subway services.

In February 2015, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city government would begin a citywide ferry service called NYC Ferry to extend ferry transportation to communities in the city that have been traditionally underserved by public transit. The ferry opened in May 2017, with the Bay Ridge ferry serving southwestern Brooklyn and the East River Ferry serving northwestern Brooklyn. A third route, the Rockaway ferry, makes one stop in the borough at Brooklyn Army Terminal.

A streetcar line, the Brooklyn–Queens Connector, was proposed by the city in February 2016, with the planned timeline calling for service to begin around 2024.

===Roadways===


Most of the limited-access expressways and parkways are in the western and southern sections of Brooklyn, where the borough&#x27;s two interstate highways are located; Interstate 278, which uses the Gowanus Expressway and the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway, traverses Sunset Park and Brooklyn Heights, while Interstate 478 is an unsigned route designation for the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel, which connects to Manhattan. Other prominent roadways are the Prospect Expressway (New York State Route 27), the Belt Parkway, and the Jackie Robinson Parkway (formerly the Interborough Parkway). Planned expressways that were never built include the Bushwick Expressway, an extension of I-78 and the Cross-Brooklyn Expressway, I-878. Major thoroughfares include Atlantic Avenue, Fourth Avenue, 86th Street, Kings Highway, Bay Parkway, Ocean Parkway, Eastern Parkway, Linden Boulevard, McGuinness Boulevard, Flatbush Avenue, Pennsylvania Avenue, and Nostrand Avenue.

Much of Brooklyn has only named streets, but Park Slope, Bay Ridge, Sunset Park, Bensonhurst, and Borough Park and the other western sections have numbered streets running approximately northwest to southeast, and numbered avenues going approximately northeast to southwest. East of Dahill Road, lettered avenues (like Avenue M) run east and west, and numbered streets have the prefix &quot;East&quot;. South of Avenue O, related numbered streets west of Dahill Road use the &quot;West&quot; designation. This set of numbered streets ranges from West 37th Street to East 108 Street, and the avenues range from A–Z with names substituted for some of them in some neighborhoods (notably Albemarle, Beverley, Cortelyou, Dorchester, Ditmas, Foster, Farragut, Glenwood, Quentin). Numbered streets prefixed by &quot;North&quot; and &quot;South&quot; in Williamsburg, and &quot;Bay&quot;, &quot;Beach&quot;, &quot;Brighton&quot;, &quot;Plumb&quot;, &quot;Paerdegat&quot; or &quot;Flatlands&quot; along the southern and southwestern waterfront are loosely based on the old grids of the original towns of Kings County that eventually consolidated to form Brooklyn. These names often reflect the bodies of water or beaches around them, such as Plumb Beach or Paerdegat Basin.

Brooklyn is connected to Manhattan by three bridges, the Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Williamsburg Bridge; a vehicular tunnel, the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel (also known as the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel); and several subway tunnels. The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge links Brooklyn with the more suburban borough of Staten Island. Though much of its border is on land, Brooklyn shares several water crossings with Queens, including the Pulaski Bridge, the Greenpoint Avenue Bridge, the Kosciuszko Bridge (part of the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway), and the Grand Street Bridge, all of which carry traffic over Newtown Creek, and the Marine Parkway Bridge connecting Brooklyn to the Rockaway Peninsula.

===Waterways===
Brooklyn was long a major shipping port, especially at the Brooklyn Army Terminal and Bush Terminal in Sunset Park. Most container ship cargo operations have shifted to the New Jersey side of New York Harbor, while the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal in Red Hook is a focal point for New York&#x27;s growing cruise industry. The &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot;, one of the world&#x27;s largest ocean liners, was designed specifically to fit under the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, the longest suspension bridge in the United States. She makes regular ports of call at the Red Hook terminal on her transatlantic crossings from Southampton, England. The Brooklyn waterfront formerly employed tens of thousands of borough residents and acted as an incubator for industries across the entire city, and the decline of the port exacerbated Brooklyn&#x27;s decline in the second half of the 20th century.

In February 2015, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city government would begin NYC Ferry to extend ferry transportation to traditionally underserved communities in the city. The ferry opened in May 2017, offering commuter services from the western shore of Brooklyn to Manhattan via three routes. The East River Ferry serves points in Lower Manhattan, Midtown, Long Island City, and northwestern Brooklyn via its East River route. The South Brooklyn and Rockaway routes serve southwestern Brooklyn before terminating in lower Manhattan. Ferries to Coney Island are also planned. NY Waterway offers tours and charters. SeaStreak also offers a weekday ferry service between the Brooklyn Army Terminal and the Manhattan ferry slips at Pier 11/Wall Street downtown and East 34th Street Ferry Landing in midtown. A Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel, originally proposed in the 1920s as a core project for the then-new Port Authority of New York is again being studied and discussed as a way to ease freight movements across a large swath of the metropolitan area.

<text>Year 308 ([[Roman numerals|CCCVIII]]) was a leap year starting on Thursday of the Julian calendar. It was known in the Roman Empire as the Year of the Consulship of Diocletian and (Galerius) Maximianus (or, less frequently, year 1061 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 308 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==

* April: In Rome, Emperor Maximian attempts to depose his son Maxentius, but the soldiers in Rome side with Maxentius and force Maximian to flee to the court of Constantine I.
* The overthrow of Maximian prompts the soldiers of Roman Africa to prop up the vicarius of Africa, Domitius Alexander, as a usurper.
* Constantine raids the territory of the Bructeri and builds a bridge across the Rhine at Cologne.
* November 11 – The Conference of Carnuntum: Attempting to keep peace within the Roman Empire, Galerius recalls Diocletian briefly from retirement, and they convene with Maximian.

Licinius is proclaimed Augustus of the west, while rival contender Constantine I is again declared Caesar.
* Bereft of his father&#x27;s support, Maxentius increasingly presents himself as the &quot;Conservator Urbis Suae&quot; (Preserver of His Own City). Construction of the Basilica of Maxentius (or Basilica Nova), the largest building in the Roman Forum, is begun.

<text>William III (William Henry; ; 4 November 1650 – 8 March 1702), also known as William of Orange, was the sovereign Prince of Orange from birth, Stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Guelders, and Overijssel in the Dutch Republic from 1672, and King of England, Ireland, and Scotland from 1689 until his death in 1702. He ruled Great Britain and Ireland with his wife, Queen Mary II, and their joint reign is known as that of William and Mary.

William was the only child of William II, Prince of Orange, and Mary, Princess Royal, the daughter of King Charles I of England, Scotland, and Ireland. His father died a week before his birth, making William III the prince of Orange from birth. In 1677, he married his first cousin Mary, the elder daughter of his maternal uncle James, Duke of York, the younger brother and later successor of King Charles II.

A Protestant, William participated in several wars against the powerful Catholic French ruler Louis XIV in coalition with both Protestant and Catholic powers in Europe. Many Protestants heralded William as a champion of their faith. In 1685, his Catholic uncle and father-in-law, James, became king of England, Scotland, and Ireland. James&#x27;s reign was unpopular with Protestants in the British Isles, who opposed Catholic Emancipation. Supported by a group of influential British political and religious leaders, William invaded England in what became known as the Glorious Revolution. In 1688, he landed at the south-western English port of Brixham; James was deposed shortly afterward.

William&#x27;s reputation as a staunch Protestant enabled him and his wife to take power. During the early years of his reign, William was occupied abroad with the Nine Years&#x27; War (1688–1697), leaving Mary to govern Britain alone. She died in 1694. In 1696 the Jacobites, a faction loyal to the deposed James, plotted unsuccessfully to assassinate William and restore James to the throne. In Scotland, William&#x27;s role in ordering the Massacre of Glencoe remains notorious. William&#x27;s lack of children and the death in 1700 of his nephew the Duke of Gloucester, the son of his sister-in-law Anne, threatened the Protestant succession. The danger was averted by placing William and Mary&#x27;s cousins, the Protestant Hanoverians, in line to the throne after Anne with the Act of Settlement 1701. Upon his death in 1702, William was succeeded in Britain by Anne and as titular Prince of Orange by his cousin John William Friso.

==Early life==

===Birth and family===
William III was born in The Hague in the Dutch Republic on 4 November 1650. Baptised William Henry (), he was the only child of Mary, Princess Royal, and &quot;stadtholder&quot; William II, Prince of Orange. Mary was the elder daughter of King Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland and sister of kings Charles II and James II and VII.

Eight days before William was born, his father died of smallpox; thus, William was the sovereign Prince of Orange from the moment of his birth. Immediately, a conflict arose between his mother and his paternal grandmother, Amalia of Solms-Braunfels, over the name to be given to the infant. Mary wanted to name him Charles after her brother, but her mother-in-law insisted on giving him the name William (&quot;Willem&quot;) to bolster his prospects of becoming &quot;stadtholder&quot;. William II had intended to appoint his wife as their son&#x27;s guardian in his will; however, the document remained unsigned at William II&#x27;s death and was therefore void. On 13 August 1651, the &quot;Hoge Raad van Holland en Zeeland&quot; (Supreme Court) ruled that guardianship would be shared between his mother, his grandmother and Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, husband of his paternal aunt Louise Henriette.

===Childhood and education===
William&#x27;s mother showed little personal interest in her son, sometimes being absent for years, and had always deliberately kept herself apart from Dutch society. William&#x27;s education was first laid in the hands of several Dutch governesses, some of English descent, including Walburg Howard and the Scottish noblewoman Lady Anna Mackenzie. From April 1656, the prince received daily instruction in the Reformed religion from the Calvinist preacher Cornelis Trigland, a follower of the Contra-Remonstrant theologian Gisbertus Voetius.

The ideal education for William was described in &quot;Discours sur la nourriture de S. H. Monseigneur le Prince d&#x27;Orange&quot;, a short treatise, perhaps by one of William&#x27;s tutors, Constantijn Huygens. In these lessons, the prince was taught that he was predestined to become an instrument of Divine Providence, fulfilling the historical destiny of the House of Orange-Nassau. William was seen, despite his youth, as the leader of the &quot;Orangist&quot; party, heir to the stadholderships of several provinces and the office of Captain-General of the Union (see Politics and government of the Dutch Republic). He was viewed as the leader of the nation in its independence movement and its protector from foreign threats. This was in the tradition of the princes of Orange before him: his great-grandfather William the Silent, his grand-uncle Maurice, his grandfather Frederick Henry, and his father William II.

From early 1659, William spent seven years at the University of Leiden for a formal education, under the guidance of ethics professor Hendrik Bornius (though never officially enrolling as a student). While residing in the &quot;Prinsenhof&quot; at Delft, William had a small personal retinue including Hans Willem Bentinck, and a new governor, Frederick Nassau de Zuylenstein, who (as an illegitimate son of stadtholder Frederick Henry of Orange) was his paternal uncle.

Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt and his uncle Cornelis de Graeff pushed the States of Holland to take charge of William&#x27;s education and ensure that he would acquire the skills to serve in a future—though undetermined—state function; the States acted on 25 September 1660. Around this time, the young prince played with De Graeff&#x27;s sons Pieter and Jacob de Graeff in the park of the country house in Soestdijk. In 1674 Wilhelm bought the estate from Jacob de Graeff, which was later converted into Soestdijk Palace. This first involvement of the authorities did not last long. On 23 December 1660, when William was ten years old, his mother died of smallpox at Whitehall Palace, London, while visiting her brother, the recently restored King Charles II. In her will, Mary requested that Charles look after William&#x27;s interests, and Charles now demanded that the States of Holland end their interference. To appease Charles, they complied on 30 September 1661. That year, Zuylenstein began to work for Charles and induced William to write letters to his uncle asking him to help William become stadtholder someday. After his mother&#x27;s death, William&#x27;s education and guardianship became a point of contention between his dynasty&#x27;s supporters and the advocates of a more republican Netherlands.

The Dutch authorities did their best at first to ignore these intrigues, but in the Second Anglo-Dutch War, one of Charles&#x27;s peace conditions was the improvement of the position of his nephew. As a countermeasure in 1666, when William was sixteen, the States officially made him a ward of the government, or a &quot;Child of State&quot;. All pro-English courtiers, including Zuylenstein, were removed from William&#x27;s company. William begged De Witt to allow Zuylenstein to stay, but he refused. De Witt, the leading politician of the Republic, took William&#x27;s education into his own hands, instructing him weekly in state matters and joining him for regular games of real tennis.

==Early offices==
===Exclusion from stadtholdership===

After the death of William&#x27;s father, most provinces had left the office of stadtholder vacant. At the demand of Oliver Cromwell, the Treaty of Westminster, which ended the First Anglo-Dutch War, had a secret annexe that required the Act of Seclusion, which forbade the province of Holland from appointing a member of the House of Orange as stadtholder. After the English Restoration, the Act of Seclusion, which had not remained a secret for long, was declared void as the English Commonwealth (with which the treaty had been concluded) no longer existed. In 1660, William&#x27;s mother Mary and grandmother Amalia tried to persuade several provincial States to designate William as their future stadtholder, but they all initially refused.

In 1667, as William III approached the age of 18, the Orangist party again attempted to bring him to power by securing for him the offices of stadtholder and Captain-General. To prevent the restoration of the influence of the House of Orange, De Witt, the leader of the States Party, allowed the pensionary of Haarlem, Gaspar Fagel, to induce the States of Holland to issue the Perpetual Edict. The Edict, supported by the important Amsterdam politicians Andries de Graeff and Gillis Valckenier, declared that the Captain-General or Admiral-General of the Netherlands could not serve as stadtholder in any province. Even so, William&#x27;s supporters sought ways to enhance his prestige and, on 19 September 1668, the States of Zeeland appointed him as &quot;First Noble&quot;. To receive this honour, William had to escape the attention of his state tutors and travel secretly to Middelburg. A month later, Amalia allowed William to manage his own household and declared him to be of majority age.

The province of Holland, the centre of anti-Orangism, abolished the office of stadtholder, and four other provinces followed suit in March 1670, establishing the so-called &quot;Harmony&quot;. De Witt demanded an oath from each Holland regent (city council member) to uphold the Edict; all but one complied. William saw all this as a defeat, but the arrangement was a compromise: De Witt would have preferred to ignore the prince completely, but now his eventual rise to the office of supreme army commander was implicit. De Witt further conceded that William would be admitted as a member of the &quot;Raad van State&quot;, the Council of State, then the generality organ administering the defence budget. William was introduced to the council on 31 May 1670 with full voting rights, despite De Witt&#x27;s attempts to limit his role to that of an advisor.

===Conflict with republicans===
In November 1670, William obtained permission to travel to England to urge Charles to pay back at least a part of the 2,797,859 guilder debt the House of Stuart owed the House of Orange. Charles was unable to pay, but William agreed to reduce the amount owed to 1,800,000 guilders. Charles found his nephew to be a dedicated Calvinist and patriotic Dutchman and reconsidered his desire to show him the Secret Treaty of Dover with France, directed at destroying the Dutch Republic and installing William as &quot;sovereign&quot; of a Dutch rump state. In addition to differing political outlooks, William found that his lifestyle differed from his uncles Charles and James, who were more concerned with drinking, gambling, and cavorting with mistresses.

The following year, the Republic&#x27;s security deteriorated quickly as an Anglo-French attack became imminent. In view of the threat, the States of Gelderland wanted William to be appointed Captain-General of the Dutch States Army as soon as possible, despite his youth and inexperience. On 15 December 1671, the States of Utrecht made this their official policy. On 19 January 1672, the States of Holland made a counterproposal: to appoint William for just a single campaign. The prince refused this and on 25 February a compromise was reached: an appointment by the States General for one summer, followed by a permanent appointment on his 22nd birthday.

Meanwhile, William had written a secret letter to Charles in January 1672 asking his uncle to exploit the situation by exerting pressure on the States to appoint William stadtholder. In return, William would ally the Republic with England and serve Charles&#x27;s interests as much as his &quot;honour and the loyalty due to this state&quot; allowed. Charles took no action on the proposal, and continued his war plans with his French ally.

==Becoming stadtholder==
===&quot;Disaster year&quot; and Franco-Dutch War===

For the Dutch Republic, 1672 proved calamitous. It became known as the &quot;Rampjaar&quot; (&quot;disaster year&quot;) because in the Franco-Dutch War and the Third Anglo-Dutch War, the Netherlands was invaded by France and its allies: England, Münster, and Cologne. Although the Anglo-French fleet was disabled by the Battle of Solebay, in June the French army quickly overran the provinces of Gelderland and Utrecht. On 14 June, William withdrew with the remnants of his field army into Holland, where the States had ordered the flooding of the Dutch Waterline on 8 June. Louis XIV of France, believing the war was over, began negotiations to extract as large a sum of money from the Dutch as possible. The presence of a large French army in the heart of the Republic caused a general panic, and the people turned against De Witt and his allies.

On 4 July, the States of Holland appointed William stadtholder, and he took the oath five days later. The next day, a special envoy from Charles II, Lord Arlington, met William in Nieuwerbrug and presented a proposal from Charles. In return for William&#x27;s capitulation to England and France, Charles would make William Sovereign Prince of Holland, instead of stadtholder (a mere civil servant). When William refused, Arlington threatened that William would witness the end of the Republic&#x27;s existence. William answered famously: &quot;There is one way to avoid this: to die defending it in the last ditch.&quot; On 7 July, the inundations were complete and the further advance of the French army was effectively blocked. On 16 July, Zeeland offered the stadtholdership to William.

Johan de Witt had been unable to function as Grand Pensionary after being wounded by an attempt on his life on 21 June. On 15 August, William published a letter from Charles, in which the English king stated that he had made war because of the aggression of the De Witt faction. The people thus incited, De Witt and his brother, Cornelis, were brutally murdered by an Orangist civil militia in The Hague on 20 August. Subsequently, William replaced many of the Dutch regents with his followers.

Though William&#x27;s complicity in the lynching has never been proved (and some 19th-century Dutch historians have made an effort to disprove that he was an accessory), he thwarted attempts to prosecute the ringleaders, and even rewarded some, like Hendrik Verhoeff, with money, and others, like Johan van Banchem and Johan Kievit, with high offices. This damaged his reputation in the same fashion as his later actions at Glencoe.

William continued to fight against the invaders from England and France, allying himself with Spain, Brandenburg, and Emperor Leopold I. In November 1672, he took his army to Maastricht to threaten the French supply lines and then attacked Charleroi. In September 1673, the Dutch situation further improved. The resolute defence by John Maurice of Nassau-Siegen and Hans Willem van Aylva in the north of the Dutch Republic finally forced the troops of Münster and Cologne to withdraw, while William crossed the Dutch Waterline and recaptured Naarden. In November, a 30,000-strong Dutch-Spanish army, under William&#x27;s command, marched into the lands of the Bishops of Münster and Cologne. The Dutch troops took revenge and carried out many atrocities. Together with 35,000 Imperial troops, they then captured Bonn, an important magazine in the long logistical lines between France and the Dutch Republic. The French position in the Netherlands became untenable and Louis was forced to evacuate French troops. This deeply shocked Louis and he retreated to Saint Germain where no one, except a few intimates, were allowed to disturb him. The next year only Grave and Maastricht remained in French hands.

Fagel now proposed to treat the liberated provinces of Utrecht, Gelderland and Overijssel as conquered territory (Generality Lands), as punishment for their quick surrender to the enemy. William refused but obtained a special mandate from the States General to appoint all delegates in the States of these provinces anew. William&#x27;s followers in the States of Utrecht on 26 April 1674 appointed him hereditary stadtholder. On 30 January 1675, the States of Gelderland offered him the titles of Duke of Guelders and Count of Zutphen. The negative reactions to this from Zeeland and the city of Amsterdam made William ultimately decide to decline these honours; he was instead appointed stadtholder of Gelderland and Overijssel. Baruch Spinoza&#x27;s warning in his Political Treatise of 1677 of the need to organize the state so that the citizens maintain control over the sovereign was an influential expression of this unease with the concentration of power in one person.

Meanwhile, the front of the war against France had shifted to the Spanish Netherlands. In 1674, Allied forces in the Netherlands were numerically superior to the French army under Condé, which was based along the Piéton river near Charleroi. William took the offensive and sought to bring on a battle by outflanking the French positions but the broken ground forced him to divide his army into three separate columns. At Seneffe, Condé led a cavalry attack against the Allied vanguard and by midday on 11 August had halted their advance. Against the advice of his subordinates, he then ordered a series of frontal assaults which led to very heavy casualties on both sides with no concrete result. William and the Dutch blamed the Imperial commander, de Souches, and after a failed attempt to capture Oudenaarde, largely due to obstructionism from de Souches, he was relieved of command. Frustrated, William joined the army under Rabenhaupt with 10,000 troops instead of campaigning further in the Spanish Netherlands. He assumed command of operations at Grave, which had been besieged since 28 June. Grave surrendered on 27 October. The Dutch were split by internal disputes; the powerful Amsterdam mercantile body was anxious to end an expensive war once their commercial interests were secured, while William saw France as a long-term threat that had to be defeated. This conflict increased once ending the war became a distinct possibility when Grave was captured in October 1674, leaving only Maastricht.

On both sides, the last years of the war saw minimal return for their investment of men and money. The French were preparing a major offensive, however, at the end of 1676. Intended to capture Valenciennes, Cambrai and Saint-Omer in the Spanish Netherlands. Louis believed this would deprive the Dutch regents of the courage to continue the war any longer. In this, however, he was mistaken. The impending French offensive actually led to an intensification of Dutch-Spanish cooperation. Still, the French offensive of 1677 was a success. The Spaniards found it difficult to raise enough troops due to financial constraints and the Allies were defeated in the Battle of Cassel. This meant that they could not prevent the cities from falling into French hands. The French then took a defensive posture, afraid that more success would force England to intervene on the side of the Allies.

The peace talks that began at Nijmegen in 1676 were given a greater sense of urgency in November 1677 when William married his cousin Mary, Charles II of England&#x27;s niece. An Anglo-Dutch defensive alliance followed in March 1678, although English troops did not arrive in significant numbers until late May. Louis seized this opportunity to improve his negotiating position and captured Ypres and Ghent in early March, before signing a peace treaty with the Dutch on 10 August.

The Battle of Saint-Denis was fought three days later on 13 August, when a combined Dutch-Spanish force under William attacked the French army under Luxembourg. Luxembourg withdrew and William thus ensured Mons would remain in Spanish hands. On 19 August, Spain and France agreed an armistice, followed by a formal peace treaty on 17 September. 

The war had seen the rebirth of the Dutch States Army as one of the most disciplined and best-trained European armed forces. This had not been enough to keep France from making conquests in the Spanish Netherlands, which William and the regents blamed mainly on the Spaniards; the Dutch expected the once powerful Spanish Empire to have more military strength.

===Marriage===
During the war with France, William tried to improve his position by marrying, in 1677, his first cousin Mary, elder surviving daughter of the Duke of York, later King James II of England (James VII of Scotland). Mary was eleven years his junior and he anticipated resistance to a Stuart match from the Amsterdam merchants who had disliked his mother (another Mary Stuart), but William believed that marrying Mary would increase his chances of succeeding to Charles&#x27;s kingdoms, and would draw England&#x27;s monarch away from his pro-French policies. James was not inclined to consent, but Charles II pressured his brother to agree. Charles wanted to use the possibility of marriage to gain leverage in negotiations relating to the war, but William insisted that the two issues be decided separately. Charles relented, and Bishop Henry Compton married the couple on 4 November 1677. Mary became pregnant soon after the marriage, but miscarried. After a further illness later in 1678, she never conceived again.

Throughout William and Mary&#x27;s marriage, William had only one reputed mistress, Elizabeth Villiers, in contrast to the many mistresses his uncles openly kept.

===Tensions with France, intrigue with England===
By 1678, Louis XIV sought peace with the Dutch Republic. Even so, tensions remained: William remained suspicious of Louis, thinking that the French king desired &quot;universal kingship&quot; over Europe; Louis described William as &quot;my mortal enemy&quot; and saw him as an obnoxious warmonger. France&#x27;s annexations in the Southern Netherlands and Germany (the &quot;Réunion&quot; policy) and the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, caused a surge of Huguenot refugees to the Republic. This led William III to join various anti-French alliances, such as the Association League, and ultimately the League of Augsburg (an anti-French coalition that also included the Holy Roman Empire, Sweden, Spain and several German states) in 1686.

After his marriage in November 1677, William became a strong candidate for the English throne should his father-in-law (and uncle) James be excluded because of his Catholicism. During the crisis concerning the Exclusion Bill in 1680, Charles at first invited William to come to England to bolster the king&#x27;s position against the exclusionists, then withdrew his invitation—after which Lord Sunderland also tried unsuccessfully to bring William over, but now to put pressure on Charles. Nevertheless, William secretly induced the States General to send Charles the &quot;Insinuation&quot;, a plea beseeching the king to prevent any Catholics from succeeding him, without explicitly naming James. After receiving indignant reactions from Charles and James, William denied any involvement.

In 1685, when James II succeeded Charles, William at first attempted a conciliatory approach, at the same time trying not to offend the Protestants in England. William, ever looking for ways to diminish the power of France, hoped that James would join the League of Augsburg, but by 1687 it became clear that James would not join the anti-French alliance. Relations worsened between William and James thereafter. In November, James&#x27;s second wife, Mary of Modena, was announced to be pregnant. That month, to gain the favour of English Protestants, William wrote an open letter to the English people in which he disapproved of James&#x27;s pro-Roman Catholic policy of religious toleration. Seeing him as a friend, and often having maintained secret contacts with him for years, many English politicians began to urge an armed invasion of England.

==Glorious Revolution==
===Invasion of England===
William at first opposed the prospect of invasion, but most historians now agree that he began to assemble an expeditionary force in April 1688, as it became increasingly clear that France would remain occupied by campaigns in Germany and Italy, and thus unable to mount an attack while William&#x27;s troops would be occupied in Britain. Believing that the English people would not react well to a foreign invader, he demanded in a letter to Rear-Admiral Arthur Herbert that the most eminent English Protestants first invite him to invade. In June, Mary of Modena, after a string of miscarriages, gave birth to a son, James Francis Edward Stuart, who displaced William&#x27;s Protestant wife to become first in the line of succession and raised the prospect of an ongoing Catholic monarchy. Public anger also increased because of the trial of seven bishops who had publicly opposed James&#x27;s Declaration of Indulgence granting religious liberty to his subjects, a policy which appeared to threaten the establishment of the Anglican Church.

On 30 June 1688—the same day the bishops were acquitted—a group of political figures, known afterward as the &quot;Immortal Seven&quot;, sent William a formal invitation. William&#x27;s intentions to invade were public knowledge by September 1688. With a Dutch army, William landed at Brixham in southwest England on 5 November 1688. He came ashore from the ship &quot;Den Briel&quot;, proclaiming &quot;the liberties of England and the Protestant religion I will maintain&quot;. William&#x27;s fleet was vastly larger than the Spanish Armada 100 years earlier: approximately consisting of 463 ships with 40,000 men on board, including 9,500 sailors, 11,000 foot soldiers, 4,000 cavalry and 5,000 English and Huguenot volunteers. James&#x27;s support began to dissolve almost immediately upon William&#x27;s arrival; Protestant officers defected from the English army (the most notable of whom was Lord Churchill of Eyemouth, James&#x27;s most able commander), and influential noblemen across the country declared their support for the invader.

James at first attempted to resist William, but saw that his efforts would prove futile. He sent representatives to negotiate with William, but secretly attempted to flee on 11 December, throwing the Great Seal into the Thames on his way. He was discovered and brought back to London by a group of fishermen. He was allowed to leave for France in a second escape attempt on 23 December. William permitted James to leave the country, not wanting to make him a martyr for the Roman Catholic cause; it was in his interests for James to be perceived as having left the country of his own accord, rather than having been forced or frightened into fleeing. William is the last person to successfully invade England by force of arms.

===Proclaimed king===
William summoned a Convention Parliament in England, which met on 22 January 1689, to discuss the appropriate course of action following James&#x27;s flight. William felt insecure about his position; though his wife preceded him in the line of succession to the throne, he wished to reign as king in his own right, rather than as a mere consort. The only precedent for a joint monarchy in England dated from the 16th century, when Queen Mary I married Philip of Spain. Philip remained king only during his wife&#x27;s lifetime, and restrictions were placed on his power. William, on the other hand, demanded that he remain as king even after his wife&#x27;s death. When the majority of Tory Lords proposed to acclaim her as sole ruler, William threatened to leave the country immediately. Furthermore, she, remaining loyal to her husband, refused.

The House of Commons, with a Whig majority, quickly resolved that the throne was vacant, and that it was safer if the ruler were Protestant. There were more Tories in the House of Lords, which would not initially agree, but after William refused to be a regent or to agree to remain king only in his wife&#x27;s lifetime, there were negotiations between the two houses and the Lords agreed by a narrow majority that the throne was vacant. On 13 February 1689, Parliament passed the Bill of Rights 1689, in which it deemed that James, by attempting to flee, had abdicated the government of the realm, thereby leaving the throne vacant.

The Crown was not offered to James&#x27;s infant son, who would have been the heir apparent under normal circumstances, but to William and Mary as joint sovereigns. It was, however, provided that &quot;the sole and full exercise of the regal power be only in and executed by the said Prince of Orange in the names of the said Prince and Princess during their joint lives&quot;.

William and Mary were crowned together at Westminster Abbey on 11 April 1689 by the Bishop of London, Henry Compton. Normally, the coronation is performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, but the Archbishop at the time, William Sancroft, refused to recognise James&#x27;s removal.

William also summoned a Convention of the Estates of Scotland, which met on 14 March 1689. He sent it a conciliatory letter, while James sent haughty uncompromising orders, swaying a majority in favour of William. On 11 April, the day of the English coronation, the Convention finally declared that James was no longer King of Scotland. William and Mary were offered the Scottish Crown; they accepted on 11 May.

===Revolution settlement===

William encouraged the passage of the Toleration Act 1689, which guaranteed religious toleration to Protestant nonconformists. It did not, however, extend toleration as far as he wished, still restricting the religious liberty of Roman Catholics, non-trinitarians, and those of non-Christian faiths. In December 1689, one of the most important constitutional documents in English history, the Bill of Rights, was passed. The Act, which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier Declaration of Right, established restrictions on the royal prerogative. It provided, amongst other things, that the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament, levy taxes without parliamentary consent, infringe the right to petition, raise a standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent, deny the right to bear arms to Protestant subjects, unduly interfere with parliamentary elections, punish members of either House of Parliament for anything said during debates, require excessive bail or inflict cruel and unusual punishments. William was opposed to the imposition of such constraints, but he chose not to engage in a conflict with Parliament and agreed to abide by the statute.

The Bill of Rights also settled the question of succession to the Crown. After the death of either William or Mary, the other would continue to reign. Next in the line of succession was Mary II&#x27;s sister, Anne, and her issue, followed by any children William might have had by a subsequent marriage. Roman Catholics, as well as those who married Catholics, were excluded.

==Rule with Mary II==

===Jacobite resistance===
Although most in Britain accepted William and Mary as sovereigns, a significant minority refused to acknowledge their claim to the throne, instead believing in the divine right of kings, which held that the monarch&#x27;s authority derived directly from God rather than being delegated to the monarch by Parliament. Over the next 57 years Jacobites pressed for restoration of James and his heirs. Nonjurors in England and Scotland, including over 400 clergy and several bishops of the Church of England and Scottish Episcopal Church as well as numerous laymen, refused to take oaths of allegiance to William.

Ireland was controlled by Roman Catholics loyal to James, and Franco-Irish Jacobites arrived from France with French forces in March 1689 to join the war in Ireland and contest Protestant resistance at the Siege of Derry. William sent his navy to the city in July, and his army landed in August. After progress stalled, William personally intervened to lead his armies to victory over James at the Battle of the Boyne on 1 July 1690, after which James fled back to France.

Upon William&#x27;s return to England, his close friend Dutch General Godert de Ginkell, who had accompanied William to Ireland and had commanded a body of Dutch cavalry at the Battle of the Boyne, was named Commander in Chief of William&#x27;s forces in Ireland and entrusted with further conduct of the war there. Ginkell took command in Ireland in the spring of 1691, and following the Battle of Aughrim, succeeded in capturing both Galway and Limerick, thereby effectively suppressing the Jacobite forces in Ireland within a few more months. After difficult negotiations a capitulation was signed on 3 October 1691—the Treaty of Limerick. Thus concluded the Williamite pacification of Ireland, and for his services, the Dutch general received the formal thanks of the House of Commons and was awarded the title of Earl of Athlone by the king.

A series of Jacobite risings also took place in Scotland, where Viscount Dundee raised Highland forces and won a victory on 27 July 1689 at the Battle of Killiecrankie, but he died in the fight and a month later Scottish Cameronian forces subdued the rising at the Battle of Dunkeld. William offered Scottish clans that had taken part in the rising a pardon provided that they signed allegiance by a deadline, and his government in Scotland punished a delay with the 1692 Massacre of Glencoe, which became infamous in Jacobite propaganda as William had countersigned the orders. Bowing to public opinion, William dismissed those responsible for the massacre, though they still remained in his favour; in the words of the historian John Dalberg-Acton, &quot;one became a colonel, another a knight, a third a peer, and a fourth an earl.&quot;

William&#x27;s reputation in Scotland suffered further damage when he refused English assistance to the Darien scheme, a Scottish colony (1698–1700) that failed disastrously.

===Parliament and faction===
Although the Whigs were William&#x27;s strongest supporters, he initially favoured a policy of balance between the Whigs and Tories. The Marquess of Halifax, a man known for his ability to chart a moderate political course, gained William&#x27;s confidence early in his reign. The Whigs, a majority in Parliament, had expected to dominate the government, and were disappointed that William denied them this chance. This &quot;balanced&quot; approach to governance did not last beyond 1690, as the conflicting factions made it impossible for the government to pursue effective policy, and William called for new elections early that year.

After the Parliamentary elections of 1690, William began to favour the Tories, led by Danby and Nottingham. While the Tories favoured preserving the king&#x27;s prerogatives, William found them unaccommodating when he asked Parliament to support his continuing war with France. As a result, William began to prefer the Whig faction known as the Junto. The Whig government was responsible for the creation of the Bank of England following the example of the Bank of Amsterdam. William&#x27;s decision to grant the Royal Charter in 1694 to the Bank of England, a private institution owned by bankers, is his most relevant economic legacy. It laid the financial foundation of the English takeover of the central role of the Dutch Republic and Bank of Amsterdam in global commerce in the 18th century.

William dissolved Parliament in 1695, and the new Parliament that assembled that year was led by the Whigs. The following year Parliament passed a colonial trade bill.

===War in Europe===
William continued to absent himself from Britain for extended periods during his Nine Years&#x27; War (1688–1697) against France, leaving each spring and returning to England each autumn. England joined the League of Augsburg, which then became known as the Grand Alliance. Whilst William was away fighting, his wife, Mary II, governed the realm, but acted on his advice. Each time he returned to England, Mary gave up her power to him without reservation, an arrangement that lasted for the rest of Mary&#x27;s life.

After the Anglo-Dutch fleet defeated a French fleet at La Hogue in 1692, the allies controlled the seas for the rest of the conflict, and the Treaty of Limerick (1691) pacified Ireland. At the same time, the Grand Alliance fared poorly in Europe, as William lost Namur in the Spanish Netherlands in 1692. A surprise attack on the French under the command of the Duke of Luxembourg at Steenkerke was repulsed and the French defeated the allies at the Battle of Landen in 1693. However, William managed to inflict such damage on the French in these battles that further major French offensives were ruled out. The following year, the Allies possessed the numerical upper hand in the Low Countries. This enabled William to recapture Huy in 1694. A year later, the Allies achieved their grand success and recaptured Namur from the French. The fortress was considered one of the strongest fortresses in Europe and the conquest was a major blow to Louis XIV&#x27;s reputation.

=== Economic crisis ===
William&#x27;s rule led to rapid inflation in England, which caused widespread hunger from 1693 onwards. The Nine Years&#x27; War damaged English maritime trade and led to a doubling in taxation. These factors coupled with government mismanagement caused a currency crisis 1695–1697 and a run on the recently created Bank of England.

== Later years ==

Mary II died of smallpox on 28 December 1694, aged 32, leaving William III to rule alone. William deeply mourned his wife&#x27;s death. Despite his conversion to Anglicanism, William&#x27;s popularity in England plummeted during his reign as a sole monarch.

===Rumours of homosexuality===
During the 1690s, rumours grew of William&#x27;s alleged homosexual inclinations and led to the publication of many satirical pamphlets by his Jacobite detractors. He did have several close male associates, including two Dutch courtiers to whom he granted English titles: Hans Willem Bentinck became Earl of Portland, and Arnold Joost van Keppel was created Earl of Albemarle. These relationships with male friends, and his apparent lack of mistresses, led William&#x27;s enemies to suggest that he might prefer homosexual relationships. William&#x27;s modern biographers disagree on the veracity of these allegations. Some believe there may have been truth to the rumours, while others affirm that they were no more than figments of his enemies&#x27; imaginations, as it was common for someone childless like William to adopt, or evince paternal affections for, a younger man.

Whatever the case, Bentinck&#x27;s closeness to William did arouse jealousies at the royal court. William&#x27;s young protégé, Keppel, aroused more gossip and suspicion, being 20 years William&#x27;s junior, strikingly handsome, and having risen from the post of a royal page to an earldom with some ease. Portland wrote to William in 1697 that &quot;the kindness which your Majesty has for a young man, and the way in which you seem to authorise his liberties ... make the world say things I am ashamed to hear.&quot; This, he said, was &quot;tarnishing a reputation which has never before been subject to such accusations&quot;. William tersely dismissed these suggestions, however, saying, &quot;It seems to me very extraordinary that it should be impossible to have esteem and regard for a young man without it being criminal.&quot;

===Peace with France===

In 1696, the Dutch territory of Drenthe made William its Stadtholder. In the same year, Jacobites plotted to assassinate William in an attempt to restore James to the English throne. The plan failed and support for William surged. Parliament passed a bill of attainder against the ringleader, John Fenwick, and he was beheaded in 1697. In accordance with the Treaty of Rijswijk (20 September 1697), which ended the Nine Years&#x27; War, King Louis XIV recognised William III as King of England, and undertook to give no further assistance to James II. Thus deprived of French dynastic backing after 1697, Jacobites posed no further serious threats during William&#x27;s reign.

As his life drew towards its conclusion, William, like many other contemporary European rulers, felt concern over the question of succession to the throne of Spain, which brought with it vast territories in Italy, the Low Countries and the New World. Charles II of Spain was an invalid with no prospect of having children; some of his closest relatives included Louis XIV of France and Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor. William sought to prevent the Spanish inheritance from going to either monarch, for he feared that such a calamity would upset the balance of power. William and Louis agreed to the First Partition Treaty (1698), which provided for the division of the Spanish Empire: Joseph Ferdinand, Electoral Prince of Bavaria, would obtain Spain, while France and the Holy Roman Emperor would divide the remaining territories between them. Charles II accepted the nomination of Joseph Ferdinand as his heir, and war appeared to be averted.

When, however, Joseph Ferdinand died of smallpox in February 1699, the issue re-opened. In 1700, William and Louis agreed to the Second Partition Treaty (also called the Treaty of London), under which the territories in Italy would pass to a son of the King of France, and the other Spanish territories would be inherited by a son of the Holy Roman Emperor. This arrangement infuriated both the Spanish, who still sought to prevent the dissolution of their empire, and the Holy Roman Emperor, who regarded the Italian territories as much more useful than the other lands. Unexpectedly, Charles II of Spain interfered as he lay dying in late 1700. Unilaterally, he willed all Spanish territories to Philip, Duke of Anjou, a grandson of Louis XIV. The French conveniently ignored the Second Partition Treaty and claimed the entire Spanish inheritance. Furthermore, Louis alienated William III by recognising James Francis Edward Stuart, the son of the former King James II (who died in September 1701), as &quot;de jure&quot; King of England. The subsequent conflict, known as the War of the Spanish Succession, broke out in July 1701 and continued until 1713/1714.

===English royal succession===
Another royal inheritance, apart from that of Spain, also concerned William. His marriage with Mary had not produced any children, and he did not seem likely to remarry. Mary&#x27;s sister, Anne, had borne numerous children, all of whom died during childhood. The death of her last surviving child (Prince William, Duke of Gloucester) in 1700 left her as the only individual in the line of succession established by the Bill of Rights. As the complete exhaustion of the defined line of succession would have encouraged a restoration of James II&#x27;s line, the English Parliament passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which provided that if Anne died without surviving issue and William failed to have surviving issue by any subsequent marriage, the Crown would pass to a distant relative, Sophia, Electress of Hanover (a granddaughter of James I), and to her Protestant heirs. The Act debarred Roman Catholics from the throne, thereby excluding the candidacy of several dozen people more closely related to Mary and Anne than Sophia. The Act extended to England and Ireland, but not to Scotland, whose Estates had not been consulted before the selection of Sophia.

==Death==

In 1702, William died of pneumonia, a complication from a broken collarbone following a fall from his horse, Sorrel. It was rumoured that the horse had been confiscated from Sir John Fenwick, one of the Jacobites who had conspired against William. Because his horse had stumbled into a mole&#x27;s burrow, many Jacobites toasted &quot;the little gentleman in the black velvet waistcoat&quot;. Years later, Winston Churchill, in his &quot;A History of the English-Speaking Peoples&quot;, stated that the fall &quot;opened the door to a troop of lurking foes&quot;. William was buried in Westminster Abbey alongside his wife. His sister-in-law and cousin, Anne, became queen regnant of England, Scotland and Ireland.

William&#x27;s death meant that he would remain the only member of the Dutch House of Orange to reign over England. Members of this House had served as stadtholder of Holland and the majority of the other provinces of the Dutch Republic since the time of William the Silent (William I). The five provinces of which William III was stadtholder—Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Gelderland, and Overijssel—all suspended the office after his death. Thus, he was the last patrilineal descendant of William I to be named stadtholder for the majority of the provinces. Under William III&#x27;s will, John William Friso stood to inherit the Principality of Orange as well as several lordships in the Netherlands. He was William&#x27;s closest agnatic relative, as well as grandson of William&#x27;s aunt Henriette Catherine. However, Frederick I of Prussia also claimed the Principality as the senior cognatic heir, his mother Louise Henriette being Henriette Catherine&#x27;s older sister. Under the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), Frederick I&#x27;s successor, Frederick William I of Prussia, ceded his territorial claim to Louis XIV, keeping only a claim to the title. Friso&#x27;s posthumous son, William IV, succeeded to the title at his birth in 1711; in the Treaty of Partition (1732), William IV agreed to share the title &quot;Prince of Orange&quot; with Frederick William.

==Legacy==


William&#x27;s primary achievement was to contain France when it was in a position to impose its will across much of Europe. His life&#x27;s aim was largely to oppose Louis XIV of France. This effort continued after his death during the War of the Spanish Succession. Another important consequence of William&#x27;s reign in England involved the ending of a bitter conflict between Crown and Parliament that had lasted since the accession of the first English monarch of the House of Stuart, James I, in 1603. The conflict over royal and parliamentary power had led to the English Civil War during the 1640s and the Glorious Revolution of 1688. During William&#x27;s reign, however, the conflict was settled in Parliament&#x27;s favour by the Bill of Rights 1689, the Triennial Act 1694 and the Act of Settlement 1701.

The historical verdict on William&#x27;s qualities as an army commander is mixed. Many contemporaries agreed that he was a great field commander. Even his enemies spoke highly of him. The Marquis de Quincy, for example, wrote that it was due to William&#x27;s insight and personal courage that the Allies held out at the Battle of Seneffe, while he also praises how William led his troops to safety during the battles of Steenkerque and Landen. Still, William has been blamed by French and British historians for his impatience and recklessness, and for treating lightly his life and the lives of his soldiers. British historian John Childs acknowledges William&#x27;s great qualities, but feels that he fell short as a field commander because, by often throwing himself into the fray, he no longer had the complete oversight. William commanded several field battles; Battle of Seneffe (1674), Battle of Cassel (1677), Battle of Saint-Denis (1678), Battle of the Boyne (1690), Battle of Steenkerque (1692) and the Battle of Landen. While most of these were defeats, it would be wrong to place the responsibility solely on him. He was up against a strong uniformly organised army with a coalition army. Many of the coalition troops were not as practised and disciplined as the Dutch troops, and it took time to incorporate them into the Dutch system. William did not attach much value to traditional victory signs either. He considered himself a winner if he managed to inflate French losses to the point where French offensive plans had to be abandoned. The battles he fought were almost all ones of attrition. That the Allies also suffered many casualties he took for granted. The Dutch army organisation was prepared for that; and, from 1689, so was England&#x27;s.

William endowed the College of William and Mary (in present-day Williamsburg, Virginia) in 1693. Nassau County, New York, a county on Long Island, is a namesake. Long Island itself was also known as Nassau during early Dutch rule. Though many alumni of Princeton University think that the town of Princeton, New Jersey (and hence the university), were named in his honour, this is probably untrue, although Nassau Hall, the college&#x27;s first building, is named for him. New York City was briefly renamed New Orange for him in 1673 after the Dutch recaptured the city, which had been renamed New York by the British in 1665. His name was applied to the fort and administrative centre for the city on two separate occasions reflecting his different sovereign status—first as Fort Willem Hendrick in 1673, and then as Fort William in 1691 when the English evicted Colonists who had seized the fort and city. Nassau, the capital of The Bahamas, is named after Fort Nassau, which was renamed in 1695 in his honour. The Dutch East India Company built a military fort in Cape Town, South Africa, in the 17th century, naming it the Castle of Good Hope. The five bastions were named after William III&#x27;s titles: Orange, Nassau, Catzenellenbogen, Buuren and Leerdam.

<text>Year 309 ([[Roman numerals|CCCIX]]) was a common year starting on Saturday of the Julian calendar. In the Roman Empire, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Licinianus and Constantius (or, less frequently, year 1062 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 309 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

<text>Year 307 ([[Roman numerals|CCCVII]]) was a common year starting on Wednesday of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Severus and Maximinus (or, less frequently, year 1060 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 307 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Roman Empire ====
* Winter: Emperor Galerius wins his second victory over the Sarmatians.
* Galerius sends Valerius Severus with the army of northern Italy, to suppress the rebellion in Rome. However, faced with their former emperor Maximian, the soldiers desert him, and Severus flees to Ravenna. Maximian besieges Severus in Ravenna, who then surrenders. Maxentius makes Severus a hostage, in an attempt to keep Galerius at bay.
* Summer: Anticipating an offensive by Galerius, Maximian travels to Gaul to make an alliance with Constantine I. 
* Late summer or autumn: Galerius invades Italy but Maxentius remains behind the walls of Rome. Galerius finds he cannot besiege the city, and the image of an emperor making efforts against Rome hurts Galerius&#x27; image among the troops. The fact that Maxentius is his son-in-law does not help, and Maxentius makes an effort to bribe Galerius&#x27; troops. Galerius unsuccessfully attempts to negotiate, and recognizing Maxentius&#x27; attempts at bribery and the danger of being trapped in Italy by Maximian and Constantine, Galerius chooses to withdraw from Italy. To satiate his troops during the withdrawal, he pillages the Italian countryside. Meanwhile, Maxentius executes Severus.
* December: Constantine marries Maximian&#x27;s daughter Fausta, and is promoted to Augustus by Maximian.
* Near the end of the year, Galerius gives his wife (Diocletian&#x27;s daughter) Galeria Valeria the title of Augusta.

==== China ====
* January 8 – Emperor Hui of Jin dies after a 16-year reign, in which eight dukes of the imperial family have conducted a civil war (War of the Eight Princes) against each other in a struggle for power. Huai of Jin, age 23, succeeds his father and becomes the third ruler of the Jin Dynasty.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Zhang Jun, Chinese prince of the Jin Dynasty (d. 346)

== Deaths ==

* January 8 – Hui of Jin, Chinese emperor of the Jin Dynasty (b. 259)
* September 16 – Severus II, Roman emperor (murdered)
* Septimius of Iesi, German bishop, martyr and saint
* Tuoba Luguan, Chinese chieftain of the Tuoba clan

<text>Year 310 ([[Roman numerals|CCCX]]) was a common year starting on Sunday of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Andronicus and [[Pompeius Probus|Probus]] (or, less frequently, year 1063 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 310 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Roman Empire ====
* Maximian, retired emperor, rebels against Constantine I in Arles while the latter is campaigning against the Franks.
* Maximinus Daza, &quot;caesar&quot; under Emperor Galerius, is acclaimed &quot;augustus&quot; by his troops. Galerius is forced to recognize him as co-ruler of the East. The Roman Empire is thus divided between seven simultaneous emperors: Galerius (East), Maximinus II (East), Licinius (Middle), Constantine I (West), Maximian (West), Maxentius (Italy), and Domitius Alexander (Africa).
* July – Maximian flees to Marseille where he is besieged and surrenders. Constantine encourages his suicide and Maximian, age 60, hangs himself. Emperor Maxentius condemns the killing of his father.
* Licinius campaigns with success against the Carpi.

==== Asia ====
* Haelhae becomes the king of the Korean kingdom of Silla.

=== By topic ===

==== Commerce ====
* At Trier, Constantine orders the minting of a new coin, the &quot;solidus&quot;, in an effort to offset the declining value of the &quot;denarius&quot; and bring stability to the imperial currency by restoring a gold standard. The solidus (later known as the &quot;bezant&quot;) will be minted in the Byzantine Empire without change in weight or purity until the 10th century.

==== Religion ====
* April 18 – Pope Eusebius succeeds Pope Marcellus I as the 31st pope, but is banished on August 17 by the Emperor Maxentius to Sicily, where he dies, perhaps from a hunger strike. 
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Ausonius, Roman poet and rhetorician (d. 395)
* Epiphanius of Salamis, Church Father (d. 403)
* Wulfila, Gothic bishop and missionary (d. 383)

== Deaths ==
* August 17 – Eusebius, bishop of Rome
* July – Maximian, Roman emperor (b. c. 250)
* Dan, Chinese empress of Xiongnu (or Han-Zhao)
* Domnina, Berenice, and Prosdoce, Christian martyrs
* Liu He, Chinese emperor of Xiongnu (or Han-Zhao)
* Liu Yuan, Chinese emperor of Xiongnu (or Han-Zhao)
*Luo Shang, Chinese general of the Jin dynasty (266–420)
* Emperor Ōjin of Japan, according to legend.

<text>Year 328 ([[Roman numerals|CCCXXVIII]]) was a leap year starting on Monday of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Ianuarinus and Iustus (or, less frequently, year 1081 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 328 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

<text>Æthelflæd ( – 12 June 918) ruled as Lady of the Mercians in the English Midlands from 911 until her death in 918. She was the eldest child of Alfred the Great, king of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex, and his wife Ealhswith.

Æthelflæd was born around 870 at the height of the Viking invasions of England. By 878, most of England was under Danish Viking rule – East Anglia and Northumbria having been conquered, and Mercia partitioned between the English and the Vikings – but in that year Alfred won a crucial victory at the Battle of Edington. Soon afterwards the English-controlled western half of Mercia came under the rule of Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians, who accepted Alfred&#x27;s overlordship. Alfred adopted the title King of the Anglo-Saxons (previously he was titled King of the West Saxons like his predecessors) claiming to rule all Anglo-Saxon people not living in areas under Viking control. In the mid-880s, Alfred sealed the strategic alliance between the surviving English kingdoms by marrying Æthelflæd to Æthelred.

Æthelred played a major role in fighting off renewed Viking attacks in the 890s, together with Æthelflæd&#x27;s brother, the future King Edward the Elder. Æthelred and Æthelflæd fortified Worcester, gave generous donations to Mercian churches and built a new minster in Gloucester. Æthelred&#x27;s health probably declined early in the next decade, after which it is likely that Æthelflæd was mainly responsible for the government of Mercia. Edward had succeeded as King of the Anglo-Saxons in 899, and in 909 he sent a West Saxon and Mercian force to raid the northern Danelaw. They returned with the remains of the royal Northumbrian saint Oswald, which were translated to the new Gloucester minster. Æthelred died in 911 and Æthelflæd then ruled Mercia as Lady of the Mercians. The accession of a female ruler in Mercia is described by the historian Ian Walker as &quot;one of the most unique events in early medieval history&quot;.

Alfred had built a network of fortified burhs and in the 910s Edward and Æthelflæd embarked on a programme of extending them. Among the towns where she built defences were Wednesbury, Bridgnorth, Tamworth, Stafford, Warwick, Chirbury and Runcorn. In 917 she sent an army to capture Derby, the first of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw to fall to the English, a victory described by Tim Clarkson as &quot;her greatest triumph&quot;. In 918 Leicester surrendered without a fight. Shortly afterwards the Viking leaders of York offered her their loyalty, but she died on 12June 918 before she could take advantage of the offer, and a few months later Edward completed the conquest of Mercia. Æthelflæd was succeeded by her daughter Ælfwynn, but in December Edward took personal control of Mercia and carried Ælfwynn off to Wessex.

Historians disagree whether Mercia was an independent kingdom under Æthelred and Æthelflæd but they agree that Æthelflæd was a great ruler who played an important part in the conquest of the Danelaw. She was praised by Anglo-Norman chroniclers such as William of Malmesbury, who described her as &quot;a powerful accession to [Edward&#x27;s] party, the delight of his subjects, the dread of his enemies, a woman of enlarged soul&quot;. According to Pauline Stafford, &quot;like ... ElizabethI she became a wonder to later ages&quot;. In Nick Higham&#x27;s view, medieval and modern writers have been so captivated by her that Edward&#x27;s reputation has suffered unfairly in comparison.

==Background==
Mercia was the dominant kingdom in southern England in the eighth century and maintained its position until it suffered a decisive defeat by Wessex at the Battle of Ellendun in 825. Thereafter the two kingdoms became allies, which was to be an important factor in English resistance to the Vikings.

In 865 the Viking Great Heathen Army landed in East Anglia and used this as a starting point for an invasion. The East Anglians were forced to buy peace and the following year the Vikings invaded Northumbria, where they appointed a puppet king in 867. They then moved on Mercia, where they spent the winter of 867–868. King Burgred of Mercia was joined by King Æthelred of Wessex and his brother, the future King Alfred, for a combined attack on the Vikings, who refused an engagement; in the end the Mercians bought peace with them. The following year, the Vikings conquered East Anglia. In 874 the Vikings expelled King Burgred and Ceolwulf became the last King of Mercia with their support. In 877 the Vikings partitioned Mercia, taking the eastern regions for themselves and allowing Ceolwulf to keep the western ones. He was described by the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; as &quot;a foolish king&#x27;s thegn&quot; who was a puppet of the Vikings. The historian Ann Williams regards this view as partial and distorted, that he was accepted as a true king by the Mercians and by King Alfred. The situation was transformed the following year when Alfred won a decisive victory over the Danes at the Battle of Edington.

Ceolwulf is not recorded after 879. His successor as the ruler of the English western half of Mercia, Æthelflæd&#x27;s husband Æthelred, is first seen in 881 when, according to the historian of medieval Wales, Thomas Charles-Edwards, he led an unsuccessful Mercian invasion of the north Welsh Kingdom of Gwynedd. In 883, he made a grant with the consent of King Alfred, thus acknowledging Alfred&#x27;s lordship. In 886 Alfred occupied the Mercian town of London, which had been in Viking hands. He then received the submission of all English not under Viking control and handed control of London over to Æthelred. In the 890s, Æthelred and Edward, Alfred&#x27;s son and future successor, fought off more Viking attacks. Alfred died in 899 and Edward&#x27;s claim to the throne was disputed by Æthelwold, son of Alfred&#x27;s elder brother. Æthelwold joined forces with the Vikings when he was unable to get sufficient support in Wessex, and his rebellion only ended with his death in battle in December 902.

==Sources==
The most important source for history in this period is the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; but Æthelflæd is almost ignored in the standard West Saxon version, in what F. T. Wainwright calls &quot;a conspiracy of silence&quot;. He argues that King Edward was anxious not to encourage Mercian separatism and did not wish to publicise his sister&#x27;s accomplishments, in case she became a symbol of Mercian claims. Brief details of her actions were preserved in a pro-Mercian version of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; known as the &quot;Mercian Register&quot; or the &quot;Annals of Æthelflæd&quot;; although it is now lost, elements were incorporated into several surviving versions of the &quot;Chronicle&quot;. The &quot;Register&quot; covers the years 902 to 924, and focuses on Æthelflæd&#x27;s actions; Edward is hardly mentioned and her husband only twice, on his death and as father of their daughter. Information about Æthelflæd&#x27;s career is also preserved in the Irish chronicle known as the &quot;Three Fragments&quot;. According to Wainwright, it &quot;contains much that is legendary rather than historical. But it also contains, especially for our period, much genuine historical information which seems to have its roots in a contemporary narrative.&quot; She was praised by Anglo-Norman chroniclers such as William of Malmesbury and John of Worcester and she has received more attention from historians than any other secular woman in Anglo-Saxon England.

==Family==
Æthelflæd was born around 870, the oldest child of King Alfred the Great and his Mercian wife, Ealhswith, who was a daughter of Æthelred Mucel, ealdorman of the Gaini, one of the tribes of Mercia. Ealhswith&#x27;s mother, Eadburh, was a member of the Mercian royal house, probably a descendant of King Coenwulf (796–821). Æthelflæd was thus half-Mercian and the alliance between Wessex and Mercia was sealed by her marriage to Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians. They are mentioned in Alfred&#x27;s will, which probably dates to the 880s. Æthelflæd, described only as &quot;my eldest daughter&quot;, received an estate and 100 mancuses, while Æthelred, the only ealdorman to be mentioned by name, received a sword worth 100 mancuses. Æthelflæd was first recorded as Æthelred&#x27;s wife in a charter of 887, when he granted two estates to the see of Worcester &quot;with the permission and sign-manual of King Alfred&quot; and the attestors included &quot;Æthelflæd &quot;conjux&quot;&quot;. The marriage may have taken place earlier, perhaps when he submitted to Alfred following the recovery of London in 886. Æthelred was much older than Æthelflæd and they had one known child, a daughter called Ælfwynn. Æthelstan, the eldest son of Edward the Elder and future king of England, was brought up in their court and, in the view of Martin Ryan, certainly joined their campaigns against the Vikings.

Æthelred&#x27;s descent is unknown. Richard Abels describes him as &quot;somewhat of a mysterious character&quot;, who may have claimed royal blood and been related to Æthelred Mucel. In the view of Ian Walker: &quot;He was a royal ealdorman whose power base lay in the south-west of Mercia in the former kingdom of the Hwicce around Gloucester&quot;. Alex Woolf suggests that he was probably the son of King Burgred of Mercia and King Alfred&#x27;s sister Æthelswith, although that would mean that the marriage between Æthelflæd and Æthelred was uncanonical, because Rome then forbade marriage between first cousins.

==Æthelflæd and Æthelred==
Compared to the rest of England, much of English Mercia —Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, Herefordshire and Shropshire —was unusually stable in the Viking age. It did not suffer major attacks and it did not come under great pressure from Wessex. Mercian scholarship had high prestige at the courts of Alfred and Edward. Worcester was able to preserve considerable intellectual and liturgical continuity and, with Gloucester, became the centre of a Mercian revival under Æthelred and Æthelflæd that extended into the more unstable areas of Staffordshire and Cheshire. Charters show the Mercian leaders supporting the revival by their generosity to monastic communities. In 883 Æthelred granted privileges to Berkeley Abbey and in the 890s he and Æthelflæd issued a charter in favour of the church of Worcester. This was the only occasion in Alfred&#x27;s lifetime when they are known to have acted jointly; generally Æthelred acted on his own, usually acknowledging the permission of King Alfred. Æthelflæd witnessed charters of Æthelred in 888, 889 and 896. In 901 Æthelflæd and Æthelred gave land and a golden chalice weighing thirty mancuses to the shrine of Saint Mildburg at Much Wenlock church.

At the end of the ninth century, Æthelred and Æthelflæd fortified Worcester, with the permission of King Alfred and at the request of Bishop Werferth, described in the charter as &quot;their friend&quot;. They granted the church of Worcester a half share of the rights of lordship over the city, covering land rents and the proceeds of justice, and in return the cathedral community agreed in perpetuity to dedicate a psalm to them three times a day and a mass and thirty psalms every Saturday. As the rights of lordship had previously belonged fully to the church, this represented the beginning of transfer from episcopal to secular control of the city. In 904 Bishop Werferth granted a lease of land in the city to Æthelred and Æthelflæd, to be held for the duration of their lives and that of their daughter Ælfwynn. The land was valuable, including most of the city&#x27;s usable river frontage, and control of it enabled the Mercian rulers to dominate over and profit from the city.

Æthelred&#x27;s health probably declined several years before his death in 911, with the result that Æthelflæd became the de facto ruler of Mercia, perhaps as early as 902, although he witnessed charters at a meeting attended by the king in 903. According to the &quot;Three Fragments&quot;, the Norse (Norwegian) Vikings were expelled from Dublin and then made an abortive attack on Wales. When this failed they applied to Æthelflæd for permission to settle near Chester. Æthelflæd agreed, perhaps in the hope that they would provide protection against attack by other Vikings. These events probably date to 902-903. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; states that in 907 Chester was &quot;restored&quot;. Æthelflæd was probably responsible for restoriation of the town&#x27;s Roman defences by running walls from the north-west and south-east corners of the fort to the River Dee. The Norse Vikings later joined with the Danes in an attack on Chester, but this failed because Æthelflæd had fortified the town, and she persuaded the Irish among the attackers to change sides. Most historians date the attack on Chester to 907, but Matthew Firth argues that 910 is more likely and that it may have been part of the invasion which ended in Viking defeat at the Battle of Tettenhall. Simon Ward, who excavated an Anglo-Saxon site in Chester, sees the later prosperity of the town as owing much to the planning of Æthelflæd and Edward. After Æthelflæd&#x27;s death, Edward encountered fierce resistance to his efforts to consolidate his control of the north-west and he died there in 924, shortly after suppressing a local rebellion.

In 909 Edward sent a West Saxon and Mercian force to the northern Danelaw, where it raided for five weeks. The remains of the royal Northumbrian saint Oswald were seized and taken from his resting place in Bardney Abbey in Lincolnshire to Gloucester. In the late ninth century Gloucester had become a burh with a street plan similar to Winchester, and Æthelred and Æthelflæd had repaired its ancient Roman defences. In 896 a meeting of the Mercian witan was held in the royal hall at Kingsholm, just outside the town. The Mercian rulers built a new minster in Gloucester and, although the building was small, it was embellished on a grand scale, with rich sculpture. The church appears to have been an exact copy of the Old Minster, Winchester. It was initially dedicated to St Peter but when Oswald&#x27;s remains were brought to Gloucester in 909, Æthelflæd had them translated from Bardney to the new minster, which was renamed St Oswald&#x27;s in his honour. The relics gave the church great prestige as Oswald had been one of the most important founding saints of Anglo-Saxon Christianity as well as a ruling monarch, and the decision to translate his relics to Gloucester shows the importance of the town to Æthelred and Æthelflæd, who were buried in St Oswald&#x27;s Minster. Simon Keynes describes the town as &quot;the main seat of their power&quot; and Carolyn Heighway believes that the foundation of the church was probably a family and dynastic enterprise, encouraged by Alfred and supported by Edward and Bishop Werferth. Heighway and Michael Hare wrote:

Mercia had a long tradition of venerating royal saints and this was enthusiastically supported by Æthelred and Æthelflæd. Saintly relics were believed to give supernatural legitimacy to rulers&#x27; authority, and Æthelflæd was probably responsible for the foundation or re-foundation of Chester Minster and the transfer to it of the remains of the seventh-century Mercian princess Saint Werburgh from Hanbury in Staffordshire. She may also have translated the relics of the martyred Northumbrian prince Ealhmund from Derby to Shrewsbury. In 910 the Danes retaliated against the English attack of the previous year by invading Mercia, raiding as far as Bridgnorth in Shropshire. On their way back they were caught by an English army in Staffordshire and their army was destroyed at the Battle of Tettenhall, opening the way for the recovery of the Danish Midlands and East Anglia over the next decade.

==Lady of the Mercians==
On her husband&#x27;s death in 911, Æthelflæd became &quot;Myrcna hlædige&quot;, &quot;Lady of the Mercians&quot;. Ian Walker describes her succession as the only case of a female ruler of a kingdom in Anglo-Saxon history and &quot;one of the most unique events in early medieval history&quot;. In Wessex, royal women were not allowed to play any political role; Alfred&#x27;s wife was not granted the title of queen and was never a witness to charters. In Mercia, Alfred&#x27;s sister Æthelswith had been the wife of King Burgred of Mercia; she had witnessed charters as queen and had made grants jointly with her husband and in her own name. Æthelflæd benefited from a Mercian tradition of queenly importance, and was able to play a key role in the history of the early tenth century as Lady of the Mercians, which would not have been possible in Wessex.

When Æthelred died, Edward took control of the Mercian towns of London and Oxford and their hinterlands, which Alfred had put under Mercian control. Ian Walker suggests that Æthelflæd accepted this loss of territory in return for recognition by her brother of her position in Mercia. Alfred had constructed a network of fortified burhs in Wessex, and Edward and Æthelflæd now embarked on a programme of extending them to consolidate their defences and provide bases for attacks on the Vikings. According to Frank Stenton, Æthelflæd led Mercian armies on expeditions, which she planned. He commented: &quot;It was through reliance on her guardianship of Mercia that her brother was enabled to begin the forward movement against the southern Danes which is the outstanding feature of his reign&quot;.

Æthelflæd had already fortified an unknown location called &quot;Bremesburh&quot; in 910 and in 912 she built defences at Bridgnorth to cover a crossing of the River Severn. In 913 she built forts at Tamworth to guard against the Danes in Leicester, and in Stafford to cover access from the Trent Valley. In 914 a Mercian army drawn from Gloucester and Hereford repelled a Viking invasion from Brittany, and the Iron Age Eddisbury hill fort was repaired to protect against invasion from Northumbria or Cheshire, while Warwick was fortified as further protection against the Leicester Danes. In 915 Chirbury was fortified to guard a route from Wales and Runcorn on the River Mersey. Defences were built before 914 at Hereford, and probably Shrewsbury and two other fortresses, at &quot;Scergeat&quot; and &quot;Weardbyrig&quot;, which have not been located.

In 917 invasions by three Viking armies failed as Æthelflæd sent an army which captured Derby and the territory around it. The town was one of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw, together with Leicester, Lincoln, Nottingham and Stamford. Derby was the first to fall to the English; she lost &quot;four of her thegns who were dear to her&quot; in the battle. Tim Clarkson, who describes Æthelflæd as &quot;renowned as a competent war-leader&quot;, regards the victory at Derby as &quot;her greatest triumph&quot;. At the end of the year, the East Anglian Danes submitted to Edward. In early 918, Æthelflæd gained possession of Leicester without opposition and most of the local Danish army submitted to her. A few months later, the leading men of Danish-ruled York offered to pledge their loyalty to Æthelflæd, probably to secure her support against Norse raiders from Ireland, but she died on 12 June 918, before she could take advantage of the offer. No similar offer is known to have been made to Edward. According to the &quot;Three Fragments&quot;, in 918 Æthelflæd led an army of Scots and Northumbrian English against forces led by the Norse Viking leader Ragnall at the Battle of Corbridge in Northumbria. Historians consider this unlikely, but she may have sent a contingent to the battle. Both sides claimed victory but Ragnall was able to establish himself as ruler of Northumbria. In the &quot;Three Fragments&quot;, Æthelflæd also formed a defensive alliance with the Scots and the Strathclyde British, a claim accepted by Clarkson.

Little is known of Æthelflæd&#x27;s relations with the Welsh. The only recorded event took place in 916, when she sent an expedition to avenge the murder of a Mercian abbot and his companions; her men destroyed the royal crannog of Brycheiniog on Llangorse Lake and captured the queen and thirty-three of her companions. According to a version of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; strongly sympathetic to Edward the Elder, after Æthelflæd&#x27;s death &quot;the kings among the Welsh, Hywel and Clydog and Idwal, and all the Welsh people sought to have [Edward] as their lord&quot;. Hywel Dda was king of Dyfed in south-west Wales, Clydog ap Cadell probably king of Powys in the north-east, and Idwal ab Anarawd king of Gwynedd in the north-west. Gwent in south-east Wales was already under West Saxon lordship but, in the view of Charles-Edwards, this passage shows that the other Welsh kingdoms were under Mercian lordship until Edward took direct power over Mercia.

No coins were issued with the name of Æthelred or Æthelflæd on them, but in the 910s silver pennies were minted in west Mercian towns with unusual ornamental designs on the reverse and this may have reflected Æthelflæd&#x27;s desire to distinguish specie issued under her control from that of her brother. After her death, west Mercian coin reverses were again the same as those on coins produced in Wessex. No charters of Edward survive for the period between 910 and his death in 924. In contrast, two survive in Æthelflæd&#x27;s sole name, S 224, possibly dating to 914 and S 225, dated 9 September 915, issued at &quot;Weardbyrig&quot;, one of the burhs she built at an unidentified location.

==Death and aftermath==
Æthelflæd died at Tamworth on 12June 918 and her body was carried to Gloucester, where she was buried with her husband in their foundation, St Oswald&#x27;s Minster. According to the &quot;Mercian Register&quot;, Æthelflæd was buried in the east porticus. A building suitable for a royal mausoleum has been found by archaeological investigation at the east end of the church and this may have been St Oswald&#x27;s burial place. Placement next to the saint would have been a prestigious burial location for Æthelred and Æthelflæd. William of Malmesbury wrote that their burial places were found in the &quot;south&quot; porticus during building works in the early twelfth century. He may have been misinformed about the position but it is also possible that the tombs were moved from their prestigious position next to the saint, when the couple became less known over time or when tenth-century kings acted to minimise the honour paid to their Mercian predecessors.

The choice of burial place was symbolic. Victoria Thompson argues that if Æthelflæd had chosen Edward&#x27;s royal mausoleum in Winchester as the burial place for her husband and herself, that would have emphasised Mercia&#x27;s subordinate status, whereas a traditional Mercian royal burial place such as Repton would have been a provocative declaration of independence; Gloucester, near the border with Wessex, was a compromise between the two. Martin Ryan sees the foundation as &quot;something like a royal mausoleum, intended to replace the one at Repton (Derbyshire) that had been destroyed by the Vikings&quot;. Æthelflæd died a few months too early to see the final conquest of the southern Danelaw by Edward. She was succeeded as Lady of the Mercians by her daughter, Ælfwynn, but in early December 918 Edward deposed her and took Mercia under his control. Many Mercians disliked the subordination of their ancient kingdom to Wessex, and Wainwright describes the Mercian annalist&#x27;s description of the deposition of Ælfwynn as &quot;heavy with resentment&quot;. Edward died in 924 at Farndon in Cheshire a few days after putting down a rebellion by Mercians and Welshmen at Chester.

==Legacy==
To the West Saxon version of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, Æthelflæd was merely King Edward&#x27;s sister, whereas for the &quot;Mercian Register&quot; she was Lady of the Mercians. Irish and Welsh annals described her as a queen and the Annals of Ulster, which ignore the deaths of Alfred and Edward, described her as &quot;famosissima regina Saxonum&quot; (renowned Saxon queen). She was also praised by Anglo-Norman historians such as John of Worcester and William of Malmesbury, who described her as &quot;a powerful accession to [Edward&#x27;s] party, the delight of his subjects, the dread of his enemies, a woman of enlarged soul&quot;. He claimed that she declined to have sex after the birth of her only child because it was &quot;unbecoming of the daughter of a king to give way to a delight which, after a time, produced such painful consequences&quot;. According to Nick Higham, &quot;successive medieval and modern writers were quite captivated by her&quot; and her brother&#x27;s reputation has suffered unfairly in comparison. In the twelfth century, Henry of Huntingdon paid her his own tribute:
:Heroic Elflede! great in martial fame,
:A man in valour, woman though in name:
:Thee warlike hosts, thee, nature too obey&#x27;d,
:Conqu&#x27;ror o&#x27;er both, though born by sex a maid.
:Chang&#x27;d be thy name, such honour triumphs bring.
:A queen by title, but in deeds a king.
:Heroes before the Mercian heroine quail&#x27;d:
:Caesar himself to win such glory fail&#x27;d.
Some historians believe that Æthelred and Æthelflæd were independent rulers. In the &quot;Handbook of British Chronology&quot;, David Dumville refers to &quot;Q. Æthelflæd&quot; and comments, &quot;The titles given her by all sources (&quot;hlæfdige, regina&quot;) imply that she wielded royal power and authority&quot;. Alex Woolf concurs and Pauline Stafford describes Æthelflæd as &quot;the last Mercian queen&quot;, referred to in charters in such terms as &quot;by the gift of Christ&#x27;s mercy ruling the government of the Mercians&quot;. Stafford argues that Æthelred and Æthelflæd exercised most or all of the powers of a monarch after Alfred&#x27;s death but it would have been a provocative act formally to claim regality, especially after Æthelwold&#x27;s rebellion. Stafford sees her as a &quot;warrior queen&quot;, &quot;Like ... ElizabethI she became a wonder to later ages.&quot; According to Charles Insley,

Wainwright sees Æthelflæd as willingly accepting a subordinate role in a partnership with her brother and agreeing to his plan of unification of Wessex and Mercia under his rule. Wainwright argues that he probably sent his oldest son Æthelstan to be brought up in Mercia, to make him more acceptable to the Mercians as king; Æthelflæd does not appear to have tried to find a husband for her daughter, who must have been nearly thirty by 918. In Wainwright&#x27;s view, she was ignored in West Saxon sources for fear that recognition of her achievements would encourage Mercian separatism:

Simon Keynes points out that all coins were issued in Edward&#x27;s name, and while the Mercian rulers were able to issue some charters on their own authority, others acknowledged Edward&#x27;s lordship. In 903 a Mercian ealdorman &quot;petitioned King Edward, and also Æthelred and Æthelflæd, who then held rulership and power over the race of the Mercians under the aforesaid king&quot;. Keynes argues that a new polity was created when Æthelred submitted to Alfred in the 880s, covering Wessex and English (western) Mercia. In Keynes&#x27;s view, &quot;the conclusion seems inescapable that the Alfredian polity of the kingship &#x27;of the Anglo-Saxons&#x27; persisted in the first quarter of the tenth century, and that the Mercians were thus under Edward&#x27;s rule from the beginning of his reign&quot;. Ryan believes that the Mercian rulers &quot;had a considerable but ultimately subordinate share of royal authority&quot;.

In Higham&#x27;s view, Keynes makes a strong case that Edward ruled over an Anglo-Saxon state with a developing administrative and ideological unity but that Æthelflæd and Æthelred did much to encourage a separate Mercian identity, such as establishing cults of Mercian saints at their new burhs, as well as reverence for their great Northumbrian royal saint at Gloucester:

==Commemoration==
In June 2018, Æthelflæd&#x27;s funeral was re-enacted in front of a crowd of 10,000 people in Gloucester, as part of a series of living history events marking the 1,100th anniversary of her death.
The 1,100th anniversary of the death of Æthelflaed was marked throughout 2018 in Tamworth with a number of major events, including the unveiling of a new six-metre statue, the creation of the town&#x27;s biggest ever piece of community art, a major commemorative church service, talks, a special guided walk, commemorative ale and an academic conference weekend drawing academics and delegates from all over the world.

<doc id="47398" wikidata="Q3367000" url="?curid=47398" title="Orchestration">
<text>Orchestration is the study or practice of writing music for an orchestra (or, more loosely, for any musical ensemble, such as a concert band) or of adapting music composed for another medium for an orchestra. Also called &quot;instrumentation&quot;, orchestration is the assignment of different instruments to play the different parts (e.g., melody, bassline, etc.) of a musical work. For example, a work for solo piano could be adapted and orchestrated so that an orchestra could perform the piece, or a concert band piece could be orchestrated for a symphony orchestra.

In classical music, composers have historically orchestrated their own music. Only gradually over the course of music history did orchestration come to be regarded as a separate compositional art and profession in itself. In modern classical music, composers almost invariably orchestrate their own work. Two notable exceptions to this are Ravel&#x27;s orchestration of Mussorgsky&#x27;s solo piano work Pictures at an Exhibition and Malcolm Arnold&#x27;s orchestration of William Walton&#x27;s String Quartet in A minor, producing the latter&#x27;s Sonata for Strings.

However, in musical theatre, film music and other commercial media, it is customary to use orchestrators and arrangers to one degree or another, since time constraints and/or the level of training of composers may preclude them orchestrating the music themselves.

The precise role of the orchestrator in film music is highly variable, and depends greatly on the needs and skill set of the particular composer.

In musical theatre, the composer typically writes a piano/vocal score and then hires an arranger or orchestrator to create the instrumental score for the pit orchestra to play.

In jazz big bands, the composer or songwriter may write a lead sheet, which contains the melody and the chords, and then one or more orchestrators or arrangers may &quot;flesh out&quot; these basic musical ideas by creating parts for the saxophones, trumpets, trombones, and the rhythm section (bass, piano/jazz guitar/Hammond organ, drums). But, commonly enough, big band composers have done their own arranging, just like their classical counterparts.

==As profession==
An orchestrator is a trained musical professional who assigns instruments to an orchestra or other musical ensemble from a piece of music written by a composer, or who adapts music composed for another medium for an orchestra. Orchestrators may work for musical theatre productions, film production companies or recording studios. Some orchestrators teach at colleges, conservatories or universities. The training done by orchestrators varies. Most have completed formal postsecondary education in music, such as a Bachelor of Music (B.Mus.), Master of Music (M.Mus.) or an artist&#x27;s diploma. Orchestrators who teach at universities, colleges and conservatories may be required to hold a master&#x27;s degree or a Doctorate (the latter may be a Ph.D. or a D.M.A). Orchestrators who work for film companies, musical theatre companies and other organizations may be hired solely based on their orchestration experience, even if they do not hold academic credentials. In the 2010s, as the percentage of faculty holding terminal degrees and/or Doctoral degrees is part of how an institution is rated, this is causing an increasing number of postsecondary institutions to require terminal and/or Doctoral degrees.

==In practice==
The term &quot;orchestration&quot; in its specific sense refers to the way instruments are used to portray any musical aspect such as melody, harmony or rhythm. For example, a C major chord is made up of the notes C, E, and G. If the notes are held out the entire duration of a measure, the composer or orchestrator will have to decide what instrument(s) play this chord and in what register. Some instruments, including woodwinds and brass are monophonic and can only play one note of the chord at a time. However, in a full orchestra there are more than one of these instruments, so the composer may choose to outline the chord in its basic form with a group of clarinets or trumpets (with separate instruments each being given one of the three notes of the chord). Other instruments, including the strings, piano, harp, and pitched percussion are polyphonic and may play more than one note at a time. As such, if the orchestrator wishes to have the strings play the C major chord, they could assign the low C to the cellos and basses, the G to the violas, and then a high E to the second violins and an E an octave higher to the first violins. If the orchestrator wishes the chord to be played only by the first and second violins, they could give the second violins a low C and give the first violins a double stop of the notes G (an open string) and E.

Additionally in orchestration, notes may be placed into another register (such as transposed down for the basses), doubled (both in the same and different octaves), and altered with various levels of dynamics. The choice of instruments, registers, and dynamics affect the overall tone color. If the C major chord was orchestrated for the trumpets and trombones playing fortissimo in their upper registers, it would sound very bright; but if the same chord was orchestrated for the cellos and double basses playing sul tasto, doubled by the bassoons and bass clarinet, it might sound heavy and dark.

Note that although the above example discussed orchestrating a chord, a melody or even a single note may be orchestrated in this fashion. Also note that in this specific sense of the word, &quot;orchestration&quot; is not necessarily limited to an orchestra, as a composer may &quot;orchestrate&quot; this same C major chord for, say, a woodwind quintet, a string quartet or a concert band. Each different ensemble would enable the orchestrator/composer to create different tone &quot;colours&quot; and timbres.

A melody is also orchestrated. The composer or orchestrator may think of a melody in their head, or while playing the piano or organ. Once they have thought of a melody, they have to decide which instrument (or instruments) will play the melody. One widely used approach for a melody is to assign it to the first violins. When the first violins play a melody, the composer can have the second violins double the melody an octave below, or have the second violins play a harmony part (often in thirds and sixths). Sometimes, for a forceful effect, a composer will indicate in the score that all of the strings (violins, violas, cellos, and double basses) will play the melody in unison, at the same time. Typically, even though the instruments are playing the same note names, the violins will play very high-register notes, the violas and cellos will play lower-register notes, and the double basses will play the deepest, lowest pitches.

As well, the woodwinds and brass instruments can effectively carry a melody, depending on the effect the orchestrator desires. The trumpets can perform a melody in a powerful, high register. Alternatively, if the trombones play a melody, the pitch will likely be lower than the trumpet, and the tone will be heavier, which may change the musical effect that is created. While the cellos are often given an accompaniment role in orchestration, there are notable cases where the cellos have been assigned the melody. In even more rare cases, the double bass section (or principal bass) may be given a melody, like, the high-register double bass solo in Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Lieutenant Kije Suite.&quot;

While assigning a melody to a particular section, such as the string section or the woodwinds will work well, as the stringed instruments and all the woodwinds blend together well, some orchestrators give the melody to one section and then have the melody doubled by a different section or an instrument from a different section. For example, a melody played by the first violins could be doubled by the glockenspiel, which would add a sparkling, chime-like colour to the melody. Alternatively, a melody played by the piccolos could be doubled by the celesta, which would add a bright tone to the sound.

In the 20th and 21st century, contemporary composers began to incorporate electric and electronic instruments into the orchestra, such as the electric guitar played through a guitar amplifier, the electric bass played through a bass amplifier, the Theremin and the synthesizer. The addition of these new instruments gave orchestrators new options for creating tonal colours in their orchestration. For example, in the late 20th century and onwards, an orchestrator could have a melody played by the first violins doubled by a futuristic-sounding synthesizer or a theremin to create an unusual effect.

Orchestral instrumentation is denoted by an abbreviated formulaic convention, as follows: flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, horn, trumpet, trombone, tuba. More details can be contained in brackets. A dot separates one player from another, a slash indicates doubling. Timpani and percussion are denoted 2Tmp+ number of percussion.

For example, 3[1.2.3/pic] 2[1.Eh] 3[1.2.3/Ebcl/bcl] 3[1.2/cbn.cbn] tmp+2 is interpreted as:

* 3 flautists, the 3rd doubling on piccolo (&quot;doubling&quot; means that the performer can play flute and piccolo)
* 2 oboists, the 2nd playing English horn throughout
* 3 clarinetists, the 3rd doubling also on E-flat clarinet and bass clarinet
* 3 bassoonists, the 2nd doubling on contrabassoon, the 3rd playing only contra
* Timpani+ 2 percussion.

As an example, Mahler Symphony 2 is scored: 4[1/pic.2/pic.3/pic.4/pic] 4[1.2.3/Eh.4/Eh] 5[1.2.3/bcl.4/Ebcl2.Ebcl] 4[1.2.3.4/cbn]- 10 8 4 1- 2tmp+4-2 hp- org- str.

==Examples from the repertoire==

===J.S Bach===
During the Baroque era, composers showed increasing awareness of the expressive potential of orchestration. While some early Baroque pieces have no indication of which instruments should play the piece, the choice of instruments being left to the musical group&#x27;s leader or concertmaster, there are Baroque works which specify certain instruments. The orchestral accompaniment to the aria &#x27;et misericordia&#x27; from J. S. Bach&#x27;s &quot;Magnificat&quot;, BWV 243 (1723) features muted strings doubled by flutes, a subtle combination of mellow instrumental timbres.

A particularly imaginative example of Bach&#x27;s use of changing instrumental colour between orchestral groups can be found in his Cantata BWV 67, &quot;Halt im Gedächtnis Jesum Christ&quot;. In the dramatic fourth movement, Jesus is depicted as quelling his disciples&#x27; anxiety (illustrated by agitated strings) by uttering &quot;Friede sei mit euch&quot; (&quot;Peace be unto you&quot;). The strings dovetail with sustained chords on woodwind to accompany the solo singer, an effect John Eliot Gardiner likens to &quot;a cinematic dissolve.&quot;

The orchestral introduction to the opening chorus of J. S. Bach&#x27;s epiphany Cantata &quot;Sie werden aus Saba alle kommen&quot; BWV 65, which John Eliot Gardiner (2013, p. 328) describes as &quot;one of the crowning glories of Bach&#x27;s first Christmas season&quot; further demonstrates the composer&#x27;s mastery of his craft. Within a space of eight bars, we hear recorders, oboes da caccia, horns and strings creating a &quot;glittery sheen&quot; of contrasted timbres, sonorities and textures ranging from just two horns against a string pedal point in the first bar to a &quot;restatement of the octave unison theme, this time by all the voices and instruments spread over five octaves&quot; in bars 7-8:

In contrast, Bach&#x27;s deployment of his instrumental forces in the opening movement of his &quot;St John Passion&quot; evokes a much darker drama: 

 “The relentless tremulant pulsation generated by the reiterated bass line, the persistent sighing figure in the violas and the violins the swirling motion in the violins so suggestive of turmoil… all contribute to its unique pathos. Over this ferment, pairs of oboes and flutes locked in lyrical dialogue but with anguished dissonances enact a very different kind of physicality, one that creates a harrowing portrayal of nails being driven into bare flesh.” 

Igor Stravinsky (1959, p45) marvelled at Bach&#x27;s skill as an orchestrator: &quot;What incomparable instrumental writing is Bach&#x27;s. You can smell the resin [(rosin)] in his violin parts, [and] taste the reeds in the oboes.&quot;

===Rameau===
Jean Philippe Rameau was famous for &quot;the eloquence of [his] orchestral writing which was something entirely new... - with a feeling for colour [(i.e., tone colour or timbre)] that is altogether &#x27;modern&#x27;.&quot; In &#x27;The Entrance of Polymnie&#x27; from his opera &quot;Les Boréades&quot; (1763), the predominant string texture is shot through with descending scale figures on the bassoon, creating an exquisite blend of timbres:In the aria &#x27;Rossignols amoureux&#x27; from his opera &quot;Hippolyte et Aricie&quot;, Rameau evokes the sound of lovelorn nightingales by means of two flutes blending with a solo violin, while the rest of the violins play sustained notes in the background.

===Haydn===
Joseph Haydn was a pioneer of symphonic form, but he was also a pioneer of orchestration. In the minuet of Symphony No. 97, &quot;we can see why Rimsky-Korsakov declared Haydn to be the greatest of all masters of orchestration. The oom-pah-pah of a German dance band is rendered with the utmost refinement, amazingly by kettledrums and trumpets pianissimo, and the rustic &quot;glissando&quot;… is given a finicky elegance by the grace notes in the horns as well as by the doubling of the melody an octave higher with the solo violin. These details are not intended to blend, but to be set in relief; they are individually exquisite.&quot; Another example of Haydn&#x27;s imagination and ingenuity that shows how well he understood how orchestration can support harmony may be found in the concluding bars of the second movement of his Symphony No. 94 (the &quot;Surprise Symphony.&quot;) Here, the oboes and bassoons take over the theme, while sustained chords in the strings accompany it with &quot;soft, but very dissonant harmony. &quot; Flute, Horns and timpani add to the mix, all contributing to the &quot;air of uncanny poignancy&quot; that characterises this atmospheric conclusion. 

===Mozart===
Mozart &quot;was acutely sensitive to matters of instrumentation and instrumental effect where orchestral writing was concerned&quot;, including a &quot;meticulous attitude towards the spacing of chords.&quot; H. C. Robbins Landon marvels at the &quot;gorgeous wash of colour displayed in Mozart&#x27;s scores.&quot; For example, the opening movement of the Symphony No. 39 (K543) contains &quot;a charming dialogue between strings and woodwind&quot; that demonstrates the composer&#x27;s exquisite aural imagination for the blending and contrast of timbres. Bars 102-3 feature a widely spaced voicing over a range of four octaves. The first and second violins weave curly parallel melodic lines, a tenth apart, underpinned by a pedal point in the double basses and a sustained octave in the horns. Wind instruments respond in bars 104–5, accompanied by a spidery ascending chromatic line in the cellos. A graceful continuation to this features clarinets and bassoons with the lower strings supplying the bass notes.Next, a phrase for strings alone blends pizzicato cellos and basses with bowed violins and violas, playing mostly in thirds:The woodwind repeat these four bars with the violins adding a counter-melody against the cellos and basses playing &quot;arco&quot;. The violas add crucial harmonic colouring here with their D flat in bar 115. In 1792, an early listener marvelled at the dazzling orchestration of this movement &quot;ineffably grand and rich in ideas, with striking variety in almost all obbligato parts.&quot;&quot;The main feature in [his] orchestration is Mozart&#x27;s density, which is of course part of his density of thought.&quot; Another important technique of Mozart&#x27;s orchestration was antiphony, the &quot;call and response&quot; exchange of musical motifs or &quot;ideas&quot; between different groups in the orchestra. In an antiphonal section, the composer may have one group of instruments introduce a melodic idea (e.g., the first violins), and then have the woodwinds &quot;answer&quot; by restating this melodic idea, often with some type of variation. In the trio section of the minuet from his Symphony No. 41 (1788), the flute, bassoons and horn exchange phrases with the strings, with the first violin line doubled at the octave by the first oboe: Charles Rosen (1971, p. 240) admires Mozart&#x27;s skill in orchestrating his piano concertos, particularly the Concerto in E flat major, K482, a work that introduced clarinets into the mix. &quot;This concerto places the greatest musical reliance on tone colour, which is, indeed, almost always ravishing. One lovely example of its sonorities comes near the beginning.&quot; 
The orchestral tutti in the first two bars is answered by just horns and bassoon in bars 2–6. This passage repeats with fresh orchestration: &quot;Here we have the unusual sound on the violins providing the bass for the solo clarinets. The simplicity of the sequence concentrates all our interest on tone-colour, and what follows – a series of woodwind solos – keeps it there. The orchestration throughout, in fact, has a greater variety than Mozart had wished or needed before, and fits the brilliance, charm, and grace of the first movement and the finale.&quot;

===Beethoven===
Beethoven&#x27;s innovative mastery of orchestration and his awareness of the effect of highlighting, contrasting and blending distinct instrumental colours are well exemplified in the Scherzo of his Symphony No. 2. George Grove asks us to note &quot;the sudden contrasts both in amount and quality of sound… we have first the full orchestra, then a single violin, then two horns, then two violins, then the full orchestra again, all within the space of half-a-dozen bars.&quot; &quot;The scoring, a bar of this followed by a bar of that, is virtually unique, and one can visualize chaos reigning at the first rehearsal when many a player must have been caught unprepared.&quot; 

Another demonstration of Beethoven&#x27;s consummate skill at obtaining the maximum variety out of seemingly unprepossessing and fairly simple material can be found in the first movement of the Piano Concerto No. 5 in E flat (&#x27;The Emperor&#x27;) Opus 73 (1810). The second subject of the sonata form is a deceptively simple tune that, according to Fiske (1970, p. 41) &quot;is limited to notes playable on the horns for which it must have been specially designed.&quot; This theme appears in five different orchestrations throughout the movement, with changes of mode (major to minor), dynamics (forte to pianissimo) and a blending of instrumental colour that ranges from boldly stated tutti passages to the most subtle and differentiated episodes, where instrumental sounds are combined often in quite unexpected ways:

The theme first appears in the minor mode during the orchestral introduction, performed using staccato articulation and orchestrated in the most delicate and enchanting colours: This is followed by a more straightforward version in the major key, with horns accompanied by strings. The theme is now played legato by the horns, accompanied by a sustained pedal point in the bassoons. The violins simultaneously play an elaborated version of the theme. (See also heterophony.) The timpani and pizzicato lower strings add further colour to this variegated palette of sounds. &quot;Considering that the notes are virtually the same the difference in effect is extraordinary&quot;: When the solo piano enters, its right hand plays a variant of the minor version of the theme in a triplet rhythm, with the backing of pizzicato (plucked) strings on the off-beats: This is followed by a bold &quot;tutti&quot; statement of the theme, &quot;with the whole orchestra thumping it out in aggressive semi-staccato. : The minor version of the theme also appears in the cadenza, played staccato by the solo piano: This is followed, finally, by a restatement of the major key version, featuring horns playing legato, accompanied by pizzicato strings and filigree arpeggio figuration in the solo piano: Fiske (1970) says that Beethoven shows &quot;a superb flood of invention&quot; through these varied treatments. &quot;The variety of moods this theme can convey is without limit.&quot;

===Berlioz===

The most significant orchestral innovator of the early 19th century was Hector Berlioz. (The composer was also the author of a &quot;Treatise on Instrumentation&quot;.) &quot;He was drawn to the orchestra as his chosen medium by instinct … and by finding out the exact capabilities and timbres of individual instruments, and it was on this raw material that his imagination worked to produce countless new sonorities, very striking when considered as a totality, crucially instructive for later composers, and nearly all exactly tailored to their dramatic or expressive purpose.&quot; Numerous examples of Berlioz&#x27;s orchestral wizardry and his penchant for conjuring extraordinary sonorities can be found in his &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot;. The opening of the fourth movement, entitled &quot;March to the Scaffold&quot; features what for the time (1830) must have seemed a bizarre mix of sounds. The timpani and the double basses play thick chords against the snarling muted brass: 

&quot;Although he derives from Beethoven, Berlioz uses features that run counter to the rules of composition in general, such as the chords in close position in the low register of the double basses.&quot;
Berlioz was also capable of conveying great delicacy in his instrumental writing. A particularly spectacular instance is the &quot;Queen Mab&quot; scherzo from the symphony, which Hugh Macdonald (1969, p51) describes as &quot;Berlioz&#x27;s supreme exercise in light orchestral texture, a brilliant, gossamer fabric, prestissimo and pianissimo almost without pause: 

Boulez points out that the very fast tempo must have made unprecedented demands on conductors and orchestras of the time (1830), &quot;Because of the rapid and precise rhythms, the staccatos which must be even and regular in all registers, because of the isolated notes that occur right at the end of the bar on the third quaver…all of which must fall into place with absolutely perfect precision.&quot;
Macdonald highlights the passage towards the end of the scherzo where &quot;The sounds become more ethereal and fairylike, low clarinet, high harps and the bell-like antique cymbals…The pace and fascination of the movement are irresistible; it is some of the most ethereally brilliant music ever penned.&quot; The New Grove Dictionary says that for Berlioz, orchestration &quot;was intrinsic to composition, not something applied to finished music...in his hands timbre became something that could be used in free combinations, as an artist might use his palette, without bowing to the demands of line, and this leads to the rich orchestral resource of Debussy and Ravel.&quot;

===Wagner===

After Berlioz, Richard Wagner was the major pioneer in the development of orchestration during the 19th century. Pierre Boulez speaks of the &quot;sheer richness of Wagner&#x27;s orchestration and his irrepressible instinct for innovation.&quot; Peter Latham says that Wagner had a &quot;unique appreciation of the possibilities for colour inherent in the instruments at his disposal, and it was this that guided him both in his selection of new recruits for the orchestral family and in his treatment of its established members. The well-known division of that family into strings, woodwind, and brass, with percussion as required, he inherited from the great classical symphonists such changes as he made were in the direction of splitting up these groups still further.&quot; Latham gives as an example, the sonority of the opening of the opera &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, where &quot;the ethereal quality of the music&quot; is due to the violins being &quot;divided up into four, five, or even eight parts instead of the customary two.&quot; &quot;The A major chord with which the &quot;Lohengrin&quot; Prelude begins, in the high register, using harmonics and held for a long time, lets us take in all its detail. It is undoubtedly an A major chord, but it is also high strings, harmonics, long notes – which gives it all its expressivity, but an expressivity in which the acoustic features play a central role, as we have still heard neither melody nor harmonic progression.&quot; As he matured as a composer, particularly through his experience of composing &quot;The Ring&quot; Wagner made &quot;increasing use of the contrast between pure and mixed colours, bringing to a fine point the art of transition from one field of sonority to another.&quot; For example, in the evocative &quot;Fire Music&quot; that concludes , &quot;the multiple arpeggiations of the wind chords and the contrary motion in the strings create an oscillation of tone-colours almost literally matching the visual flickering of the flames.&quot;Robert Craft found Wagner&#x27;s final opera &quot;Parsifal&quot; to be a work where &quot;Wagner&#x27;s powers are at their pinnacle… The orchestral blends and separations are without precedent.&quot; Craft cites the intricate orchestration of the single line of melody that opens the opera:

&quot;&quot;Parsifal&quot; makes entirely new uses of orchestral colour… Without the help of the score, even a very sensitive ear cannot distinguish the instruments playing the unison beginning of the Prelude. The violins are halved, then doubled by the cellos, a clarinet, and a bassoon, as well as, for the peak of the phrase, an alto oboe [cor anglais]. The full novelty of this colour change with the oboe, both as intensity and as timbre, can be appreciated only after the theme is repeated in harmony and in one of the most gorgeous orchestrations of even Wagner&#x27;s Technicolor imagination.&quot;
Later, during the opening scene of the first act of &quot;Parsifal&quot;, Wagner offsets the bold brass with gentler strings, showing that the same musical material feels very different when passed between contrasting families of instruments:

On the other hand, the prelude to the opera &quot;Tristan and Isolde&quot; exemplifies the variety that Wagner could extract through combining instruments from different orchestral families with his precise markings of dynamics and articulation. In the opening phrase, the cellos are supported by wind instruments: 

When this idea returns towards the end of the prelude, the instrumental colors are varied subtly, with sounds that were new to the 19th century orchestra, such as the cor anglais and the bass clarinet. These, together with the ominous rumbling of the timpani effectively convey the brooding atmosphere: 

&quot;It&#x27;s impressive to see how Wagner… produces balance in his works. He is true genius in this respect, undeniably so, even down to the working out of the exact number of instruments.&quot; Boulez is &quot;fascinated by the precision with which Wagner gauges orchestral balance, [which] … contains a multiplicity of details that he achieved with astonishing precision.&quot; According to Roger Scruton, &quot;Seldom since Bach&#x27;s inspired use of obbligato parts in his cantatas have the instruments of the orchestra been so meticulously and lovingly adapted to their expressive role by Wagner in his later operas.&quot;

===Mahler===
William Austin (1966) says &quot;Mahler expanded the orchestra, going ahead to a historic climax in the direction already marked by Beethoven, Berlioz and Wagner… The purpose of this famous expansion was not a sheer increase in volume, but a greater variety of sound with more nearly continuous gradations… Mahler only occasionally required all his vast orchestra to play together, and his music was as often soft as loud. Its colours were continually shifting, blending or contrasting with each other.&quot; Adorno (1971) similarly describes Mahler&#x27;s symphonic writing as characterised by &quot;massive tutti effects&quot; contrasted with &quot;chamber-music procedures&quot;. The following passage from the first movement of his Symphony No. 4 illustrates this: Only in the first bar of the above is there a full ensemble. The remaining bars feature highly differentiated small groups of instruments. Mahler&#x27;s experienced conductor&#x27;s ear led him to write detailed performance markings in his scores, including carefully calibrated dynamics. For example, in bar 2 above, the low harp note is marked &quot;forte&quot;, the clarinets, &quot;mezzo-forte&quot; and the horns &quot;piano&quot;. Austin (1966) says that &quot;Mahler cared about the finest nuances of loudness and tempo and worked tirelessly to fix these details in his scores.&quot;

Mahler&#x27;s imagination for sonority is exemplified in the closing bars of the slow movement of the Fourth Symphony, where there occurs what Walter Piston (1969, p. 140) describes as &quot;an instance of inspired orchestration… To be noted are the sudden change of mode in the harmonic progression, the unusual spacing of the chord in measure 5, and the placing of the perfect fourth in the two flutes. The effect is quite unexpected and magical.&quot; According to Donald Mitchell, the &quot;rational basis&quot; of Mahler&#x27;s orchestration was &quot;to enable us to comprehend his music by hearing precisely what was going on.&quot;

===Debussy===

Apart from Mahler and Richard Strauss, the major innovator in orchestration during the closing years of the nineteenth and the first decades of the twentieth century was Claude Debussy. According to Pierre Boulez (1975, p20) &quot;Debussy&#x27;s orchestration… when compared with even such brilliant contemporaries as Strauss and Mahler… shows an infinitely fresher imagination.&quot; Boulez said that Debussy&#x27;s orchestration was &quot;conceived from quite a different point of view; the number of instruments, their balance, the order in which they are used, their use itself, produces a different climate.&quot; Apart from the early impact of Wagner, Debussy was also fascinated by music from Asia that according to Austin &quot;he heard repeatedly and admired intensely at the Paris World exhibition of 1889&quot;.

Both influences inform Debussy&#x27;s first major orchestral work, &quot;Prélude à l&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot; (1894). Wagner&#x27;s influence can be heard in the strategic use of silence, the sensitively differentiated orchestration and, above all in the striking half-diminished seventh chord spread between oboes and clarinets, reinforced by a glissando on the harp. Austin (1966, p. 16) continues &quot;Only a composer thoroughly familiar with the Tristan chord could have conceived the beginning of the &quot;Faune&quot;.&quot;

Later in the &quot;Faune&quot;, Debussy builds a complex texture, where, as Austin says, &quot;Polyphony and orchestration overlap...He adds to all the devices of Mozart, Weber, Berlioz and Wagner the possibilities that he learned from the heterophonic music of the Far East... The first harp varies the flute parts in almost the same way that the smallest bells of a Javanese gamelan vary the slower basic melody.&quot;

Debussy&#x27;s final orchestral work, the enigmatic ballet &quot;Jeux&quot; (1913) was composed nearly 20 years after the &quot;Faune&quot;. The opening bars feature divided strings, spread over a wide range, a harp doubling horns with the addition of the bell-like celesta in the 5th bar and the sultry voicing of the whole tone chords in the woodwind:

Jensen (2014, p. 228) says &quot;Perhaps the greatest marvel of &quot;Jeux&quot; is its orchestration. While working on the piano score, Debussy wrote: &#x27;I am thinking of that orchestral colour which seems to be illuminated from behind, and for which there are such marvellous displays in &quot;Parsifal&quot;″ The idea, then, was to produce timbre without glare, subdued... but to do so with clarity and precision.&quot;

==As adaptation==
In a more general sense, &quot;orchestration&quot; also refers to the re-adaptation of existing music into another medium, particularly a full or reduced orchestra. There are two general kinds of adaptation: transcription, which closely follows the original piece, and arrangement, which tends to change significant aspects of the original piece. In terms of adaptation, &quot;orchestration&quot; applies, strictly speaking, only to writing for orchestra, whereas the term &quot;instrumentation&quot; applies to instruments used in the texture of the piece. In the study of orchestration – in contradistinction to the practice – the term &quot;instrumentation&quot; may also refer to consideration of the defining characteristics of individual instruments rather than to the art of combining instruments.

In commercial music, especially musical theatre and film music, independent orchestrators are often used because it is difficult to meet tight deadlines when the same person is required both to compose and to orchestrate. Frequently, when a stage musical is adapted to film, such as &quot;Camelot&quot; or &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, the orchestrations for the film version are notably different from the stage ones. In other cases, such as &quot;Evita&quot;, they are not, and are simply expanded versions from those used in the stage production.

Most orchestrators often work from a draft (sketch), or short score, that is, a score written on limited number of independent musical staves. Some orchestrators, particularly those writing for the opera or music theatres, prefer to work from a piano vocal score up, since the singers need to start rehearsing a piece long before the whole work is fully completed. That was, for instance, the method of composition of Jules Massenet. In other instances, simple cooperation between various creators is utilized, as when Jonathan Tunick orchestrates Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s songs, or when orchestration is done from a lead sheet (a simplified music notation for a song which includes just the melody and the chord progression). In the latter case, arranging as well as orchestration will be involved.

==Film orchestration==
Due to the enormous time constraints of film scoring schedules, most film composers employ orchestrators rather than doing the work themselves, although these orchestrators work under the close supervision of the composer. Some film composers have made the time to orchestrate their own music, including Bernard Herrmann (1911–1975), Georges Delerue (1925–1992), Ennio Morricone (1928–2020), John Williams (born 1932) (his very detailed sketches are 99% orchestrated), Howard Shore (born 1946), James Horner (1953–2015) (on Braveheart), Bruno Coulais (born 1954), Rachel Portman (born 1960), Philippe Rombi (born 1968) and Abel Korzeniowski (born 1972).

Some staff composers at the Walt Disney studios during the 1930s and 1940s (except for Frank Churchill) had orchestrated their own music, such as Paul J. Smith (on &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot;, and &quot;Fun and Fancy Free&quot;.
Leigh Harline (on &quot;Snow White&quot; and &quot;Pinocchio&quot;), Oliver Wallace (on &quot;Dumbo&quot;) and Edward H. Plumb (on &quot;Bambi&quot;). These composers also developed themes and songs that Churchill had written. Plumb continued to provide numerous film orchestrations at the Disney studios until his death in 1958.

Although there have been hundreds of orchestrators in film over the years, the most prominent film orchestrators for the latter half of the 20th century were Jack Hayes, Herbert W. Spencer, Edward Powell (who worked almost exclusively with Alfred Newman), Arthur Morton, Greig McRitchie, and Alexander Courage. Some of the most in-demand orchestrators today (and of the past 30 years) include Jeff Atmajian, Pete Anthony, Brad Dechter (James Newton Howard, Christopher Young, Theodore Shapiro, Teddy Castellucci, Danny Elfman, John Powell, Marco Beltrami, John Debney, Marc Shaiman, Michael Giacchino, Ludwig Göransson), Conrad Pope (John Williams, Alexandre Desplat, Jerry Goldsmith, James Newton Howard, Alan Silvestri, James Horner, Mark Isham, John Powell, Michael Convertino, Danny Elfman, Howard Shore), Eddie Karam (John Williams, James Horner), Bruce Fowler (Hans Zimmer, Klaus Badelt, Harry Gregson-Williams, Steve Jablonsky, Mark Mancina, John Powell), John Ashton Thomas (John Powell, John Debney, Alan Silvestri, James Newton Howard, Henry Jackman, Lyle Workman, Theodore Shapiro, John Ottman, John Paesano, Alex Heffes, Christophe Beck, Carter Burwell), Robert Elhai (Elliot Goldenthal, Michael Kamen, Ed Shearmur, Brian Tyler, Klaus Badelt, Ilan Eshkeri) and J.A.C. Redford (James Horner, Thomas Newman).

Conrad Salinger was the most prominent orchestrator of MGM musicals from the 1940s to 1962, orchestrating such famous films as &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, &quot;An American in Paris&quot;, and &quot;Gigi&quot;. In the 1950s, film composer John Williams frequently spent time with Salinger informally learning the craft of orchestration. Robert Russell Bennett (George Gershwin, Rodgers and Hammerstein) was one of America&#x27;s most prolific orchestrators (particularly of Broadway shows) of the 20th century, sometimes scoring over 80 pages a day.

===Process===
Most films require 30 to 120 minutes of musical score. Each individual piece of music in a film is called a &quot;cue&quot;. There are roughly 20-80 cues per film. A dramatic film may require slow and sparse music while an action film may require 80 cues of highly active music. Each cue can range in length from five seconds to more than ten minutes as needed per scene in the film. After the composer is finished composing the cue, this sketch score is delivered to the orchestrator either as hand written or computer generated. Most composers in Hollywood today compose their music using sequencing software (e.g. Digital Performer, Logic Pro, or Cubase). A sketch score can be generated through the use of a MIDI file which is then imported into a music notation program such as Finale or Sibelius. Thus begins the job of the orchestrator.

Every composer works differently and the orchestrator&#x27;s job is to understand what is required from one composer to the next. If the music is created with sequencing software then the orchestrator is given a MIDI sketch score and a synthesized recording of the cue. The sketch score only contains the musical notes (e.g. eighth notes, quarter notes, etc.) with no phrasing, articulations, or dynamics. The orchestrator studies this synthesized &quot;mockup&quot; recording listening to dynamics and phrasing (just as the composer has played them in). They then accurately try to represent these elements in the orchestra. However some voicings on a synthesizer (synthestration) will not work in the same way when orchestrated for the live orchestra.

The sound samples are often doubled up very prominently and thickly with other sounds in order to get the music to &quot;speak&quot; louder. The orchestrator sometimes changes these synth voicings to traditional orchestral voicings in order to make the music flow better. He may move intervals up or down the octave (or omit them entirely), double certain passages with other instruments in the orchestra, add percussion instruments to provide colour, and add Italian performance marks (e.g. Allegro con brio, Adagio, ritardando, dolce, staccato, etc.). If a composer writes a large action cue, and no woodwinds are used, the orchestrator will often add woodwinds by doubling the brass music up an octave. The orchestra size is determined from the music budget of the film.

The orchestrator is told in advance the number of instruments he has to work with and has to abide by what is available. A big-budget film may be able to afford a Romantic music era-orchestra with over 100 musicians. In contrast, a low-budget independent film may only be able to afford a 20 performer chamber orchestra or a jazz quartet. Sometimes a composer will write a three-part chord for three flutes, although only two flutes have been hired. The orchestrator decides where to put the third note. For example, the orchestrator could have the clarinet (a woodwind that blends well with flute) play the third note. After the orchestrated cue is complete it is delivered to the copying house (generally by placing it on a computer server) so that each instrument of the orchestra can be electronically extracted, printed, and delivered to the scoring stage.

The major film composers in Hollywood each have a lead orchestrator. Generally the lead orchestrator attempts to orchestrate as much of the music as possible if time allows. If the schedule is too demanding, a team of orchestrators (ranging from two to eight) will work on a film. The lead orchestrator decides on the assignment of cues to other orchestrators on the team. Most films can be orchestrated in one to two weeks with a team of five orchestrators. New orchestrators trying to obtain work will often approach a film composer asking to be hired. They are generally referred to the lead orchestrator for consideration. At the scoring stage the orchestrator will often assist the composer in the recording booth giving suggestions on how to improve the performance, the music, or the recording. If the composer is conducting, sometimes the orchestrator will remain in the recording booth to assist as a producer. Sometimes the roles are reversed with the orchestrator conducting and the composer producing from the booth.

<doc id="47399" wikidata="Q192925" url="?curid=47399" title="Edgar, King of England">
<text>Edgar (or Eadgar; 8 July 975) was King of the English from 959 until his death in 975, known sometimes as Edgar the Peacemaker or Edgar the Peaceable. He became king of all England on his brother&#x27;s death. He was the younger son of King Edmund I and his first wife Ælfgifu. A detailed account of Edgar&#x27;s reign is not possible, because only a few events were recorded by chroniclers and monastic writers were more interested in recording the activities of the leaders of the church.

Edgar mainly followed the political policies of his predecessors, but there were major changes in the religious sphere. The English Benedictine Reform, which he strongly supported, became a dominant religious and social force. It is seen by historians as a major achievement, and it was accompanied by a literary and artistic flowering, mainly associated with Æthelwold, Bishop of Winchester. Monasteries aggressively acquired estates from lay landowners with Edgar&#x27;s assistance, leading to disorder when he died and former owners sought to recover their lost property, sometimes by force. Edgar&#x27;s major administrative reform was the introduction of a standardised coinage in the early 970s to replace the previous decentralised system. He also issued legislative codes which mainly concentrated on improving procedures for enforcement of the law.

England had suffered from Viking invasions for over a century when Edgar came to power, but there were none during his reign, which fell in a lull in attacks between the mid-950s and the early 980s. After his death the throne was disputed between the supporters of his two surviving sons; the elder one, Edward the Martyr, was chosen with the support of Dunstan, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Three years later Edward was murdered and succeeded by his younger half-brother, Æthelred the Unready. Later chroniclers presented Edgar&#x27;s reign as a golden age when England was free from external attacks and internal disorder, especially compared with Æthelred&#x27;s disastrous rule. Modern historians see Edgar&#x27;s reign as the pinnacle of Anglo-Saxon culture, but they disagree about his political legacy, and some see the disorders following his death as a natural reaction to his overbearing control.

== Sources ==
Edgar is described by the historian Ann Williams as &quot;an enigmatic figure&quot; because of the very limited information available on him, and Barbara Yorke describes his personality as &quot;elusive&quot;. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; (&quot;ASC&quot;) has only ten entries on his reign, and other sources dating to the late tenth and early eleventh centuries are mainly interested in the episcopal leaders of the English Benedictine Reform movement. There are further details in the works of post-Conquest monastic chroniclers, but their material is often legendary and unreliable. A few events have been recorded in detail, but it is not possible to write a chronological account of Edgar&#x27;s reign.

In the ninth century, Anglo-Saxon England came under increasing attack from Viking raids, culminating in invasion by the Viking Great Heathen Army in 865. By 878, the Vikings had overrun the kingdoms of Northumbria, East Anglia, and Mercia, and nearly conquered Wessex, but in that year the West Saxons achieved a decisive victory at the Battle of Edington under King Alfred the Great. By 883, Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians, had accepted Alfred&#x27;s overlordship, and in the 880s and 890s the Anglo-Saxons ruled Wessex and western Mercia, but the rest of England remained under Viking rule. Alfred died in 899, and in the 910s his son King Edward the Elder and daughter Æthelflæd, Lady of the Mercians, who was Æthelred&#x27;s widow, conquered Viking-ruled eastern Mercia and East Anglia. Æthelflæd died in 918 and the Mercians installed her daughter Ælfwynn as the second Lady of the Mercians, but Edward seized her and established full control over Mercia.

Edward died in 924 and was succeeded by his eldest son Æthelstan, who may have been king only of Mercia at first, but ruled the whole of his father&#x27;s realm by the next year. In 927, he conquered Northumbria, and thus became the first king of all England. He died in October 939 and was succeeded by his half-brother and Edgar&#x27;s father, Edmund, who almost immediately lost control of the north to the Vikings, but recovered full control of England by 944. In May 946, he was stabbed to death trying to protect his seneschal from attack by a convicted outlaw, and as his sons Eadwig and Edgar were infants, their uncle Eadred became king. Like Edmund, Eadred inherited the kingship of the whole of England and soon lost it when York (southern Northumbria) accepted a Viking king, but he recovered it when the York magnates expelled Erik Bloodaxe in 954.

Eadred was very close to Edmund and inherited his leading counsellors, which resulted in a high degree of continuity of government when he became king. These counsellors included their mother, Eadgifu; Oda, Archbishop of Canterbury; Ælfsige, Bishop of Winchester; and Æthelstan, ealdorman of East Anglia, who was known as the Half-King because it was believed that kings depended on his advice. Another key adviser was Dunstan, Abbot of Glastonbury and future Archbishop of Canterbury. Eadred suffered from ill health, which became much worse towards the end of his reign. Most surviving charters of the last two years of his reign were produced by an agency associated with Glastonbury Abbey, and almost all of these were not attested by the king, suggesting that Dunstan was authorised to issue charters in Eadred&#x27;s name when he was too ill to carry out his duties. Eadred was in his early thirties when he died on 23 November 955, and Eadwig succeeded at the age of around fifteen. He was the first king since the early ninth century not to face the threat of imminent foreign invasion, and England remained free from Viking attacks until 980.

== Early life ==
Edgar was the younger son of Edmund and his first wife, Ælfgifu, and he was born in 943 or 944, the year his mother died. She was a benefactor of Shaftesbury Abbey, an establishment for nuns, and was buried and venerated as a saint there. Her mother Wynflæd, who died around 950, was a vowess (religious woman), who was also a benefactor of the nunnery. Edgar was brought up by Ælfwynn, the wife of Æthelstan Half-King, and in about 958 Edgar gave her a ten-hide () estate at Old Weston in Huntingdonshire in gratitude. Æthelstan was a strong supporter of the Benedictine reform movement, which became dominant during Edgar&#x27;s reign, and the historian Robin Fleming comments that Edgar (prince eligible for the throne) was profoundly influenced by his upbringing:
:Thus, the was reared in the household of one of his father&#x27;s closest allies and raised among Half-King&#x27;s own brothers and sons, five of whom at one time or another were ealdormen. Since Half-King was an intimate of the reform circle, and St Dunstan in particular, Edgar came of age in an atmosphere dominated by the ideals of monastic reform. Some of Edgar&#x27;s affection for monks and his determination to revive Benedictine monasticism must have been acquired in this household of his youth.

Eadwig and Edgar are not recorded in contemporary sources until 955, when they first attested charters, suggesting that they did not regularly attend court when they were young. Shortly before his death Eadred granted the secular (non-monastic) minster at Abingdon to Æthelwold, the future Bishop of Winchester, who converted it into a monastic establishment, Abingdon Abbey, with himself as its abbot. Edgar was educated there by Æthelwold, who was another leader of the monastic reform movement, and who was thus able to reinforce the young prince&#x27;s belief in its virtues. As Eadwig succeeded shortly after Æthelwold&#x27;s appointment, it is likely that Edgar&#x27;s education at Abingdon was approved by his elder brother as king, and that Æthelwold and Eadwig were on good terms.

== Edgar in Eadwig&#x27;s early reign, 955 to 957 ==
Eadwig became king on Eadred&#x27;s death on 23 November 955. Historians have often been critical of Eadwig, portraying him as irresponsible or incompetent, and one piece of evidence cited for this view is the exceptional number of charters he issued in 956. His sixty-odd gifts of land in that year make up around five per cent of all genuine Anglo-Saxon charters, and no other ruler in Europe is known to have matched that yearly total before the twelfth century. The historian Ann Williams observes that the many charters may indicate that Eadwig had to buy support, but too little is known about the background to be certain.

When Eadwig succeeded, the court was ruled by powerful factions, and he appears to have been determined to show his independence of action from the start. In the view of the historian Ben Snook, &quot;Eadwig, unlike his brother Edgar, was clearly his own man. Immediately on coming to power, he acted to put a stop to all this.&quot; Simon Keynes argues that &quot;whether Eadwig and Edgar were able to assert their own independence of action, or remained at the mercy of established interests at court, is unclear&quot;. Eadwig quarrelled with some of his uncle&#x27;s leading counsellors, especially Dunstan, who he exiled abroad. Eadgifu had frequently attested charters in the reigns of her sons Edmund and Eadred, but she only attested one of Eadwig&#x27;s, and she later alleged that she had been &quot;despoiled of all her property&quot; during his reign. On the other hand, Edgar was prominent at his brother&#x27;s court between 955 and 957, attesting many of his charters, in one of which he is shown as (underking).

Some of the hostility towards Eadwig was probably due to his promotion of his friends, especially Ælfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia, at the expense of the old guard, such as Dunstan. Ælfhere and his brothers were acknowledged by several kings as relatives, but the nature of the relationship is unknown. They were close to Eadwig and he made the eldest brother, Ælfheah, his (seneschal). Ælfheah and his wife Ælfswith, who was also acknowledged by Eadwig as a relative, benefited from his generosity. Ælfhere, who was to become the pre-eminent lay magnate until his death in 983, was appointed an ealdorman in Mercia in 956. Other ealdormen appointed were Æthelstan Rota in Mercia in late 955 and Byrhtnoth, the future hero of the Battle of Maldon, who became ealdorman of Essex in 956. Eadwig appointed Æthelwold, the eldest son of Æthelstan Half-King, as an ealdorman in East Anglia. These were sound appointments of men from established families and Edgar kept them when he came to power. Frank Stenton, in his volume in the Oxford History of England, &quot;Anglo-Saxon England&quot; (described by Keynes as &quot;magisterial and massively authoritative&quot;), comments that &quot;it can at least be said for King Eadwig that he agreed to the promotion of good servants&quot;.

== King of Mercia, 957 to 959 ==
In 957, the kingdom of England was divided between Eadwig, who kept Wessex, and Edgar who became king of Mercia, with the River Thames forming the boundary. It is uncertain whether this was the result of a coup against Eadwig or a decision to divide the kingdom between the brothers. Christopher Lewis (historian) sees the division as the solution to &quot;a dangerously unstable government and a court in deep crisis&quot;; Sean Miller and Rory Naismith attribute it to an unsuccessful attempt by Eadwig to promote a powerful new faction at the expense of the old guard. According to Dunstan&#x27;s first biographer, who only named himself as &quot;B&quot;: &quot;King Eadwig was totally abandoned by the people north [of the Thames]. They despised him for his imprudent discharge of the power entrusted to him. The wise and sensible he destroyed in a spirit of idle hatred, replacing them with ignoramuses like himself to whom he took a liking.&quot; This is the view of a partisan of Dunstan, who was Eadwig&#x27;s enemy. &quot;B&quot; was probably in exile with Dunstan when the division took place. Archbishop Oda forced Eadwig to divorce his wife Ælfgifu on the ground that they were too closely related, but Edgar was on good terms with her when he became king.

Four versions of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; mention the division of the kingdom, and they all state that Edgar &quot;succeeded&quot; to the kingship of the Mercians, as if it was a normal and expected event. Manuscripts D and F of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; (&quot;ASC D&quot; and &quot;ASC F&quot;), date the division to 955, whereas &quot;ASC B&quot; and &quot;ASC C&quot; correctly date it to 957. The difference in dates may be because it was agreed in Eadred&#x27;s reign that the kingdom would be divided between the brothers, but he died before Edgar was old enough to act in person and had to wait until he reached the age of majority of fourteen in 957. Charter attestations show that the magnates did not decide which court to attend on the basis of personal loyalty: ealdormen and bishops with jurisdictions south of the Thames stayed with Eadwig, and those north of it served Edgar. Keynes comments: &quot;One need not imagine that the unity of England would have been regarded in the 950s as something necessarily desirable for its own sake, not least because it was of such recent creation.&quot; Almost all thegns who had attested Eadwig&#x27;s charters before the division stayed with him. The historian Frederick Biggs argues that the division was a revival of the earlier Anglo-Saxon practice of joint kingship, against the opposition of the Church, and Bishop Æthelwold complained that Eadwig had &quot;through the ignorance of childhood dispersed his kingdom and divided its unity&quot;.

Eadwig retained some degree of seniority, as he attested charters as &quot;King of the English&quot;, whereas Edgar was usually &quot;King of the Mercians&quot;, and also occasionally of the Northumbrians and the British. All coins, including those issued in Mercia, were in Eadwig&#x27;s name until his death, The contemporary chronicler Æthelweard, who may have been Eadwig&#x27;s brother-in-law, wrote that he &quot;held the kingdom continuously for four years&quot;. There is no evidence of rivalry between the brothers, but they did disagree over Dunstan. Edgar recalled him from his exile, and soon afterwards appointed him to the Mercian bishoprics of London and Worcester. Æthelstan Half-King retired when the division took place, perhaps because Edgar had reached an age to take over. In 958, Edgar gave an estate at Sutton in Nottinghamshire to Oscytel, Archbishop of York, probably in support of a policy initiated by Eadwig of strengthening control over this area of Viking settlement by granting land in it to the archbishop.

== Consorts and children ==
Edgar had children by three consorts. Almost all historians accept that he married the third one, but some question whether he married the first one and others the second. Yorke sees a case for recognising three marriages, as well as temporary liaisons. The name of his first consort, who was the mother of his eldest son, Edward the Martyr, was not recorded until after the Norman Conquest. According to Osbern of Canterbury, writing in the late eleventh century, she was a nun who was seduced by Edgar, but this is rejected by later chroniclers, and historians generally accept the statements of the twelfth-century writers John of Worcester and William of Malmesbury that she was Æthelflæd Eneda, the daughter of Ordmær. Ann Williams describes her as his wife, but Cyril Hart says that Edward the Martyr was of doubtful legitimacy. The chroniclers described Ordmær as an ealdorman, but no ealdorman or thegn with that name attested any surviving tenth century charter. According to the , a (powerful man) called Ordmær and his wife Ealde exchanged land with Æthelstan Half-King, and Edgar may have met Æthelflæd when he was Æthelstan&#x27;s foster son. She probably died around 960. The historian Nicholas Brooks argues that Edgar must have married Æthelflæd because Dunstan backed her son&#x27;s succession to the throne, and he would not have supported an illegitimate son.

Edgar&#x27;s second consort was called Wulfthryth. According to the late eleventh century Benedictine writer Goscelin, Edgar wished to marry her cousin Saint Wulfhild, the daughter of a nobleman called Wulfhelm who had sent her to Wilton Abbey to be educated. Goscelin stated in his hagiography of Wulfhild that she resisted his determined advances as she wished to become a nun, and he agreed to marry Wulfthryth, who was also being educated at Wilton. They had a daughter, Edith. Williams regards it as uncertain whether they married, but Yorke argues that they did, pointing out that Goscelin stated that she and Edgar were &quot;bound by indissoluble vows&quot;, and that Edith&#x27;s personal seal, which still survives, describes her as the &quot;royal sister&quot; of Kings Edward and Æthelred, implying that they recognised her legitimacy. Wulfthryth returned to Wilton Abbey with her daughter by 964 and became a nun, allowing Edgar to remarry. He employed the Lotharingian scholar Radbod of Rheims, and the artist Benna of Trier, to educate Edith. Anglo-Saxon custom allowed for remarriage after a spouse entered a religious community, but on a strict interpretation of canon law, this was forbidden so long as the spouse lived, and so Edgar&#x27;s third marriage may have had political repercussions. Wulfthryth and Edith were both later regarded as saints, but Wulfthryth&#x27;s cult never became widely established, unlike that of Edith, who was the subject of another hagiography by Goscelin.

William of Malmesbury wrote that the Danish king Cnut had no affection for English saints, and &quot;when at Wilton one Whitsun he poured out his customary jeers at Edith herself: he would never credit the sanctity of the daughter of King Edgar, a vicious man, an especial slave to lust, and more tyrant than king&quot;. William claimed that Cnut ordered her tomb to be broken into so that she could prove her sanctity, and when this was done she threatened to attack him, terrifying him into submission. Yorke comments that the story has been used by William &quot;to highlight her father&#x27;s reputation for immorality&quot;. Yorke sees a provision in the that monasteries were under the protection of the king and nunneries of the queen to avoid scandal as &quot;a pointed reference to Edgar&#x27;s priapic interest in nuns&quot;, which would have been seen as normal royal behaviour by most people. Williams observes that &quot;the king&#x27;s devotion to the Benedictine reform movement should not be taken as evidence of high personal morals&quot;.

Edgar&#x27;s third consort was Ælfthryth, who was the widow of Ealdorman Æthelwold. He died in 962 and she married Edgar in 964. They had two sons, Edmund, who died young, and Æthelred, whose disastrous reign earned him the epithet of &quot;the Unready&quot;. In 966 she attested the Winchester New Minster Charter as the &quot;legitimate wife&quot; of the king, and her recently born elder son Edmund attested as his &quot;legitimate son&quot;, whereas Edward was described as &quot;begotten by the same king&quot;, but it is uncertain whether this was on the king&#x27;s instruction, which would indicate that he wished to cut Edward out of the succession, or was ordered by Bishop Æthelwold, who was a friend and ally of Ælfthryth. She was consecrated as queen in 973 and thereafter attested charters as , the first West Saxon queen to do so on a regular basis. Her consecration was a major change in status as previous West Saxon&#x27;s kings&#x27; consorts had only been described as the king&#x27;s wife, whereas she also had the status of being the queen.

Unlike Edgar&#x27;s earlier consorts, Ælfthryth became politically influential, and Edgar appointed her father, Ordgar, as ealdorman of Devon. Williams describes her as &quot;a force to be reckoned with&quot;; Pauline Stafford regards her as &quot;one of the most important tenth-century queens&quot; and comments that &quot;Ælfthryth, if not Eadgifu, heralded a new dawn in the history of English queens&quot;. Both women had a dominant position over other royal women, and both were most powerful as queen mothers, in Ælfthryth&#x27;s case during the minority of her son Æthelred. She was later accused of being responsible for the murder of Edward the Martyr to make her own son king.

== King of England ==
Edmund was killed in 946 trying to protect his seneschal from attack by an outlaw, and because his children were infants he was succeeded by his younger brother Eadred, who ruled until his death in 955. Edgar&#x27;s older brother, Eadwig, then became king and in 957 the kingdom was divided, Eadwig ruling south of the Thames and Edgar north of it. Historians disagree whether this was the result of a revolt by Edgar&#x27;s supporters against Eadwig&#x27;s incompetent rule or had been previously agreed.

=== Administration ===
Edgar became king of the whole of England when Eadwig died on 1 October 959, and his former tutor Æthelwold became one of the most powerful figures at court. He was probably in Edgar&#x27;s personal service as an adviser from 960 until 963, when the king appointed him Bishop of Winchester. Dunstan, who became Archbishop of Canterbury at the start of Edgar&#x27;s reign, was diligent in attending court, and in the historian Alan Thacker&#x27;s view: &quot;While Æthelwold&#x27;s characteristic context is his monastic empire, Dunstan&#x27;s is the royal court&quot;. In the early 970s the leading secular magnates were Æthelwine, Ealdorman of East Anglia (Æthelwold&#x27;s brother and successor), Ælfhere of Mercia, Oslac of York and Byrhtnoth of Essex.

The charters of the 960s and early 970s are similar and do not suggest political change in the period, but from the late 960s northern magnates were more regularly represented. In 954, Eadred had appointed Osulf, the ruler of the north Northumbrian territory of Bamburgh, as the ealdorman of the whole of Northumbria following the expulsion of the Viking king of York, Erik Bloodaxe. Osulf did not owe his power to southern English support, and when he died in the 960s Edgar again divided Northumbria and appointed Oslac as ealdorman of York (southern Northumbria), increasing his control over the area, but he was not able to choose who held power in Bamburgh.

Ealdormen were important in providing stability in a period when kings died young, but the families of Æthelwine of East Anglia and Ælfhere of Mercia gained unassailable positions and their rivalries were a threat to the stability of the kingdom. Edgar was able to keep them under control, but these tensions collapsed into open hostilities after his death. Ealdormen for areas south of the Thames do not attest after 970, and this may be because Edgar chose to govern these areas through royal officials of lower status. Reeves may have been entrusted with duties which were previously carried out by ealdormen. This made his rule less uniform, with different methods of government in different areas. The gap was filled after his death by the appointment of three new southern ealdormen.

Kingship was peripatetic. There was no fixed capital city and the court moved from one royal estate to another, four or five times a year. According to John of Worcester, each winter and spring Edgar would travel round the kingdom to enquire whether the statutes he had promulgated were being observed and whether the poor were being unjustly treated by the powerful. The historian Richard Huscroft describes this account as &quot;perhaps a little rose-tinted&quot;. Harrying was a standard punishment for crimes committed by communities, and in 974 Edgar ordered the people of Thanet to be deprived of their property and some of them executed, because they had robbed passing traders from York. Forfeiture of land for wrongdoing gave the king opportunities for patronage or receiving payments for remission of punishment. In one case, Edgar rescinded a forfeiture for 100 mancuses of gold, and in another he restored several confiscated estates for 120 mancuses.

=== Charters ===
Since the 930s, charters had been produced by a royal secretariat, but this probably did not survive the division of 957 to 959 in unchanged form. When Edgar succeeded in 959 he appears to have preferred to retain the secretariat he had employed as king of Mercia rather than use the one he had inherited from Eadwig. Edgar&#x27;s charters were written in competent but formulaic and derivative Latin, drawing on the prose of much earlier charters. They are more diverse in style than those of previous kings, and Snook argues that this does not indicate a decline in central control, but rather the increasing sophistication of the Anglo-Saxon bureaucracy. Although there is great variety in the charters&#x27; proems (introductions), and in the sanctions against anyone defying the provisions of the charter, the political and legal protocols follow a stable tradition.

The charters fall into several groups. Most belong to the &quot;diplomatic mainstream&quot;, including those produced by the scribe known as Edgar A. Scholars disagree about his location. in the 1930s and Pierre Chaplais in the 1960s linked the scribe with Æthelwold&#x27;s Abingdon, and perhaps with Æthelwold himself. Keynes argued in 1980 that he was probably a priest in the royal writing office, and Susan Kelly defended the older view in 2000. Edgar A started drafting when Edgar was king of Mercia and a significant proportion of charters in the early 960s were produced by him. He ceased work in 963, but some charters later in the reign were produced by scribes who adopted his style. Another group is associated with Dunstan and called the Dunstan B charters. They were produced between 951 and 975, with a break in Eadwig&#x27;s reign. The ones dating to the period when Edgar was only king of Mercia were not personally attested by him. There were also charters produced by midlands and west country agencies, and in some cases the beneficiary may have played an important role in the drafting.

Charters are problematic sources because of the difficulty of distinguishing genuine ones from the many forgeries. About 160 charters of Edgar survive, including 10 dating to 957 to 959 when he was king of Mercia. Most of the Mercian ones, and around 100 of those he issued as king of the English, are substantially genuine, the highest numbers being in 961 to 963 and 968. They are mainly standard grants of land to religious houses or individuals, with a few more complex ones such as the one granting privileges to the New Minster, Winchester (see image below). Most charters are only known from later copies, but sixteen survive as single sheets which are or may be originals. Some give Edgar&#x27;s regnal year, and the start date they were based on varied, some being from 959, 960 and 973, but most often 957. Like Æthelstan, Edgar used the title king of the English in some charters and king of Britain in other ones, and Keynes comments that &quot;the consistent usages of Edgar&#x27;s reign represent nothing less than a determined reaffirmation of the polity created by Æthelstan in the 930s&quot;.

=== Law ===
Four law codes have been attributed to Edgar, but the correct number is two. The &quot;Hundred Ordinance&quot; was formerly called I Edgar by historians, but it does not say who issued it, and it may date to an earlier king. II and III Edgar are the ecclesiastical and secular sections of one set of provisions, known as the Andover Code. IV Edgar is thus the second code. Edgar was more concerned with the administration of the law than its substance. His primary concern was to ensure that existing laws were properly enforced. Law codes were not unilateral royal pronouncements, but issued with the advice of the king&#x27;s councillors.

The legal historian Patrick Wormald describes the Andover Code as impressive and rational. II Edgar covers ecclesiastical matters, especially church dues. For the first time, a specific penalty was prescribed for non-payment of tithes, and anyone who did not pay Romescot, the penny due to the Pope, had to take it to Rome – a penalty theoretical rather than real. III Edgar is concerned with making justice accessible, preventing unjust judgments, standardisation of weights and measures, and that &quot;one coinage is to be current throughout all the king&#x27;s dominion&quot;. Plaintiffs had to exhaust other avenues before they were allowed recourse to the king, judgements had to be just and punishments had to be appropriate. Courts were to be held regularly, and every man was to provide himself with a surety to hold him to his legal duty. The preservation of order required the cooperation of the secular and religious authorities, but it is not until III Edgar that ealdormen and bishops were required to work together in the judgement of legal cases.

IV Edgar is more wordy than the Andover Code and more rhetorical than any previous one. It has attracted the most attention by historians as it recognises the separate customs of the former Viking Kingdom of York, which was to have &quot;such good laws as they best decide on&quot;. Wapentakes, the name in the northern Danelaw for the administrative divisions known to the Anglo-Saxons as hundreds, are first mentioned in this law code. One exception to the concession that the Danelaw was to have its own customs was a provision to make the sale of stolen goods more difficult. At least twelve sworn witnesses were to be appointed in each burh, hundred and wapentake, and all transactions had to be witnessed by two or three of these witnesses. Shires, hundreds and wapentakes began to play an important part in the king&#x27;s control over the population around this time. IV Edgar refers &quot;to all the nation, whether Englishmen, Danes or Britons, in every province of my dominion&quot;, recognising that Edgar&#x27;s subjects were made up of three distinct political communities. He ordered that many copies of the code be sent to ealdormen Ælfhere and Æthelwine, so that they can be widely distributed and made known to rich and poor.

The late tenth-century hagiographer, Lantfred of Winchester, writing at about the time that Edgar died, stated:
:At the command of the glorious King Edgar, a law ... was promulgated throughout England, to serve as a deterrent against all sorts of crime ... that if any thief or robber were found anywhere in the , he would be tortured at length by having his eyes put out, his hands cut off, his ears torn off, his nostrils carved open and his feet removed; and finally, with the skin and hair of his head shaved off, he would be abandoned in the open fields dead in respect of nearly all his limbs, to be devoured by wild beasts and birds and hounds of the night.

Edgar&#x27;s known laws do not specify mutilation, although IV Edgar does refer a list of punishments which does not survive. A code of Cnut specifies similar punishments, and its author, Archbishop Wulfstan of York, stated that Cnut&#x27;s legislation was based on the laws of Edgar. Wormald describes the punishments as &quot;ghastly&quot;, and Keynes observes that it is no wonder that Edgar was hailed as &quot;the strongest of all kings&quot;, but that if we are disposed to admire the peace he brought then we should bear in mind the measures he took to enforce it.

Cnut held up Edgar&#x27;s legislation as the precedent to be followed, and declared in a proclamation of 1020 that everyone should &quot;steadfastly observe the law of Edgar.&quot; &quot;ASC D&quot; states that in 1018 the Danes and the English reached an agreement &quot;according to Edgar&#x27;s law&quot;. In a letter from Cnut to his subjects in 1019/20, he referred to a law code agreed at Oxford, which he described as Edgar&#x27;s law, and urged people to keep to it. In Wormald&#x27;s view, Cnut considered that his regime was based on the Oxford agreement to keep to Edgar&#x27;s law. However, the code bears little resemblance to Edgar&#x27;s legislation, and the reference to him was probably symbolic as a revered lawmaker, rather than practical as a source. Edgar&#x27;s legislation continued to be held in high regard after the Norman Conquest, and the twelfth-century historian Eadmer referred to the &quot;holy laws&quot; of &quot;the most glorious king Edgar&quot;, although there is no evidence that he knew the codes.

=== Coinage ===
The only coin in common use in late Anglo-Saxon England was the silver penny, but a few halfpennies were also produced and nine are known for Edgar. Edgar&#x27;s coinage is divided into two phases, pre-reform which broadly carried on the diverse coinage design of his immediate predecessors, and the major reform near the end of his reign.

There had been an increase in regional variation in coinage in the reigns of Edmund and Eadred, especially in Northumbria, which switched back and forth between English and Viking control, and the permanent restoration of control over the north after 954 allowed a gradual return to the greater unity of Æthelstan&#x27;s coinage. Edgar&#x27;s pre-reform coin designs included Horizontal types, which continued from Eadwig&#x27;s reign. The Circumscription Cross type was introduced under Æthelstan and was rare for the next twenty years, before becoming common under Edgar. The Bust Crowned type (see image) also became much more common in Edgar&#x27;s reign. Edgar&#x27;s early coinage is described by Naismith as &quot;an important step towards the fundamental change&quot; of the reformed coinage. Æthelstan&#x27;s reign and Edgar&#x27;s pre-reform coinage are the only pre-reform periods when the mint place was commonly shown, and even in these periods many coins did not show the information. Thirty mint-places are named on Edgar&#x27;s pre-reform coins, and another six are inferred by numismatists for coins which do not show the town. There was a gradual decline in the standard of coinage from the reigns of Alfred and Edward the Elder until Edgar&#x27;s reform. In most of the first half of the tenth century the fineness of the coinage was maintained at a high level, with over 90% silver. A few less fine coins were produced in the 950s, and the number increased significantly in Edgar&#x27;s pre-reform coinage. The average weight of coins had gradually declined since the reign of Edward the Elder, and this continued into Edgar&#x27;s time.

Edgar&#x27;s reformed coinage brought in standardised designs over the whole country. It was modelled on Æthelstan&#x27;s coinage and had been partly prefigured in the previous fifteen years. It was of a high and uniform fineness (proportion of silver), compared both with the preceding period and with most other contemporary European coinages, with about 96% silver. The weight increased, but there were still regional variations. All mints used the same design, with the king&#x27;s bust facing left on the obverse in an inner circle with his name around the outside as +EADGAR REX ANGLOR[UM]. On the reverse was a small cross in the middle, surrounded by the moneyer&#x27;s name and the mint location. The design was not original: it was very similar to Æthelstan&#x27;s Bust Crowned coinage, but uniformity over the whole kingdom was completely new. The reform of the coinage is not recorded in documentary sources until the thirteenth century, when Roger of Wendover was the only chronicler to mention it. It is not known exactly when the reform was introduced, but it was towards the end of his reign. The fineness of coins became more geographically uneven after his death.

Edgar&#x27;s standardization of the coinage reflects his concern with uniformity, and his ability to impose the change shows the strength of his control. It was part of his determined effort towards the end of his reign to increase the secular and spiritual cohesion of his kingdom. For the first time, all of the approximately forty mints were producing a uniform design of coin. Edgar&#x27;s coinage reform is described by the historian Levi Roach as &quot;one of the crowning achievements of late Anglo-Saxon kingship&quot;. It lasted for more than one hundred and fifty years.

=== Religion ===
As king of Mercia in 958, Edgar granted land to St Werburgh&#x27;s Minster, Chester. This was an unreformed community, a house of secular clergy, and would have been an unlikely beneficiary of royal patronage later in Edgar&#x27;s reign. The Benedictine reformers later presented his accession as a victory for their cause, but this donation shows that monastic status was not then crucial for him and his advisers.

Earlier kings had supported reform, but there were only two Benedictine monasteries when Edgar came to the throne, and his support was key to the wider success of the movement. In Stenton&#x27;s view, his accession to the throne of England led to few changes in secular personnel, but it caused momentous changes in the church. He comments: &quot;There is no doubt that in the re-establishment of English monasticism, which is the principal achievement of this period, the enthusiasm of King Edgar was the decisive factor.&quot; He favoured all three of the leading figures in the movement, Dunstan, Oswald and Æthelwold. Oda had died in 958, and Eadwig&#x27;s choice of successor as Archbishop of Canterbury, Ælfsige, froze to death in the Alps on the way to get his pallium from the Pope. Byrhthelm, Bishop of Wells, was Eadwig&#x27;s second choice, but when Edgar succeeded, he dismissed Byrhthelm on the ground that he was too gentle to maintain discipline and appointed Dunstan. 
Oswald became bishop of Worcester in 962 and then archbishop of York in 971 without relinquishing Worcester.

In the early years of Edgar&#x27;s reign, the third monastic leader, Æthelwold, was the only abbot who attested charters, showing his special status. He was a strong critic of secular clergy (sometimes called canons), who were able to marry, unlike monks. Following his appointment as Bishop of Winchester in 963, Æthelwold converted the city&#x27;s New Minster into an institution exclusively of monks. Edgar successfully sought papal authority for the forcible expulsion of the canons and sent an armed force under a royal official to help in carrying it out. In 966, he granted privileges to the new community in a magnificent charter (see image), which referred to the cleansing of the church by the driving out of the canons and recorded the grant of the New Minster to Christ by Edgar, who is described as (vicar of Christ). One of the main justifications for the king&#x27;s involvement was that the canons&#x27; sinful nature meant that their prayers for him were worthless.

Edgar and Ælfthryth granted Æthelwold an estate at Sudbourne on condition that he translate the (Rule of Saint Benedict) from Latin into English to assist the religious instruction of the laity, and the translation survives. The laid down rules for English monasteries. It was written as a result of instructions sent by Edgar to a synod at Winchester to draw up a single monastic rule for all England, and it exhibits his desire for unity and uniformity. He urged his bishops, abbots and abbesses, &quot;to be of one mind regarding monastic usage ... lest differing ways of observing the customs of one Rule and one country should bring their holy conversation into disrepute&quot;. The instructed that psalms be said several times a day for the king and queen in all monasteries, and required the consent of the king for the election of abbots. The document dates to around 973, perhaps after Edgar&#x27;s coronation in Bath on 11 May.

Continental reformers accepted that secular clergy had their place in the church, and Dunstan and Oswald agreed. They did not expel the canons from their cathedral communities. Æthelwold was more extreme, and in a text known as &quot;King Edgar&#x27;s Establishment of Monasteries&quot;, he wrote that Edgar:
:cleansed holy places from all men&#x27;s foulnesses, not only in the kingdom of the West Saxons but in the land of the Mercians also. Assuredly he drove out canons who abounded beyond measure in the aforesaid sins, and he established monks in the foremost places of all his dominion for the glorious service of the Saviour Christ. In some places also he established nuns and entrusted them to his consort, Ælfthryth, that she might help them in every necessity.

The reformers practised personal austerity, but their masses, liturgy and prayers became more and more lavish along Continental lines, and they worked vigorously to increase the land and wealth of the monasteries to pay for the buildings and objects required. The reformers did not only receive physical and financial support from Edgar and his officials, but also from other members of the laity. In addition, the leaders of the movement were wealthy aristocrats who used their own resources to support the movement. Æthelwold paid Edgar 200 mancuses of gold and a silver cup worth five pounds to renew privileges of Winchester Old Minster, granted by Edward the Elder, in relation to a large estate at Taunton, and Æthelwold also paid Ælfthryth 50 mancuses &quot;in return for her help in his just mission&quot;. Æthelwold relentlessly pursued land claims through the courts on behalf of monasteries in his diocese, and Edgar frequently intervened to support him. After his death landowners brought legal actions, and sometimes used violence, to recover estates lost by the aggressive and dubious claims of monasteries. Even the greatest magnates were not immune from the reformers&#x27; demands, and Æthelwine brought a successful action to recover an estate of forty hides in Hatfield, complaining that Edgar had forced him and his brothers to surrender it to Æthelwold. The anti-monastic reaction following Edgar&#x27;s death shows how dependent the reformers were on the king&#x27;s support, but no writings survive of the reformers&#x27; opponents to show how they saw Edgar.

Edgar&#x27;s support for the reformers earned him extravagant praise in the works of Benedictine authors such as Byrhtferth and Wulfstan, both writing in the late 990s. The reformers gave Edgar a status which was almost theocratic, and he is compared in the to the Good Shepherd. The contemporary theologian Ælfric of Eynsham also praised Edgar; he urged obedience to monarchy, which he regarded as divinely instituted. The historian Catherine Karkov observes that: &quot;From the very beginning of his reign Edgar had been portrayed as an able and powerful , whose kingship derived directly from God&quot;. The reform was the English branch of a European movement, and monasteries in post-Carolingian Europe universally followed the , but Wormald comments that &quot;England was the only place in post-Carolingian Europe where monastic uniformity was a matter of political principle&quot;.

Like other kings, Edgar was generous in his donations to churches. In 970 Æthelwold re-founded the community of secular priests at Ely Abbey as a house for monks with the generous support of Edgar, whose gifts included a cross covered in gold and silver gilt, together with golden images and precious stones; a cloak embellished with gold; and a gospel book gilded with precious stones and enamels. He was a major patron of Romsey Abbey, a Benedictine nunnery which was founded or refounded in 967, and his son Edmund was buried there. Edgar also supported the Old Minster, Winchester, which had the body of Saint Swithun. In 971, the saint&#x27;s body was translated from its tomb in the grounds to one inside the minster, on the order of Edgar and with the support of Æthelwold. This was the start of a major new cult. A second translation was carried out in around 974. Swithun&#x27;s relics were carried in a barefoot procession for three miles before being placed in a grand new reliquary of gold, silver and rubies which Edgar had ordered to be made. He was also the greatest benefactor of Æthelwold&#x27;s Abingdon Abbey.

Reformed Benedictine monasteries were mainly confined to Wessex and some areas of Mercia, and they were greatly outnumbered by the many secular minsters, although the reformed monasteries were much wealthier. The reformers portrayed Edgar&#x27;s reign as a golden age which fundamentally changed the English church, but the historian John Blair is sceptical: &quot;The polemic may belie a religious culture in Edgar&#x27;s reign which, when we probe beneath the surface, starts to look less exclusive and more like that of Æthelstan&#x27;s and Edmund&#x27;s.&quot;

=== Learning and art ===
When Alfred came to the throne in 871, learning had declined to a low level and the knowledge of Latin was very poor. He started the revival of learning, and it was brought to its height by Edgar. Lapidge comments that his reign &quot;marks a decisive turning-point in English literary history&quot;. No Latin works by Oswald are known, but Æthelwold and Dunstan were outstanding scholars. Æthelwold&#x27;s translation of the is of the highest standard, and his New Minster Charter was written in elaborate hermeneutic Latin to display the dazzling erudition of the Benedictine movement and glorify King Edgar and the reform. Some of the works in Old English produced by Æthelwold are so lavishly and expensively produced that they cannot have been for the instruction of young oblates and were probably intended for nobles and royalty. There was also a great increase in Latin literature in Edgar&#x27;s reign, all of it apparently associated with Æthelwold&#x27;s Winchester. Much of this literature consisted of poetry, often containing many grecisms. The three leading reformers were strongly influenced by Continental scholarship and welcomed learned foreign clerics, such as Lantfred from Fleury Abbey, to their households. The art historian David Wilson states that Edgar&#x27;s reign &quot;produced some of the highest achievements in painting and sculpture ever seen in England&quot;. The Benedictional of St. Æthelwold is one of the greatest examples of English art. Several half-sisters of Edgar&#x27;s father had married Continental royalty, and these connections helped Edgar to bring in foreign scholars such as Radbod and painters and goldsmiths such as Benna, who made metalwork for the king and decorated the ceiling of Wilton church.

=== Warfare and foreign relations ===
Peter Rex observes in his biography of Edgar that his reign was remarkable for the lack of opposition to his rule both from within and outside his kingdom. Although no Viking attacks on England are recorded in his reign, there were several battles fought by ealdormen and neighbouring kings. In 966, Thored, son of Gunnar, ravaged Westmorland, perhaps as part of English resistance to the southward expansion of Strathclyde, and King Kenneth of Scotland conducted raids on Northumbria in the early 970s. In the late 960s, there was dissension between the princes of the north Welsh Kingdom of Gwynedd, and in 967, the English under Ælfhere laid waste to it; in the early 970s, Anglesey was twice attacked by the Vikings. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; boasted of the strength of Edgar&#x27;s navy. &quot;ASC D&quot; and &quot;E&quot;, after declaring that many kings honoured Edgar, go on: &quot;Nor was there fleet so proud nor host so strong that it got itself prey in England as long as the noble king held the throne.&quot; Later chroniclers made exaggerated claims, such as John of Worcester, who wrote that Edgar had 3,600 ships, and that he used to circumnavigate the island of Britain each summer, but there is evidence for naval organisation in the reign of his son Æthelred, and Edgar probably had a substantial fleet which laid the foundation for it.

A poem in the northern versions &quot;ASC D&quot; and &quot;E&quot;, which is thought on stylistic grounds to have been written by Wulfstan, praises Edgar, but then goes on &quot;Yet he did one ill-deed too greatly: he loved evil foreign customs and brought too firmly heathen manners within this land, and attracted hither foreigners and enticed harmful people to this country.&quot; This probably refers to Edgar hiring Viking mercenaries and their ships, an expedient which was employed by Alfred and probably Æthelstan before Edgar, and Æthelred after him.

In 972/973, Edgar sent an embassy to the German emperor, Otto the Great. According to Byrhtferth:
:Edgar sent some wonderful gifts to the emperor, through the agency of Abbot Æscwig and Wulfmær, his thegn; they brought back to him even more wonderful gifts, which served to establish a treaty of steadfast peace. The king was bountiful in his generosity, as befits a king. As a result of his abundant generosity, the kings of other peoples praised him exceedingly, and because he displayed the rage of a savage lion against his enemies, neighbouring kings and princes feared him.

=== The events of 973 ===
Naismith describes the year 973 as an for the English kingdom. Edgar and Ælfryth were consecrated king and queen at Bath on Whit Sunday, 11 May 973. Kings were normally formally elected by their leading men and then crowned soon after their accession, but there is no record of Edgar being crowned early in his reign. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; implies that it was a first coronation. &quot;ASC A&quot;, &quot;ASC B&quot; and &quot;ASC C&quot; say &quot;Edmund&#x27;s son, bold in battle, had spent 29 years in the world when this came about, and then in the thirtieth was consecrated king.&quot;; &quot;ASC D&quot; and &quot;ASC E&quot; describe him as &quot;the Edgar&quot;. Historians debate whether it was a second coronation, and if not, the reason for the delay. One theory is that he waited until he was in his thirtieth year because thirty was the minimum age for consecration as a priest, but this has been questioned because at twenty-nine he was still too young. According to Nicholas, a twelfth-century prior of Worcester, Edgar postponed his consecration until he had outgrown the passions of his youth, and Stenton thinks that he may have waited &quot;until he felt that he had come to full maturity of mind and conduct&quot;. Other historians, such as Janet Nelson, think that he was almost certainly crowned at the start of his reign. She argues that Edgar must have been crowned early in his reign because his legitimacy as king would otherwise have been impaired, and that the 973 consecration was intended to celebrate and display his claim to imperial status as overlord of Britain.&quot; The fact that it was recorded in verse in early versions of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; (&quot;ASC A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;), whereas it was rare for the &quot;Chronicle&quot; to mention coronations at all, suggests that there was something special about this one. The German court was the leader in elaborate ritual and display, and the information learned by Edgar&#x27;s embassy to Otto I may have played a major role in planning the coronation in Bath.

A northern version of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; dating to the second half of the eleventh or early twelfth centuries, &quot;ASC D&quot;, says that Edgar then sailed with his navy to Chester, where six kings promised to be his allies on land and sea. Ælfric of Eynsham, writing no more than twenty-five years later, apparently about the same event, says that &quot;all the kings who were in this island, Cumbrians and Scots, came to Edgar, once eight kings on one day, and they all submitted to Edgar&#x27;s direction&quot;. In the twelfth century, John of Worcester and William of Malmesbury gave accounts of the Chester meeting. They stated that the kings rowed Edgar on the River Dee as a symbol of their submission. Unlike earlier sources, they name the kings, and the historian of Wales Thomas Charles-Edwards gives their probable identities: Kenneth of Scotland, Dufnal and his son Malcolm of Strathclyde, Maccus, King of the Isles, Iacob and his nephew Hywel of Gwynedd, and two who are otherwise unknown, Siferth, who may have been a Viking, and Iuchil, perhaps a version of the Old Welsh name . John of Worcester gives the fullest account, stating that the kings, who he calls underkings:
:went to meet him, as he had commanded, and swore that they would be loyal to, and cooperate with, him by land and sea. With them, on a certain day, he boarded a skiff; having set them to the oars, and having taken the helm himself, he skilfully steered it through the course of the River Dee, and with a crowd of ealdormen and nobles following in a similar boat, sailed from the palace to the monastery of St John the Baptist, where, when he had prayed, he returned with the same pomp to the palace. As he was entering it he is reported to have declared to his nobles at length that each of his successors would be able to boast that he was king of the English, and would enjoy the pomp of such honour with so many kings at his command.

Some historians see the meeting as a parley between equals. The Chester meeting may have been a conference of kings following the English attacks on Wales and Scottish on England. Lothian had probably been under Scottish control since the 950s, and around this time Edgar formally ceded it to them. Kenneth may have attended the meeting to secure this concession and in Williams&#x27;s view it is unlikely that he saw himself as Edgar&#x27;s subordinate. The historian Christopher Lewis comments: &quot;Precisely what happened at Chester has been irretrievably obscured by the embellishments of twelfth-century historians&quot;.

Other historians are more ready to accept claims of English superiority. Levi Roach and Richard Huscroft think that it makes better sense to see the events at Chester as a display of Edgar&#x27;s overlordship. Molyneaux agrees, arguing that the English king was able to intimidate other rulers because he possessed far greater military strength: &quot;If Edgar&#x27;s neighbours wished to avoid their lands being ravaged, the invitation to Chester was probably not one that they could decline.&quot; Edgar claimed dominion over Britain by describing himself as ruler of &quot;Britannia&quot; and &quot;Albion&quot; in charters. Such claims, which are also found in the writings of the monastic reformers, are displayed in the titles of other tenth-century kings. They reached a peak during Edgar&#x27;s reign, but in reality English power over the other nations of Britain was lower than at times earlier in the century. Scottish and Welsh kings sometimes attested Æthelstan&#x27;s charters, but never those of Edgar. His coronation at Bath was only attended by English magnates, whereas at least two Welsh kings were present at that of Eadred in 946. After his reign, southern kings&#x27; hegemony over other parts of Britain weakened further, and there is no evidence of Scottish, Welsh or Cumbrian kings acknowledging English overlordship until 1031.

== Death and aftermath ==
Edgar was thirty-one or thirty-two years old when he died on 8 July 975. He was buried at Glastonbury Abbey, which was the burial place of his father and a monastery particularly associated with Dunstan and Benedictine reform. His burial at Glastonbury helped to make it a leading royal cult centre, although there is no evidence that he was revered as a saint earlier than the mid-eleventh century. The historian David Rollason comments that his cult had surprisingly little success in view of his role in monastic reform, &quot;although presumably weakened by stories of his sexual adventures, notably with nuns&quot;. He is listed as a saint in some modern Catholic sources with a feast day of 8 July. Two of his children, Edith and Edward, were widely revered as saints shortly after their deaths.

The succession to the throne was disputed between the supporters of his two surviving sons. Æthelred had the powerful backing of his mother and her ally, Bishop Æthelwold, but Edgar&#x27;s eldest son Edward became king with the support of Dunstan and Æthelwine. The dispute was personal, between the supporters of Edward and Æthelred, not between the supporters and opponents of monastic reform. The fact that there was no question of dividing the country between the two claimants may be a tribute to the success of Edgar&#x27;s reforms aimed at unifying the country. Edward was murdered in 978 and he was succeeded by Æthelred, whose disastrous reign ended with the Danish conquest of England.

== Assessment ==
The historian Judith Green describes Edgar&#x27;s reign as &quot;in many respects the apogee of Old English kingship&quot;, and Eric John comments that it &quot;marks the high point in the history of the Anglo-Saxon state. One sign of this is, paradoxically, that we know little of secular events in Edgar&#x27;s time. Violent incident was staple fare for annalists.&quot; Other historians also praise Edgar. Levi Roach sees his reign as &quot;noteworthy for its stability, as both monastic reform and administrative developments served to provide a more secure basis for a unified kingdom. In the view of Martin Ryan: &quot;By the end of the reign of King Edgar, Anglo-Saxon England possessed a sophisticated machinery of rule, capable of significant and, in medieval terms, precocious administrative feats.&quot; In Molyneaux&#x27;s view, the mid-to late-tenth century was a crucial period for administrative development. However, it is uncertain how far Edgar was personally responsible: &quot;This period, far more than the reigns of either Alfred or Æthelstan, was probably the most pivotal phase in the development of the institutional structures that were fundamental to royal rule in the eleventh century English kingdom&quot;. The fact that such a major change as his reform of the currency was not recorded until after the Conquest suggests that other important changes in his reign may have been wrongly attributed to the later time when they were first recorded.

Stenton&#x27;s praise is more moderate. He describes Edgar&#x27;s reign as &quot;singularly devoid of recorded incident&quot;, which he attributes to Edgar&#x27;s competence as a ruler, but he also writes that: 
:when Edgar is compared with other outstanding members of his house – with Alfred or with Æthelstan – he falls at once into a lower class than theirs. He was never required to defend English civilization against barbarians from over sea, nor to deal with the problems raised by the existence of barbarian states within England itself. His part in history was to maintain the peace established in England by earlier kings.

Some historians are more critical. Keynes comments: &quot;It is a sign of Edgar&#x27;s &#x27;strength&#x27; as a ruler that when he died, on 8 July 975, the &quot;peace&quot; of his kingdom was immediately disturbed ... In general terms, the disturbances of Edward&#x27;s reign should be regarded as a manifestation of the kind of social and political disorder which might be expected to attend the unexpected removal of one who was seen as the personification of an overbearing regime.&quot; His rule appears to have depended to a great degree on his personal control, which makes it understandable that his death should have created so many problems. Williams takes a similar view, and Snook argues that the infighting after his death and the disintegration of the state under his son Æthelred shows that the factionalism of the 950s had only been temporarily suppressed by Edgar. Commenting on the flattering portrait of Edgar by monastic writers, Stafford comments: &quot;Sparse sources make the construction of any alternative to this plaster saint of monastic hagiography difficult.&quot;

Almost all of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; is in prose, but three tenth-century kings are the subjects of panegyric poems. Two are about specific events, Æthelstan&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Brunanburh in 937 and Edmund&#x27;s recovery of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw in 942, whereas three are general, all of them commemorating Edgar&#x27;s reign. They are placed in the years of his accession, coronation and death, and the historian Mercedes Salvador-Bello sees them as products of monastic reformers who celebrated him as a patron of their cause and compared him to Christ. After the troubles of the reigns of Edgar&#x27;s sons, his rule came to be seen as a golden age, but his byname, , is not recorded until the twelfth-century, in the chronicle of John of Worcester. Its translation as &quot;Peaceful&quot; is common in popular sources, but very rare in academic works on the period. The historian Sean Miller argues that as Edgar was very ready to resort to violence, the term is better translated as &quot;peacemaker&quot;, someone who preserved peace through &quot;strict control backed up by military force rather than serenity of character&quot;.

<text>In Greek mythology, the Titans ( ; ) were the pre-Olympian gods. According to the &quot;Theogony&quot; of Hesiod, they were the twelve children of the primordial parents Uranus (Sky) and Gaia (Earth). The six male Titans were Oceanus, Coeus, Crius, Hyperion, Iapetus, and Cronus; the six female Titans—called the Titanides () or Titanesses—were Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, and Tethys.

After Cronus mated with his older sister Rhea, she bore the first generation of Olympians; the six siblings Zeus, Hades, Poseidon, Hestia, Demeter, and Hera. Certain other descendants of the Titans, such as Prometheus, Atlas, Helios, and Leto, are sometimes also called Titans.

The Titans were the former gods: the generation of gods preceding the Olympians. They were overthrown as part of the Greek succession myth, which tells how Cronus seized power from his father Uranus and ruled the cosmos with his fellow Titans before being in turn defeated and replaced as the ruling pantheon of gods by Zeus and the Olympians in a ten-year war called the &quot;Titanomachy&quot; (&#x27;battle of the Titans&#x27;). As a result of this war, the vanquished Titans were banished from the upper world and held imprisoned under guard in Tartarus. Some Titans were apparently allowed to remain free.

==Genealogy==
===Hesiod&#x27;s genealogy ===
According to Hesiod, the Titan offspring of Uranus and Gaia were Oceanus, Coeus, Crius, Hyperion, Iapetus, Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, Tethys, and Cronus. Eight of the Titan brothers and sisters married each other: Oceanus and Tethys, Coeus and Phoebe, Hyperion and Theia, and Cronus and Rhea. The other two Titan brothers married outside their immediate family. Iapetus married his niece Clymene, the daughter of Oceanus and Tethys, while Crius married his half-sister Eurybia, the daughter of Gaia and Pontus. The two remaining Titan sisters, Themis and Mnemosyne, became wives of their nephew Zeus.

From Oceanus and Tethys came the three thousand river gods, and three thousand Oceanid nymphs. From Coeus and Phoebe came Leto, another wife of Zeus, and Asteria. From Crius and Eurybia came Astraeus, Pallas, and Perses. From Hyperion and Theia came the celestial personifications Helios (Sun), Selene (Moon), and Eos (Dawn). From Iapetus and Clymene came Atlas, Menoetius, Prometheus, and Epimetheus. From Cronus and Rhea came the Olympians: Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon, and Zeus. By Zeus, Themis bore the three Horae (Hours), and the three Moirai (Fates), and Mnemosyne bore the nine Muses.

While the descendants of the Titans Oceanus and Tethys, Cronus and Rhea, Themis, and Mnemosyne (i.e. the river gods, the Oceanids, the Olympians, the Horae, the Moirai, and the Muses) are not normally considered to be Titans, descendants of the other Titans, notably: Leto, Helios, Atlas, and Prometheus, are themselves sometimes referred to as Titans.









===Variations===

Passages in a section of the &quot;Iliad&quot; called the Deception of Zeus suggest the possibility that Homer knew of a tradition in which Oceanus and Tethys (rather than Uranus and Gaia, as in Hesiod) were the parents of the Titans. Twice Homer has Hera describe the pair as &quot;Oceanus, from whom the gods are sprung, and mother Tethys&quot;, while in the same passage Hypnos describes Oceanus as &quot;from whom they all are sprung&quot;.

Plato, in his &quot;Timaeus&quot;, provides a genealogy (probably Orphic) which perhaps reflected an attempt to reconcile this apparent divergence between Homer and Hesiod, with Uranus and Gaia as the parents of Oceanus and Tethys, and Oceanus and Tethys as the parents of Cronus and Rhea &quot;and all that go with them&quot;, plus Phorcys. In his &quot;Cratylus&quot;, Plato quotes Orpheus as saying that Oceanus and Tethys were &quot;the first to marry&quot;, possibly also reflecting an Orphic theogony in which Oceanus and Tethys, rather than Uranus and Gaia, were the primeval parents. To Hesiod&#x27;s twelve Titans, the mythographer Apollodorus, adds a thirteenth Titan, Dione, the mother of Aphrodite by Zeus. Plato&#x27;s inclusion of Phorkys, apparently, as a Titan, and the mythographer Apollodorus&#x27;s inclusion of Dione, suggests an Orphic tradition in which the canonical twelve Titans consisted of Hesiod&#x27;s twelve with Phorkys and Dione taking the place of Oceanus and Tethys.

The Roman mythographer Hyginus, in his somewhat confused genealogy, after listing as offspring of Aether (Upper Sky) and Earth (Gaia), Ocean [Oceanus], Themis, Tartarus, and Pontus, next lists &quot;the Titans&quot;, followed by two of Hesiod&#x27;s Hundred-Handers: Briareus and Gyges, one of Hesiod&#x27;s three Cyclopes: Steropes, then continues his list with Atlas, Hyperion and Polus, Saturn [Cronus], Ops [Rhea], Moneta, Dione, and the three Furies: Alecto, Megaera, and Tisiphone. The geographer Pausanias, mentions seeing the image of a man in armor, who was supposed to be the Titan Anytos, who was said to have raised the Arcadian Despoina.

==Former gods==
The Titans, as a group, represent a pre-Olympian order. Hesiod uses the expression &quot;the former gods&quot; () in reference to the Titans. They were the banished gods, who were no longer part of the upper world. Rather they were the gods who dwelt underground in Tartarus, and as such, they may have been thought of as &quot;gods of the underworld&quot;, who were the antithesis of, and in opposition to, the Olympians, the gods of the heavens. Hesiod called the Titans &quot;earth-born&quot; (chthonic), and in the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Apollo&quot;, Hera prays to the Titans &quot;who dwell beneath the earth&quot;, calling on them to aid her against Zeus, just as if they were chthonic spirits. In a similar fashion, in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Hera, upon swearing an oath by the underworld river Styx, &quot;invoked by name all the gods below Tartarus, that are called Titans&quot; as witnesses.

They were the older gods, but not, apparently, as was once thought, the old gods of an indigenous group in Greece, historically displaced by the new gods of Greek invaders. Rather, they were a group of gods, whose mythology at least, seems to have been borrowed from the Near East (see &quot;Near East origins,&quot; below). These imported gods gave context and provided a backstory for the Olympian gods, explaining where these Greek Olympian gods had come from, and how they had come to occupy their position of supremacy in the cosmos. The Titans were the previous generation, and family of gods, whom the Olympians had to overthrow, and banish from the upper world, in order to become the ruling pantheon of Greek gods.

For Hesiod, possibly in order to match the twelve Olympian gods, there were twelve Titans: six males and six females, with some of Hesiod&#x27;s names perhaps being mere poetic inventions, so as to arrive at the right number. In Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, apart from Cronus, the Titans play no part at all in the overthrow of Uranus, and we only hear of their collective action in the Titanomachy, their war with the Olympians. As a group, they have no further role in conventional Greek myth, nor do they play any part in Greek cult.

As individuals, few of the Titans have any separate identity. Aside from Cronus, the only other figure Homer mentions by name as being a Titan is Iapetus. Some Titans seem only to serve a genealogical function, providing parents for more important offspring: Coeus and Phoebe as the parents of Leto, the mother, by Zeus, of the Olympians Apollo and Artemis; Hyperion and Theia as the parents of Helios, Selene and Eos; Iapetus as the father of Atlas and Prometheus; and Crius as the father of three sons Astraeus, Pallas, and Perses, who themselves seem only to exist to provide fathers for more important figures such as the Anemoi (Winds), Nike (Victory), and Hecate.

==Overthrown==
The Titans play a key role in an important part of Greek mythology, the succession myth. It told how the Titan Cronus, the youngest of the Titans, overthrew Uranus, and how in turn Zeus, by waging and winning a great ten-year war pitting the new gods against the old gods, called the Titanomachy (&quot;Titan war&quot;), overthrew Cronus and his fellow Titans, and was eventually established as the final and permanent ruler of the cosmos.

===Hesiod===
According to the standard version of the succession myth, given in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, Uranus initially produced eighteen children with Gaia: the twelve Titans, the three Cyclopes, and the three Hecatoncheires (Hundred-Handers), but hating them, he hid them away somewhere inside Gaia. Angry and in distress, Gaia fashioned a sickle made of adamant and urged her children to punish their father. Only her son Cronus was willing. So Gaia hid Cronus in &quot;ambush&quot;, gave him an adamantine sickle, and when Uranus came to lie with Gaia, Cronus reached out and castrated his father. This enabled the Titans to be born and Cronus to assume supreme command of the cosmos, with the Titans as his subordinates.

Cronus, having now taken over control of the cosmos from Uranus, wanted to ensure that he maintained control. Uranus and Gaia had prophesied to Cronus that one of Cronus&#x27; own children would overthrow him, so when Cronus married Rhea, he made sure to swallow each of the children she birthed. This he did with the first five: Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon (in that order), to Rhea&#x27;s great sorrow. However, when Rhea was pregnant with Zeus, Rhea begged her parents Gaia and Uranus to help her save Zeus. So they sent Rhea to Lyctus on Crete to bear Zeus, and Gaia took the newborn Zeus to raise, hiding him deep in a cave beneath Mount Aigaion. Meanwhile, Rhea gave Cronus a huge stone wrapped in baby&#x27;s clothes which he swallowed thinking that it was another of Rhea&#x27;s children.

Zeus, now grown, forced Cronus (using some unspecified trickery of Gaia) to disgorge his other five children. Zeus then released his uncles the Cyclopes (apparently still imprisoned beneath the earth, along with the Hundred-Handers, where Uranus had originally confined them) who then provide Zeus with his great weapon, the thunderbolt, which had been hidden by Gaia. A great war was begun, the Titanomachy, for control of the cosmos. The Titans fought from Mount Othrys, while the Olympians fought from Mount Olympus. In the tenth year of that great war, following Gaia&#x27;s counsel, Zeus released the Hundred-Handers, who joined the war against the Titans, helping Zeus to gain the upper hand. Zeus cast the fury of his thunderbolt at the Titans, defeating them and throwing them into Tartarus, with the Hundred-Handers as their guards.

===Homer===
Only brief references to the Titans and the succession myth are found in Homer. In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Homer tells us that &quot;the gods ... that are called Titans&quot; reside in Tartarus. Specifically, Homer says that &quot;Iapetus and Cronos ... have joy neither in the rays of Helios Hyperion [the Sun] nor in any breeze, but deep Tartarus is round about them&quot;, and further, that Zeus &quot;thrust Cronos down to dwell beneath earth and the unresting sea.&quot;

===Other early sources===
Brief mentions of the Titanomachy and the imprisonment of the Titans in Tartarus also occur in the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Apollo&quot; and Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;. 
In the &quot;Hymn&quot;, Hera, angry at Zeus, calls upon the &quot;Titan gods who dwell beneath the earth about great Tartarus, and from whom are sprung both gods and men&quot;.

In &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, Prometheus (the son of the Titan Iapetus) refers to the Titanomachy, and his part in it:
===Apollodorus===
The mythographer Apollodorus, gives a similar account of the succession myth to Hesiod&#x27;s, but with a few significant differences. According to Apollodorus, there were thirteen original Titans, adding the Titaness Dione to Hesiod&#x27;s list. The Titans (instead of being Uranus&#x27; firstborn as in Hesiod) were born after the three Hundred-Handers and the three Cyclopes, and while Uranus imprisoned these first six of his offspring, he apparently left the Titans free. Not just Cronus, but all the Titans, except Oceanus, attacked Uranus. After Cronus castrated Uranus, the Titans freed the Hundred-Handers and Cyclopes (unlike in Hesiod, where they apparently remained imprisoned), and made Cronus their sovereign, who then reimprisoned the Hundred-Handers and Cyclopes in Tartarus.

Although Hesiod does not say how Zeus was eventually able to free his siblings, according to Apollodorus, Zeus was aided by Oceanus&#x27; daughter Metis, who gave Cronus an emetic which forced him to disgorge his children that he had swallowed. According to Apollodorus, in the tenth year of the ensuing war, Zeus learned from Gaia, that he would be victorious if he had the Hundred-Handers and the Cyclopes as allies. So Zeus slew their warder Campe (a detail not found in Hesiod) and released them, and in addition to giving Zeus his thunderbolt (as in Hesiod), the Cyclopes also gave Poseidon his trident, and Hades his helmet, and &quot;with these weapons the gods overcame the Titans, shut them up in Tartarus, and appointed the Hundred-handers their guards&quot;.

===Hyginus===
The Roman mythographer Hyginus, in his &quot;Fabulae&quot;, gives an unusual (and perhaps confused) account of the Titanomachy. According to Hyginus the Titanomachy came about because of a dispute between Jupiter and Juno (the Roman equivalents of Zeus and Hera). Juno, Jupiter&#x27;s jealous wife, was angry at her husband, on account of Jupiter&#x27;s son Epaphus by Io (one of her husband&#x27;s many lovers). Because of this Juno incited the Titans to rebel against Jupiter and restore Saturn (Cronus) to the kingship of the gods. Jupiter, with the help of Minerva (Athena), Apollo, and Diana (Artemis), put down the rebellion, and hurled the Titans (as in other accounts) down to Tartarus.

==After the Titanomachy==
After being overthrown in the Titanomachy, Cronus and his fellow vanquished Titans were cast into Tartarus:
However, besides Cronus, exactly which of the other Titans were supposed to have been imprisoned in Tartarus is unclear. The only original Titan, mentioned by name, as being confined with Cronus in Tartarus, is Iapetus.

But, not all the Titans were imprisoned there. Certainly Oceanus, the great world encircling river, seems to have remained free, and in fact, seems not to have fought on the Titans&#x27; side at all. In Hesiod, Oceanus sends his daughter Styx, with her children Zelus (Envy), Nike (Victory), Kratos (Power), and Bia (Force), to fight on Zeus&#x27; side against the Titans, while in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Hera says that, during the Titanomachy, she was cared for by Oceanus and his wife the Titaness Tethys. Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, has Oceanus free to visit his nephew Prometheus sometime after the war. Like Oceanus, Helios, the Titan son of Hyperion, certainly remained free to drive his sun-chariot daily across the sky, taking an active part in events subsequent to the Titanomachy. The freedom of Oceanus, along with Helios (Sun), and perhaps Hyperion (to the extent that he also represented the Sun), would seem to be the result of cosmological necessity, for how could a world encircling river, or the Sun, be confined in Tartarus?

As for other male offspring of the Titans, some seem to have participated in the Titanomachy, and were punished as a result, and others did not, or at least (like Helios) remained free. Three of Iapetus&#x27; sons, Atlas, Menoetius, and Prometheus are specifically connected by ancient sources with the war. In the &quot;Theogony&quot; both Atlas and Menoetius received punishments from Zeus, but Hesiod does not say for what crime exactly they were punished. Atlas was famously punished by Zeus, by being forced to hold up the sky on his shoulders, but none of the early sources for this story (Hesiod, Homer, Pindar, and Aeschylus) say that his punishment was as a result of the war. According to Hyginus however, Atlas led the Titans in a revolt against Zeus (Jupiter). The &quot;Theogony&quot; has Menoetius struck down by Zeus&#x27; thunderbolt and cast into Erebus &quot;because of his mad presumption and exceeding pride&quot;. Whether Hesiod was using Erebus as another name for Tartarus (as was sometimes done), or meant that Menoetius&#x27;s punishment was because of his participation in the Titanomachy is unclear, and no other early source mentions this event, however Apollodorus says that it was. Hesiod does not mention Prometheus in connection with the Titanomachy, but Prometheus does remain free, in the &quot;Theogony&quot;, for his deception of Zeus at Mecone and his subsequent theft of fire, for which transgressions Prometheus was famously punished by Zeus by being chained to a rock where an eagle came to eat his &quot;immortal liver&quot; every day, which then grew back every night. However Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; (as mentioned above) does have Prometheus say that he was an ally of Zeus during the Titanomachy.
The female Titans, to the extent that they are mentioned at all, appear also to have been allowed to remain free. Three of these, according to the &quot;Theogony&quot;, become wives of Zeus: Themis, Mnemosyne, and Leto, the daughter of the Titans Coeus and Phoebe. Themis gives birth to the three Horae (Hours), and the three Moirai (Fates), and Mnemosyne gives birth to the nine Muses. Leto, who gives birth to the Olympians Apollo and Artemis, takes an active part on the side of the Trojans in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, and is also involved in the story of the giant Tityos. Tethys, presumably along with her husband Oceanus, took no part in the war, and, as mentioned above, provided safe refuge for Hera during the war. Rhea remains free and active after the war: appearing at Leto&#x27;s delivery of Apollo, as Zeus&#x27; messenger to Demeter announcing the settlement concerning Persephone, bringing Pelops back to life.

===Possible release===
While in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, and Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, Cronus and the other Titans are confined to Tartarus—apparently forever—another tradition, as indicated by later sources, seems to have had Cronus, or other of the Titans, being eventually set free. Pindar, in one of his poems (462 BC), says that, although Atlas still &quot;strains against the weight of the sky ... Zeus freed the Titans&quot;, and in another poem (476 BC), Pindar has Cronus, in fact, ruling in the Isles of the Blessed, a land where the Greek heroes reside in the afterlife:
&quot;Prometheus Lyomenos&quot;, an undated lost play by Aeschylus (c. 525 – c. 455 BC), had a chorus composed of freed Titans. Possibly even earlier than Pindar and Aeschylus, two papyrus versions of a passage of Hesiods&#x27; &quot;Works and Days&quot; also mention Cronus being released by Zeus, and ruling over the heroes who go to the Isle of the Blessed; but other versions of Hesiod&#x27;s text do not, and most editors judge these lines of text to be later interpolations.

==Near East origins==
It is generally accepted that the Greek succession myth was imported from the Near East, and that along with this imported myth came stories of a group of former ruling gods, who had been defeated and displaced, and who became identified, by the Greeks, as the Titans. Features of Hesiod&#x27;s account of the Titans can be seen in the stories of the Hurrians, the Hittites, the Babylonians, and other Near Eastern cultures.

The Hurro-Hittite text &quot;Song of Kumarbi&quot; (also called &quot;Kingship in Heaven&quot;), written five hundred years before Hesiod, tells of a succession of kings in heaven: Anu (Sky), Kumarbi, and the storm-god Teshub, with many striking parallels to Hesiod&#x27;s account of the Greek succession myth. Like Cronus, Kumarbi castrates the sky-god Anu, and takes over his kingship. And like Cronus, Kumarbi swallows gods (and a stone?), one of whom is the storm-god Teshub, who like the storm-god Zeus, is apparently victorious against Kumarbi and others in a war of the gods.

Other Hittite texts contain allusions to &quot;former gods&quot; (), precisely what Hesiod called the Titans, . Like the Titans, these Hittite , were twelve (usually) in number and end up confined in the underworld by the storm-god Teshub, imprisoned by gates they cannot open. In Hurrian, the Hittite&#x27;s were known as the &quot;gods of down under&quot; () and the Hittites identified these gods with the Anunnaki, the Babylonian gods of the underworld, whose defeat and imprisonment by the storm-god Marduk, in the Babylonian poem &quot;Enûma Eliš&quot; (late second millennium BC or earlier), parallels the defeat and imprisonment of the Titans. Other collectivities of gods, perhaps associated with the Mesopotamian Anunnaki, include the Dead Gods (&quot;Dingiruggû&quot;), the Banished Gods (&quot;ilāni darsūti&quot;), and the Defeated (or Bound) Gods (&quot;ilāni kamûti&quot;).

==Orphic literature==

===The &quot;sparagmos&quot;===

In Orphic literature, the Titans play an important role in what is often considered to be the central myth of Orphism, the &quot;sparagmos&quot;, that is the dismemberment of Dionysus, who in this context is often given the title Zagreus. As pieced together from various ancient sources, the reconstructed story, usually given by modern scholars, goes as follows. Zeus had intercourse with Persephone in the form of a serpent, producing Dionysus. He is taken to Mount Ida where (like the infant Zeus) he is guarded by the dancing Curetes. Zeus intended Dionysus to be his successor as ruler of the cosmos, but a jealous Hera incited the Titans—who apparently unlike in Hesiod and Homer, were not imprisoned in Tartarus—to kill the child. The Titans whiten their faces with gypsum, and distracting the infant Dionysus with various toys, including a mirror, they seized Dionysus and tore (or cut) him to pieces. The pieces were then boiled, roasted and partially eaten, by the Titans. But Athena managed to save Dionysus&#x27; heart, by which Zeus was able to contrive his rebirth from Semele.

===The anthropogony===
Commonly presented as a part of the myth of the dismembered Dionysus Zagreus, is an Orphic anthropogony, that is an Orphic account of the origin of human beings. According to this widely held view, as punishment for their crime, Zeus struck the Titans with his thunderbolt, and from the remains of the destroyed Titans humankind was born, which resulted in a human inheritance of ancestral guilt, for this original sin of the Titans, and by some accounts &quot;formed the basis for an Orphic doctrine of the divinity of man.&quot; However, when and to what extent there existed any Orphic tradition which included these elements is the subject of open debate.

The 2nd century AD biographer and essayist Plutarch makes a connection between the &quot;sparagmos&quot; and the punishment of the Titans, but makes no mention of the anthropogony, or Orpheus, or Orphism. In his essay &quot;On the Eating of Flesh&quot;, Plutarch writes of &quot;stories told about the sufferings and dismemberment of Dionysus and the outrageous assaults of the Titans upon him, and their punishment and blasting by thunderbolt after they had tasted his blood&quot;. While, according to the early 4th century AD Christian apologist Arnobius, and the 5th century AD Greek epic poet Nonnus, it is as punishment for their murder of Dionysus that the Titans end up imprisoned by Zeus in Tartarus.

The only ancient source to explicitly connect the &quot;sparagmos&quot; and the anthropogony is the 6th century AD Neoplatonist Olympiodorus, who writes that, according to Orpheus, after the Titans had dismembered and eaten Dionysus, &quot;Zeus, angered by the deed, blasts them with his thunderbolts, and from the sublimate of the vapors that rise from them comes the matter from which men are created.&quot; Olympiodorus goes on to conclude that, because the Titans had eaten his flesh, we their descendants, are a part of Dionysus.

===Modern interpretations===
Some 19th- and 20th-century scholars, including Jane Ellen Harrison, have argued that an initiatory or shamanic ritual underlies the myth of the dismemberment and cannibalism of Dionysus by the Titans. Martin Litchfield West also asserts this in relation to shamanistic initiatory rites of early Greek religious practices.

==Etymology==
The etymology of &quot;Τiτᾶνες&quot; (&quot;Titanes&quot;) is uncertain. Hesiod in the &quot;Theogony&quot; gives a double etymology, deriving it from [to strain] and [vengeance], saying that Uranus gave them the name Titans: &quot;in reproach, for he said that they strained and did presumptuously a fearful deed, and that vengeance for it would come afterwards&quot;. But modern scholars doubt Hesiod&#x27;s etymology.

Jane Ellen Harrison asserts that the word &quot;Titan&quot; comes from the Greek τίτανος, signifying white &quot;earth, clay, or gypsum&quot;, and that the Titans were &quot;white clay men&quot;, or men covered by white clay or gypsum dust in their rituals.

==In astronomy==
The planet Saturn is named for the Roman equivalent of the Titan Cronus. Saturn&#x27;s largest moon, Titan, is named after the Titans generally, and the other moons of Saturn are named after individual Titans, specifically Tethys, Phoebe, Rhea, Hyperion, and Iapetus. Astronomer William Henry Pickering claimed to have discovered another moon of Saturn which he named Themis, but this discovery was never confirmed, and the name Themis was given to an asteroid, 24 Themis. Asteroid 57 Mnemosyne was also named for the Titan.

A proto-planet Theia is hypothesized to have been involved in a collision in the early solar system, forming the Earth&#x27;s moon.

<text>Titan is the largest moon of Saturn and the second-largest in the Solar System. It is the only moon known to have an atmosphere denser than the Earth&#x27;s and is the only known object in space—other than Earth—on which there is clear evidence that stable bodies of liquid exist. Titan is one of seven gravitationally rounded moons of Saturn and the second-most distant among them. Frequently described as a planet-like moon, Titan is 50% larger in diameter than Earth&#x27;s Moon and 80% more massive. It is the second-largest moon in the Solar System after Jupiter&#x27;s Ganymede and is larger than Mercury; yet Titan is only 40% as massive as Mercury, because Mercury is mainly iron and rock while much of Titan is ice, which is less dense.

Discovered in 1655 by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, Titan was the first known moon of Saturn and the sixth known planetary satellite (after Earth&#x27;s moon and the four Galilean moons of Jupiter). Titan orbits Saturn at 20 Saturn radii or 1,200,000 km above Saturn&#x27;s apparent surface. From Titan&#x27;s surface, Saturn, disregarding its rings, subtends an arc of 5.09 degrees, and if it were visible through the moon&#x27;s thick atmosphere, it would appear 11.4 times larger in the sky, in diameter, than the Moon from Earth, which subtends 0.48° of arc.

Titan is primarily composed of ice and rocky material, with a rocky core surrounded by various layers of ice, including a crust of ice Ih and a subsurface layer of ammonia-rich liquid water. Much as with Venus before the Space Age, the dense opaque atmosphere prevented understanding of Titan&#x27;s surface until the &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; mission in 2004 provided new information, including the discovery of liquid hydrocarbon lakes in Titan&#x27;s polar regions and the discovery of its atmospheric super-rotation. The geologically young surface is generally smooth, with few impact craters, although mountains and several possible cryovolcanoes have been found.

The atmosphere of Titan is mainly nitrogen and methane; minor components lead to the formation of hydrocarbon clouds and heavy organonitrogen haze. Its climate—including wind and rain—creates surface features similar to those of Earth, such as dunes, rivers, lakes, seas (probably of liquid methane and ethane), and deltas, and is dominated by seasonal weather patterns as on Earth. With its liquids (both surface and subsurface) and robust nitrogen atmosphere, Titan&#x27;s methane cycle nearly resembles Earth&#x27;s water cycle, albeit at a much lower temperature of about . Due to these factors, Titan is called the most Earth-like celestial object in the Solar System.

== Discovery and naming ==
The Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens discovered Titan on March 25, 1655. Fascinated by Galileo&#x27;s 1610 discovery of Jupiter&#x27;s four largest moons and his advancements in telescope technology, Huygens, with the help of his elder brother Constantijn Huygens Jr., began building telescopes around 1650 and discovered the first observed moon orbiting Saturn with one of the telescopes they built.

Huygens named his discovery &quot;Saturni Luna&quot; (or &quot;Luna Saturni&quot;, Latin for &quot;moon of Saturn&quot;), publishing in the 1655 tract &quot;De Saturni Luna Observatio Nova&quot; (&quot;A New Observation of Saturn&#x27;s Moon&quot;). After Giovanni Domenico Cassini published his discoveries of four more moons of Saturn between 1673 and 1686, astronomers began referring to these and Titan as Saturn I through V (with Titan then in fourth position). Other early epithets for Titan include &quot;Saturn&#x27;s ordinary satellite.&quot; The International Astronomical Union officially numbers Titan as &quot;Saturn VI.&quot;

The name &quot;Titan&quot;, and the names of all seven satellites of Saturn then known, came from John Herschel (son of William Herschel, discoverer of two other Saturnian moons, Mimas and Enceladus), in his 1847 publication &quot;Results of Astronomical Observations Made during the Years 1834, 5, 6, 7, 8, at the Cape of Good Hope&quot;. Numerous small moons have been discovered around Saturn since then. Saturnian moons are named after mythological giants. The name Titan comes from the Titans, a race of immortals in Greek mythology.
== Formation ==
The regular moons of Jupiter and Saturn likely formed via co-accretion, similar to the process believed to have formed the planets in the Solar System. As the young gas giants formed, they were surrounded by discs of material that gradually coalesced into moons. While the four Galilean moons of Jupiter exist in highly regular, planet-like orbits, Titan overwhelmingly dominates Saturn&#x27;s system and has a high orbital eccentricity not immediately explained by co-accretion alone. A proposed model for the formation of Titan is that Saturn&#x27;s system began with a group of moons similar to Jupiter&#x27;s Galilean moons, but that they were disrupted by a series of giant impacts, which would go on to form Titan. Saturn&#x27;s mid-sized moons, such as Iapetus and Rhea, were formed from the debris of these collisions. Such a violent beginning would also explain Titan&#x27;s orbital eccentricity. A 2014 analysis of Titan&#x27;s atmospheric nitrogen suggested that it was possibly sourced from material similar to that found in the Oort cloud and not from sources present during the co-accretion of materials around Saturn.

== Orbit and rotation ==
Titan orbits Saturn once every 15 days and 22 hours. Like Earth&#x27;s Moon and many of the satellites of the giant planets, its rotational period (its day) is identical to its orbital period; Titan is tidally locked in synchronous rotation with Saturn, and permanently shows one face to the planet. Longitudes on Titan are measured westward, starting from the meridian passing through this point. Its orbital eccentricity is 0.0288, and the orbital plane is inclined 0.348 degrees relative to the Saturnian equator.

The small and irregularly shaped satellite Hyperion is locked in a 3:4 orbital resonance with Titan—that is, Hyperion orbits three times for every four times Titan orbits. Hyperion probably formed in a stable orbital island, whereas the massive Titan absorbed or ejected any other bodies that made close approaches.

== Bulk characteristics ==

Titan is 5,149.46 km (3,199.73 mi) in diameter; it is 6% larger than the planet Mercury and 50% larger than Earth&#x27;s Moon. Titan is the tenth-largest object known in the Solar system, including the Sun. Before the arrival of &quot;Voyager 1&quot; in 1980, Titan was thought to be slightly larger than Ganymede, which has a diameter 5,262 km (3,270 mi), and thus the largest moon in the Solar System. This was an overestimation caused by Titan&#x27;s dense, opaque atmosphere, with a haze layer 100–200 km above its surface. This increases its apparent diameter. Titan&#x27;s diameter and mass (and thus its density) are similar to those of the Jovian moons Ganymede and Callisto. Based on its bulk density of 1.881 g/cm3, Titan&#x27;s composition is 40–60% rock, with the rest being water ice and other materials.

Titan is probably partially differentiated into distinct layers with a 3,400 km (2,100 mi) rocky center. This rocky center is believed to be surrounded by several layers composed of different crystalline forms of ice, and/or water. The exact structure depends heavily on the heat flux from within Titan itself, which is poorly constrained. The interior may still be hot enough for a liquid layer consisting of a &quot;magma&quot; composed of water and ammonia between the ice Ih crust and deeper ice layers made of high-pressure forms of ice. The heat flow from inside Titan may even be too high for high pressure ices to form, with the outermost layers instead consisting primarily of liquid water underneath a surface crust. The presence of ammonia allows water to remain liquid even at a temperature as low as (for eutectic mixture with water). 

The &quot;Cassini&quot; probe discovered evidence for the layered structure in the form of natural extremely-low-frequency radio waves in Titan&#x27;s atmosphere. Titan&#x27;s surface is thought to be a poor reflector of extremely-low-frequency radio waves, so they may instead be reflecting off the liquid–ice boundary of a subsurface ocean. Surface features were observed by the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft to systematically shift by up to 30 km (19 mi) between October 2005 and May 2007, which suggests that the crust is decoupled from the interior, and provides additional evidence for an interior liquid layer. Further supporting evidence for a liquid layer and ice shell decoupled from the solid core comes from the way the gravity field varies as Titan orbits Saturn. Comparison of the gravity field with the RADAR-based topography observations also suggests that the ice shell may be substantially rigid.

== Atmosphere ==
Titan is the only moon in the Solar System with an atmosphere denser than Earth&#x27;s, with a surface pressure of , and it is one of only two moons whose atmospheres are able to support clouds, hazes, and weather—the other being Neptune&#x27;s moon Triton. The presence of a significant atmosphere was first suspected by astronomer Josep Comas i Solà, who observed distinct limb darkening on Titan in 1903. Due to the extensive, hazy atmosphere, Titan was once thought to be the largest moon in the Solar System until the &quot;Voyager&quot; missions revealed that Ganymede is slightly larger. The haze also shrouded Titan&#x27;s surface from view, so direct images of its surface could not be taken until the &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; mission in 2004.

The primary constituents of Titan&#x27;s atmosphere are nitrogen, methane, and hydrogen. The precise atmospheric composition varies depending on altitude and latitude due to methane cycling between a gas and a liquid in Titan&#x27;s lower atmospherethe methane cycle. Nitrogen is the most abundant gas, with a concentration of around 98.6% in the stratosphere that decreases to 95.1% in the troposphere. Direct observations by the &quot;Huygens&quot; probe determined that methane concentrations are highest near the surface, with a concentration of 4.92% that remains relatively constant up to 8 km (5.0 mi) above the surface. Methane concentrations then gradually decrease with increasing altitude, down to a concentration of 1.41% in the stratosphere. Methane also increases in concentration near Titan&#x27;s winter pole, probably due to evaporation from the surface in high-latitude regions. Hydrogen is the third-most abundant gas, with a concentration of around 0.1%. There are trace amounts of other hydrocarbons, such as ethane, diacetylene, methylacetylene, acetylene, and propane, and other gases, such as cyanoacetylene, hydrogen cyanide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, cyanogen, argon, and helium. The hydrocarbons are thought to form in Titan&#x27;s upper atmosphere in reactions resulting from the breakup of methane by the Sun&#x27;s ultraviolet light, producing a thick orange smog.

Energy from the Sun should have converted all traces of methane in Titan&#x27;s atmosphere into more complex hydrocarbons within 50 million years—a short time compared to the age of the Solar System. This suggests that methane must be replenished by a reservoir on or within Titan itself. The ultimate origin of the methane in its atmosphere may be its interior, released via eruptions from cryovolcanoes.
On April 3, 2013, NASA reported that complex organic chemicals, collectively called tholins, likely arise on Titan, based on studies simulating the atmosphere of Titan.

On June 6, 2013, scientists at the IAA-CSIC reported the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the upper atmosphere of Titan.

On September 30, 2013, propene was detected in the atmosphere of Titan by NASA&#x27;s &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft, using its composite infrared spectrometer (CIRS). This is the first time propene has been found on any moon or planet other than Earth and is the first chemical found by the CIRS. The detection of propene fills a mysterious gap in observations that date back to NASA&#x27;s &quot;Voyager 1&quot; spacecraft&#x27;s first close planetary flyby of Titan in 1980, during which it was discovered that many of the gases that make up Titan&#x27;s brown haze were hydrocarbons, theoretically formed via the recombination of radicals created by the Sun&#x27;s ultraviolet photolysis of methane.

== Climate ==
Titan&#x27;s surface temperature is about . At this temperature, water ice has an extremely low vapor pressure, so the little water vapor present appears limited to the stratosphere. Titan receives about 1% as much sunlight as Earth. Before sunlight reaches the surface, about 90% has been absorbed by the thick atmosphere, leaving only 0.1% of the amount of light Earth receives.

Atmospheric methane creates a greenhouse effect on Titan&#x27;s surface, without which Titan would be much colder. Conversely, haze in Titan&#x27;s atmosphere contributes to an anti-greenhouse effect by absorbing sunlight, canceling a portion of the greenhouse effect and making its surface significantly colder than its upper atmosphere.

Titan&#x27;s clouds, probably composed of methane, ethane or other simple organics, are scattered and variable, punctuating the overall haze. The findings of the &quot;Huygens&quot; probe indicate that Titan&#x27;s atmosphere periodically rains liquid methane and other organic compounds onto its surface.

Clouds typically cover 1% of Titan&#x27;s disk, though outburst events have been observed in which the cloud cover rapidly expands to as much as 8%. One hypothesis asserts that the southern clouds are formed when heightened levels of sunlight during the southern summer generate uplift in the atmosphere, resulting in convection. This explanation is complicated by the fact that cloud formation has been observed not only after the southern summer solstice but also during mid-spring. Increased methane humidity at the south pole possibly contributes to the rapid increases in cloud size. It was summer in Titan&#x27;s southern hemisphere until 2010, when Saturn&#x27;s orbit, which governs Titan&#x27;s motion, moved Titan&#x27;s northern hemisphere into the sunlight. When the seasons switch, it is expected that ethane will begin to condense over the south pole.

== Surface features ==

The surface of Titan has been described as &quot;complex, fluid-processed, [and] geologically young&quot;. Titan has been around since the Solar System&#x27;s formation, but its surface is much younger, between 100 million and 1 billion years old. Geological processes may have reshaped Titan&#x27;s surface. Titan&#x27;s atmosphere is four times as thick as Earth&#x27;s, making it difficult for astronomical instruments to image its surface in the visible light spectrum. The &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft used infrared instruments, radar altimetry and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging to map portions of Titan during its close fly-bys. The first images revealed a diverse geology, with both rough and smooth areas. There are features that may be volcanic in origin, disgorging water mixed with ammonia onto the surface. There is also evidence that Titan&#x27;s ice shell may be substantially rigid, which would suggest little geologic activity.

There are also streaky features, some of them hundreds of kilometers in length, that appear to be caused by windblown particles. Examination has also shown the surface to be relatively smooth; the few features that seem to be impact craters appeared to have been partially filled in, perhaps by raining hydrocarbons or cryovolcanism. Radar altimetry suggests topographical variation is low, typically no more than 150 meters. Occasional elevation changes of 500 meters have been discovered and Titan has mountains that sometimes reach several hundred meters to more than one kilometer in height.

Titan&#x27;s surface is marked by broad regions of bright and dark terrain. These include Xanadu, a large, reflective equatorial area about the size of Australia. It was first identified in infrared images from the Hubble Space Telescope in 1994, and later viewed by the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft. The convoluted region is filled with hills and cut by valleys and chasms. It is criss-crossed in places by dark lineaments—sinuous topographical features resembling ridges or crevices. These may represent tectonic activity, which would indicate that Xanadu is geologically young. Alternatively, the lineaments may be liquid-formed channels, suggesting old terrain that has been cut through by stream systems. There are dark areas of similar size elsewhere on Titan, observed from the ground and by &quot;Cassini&quot;; at least one of these, Ligeia Mare, Titan&#x27;s second-largest sea, is almost a pure methane sea.

=== Lakes and seas ===
Following the &quot;Voyager&quot; flybys, Titan was confirmed to have an atmosphere capable of supporting liquid hydrocarbons on its surface. However, the first tentative detection only came in 1995, when data from the Hubble Space Telescope and radar observations suggested expansive hydrocarbon lakes, seas, or oceans. The existence of liquid hydrocarbons on Titan was finally confirmed in situ by the &quot;Cassini&quot; orbiter, with the &quot;Cassini&quot; mission team announcing &quot;definitive evidence of the presence of lakes filled with liquid methane on Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan&quot; in January 2007.

The observed lakes and seas of Titan are largely restricted to its polar regions, where colder temperatures allow the presence of permanent liquid hydrocarbons. Near Titan&#x27;s north pole are Kraken Mare, the largest sea; Ligeia Mare, the second-largest sea; and Punga Mare, each filling broad depressions and cumulatively representing roughly 80% of Titan&#x27;s sea and lake coverage— 691,000 km² (267,000 sq mi) combined. All three maria&#x27;s sea levels are similar, suggesting that they may be hydraulically connected. The southern polar region, meanwhile, hosts four dry broad depressions, potentially representing dried-up seabeds. Additional smaller lakes occupy Titan&#x27;s polar regions, covering a cumulative surface area of 215,000 km² (83,000 sq mi). Lakes in Titan&#x27;s lower-latitude and equatorial regions have been proposed, though none have been confirmed; seasonal or transient equatorial lakes may pool following large rainstorms. &quot;Cassini&quot; RADAR data has been used to conduct bathymetry of Titan&#x27;s seas and lakes. Using detected subsurface reflections, the measured maximum depth of Ligeia Mare is roughly , and that of Ontario Lacus is roughly .

Titan&#x27;s lakes and seas are dominated by methane (), with smaller amounts of ethane () and dissolved nitrogen (). The fraction of these components varies across different bodies: observations of Ligeia Mare are consistent with 71% , 12% , and 17% by volume; whilst Ontario Lacus is consistent with 49% , 41% , and 10% by volume. As Titan is synchronously locked with Saturn, there exists a permanent tidal bulge of roughly at the sub- and anti-Saturnian points. Titan&#x27;s orbital eccentricity means that tidal acceleration varies by 9%, though the long orbital period means that these tidal cycles are very gradual. A team of researchers led by Ralph D. Lorenz evaluated that the tidal range of Titan&#x27;s major seas are around .

=== Tectonics and cryovolcanism ===
Through &quot;Cassini&quot; RADAR mapping of Titan&#x27;s surface, numerous landforms have been interpreted as candidate cryovolcanic and tectonic features by multiple authors. A 2016 analysis of mountainous ridges on Titan revealed that ridges are concentrated in Titan&#x27;s equatorial regions, implying that ridges either form more frequently in or are better preserved in low-latitude regions. The ridges—primarily oriented east to west—are linear to arcuate in shape, with the authors of the analysis comparing them to terrestrial fold belts indicative of horizontal compression or convergence. They note that the global distribution of Titan&#x27;s ridges could be indicative of global contraction, with a thickened ice shell causing regional uplift.

The identification of cryovolcanic features on Titan remains controversial and inconclusive, primarily due to limitations of &quot;Cassini&quot; imagery and coverage. &quot;Cassini&quot; RADAR and VIMS imagery revealed several candidate cryovolcanic features, particularly flow-like terrains in western Xanadu and steep-sided lakes in the northern hemisphere that resemble maar craters on Earth, which are created by explosive subterranean eruptions. The likeliest cryovolcano features is a complex of landforms that includes two mountains, Doom Mons and Erebor Mons; a large depression, Sotra Patera; and a system of flow-like features, Mohini Fluctus. Between 2005 and 2006, parts of Sotra Patera and Mohini Fluctus became significantly brighter whilst the surrounding plains remained unchanged, potentially indicative of ongoing cryovolcanic activity. Indirect lines of evidence for cryovolcanism include the presence of Argon-40 in Titan&#x27;s atmosphere. Radiogenic 40Ar is sourced from the decay of 40K, and has likely been produced within Titan over the course of billions of years within its rocky core. 40Ar&#x27;s presence in Titan&#x27;s atmosphere is thus supportive of active geology on Titan, with cryovolcanism being one possible method of bringing the isotope up from the interior.

=== Impact craters ===
Titan&#x27;s surface has comparatively few impact craters, with erosion, tectonics, and cryovolcanism possibly working to erase them over time. Compared to the craters of similarly sized and structured Ganymede and Callisto, those of Titan are much shallower. Many have dark floors of sediment; geomorphological analysis of impact craters largely suggests that erosion and burial are the primary mechanisms of crater modification. Titan&#x27;s craters are also not evenly distributed, as the polar regions are almost devoid of any identified craters whilst the majority are located in the equatorial dune fields. This inequality may be the result of oceans that once occupied Titan&#x27;s poles, polar sediment deposition by past rainfall, or increased rates of erosion in the polar regions.

=== Plains and dunes ===

The majority of Titan&#x27;s surface is covered by plains. Of the several types of plains observed, the most extensive are the Undifferentiated Plains that encompass vast, radar-dark uniform regions.
These mid-latitude plains—located largely between 20 and 60° north or south—appear younger than all major geological features except dunes and several craters. The Undifferentiated Plains likely were formed by wind-driven processes and composed of organic-rich sediment.

Another extensive type of terrain on Titan are sand dunes, grouped together into vast dune fields or &quot;sand seas&quot; located within 30° north or south. Titanian dunes are typically 1–2 km (0.62–1.24 mi) wide and spaced 1–4 km (0.62–2.49 mi) apart, with some individual dunes over 100 km (62 mi) in length. Limited radar-derived height data suggests that the dunes are tall, with the dunes appearing dark in &quot;Cassini&quot; SAR imagery. Interactions between the dunes and obstacle features, such as mountains, indicate that sand is generally transported in a west-to-east direction. The sand that constructs the dunes is dominated by organic material, probably from Titan&#x27;s atmosphere; possible sources of sand include river channels or the Undifferentiated Plains.

== Observation and exploration ==
Titan is never visible to the naked eye, but can be observed through small telescopes or strong binoculars. Amateur observation is difficult because of the proximity of Titan to Saturn&#x27;s brilliant globe and ring system; an occulting bar, covering part of the eyepiece and used to block the bright planet, greatly improves viewing. Titan has a maximum apparent magnitude of +8.2, and mean opposition magnitude 8.4. This compares to +4.6 for the similarly sized Ganymede, in the Jovian system.

Observations of Titan prior to the space age were limited. In 1907 astronomer Josep Comas i Solà observed limb darkening of Titan, the first evidence that the body has an atmosphere. In 1944 Gerard P. Kuiper used a spectroscopic technique to detect an atmosphere of methane.

=== &quot;Pioneer&quot; and &quot;Voyager&quot; ===

The first probe to visit the Saturnian system was &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; in 1979, which revealed that Titan was probably too cold to support life. It took images of Titan, including Titan and Saturn together in mid to late 1979. The quality was soon surpassed by the two &quot;Voyagers&quot;.

Titan was examined by both &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; in 1980 and 1981, respectively. &quot;Voyager 1&quot;&#x27;s trajectory was designed to provide an optimized Titan flyby, during which the spacecraft was able to determine the density, composition, and temperature of the atmosphere, and obtain a precise measurement of Titan&#x27;s mass. Atmospheric haze prevented direct imaging of the surface, though in 2004 intensive digital processing of images taken through &quot;Voyager 1&quot;&#x27;s orange filter did reveal hints of the light and dark features now known as Xanadu and Shangri-la, which had been observed in the infrared by the Hubble Space Telescope. &quot;Voyager 2&quot;, which would have been diverted to perform the Titan flyby if &quot;Voyager 1&quot; had been unable to, did not pass near Titan and continued on to Uranus and Neptune.

=== &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; ===
The &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; spacecraft reached Saturn on July 1, 2004, and began the process of mapping Titan&#x27;s surface by radar. A joint project of the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA, &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; proved a very successful mission. The &quot;Cassini&quot; probe flew by Titan on October 26, 2004, and took the highest-resolution images ever of Titan&#x27;s surface, at only 1,200 km (750 mi), discerning patches of light and dark that would be invisible to the human eye.

On July 22, 2006, &quot;Cassini&quot; made its first targeted, close fly-by at 950 km (590 mi) from Titan; the closest flyby was at 880 km (550 mi) on June 21, 2010. Liquid has been found in abundance on the surface in the north polar region, in the form of many lakes and seas discovered by &quot;Cassini&quot;.

==== &quot;Huygens&quot; landing ====

&quot;Huygens&quot; was an atmospheric probe that touched down on Titan on January 14, 2005, discovering that many of its surface features seem to have been formed by fluids at some point in the past. Titan is the most distant body from Earth to have a space probe land on its surface.

The &quot;Huygens&quot; probe landed just off the easternmost tip of a bright region now called Adiri. The probe photographed pale hills with dark &quot;rivers&quot; running down to a dark plain. Current understanding is that the hills (also referred to as highlands) are composed mainly of water ice. Dark organic compounds, created in the upper atmosphere by the ultraviolet radiation of the Sun, may rain from Titan&#x27;s atmosphere. They are washed down the hills with the methane rain and are deposited on the plains over geological time scales.

After landing, &quot;Huygens&quot; photographed a dark plain covered in small rocks and pebbles, which are composed of water ice. The two rocks just below the middle of the image on the right are smaller than they may appear: the left-hand one is 15 centimeters across, and the one in the center is 4 centimeters across, at a distance of about 85 centimeters from &quot;Huygens&quot;. There is evidence of erosion at the base of the rocks, indicating possible fluvial activity. The ground surface is darker than originally expected, consisting of a mixture of water and hydrocarbon ice.

In March 2007, NASA, ESA, and COSPAR decided to name the &quot;Huygens&quot; landing site the &quot;Hubert Curien Memorial Station&quot; in memory of the former president of the ESA.

=== &quot;Dragonfly&quot; ===
The &quot;Dragonfly&quot; mission, developed and operated by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, is scheduled to launch in July 2028. It consists of a large drone powered by an RTG to fly in the atmosphere of Titan as New Frontiers 4. Its instruments will study how far prebiotic chemistry may have progressed. The mission is planned to arrive at Titan in the mid-2030s.

=== Proposed or conceptual missions ===
There have been several conceptual missions proposed in recent years for returning a robotic space probe to Titan. Initial conceptual work has been completed for such missions by NASA (and JPL), and ESA. At present, none of these proposals have become funded missions. The Titan Saturn System Mission (TSSM) was a joint NASA/ESA proposal for exploration of Saturn&#x27;s moons. It envisions a hot-air balloon floating in Titan&#x27;s atmosphere for six months. It was competing against the Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) proposal for funding. In February 2009 it was announced that ESA/NASA had given the EJSM mission priority ahead of the TSSM. The proposed Titan Mare Explorer (TiME) was a low-cost lander that would splash down in Ligeia Mare in Titan&#x27;s northern hemisphere. The probe would float whilst investigating Titan&#x27;s hydrocarbon cycle, sea chemistry, and Titan&#x27;s origins. It was selected for a Phase-A design study in 2011 as a candidate mission for the 12th NASA Discovery Program opportunity, but was not selected for flight.

Another mission to Titan proposed in early 2012 by Jason Barnes, a scientist at the University of Idaho, is the Aerial Vehicle for In-situ and Airborne Titan Reconnaissance (AVIATR): an uncrewed plane (or drone) that would fly through Titan&#x27;s atmosphere and take high-definition images of the surface of Titan. NASA did not approve the requested $715 million, and the future of the project is uncertain.

A conceptual design for another lake lander was proposed in late 2012 by the Spanish-based private engineering firm SENER and the Centro de Astrobiología in Madrid. The concept probe is called Titan Lake In-situ Sampling Propelled Explorer (TALISE). The major difference compared to the TiME probe would be that TALISE is envisioned with its own propulsion system and would therefore not be limited to simply drifting on the lake when it splashes down.

A Discovery Program contestant for its mission #13 is Journey to Enceladus and Titan (JET), an astrobiology Saturn orbiter that would assess the habitability potential of Enceladus and Titan.

In 2015, the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts program (NIAC) awarded a Phase II grant to a design study of a Titan Submarine to explore the seas of Titan.

== Prebiotic conditions and life ==

Titan is thought to be a prebiotic environment rich in complex organic compounds, but its surface is in a deep freeze at so it is currently understood that life cannot exist on the moon&#x27;s frigid surface. However, Titan seems to contain a global ocean beneath its ice shell, and within this ocean, conditions are potentially suitable for microbial life.

The &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; mission was not equipped to provide evidence for biosignatures or complex organic compounds; it showed an environment on Titan that is similar, in some ways, to ones hypothesized for the primordial Earth. Scientists surmise that the atmosphere of early Earth was similar in composition to the current atmosphere on Titan, with the important exception of a lack of water vapor on Titan.

=== Formation of complex molecules ===
The Miller–Urey experiment and several following experiments have shown that with an atmosphere similar to that of Titan and the addition of UV radiation, complex molecules and polymer substances like tholins can be generated. The reaction starts with dissociation of nitrogen and methane, forming hydrogen cyanide and acetylene. Further reactions have been studied extensively.

It has been reported that when energy was applied to a combination of gases like those in Titan&#x27;s atmosphere, five nucleotide bases, the building blocks of DNA and RNA, were among the many compounds produced. In addition, amino acids—the building blocks of protein—were found. It was the first time nucleotide bases and amino acids had been found in such an experiment without liquid water being present.

=== Possible subsurface habitats ===
Laboratory simulations have led to the suggestion that enough organic material exists on Titan to start a chemical evolution analogous to what is thought to have started life on Earth. The analogy assumes the presence of liquid water for longer periods than is currently observable; several hypotheses postulate that liquid water from an impact could be preserved under a frozen isolation layer. It has also been hypothesized that liquid-ammonia oceans could exist deep below the surface. Another model suggests an ammonia–water solution as much as 200 km (120) deep beneath a water-ice crust with conditions that, although extreme by terrestrial standards, are such that life could survive. Heat transfer between the interior and upper layers would be critical in sustaining any subsurface oceanic life. Detection of microbial life on Titan would depend on its biogenic effects, with the atmospheric methane and nitrogen examined.

=== Methane and life at the surface ===
It has been speculated that life could exist in the lakes of liquid methane on Titan, just as organisms on Earth live in water. Such organisms would inhale H2 in place of O2, metabolize it with acetylene instead of glucose, and exhale methane instead of carbon dioxide. However, such hypothetical organisms would be required to metabolize at a deep freeze temperature of .

All life forms on Earth (including methanogens) use liquid water as a solvent; it is speculated that life on Titan might instead use a liquid hydrocarbon, such as methane or ethane, although water is a stronger solvent than methane. Water is also more chemically reactive, and can break down large organic molecules through hydrolysis. A life form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the risk of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way.

In 2005, astrobiologist Chris McKay argued that if methanogenic life did exist on the surface of Titan, it would likely have a measurable effect on the mixing ratio in the Titan troposphere: levels of hydrogen and acetylene would be measurably lower than otherwise expected. Assuming metabolic rates similar to those of methanogenic organisms on Earth, the concentration of molecular hydrogen would drop by a factor of 1000 on the Titanian surface solely due to a hypothetical biological sink. McKay noted that, if life is indeed present, the low temperatures on Titan would result in very slow metabolic processes, which could conceivably be hastened by the use of catalysts similar to enzymes. He also noted that the low solubility of organic compounds in methane presents a more significant challenge to any possible form of life. Forms of active transport, and organisms with large surface-to-volume ratios could theoretically lessen the disadvantages posed by this fact.

In 2010, Darrell Strobel, from Johns Hopkins University, identified a greater abundance of molecular hydrogen in the upper atmospheric layers of Titan compared to the lower layers, arguing for a downward flow at a rate of roughly 1028 molecules per second and disappearance of hydrogen near Titan&#x27;s surface; as Strobel noted, his findings were in line with the effects McKay had predicted if methanogenic life-forms were present. The same year, another study showed low levels of acetylene on Titan&#x27;s surface, which were interpreted by McKay as consistent with the hypothesis of organisms consuming hydrocarbons. Although restating the biological hypothesis, he cautioned that other explanations for the hydrogen and acetylene findings are more likely: the possibilities of yet unidentified physical or chemical processes (e.g. a surface catalyst accepting hydrocarbons or hydrogen), or flaws in the current models of material flow. Composition data and transport models need to be substantiated, etc. Even so, despite saying that a non-biological catalytic explanation would be less startling than a biological one, McKay noted that the discovery of a catalyst effective at would still be significant. With regards to the acetylene findings, Mark Allen, the principal investigator with the NASA Astrobiology Institute Titan team, provided a speculative, non-biological explanation: sunlight or cosmic rays could transform the acetylene in icy aerosols in the atmosphere into more complex molecules that would fall to the ground with no acetylene signature.

As NASA notes in its news article on the June 2010 findings: &quot;To date, methane-based life forms are only hypothetical. Scientists have not yet detected this form of life anywhere.&quot; As the NASA statement also says: &quot;some scientists believe these chemical signatures bolster the argument for a primitive, exotic form of life or precursor to life on Titan&#x27;s surface.&quot;

In February 2015, a hypothetical cell membrane capable of functioning in liquid methane at cryogenic temperatures (deep freeze) conditions was modeled. Composed of small molecules containing carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, it would have the same stability and flexibility as cell membranes on Earth, which are composed of phospholipids, compounds of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus. This hypothetical cell membrane was termed an &quot;azotosome&quot;, a combination of &quot;azote&quot;, French for nitrogen, and &quot;liposome&quot;.

=== Obstacles ===
Despite these biological possibilities, there are formidable obstacles to life on Titan, and any analogy to Earth is inexact. At a vast distance from the Sun, Titan is frigid, and its atmosphere lacks CO2. At Titan&#x27;s surface, water exists only in solid form. Because of these difficulties, scientists such as Jonathan Lunine have viewed Titan less as a likely habitat for life than as an experiment for examining hypotheses on the conditions that prevailed prior to the appearance of life on Earth. Although life itself may not exist, the prebiotic conditions on Titan and the associated organic chemistry remain of great interest in understanding the early history of the terrestrial biosphere. Using Titan as a prebiotic experiment involves not only observation through spacecraft, but laboratory experiments, and chemical and photochemical modeling on Earth.

=== Panspermia hypothesis ===
It is hypothesized that large asteroid and cometary impacts on Earth&#x27;s surface may have caused fragments of microbe-laden rock to escape Earth&#x27;s gravity, suggesting the possibility of panspermia. Calculations indicate that these would encounter many of the bodies in the Solar System, including Titan. On the other hand, Jonathan Lunine has argued that any living things in Titan&#x27;s cryogenic hydrocarbon lakes would need to be so different chemically from Earth life that it would not be possible for one to be the ancestor of the other.

=== Future conditions ===
Conditions on Titan could become far more habitable in the far future. Five billion years from now, as the Sun becomes a sub-red giant, its surface temperature could rise enough for Titan to support liquid water on its surface, making it habitable. As the Sun&#x27;s ultraviolet output decreases, the haze in Titan&#x27;s upper atmosphere will be depleted, lessening the anti-greenhouse effect on the surface and enabling the greenhouse created by atmospheric methane to play a far greater role. These conditions together could create a habitable environment, and could persist for several hundred million years. This is proposed to have been sufficient time for simple life to spawn on Earth, though the higher viscosity of ammonia-water solutions coupled with low temperatures would cause chemical reactions to proceed more slowly on Titan.
