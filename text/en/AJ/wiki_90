<text>Oswald Theodore Avery Jr. (October 21, 1877 – February 20, 1955) was a Canadian-American physician and medical researcher. The major part of his career was spent at the Rockefeller Hospital in New York City. Avery was one of the first molecular biologists and a pioneer in immunochemistry, but he is best known for the experiment (published in 1944 with his co-workers Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty) that isolated DNA as the material of which genes and chromosomes are made.

The Nobel laureate Arne Tiselius said that Avery was the most deserving scientist not to receive the Nobel Prize for his work, though he was nominated for the award throughout the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s.

The lunar crater Avery was named in his honor.

== Family ==
Oswald Avery&#x27;s grandfather was Joseph Henry Avery. He was a papermaker, and he was in charge of the papermaking at Oxford University. He discovered a way to make thin paper that could be printed on both sides. This paper was used to make Oxford Bibles.

Avery&#x27;s father, Joseph Francis Avery, born in 1846 in Norwich, Norfolk, became a Baptist minister after coming under the influence of C. H. Spurgeon, a Baptist Evangelist. He married his wife, Elizabeth Crowdy, in 1870, and spent three years in England, where he would continue his pastoral service as a Baptist. After this, he would move to Halifax, Nova Scotia with his wife, against the wishes of his friends, believing it to be the Will of God. He remained as a pastor for 14 years in Halifax before traveling to the Mariner&#x27;s Temple in New York City, where he would preach to a rowdy and poverty-stricken crowd. While here, he would publish an edifying pamphlet entitled &quot;The Voyage of Life&quot;, edited the church publication Buds and Blossoms, and patented and attempted to sell a preparation known as &quot;Avery&#x27;s Auraline&quot;, though it would gain little success. When their home burned to the ground in December 1890, the Baptist community of New York banded together to help pay for the expenses, including one John D. Rockefeller. He would die in 1892, leaving his wife Elizabeth Avery a widow.

Avery&#x27;s mother, Elizabeth Crowdy, was the beating heart and soul that made her husband&#x27;s church the community center it was. After Joseph Francis Avery&#x27;s death, she would continue editing the publication Buds and Blossoms. She would also continue to work with the Baptist City Mission Society, where she would come into association with a number of wealthy people, including the Sloans, the Vanderbilts, and the Rockefellers.

Oswald had two siblings - an older brother Ernest and a younger brother Roy. Ernest was a gifted child, but became ill at a young age. Roy followed his brother Oswald in the field of bacteriology. He eventually taught at Vanderbilt Medical School in Nashville, Tennessee.

==Early life and education==
Oswald Avery was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1877 to Francis Joseph Avery, a Baptist minister, and his wife Elizabeth Crowdy. The couple had immigrated from Britain in 1873. Oswald Avery was born and grew up in a small wooden row house on Moran Street in the North End of Halifax, now a designated heritage building. When Avery was 10, his family moved to the Lower East Side of New York City. Oswald Avery began participating in church activities at a young age. He and his older brother Ernest learned how to play the cornet from a German musician who played at church. Soon, both were playing at church themselves. The brothers played on the steps of Mariners&#x27; Temple to attract worshippers. Both earned a scholarship to the National Conservatory of Music. Ernest became sick and did not continue, but Oswald pushed onward. He became talented enough to play with the National Academy of Music in Antonin Dvorak&#x27;s Symphony No. 5, From the New World, under direction of Walter Damrosch.

Oswald Avery began at Colgate University in 1896. Even though Colgate was a Baptist school, there were signs of rebellion against orthodoxy during Avery&#x27;s time at the university. In Avery&#x27;s senior year, he and a few of his classmates asked their philosophy professor to create a metaphysics class that would allow them to explore the credibility of the Christian faith. Avery&#x27;s senior year was entirely electives, but he did not choose to take a single science elective, even though many were offered. Avery made exceptional grades throughout his years at Colgate. He received 8.5 out of 10 or above in all courses his freshman year and 9 out of 10 or above his sophomore through senior year. Avery&#x27;s top grades were in his public speaking courses, in which he never received lower than a 9.5. He even tied for first with his friend Emerson in an oratorical contest. Avery earned his undergraduate degree in humanities at Colgate University and was a member of the Class of 1900.

Oswald Avery began medical studies at The College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University in New York later in the year of 1900. At the college, he made good grades in all of his courses, except bacteriology and pathology. He graduated with a medical degree in 1904, and then he began to practice general medicine.&quot;&#x27;&quot; Avery did not like dealing with patients who have chronic diseases that he was unable to fix. He practiced medicine until 1907 when he began working as an associate director to Benjamin White in Hoagland Laboratory.

== Hoagland Laboratory ==
At Hoagland Laboratory, he began by studying the bacteriology of yogurt and other fermented milk products and their effects on gut bacteria. He recorded his findings in &quot;Observations on Certain Lactic Acid Bacteria of the Bulgaricus Type&quot;. During the years 1909 through 1913, he performed medical research with bacteriological, immunological, and chemical approaches.

For a period of time, White came down with tuberculosis. Avery went with him to Trudea Sanatorium for a cure. Afterwards, Avery went back to take vacations at the sanatorium. He became interested in tuberculosis and began doing research in the Trudea Laboratory, where he looked at the clinical and experimental aspects of tuberculosis. Here he carried out 100 consecutive blood cultures of tuberculosis patients in the active phase of the disease. He never found evidence of secondary infection. His careful clinical investigation caught the eye of Dr. Rufus Cole at Rockefeller Institute.

At Hoagland, Avery performed a chemical and toxicological study of a product derived from tubercle bacilli. With White as a colleague, he extracted the product with alkaline ethanol. The research was published in 1912. This further showed his systematic effort to observe and analyze bacterial activity using their chemical structure. In 1911, Avery instructed staff of H. K. Mulford Company in bacteriological techniques, and they taught him the industrial methods for production of antitoxins and vaccines.

Throughout his time at Hoagland, Avery published nine papers, one of which was a chapter on &quot;Opsonins and Vaccine Therapy&quot;. He collaborated with Dr. N. B. Potter for this chapter, which was put in Hare&#x27;s Modern Treatment - a popular medical magazine at the time. Avery also taught a course to student nurses at Hoagland. During the course, he conveyed the dangers of pathogens spread through sneezing. During his teaching, he was given the nicknames &quot;The Professor&quot; and &quot;Fess&quot;. While working at Hoagland, Avery was mailed two written offers from Rockefeller Institute, and he denied them both. Avery did not accept the offer until Rufus Cole from Rockefeller came to offer the position to him in person.

==Rockefeller Institute==
Oswald Avery entered Rockefeller Institute as Assistant in 1913, and in 1915, he became an Associate. In 1919, Avery was promoted to an associate member. He was granted full membership in 1923. At the institute, Cole, Avery and Alphonse Dochez developed the first effective immune serum against a strain of pneumococcus, a bacterium causing pneumonia. The serum was produced from the blood of infected horses.

Research showed that various pneumonia cultures isolated from different patients had different immunological properties. This made it difficult to develop a serum effective against all of the different strains. Four main groups of pneumococcus had been discovered - type I, type II, type III, and type IV. Avery investigated distribution of different pneumococcus types in healthy individuals versus individuals with symptoms of pneumonia. Avery found different subgroups of type II pneumococcus. These groups were similar to the type strain in certain aspects. However, the subgroups of type II had similarities amongst each other that they did not share with the other main groups of pneumococcus. Avery wrote about the results of his findings in a 1915 paper called &quot;Varieties of Pneumococcus and Their Relation to Lobar Pneumonia&quot;. In the paper, he argued that people who appeared to be healthy could be carriers of pneumonia Avery also suggested it was important to identify the type of strain, based on agglutination of the pneumococci, when determining the appropriate serum for the patient. Avery suggested pneumococci strains that produced more severe symptoms had higher virulence than strains that cause less severe symptoms. A serum effective against type II pneumonia was developed. Avery tested the serum in horses. He processed the serum and measured its antipneumococcal activity. Avery concentrated the serum so that a minimal amount of foreign protein was needed in it. Avery wrote the monograph, Acute Lobar Pneumonia: Prevention and Serum Treatment, that was published by The Institute explaining this improvement.

Avery also helped Dochez in his research on specific soluble substances found in the blood and urine of pneumonia patients. The presence of specific soluble substances in a urine sample allowed him to rapidly test the type of pneumonia without having to wait for a culture to grow. Avery and Heidelberger realized that the capsules of different strains of pneumonia had different polysaccharide structures and concluded that polysaccharides play a role in immunological specificity. Their work with specific soluble substances showed that it is important to consider the factor in the chemical composition of organisms to design anti-serums. Avery published papers on specific soluble substance findings between 1923 and 1929, along with an additional paper he published with Goebel in 1933. He worked with Goebel until 1934, and then Gobel continued their work upon his cessation. Later, Avery concluded that a protein determines the specificity of Diplococcus pneumoniae after he observed that the active protein was the same for all pneumococcal strains but different than that of other bacteria.

Avery became an emeritus member of The Institute when he retired in 1943. However, he continued to work in the lab until 1948.

==Debate over the pathogen in the 1918 influenza epidemic==
At the height of the 1918 influenza epidemic, the dominant hypothesis was that the causative agent in the disease was a bacterium — specifically, &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; (then called &#x27;Pfeiffer&#x27;s bacillus&#x27; or &quot;Bacillus influenzae&quot;), 
a microbe first isolated by German bacteriologist Richard Pfeiffer, which he had identified in nasal samples of patients infected by seasonal influenza decades earlier and which was also found in many but not all samples taken from patients in the 1918 epidemic. The failure to isolate &quot;B. influenzae&quot; in some patients was generally attributed to the difficulty of culturing the bacterium.

Peter Olitsky and Frederick Gates at the Rockefeller Institute found that nasal secretions from infected patients could still cause disease in the lungs of rabbits after having been filtered through a bacterium-excluding Berkefeld filter, but other researchers were unable to reproduce their results. Avery initially doubted Olitsky&#x27;s and Gates&#x27;s data, and set out to prove the &quot;B. influenzae&quot; hypothesis. For that purpose, he developed improved culture media for &quot;B. influenzae&quot;, which were widely adopted and reduced the possibility of false negatives. However, &quot;B. influenzae&quot; could still not be found in all influenza patients. The true cause of influenza, a virus, would not be discovered until the 1930s.

==DNA as the basis for genes==
After the influenza epidemic, Avery returned to his work on pneumococcus. He identified R and S strains of the bacterium; the latter caused disease and had a polysaccharide capsule, while the former lacked the capsule and was harmless. Griffith&#x27;s experiment of 1928 showed that the ability to produce a capsule could be transferred from S to R strain bacteria, even if the S strain bacteria were killed first.

For many years, genetic information was thought to be contained in cell protein. Continuing the research done by Frederick Griffith, Avery worked with Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty on the mystery of inheritance. He had received emeritus status from the Rockefeller Institute in 1943, but continued working for five years, though by that time he was in his late sixties. In 1944 at the Rockefeller Institute&#x27;s Hospital for medical research, Oswald Avery, along with Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty, isolated S-strain bacteria and killed them with heat. They used available techniques to remove various macromolecules - proteins, RNA, and DNA - from the bacteria. Then, the killed S-strain bacteria, with various substances removed, were placed with live R-strain bacteria. Avery hypothesized that if the live R-strain bacteria did not transform into S-strain bacteria, then the missing substance contained genetic information and was the &quot;transforming principle&quot;. Proteins were removed with protease enzymes and upon transfer of S-strain bacteria into R-strain, the R-strain transformed into S-strain. Therefore, proteins were not the &quot;transforming principle&quot;. Next, the S-strain bacteria were treated with ribonucleases to degrade their RNA, and the remainder of the S-strain was placed with the live R-strain bacteria. The R-strain still transformed into S-strain, suggesting that RNA was not the transforming substance. Finally, the S-strain bacteria were treated with a deoxyribonuclease enzymes, which removed the DNA, and the S-strain bacteria were placed with the live R-strain bacteria. After this treatment, the R-strain bacteria did not transform into S-strain bacteria. The lack of transformation suggested that DNA was the substance that transformed R-strain into S-strain bacteria and indicated that it was the carrier of genetic information in cells.

Avery&#x27;s conclusion, that &quot;The evidence presented supports the belief that a nucleic acid of the desoxyribose type is the fundamental unit of the transforming principle of Pneumococcus Type III&quot; greatly influenced Erwin Chargaff, who upon reading those words dedicated his work to identify a &quot;chemistry of heredity&quot; which he later elucidated in Chargaff&#x27;s rules. Chargaff would later comment that &quot;As this transformation represents a permanently inheritable alteration of a cell, the chemical nature of the substance responsible for this alteration had been elucidated for the first time. Seldom has more been said in so few words.&quot;

Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase furthered Avery&#x27;s research in 1952 with the Hershey–Chase experiment. These experiments paved the way for Watson and Crick&#x27;s discovery of the helical structure of DNA, and thus the birth of modern genetics and molecular biology. Of this event, Avery wrote in a letter to his youngest brother Roy, a bacteriologist at the Vanderbilt School of Medicine: &quot;It&#x27;s lots of fun to blow bubbles but it&#x27;s wiser to prick them yourself before someone else tries to.&quot;

Nobel laureate Joshua Lederberg stated that Avery and his laboratory provided &quot;the historical platform of modern DNA research&quot; and &quot;betokened the molecular revolution in genetics and biomedical science generally&quot;.

== Retirement and later years ==
While working at Rockefeller Institute, Avery contracted Grave&#x27;s disease, which caused him to experienced mood swings of depression and irritability. After undergoing a thyroidectomy, Avery once again became more lively and began sailing, where he fell in love with the sport. Shortly after, he retired in Nashville, Tennessee, where he lived close to his brother and his brother&#x27;s family, where he was regarded not as a scientist, but as a pleasant family man and a kind country gentleman. While in the southern United States, Avery took a particular interest in the local flora and would act as a gardener would, learning about and appreciating the flowers and trees.

Avery&#x27;s enthusiasm toward researching nucleic acids continued into his retirement, and he would continue his work with Dr. Hugh Morgan, chairman of the department of medicine at Vanderbilt Medical School. Dr. Morgan was given a research grant from the Department of Defense to study immunity to streptococcal infection, and he convinced Avery to help him in his research. Avery worked on this research with Dr. Bertram E. Sprofkin. The two wrote a joint report on &quot;Studies on the bacteriolytic property of &quot;Streptomyces albus&quot; and its action on hemolytic streptococci&quot;.

During his later years, Avery became terminally ill with extensive hepatoma, or liver cancer. He died at age 77 on February 20, 1955, and was buried in Mount Olivet cemetery in Nashville.

<doc id="50849" wikidata="Q93113" url="?curid=50849" title="Coluccio Salutati">
<text>Coluccio Salutati (16 February 1331 – 4 May 1406) was an Italian Renaissance humanist and notary, and one of the most important political and cultural leaders of Renaissance Florence; as chancellor of the Florentine Republic and its most prominent voice, he was effectively the permanent secretary of state in the generation before the rise of the powerful Medici family.

==Early career==
Salutati was born in Stignano, a tiny commune near Buggiano (today&#x27;s province of Pistoia, Tuscany). After studies in Bologna, where his father lived in exile after a Ghibelline coup in Buggiano, the family returned to Buggiano, which had become more securely part of the Republic of Florence. There he worked as notary and pursued his literary studies, coming into contact with the Florentine humanists Boccaccio and Francesco Nelli. The refined and masterful classical Latin of his letters to Florentine scholars earned him the admiring nickname of &quot;Ape of Cicero&quot;, In 1367 Coluccio was appointed chancellor of Todi in the Papal States. Papal secretary Francesco Bruni took Salutati with him to Rome from 1368 to 1370, as assistant in the Papal curia of Pope Urban V recently returned from Avignon. In 1370, through his connections in the curia he was made chancellor of the powerful Tuscan city of Lucca, a post he quickly lost in internecine struggles there.

==Chancellor of Florence==

In 1374 Coluccio received an appointment in Florence and the following year was appointed Chancellor of Florence, the most important position in the bureaucracy of the Florentine Republic. In his position, Salutati was responsible for the widely circulated official correspondences with other states, drafting confidential instructions to ambassadors, conducting diplomacy and negotiating treaties: &quot;in its chancellor Florence had someone truly exceptional, endowed not only with legal knowledge, political cunning and diplomatic skill, but also with psychological penetration, a gift for public relations, and unusual literary skill.&quot; His abilities as a statesman were soon tested as Florence was immediately faced with war with the papacy. Salutati was charged with addressing Pope Gregory XI to assure him that Florence was still a loyal member of the Guelf party. Although he failed to prevent war with the papacy, Salutati soon became the most celebrated chancellor in all of Italy and a master of the formal letter. Florence&#x27;s principal nemesis during his tenure, Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Duke of Milan, once remarked that one of Salutati&#x27;s letters could &quot;cause more damage than a thousand Florentine horsemen.&quot; During his life, Florence warred twice against its powerful northern rival, Giangaleazzo Visconti. His treatise &quot;De tyranno&quot; (&quot;On the tyrant&quot;) published in 1400, has, most likely, its model in Visconti, although in it Salutati (despite being a republican) remains a supporter of the providential universal monarch already put forward by Dante. Occasionally his letters had unintended consequences. When he wrote to the people of Ancona in 1376, inciting them, in the name of their freedom, to revolt against the governor imposed by the pope, he called to mind the evils Italy had suffered on behalf of the French. Word of his nasty tone got to the King of France, which prompted a most conciliatory letter from Salutati, assuring the King that he meant no harm and that Florence would always be a friend to France.

In testimony to his service as chancellor the city of Florence paid 250 florins for his funeral in 1406.

==Cultural achievements==

Coluccio&#x27;s cultural achievements are perhaps even greater than his political ones. A skilled writer and orator, Coluccio drew heavily upon the classical tradition and developed a powerful prose style based on the Latin of Virgil and Cicero: &quot;I have always believed,&quot; Salutati wrote, &quot;I must imitate antiquity not simply to reproduce it, but in order to produce something new&quot;. In this sense his own view of humanism was broader-based than the antiquarianism of the generation of humanists he fostered.

An admiring correspondent of Petrarch, he spent much of his salary on amassing a collection of 800 books, slightly less than his contemporary Niccolò de&#x27; Niccoli. He also pursued classical manuscripts, making a number of important discoveries, the most important being Cicero&#x27;s lost &quot;Letters to his Friends&quot; (&quot;Epistulae ad Familiares&quot;), which showed Cicero as a defender of republican liberty. Coluccio also did important studies of history, tying Florence&#x27;s origin not to the Roman Empire but to the Roman Republic.

He promoted the work of younger humanists such as Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini, Niccolò de&#x27; Niccoli, Leonardo Bruni and Pier Paolo Vergerio.

He also brought the Byzantine scholar Manuel Chrysoloras to Florence in 1397 to teach one of the first courses in Greek since the end of the Roman Empire. After Boethius, few Westerners spoke or read Greek. Many ancient Greek works of science and philosophy were not available in Latin translation. By Salutati&#x27;s time, a few Latin texts of Aristotle had arrived in Europe via Muslim Spain and Sicily. These texts, however, had been translated from Arabic, rather than directly from the Greek. By bringing Chrysoloras to Florence, Salutati made it possible for a select group of scholars (including Bruni and Vergerio) to read Aristotle and Plato in the original ancient Greek.

<doc id="50850" wikidata="Q357539" url="?curid=50850" title="Gian Galeazzo Visconti">
<text>Gian Galeazzo Visconti (16 October 1351 – 3 September 1402), was the first duke of Milan (1395) and ruled that late-medieval city just before the dawn of the Renaissance. He also ruled Lombardy jointly with his uncle Bernabò. He was the founding patron of the Certosa di Pavia, completing the Visconti Castle at Pavia begun by his father and furthering work on the Duomo of Milan. He captured a large territory of northern Italy and the Po valley. He threatened war with France in relation to the transfer of Genoa to French control as well as issues with his beloved daughter Valentina. When he died of fever in the Castello of Melegnano, his children fought with each other and fragmented the territories that he had ruled.

==Biography==
During his patronage of the Visconti Castle, he contributed to the growth of the collection of scientific treatises and richly illuminated manuscripts in the Visconti Library.

Gian Galeazzo was the son of Galeazzo II Visconti and Bianca of Savoy. His father possessed the signoria of the city of Pavia. In 1385 Gian Galeazzo gained control of Milan by overthrowing his uncle Bernabò through treacherous means by faking a religious conversion and ambushing him during a religious procession in Milan. He imprisoned his uncle who soon died, supposedly poisoned on his orders.

Galeazzo&#x27;s role as a statesman also took other forms. Soon after seizing Milan, he took Verona, Vicenza, and Padua, establishing himself as &quot;Signore&quot; of each, and soon controlled almost the entire valley of the Po, including Piacenza where in 1393 he gave the feudal power to Confalonieri family on the lands they already had in the valleys around Piacenza. He lost Padua in 1390 when it reverted to Francesco Novello da Carrara. He received the title of Duke of Milan from Wenceslaus, King of the Romans in 1395 for 100,000 florins.

Gian Galeazzo spent 300,000 golden florins in attempting to turn from their courses the rivers Mincio from Mantua and the Brenta from Padua, in order to render those cities helpless before the force of his arms.

Notable are his library, housed in the grandest princely dwelling in Italy, the Castello in Pavia, and his rich collection of manuscripts, many of them the fruits of his conquests. In 1400, Gian Galeazzo appointed a host of clerks and departments entrusted with improving public health. For the new system of administration and bookkeeping this established, he is credited with creating the first modern bureaucracy, with the assistance of his Chancellor Francesco Barbavara.

=== Conflict with France ===
Galeazzo was a devoted father to his daughter Valentina. He reacted to gossip about Valentina at the French Court by threatening to declare war on France. The wife of King Charles VI of France was Isabeau of Bavaria, the granddaughter of Bernabò Visconti, and, thus, a bitter rival of Valentina and her father Gian Galeazzo.

Furious at French political manoeuvring that had removed Genoa from his influence, Gian Galeazzo had been attempting to stop the transfer of Genoese sovereignty to France and Enguerrand VII was dispatched to warn him that France would consider further interference a hostile act. The quarrel was more than political. Valentina Visconti, the wife of the Duke of Orleans and Gian Galeazzo&#x27;s beloved daughter, had been exiled from Paris due to the machinations of Queen Isabeau the same month as the departure of the crusade.

In 1396, after the disaster of Nicopolis, Galeazzo was strongly suspected of having informed the Ottomans of the Crusaders&#x27; plans and of the size and strength of their army as vengeance for his daughter being accused of being behind the illness of King Charles VI of France, and for France&#x27;s increasing control over the city of Genoa that he had attempted to hamper, for which he had been rebuked by Enguerrand VII before the battle.

=== Uniting Italy and death ===

Gian Galeazzo had dreams of uniting all of northern Italy into one kingdom, a revived Lombard empire. Obstacles included Bologna and especially Florence, who joined with other local potentates in the League of Bologna. In 1402, Gian Galeazzo launched assaults upon these cities. The warfare was extremely costly on both sides, but it was universally believed the Milanese would emerge victorious. The Florentine leaders, especially the chancellor Coluccio Salutati worked successfully to rally the people of Florence, but the Florentines were being taxed hard by famine, disease, and poverty. Galeazzo won another victory over the Bolognese at the Battle of Casalecchio on 26–27 June 1402.

Galeazzo&#x27;s dreams were to come to nought, however, as he succumbed to a fever at the Castello of Melegnano on 10 August 1402. He died on 3 September. His empire fragmented as infighting among his successors wrecked Milan, partly through the division of his lands among both legitimate and illegitimate children.

== Marriage and issue ==
His first marriage was to Isabelle of Valois, who brought him the title of comte de Vertus in Champagne, rendered in Italian as &quot;Conte di Virtù&quot;, the title by which he was known in his early career. They had:
*Gian Galeazzo (b. Pavia, 4 March 1366 – d. bef. 1376).
*Azzone (b. Pavia, 1368 – d. Pavia, 4 October 1381).
*Valentina (b. Pavia, 1371 – d. Château de Blois, Loir-et-Cher, 14 December 1408), married on 17 August 1389 to Louis I, Duke of Orléans
*Carlo (b. Pavia, 11 September 1372 – d. Pavia, 1374).

After Galeazzo&#x27;s wife Isabelle died in childbirth in 1372, he married secondly, on 2 October 1380, his cousin Caterina Visconti, daughter of Bernabò; with her he had:
*Gian Maria (7 September 1388 – 16 May 1412)
*Filippo Maria (3 September 1392 – 13 August 1447).

<doc id="50851" wikidata="Q67841" url="?curid=50851" title="Gregory of Tours">
<text>Gregory of Tours (born ; 30 November – 17 November 594 AD) was a Gallo-Roman historian and Bishop of Tours during the Merovingian period and is known as the &quot;father of French history&quot;. He was a prelate in the Merovingian kingdom, encompassing Gaul&#x27;s historic region.

Gregory&#x27;s most notable work is the (&#x27;Ten Books of Histories&#x27;), also known as the (&#x27;History of the Franks&#x27;). is considered a primary source for the study of Merovingian history and chronicles the accounts of the Franks during the period. Gregory is also known for documenting accounts of religious figures, notably that of Martin of Tours. 

==Biography==
Gregory was born in Clermont, in the Auvergne region of central Gaul. He was born into the upper stratum of Gallo-Roman society as the son of Florentius, Senator of Clermont, by his wife Armentaria II, niece of Bishop Nicetius of Lyon and granddaughter of both Florentinus, Senator of Geneva, and Saint Gregory of Langres. Relatives of Gregory held the Bishoprics of Tours, Lyon, and Langres at the time of his birth and he claimed that he was related to 13 of the 18 bishops of Tours who preceded him. Gregory&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Leocadia III, descended from Vettius Epagathus, the illustrious martyr of Lyon.

His father died while Gregory was young and his widowed mother moved to Burgundy, where she had property. Gregory went to live with his paternal uncle St. Gallus, bishop of Clermont, under whom, and his successor St. Avitus, Gregory had his education. Gregory also received the clerical tonsure from Gallus. Having contracted a serious illness, Gregory made a visit of devotion to the tomb of St. Martin at Tours. Upon his recovery, he began to pursue a clerical career and was ordained deacon by Avitus. Upon the death of St. Euphronius, he was chosen as bishop by the clergy and people, who had been charmed with his piety, learning, and humility. Their deputies overtook him at the court of King Sigebert of Austrasia, and being compelled to acquiesce, though much against his will, Gregory was consecrated by Giles, bishop of Rheims, on 22 August 573, at the age of 34.

He spent most of his career at Tours, although he assisted at the council of Paris in 577. The world in which he lived in was on the cusp between the Western culture of late antiquity and the sweeping changes of early-medieval Europe. Gregory lived also on the border between the Frankish culture of the Merovingians to the north and the Gallo-Roman culture of the south of Gaul.
At Tours, Gregory was well placed to hear and meet people of influence in Merovingian culture. Tours was situated on the Loire, five Roman roads radiated from it, and it was on the main route between the Frankish north and Aquitania, with Spain beyond. At Tours, the Frankish influences of the north and the Gallo-Roman influences of the south had their chief contact . As the center for the popular cult of St Martin, Tours was a pilgrimage site, hospital, and a political sanctuary to which important leaders fled during periods of violence and turmoil in Merovingian politics.

Gregory struggled through personal relations with four Frankish kings, Sigebert I, Chilperic I, Guntram, and Childebert II, and he personally knew most of the leading Franks.

==Works==

Gregory wrote in Late Latin, which frequently departed from Classical usage in both syntax and spelling, although with relatively few changes in inflection.

===&quot;History of the Franks&quot;===
====Summary====
Gregory of Tours&#x27; history is densely written, with numerous narratives and characters. It contains Christian tales of miracles, descriptions of omens and natural events, stories of Christian martyrs, dialogues of church debates, discussions of the lives of holy men, nobility, and eccentric peasants, frequent Bible verses and references, and explorations of the complex international relations between numerous tribes and nations including the Lombards, Visigoths, Ostrogoths and Huns, also Gregory&#x27;s biography and interpretation of events.

====Book 1====
Book One begins with a pronouncement by the author that he is a Frankish Catholic clergyman who follows the Nicene Creed and abhors heresy like those of the &quot;wicked&quot; Arian sect among other heresies. The narrative history begins with a brief epitome of the biblical Old Testament and New Testament, and the subsequent spread of the Christian religion into Gaul. Next, Gregory covers the history of Christianity in Gaul and some of the major events in Roman-Gallo relations. It ends with the death of Saint Martin of Tours in 397.

====Book 2 (397–511)====
Book Two covers the beginnings of the Merovingian dynasty, including King Clovis I&#x27;s conversion to Christianity by his wife Clotilde, and ending with his death in 511, after his conquest of large tracts of land in modern-day France.

====Book 3 (511–548)====
Book Three follows the four sons of Clovis who equally divide his realms after his death in 511. These four kings, Theuderic I, Chlothar I, Childebert I, and Chlodomer, quarrel and fight for supremacy over the Frankish realm. Despite their disputes, they occasionally work together against an outside threat, such as their attack of the Burgundians in 523. Eventually, Chlothar becomes the most powerful king in the Frankish realm. After the death of Theuderic I in 534, Book Three ends with the death of his son and successor Theudebert I in 548. Theudebert&#x27;s kingdom is inherited by Theudebald until his own death in 555.

====Book 4 (548–575)====
Book Four continues from when the two remaining sons of Clovis die: Childebert in 558 and Clothar in 561. The last years of Clothar&#x27;s life see the entire realm of the Franks ruled by him. At the time of his demise in 561 (as under Clovis before him), the kingdom is divided equally between four sons of Clothar: Charibert I, Sigebert I, Guntram, and Chilperic I; they quarrel for control of the entire realm. A truce between them is maintained until after the death of Charibert I in 567. Clothar&#x27;s remaining sons fight for the supremacy, with Sigibert showing the strongest military force. Book Four ends with the killing of Sigbert in 575, leaving Chilperic as the dominant king. Gregory of Tours blames Fredegund, the wife of Chilperic, for the assassination. Fredegund, he says, had long held a grudge against Sigibert and his wife Brunhilda.

==== Book 5 (575–581) ====
Book Five begins the part where the author has much personal knowledge about the events in the Frankish kingdom. This book and the ones after are considerably longer and more detailed than the previous, while covering a shorter amount of time. This book also contains Gregory&#x27;s impressions of ecclesiastical issues he witnessed and had some bearing on. It describes a possible debate that Gregory had with a rival Arian church leader. Moreover, Book 5 also introduces Childebert II, the son of recently slain Sigibert and of the still-living Brunhilda. Childebert is taken along with Brunhilda under the protection of Gunthram, brother and sometime rival of Chilperic.

==== Book 6 (581–584) ====
In Book Six, the young Childebert betrays his alliance with his adoptive uncle Gunthram, who had protected Childebert and his mother after his father Sigibert&#x27;s death. Now Childebert forms an alliance with his uncle, Chilperic, who had often been an enemy of Sigibert. In 584, Chilperic is murdered under mysterious circumstances.

==== Book 7 (584) ====
In Book Seven, Fredegund assumes regency for her young son Clothar II. In the future, he will be king of all Franks until his death in 629 – beyond Gregory&#x27;s narrative, which ends in roughly 593. Fredegund and her son are under the protection of Gunthram. She remains in power until her death in 597. Also in this book is the rebellion of Gundovald and its failure. Gundovald claimed to be a lost illegitimate son of dead Chlothar I. Many of the Frankish nobles and the Byzantine emperor Maurice gave some support to this rebellion; however, it is swiftly crushed by Guntram.

==== Book 8 (585) ====
&quot;Many evil things were done at this time&quot;, as Gregory writes in Book Eight. It begins with the travels of Guntram to Paris and Orleans and describes numerous confrontations between the king and some bishops. Meanwhile, Guntram becomes ill and fears for his life. Gregory comments that the king&#x27;s illness is a just punishment since he is planning to send a great number of bishops into exile. Fredegund gives two poisoned daggers to two clerics and sends them away with the order to assassinate Childebert and Brunehild. However, the two clerics are arrested by Childebert, tortured, and executed. Meanwhile, Fredegund is also behind the assassination of bishop Praetextus of Rouen while he is praying in his church. Guntram orders his army to march against Arian-controlled Septimania and Spain without success and blames his army commanders for having allowed atrocities and random destruction.

==== Book 9 (586–587) ====
In Book Nine, the Treaty of Andelot is signed in 587 between Guntram, Brunhilda, and Childebert II. It is a close pact of alliance, wherein Childebert is formally adopted as Guntram&#x27;s heir. Brunhilda also formally allies with Guntram and comes under his protection.

==== Book 10 (587–591) ====
The last book is set around 589. Basina, the daughter of Chilperic I and Clotilda (daughter of Charibert) leads a brief revolt from a nunnery.

The 18 bishops of Tours are named and described. The book ends with a summary of Gregory&#x27;s previous written works.

==== Analysis ====
The is made up of ten books. Books I to IV initially recount the world&#x27;s history from the Creation (as was traditional for such works); but move quickly on to the Christianization of Gaul, the life and times of Saint Martin of Tours, the conversion of the Franks and the conquest of Gaul under Clovis I, and the more detailed history of the Frankish kings down to the death of Sigebert I in 575. At this date, Gregory had been bishop of Tours for two years.

With his fifth book, Gregory embarks (with some relief) on contemporary history, opening: &quot;Here, I am glad to say, begins Book V&quot;. This, the second part of his history, Books V and VI, closes with Chilperic I&#x27;s death in 584. During the years that Chilperic held Tours, relations between him and Gregory were tense. After hearing rumours that the bishop of Tours had slandered his wife, Fredegund, Chilperic had Gregory arrested and tried for treason – a charge which threatened both Gregory&#x27;s bishopric and his life. The most eloquent passage in the is the closing chapter of Book VI, in which Chilperic&#x27;s character is summed up unsympathetically through the use of an invective: Herod and Nero are among the comparisons employed.

The third part, comprising Books VII to X, takes his increasingly personal account to the year 591, and concludes with a plea for further chroniclers to preserve his work in entirety (as indeed would be done). An epilogue was written in 594, the year of Gregory&#x27;s death.

====Problems of interpretation====

Readers of the may find that one royal Frankish house is more generously treated than others. Gregory was also a Catholic bishop, and his writing reveals views typical of someone in his position. His views on perceived dangers of Arianism, still strong among the Visigoths, led him to preface the with a detailed expression of his orthodoxy on the nature of Christ. In addition, his ridiculing of pagans and Jews reflected how his works were used to spread the Christian faith. For example, in book 2, chapters 28–31, he described the pagans as incestuous and weak and then described the process by which newly converted King Clovis led a much better life than that of a pagan and was healed of all the conundrums he experienced as a pagan.

Gregory&#x27;s education was the standard Latin one of Late Antiquity, focusing on Virgil&#x27;s and Martianus Capella&#x27;s , but also other key texts such as Orosius&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles&quot;, which his continues, and Sallust; he referred to all these works in his own. His education, as was typical for the time, did not extend to a broad acquaintance with the pagan classics, but rather progressed to mastery of the Vulgate Bible. It is said that he constantly complained about his use of grammar. He did not understand how to correctly write masculine and feminine phrases, reflecting either a lack of ability or changes in the Latin language. Though he had read Virgil, considered the greatest Latin stylist, he cautioned: &quot;We ought not to relate their lying fables, lest we fall under sentence of eternal death.&quot; By contrast, he seems to have thoroughly studied the lengthy and complex Vulgate Bible, as well as numerous religious works and historical treatises, which he frequently quoted, particularly in the earlier books of the .

The main impression that historians once retained from the focused on Gregory&#x27;s anecdotes about violence; until recently, historians tended to conclude that Merovingian Gaul was a chaotic, brutal place. Recent scholarship have concluded that Gregory&#x27;s underlying purpose was to highlight the vanity of secular life and contrast it with the miracles of the saints. Though Gregory conveys political and other messages through the , and these are studied very closely, historians now generally agree that this contrast itself is the central and ever-present narrative device.

===Hagiographies===

His &quot;Life of the Fathers&quot; comprises twenty hagiographies of the most prominent religious men of the preceding generation, taking in a wide range the spiritual community of early medieval Gaul, including lives of bishops, clerics, monks, abbots, holy men, and hermits. He praised St. Illidius for purity of heart, St. Brachio the abbot for discipline and determination in study of the scriptures, St Patroclus for unwavering faith in the face of weakness, and St. Nicetius bishop of Lyon for justice. It is the life of St. Nicetius of Trier, though, which dominates this book; his great authority and sense of episcopal responsibility which is the focus of Gregory&#x27;s account as his figure, predestined to be great, bestrode the lives of the others. It is told that he felt a weight on his head, but was unable to see what it was when turning around, though upon smelling its sweet scent he realised that it was the weight of episcopal responsibility. He surmounted the others in the glory of his miracles and was chosen by God to have the entire succession of past and future Frankish kings revealed to him.

A further aspect of this work is the appearance of Gregory himself in certain sections, notably in the life of St. Leobardus. This is for two reasons: Firstly, it created a distinct link between the temporal and the spiritual worlds, firmly placing the accounts of the lives in a world which was understandable and recognisable; or, seen from the other angle, confirming the presence of miracles in the temporal world.

In 587, Gregory began writing the &quot;Book of the Glories of the Martyrs&quot; (), which deals &quot;almost exclusively with the miracles wrought in Gaul by the martyrs of the Roman persecutions&quot;. But it also tells the story of one Theodore who made a pilgrimage to India and reported the existence of a large monastery where the body of Thomas the Apostle was first interred and where miracles took place.

===Fighting heresy===

Gregory&#x27;s avowed aim in writing this book was to &quot;fire others with that enthusiasm by which the saints deservedly climbed to heaven&quot;, though this was not his sole purpose, and he most surely did not expect his entire audience to show promise of such piety as to witness the power of God flowing through them in the way that it did for the fathers. More immediate concerns were at the forefront of his mind as he sought to create a further layer of religious commitment, not only to the Church at Rome, but also to local churches and cathedrals throughout Gaul. Along with his other books (notably the &quot;Glory of the Confessors&quot;, the &quot;Glory of the Martyrs&quot;, and the &quot;Life of St. Martin&quot;), meticulous attention is paid to the local as opposed to universal Christian experience. Within these grandiloquent lives are tales and anecdotes which tie miracles, saints, and their relics to a great diversity of local areas, furnishing his audience with greater knowledge of their local shrine, and providing them with evidence of the work of God in their immediate vicinity, thus greatly expanding their connection with and understanding of their faith. Attacks on heresy also appear throughout his hagiographies; Arianism he took to be the common face of heresy across Europe, exposed to great ridicule. Often, the scenes which expose the weaknesses of heresy focused on images of fire and burning, whilst the Catholics were proved right by the protection lavished on them by God, in Gregory&#x27;s view.

This was of great relevance to Gregory himself as he presided over the important see of Tours, where extensive use was made of the cult of St. Martin in establishing the authority of the bishopric with the congregation and in the context of the Frankish church. Gregory&#x27;s hagiography was an essential component of this. However, this should not be seen as a selfish grab for power on behalf of the bishops who emerge so triumphantly from the &quot;Life of the Fathers&quot;, but rather as a bid for hegemony of doctrine and control over the practice of worship, which they believed to be in the best interests of their congregation and the wider church.

===Gregory&#x27;s Creed===
As an example of Gregory&#x27;s zeal in his fight against heresy, the includes a declaration of faith with which Gregory aimed to prove his orthodoxy with respect to the heresies of his time (&quot;so that my reader may have no doubt that I am Catholic for they are&quot;). The confession is in many phrases, each of which refutes a specific Christian heresy. Thus, Gregory&#x27;s creed presents, in the negative, a virtual litany of heresies:

=== Views on wine ===
Gregory&#x27;s writings make ample references to wine and vineyards. He argued in his writings that wine drinking was defensible when consumed with proper gratitude towards God, but that it was problematic when consumed solely for pleasure.

==Legacy==
The &quot;History of the Franks&quot; by Gregory of Tours is an historical record of great importance. It is a central source for early Frankish history, representing the period of transition from late Roman antiquity to early Medieval times in a nascent Europe. It is believed to be the only reliable source of information to describe the emerging military and political power of the Franks in one kingdom.

Gregory has often been compared to Herodotus, and (with his detailed interest in, and accounts of, ecclesiastical history and maneuverings) to a bloodier Anthony Trollope. According to Robert Win&#x27;s analysis:
Gregory&#x27;s Latin was relatively poor in comparison with earlier centuries when writers were educated at secular Roman grammar and rhetoric schools. He was self-aware of this and apologized for his poor Latin in his introduction:


Win further observed:
Gregory&#x27;s hagiographies are also a valuable source of anecdotes and stories which enrich modern understanding of life and belief in Merovingian Gaul. The motivation behind his works was to show readers the importance and strength of Christianity, and this bias should always be remembered. Alongside the most outstanding poet Venantius Fortunatus in his lifetime, Gregory of Tours is the unique historian from the 6th-century Merovingian world; and his extensive literary output is itself a testimony to the preservation of learning and to the lingering continuity of Gallo-Roman civic culture through the early Middle Ages.

Gregory&#x27;s writings have also provided valuable evidence for music scholars studying Gallican liturgy and Gallican chant. His &quot;Decem Libri Historiarum&quot; is particular has many liturgical references relating to music.

<text>The Holy Roman Emperor, originally and officially the [[Emperor of the Romans]] (; ) during the Middle Ages, and also known as the Roman-German Emperor since the early modern period (; ), was the ruler and head of state of the Holy Roman Empire. The title was held in conjunction with the title of King of Italy (&quot;Rex Italiae&quot;) from the 8th to the 16th century, and, almost without interruption, with the title of King of Germany (&quot;Rex Teutonicorum&quot;, ) throughout the 12th to 18th centuries.

The Holy Roman Emperor title provided the highest prestige among medieval Catholic monarchs, because the empire was considered by the Catholic Church to be the only successor of the Roman Empire during the Middle Ages and the early modern period. Thus, in theory and diplomacy, the emperors were considered first among equalsamong other Catholic monarchs across Europe.

From an autocracy in Carolingian times (AD 800–924), the title by the 13th century evolved into an elective monarchy, with the emperor chosen by the prince-electors. Various royal houses of Europe, at different times, became &quot;de facto&quot; hereditary holders of the title, notably the Ottonians (962–1024) and the Salians (1027–1125). Following the late medieval crisis of government, the Habsburgs kept possession of the title (with only one interruption) from 1440 to 1806. The final emperors were from the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, from 1765 to 1806. The Holy Roman Empire was dissolved by Francis II, after a devastating defeat by Napoleon at the Battle of Austerlitz.

The emperor was widely perceived to rule by divine right, though he often contradicted or rivaled the pope, most notably during the Investiture controversy. The Holy Roman Empire never had an empress regnant, though women such as Theophanu and Maria Theresa exerted strong influence. Throughout its history, the position was viewed as a defender of the Catholic faith. Until Maximilian I in 1508, the Emperor-elect (&quot;Imperator electus&quot;) was required to be crowned by the pope before assuming the imperial title. Charles V was the last to be crowned by the pope in 1530. There were short periods in history when the electoral college was dominated by Protestants, and the electors usually voted in their own political interest. However, even after the Reformation, the elected emperor was always a Catholic.

==Title==

From the time of Constantine I (), the Roman Emperors had, with very few exceptions, taken on a role as promoters and defenders of Christianity. The reign of Constantine established a precedent for the position of the Christian emperor in the Great Church. Emperors considered themselves responsible to God for the spiritual health of their subjects, and after Constantine they had a duty to help the Church define and maintain orthodoxy. The emperor&#x27;s role was to enforce doctrine, root out heresies, and uphold ecclesiastical unity. Both the title and connection between Emperor and Church continued in the Eastern Roman Empire throughout the medieval period (in exile during 1204–1261). The ecumenical councils of the 5th to 8th centuries were convoked by the Eastern Roman Emperors.

In Western Europe, the title of &quot;Emperor in the West&quot; lapsed after the death of Julius Nepos in 480, although the rulers of the barbarian kingdoms continued to recognize the authority of the Eastern Emperor at least nominally well into the 6th century. While the reconquest of Justinian I had re-established Byzantine presence in the Italian Peninsula, religious frictions existed with the Papacy who sought dominance over the Church of Constantinople. Toward the end of the 8th century, the Papacy still recognised the ruler at Constantinople as the Roman Emperor, though Byzantine military support in Italy had increasingly waned, leading to the Papacy to look to the Franks for protection. In 800 Pope Leo III owed a great debt to Charlemagne, the King of the Franks and King of Italy, for securing his life and position. By this time, the Eastern Emperor Constantine VI had been deposed in 797 and replaced as monarch by his mother, Irene.

Under the pretext that a woman could not rule the empire, Pope Leo III declared the throne vacant and crowned Charlemagne Emperor of the Romans (), the successor of Constantine VI as Roman emperor, using the concept of &quot;translatio imperii&quot;. On his coins, the name and title used by Charlemagne is &quot;Karolus Imperator Augustus&quot;. In documents, he used &quot;Imperator Augustus Romanum gubernans Imperium&quot; (&quot;Emperor Augustus, governing the Roman Empire&quot;) and (&quot;most serene Augustus crowned by God, great peaceful emperor governing the empire of the Romans&quot;). The Eastern Empire eventually relented to recognizing Charlemagne and his successors as emperors, but as &quot;Frankish&quot; and &quot;German emperors&quot;, at no point referring to them as Roman, a label they reserved for themselves.

The title of emperor in the West implied recognition by the pope. As the power of the papacy grew during the Middle Ages, popes and emperors came into conflict over church administration. The best-known and most bitter conflict was that known as the investiture controversy, fought during the 11th century between Henry IV and Pope Gregory VII.

After the coronation of Charlemagne, his successors maintained the title until the death of Berengar I of Italy in 924. The comparatively brief interregnum between 924 and the coronation of Otto the Great in 962 is taken as marking the transition from the Frankish Empire to the Holy Roman Empire.
Under the Ottonians, much of the former Carolingian kingdom of Eastern Francia fell within the boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire.

Since 911, the various German princes had elected the &quot;King of the Germans&quot; from among their peers. The King of the Germans would then be crowned as emperor following the precedent set by Charlemagne, during the period of 962–1530. Charles V was the last emperor to be crowned by the pope, and his successor, Ferdinand I, merely adopted the title of &quot;Emperor elect&quot; in 1558. The final Holy Roman emperor-elect, Francis II, abdicated in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars that saw the Empire&#x27;s final dissolution.

The term &quot;sacrum&quot; (i.e., &quot;holy&quot;) in connection with the German Roman Empire was first used in 1157 under Frederick I Barbarossa.

The Holy Roman Emperor&#x27;s standard designation was &quot;August Emperor of the Romans&quot; (&quot;Romanorum Imperator Augustus&quot;). When Charlemagne was crowned in 800, he was styled as &quot;most serene Augustus, crowned by God, great and pacific emperor, governing the Roman Empire,&quot; thus constituting the elements of &quot;Holy&quot; and &quot;Roman&quot; in the imperial title.

The word &quot;Roman&quot; was a reflection of the principle of &quot;translatio imperii&quot; (or in this case &quot;restauratio imperii&quot;) that regarded the Holy Roman emperors as the inheritors of the title of emperor of the Western Roman Empire.

In German-language historiography, the term &quot;Römisch-deutscher Kaiser&quot; (&quot;Roman-German emperor&quot;) is used to distinguish the title from that of Roman emperor on one hand, and that of German emperor (&quot;Deutscher Kaiser&quot;) on the other. The English term &quot;Holy Roman Emperor&quot; is a modern shorthand for &quot;emperor of the Holy Roman Empire&quot; not corresponding to the historical style or title, i.e., the adjective &quot;holy&quot; is not intended as modifying &quot;emperor&quot;; the English term &quot;Holy Roman Emperor&quot; gained currency in the interbellum period (the 1920s to 1930s); formerly the title had also been rendered as &quot;German-Roman emperor&quot; in English.

==Succession==
The elective monarchy of the Kingdom of Germany goes back to the early 10th century, the election of Conrad I of Germany in 911 following the death without issue of Louis the Child, the last Carolingian ruler of Germany. Elections meant the kingship of Germany was only partially hereditary, unlike the kingship of England, although sovereignty frequently remained in a dynasty until there were no more male successors. The process of an election meant that the prime candidate had to make concessions, by which the voters were kept on his side, which was known as &quot;Wahlkapitulationen&quot; (electoral capitulation).

Conrad was elected by the German dukes, and it is not known precisely when the system of seven prince-electors was established. The papal decree &quot;Venerabilem&quot; by Innocent III (1202), addressed to Berthold V, Duke of Zähringen, establishes the election procedure by (unnamed) princes of the realm, reserving for the pope the right to approve of the candidates. A letter of Pope Urban IV (1263), in the context of the disputed vote of 1256 and the subsequent interregnum, suggests that by &quot;immemorial custom&quot;, seven princes had the right to elect the king and future emperor. The seven prince-electors are named in the Golden Bull of 1356: the archbishop of Mainz, the archbishop of Trier, the archbishop of Cologne, the king of Bohemia, the count palatine of the Rhine, the duke of Saxony and the margrave of Brandenburg.

After 1438, the title remained in the House of Habsburg and Habsburg-Lorraine, with the brief exception of Charles VII, who was a Wittelsbach. Maximilian I (emperor 1508–1519) and his successors no longer traveled to Rome to be crowned as emperor by the pope. Maximilian, therefore, named himself elected Roman emperor (&quot;Erwählter Römischer Kaiser&quot;) in 1508 with papal approval. This title was in use by all his uncrowned successors. Of his successors, only Charles V, the immediate one, received a papal coronation.

The elector palatine&#x27;s seat was conferred on the duke of Bavaria in 1621, but in 1648, in the wake of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the elector palatine was restored, as the eighth elector. The Electorate of Hanover was added as a ninth elector in 1692, confirmed by the Imperial Diet in 1708. The whole college was reshuffled in the German mediatization of 1803 with a total of ten electors, a mere three years before the dissolution of the Empire.

==List of emperors==

This list includes all 47 German monarchs crowned from Charlemagne until the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire (800–1806).

Several rulers were crowned king of the Romans (king of Germany) but not emperor, although they styled themselves thus, among whom were: Conrad I and Henry the Fowler in the 10th century, and Conrad IV, Rudolf I, Adolf and Albert I during the &quot;interregnum&quot; of the late 13th century.

Traditional historiography assumes a continuity between the Carolingian Empire and the Holy Roman Empire, while a modern convention takes the coronation of Otto I in 962 as the starting point of the Holy Roman Empire (although the term &quot;Sacrum Imperium Romanum&quot; was not in use before the 13th century).

===Frankish emperors===

On Christmas Day, 800, Charlemagne, King of the Franks, was crowned Emperor of the Romans () by Pope Leo III, in opposition to Empress Irene, who was then ruling the Roman Empire from Constantinople. Charlemagne&#x27;s descendants from the Carolingian Dynasty continued to be crowned Emperor until 899, excepting a brief period when the Imperial crown was awarded to the Widonid Dukes of Spoleto. There is some contention as to whether the Holy Roman Empire dates as far back as Charlemagne, some histories consider the Carolingian Empire to be a distinct polity from the later Holy Roman Empire as established under Otto I in 962.

====800–888: Carolingian dynasty====

====891–898: Widonid dynasty====

====896–899: Carolingian dynasty====
====901–905: Bosonid dynasty====

====915–924: Unruoching dynasty====

===Holy Roman Emperors===
While earlier Frankish and Italian monarchs had been crowned as Roman emperors, the actual Holy Roman Empire is often considered to have begun with the crowning of Otto I, at the time Duke of Saxony and King of Germany. Because the King of Germany was an elected position, being elected King of Germany was functionally a pre-requisite to being crowned Holy Roman Emperor. By the 13th century, the Prince-electors became formalized as a specific body of seven electors, consisting of three bishops and four secular princes. Through the middle 15th century, the electors chose freely from among a number of dynasties. A period of dispute during the second half of the 13th century over the kingship of Germany led to there being no emperor crowned for several decades, though this ended in 1312 with the coronation of Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor. The period of free election ended with the ascension of the Austrian House of Habsburg, as an unbroken line of Habsburgs held the imperial throne until the 18th century. Later a cadet branch known as the House of Habsburg-Lorraine passed it from father to son until the abolition of the Empire in 1806. Notably, from the 16th century, the Habsburgs dispensed with the requirement that emperors be crowned by the pope before exercising their office. Starting with Ferdinand I, all successive emperors forwent the traditional coronation.

====962–1024: Ottonian dynasty====

====1027–1125: Salian dynasty====

====1133–1137: Supplinburg dynasty====
====1155–1197: Staufen dynasty====

====1198–1215: Welf dynasty====

====1220–1250: Staufen dynasty====
The interregnum of the Holy Roman Empire is taken to have lasted from the deposition of Frederick II by Pope Innocent IV in 1245 (or alternatively from Frederick&#x27;s death in 1250 or from the death of Conrad IV in 1254) to the election of Rudolf I of Germany (1273). Rudolf was not crowned emperor, nor were his successors Adolf and Albert. The next emperor was Henry VII, crowned on 29 June 1312 by Pope Clement V.

====1312–1313: House of Luxembourg====


====1314–1347: House of Wittelsbach====

====1346–1437: House of Luxembourg====

====1440–1740: House of Habsburg====

In 1508, Pope Julius II allowed Maximilian I to use the title of Emperor without coronation in Rome, though the title was qualified as &quot;Electus Romanorum Imperator&quot; (&quot;elected Emperor of the Romans&quot;). Maximilian&#x27;s successors each adopted the same titulature, usually on becoming the sole ruler of the Holy Roman Empire. Maximilian&#x27;s predecessor Frederick III was the last to be crowned Emperor by the Pope in Rome, while Maximilian&#x27;s successor Charles V was the last to be crowned by the pope, though in Bologna, in 1530.

====1742–1745: House of Wittelsbach====

====1745–1765: House of Lorraine====

====1765–1806: House of Habsburg-Lorraine====
==Coronation==

The Emperor was crowned in a special ceremony, traditionally performed by the Pope in Rome. Without that coronation, no king, despite exercising all powers, could call himself Emperor. In 1508, Pope Julius II allowed Maximilian I to use the title of Emperor without coronation in Rome, though the title was qualified as &quot;Electus Romanorum Imperator&quot; (&quot;elected Emperor of the Romans&quot;). Maximilian&#x27;s successors adopted the same titulature, usually when they became the sole ruler of the Holy Roman Empire. Maximilian&#x27;s first successor Charles V was the last to be crowned Emperor.

<text>Trivial Pursuit is a board game in which winning is determined by a player&#x27;s ability to answer trivia and popular culture questions. Players move their pieces around a board, the squares they land on determining the subject of a question they are asked from a card (from six categories including &quot;history&quot; and &quot;science and nature&quot;). Each correct answer allows the player&#x27;s turn to continue; a correct answer on one of the six &quot;category headquarters&quot; spaces earns a plastic wedge which is slotted into the answerer&#x27;s playing piece. The object of the game is to collect all six wedges from each &quot;category headquarters&quot; space, and then return to the center &quot;hub&quot; space to answer a question in a category selected by the other players.

Since the game&#x27;s first release in 1981, numerous themed editions have been released. Some question sets have been designed for younger players, and others for a specific time period or as promotional tie-ins (such as &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; movies).

==History==
The game was created on December 15, 1979, in Niagara on the Lake, Ontario, by Canadians Chris Haney, a photo editor for Montreal&#x27;s &quot;The Gazette&quot;, and Scott Abbott, a sports editor for &quot;The Canadian Press&quot;. After finding pieces of their &quot;Scrabble&quot; game missing, they decided to create their own game. With the help of John Haney and Ed Werner, they completed development of the game, which was released in 1981. During the development of the game, some of the early work and question writing was completed by Chris and John Haney in Weymouth Library, Dorset where they were staying with family.

The rights to the game were initially licensed to Selchow and Righter in 1982, then to Parker Brothers (later part of Hasbro) in 1988, after initially being turned down by the Virgin Group; in 2008, Hasbro bought the full rights, for US$80 million.

By 1986, the board game had sold 20 million units, grossing $600 million in sales. , more than 100 million games had been sold in 26 countries and 17 languages. Northern Plastics of Elroy, Wisconsin produced 30,000,000 games between 1983 and 1985. In December 1993, Trivial Pursuit was named to the &quot;Games Hall of Fame&quot; by &quot;Games&quot; magazine. An online version of &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot; was launched in September 2003.

==Gameplay==
The object of the game is to move around the board by correctly answering trivia questions. Questions are split into six categories, with each one having its own color to readily identify itself; in the classic version of &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot;, the Geography category is blue, Entertainment is pink, History is yellow, Art &amp; Literature is originally brown, later purple, Science &amp; Nature is green, and Sports &amp; Leisure is orange. The game includes a board, playing pieces, question cards, a box, small plastic wedges to fit into the playing pieces, and a die.

Playing pieces used in &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot; are round and divided into six sections like wedges of pie. A small plastic wedge, sometimes called a cheese (like cheese triangles), can be placed into each of these sections to mark each player&#x27;s progress.
During the game, players move their playing pieces around a board which is shaped like a wheel with six spokes, rolling a single die to determine how far to move. The board is divided into spaces of different colors, and the center space is a hexagonal &quot;hub.&quot; At the end of each spoke is a &quot;category headquarters&quot; space. After landing on a space, the player is asked a question in the category corresponding to its color. A correct answer allows the player to continue their turn, while a miss passes control to the next player in sequence. Questions must be answered without any outside assistance. Landing on a category headquarters space and answering correctly awards a wedge in that color, if the player does not yet have one; wedges are fitted into the playing pieces as they are earned. The player may move in any available direction and change directions at any category headquarters space or the hub, but may not backtrack.

&quot;Roll Again&quot; spaces allow the player an extra die roll without having to answer a question, while landing on the hub allows a player to answer a question in the category of their choice as long as they do not yet have all six wedges. Any number of playing pieces may occupy a given space at the same time. A variant rule ends a player&#x27;s turn on collecting a wedge, preventing a single knowledgeable player from running the board.

After collecting all six wedges and filling their playing piece, the player must land on the hub by exact count and correctly answer a question in a category chosen by the opponents in order to win the game. If the player misses the question, they must leave the hub on their next turn and return to it for another chance to win.

==Editions==
Over the years, numerous editions of &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot; have been produced, usually specializing in various fields. The original version is known as the &quot;Genus&quot; edition (or &quot;Genus I&quot;). Several different general knowledge editions (such as &quot;Genus II&quot;) have followed. Other editions include Junior Edition (1985), All-Star Sports, Baby Boomers, 1980s, All About the 80s, 1990s, &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, and others. In total, over 100 different editions in different languages have been printed.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot; players complained that the 2006 version of the game was dumbed down in comparison to previous editions, with easier questions and more focus on celebrities and show business.

== Reception ==

The Toy Insider mentioned that it can be &quot;enjoyed by baby boomers, millennials, and everyone in between&quot;, while Board Games Land called it &quot;The timeless classic and the godfather of trivia games&quot;.

In a review for Issue 31 of &quot;Games,&quot; Mike Shenk stated the game&#x27;s questions were &quot;excellent in quantity, scope, and level of difficulty&quot; but warned that &quot;the wait between turns can be uncomfortably long.&quot; &quot;Games&quot; also included &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot; in its Games 100 in 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, and 1986, saying &quot;The game’s winning formula is to offer well-written, entertaining questions in a continuing flow of new categories for players of all ages and interests.&quot;

&quot;Jeux &amp; Stratégie&quot; reviewed &quot;Trivial Pursuit (&quot;as &quot;Remue-méninges&quot;) in Issue 28, generally praising the quality and accessibility of the game&#x27;s questions, but also expressing that they are sometimes subject to doubt.

*&quot;Family Games: The 100 Best&quot;

==Legal action==
===Worth lawsuit===
In October 1984, Fred L. Worth, author of &quot;The Trivia Encyclopedia&quot;, &quot;Super Trivia&quot;, and &quot;Super Trivia II&quot;, filed a $300 million lawsuit against the distributors of &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot;. He claimed that more than a quarter of the questions in the game&#x27;s Genus Edition had been taken from his books, even to the point of reproducing typographical errors and deliberately placed misinformation. One of the questions in &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot; was &quot;What was Columbo&#x27;s first name?&quot; with the answer &quot;Philip&quot;. That information had been fabricated to catch anyone who might try to violate his copyright.

The inventors of &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot; acknowledged that Worth&#x27;s books were among their sources, but argued that this was not improper and that facts are not protected by copyright. The district court judge agreed, ruling in favor of the &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot; inventors. The decision was appealed, and in September 1987 the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the ruling. Worth asked the Supreme Court of the United States to review the case, but the Court declined, denying certiorari in March 1988.

===Wall lawsuit===
In 1994, David Wall of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, launched a lawsuit against the game&#x27;s creators. He claimed that in the fall of 1979, he and a friend were hitchhiking near Sydney, Nova Scotia, when they were picked up by Chris Haney. Wall claimed that he told Haney about his idea for the game in detail, including the shape of the markers.

Wall&#x27;s mother testified she found drawings of his that looked like plans for a &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot;-like game, but the drawings had since been destroyed. Wall&#x27;s friend, who was allegedly hitchhiking with him that day, never testified. Haney said he never met Wall.

Over the years, there was much legal wrangling, notably around whether the suit should be decided by a judge or jury. On June 25, 2007, the Nova Scotia Supreme Court ruled against Wall.

==Adaptations==

===Television===

A version of &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot;, hosted by Wink Martindale, aired on The Family Channel in the United States from 1993 to 1994 (Jay Wolpert had attempted a pilot in 1987, but it was not picked up). A syndicated version entitled &quot;Trivial Pursuit: America Plays&quot; aired from 2008 to 2009 and hosted by Christopher Knight. In September 2004, Roger Lodge hosted a sports trivia game show on ESPN entitled &quot;ESPN Trivial Pursuit&quot;, which aired five episodes. A new version of the game premiered on October 3, 2024 on The CW hosted by LeVar Burton.

BBC Television produced a &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot; game show based on the game in the UK hosted by Rory McGrath. Another British version (with rules/format similar to the Wink Martindale version, and also using the same theme tune as the Wink Martindale version) was hosted on The Family Channel (now Challenge) by Tony Slattery. 

In 1991, was aired a local version in Austria, hosted by Bernadette Schneider on ORF.

In Germany, Birgit Lechtermann hosted a local version for VOX from 1993 to 1994.

In 1988, a made-for-television movie entitled &quot;Breaking all the Rules: The Creation of Trivial Pursuit&quot; aired. Treated largely as a comedy, the movie featured the music of Jimmy Buffett and portrayed the creators of the game as three beer-loving Canadians. The actors were Gordon Clapp as John Haney, Malcolm Stewart as Chris Haney and Bruce Pirrie as Scott Abbott.

In Spain, a version of the show called &quot;Trivial Pursuit: Spain Plays&quot; premiered in September 2008 on Antena 3 and then in 2011 presented by Silvia Jato on Veo7 with the title &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot;.

The Soviet Union in 1989 bought the rights to produce its own version of the board game, and also started an official championship for family teams, finals of which were broadcast on Soviet Central Television as the game show &quot;Lucky Case&quot; (russian: Счастливый случай). After the agreement ended in 1991, the show changed their rules, dropping &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot; elements, and continued broadcasting until 2000.

===Arcade game===
In 1984, Bally Sente released a &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot; arcade game. Like the board game, several variants were also subsequently released.

===Home computer games===
British software company Domark released a home computer version (billed as &quot;Trivial Pursuit: The Computer Game&quot;) for multiple formats during the 1980s. This version included pictorial and musical questions but was otherwise mostly faithful to the mechanics of the original board game.

Later, Domark released another version called &quot;Trivial Pursuit: A New Beginning&quot;, also across multiple formats. This version featured a plot about the dying Earth and significantly altered gameplay mechanics.

Hasbro Interactive released a &quot;Millennium Edition&quot; in 1999 with three different modes, and different categories:
*&quot;Classic Pursuit&quot;: Played just like the board game. A &quot;QUICKPLAY&quot; option was also available, where, to speed the game up, every question would be a wedge question. Up to six can play. The winner is the first one to earn all six wedges, land back in the center hub by exact count, and then give a correct answer.
*&quot;Party Pursuit&quot;: Up to three can play. The computer randomly spins categories until there are three to choose from. A correct answer by the first player to buzz in earns the wedge; a wrong answer gives the opposition a chance, as well as take away any wedges earned in a category. The first player to earn all six wedges wins the game. After 20 questions, the computer begins selecting categories for the players.
*&quot;Point Pursuit&quot;: Same as &quot;Party Pursuit,&quot; except point scores are kept, and questions range from 250 to 1,000 points. Players can also wager any or all of their scores on one final question. Bonus points are earned for a wedge and for how much or how little time it took to answer a question.

There are also three different ways to answer the questions:
*Multiple choice, where players choose from numbers 1, 2, 3, or 4;
*Spelling accuracy: loose, where imperfect spelling is accepted by the program;
*Spelling accuracy: strict, where spelling must be precise.

This game featured a total of seven voice-overs, one host, and one for each of the six categories: People &amp; Places (blue wedge), Arts &amp; Entertainment (pink wedge), History (yellow wedge), Science &amp; Nature (brown wedge), Sports &amp; Leisure (green wedge), and Wild Card (orange wedge).

===Online games===
In 1999, Sony Online Entertainment licensed &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot; from Hasbro Interactive to release a downloadable online game on The Station@Sony (home to Everquest at the time), where up to three auto-matched players could chat with each other live while they played. A correct answer on any space earned a wedge on the category answered, the wedge spaces gave the player their choice of category, and the first person to earn four wedges was the winner. It was hosted on The Station until 2001.

In 2003, Bolenka Games released an online game of &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot; on the now-defunct website Uproar.com where it features five editions such as: &quot;Genius&quot;, &quot;Silver Screen&quot;, &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;1980s&quot; and &quot;TV&quot;.

===Video games===
Trivial Pursuit was released for a number of home video systems, including Sega CD, Wii, Windows Phone, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3. The board game was also adapted into a mobile game called &quot;Trivia Crack&quot; as well as &quot;Trivial Pursuit Genius Edition&quot; for the Nokia 3650, 6600, N-Gage, and Siemens SX1.

Ubisoft released &quot;Trivial Pursuit: Live!&quot;, on 17 December 2014 for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, on 18 February 2015 for Xbox One and PlayStation 4. It is similar to the &quot;Buzz!&quot; series. On Xbox One and PS4, it is a part from the Hasbro Game Channel, and it was released in physical on the &quot;Hasbro Family Fun Pack&quot; compilation on 25 October 2016. It was ported on 30 October 2018 on Nintendo Switch, for the &quot;Hasbro Game Night&quot; compilation in physical or individually for download. A sequel called &quot;Trivial Pursuit Live! 2&quot;, published by Ubisoft and developed by Snap Finger Click, was released in 2022 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Stadia.

Trivial Pursuit was also adapted into a featured game on the NTN system of video-bar-trivia games. The game ran during the early 2000s.

<text>In sports, racing is a competition of speed, in which competitors try to complete a given task in the shortest amount of time. Typically this involves traversing some distance, but it can be any other task involving speed to reach a specific goal.

A race may be run continuously to finish or may be made up of several segments called heats, stages or legs. A heat is usually run over the same course at different times. A stage is a shorter section of a much longer course or a time trial.

Early records of races are evident on pottery from ancient Greece, which depicted running men vying for first place. A chariot race is described in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;race&quot; comes from a Norse word. This Norse word arrived in France during the invading of Normandy and gave the word &quot;raz&quot; which means &quot;swift water&quot; in Brittany, as in a mill race; it can be found in &quot;Pointe du Raz&quot; (the most western point of France, in Brittany), and &quot;raz-de-marée&quot; (tsunami). The word race to mean a &quot;contest of speed&quot; was first recorded in the 1510s.

A race and its name are often associated with the place of origin, the means of transport and the distance of the race. As a couple of examples, see the Dakar Rally or the Athens Marathon.

==Forms==

Running a distance is the most basic form of racing, but races may also be done by climbing, swimming, walking, or other types of human locomotion. Races may be conducted with animals such as camels, dogs, horses, pigeons, pigs, snails, or turtles. They also may be done in vehicles such as aircraft, bicycles, boats, cars, or motorcycles; or with another means of transport such as skates, skateboards, skis, sleds, snowboards, or wheelchair. In a relay race members of a team take turns in racing parts of a circuit or performing a certain racing form.

Orienteering races add an additional task of using a map and compass to navigate from point to point in diverse and usually unfamiliar terrain.

A race can also involve any other type of goal like eating. A common speed eating challenge is a hot dog eating race, where contestants try to eat more hot dogs than the other racers.

Racing board games and racing video games are also competitions of speed.

Racing can also be done in more humoristic and entertaining ways such as the Sausage Race, the Red Bull Trolley Grand Prix and wok racing. Racing can be entertained from around the world.

== Sprint finishes ==
A sprint finish is a racing tactic used in many forms of racing where a competitor accelerates towards top speed in the final stages of a race. This tactic is mostly associated with long-distance forms of running and cycling, which often feature large groups of competitors racing at a slower pace for much of the race – this slower aerobic racing allows for the subsequent anaerobic activity required for sprinting. The tactic relies upon keeping greater energy reserves than your opponent until the last part of the race in order to be able to reach the finish point first. It is the opposing tactic to keeping a steady optimal pace throughout a race to maximise your energy efficiency (see running economy).

In track and field, distances from 1500 metres upwards often feature sprint finishes. They can also be found in cross country and road running events, even up to the marathon distance. A runner&#x27;s ability to sprint at the end of a race is also known as their finishing kick. Multisport races, such as the triathlon, often have running as the final section and sprint finish tactics are applied as they are in running-only events.

In cycling, sprint finishes are an integral part of the sport and are used in both track cycling and road cycling. Cycling sprints are often highly tactical, particularly on the track, with cyclists occasionally coming to a near halt at points before reaching a high speed finish. The longer track races such as scratch races often feature sprint finishes, as maintaining a steady pace within the peloton allows opponents to conserve energy through drafting. Road races are similar in this respect, in both short criterium races and long-distance races. Sprint tactics also form a major part of points classifications in road events, where cycling sprinters specialise in reaching an intermediate point first, thus gaining extra points and resulting prizes.

Sprint finish tactics are also used in speedskating, cross-country skiing, long-distance swimming, horse racing and other animal racing sports. The finishes of races which are outright sprinting events in themselves, such as the 100 metres track race, are not normally referred to as sprint finishes, as all competitors are already sprinting by default (thus it is not a racing tactic).

<text>The Tlingit or Lingít ( ) are Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast of North America and constitute two of the 231 ( federally recognized Tribes of Alaska. Most Tlingit are Alaska Natives; however, some are First Nations in Canada.

Their language is the Tlingit language (, pronounced ), Tlingit people today belong to several federally recognized Alaska Native tribes including the Angoon Community Association, Central Council of the Tlingit &amp; Haida Indian Tribes, 
Chilkat Indian Village, Chilkoot Indian Association, Craig Tribal Association, Hoonah Indian Association, Ketchikan Indian Corporation, Klawock Cooperative Association, the Organized Village of Kasaan, the Organized Village of Kake, the Organized Village of Saxman, Petersburg Indian Association, Skagway Village, the Yakutat Tlingit Tribe, and the Wrangell Cooperative Association. Some citizens of the Carcross/Tagish First Nation in Yukon and the Sitka Tribe of Alaska are of Tlingit heritage. Taku Tlingit are enrolled in the Douglas Indian Association in Alaska and the Taku River Tlingit First Nation in Canada.

The Tlingit have a matrilineal kinship system, with children born into the mother&#x27;s clan, and property and hereditary roles passing through the mother&#x27;s line. Their culture and society developed in the temperate rainforest of the southeast Alaskan coast and the Alexander Archipelago. The Tlingit have maintained a complex hunter-gatherer culture based on semi-sedentary management of fisheries. Hereditary slavery was practiced extensively until it was outlawed by the United States Government. The Inland Tlingit live in the far northwestern part of the province of British Columbia and the southern Yukon in Canada.

== Name ==
Their autonym, Łingít, means &quot;People of the Tides&quot;. The Russian name &#x27; (, from a Sugpiaq-Alutiiq term &#x27; for the labret worn by women) or the related German name &quot;&quot; may be encountered referring to the people in older historical literature, such as Grigory Shelikhov&#x27;s 1796 map of Russian America. 

==Territory==

The greatest territory historically occupied by the Tlingit extended from the Portland Canal along the present border between Alaska and British Columbia, north to the coast just southeast of the Copper River delta in Alaska. The Tlingit occupied almost all of the Alexander Archipelago, except the southernmost end of Prince of Wales Island and its surroundings, where the Kaigani Haida moved just before the first encounters with European explorers.

The Coastal Tlingit tribes controlled one of the mountain passes into the Yukon interior; they were divided into three tribes: the Chilkat Tlingit () along the Chilkat River and on Chilkat Peninsula, the Chilkoot Tlingit () and the Taku Tlingit () along the Taku River.

Inland, the Tlingit occupied areas along the major rivers that pierce the Coast Mountains and Saint Elias Mountains and flow into the Pacific, including the Alsek, Tatshenshini, Chilkat, Taku, and Stikine rivers. With regular travel up these rivers, the Tlingit developed extensive trade networks with Athabascan tribes of the interior, and commonly intermarried with them. From this regular travel and trade, a few relatively large populations of Tlingit settled around Atlin, Teslin, and Tagish Lakes, whose headwaters flow from areas near the headwaters of the Taku River.

Delineating the current territory of the Tlingit is complicated because they live in both Canada and the United States, they lack designated reservations, other complex legal and political concerns make the situation confusing, and their population is highly mobile. They also share territory with Athabascan peoples such as the Tahltan, Kaska, and Tagish. In Canada, the Interior Tlingit communities, such as Atlin, British Columbia (Taku River Tlingit), Teslin, Yukon (Teslin Tlingit Council), and Carcross, Yukon (Carcross/Tagish First Nation) have reserves.

Tlingits in Alaska lack Indian reservations because the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) established regional corporations throughout Alaska with complex portfolios of land ownership rather than bounded reservations administered by Tribal Governments. The corporation in the Tlingit region is Sealaska Corporation, which serves the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian in Alaska.

Tlingit people participate in the commercial economy of Alaska, and typically live in privately owned housing and land. Many also possess land allotments from Sealaska or from earlier distributions predating ANCSA. Their current residences are within their historical homelands. Land around Yakutat, south through the Alaskan Panhandle, to the lakes in interior Yukon, as being , the Land of the Tlingit.

The extant Tlingit territory can be roughly divided into four major sections, paralleling ecological, linguistic, and cultural divisions:
* Southern Tlingit, south of Frederick Sound, who live in the northernmost reaches of the Western Red cedar forest.
* Northern Tlingit, north of Frederick Sound to Cape Spencer, Glacier Bay, and Lynn Canal; they occupy the warmest and richest of the Sitka Spruce and Western Hemlock forests. 
* Inland Tlingit along large interior lakes, the Taku River drainage, and southern Yukon, whose share a subsistence lifeway similar to Athabascans in the mixed spruce taiga. 
* Gulf Coast Tlingit, who live along a narrow strip of coastline backed by steep mountains and extensive glaciers north of Cape Spencer and along the coast of the Gulf of Alaska to Controller Bay and Kayak Island. Pacific storms hit their territory.

These categories reflect differences in cultures, food harvesting, and dialects. Tlingit groups trade among themselves with neighboring communities. These academic classifications are supported by similar self-identification among the Tlingit.

===Tribes or ===
==Culture==

The Tlingit culture is multifaceted and complex, a characteristic of Northwest Pacific Coast people with access to easily exploited rich resources. In Tlingit culture a heavy emphasis is placed upon family and kinship, and on a rich oratory tradition. Wealth and economic power are important indicators of rank, but so is generosity and proper behavior, all signs of &quot;good breeding&quot; and ties to aristocracy. Art and spirituality are incorporated in nearly all areas of Tlingit culture, with even everyday objects such as spoons and storage boxes decorated and imbued with spiritual power and historical beliefs of the Tlingits.

Tlingit society is divided into two moieties, the Raven and the Eagle. These in turn are divided into numerous clans, which are subdivided into lineages or house groups. They have a matrilineal kinship system, with descent and inheritance passed through the mother&#x27;s line. These groups have heraldic crests, which are displayed on totem poles, canoes, feast dishes, house posts, weavings, jewelry, and other art forms. The Tlingits pass down &quot;&quot; or blankets that represented trust. Only a Tlingit can inherit one but they can also pass it down to someone they trust, who becomes responsible for caring for it but does not rightfully own it.

Like other Northwest Coast native peoples, the Tlingit did practice hereditary slavery.

==Philosophy and religion==

Tlingit thought and belief, although never formally codified, was historically a fairly well organized philosophical and religious system whose basic axioms shaped the way Tlingit people viewed and interacted with the world around them. Tlingits were traditionally animists, and hunters ritually purified themselves before hunting animals. Shamans, primarily men, cured diseases, influenced weather, aided in hunting, predicted the future, and protected people against witchcraft. A central tenet of the Tlingit belief system is the reincarnation of both humans and animals.

Between 1886 and 1895, in the face of their shamans&#x27; inability to treat Old World diseases including smallpox, many Tlingit people converted to Orthodox Christianity. Russian Orthodox missionaries had translated their liturgy into the Tlingit language. It has been argued that they saw Eastern Orthodox Christianity as a way of resisting assimilation to the &quot;American way of life&quot;, which was associated with Presbyterianism. After the introduction of Christianity, the Tlingit belief system began to erode.

Today, some young Tlingits look back towards their traditional tribal religions and worldview for inspiration, security, and a sense of identity. While many elders converted to Christianity, contemporary Tlingit &quot;reconcile Christianity and the &#x27;traditional culture.&#x27;&quot;

==Language==

The Tlingit people of Southeast Alaska and Western Canada speak the Tlingit language (Lingít ), which is a branch of the Na-Dené language family. Lingít has a complex grammar and sound system and also uses certain phonemes unheard in almost any other language.

Tlingit has an estimated 200 to 400 native speakers in the United States and 100 speakers in Canada. The speakers are bilingual or near-bilingual in English. Tribes, institutions, and linguists are expending extensive effort into revitalization programs in Southeast Alaska to revive and preserve the Tlingit language and its culture. Sealaska Heritage Institute, Goldbelt Heritage Institute and the University of Alaska Southeast have Tlingit language programs, and community classes are held in Klukwan and Angoon.

==Housing==
Tlingit tribes historically built plank houses made from cedar and today call them clanhouses; these houses were built with a foundation such that they could store their belongings under the floors. It is said that these plank houses had no adhesive, nails, or any other sort of fastening devices. Clan houses were usually square or rectangular in shape and had front facing designs and totem poles to represent to which clan and moiety the makers belonged.

== Economy ==
Many Tlingit men work in the fishing industry while women are employed at canneries or in the local handicraft industry. These handicrafts include items like wood carvings and woven baskets which are sold for practical or tourist consumption.

==History==
Various cultures of indigenous people have continuously occupied the Alaska territory for thousands of years, leading to the Tlingit. Human culture with elements related to the Tlingit originated around 10,000 years ago near the mouths of the Skeena and Nass Rivers. The historic Tlingit&#x27;s first contact with Europeans came in 1741 with Russian explorers. Spanish explorers followed in 1775. Tlingits maintained their independence but suffered from epidemics of smallpox and other infectious diseases brought by the Europeans. The 1862 Pacific Northwest smallpox epidemic killed about 60% of the Mainland Tlingit and 37% of the Island Tlingit.

==Food==
Food is a central part of Tlingit culture, and the land is an abundant provider. Most of the richness of intertidal life found on the beaches of Southeast Alaska can be harvested for food. Though eating off the beach could provide a fairly healthy and varied diet, eating nothing but &quot;beach food&quot; is considered contemptible among the Tlingit and a sign of poverty. Indeed, shamans and their families were required to abstain from all food gathered from the beach, and men might avoid eating beach food before battles or strenuous activities in the belief that it would weaken them spiritually and perhaps physically as well. Thus for both spiritual reasons as well as to add some variety to the diet, the Tlingit harvest many other resources for food besides those they easily find outside their front doors. No other food resource receives as much emphasis as salmon; however, seal and game are both close seconds.

Halibut, shellfish, and seaweed traditionally provided food in the spring, while late spring and summer bring seal and salmon. Summer is a time for gathering wild and tame berries, such as salmonberry, soap berry, and currants. In fall, sea otters are hunted. Herring and eulachon are also important staples, that can be eaten fresh or dried and stored for later use. Fish provide meat, oil, and eggs. Sea mammals, such as sea lions and sea otters, are used for food and clothing materials. In the forests near their homes, Tlingit hunted deer, bear, mountain goats and other small mammals.

== Genetics ==
Genetic analyses of HLA I and HLA II genes as well as HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1 gene frequencies links the Ainu people of Japan to some Indigenous peoples of the Americas, especially to populations on the Pacific Northwest Coast such as Tlingit. The scientists suggest that the main ancestor of the Ainu and of the Tlingit can be traced back to Paleolithic groups in Southern Siberia.

<text>Oʻahu (, , sometimes written Oahu) is the third-largest and most populated island of the Hawaiian Islands and of the U.S. state of Hawaii. The state capital, Honolulu, is on Oʻahu&#x27;s southeast coast. The island of Oʻahu and the uninhabited Northwestern Hawaiian Islands constitute the City and County of Honolulu. In 2021, Oʻahu had a population of 995,638, up from 953,207 in 2010 (approximately 70% of the total 1,455,271 population of the Hawaiian Islands, with approximately 81% of those living in or near the Honolulu urban area).

Oʻahu is long and across. Its shoreline is long. Including small associated islands such as Ford Island plus those in Kāneʻohe Bay and off the eastern (windward) coast, its area is , making it the 20th-largest island in the United States.

Well-known features of Oʻahu include Waikīkī, Pearl Harbor, Diamond Head, Hanauma Bay, Kāneʻohe Bay, Kailua Bay, and the North Shore.

==Name==
The Island of Oʻahu in Hawaii is often nicknamed (or translated as) &quot;The Gathering Place&quot;&quot;.&quot; The translation of &quot;gathering place&quot; was suggested as recently as 1922 by &quot;Hawaiian Almanac&quot; author Thomas Thrum. Thrum possibly ignored or misplaced the ʻokina because the Hawaiian phrase &quot;ʻo ahu&quot; could be translated as &quot;gathering of objects&quot; (&quot;ʻo&quot; is a subject marker and &quot;ahu&quot; means &quot;to gather&quot;). The term has no other confirmed meaning in Hawaiian.

== History ==


It is uncertain when Oʻahu was first settled by humans. Early archaeological studies suggested that Polynesian explorers from the Marquesas may have arrived as early as the 3rd century A.D., possibly with a second wave arriving from Tahiti around 1100 A.D. However, more modern analyses indicate that the first settlers probably arrived around 900–1200 A.D.

The first great king of Oʻahu was Maʻilikūkahi, the lawmaker, who initiated a 304-year dynasty of monarchs. Kualiʻi was the first of the warlike kings and was succeeded by his sons. In 1773, the throne fell upon Kahahana, the son of Elani of Ewa. 

On January 19, 1778, Oʻahu was the first of the Hawaiian Islands to be sighted by Captain James Cook during his third voyage of discovery. This was the first recorded encounter of the Hawaiian Islands by non-Polynesian people. Cook bypassed Oʻahu, landing instead at Kauai before continuing his original mission to explore the coast of North America. The next year, on February 27, 1779, Cook&#x27;s second in command, Captain Charles Clerke, became the first recorded non-Polynesian to visit Oʻahu when he landed at Waimea Bay. Earlier that month, Cook had been killed at Kealakekua Bay on the island of Hawaii when a dispute with the local people turned violent. Clerke&#x27;s visit to Oʻahu was brief and the expedition&#x27;s two ships left Waimea Bay the same day after finding it difficult to obtain fresh water.

At the time of Cook&#x27;s visit, the Hawaiian Islands were divided among several warring chiefdoms. In 1783, Kahekili II, king of the island of Maui, conquered Oʻahu. He then made his son, Kalanikūpule, king of Oʻahu turning it into a puppet state. Kalanikūpule was later defeated in the Battle of Nuʻuanu in 1795 by Kamehameha I who then founded the Kingdom of Hawaii. The Hawaiian islands were not fully unified until King Kaumualiʻi surrendered the islands of Kauai and Niihau in 1810.

By the late 18th century, Waikīkī was a major settlement on Oʻahu, serving as Kahekili II&#x27;s residence after 1783. However, as trade with foreigners intensified, the nearby town of Honolulu came to eclipse it in size and importance due to its more accessible harbor.In 1845, Kamehameha III moved his capital to Honolulu from Lahaina on the island of Maui. Later, King Kalākaua had a modern residence built in Honolulu for the royal family – the ʻIolani Palace which still stands as the only royal palace on American soil. In January, 1893, a group of leading American businessmen took up arms near ʻIolani Palace and, along with US Marines from the &quot;USS Boston&quot; that landed in Honolulu harbor, launched a successful &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; against Queen Liliʻuokalani. The insurgents abolished the monarchy and established the Republic of Hawaii, which later successfully lobbied the US government for annexation to the US.

On the morning of December 7, 1941, the Imperial Japanese Navy launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, Oʻahu, bringing the United States into World War II. The attack was aimed at destroying the American will to fight and forcing the US to sue for peace. They attacked the Pacific Fleet of the United States Navy and its defending Army Air Forces and Marine Air Forces. The attack damaged or destroyed 12 American warships, destroyed 188 aircraft, and killed 2,335 American servicemen and 68 civilians (of those, 1,177 were the result of the destruction of the alone).

After World War II, Oʻahu became a tourism and shopping destination with more than five million visitors per year, mainly from the contiguous United States and Japan.

==Geography and climate==
Like all other Hawaiian Islands, Oʻahu was formed from the volcanism associated with the Hawaii hotspot; it started to grow from the sea floor 4 million years ago. Today, the island is composed of the remnants of two extinct and extensively eroded shield volcanoes: the Waiʻanae and Koʻolau Ranges, with a broad valley or saddle between them. The highest point is Kaʻala in the Waiʻanae Range, rising to 4,003 feet (1,220 m) above sea level.

Oʻahu is known for having the longest rain shower in recorded history. Kāneʻohe Ranch reported 247 straight days of rain from August 27, 1993, to April 30, 1994. The average temperature in Oʻahu is around . The island is the warmest from June through October. The winter is cooler, but still warm, with an average temperature of .

== Tourism ==
Oʻahu, along with the rest of the State of Hawaii, relies on tourism as a driving force of the local economy. Popular tourists attractions include beaches such as Ala Moana Beach, Hanauma Bay, Kāneʻohe Bay, Ko Olina Beach Park, Waikīkī Beach, among others. Other tourist attractions include Ala Moana Center, Bishop Museum, the Honolulu Museum of Art, ʻIolani Palace, and Kualoa Ranch.

<text>A stored energy printer is a computer printer that uses the energy stored in a spring or magnetic field to push a hammer through a ribbon to print a dot. As compared to dot matrix printers that print a single column of dots at a time, this printer generally creates an entire line of dots at a time. Therefore, it is also known as a [[line matrix printer]]. This technology produces premium impact printers that print for millions to billions of dots per hammer. The advantage of this technology is that it has the lowest known cost of ownership: ink is transferred by conventional typewriter-style ribbons.

==Technology and use==
The most common printer to use this technology was the line-matrix printer made by Printronix and its licensees. In this type, the hammers are arranged as a &quot;hammerbank&quot;; a type of comb that oscillate horizontally to produce a line of dots.

A character matrix printer has also been produced. In this printer, the hammers are machined from an oval of magnetically permeable stainless steel, and the hammer-tips form vertical rows.

The original technology, patented by Printronix in 1974, has the top of a stiff leaf spring held back by a magnetic pole-piece. A tungsten carbide hammer is brazed to the center-top of the leaf spring. When it produces a dot, a coil (electromagnet) wrapped around the pole-piece neutralizes the magnetic field. The leaf spring snaps the hammer away from the pole-piece, pushing the hammer out against a ribbon and placing an image of a dot onto the paper.

Recent designs have performed complex optimizations in the magnetic circuit, and eliminated unwanted resonances in the spring. The result was a near-doubling of speed. Other improvements include the use of electrical discharge machining to produce complex, three-dimensional hammers that trade-off the magnetic circuit, mechanical resonances, and printing speed.

Normal wear usually occurs when the spring rubs against the pole-piece as it returns. This causes the pole-piece to wear, eventually requiring the pole pieces to be reground and recertified.

Hexavalent chrome plating on the pole-piece, combined with careful design, more than doubles speeds and improves life-span. It produces approximately a billion impressions per hammer.

<text>In biology, an integument is the tissue surrounding an organism&#x27;s body or an organ within, such as skin, a husk, shell, germ or rind.

== Etymology ==
The term is derived from &quot;integumentum&quot;, which is Latin for &quot;a covering&quot;. In a transferred, or figurative sense, it could mean a cloak or a disguise. In English, &quot;integument&quot; is a fairly modern word, its origin having been traced back to the early seventeenth century; and refers to a material or layer with which anything is enclosed, clothed, or covered in the sense of &quot;clad&quot; or &quot;coated&quot;, as with a skin or husk.

== Botanical usage ==
In botany, the term &quot;integument&quot; may be used as it is in zoology, referring to the covering of an organ. When the context indicates nothing to the contrary, the word commonly refers to an envelope covering the nucellus of the ovule. The integument may consist of one layer (unitegmic) or two layers (bitegmic), each of which consisting of two or more layers of cells. The integument is perforated by a pore, the micropyle, through which the pollen tube can enter. It may develop into the testa, or seed coat.

==Zoological usage==
The integument of an organ in zoology typically would comprise membranes of connective tissue such as those around a kidney or liver. In referring to the integument of an animal, the usual sense is its skin and its derivatives: the integumentary system, where &quot;integumentary&quot; is a synonym of &quot;cutaneous&quot;.

In arthropods, the integument, or external &quot;skin&quot;, consists of a single layer of epithelial ectoderm from which arises the cuticle, an outer covering of chitin, the rigidity of which varies as per its chemical composition.

==Derivative terms and sundry usages==
Derivative terms include various adjectival forms such as integumentary (e.g. system), integumental (e.g. integumental glands, &quot;peltate glands, the integument being raised like a bladder due to abundant secretion&quot;) and integumented (as opposed to bare).

Other illustrative examples of usage occur in the following articles:
*Connective tissue in skeletal muscle
*Dorsal artery of the penis (example of integument enclosing an internal organ)
*Flensing
*Flesh (generic use of plural &quot;integuments&quot;)
*Herzog &amp; de Meuron (figurative usage)

<text>The router is a power tool with a flat base and a rotating blade extending past the base. The spindle may be driven by an electric motor or by a pneumatic motor. It routs (hollows out) an area in hard material, such as wood or plastic. Routers are used most often in woodworking, especially cabinetry. They may be handheld or affixed to router tables. Some woodworkers consider the router one of the most versatile power tools.

There is also a traditional hand tool known as a router plane, a form of hand plane with a broad base and a narrow blade projecting well beyond the base plate.

CNC wood routers add the advantages of computer numerical control (CNC).

The laminate trimmer is a smaller, lighter version of the router. Although it is designed for trimming laminates, it can also be used for smaller general routing work.

Rotary tools can also be used similarly to routers with the right bits and accessories (such as plastic router bases).

==History==
Before power routers existed, the router plane was often used for the same purpose.

An incremental step toward modern power routers was the foot-pedal operated router, such as the Barnes Former/Shaper, available in 1877. Barnes patented a reversible rotary cutting head in 1889.
The first portable power router was patented in 1906 by George Kelley and marketed by the Kelley Electric Machine Company. The early electric routers were quite heavy, and only nominally &quot;portable&quot;.

In 1915 Oscar and Rudy Onsrud produced an air-powered router, which they referred to as a Jet Motor Hand Router.

In the 1930s, Stanley Works acquired a line of portable routers from Roy L. Carter, and marketed an 18000 RPM electric hand router similar to modern routers.

Further refinement produced the plunge router, invented by ELU (now part of DeWalt) in Germany around 1949.

Modern routers are often used in place of traditional moulding planes or spindle moulder machines for edge decoration (moulding) of timber.

== Process ==
Routing is a high speed process of cutting, trimming, and shaping wood, metal, plastic, and a variety of other materials.

=== Chip formation ===

Routing and milling are conceptually similar, and end mills can be used in routers, but routing wood is different from milling metal in terms of the mechanics. Chip formation is different, so the optimal tool geometry is different. Routing is properly applied to relatively weak and brittle materials, typically wood. As these materials are weak in small sections, routers can run at extremely high speeds, so even a small router may cut rapidly. Owing to inertia at these high speeds, the normal wood cutting mechanism of Type I chips cannot take place. The cutter edge angle is blunt, approaching 90°, and so a Type III chip forms, with waste material produced as fine dust. This dust is a respiratory hazard, even in benign materials. The forces against the cutter are light, so routers may be hand-held.

When milling metals, the material is relatively ductile, although remaining strong even at a small scale. A Type II chip forms, and waste may be produced as continuous swarf. Cutter forces are high, so milling machines must be robust and rigid, usually substantial constructions of cast iron.

Intermediate materials, such as plastics and sometimes soft aluminium, may be cut by either method, though routing aluminium is usually more of an improvised expedient than a production process, and is noisy and hard on tools.

=== Process characteristics ===

Routing is usually limited to soft metals (aluminium etc.) and rigid non-metals. Specially designed cutters are used for a variety of patterns, cuts, and edging. Both hand controlled and machine controlled/aided routers are common today.

=== Workpiece geometry ===
Routing is a shaping process that produces finished edges and shapes. Some materials that are difficult to shape with other processes, such as fiber-glass, Kevlar, and graphite, can be shaped and finished neatly via various routing techniques. Apart from finished edges and shaping, cutaways, holes, and contours can also be shaped using routers.

== Tools and equipment ==
* The set up includes an air or electric driven router, a cutting tool often referred to as a router bit, and a guide template. Also the router can be fixed to a table or connected to radial arms which can be controlled more easily.
* In general there are three types of cutting bits or tools.
*# Fluted cutters (used for edging and trimming)
*# Profile cutters (used for shaping and trimming)
*# Helical cutters (used on easily machined materials, for drilling, shaping, trimming)
* Safety glasses and ear protection should be worn at all times when using a router.
* Only trained adults, or trained adolescents with supervision, should use the router.

== Moulding ==
The spindle router is positioned at the finer end of the scale of work done by a molding spindle. That is to say it is able to cut grooves, edge molding, and chamfer or radius the edge of a piece of wood. It is also possible to use it for cutting some joints. The shape of cut that is created is determined by the size and shape of the bit (cutter) held in the collet and the depth by the depth adjustment of the sole plate.

== Variety of routers ==
There are a variety of router styles, some are plunge, some are D handled, some are double knob handled. Different manufacturers produce the routers for different wood works, as plunge routers, fixed-base wood routers, combo routers, variable-speed routers, laminate trimmers, CNC wood routers. Nowadays, most better quality routers have variable speed controls and will have plunge bases that can also be locked in place so the router can be used as a fixed-base router. Some have a soft-start feature, meaning they build up speed gradually. This feature is particularly desirable for routers with a large cutter. Holding a 3-horsepower router and turning it on without a soft-start is potentially dangerous, due to the torque of the motor. Holding it with two hands is a must. For routers with a toggle type on/off switch it is important to check to verify the switch is in the off position, prior to plugging it in. For safety, larger router cutters can usually only be used in a router that is mounted in a router table. This makes the tool even more versatile and stable.

The purpose of multiple handle arrangements depends on the bit. Control is easier with different configurations. For example, when shaping the edge of a fine table top, many users prefer a D handle, with variable speed, as it seems to permit better control and burning the wood can be minimized.

Routers have many uses. With the help of the multitude of jigs and various bits, they are capable of producing dovetails, mortises, and tenons, moldings of infinite varieties, dados, rabbets/rebates, raised-panel doors and frames, cutting circles, and so much more.

== Features of the modern spindle router ==

The tool usually consists of a base housing a vertically mounted universal electric motor with a collet on the end of its shaft. The bit is height-adjustable to allow protrusion through an opening in a flat sole plate, usually via adjusting the motor-mounting height (the mechanism of adjustment is widely varied among manufacturers). Control of the router is derived from a handle or knob on each side of the device, or by the more recently developed &quot;D-handle&quot;.

There are two standard types of router—plunge and fixed. When using a plunge-base router, the sole of the base is placed on the face of the work with the cutting bit raised above the work, then the motor is turned on and the cutter is lowered into the work. With a fixed-base router, the cut depth is set before the tool is turned on. The sole plate is then either rested flat on the workpiece overhanging the edge so that the cutting bit is not contacting the work (and then entering the work from the side once the motor is turned on), or the sole plate is placed at an angle with the bit above the work and the bit is &quot;rocked&quot; over into the work once the motor is turned on. In each case, the bit cuts its way in, but the plunge router does it in a more refined way, although the bit used must be shaped so it bores into the wood when lowered.

The baseplate (sole plate) is generally circular (though this, too, varies by individual models) and may be used in conjunction with a fence attached to the base, which then braces the router against the edge of the work, or via a straight-edge clamped across the work to obtain a straight cut. Other means of guiding the machine include the template guide bushing secured in the base around the router cutter, or router cutters with built-in guide bearings. Both of these run against a straight edge or shaped template. Without this, the varying reaction of the wood against the torque of the tool makes it impossible to control with the precision normally required.

== Table mounted router ==

A router may be mounted upside down in a router table or bench. The router&#x27;s base plate is mounted to the underside of the table, with a hole allowing the bit to protrude above the table top. This allows the work to be passed over the router, rather than passing the router over the work. This has benefits when working with smaller objects and makes some router operations safer to execute. A router table may be fitted with a fence, fingerboards and other work-guiding accessories to make the operation safer and more accurate.

A simple router table consists of a rigid top with the router bolted or screwed directly to the underside. More complex solutions can be developed to allow the router to be easily removed from the table as well as facilitate adjusting the router&#x27;s bit height using a &quot;lift&quot; mechanism; there is a wide range of commercially available systems.

In this mode, the router can perform tasks similar to a spindle moulder. For smaller, lighter jobs, the router used in this way can be more convenient than the spindle moulder, with the task of set up being somewhat faster. There is also a much wider range of bit profiles available for the router, although the size is limited.

The router table is usually oriented so that the router bit is vertical and the table over which the work is passed is horizontal. Variations on this include the horizontal router table, in which the table remains horizontal but the router is mounted vertically above the table, so that the router bit cuts from the side. This alternative is for edge operations, such as panel raising and slot cutting.

== Available cutters ==
Router bits come in a large variety of designs to create either decorative effects or joinery aids. Generally, they are classified as either high-speed steel (HSS) or carbide-tipped, however some recent innovations such as solid carbide bits provide even more variety for specialized tasks.

Aside from the materials they are made of, bits can be classified as edge bits or non-edge bits, and whether the bit is designed to be &quot;anti-kickback&quot;. Edge bits have a small wheel bearing to act as a fence against the work in making edge moldings. These bearings can be changed by using commercially available bearing kits. Changing the bearing, in effect, changes the diameter of the cutting edge. This is especially important with rabbeting/rebating bits. Non-edge bits require the use of a fence, either on a router table or attached to the work or router. Anti-kickback bits employ added non-cutting bit material around the circumference of the bit&#x27;s shoulders which serves to limit feed-rate. This reduces the chance that the workpiece is pushed too deeply into the bit (which would result in significant kickback from the cutting edge being unable to compensate).

Bits also differ by the diameter of their shank, with -inch, 12 mm, 10 mm, -inch, 8 mm and -inch and 6 mm shanks (ordered from thickest to thinnest) being the most common. Half-inch bits cost more but, being stiffer, are less prone to vibration (giving smoother cuts) and are less likely to break than the smaller sizes. Care must be taken to ensure the bit shank and router collet sizes match exactly. Failure to do so can cause permanent damage to either or both and can lead to the dangerous situation of the bit coming out of the collet during operation. Many routers come with removable collets for the popular shank sizes (in the US  in and  in, in Great Britain  in, 8 mm and  in, and metric sizes in Europe—although in the United States the  in and 8 mm sizes are often only available for an extra cost).

Many modern routers allow the speed of the bit&#x27;s rotation to be varied. A slower rotation allows bits of larger cutting diameter to be used safely. Typical speeds range from 8,000 to 30,000 rpm.

Router bits can be made to match almost any imaginable profile. Custom router bits can be ordered. They are especially beneficial for home restoration projects, where production of the original trim and molding has been discontinued.

Sometimes complementary bits come in sets designed to facilitate the joinery used in frame and panel construction. One bit is designed to cut the grove in the rail and stile pieces while the other shapes the edge of the panel to fit in the grove.

== CNC router ==
A CNC wood router is a computer controlled machine to which the router or spindle mounts. The CNC Machine can be either a moving gantry style, where the table is fixed and the router spindle moves over it, or fixed bridge design, where the table moves underneath the router spindle, or hand-held style, where the operator moves the machine to the area to be cut and the machine controls the fine adjustments. CAD/CAM software programming is used to model the part that is to be created in the computer and then create a tool path for the machine to follow to cut out the part. The CNC moves along three axes (X-Y-Z). Most CNC routers have a three motor drive system utilizing either servo or stepper motors. More advanced routers use a four motor system for added speed and accuracy.

== Similar tools ==
A tool similar to a router, but designed to hold smaller cutting bits—thereby making it easier to handle for small jobs—is a laminate trimmer.

A related tool, called a &quot;spindle moulder&quot; (UK) or shaper (North America), is used to hold &quot;larger&quot; cutter heads and can be used for deeper or larger-diameter cuts. Another related machine is the pin router, a larger static version of the hand electric router but normally with a much more powerful motor and other features such as automatic template copying.

Some profile cutters use a cutting head reminiscent of a spindle router. These should not be confused with profile cutters used for steel plate which use a flame as the cutting method.

<doc id="50873" wikidata="Q81025" url="?curid=50873" title="Feather">
<text>Feathers are epidermal growths that form a distinctive outer covering, or plumage, on both avian (bird) and some non-avian dinosaurs and other archosaurs. They are the most complex integumentary structures found in vertebrates and an example of a complex evolutionary novelty. They are among the characteristics that distinguish the extant birds from other living groups.

Although feathers cover most of the bird&#x27;s body, they arise only from certain well-defined tracts on the skin. They aid in flight, thermal insulation, and waterproofing. In addition, coloration helps in communication and protection. The study of feathers is called plumology (or plumage science).

People use feathers in many ways that are practical, cultural, and religious. Feathers are both soft and excellent at trapping heat; thus, they are sometimes used in high-class bedding, especially pillows, blankets, and mattresses. They are also used as filling for winter clothing and outdoor bedding, such as quilted coats and sleeping bags. Goose and eider down have great &quot;loft&quot;, the ability to expand from a compressed, stored state to trap large amounts of compartmentalized, insulating air. Feathers of large birds (most often geese) have been and are used to make quill pens. Historically, the hunting of birds for decorative and ornamental feathers has endangered some species and helped to contribute to the extinction of others. Today, feathers used in fashion and in military headdresses and clothes are obtained as a waste product of poultry farming, including chickens, geese, turkeys, pheasants, and ostriches. These feathers are dyed and manipulated to enhance their appearance, as poultry feathers are naturally often dull in appearance compared to the feathers of wild birds.

==Etymology==

Feather derives from the Old English &quot;feþer&quot;, which is of Germanic origin; related to Dutch &quot;veer&quot; and German &quot;Feder&quot;, from an Indo-European root shared by Sanskrit&#x27;s &quot;patra&quot; meaning &#x27;wing&#x27;, Latin&#x27;s &quot;penna&quot; meaning &#x27;feather&#x27;, and Greek&#x27;s &quot;pteron&quot;, &quot;pterux&quot; meaning &#x27;wing&#x27;.

Because of feathers being an integral part of quills, which were early pens used for writing, the word pen itself is derived from the Latin &quot;penna&quot;, meaning feather. The French word &quot;plume&quot; can mean &quot;feather&quot;, &quot;quill&quot;, or &quot;pen&quot;.

==Structures and characteristics==
Feathers are among the most complex integumentary appendages found in vertebrates and are formed in tiny follicles in the epidermis, or outer skin layer, that produce keratin proteins. The β-keratins in feathers, beaks and claws – and the claws, scales and shells of reptiles – are composed of protein strands hydrogen-bonded into β-pleated sheets, which are then further twisted and crosslinked by disulfide bridges into structures even tougher than the α-keratins of mammalian hair, horns and hooves. The exact signals that induce the growth of feathers on the skin are not known, but it has been found that the transcription factor cDermo-1 induces the growth of feathers on skin and scales on the leg.

===Classification===

There are two basic types of feather: vaned feathers which cover the exterior of the body, and down feathers which are underneath the vaned feathers. The pennaceous feathers are vaned feathers. Also called contour feathers, pennaceous feathers arise from tracts and cover the entire body. A third rarer type of feather, the filoplume, is hairlike and are closely associated with pennaceous feathers and are often entirely hidden by them, with one or two filoplumes attached and sprouting from near the same point of the skin as each pennaceous feather, at least on a bird&#x27;s head, neck and trunk. Filoplumes are entirely absent in ratites. In some passerines, filoplumes arise exposed beyond the pennaceous feathers on the neck. The remiges, or flight feathers of the wing, and rectrices, or flight feathers of the tail, are the most important feathers for flight. A typical vaned feather features a main shaft, called the rachis. Fused to the rachis are a series of branches, or barbs; the barbs themselves are also branched and form the barbules. These barbules have minute hooks called barbicels for cross-attachment. Down feathers are fluffy because they lack barbicels, so the barbules float free of each other, allowing the down to trap air and provide excellent thermal insulation. At the base of the feather, the rachis expands to form the hollow tubular &quot;calamus&quot; (or quill) which inserts into a follicle in the skin. The basal part of the calamus is without vanes. This part is embedded within the skin follicle and has an opening at the base (proximal umbilicus) and a small opening on the side (distal umbilicus).

Hatchling birds of some species have a special kind of natal down feathers (neossoptiles) which are pushed out when the normal feathers (teleoptiles) emerge.

Flight feathers are stiffened so as to work against the air in the downstroke but yield in other directions. It has been observed that the orientation pattern of β-keratin fibers in the feathers of flying birds differs from that in flightless birds: the fibers are better aligned along the shaft axis direction towards the tip, and the lateral walls of rachis region show structure of crossed fibers.

===Functions===
Feathers insulate birds from water and cold temperatures. They may also be plucked to line the nest and provide insulation to the eggs and young. The individual feathers in the wings and tail play important roles in controlling flight. Some species have a crest of feathers on their heads. Although feathers are light, a bird&#x27;s plumage weighs two or three times more than its skeleton, since many bones are hollow and contain air sacs. Color patterns serve as camouflage against predators for birds in their habitats, and serve as camouflage for predators looking for a meal. As with fish, the top and bottom colors may be different, in order to provide camouflage during flight. Striking differences in feather patterns and colors are part of the sexual dimorphism of many bird species and are particularly important in the selection of mating pairs. In some cases, there are differences in the UV reflectivity of feathers across sexes even though no differences in color are noted in the visible range. The wing feathers of male club-winged manakins &quot;Machaeropterus deliciosus&quot; have special structures that are used to produce sounds by stridulation.

Some birds have a supply of powder down feathers that grow continuously, with small particles regularly breaking off from the ends of the barbules. These particles produce a powder that sifts through the feathers on the bird&#x27;s body and acts as a waterproofing agent and a feather conditioner. Powder down has evolved independently in several taxa and can be found in down as well as in pennaceous feathers. They may be scattered in plumage as in the pigeons and parrots or in localized patches on the breast, belly, or flanks, as in herons and frogmouths. Herons use their bill to break the powder down feathers and to spread them, while cockatoos may use their head as a powder puff to apply the powder. Waterproofing can be lost by exposure to emulsifying agents due to human pollution. Feathers can then become waterlogged, causing the bird to sink. It is also very difficult to clean and rescue birds whose feathers have been fouled by oil spills. The feathers of cormorants soak up water and help to reduce buoyancy, thereby allowing the birds to swim submerged.

Bristles are stiff, tapering feathers with a large rachis but few barbs. Rictal bristles are found around the eyes and bill. They may serve a similar purpose to eyelashes and vibrissae in mammals. Although there is as yet no clear evidence, it has been suggested that rictal bristles have sensory functions and may help insectivorous birds to capture prey. In one study, willow flycatchers (&quot;Empidonax traillii&quot;) were found to catch insects equally well before and after removal of the rictal bristles.

Grebes are peculiar in their habit of ingesting their own feathers and feeding them to their young. Observations on their diet of fish and the frequency of feather eating suggest that ingesting feathers, particularly down from their flanks, aids in forming easily ejectable pellets.

===Distribution===

Contour feathers are not uniformly distributed on the skin of the bird except in some groups such as the penguins, ratites and screamers. In most birds the feathers grow from specific tracts of skin called &quot;pterylae&quot;; between the pterylae there are regions which are free of feathers called &quot;apterylae&quot; (or &quot;apteria&quot;). Filoplumes and down may arise from the apterylae. The arrangement of these feather tracts, pterylosis or pterylography, varies across bird families and has been used in the past as a means for determining the evolutionary relationships of bird families. Species that incubate their own eggs often lose their feathers on a region of their belly, forming a brooding patch.

===Coloration===

The colors of feathers are produced by pigments, by microscopic structures that can refract, reflect, or scatter selected wavelengths of light, or by a combination of both.

Most feather pigments are melanins (brown and beige pheomelanins, black and grey eumelanins) and carotenoids (red, yellow, orange); other pigments occur only in certain taxa – the yellow to red psittacofulvins (found in some parrots) and the red turacin and green turacoverdin (porphyrin pigments found only in turacos).

Structural coloration is involved in the production of blue colors, iridescence, most ultraviolet reflectance and in the enhancement of pigmentary colors. Structural iridescence has been reported in fossil feathers dating back 40 million years. White feathers lack pigment and scatter light diffusely; albinism in birds is caused by defective pigment production, though structural coloration will not be affected (as can be seen, for example, in blue-and-white budgerigars).
The blues and bright greens of many parrots are produced by constructive interference of light reflecting from different layers of structures in feathers. In the case of green plumage, in addition to yellow, the specific feather structure involved is called by some the Dyck texture. Melanin is often involved in the absorption of light; in combination with a yellow pigment, it produces a dull olive-green.
In some birds, feather colors may be created, or altered, by secretions from the uropygial gland, also called the preen gland. The yellow bill colors of many hornbills are produced by such secretions. It has been suggested that there are other color differences that may be visible only in the ultraviolet region, but studies have failed to find evidence. The oil secretion from the uropygial gland may also have an inhibitory effect on feather bacteria.

The reds, orange and yellow colors of many feathers are caused by various carotenoids. Carotenoid-based pigments might be honest signals of fitness because they are derived from special diets and hence might be difficult to obtain, and/or because carotenoids are required for immune function and hence sexual displays come at the expense of health.

A bird&#x27;s feathers undergo wear and tear and are replaced periodically during the bird&#x27;s life through molting. New feathers, known when developing as blood, or pin feathers, depending on the stage of growth, are formed through the same follicles from which the old ones were fledged. The presence of melanin in feathers increases their resistance to abrasion. One study notes that melanin based feathers were observed to degrade more quickly under bacterial action, even compared to unpigmented feathers from the same species, than those unpigmented or with carotenoid pigments. However, another study the same year compared the action of bacteria on pigmentations of two song sparrow species and observed that the darker pigmented feathers were more resistant; the authors cited other research also published in 2004 that stated increased melanin provided greater resistance. They observed that the greater resistance of the darker birds confirmed Gloger&#x27;s rule.

Although sexual selection plays a major role in the development of feathers, in particular, the color of the feathers it is not the only conclusion available. New studies are suggesting that the unique feathers of birds are also a large influence on many important aspects of avian behavior, such as the height at which different species build their nests. Since females are the prime caregivers, evolution has helped select females to display duller colors down so that they may blend into the nesting environment. The position of the nest and whether it has a greater chance of being under predation has exerted constraints on female birds&#x27; plumage. A species of bird that nests on the ground, rather than the canopy of the trees, will need to have much duller colors in order not to attract attention to the nest. The height study found that birds that nest in the canopies of trees often have many more predator attacks due to the brighter color of feathers that the female displays. Another influence of evolution that could play a part in why feathers of birds are so colorful and display so many patterns could be due to that birds developed their bright colors from the vegetation and flowers that thrive around them. Birds develop their bright colors from living around certain colors. Most bird species often blend into their environment, due to some degree of camouflage, so if the species habitat is full of colors and patterns, the species would eventually evolve to blend in to avoid being eaten. Birds&#x27; feathers show a large range of colors, even exceeding the variety of many plants, leaf, and flower colors.

==Parasites==
The feather surface is the home for some ectoparasites, notably feather lice (Phthiraptera) and feather mites. Feather lice typically live on a single host and can move only from parents to chicks, between mating birds, and, occasionally, by phoresy. This life history has resulted in most of the parasite species being specific to the host and coevolving with the host, making them of interest in phylogenetic studies.

Feather holes are chewing traces of lice (most probably &quot;Brueelia&quot; spp. lice) on the wing and tail feathers. They were described on barn swallows, and because of easy countability, many evolutionary, ecological, and behavioral publications use them to quantify the intensity of infestation.

Parasitic cuckoos which grow up in the nests of other species also have host-specific feather lice and these seem to be transmitted only after the young cuckoos leave the host nest.

Birds maintain their feather condition by preening and bathing in water or dust. It has been suggested that a peculiar behavior of birds, anting, in which ants are introduced into the plumage, helps to reduce parasites, but no supporting evidence has been found.

==Human usage==

===Utilitarian ===
Bird feathers have long been used for fletching arrows. Colorful feathers such as those belonging to pheasants have been used to decorate fishing lures.

Feathers are also valuable in aiding the identification of species in forensic studies, particularly in bird strikes to aircraft. The ratios of hydrogen isotopes in feathers help in determining the geographic origins of birds. Feathers may also be useful in the non-destructive sampling of pollutants.

The poultry industry produces a large amount of feathers as waste, which, like other forms of keratin, are slow to decompose. Feather waste has been used in a number of industrial applications as a medium for culturing microbes, biodegradable polymers, and production of enzymes. Feather proteins have been tried as an adhesive for wood board.

Some groups of Native people in Alaska have used ptarmigan feathers as temper (non-plastic additives) in pottery manufacture since the first millennium BC in order to promote thermal shock resistance and strength.

===In religion and culture===

Eagle feathers have great cultural and spiritual value to Native Americans in the United States and First Nations peoples in Canada as religious objects. In the United States, the religious use of eagle and hawk feathers is governed by the eagle feather law, a federal law limiting the possession of eagle feathers to certified and enrolled members of federally recognized Native American tribes.

In South America, brews made from the feathers of condors are used in traditional medications. In India, feathers of the Indian peacock have been used in traditional medicine for snakebite, infertility, and coughs.

Members of Scotland&#x27;s Clan Campbell are known to wear feathers on their bonnets to signify authority within the clan. Clan chiefs wear three, chieftains wear two and an armiger wears one. Any member of the clan who does not meet the criteria is not authorized to wear feathers as part of traditional garb and doing so is considered presumptuous.

During the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries, there was a booming international trade in plumes for extravagant women&#x27;s hats and other headgear (including in Victorian fashion). Frank Chapman noted in 1886 that feathers of as many as 40 species of birds were used in about three-fourths of the 700 ladies&#x27; hats that he observed in New York City. For instance, South American hummingbird feathers were used in the past to dress some of the miniature birds featured in singing bird boxes. This trade caused severe losses to bird populations (for example, egrets and whooping cranes). Conservationists led a major campaign against the use of feathers in hats. This contributed to passage of the Lacey Act in 1900, and to changes in fashion. The ornamental feather market then largely collapsed.

More recently, rooster plumage has become a popular trend as a hairstyle accessory, with feathers formerly used as fishing lures now being used to provide color and style to hair.

Feather products manufacturing in Europe has declined in the last 60 years, mainly due to competition from Asia.
Feathers have adorned hats at many prestigious events such as weddings and Ladies Day at racecourses (Royal Ascot).

==Evolution==
=== Functional considerations ===
The functional view on the evolution of feathers has traditionally focused on insulation, flight and display. Discoveries of non-flying Late Cretaceous feathered dinosaurs in China, however, suggest that flight could not have been the original primary function as the feathers simply would not have been capable of providing any form of lift. There have been suggestions that feathers may have had their original function in thermoregulation, waterproofing, or even as sinks for metabolic wastes such as sulphur. Recent discoveries are argued to support a thermoregulatory function, at least in smaller dinosaurs. Some researchers even argue that thermoregulation arose from bristles on the face that were used as tactile sensors. While feathers have been suggested as having evolved from reptilian scales, there are numerous objections to that idea, and more recent explanations have arisen from the paradigm of evolutionary developmental biology. Theories of the scale-based origins of feathers suggest that the planar scale structure was modified for development into feathers by splitting to form the webbing; however, that developmental process involves a tubular structure arising from a follicle and the tube splitting longitudinally to form the webbing. The number of feathers per unit area of skin is higher in smaller birds than in larger birds, and this trend points to their important role in thermal insulation, since smaller birds lose more heat due to the relatively larger surface area in proportion to their body weight. The miniaturization of birds also played a role in the evolution of powered flight. The coloration of feathers is believed to have evolved primarily in response to sexual selection. In fossil specimens of the paravian &quot;Anchiornis huxleyi&quot; and the pterosaur &quot;Tupandactylus imperator&quot;, the features are so well preserved that the melanosome (pigment cells) structure can be observed. By comparing the shape of the fossil melanosomes to melanosomes from extant birds, the color and pattern of the feathers on &quot;Anchiornis&quot; and &quot;Tupandactylus&quot; could be determined. &quot;Anchiornis&quot; was found to have black-and-white-patterned feathers on the forelimbs and hindlimbs, with a reddish-brown crest. This pattern is similar to the coloration of many extant bird species, which use plumage coloration for display and communication, including sexual selection and camouflage. It is likely that non-avian dinosaur species utilized plumage patterns for similar functions as modern birds before the origin of flight. In many cases, the physiological condition of the birds (especially males) is indicated by the quality of their feathers, and this is used (by the females) in mate choice. Additionally, when comparing different &quot;Ornithomimus edmontonicus&quot; specimens, older individuals were found to have a pennibrachium (a wing-like structure consisting of elongate feathers), while younger ones did not. This suggests that the pennibrachium was a secondary sex characteristic and likely had a sexual function.

=== Molecular evolution ===
Several genes have been found to determine feather development. They will be key to understand the evolution of feathers. For instance, some genes convert scales into feathers or feather-like structures when expressed or induced in bird feet, such as the scale-feather converters Sox2, Zic1, Grem1, Spry2, and Sox18.

Feathers and scales are made up of two distinct forms of keratin, and it was long thought that each type of keratin was exclusive to each skin structure (feathers and scales). However, feather keratin is also present in the early stages of development of American alligator scales. This type of keratin, previously thought to be specific to feathers, is suppressed during embryological development of the alligator and so is not present in the scales of mature alligators. The presence of this homologous keratin in both birds and crocodilians indicates that it was inherited from a common ancestor.

This may suggest that crocodilian scales, bird and dinosaur feathers, and pterosaur pycnofibres are all developmental expressions of the same primitive archosaur skin structures; suggesting that feathers and pycnofibers could be homologous. Molecular dating methods in 2011 show that the subfamily of feather β-keratins found in extant birds started to diverge 143 million years ago, suggesting the pennaceous feathers of &quot;Anchiornis&quot; were not made of the feather β-keratins present in extant birds. However, a study of fossil feathers from the dinosaur Sinosauropteryx and other fossils revealed traces of beta-sheet proteins, using infrared spectroscopy and sulfur-X-ray spectroscopy. The presence of abundant alpha-proteins in some fossil feathers was shown to be an artefact of the fossilization process, as beta-protein structures are readily altered to alpha-helices during thermal degradation. In 2019, scientists found that genes for the production of feathers evolved at the base of archosauria, supporting that feathers were present at early ornithodirans and is consistent with the fossil record.

===Feathered dinosaurs===
Several non-avian dinosaurs had feathers on their limbs that would not have functioned for flight. One theory suggests that feathers originally evolved on dinosaurs due to their insulation properties; then, small dinosaur species which grew longer feathers may have found them helpful in gliding, leading to the evolution of proto-birds like &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; and &quot;Microraptor zhaoianus&quot;. Another theory posits that the original adaptive advantage of early feathers was their pigmentation or iridescence, contributing to sexual preference in mate selection. Dinosaurs that had feathers or protofeathers include &quot;Pedopenna daohugouensis&quot; and &quot;Dilong paradoxus&quot;, a tyrannosauroid which is 60 to 70 million years older than &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex.&quot;

The majority of dinosaurs known to have had feathers or protofeathers are theropods, however featherlike &quot;filamentous integumentary structures&quot; are also known from the ornithischian dinosaurs &quot;Tianyulong&quot; and &quot;Psittacosaurus&quot;. The exact nature of these structures is still under study. However, it is believed that the stage-1 feathers (see Evolutionary stages section below) such as those seen in these two ornithischians likely functioned in display. In 2014, the ornithischian &quot;Kulindadromeus&quot; was reported as having structures resembling stage-3 feathers. The likelihood of scales evolving on early dinosaur ancestors are high. However, this was by assuming that primitive pterosaurs were scaly. A 2016 study analyzes the pulp morphology of the tail bristles of &quot;Psittacosaurus&quot; and finds they are similar to feathers but notes that they are also similar to the bristles on the head of the Congo peafowl, the beard of the turkey, and the spine on the head of the horned screamer. A reestimation of maximum likelihoods by paleontologist Thomas Holtz finds that filaments were more likely to be the ancestral state of dinosaurs.

In 2010, a carcharodontosaurid named &quot;Concavenator corcovatus&quot; was found to have remiges on the ulna suggesting it might have had quill-like structures on the ams. However, Foth et al. 2014 disagress with the publication where they point out that the bumps on the ulna of &quot;Concavenator&quot; are on the anterolateral which is unlike remiges which are in a posterolateral on the ulna of some birds, they consider it more likely that these are attachments for interosseous ligaments. This was refuted by Cuesta Fidalgo and her colleagues, they pointed out that these bumps on the ulna are posterolateral which is unlike that of interosseous ligaments.

Since the 1990s, dozens of feathered dinosaurs have been discovered in the clade Maniraptora, which includes the clade Avialae and the recent common ancestors of birds, Oviraptorosauria and Deinonychosauria. In 1998, the discovery of a feathered oviraptorosaurian, &quot;Caudipteryx zoui&quot;, challenged the notion of feathers as a structure exclusive to Avialae. Buried in the Yixian Formation in Liaoning, China, &quot;C. zoui&quot; lived during the Early Cretaceous Period. Present on the forelimbs and tails, their integumentary structure has been accepted as pennaceous vaned feathers based on the rachis and herringbone pattern of the barbs. In the clade Deinonychosauria, the continued divergence of feathers is also apparent in the families Troodontidae and Dromaeosauridae. Branched feathers with rachis, barbs, and barbules were discovered in many members including &quot;Sinornithosaurus millenii&quot;, a dromaeosaurid found in the Yixian formation (124.6 MYA).

Previously, a temporal paradox existed in the evolution of feathers—theropods with highly derived bird-like characteristics occurred at a later time than &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;—suggesting that the descendants of birds arose before the ancestor. However, the discovery of &quot;Anchiornis huxleyi&quot; in the Late Jurassic Tiaojishan Formation (160 MYA) in western Liaoning in 2009
resolved this paradox. By predating &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, &quot;Anchiornis&quot; proves the existence of a modernly feathered theropod ancestor, providing insight into the dinosaur-bird transition. The specimen shows distribution of large pennaceous feathers on the forelimbs and tail, implying that pennaceous feathers spread to the rest of the body at an earlier stage in theropod evolution. The development of pennaceous feathers did not replace earlier filamentous feathers. Filamentous feathers are preserved alongside modern-looking flight feathers – including some with modifications found in the feathers of extant diving birds – in 80 million year old amber from Alberta.

Two small wings trapped in amber dating to 100 mya show plumage existed in some bird predecessors. The wings most probably belonged to enantiornithes, a diverse group of avian dinosaurs.

A large phylogenetic analysis of early dinosaurs by Matthew Baron, David B. Norman and Paul Barrett (2017) found that Theropoda is actually more closely related to Ornithischia, to which it formed the sister group within the clade Ornithoscelida. The study also suggested that if the feather-like structures of theropods and ornithischians are of common evolutionary origin then it would be possible that feathers were restricted to Ornithoscelida. If so, then the origin of feathers would have likely occurred as early as the Middle Triassic, though this has been disagreed upon. The lack of feathers present in large sauropods and ankylosaurs could be that feathers were suppressed by genomic regulators.

===Evolutionary stages===

Several studies of feather development in the embryos of modern birds, coupled with the distribution of feather types among various prehistoric bird precursors, have allowed scientists to attempt a reconstruction of the sequence in which feathers first evolved and developed into the types found on modern birds.

Feather evolution was broken down into the following stages by Xu and Guo in 2009:
# Single filament
# Multiple filaments joined at their base
# Multiple filaments joined at their base to a central filament
# Multiple filaments along the length of a central filament
# Multiple filaments arising from the edge of a membranous structure
# Pennaceous feather with vane of barbs and barbules and central rachis
# Pennaceous feather with an asymmetrical rachis
# Undifferentiated vane with central rachis

However, Foth (2011) showed that some of these purported stages (stages 2 and 5 in particular) are likely simply artifacts of preservation caused by the way fossil feathers are crushed and the feather remains or imprints are preserved. Foth re-interpreted stage 2 feathers as crushed or misidentified feathers of at least stage 3, and stage 5 feathers as crushed stage 6 feathers.

The following simplified diagram of dinosaur relationships follows these results, and shows the likely distribution of plumaceous (downy) and pennaceous (vaned) feathers among dinosaurs and prehistoric birds. The diagram follows one presented by Xu and Guo (2009) modified with the findings of Foth (2011). The numbers accompanying each name refer to the presence of specific feather stages. Note that &#x27;s&#x27; indicates the known presence of scales on the body.

=== In pterosaurs ===

Pterosaurs were long known to have filamentous fur-like structures covering their body known as pycnofibres, which were generally considered distinct from the &quot;true feathers&quot; of birds and their dinosaur kin. However, a 2018 study of two small, well-preserved pterosaur fossils from the Jurassic of Inner Mongolia, China indicated that pterosaurs were covered in an array of differently-structured pycnofibres (rather than just filamentous ones), with several of these structures displaying diagnostic features of feathers, such as non-veined grouped filaments and bilaterally branched filaments, both of which were originally thought to be exclusive to birds and other maniraptoran dinosaurs. Given these findings, it is possible that feathers have deep evolutionary origins in ancestral archosaurs, though there is also a possibility that these structures independently evolved to resemble bird feathers via convergent evolution. Mike Benton, the study&#x27;s senior author, lent credence to the former theory, stating &quot;We couldn&#x27;t find any anatomical evidence that the four pycnofiber types are in any way different from the feathers of birds and dinosaurs. Therefore, because they are the same, they must share an evolutionary origin, and that was about 250 million years ago, long before the origin of birds.&quot; But the integumentary structures of the anurognathid specimens is still based gross morphology as Liliana D&#x27;Alba pointed out. The pycnofibres of the two anurognathid specimens might not be homologous with the filamentous appendages on dinosaurs. Paul M. Barrett suspects that during the integumentary evolution of pterosaurs, pterosaurs primitively lost scales and pycnofibers started to appear. 

&quot;Cascocauda&quot; was almost entirely covered in an extensive coat of pycnofibres, which appear to have come in two types. The first are simple, curved filaments that range in length from 3.5–12.8 mm long. These filaments cover most of the animal, including the head, neck, body, limbs and tail. The second type consists of tufts of filaments joined near the base, similar to the branching down feathers of birds and other coelurosaurian dinosaurs, around 2.5–8.0 mm long and only cover the wing membranes. Studies of sampled pycnofibres revealed the presence of microbodies within the filaments, resembling the melanosome pigments identified in other fossil integuments, specifically phaeomelanosomes. Furthermore, infrared spectral analysis of these pycnofibres show similar absorption spectra to red human hair. These pycnofibres likely provided both insulation and may have helped streamline the body and wings during flight.
The identity of these branching structures as pycnofibres or feathers was challenged by Unwin &amp; Martill (2020), who interpreted them as bunched-up and degraded aktinofibrils–stiffening fibres found in the wing membrane of pterosaurs–and attributed the melanosomes and keratin to skin rather than filaments. These claims were refuted by Yang and colleagues, who argue that Unwin and Martill&#x27;s interpretations are inconsistent with the specimen&#x27;s preservation. Namely, they argue that the consistent structure, regular spacing, and extension of the filaments beyond the wing membrane support their identification as pycnofibres. Further, they argue that the restriction of melanosomes and keratin to the fibres, as occurs in fossil dinosaur feathers, supports the case they are filaments and is not consistent with contamination from preserved skin. Protofeathers likely evolved in early archosaurs, not long after the P-T extinction event during the time metabolic rates of early archosaurs and synapsids were increasing, postures becoming erect, and sustained activity.

<text>Madagascar is a large island in the Indian Ocean located off the eastern coast of Southern Africa, east of Mozambique. It has a total area of with of land and of water. Madagascar is the fourth-largest island in the world. The highest point is Maromokotro, in the Tsaratanana Massif region in the north of the island, at .

The Republic of Madagascar is the second-largest island country in the world. Its capital Antananarivo is in the Central Highlands near the centre of the island. It has the 25th largest exclusive economic zone of .

==Geographical regions==

Madagascar can be divided into five general geographical regions: the east coast, the Tsaratanana Massif, the Central Highlands, the west coast, and the southwest. The highest elevations parallel the east coast. The total size is , which makes it the world&#x27;s second largest island country.

===East coast===
The east coast consists of a narrow band of lowlands about wide, formed from the sedimentation of alluvial soils, and an intermediate zone composed of steep bluffs alternating with ravines bordering an escarpment of about in elevation, which gives access to the Central Highlands. The coastal region runs roughly from north of Baie d&#x27;Antongil, the most prominent feature on the Masoala Peninsula, to the far north of the island. The coastline is straight, with the exception of a bay, offering less in the way of natural harbors than the west coast.

The Canal des Pangalanes, an -long lagoon formed naturally by the washing of sand up on the island by the Indian Ocean currents and by the silting of rivers, is a feature of the coast; it has been used both as a means of transportation up and down the coast and as a fishing area. The beach slopes steeply into deep water. The east coast is considered dangerous for swimmers and sailors because of the large number of sharks that frequent the shoreline.

===Tsaratanana Massif===
The Tsaratanana Massif region at the north end of the island contains Maromokotro, the highest point on the island at . Further north is the Montagne d&#x27;Ambre (Ambohitra), which is of volcanic origin. The coastline is deeply indented; two prominent features are the natural harbor at Antsiranana (Diego Suárez), just south of the Cap d&#x27;Ambre (Tanjon&#x27; i Bobaomby), and the large island of Nosy Be to the west. The mountainous topography of the Tsaratanana Massif limits the potential of the port at Antsiranana by impeding the flow of traffic from other parts of the island. They are a focus for big wall climbing.

===Central Highlands===
The Central Highlands, which range from in elevation, contain a wide variety of topographies: rounded and eroded hills, massive granite outcrops, extinct volcanoes, eroded peneplains, and alluvial plains and marshes, which have been converted into irrigated rice fields. The Central Highlands extend from the Tsaratanana Massif in the north to the Ivakoany Massif in the south. They are defined rather clearly by the escarpments along the east coast, and they slope gently to the west coast. The Central Highlands include the Anjafy High Plateaus; the volcanic formations of Itasy (Lake Itasy is in a volcanic crater) and the Ankaratra Massif, reaching a height of . The Isalo Ruiniform Massif lies between the central highlands and the west coast.

Antananarivo, the national capital, is located in the northern portion of the Central Highlands at above sea level. A prominent feature of the Central Highlands is a rift valley running north to south, located east of Antananarivo and including Lac Alaotra, the largest body of water on the island. The lake is located above sea level and is bordered by two cliffs, rising to the west and to the east, which form the walls of a valley. This region has experienced geological subsidence, and earth tremors are frequent.

===West coast===
The west coast, composed of sedimentary formations, is more indented than the east coast, thus offering a number of harbors sheltered from cyclones, such as the harbor at Mahajanga. Deep bays and well-protected harbors have attracted explorers, traders, and pirates from Europe, Africa, and the Middle East since ancient times; thus, the area has served as an important bridge between Madagascar and the outside world. Silting up of harbors on this coast, caused by sediment from the high levels of erosion suffered inland in Madagascar, is a major problem. The broad alluvial plains found on the coast between Mahajanga and Toliara, which are believed to have great agricultural potential, are thinly inhabited, in many places covered with swamps of Madagascar mangroves, and remain largely unexplored, although they are the subject of mineral and hydrocarbon exploration activity. The giant oil fields of Tsimiroro (heavy oil) and Bemolanga (ultra heavy oil) lie towards the west of the island.

===Southwest===
The southwest is bordered on the east by the Ivakoany Massif and on the north by the Isalo Ruiniform Massif. It includes two regions along the south coast, the Mahafaly Plateau and the desert region occupied by the Antandroy people.

==Rivers and lakes==

The Mananara and Mangoro rivers flow from the Central Highlands to the east coast, as does the Maningory, which flows from Lake Alaotra. Other rivers flowing east into the Indian Ocean include the Bemarivo, the Ivondro, and the Mananjary. These rivers tend to be short because the watershed is located close to the east coast. Owing to the steep elevations, they flow rapidly, often over spectacular waterfalls.

The rivers flowing to the west coast discharge into the Mozambique Channel and tend to be lengthier and have a lesser gradient. The major rivers on the west coast are the Sambirano, the Mahajamba, the Betsiboka (part of Mahajanga is located at the mouth), the Mania, the North and South Mahavavy, the Mangoky, and the Onilahy. The Ikopa, which flows past Antananarivo, is a tributary of the Betsiboka. The Onilahy, located in the driest part of the island, occasionally dries up during droughts.

Important lakes, aside from Alaotra, include Lake Kinkony in the northwest, Lake Itasy in the center and Lake Ihotry in the southwest.

==Geographic features==
===Somali Plate===
Madagascar originated as part of the Gondwana supercontinent. Its west coast was formed when Africa broke off from Gondwana around 165 million years ago. Madagascar eventually broke off from India about 88 million years ago. It is geologically located within the Somali Plate.

===Soils===

Madagascar has been called the &quot;Great Red Island&quot; because of the prominence of red lateritic soils. The red soils predominate the Central Highlands, although there are much richer soils in the regions of former volcanic activity, Itasy and Ankaratra, and Tsaratanana to the north. A narrow band of alluvial soils is found all along the east coast and at the mouths of the major rivers on the west coast; clay, sand, and limestone mixtures are found in the west; and shallow or skeletal laterite and limestone are located in the south. Deforestation and grazing cause aggressive erosion in many locations.

===Tidal Flats===
A 2019 global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were of tidal flats in Madagascar, making it the 18th ranked country in terms of how much tidal flat occurs there.

==Climate==

The climate is tropical along the coast, temperate inland, and arid in the south. The weather is dominated by the southeastern trade winds that originate in the Indian Ocean anticyclone, a center of high atmospheric pressure that seasonally changes its position over the ocean. Madagascar has two seasons: a warm, wet season from November to April; and a cooler, dry season from May to October. There is, however, great variation in climate owing to elevation and position relative to dominant winds. Overall, surface water is most abundant along the east coast and in the far north (with the exception of the area around Cap d&#x27;Ambre, which has relatively little surface water). Amounts diminish to the west and south, and the driest regions are in the extreme south.

The east coast has a tropical rainforest climate; being most directly exposed to the trade winds, it has the highest rainfall, averaging as high as annually in some places. This region has a hot, humid climate in which tropical fevers are endemic. Destructive cyclones occur during the rainy season, coming in principally from the direction of the Mascarene Islands. Because rain clouds discharge much of their moisture east of the highest elevations on the island, the Central Highlands are drier and, owing to the altitude, also cooler. Thunderstorms are common during the rainy season in the Central Highlands and the eastern coastal lowlands.

Antananarivo receives practically all of its average annual of rainfall between November and April. The dry season is sunny, although somewhat chilly, especially in the mornings. Although frosts are rare in Antananarivo, they are common at higher elevations. Hail is common in many of the higher areas of the island (including Antananarivo), but there is no snowfall except on the Ankaratra massif where above it may occasionally fall and even remain for several days.

The west coast is drier than either the east coast or the Central Highlands because the trade winds lose their humidity by the time they reach this region. The southwest and the extreme south are semidesert; as little as of rain falls annually at Toliara.



=== Climate change ===
=== Cyclones ===
Madagascar occasionally experiences the impact of cyclones. During February 2–4, 1994, Madagascar was struck by Cyclone Geralda. The cyclone killed seventy people and destroyed enough property to leave approximately 500,000 homeless, including 30,000 in Antananarivo and 80,000 in Toamasina. The cyclone also significantly damaged the country&#x27;s infrastructure, most notably coastal roads, railroads, and telecommunications, as well as agriculture. The damage was estimated at US$45 million.

During March 1–18, 2004, Madagascar was impacted by Cyclone Gafilo, the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the South-West Indian Ocean. The National Rescue Council in Antananarivo reported 237 dead, 181 missing, 879 injured, and 304,000 homeless (174,000 in Antalaha alone). More than 20,000 homes were destroyed, as well as 413 public buildings and 3,400 schools were damaged, including 1,400 schools completely destroyed. The Cyclone left an estimated damage of US$250 million.

In February 2022, Cyclone Batsirai killed at least 10 people and caused floods, power outages, and structural damages, mere weeks after Cyclone Ana had killed 55 and displaced 130,000 people on the island.

==Flora and fauna==

The island of Madagascar has been described as an &quot;alternate world&quot; or a &quot;world apart&quot; because of the uniqueness and rarity of many of its plant and animal species. Their characteristics are believed to reflect the island&#x27;s origins as a part of Gondwanaland and its many millions of years of isolation following the breakup of the landmass.

Many of the characteristic African species—large mammals such as the elephant, rhinoceros, giraffe, zebra, and antelope and predators such as lions and leopards—do not exist in Madagascar. In addition, the island has been spared the great variety of venomous snakes indigenous to the African continent. Although it is assumed that most life forms on the island had an African (or South American) origin, isolation has allowed old species—elsewhere extinct—to survive and new species unique to the island to evolve. Thus, a great number of plant, insect, reptile, and fish species are endemic to Madagascar, and all indigenous land mammal species—66 in all—are unique to the island.

Madagascar was once covered almost completely by forests, but slash and burn practices for dry rice cultivation has denuded most of the landscape, especially in the Central Highlands. Rain forests are concentrated on the steep hillsides along a slender north–south axis bordering the east coast, from the Tsaratanana Massif in the north to Tolagnaro in the south. Secondary growth, which has replaced the original forest and consists to a large extent of traveller&#x27;s trees, raffia palm, and baobabs, is found in many places along the east coast and in the north. The vegetation of the Central Highlands and the west coast is for the most part savanna or steppe, and coarse prairie grass predominates where erosion has not exposed the orange-red lateritic soil. In the southwest, the vegetation is adapted to desert conditions.

The remaining rain forest contains a great number of unique plant species. The country has some 900 species of orchid. Bananas, mangoes, coconut, vanilla, and other tropical plants grow on the coasts, and the eucalyptus tree, brought from Australia, is widespread today.

Wood and charcoal from the forests are used to meet 80% of domestic fuel needs. As a result, wood has become scarce. In 1990, the World Bank launched an environmental program that has increased the planting of pine and eucalyptus to satisfy fuel needs.

==Natural resources==

Madagascar has a number of natural resources, including nickel, cobalt, graphite, chromite, coal, bauxite, rare Earth elements, salt, quartz, tar sands, semi-precious stones and mica. There are also fishing areas offshore and potential for hydropower. 
In 2011, it was estimated that 5.96% of the land area was used for arable land and 1.02% had permanent crops. Twenty-six percent of the land is forested. 
The majority of the population depends on subsistence farming, largely rice and cattle. The manufacturing sector is small but growing.

==Environmental issues==

Madagascar is currently suffering in some areas from soil erosion as a result of deforestation and overgrazing, desertification, and contamination of surface water with raw sewage and organic waste. Several species of flora and fauna that are unique to the islands are endangered. Regular cyclones cause flooding in low-lying coastal regions.

<text>The History of Madagascar started from the ancient supercontinent of Pangaea, containing amongst others the African continent and the Indian subcontinent, and by the island&#x27;s late colonization by human settlers from the Sunda Islands (Malay Archipelago) and from East Africa. 
These two factors facilitated the evolution and survival of thousands of endemic plant and animal species, some of which have gone extinct or are currently threatened with extinction.
Trade in the Indian Ocean at the time of first colonization of Madagascar was dominated by Indonesian ships, probably of Borobudur ship and K&#x27;un-lun po types.

Over two thousand years, the island has received waves of settlers of diverse origins, primarily Austronesian and Bantu. Centuries of intermarriages between both groups created the Malagasy people, who are roughly an equal mixture of both groups. They speak the Malagasy, an Austronesian language with Bantu, French and Arabic influences. 

By the Middle Ages, over a dozen distinct ethnic identities had emerged on the island, typified by rule under a local chieftain. Some communities, such as the Sakalava, Merina and Betsimisaraka, were unified by leaders who established kingdoms, which gained wealth and power through commerce with Europeans and Arabs. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, pirate activity in the coastal areas of Madagascar was common. The Sakalava and Merina kingdoms in particular exploited European trade to strengthen the power of their kingdoms, trading Malagasy slaves for European firearms and other goods. Beginning in the early 19th century, the British and French competed for influence in Madagascar.

By the turn of the 19th century, King Andrianampoinimerina had reunited the highly populous Kingdom of Imerina in the central highlands, with its capital at Antananarivo. His son Radama I the Great expanded its authority to the island&#x27;s other polities and was the first Malagasy sovereign to be recognized by foreign states as the ruler of the greater Merina Kingdom. During the rule of Queen Ranavalona I (r. 1828–1861), the kingdom was further expanded to encompass most of the island. Madagascar&#x27;s population is estimated to have declined by half from 5 million to 2.5 million between 1833 and 1839 from war, disease, slavery and other and violence. She also attempted to eradicate European and Christian influence in the country.

Christianity was made the state religion under Queen Ranavalona II (r. 1868–1883). In the 1880s, Britain recognised France&#x27;s authority on the island. This led in 1890 to the Malagasy Protectorate, which was however rejected by the Kingdom of Madagascar, which led to the two Franco-Hova Wars which ended with France capturing the capital in September 1895. Conflict continued in the Menalamba rebellion against French rule that was defeated in 1897. The monarchy was dissolved, and the queen was exiled. Following conquest, the French abolished slavery in 1896, freeing approximately 500,000 slaves.

During French rule, Malagasy people were required to fulfill corvée labor on French-run plantations while access to education or skilled positions were limited, although basic services like schools and clinics were extended across the island. Several militant nationalist secret societies emerged in opposition to French rule, of which the most prominent was Vy Vato Sakelika formed in 1913. Many Malagasy were conscripted to fight for France during the First (1914–1918) and Second World Wars (1939–1945), and during the latter Madagascar came under Vichy French control before being captured by the British in the Battle of Madagascar and returned to Free French control in 1942. In 1944, Madagascar became an overseas territory with representatives in the French National Assembly. Militant nationalists launched a large uprising in 1947 that was brutally suppressed by 1949. 

The country gained full independence from France in 1960. Madagascar&#x27;s First Republic (1960–1972) was established as a democratic system modeled on that of France and led by President Philibert Tsiranana. Popular unrest led to the socialist Democratic Republic of Madagascar under Admiral Didier Ratsiraka (1975–1992) distinguished by economic isolationism and political alliances with pro-Soviet states. By 1992, free and fair multiparty elections were held, ushering in the democratic Third Republic (1992–2009). Under the new constitution, the Malagasy public elected successive presidents Albert Zafy, Didier Ratsiraka, and Marc Ravalomanana. This latter was ousted in the 2009 Malagasy political crisis by a popular movement under the leadership of Andry Rajoelina. Elections were held on December 20, 2013, to elect a new president and return the country to constitutional governance.

== First inhabitants and settlements (500 BCE–700 CE) ==
=== Archaeological evidence for date of first settlement ===
The earliest unambiguous evidence of continuous human presence in Madagascar was found at Andavakoera and dates to 490 CE, and there is no archaeological evidence for human occupation in the highlands until around 1200. However, there is scattered evidence for much earlier human visits.

In 2009, archaeological excavations at Christmas River (south-central Madagascar) by Pat Wright and James Hansford located a purported elephant bird kill site, with bones showing human cut marks. These were dated to 8,500 BCE, but as yet there is no indication as to the identity of the hunters. Archaeological finds such as cut marks on bones found in the northwest and stone tools in the northeast indicate that Madagascar was visited by foragers around 2000 BCE.

There is potential evidence in the form of a cutmarked subfossil lemur bone from a palaeontological site, Taolambiby, in the southwest. One date was obtained, calibrated 530 to 300 BC (Godfrey &amp; Jungers 2003). The cutmarking looks plausible, but there is a potential problem of old carbon from the limestone landscape compromising the date, and there are no associated artifacts or archaeological sites in the vicinity. Nearly contemporaneous potential evidence comes from cannabis or humulus pollen which occurs in a pollen column from the central highlands at an interpolated date of c. 2200 Before Present (BP). There is a hypothesis that cannabis may have reached Africa 3000 years ago.

Necho II&#x27;s Phoenician expedition c. 595 BCE circumnavigated Africa but did not see Madagascar when passing through the Mozambique Channel, as it stayed within sight of the African mainland. The island was likely uninhabited.

Finally, a cutmarked pygmy hippo bone from Ambolisatra has been dated and calibrated to between 60 BC and 130 AD (2 SDs), but it is from a coastal swamp without indications of settlement in a heavily karstic region. Moreover, a similar bone from the same collection from a nearby site gave two widely divergent dates of 2020 and 3495 BC (MacPhee &amp; Burney 1991). Transient visits to Madagascar that did not result in enduring settlement cannot be ruled out, and may have left some traces.

=== A common Austronesian origin: The &quot;Vahoaka Ntaolo&quot; ===
Factual information about the peopling of Madagascar remains incomplete, but much recent multidisciplinary research and work in archaeology, genetics, linguistics, and history confirms that the Malagasy people were originally and overwhelmingly Austronesian peoples native to the Sunda Islands. They probably arrived on the west coast of Madagascar with outrigger canoes (&quot;waka&quot;) at the beginning of our era or as much as 300 years sooner according to archaeologists, and perhaps even earlier under certain geneticists&#x27; assumptions. On the basis of plant cultigens, Blench proposed the migrations occurred &quot;at the earliest century BCE&quot;. Archaeological work of Ardika and Bellwood suggests migration between 500 and 200 BCE.

The Borobudur Ship Expedition in 2003–2004 affirmed scholars&#x27; ideas that ships from ancient Indonesia could have reached Madagascar and the west African coast for trade from the 8th century and after. A traditional Borobudur ship with outriggers was reconstructed and sailed in this expedition from Jakarta to Madagascar and Ghana. As for the ancient route, one possibility is that Indonesian Austronesians came directly across the Indian Ocean from Java to Madagascar. It is likely that they went through the Maldives where evidence of old Indonesian boat design and fishing technology persists until the present. The Malagasy language originated from the Southeast Barito language, and Ma&#x27;anyan language is its closest relative, with numerous Malay and Javanese loanwords. It is known that Ma&#x27;anyan people were brought as laborers and slaves by Malay and Javanese people in their trading fleets, which reached Madagascar by ca. 50–500 AD. These pioneers are known in the Malagasy oral tradition as the &quot;Ntaolo&quot;, from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian &quot;*tau-ulu&quot;, literally &#x27;first men&#x27;, from &quot;*tau&quot;, &#x27;man&#x27;, and &quot;*ulu&quot;, &#x27;head; first; origin, beginning. It is likely that those ancient people called themselves *&quot;va-waka&quot;, &quot;the canoe people&quot; from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian &quot;*va&quot;, &#x27;people&#x27;, and &quot;*waka&quot; &#x27;canoe&#x27;. Today the term means &#x27;people&#x27; in Malagasy.

The Southeast Asian origin of the first Malagasy people explains certain features common among the Malagasy, for instance, the epicanthic fold common among all Malagasy whether coastal or highlands, whether pale, dark or copper skinned. This original population (&quot;vahoaka ntaolo&quot;) can be called the &quot;Proto-Malagasy&quot;. They are the source of:
* the Malagasy language, common to the whole island, which shares many common roots with the Austronesian languages of Barito subgroup, which originated in South Kalimantan, such as Ma&#x27;anyan.
* Malagasy cultural traditions shared with Austronesians of Taiwan, the Pacific Islands, Indonesia, New Zealand, and the Philippines including ancient customs, such as burying the dead within a canoe in the sea or in a lake, the cultivation of traditional Austronesian crops such as taro or , banana, coconut, and sugar cane, traditional architecture with a square house plan, music and musical instruments such as the conch, the drum, the xylophone, flute, or the tube zither, and dance, including the &quot;bird dance&quot; found both in central and southern regions.

As for the cause of the coming of these Austronesians, the history of the Indian Ocean from the early first millennium CE is still poorly understood. Madagascar may have played an important role in the trade of spices (especially cinnamon) and timber between Southeast Asia and the Middle East, directly or through the African coast and Madagascar.

===&quot;Vazimba&quot; and &quot;Vezo&quot;===
The first known concentrated population of human settlers emerged along the southeastern coast of the island, although the first landfall may have been made on the northern coast. Upon arrival, early settlers practiced &quot;tavy&quot; (slash-and-burn agriculture) to clear the virgin coastal rainforests for the cultivation of their crops. The first settlers encountered Madagascar&#x27;s wealth of megafauna, including giant lemurs, elephant birds, giant fossa and the Malagasy hippopotamus, which have since become extinct due to hunting and habitat destruction.

By 600, groups of these early settlers had moved inland and began clearing the forests of the central highlands (&quot;Imerina&quot;), where they particularly planted taro (&quot;saonjo&quot;) and probably rice (&quot;vary&quot;). These &quot;Vahoaka Ntaolo&quot;, hunters-gatherers and farmers, who decided to settle &quot;in the forest&quot;, especially in the forests of the central highlands are known by the tradition as the Vazimba (from &quot;*ba/va-yimba-&quot; &#x27;those of the forest&#x27;, from &quot;*yimba-&quot; &#x27;forest&#x27; in Proto–Southeast Barito, today &quot;barimba&quot; or &quot;orang rimba&quot; in Malay). Rafandrana, an ancestor of the Merina royal dynasty, for example, is known to have been a Vazimba. Rafohy and Rangita, the two founding queens of the Merina royalty, were also called Vazimbas.

On the other side, the fishermen who, from the beginning, remained on the southwestern coast (probably the coasts of the first landing) were, according to the linguists, probably originally called the &quot;Vezo&quot; (from &quot;*ba/va/be/ve-jau&quot; – &quot;those of the coast&quot;, borrowed from Proto-Malayo-Javanese, today &quot;veju&quot; in Bugis, &quot;bejau&quot; in Malay, and &quot;bajo&quot; in Javanese), which today is still the name of a Southwestern tribe.

After the arrival of the newcomers (see below), as growing population density necessitated higher crop yields, irrigated rice paddies emerged in Betsileo country by 1600 and were complemented with terraced paddies throughout the central highlands a century later. Zebu were introduced around 1000 by Bantu-speaking migrants from the African Great Lakes region (see below), who maintained large herds. The rising intensity of land cultivation and the ever-increasing demand for zebu pasturage in the central highlands had largely transformed the region from a forest ecosystem to barren grassland by the 17th century.

==Traders, explorers, and immigration (700–1500)==
By the mid-first millennium (ca 700) until about 1500, the inner Vazimbas as much as the coastal Vezos clans welcomed new visitors or immigrants. These goods and/or slave traders came from the Middle East (Shirazi Persians, Omani Arabs, Arab Jews), Africa (Swahilis), and from Asia (Gujaratis, Malays, Javanese, Bugis). They were sometimes integrated within the coastal Vezos and the inner Vazimbas clans.

===Omani Arabs (from the 7th century)===
The written history of Madagascar begins in the 7th century when Omanis established trading posts along the northwest coast and introduced Islam, the Arabic script (used to transcribe the Malagasy language in a form of writing known as the sorabe alphabet), Arab astrology and other cultural elements. During this early period, Madagascar served as an important transoceanic trading port for the East African coast that gave Africa a trade route to the Silk Road and served simultaneously as a port for incoming ships. There is evidence that Bantu or Swahili sailors or traders may have begun sailing to the western shores of Madagascar as early as around the 6th and 7th century.

According to the traditions of some Malagasy peoples, the first Bantus and Arabs to settle in Madagascar came as refugees from the civil wars that followed the death of Muhammad in 632.
Beginning in the 10th or 11th century, Arabic and Zanzibari slavers worked their way down the Swahili coast in their dhows and established settlements on the west coast of Madagascar. Notably they included the Zafiraminia, traditional ancestors of the Antemoro, Antanosy and other east coast ethnicities. The last wave of Arab immigrants, the Antalaotra, immigrated from Swahili colonies. They settled the northwest of the island (the Mahajanga area) and introduced, for the first time, Islam to Madagascar.

Arab immigrants, though few in number compared to the native Austronesians and Bantus, nevertheless left a lasting impression. The Malagasy names for seasons, months, days, and coins in certain regions come from Arabic origins, as do cultural features such as the practice of circumcision, the communal grain-pool, and different forms of salutation (such as &quot;salama&quot;).

===Neo-Austronesians: Malays, Javanese, Bugis, and Orang Laut (from the 8th century)===
According to oral tradition, new Austronesian clans (Malays, Javanese, Bugis, and Orang Laut), historically referred to in general, regardless of their native island, as the &quot;Hova&quot; (from Old Bugis &quot;uwa&quot;, &quot;commoner&quot;) landed in the north-west and east coast of the island. Adelaar&#x27;s observations of Old Malay (Sanskritised), Old Javanese (Sanskritised) and Old Bugis borrowings in the initial Proto-Southeast-Barito language indicate that the first Hova waves came probably in the 7th century at the earliest. Marre and Dahl pointed out that the number of Sanskrit words in Malagasy is very limited compared with the large number now found in Indonesian languages, which means that the Indonesian settlers must have come at an early stage of Hindu influence, that is ca. 400 AD.

The Hova were probably derived from Indonesian thalassocracies. Their leaders were known as the &quot;diana&quot; in the Southeast and &quot;andriana&quot; or &quot;raondriana&quot; in the Center and the West (from &quot;(ra)-hadi-an&quot;, &quot;lord&quot; or &quot;master&quot; in Old Javanese, modern Javanese &quot;raden&quot;, also found in the Bugis noble title &quot;andi&quot; and the Tagalog word for &quot;king&quot; &quot;hari&quot;). They for the most part allied with Vazimba clans:
* In the Northwest area of the current Ankoala (from &quot;kuala&quot;, &quot;estuary&quot; in Malay and Indonesian) where the Hova &quot;Orang Laut&quot; (&quot;Antalaotra&quot; in Malagasy) had probably established their base for their Indian Ocean operations.
* On the east coast (Betsimisaraka) where the Hova leaders were also called &quot;Filo (ha) be&quot; by the &quot;neo-Vezo&quot; clans.
* In the southeast where the leaders (&quot;Diana&quot;) of the Zafiraminia and Zafikazimambo clans allied with the &quot;neo-Vezo&quot; and founded the later Antaisaka, Antaimoro and Antambahoaka kingdoms.
* In the west: the Maroserana dynasty which founded the Sakalava Kingdom is itself a result of Zafiraminia on the east coast.
* In the Center where repeated alliances among the Hova leaders (the &quot;andriana&quot;) (such as Andrianerinerina, Andriantomara and their descendants) with the chiefs of Vazimba clans (such as Rafandrana and his descendants) led to the Merina and Betsileo Kingdoms.

With the arrival of Islam, Persian and Arab traders soon supplanted the Indonesians on the coast of Africa and eventually extended their control over the Comoro Islands and parts of the coast of Madagascar. Meanwhile, with competition in the new joint naval powers of Song China and Chola South India, the thalassocracies of Indonesia were in rapid decline, though the Portuguese still encountered Javanese sailors in Madagascar in the sixteenth century.

===Bantus (from the 9th century)===
There is archaeological evidence that Bantu peoples, agro-pastoralists from East Africa, may have begun migrating to the island as early as the 6th and 7th century. Other historical and archaeological records suggest that some of the Bantus were descendants of Swahili sailors and merchants who used dhows to traverse the seas to the western shores of Madagascar. Finally some sources theorize that during the Middle Ages, Arab, Persian and Neo-Austronesian slave-traders brought Bantu people to Madagascar transported by Swahili merchants to feed foreign demand for slaves. Years of intermarriages created the Malagasy people, who primarily speak Malagasy, an Austronesian language with Bantu influences. There are consequently many (Proto-)Swahili borrowings in the initial Proto-SEB Malagasy language. This substratum is especially significantly present in the domestic and agricultural vocabulary (e.g. &quot;omby&quot; or &quot;aombe&quot;, &quot;beef&quot;, from Swahili &quot;ng&#x27;ombe&quot;; &quot;tongolo&quot; &quot;onion&quot; from Swahili &quot;kitunguu&quot;; Malagasy &quot;nongo&quot; &quot;pot&quot; from &quot;nunggu&quot; in Swahili).

===Europeans (from 1500)===
Europe knew of Madagascar through Arab sources; thus &quot;The Travels of Marco Polo&quot; claimed that &quot;the inhabitants are Saracens, or followers of the law of Mohammed&quot;, without mentioning other inhabitants. Other than its size and location, everything about the island in the book describes southeastern Africa, not Madagascar. European contact began on 10 August 1500, when the Portuguese sea captain Diogo Dias sighted the island after his ship separated from a fleet going to India. The Portuguese traded with the islanders and named the island &quot;São Lourenço&quot; (Saint Lawrence). In 1666, François Caron, the director general of the newly formed French East India Company, sailed to Madagascar. The company failed to establish a colony on Madagascar but established ports on the nearby islands of Bourbon (now Réunion) and Isle de France (now Mauritius). In the late 17th century, the French established trading posts along the east coast. On Île Sainte-Marie, a small island off the northeastern coast of Madagascar, Captain Misson and his pirate crew allegedly founded the famous pirate utopia of Libertatia in the late 17th century. From about 1774 to 1824, Madagascar was a favourite haunt for pirates. Many European sailors were shipwrecked on the coasts of the island, among them Robert Drury, whose journal is one of the few written depictions of life in southern Madagascar during the 18th century. Sailors sometimes called Madagascar &quot;Island of the Moon&quot;.

====European settlements====
By the 15th century, Europeans had wrested control of the spice trade from the Muslims. They did this by bypassing the Middle East and sending their cargo-ships around the Cape of Good Hope to India. The Portuguese mariner Diogo Dias became the first European to set foot on Madagascar when his ship, bound for India, blew off course in 1500. In the ensuing 200 years, the English and French tried (and failed) to establish settlements on the island.

Fever, dysentery, hostile Malagasy, and the trying arid climate of southern Madagascar soon terminated the English settlement near Toliara in 1646. Another English settlement in the north in Île Sainte-Marie came to an end in 1649. The French colony at Tôlanaro (Fort Dauphin) fared a little better: it lasted thirty years. On Christmas night 1672, local Antanosy tribesmen, perhaps angry because fourteen French soldiers in the fort had recently divorced their Malagasy wives to marry fourteen French orphan-women sent out to the colony, massacred the fourteen grooms and thirteen of the fourteen brides. The Antanosy then besieged the stockade at Tôlanaro for eighteen months. A ship of the French East India Company rescued the surviving thirty men and one widow in 1674.

In 1665, François Caron, the Director General of the newly formed French East India Company, sailed to Madagascar. The Company failed to found a colony on Madagascar but established ports on the nearby islands of Bourbon and Île-de-France (today&#x27;s Réunion and Mauritius respectively). In the late 17th century, the French established trading-posts along the east coast.

====Pirates and slave-traders====
Between 1680 and 1725, Madagascar became a pirate stronghold. Many unfortunate sailors became shipwrecked and stranded on the island. Those who survived settled down with the natives, or more often, found French or English colonies on the island or even pirate havens and thus became pirates themselves. One such case, that of Robert Drury,
resulted in a journal giving one of the few written depictions of southern Madagascar in the 18th century.

Notable pirates including William Kidd, Henry Every, John Bowen, and Thomas Tew made Antongil Bay and Île Sainte-Marie (a small island 12 miles off the northeast coast of Madagascar) their bases of operations. The pirates plundered merchant ships in the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf. They deprived Europe-bound ships of their silks, cloth, spices, and jewels. Vessels captured going in the opposite direction (to India) lost their coin, gold, and silver. The pirates robbed the Indian cargo ships that traded between ports in the Indian Ocean as well as ships commissioned by the East India Companies of France, England, and the Netherlands. The pilgrim fleet sailing between Surat in India and Mocha on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula were a favorite target, because the wealthy Muslim pilgrims often carried jewels and other finery with them to Mecca. Merchants in India, various ports of Africa, and Réunion showed willingness to fence the pirates&#x27; stolen goods. The low-paid seamen who manned merchant ships in the Indian Ocean hardly put up a fight, seeing as they had little reason or motivation to risk their lives. The pirates often recruited crewmen from the ships they plundered.

With regard to piracy in Malagasy waters, note the (semi-)legendary accounts of the alleged pirate-state of Libertalia.

Prior to the arrival of the Europeans, certain Malagasy tribes occasionally waged wars to capture and enslave prisoners. They either sold the slaves to Arab traders or kept them on-hand as laborers. Following the arrival of European slavers, human slaves became more valuable, and the coastal tribes of Madagascar took to warring with each other to obtain prisoners for the lucrative slave-trade. Instead of spears and cutlasses, the tribesmen fought with muskets, musket-balls, and gunpowder that they obtained from the Europeans, conducting fierce and brutal wars. On account of their relationship to the pirates, the Betsimisaraka in eastern Madagascar had more firearms than anyone else. They overpowered their neighbors, the Antankarana and Tsimihety, and even raided the Comoro Islands. As the tribe on the west coast with the most connections to the slave trade, the Sakalava people also had access to guns and powder.

Today, the people of Madagascar can be considered as the product of mixing between the first occupants, the &quot;vahoaka ntaolo&quot; Austronesians (&quot;Vazimba&quot; and &quot;Vezo&quot;) and those arrived later (&quot;Hova&quot; neo-Austronesians, Persians, Arabs, Africans and Europeans).

Genotypically, the original Austronesian heritage is more or less evenly distributed throughout the island. Researchers have noticed the &quot;Polynesian motif&quot; everywhere: an old marker of Austronesian populations from before the great immigration to the islands of Polynesia and Melanesia. This fact would require a starting common home among the Proto-Malagasy &quot;vahoaka ntaolo&quot; (gone west to Madagascar) and the ancestors of the current Polynesians (left for the Pacific Islands in the East) between 500 BCE – 1 CE.

== Feudal era (1500–1895) ==

===Rise of the great kingdoms===
Those new immigrants of the Middle Ages were a minority in numbers, yet their cultural contributions, political and technological to the neo-Vazimba and neo-Vezo world substantially altered their society and is the cause of the major upheavals of the sixteenth century that led to the Malagasy feudal era.

On the coasts, the integration of the East Asians, Middle Easterns, Bantus and Portuguese led to the establishment of the kingdoms of the Antakarana, Boina, Menabe and Vezo on the west coast, the Mahafaly and Antandroy in the south, and the Antesaka, Antambahoaka, Antemoro, Antanala and Betsimisaraka on the east coast.

In the interior, the struggle for hegemony between the different Neo-Vazimba clans of central highlands, called the &quot;Hova&quot; by the coastal Neo-Vezo clans, led to the creation of the Merina, Betsileo, Bezanozano, Sihanaka, Tsimihety and Bara kingdoms.

The birth of these kingdoms/tribes essentially altered the political structure of the ancient world of the Vahoaka Ntaolo, but for the most part the common language, customs, traditions, religion and economy was preserved.

Among the Central Kingdoms, the most important were the Betsileo kingdoms (Fandriana, Fisakana, Manandriana, Isandra) to the south, and the Merina kingdoms to the north. These were definitively unified in the early 19th century by Andrianampoinimerina. His son and successor Radama I (reigning 1810–1828) opened his country to foreign influence. With the support of the British, he extended its authority over much of the island. From 1817, the central Merina kingdoms, Betsileo, Bezanozano, and Sihanaka, unified by Radama I were known to the outside world as the Kingdom of Madagascar.

===Sakalava===
The island&#x27;s West clan chiefs began to extend their power through trade with their Indian Ocean neighbors, first with Arab, Persian and Somali traders who connected Madagascar with East Africa, the Middle East and India, and later with European slave traders. The wealth created in Madagascar through trade created a state system ruled by powerful regional monarchs known as the Maroserana. These monarchs adopted the cultural traditions of subjects in their territories and expanded their kingdoms. They took on divine status, and new nobility and artisan classes were created. Madagascar functioned as a contact port for the other Swahili seaport city-states such as Sofala, Kilwa, Mombasa and Zanzibar. By the Middle Ages, large chiefdoms began to dominate considerable areas of the island. Among these were the Betsimisaraka alliance of the eastern coast and the Sakalava chiefdoms of the Menabe (centered in what is now the town of Morondava) and of Boina (centered in what is now the provincial capital of Mahajanga). The influence of the Sakalava extended across what are now the provinces of Antsiranana, Mahajanga and Toliara.

The island&#x27;s chiefs began to extend their power through trade with their Indian Ocean neighbours, notably East Africa, the Middle East and India. Large chiefdoms began to dominate considerable areas of the island. Among these were the Sakalava chiefdoms of the Menabe, centred in what is now the town of Morondava, and of Boina, centered in what is now the provincial capital of Mahajanga (Majunga). The influence of the Sakalava extended across what are now the provinces of Antsiranana, Mahajanga and Toliara.

According to local tradition, the founders of the Sakalava kingdom were Maroseraña (or Maroseranana, &quot;those who owned many ports&quot;) princes, from the Fiherenana (now Toliara). They quickly subdued the neighbouring princes, starting with the southern ones, in the Mahafaly area. The true founder of Sakalava dominance was Andriamisara; his son Andriandahifotsy (c. 1610–1658) then extended his authority northwards, past the Mangoky River. His two sons, Andriamanetiarivo and Andriamandisoarivo, extended gains further up to the Tsongay region (now Mahajanga). At about that time, the empire&#x27;s unity starts to split, resulting in a southern kingdom (Menabe) and a northern kingdom (Boina). Further splits resulted, despite continued extension of the Boina princes&#x27; reach into the extreme north, in Antankarana country.

The Sakalava rulers of this period are known through the memoirs of Europeans such as Robert Drury, James Cook, Barnvelt (1719), Valentyn (1726).

===Merina monarchy===

King Andrianampoinimerina (1785–1810) and his son, Radama I (1810–1828) succeeded in uniting nearly all of Madagascar under Merina rule. These kings and their successors descended from a line of ancient Merina royalty who ruled the lands of Imerina in the central Highlands of Madagascar since at least the 16th century. Even prior to their eventual domination and unification of the entire island, the political and cultural activities of Merina royalty were to leave an indelible mark on contemporary Malagasy identity.

With the establishment of dominion over the greater part of the Highlands, Andrianampoinimerina became the first Merina monarch to be considered a king of Madagascar. The island continued to be ruled by a succession of Merina monarchs until the last of them, Ranavalona III, was deposed and exiled to Algeria by French forces who conquered and colonized the island in 1895.

====King Andrianampoinimerina====

Andrianampoinimerina, grandson of King Andriambelomasina and successor to his uncle King Andrianjafy, successfully reunited the fragmented Merina kingdom through a combination of diplomacy, strategic political marriages and successful military campaigns against rival princes. Andrianampoinimerina distinguished himself from other kings by codifying laws and supervising the building of dikes and trenches to increase the amount of arable land around his capital at Antananarivo in a successful bid to end the famines that had wracked Imerina for decades. The king ambitiously proclaimed: &quot;Ny ranomasina no valapariako&quot; (“the sea is the boundary of my rice-field”), and by the time of his death in 1810 he had conquered the Bara and Betsileo highland tribes, laying the groundwork for expansion of his kingdom to the shores of the island.

====King Radama I (1810–1828)====

Andrianampoinimerina&#x27;s son Radama I (Radama the Great) assumed the throne during a turning-point in European history that had repercussions for Madagascar. With the defeat of Napoléon in 1814/1815, the balance of power in Europe and overseas shifted in Britain&#x27;s favor. The British, eager to exert control over the trade routes of the Indian Ocean, had captured the islands of Réunion and Mauritius from the French in 1810. Although they returned Réunion to France, they kept Mauritius as a naval base which would maintain trade links throughout the British Empire. Mauritius&#x27;s governor, in a bid to woo Madagascar from French control, recognized Radama I as King of Madagascar, a diplomatic maneuver meant to underscore the idea of the sovereignty of the island and thus to preclude claims by any European powers.

Radama I signed treaties with the United Kingdom outlawing the slave trade and admitting Protestant missionaries into Madagascar. As a result of these treaties Protestant missionaries from Britain would spread British influence in Madagascar; while outlawing the slave trade would weaken Réunion&#x27;s economy by depriving the island of slave laborers for France&#x27;s sugar plantations. In return for outlawing the slave trade, Madagascar received what the treaty called &quot;The Equivalent&quot;: an annual sum of a thousand dollars in gold, another thousand in silver, stated amounts of gunpowder, flints, and muskets, plus 400 surplus British Army uniforms. The governor of Mauritius also sent military advisers who accompanied and sometimes led Merina soldiers in their battles against the Sakalava and Betsimisaraka. In 1824, having defeated the Betsimisaraka, Radama I declared, &quot;Today, the whole island is mine! Madagascar has but one master.&quot; The king died in 1828 while leading his army on a punitive expedition against the Betsimisaraka.

====Queen Ranavalona I (1828–1861)====
The 33-year reign of Queen Ranavalona I, the widow of Radama I, was characterized by an increase in the size of the Kingdom of Madagascar as it conquered neighboring states as well as an effort to maintain the cultural and political sovereignty of Madagascar in the face of increasing foreign influence. The queen repudiated the treaties that Radama I had signed with Britain and, in 1835 after issuing a royal edict prohibiting the practice of Christianity in Madagascar, she expelled British missionaries from the island and began persecuting Christian converts who would not renounce their religion. Malagasy Christians would remember this period as &quot;ny tany maizina&quot;, or &quot;the time when the land was dark&quot;.

During her reign, constant warfare, disease, slave labor, and harsh measures of justice resulted in a high mortality rate among the Malagasy population; the population of the island is estimated to have declined by half from 5 million to 2.5 million between 1833 and 1839.

Unbeknownst to the queen, her son and heir, the crown-prince (the future Radama II), attended Roman Catholic masses in secret. The young man grew up under the influence of French nationals in Antananarivo. In 1854, he wrote a letter to Napoléon III inviting France to invade and uplift Madagascar. On 28 June 1855 he signed the Lambert Charter. This document gave Joseph-François Lambert, an enterprising French businessman who had arrived in Madagascar only three weeks before, the exclusive right to develop all minerals, forests, and unoccupied land in Madagascar in exchange for a 10-percent royalty payable to the Merina monarchy. In years to come, the French would show the Lambert Charter and the prince&#x27;s letter to Napoléon III to explain the Franco-Hova Wars and the annexation of Madagascar as a colony. In 1857, the queen uncovered a plot by her son (the future Radama II) and French nationals in the capital to remove her from power. She immediately expelled all foreigners from Madagascar, sparing her son. Ranavalona died in 1861.

==== King Radama II (1861–1863) ====

In his brief two years on the throne, King Radama II re-opened trade with Mauritius and Réunion, invited Christian missionaries and foreigners to return to Madagascar, and re-instated most of Radama I&#x27;s reforms. His liberal policies angered the aristocracy, however, and Rainivoninahitriniony, the prime minister, engineered a coup d&#x27;état in which Radama II was strangled to death.

====Queen Rasoherina (1863–1868)====

 A council of princes headed by Rainilaiarivony approached Rabodo, the widow of Radama II, the day after the death of her husband. They gave her the conditions under which she could succeed to the throne. These conditions included the suppression of trial by ordeal as well as the monarchy&#x27;s defense of freedom of religion. Rabodo, crowned queen on 13 May 1863 under the throne name of Rasoherina, reigned until her death on 1 April 1868.

The Malagasy people remember Queen Rasoherina for sending ambassadors to London and Paris and for prohibiting Sunday markets. On 30 June 1865, she signed a treaty with the United Kingdom giving British citizens the right to rent land and property on the island and to have a resident ambassador. With the United States of America she signed a trade agreement that also limited the importation of weapons and the export of cattle. Finally, with France the queen signed a peace between her descendants and the descendants of the &quot;Emperor of France&quot;. Rasoherina married her prime minister, Rainivoninahitriniony, but public outcry against his involvement in the murder of Radama II soon forced his resignation and exile to Betsileo country south of Imerina. She then married his brother, Rainilaiarivony, head of the army at the time of Radama II&#x27;s murder who was promoted to the post of Prime Minister upon the resignation and exile of his older brother. Rainilaiarivony would rule Madagascar from behind the scenes for the remaining 32 years of the Merina monarchy, marrying each of the final three queens of Madagascar in succession.

====Queen Ranavalona II (1868–1883)====

In 1869, Queen Ranavalona II, previously educated by the London Missionary Society, underwent baptism into the Church of England and subsequently made the Anglican faith the official state religion of Madagascar.
The queen had all the &quot;sampy&quot; (traditional royal idols) burned in a public display. Catholic and Protestant missionaries arrived in numbers to build churches and schools. The reign of Queen Ranavalona II proved the high water mark of British influence in Madagascar. British goods and weapons arrived on the island by way of South Africa.

====Queen Ranavalona III (1883–1897)====

Her public coronation as queen took place on 22 November 1883 and she took the name Ranavalona III. As her first order of business she confirmed the nomination of Rainilaiarivony and his entourage in their positions. She also promised to do away with the French threat.

====End of the monarchy====
Angry at the cancellation of the Lambert Charter and seeking to restore property seized from French citizens, France invaded Madagascar in 1883 in what became known as the first Franco-Hova War (&quot;Hova&quot; as a name referring to the Merina aristocrats). At the war&#x27;s end, Madagascar ceded Antsiranana (Diégo Suarez) on the northern coast to France and paid 560,000 gold francs to the heirs of Joseph-François Lambert. In Europe, meanwhile, European diplomats had worked out an agreement whereby Britain, in order to establish control over the Sultanate of Zanzibar, ceded its rights over the island of Heligoland to Germany and renounced all claims of influence in Madagascar in favor of France. The agreement spelled the end of the Madagascan political independence. Rainilaiarivony had succeeded in playing the various European powers against one another, but now France could act without fear of British support towards the Madagascans.

In 1895, a French flying column landed in Mahajanga (Majunga) and marched by way of the Betsiboka River to the capital, Antananarivo, taking the city&#x27;s defenders by surprise (they had expected an attack from the much closer east coast). Twenty French soldiers died fighting and 6,000 died of malaria and other diseases before the second Franco-Hova War ended. In 1896 the French Parliament voted to annex Madagascar. The 103-year-old Merina monarchy ended with the royal family sent into exile in Algeria.

===International recognition and modernization of the Kingdom (1817–1895)===
The kingdom of Madagascar continued its transformation throughout the 19th century from a locally grown monarchy into a modern state.

Before Radama I the Malagasy language was written in a script known as sorabe. In 1820 under the direction of David Jones, a Welsh missionary of the London Missionary Society, Radama I codified the new Malagasy Latin alphabet of 21 letters which replaced the old sorabe alphabet. By 1830 the Bible was the first book written in this new Malagasy Latin alphabet. It is the oldest complete translation of the bible into a sub-Saharan African language.

The United States and the Kingdom of Madagascar concluded a commercial convention in 1867 after which Queen Rasoherina and Prime Minister Rainilaiarivoy exchanged gifts with president Andrew Johnson. A treaty of peace, friendship, and commerce was then signed in 1881.

During the reign of Ranavalona I, early attempts at industrialization took place from 1835 under the direction of the French Jean Laborde (a survivor of a shipwreck off the east coast), producing soap, porcelain, metal tools and firearms (rifles, cannons, etc.)..

In 1864 Antananarivo opened the first hospital and a modern medical school. Two years later appeared the first newspaper. A scientific journal in English (&quot;Antananarivo Annual&quot;) was released from 1875. In 1894, on the eve of the establishment of colonial rule, the schools of the kingdom, mainly led by the Protestant missions, were attended by over 200,000 students.

==French colonization==
In 1750, the ruler of the Kingdom of Betsimisaraka, Bety of Betsimisaraka, ceded the island Nosy Boraha (Île Sainte-Marie) to the Kingdom of France. However, in 1752 the French Colonists were massacred when the local population rebelled. France left the settlement abandoned for roughly half a century until returning in 1818.

In 1840 Tsiomeko, the ruler of Nosy Be island, accepted French protection in 1840. The French took possession of the island in 1841, and in 1849 an unsuccessful attempt was made to expel them.

In the Berlin Treaty, the British accepted the claims of France to exert its influence on Madagascar, and after the first Franco-Hova Wara treaty of alliance between France and Madagascar was signed on 17 December 1885 by Queen Ranavalona III, granting France a protectorate over the Diego-Suarez bay and surrounding territory, as well as the islands of Nosy-Be and Île Sainte-Marie.

Disagreements on the implementation of this treaty served as a pretext for the French invasion of 1895, which first met little resistance. The authority of the prime minister Rainilaiarivony, in power since 1864, had become very unpopular with the public.

The British accepted the imposition of a French protectorate over Madagascar in 1890 in return for recognition of British sovereignty over Zanzibar (subsequently part of Tanzania) and as part of an overall definition of spheres of influence in the area. The intention of the French was initially to maintain the protectorate in order to control the economy and foreign relations of the island. But later, the outbreak of the Menalamba rebellion and the arrival of General Gallieni (responsible for &quot;pacifying&quot; the country) in 1896 led to the colonization of the island and the exile of the queen to Algeria.

In 1904–1905 Madagascar was the scene of a large-scale uprising by various tribes and tribal leaders, among whom Kotavy, a former French corporal who defected to the rebels, filled a preponderant role.

Malagasy troops fought in France, Morocco, and Syria during World War II. Prior to the implementation of the Final Solution, Nazi Germany had considered the Madagascar Plan, which would have relocated European Jews to Madagascar. After France fell to the Germans in 1940, the Vichy government administered Madagascar until 1942, when British and Commonwealth troops occupied the strategic island in the Battle of Madagascar. The United Kingdom handed over control of the island to Free French Forces in 1943.

== Revolt and decolonization (1947–1960) ==
In 1948, with French prestige at a low ebb, the French government, headed by Prime Minister Paul Ramadier of the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO) party, suppressed the Madagascar revolt, a nationalist uprising.

The French subsequently established reformed institutions in 1956 under the Loi Cadre (Overseas Reform Act), and Madagascar moved peacefully toward independence. The Malagasy Republic, proclaimed on 14 October 1958, became an autonomous state within the French Community. On 26 March 1960 France agreed to Madagascar becoming fully independent. On 26 June 1960 Madagascar became an independent country and Philibert Tsiranana became its first president.

== Independence ==
===First Republic (1960–1972)===
Tsiranana&#x27;s rule represented continuation, with French settlers (or &quot;colons&quot;) still in positions of power. Unlike many of France&#x27;s former colonies, the Malagasy Republic strongly resisted movements towards communism.

In 1972, protests against these policies came to a head and Tsiranana had to step down. He handed power to General Gabriel Ramanantsoa of the army and his provisional government. This régime reversed previous policy in favour of closer ties with the Soviet Union.

On 5 February 1975, Colonel Richard Ratsimandrava became the President of Madagascar. After six days as head of the country, he died in an assassination while driving from the presidential palace to his home. Political power passed to Gilles Andriamahazo.

===Second Republic (1972–1991)===
On 15 June 1975, Lieutenant-Commander Didier Ratsiraka (who had previously served as foreign minister) came to power in a coup. Elected president for a seven-year term, Ratsiraka moved further towards socialism, nationalising much of the economy and cutting all ties with France. These policies hastened the decline in the Madagascan economy that had begun after independence as French immigrants left the country, leaving a shortage of skills and technology behind. Ratsiraka&#x27;s original seven-year term as president continued after his party (Avant-garde de la Révolution Malgache or AREMA) became the only legal party in the 1977 elections.

In the 1980s, Madagascar moved back towards France, abandoning many of its communist-inspired policies in favour of a market economy, though Ratsiraka still kept hold of power.

Eventually, opposition, both within and without, forced Ratsiraka to consider his position and in 1992 the country adopted a new and democratic constitution.

===Third Republic (1991–2002)===
The first multi-party elections came in 1993, with Albert Zafy defeating Ratsiraka. Despite being a strong proponent of a liberal, free-market economy, Zafy ran on a ticket critical of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. During his presidency the country struggled to implement IMF and World Bank guidelines that were, on the short term, suicidal politically.

As president Zafy was frustrated by the restraints placed upon the powers of his office by the new constitution. His quest for increased executive power put him on a collision course with the parliament led by then prime minister Francisque Ravony. Zafy eventually won the power he sought after but suffered impeachment at the hands of the disenfranchised parliament in 1996 for violating the constitution by refusing to promulgate specific laws.

The ensuing elections saw a turnout of less than 50% and unexpectedly resulted in the re-election of Didier Ratsiraka.
He moved further towards capitalism. The influence of the IMF and the World Bank led to widespread privatisation.

Opposition to Ratsiraka began to grow again. Opposition parties boycotted provincial elections in 2000, and the 2001 presidential election produced more controversy. The opposition candidate Marc Ravalomanana claimed victory after the first round (in December) but the incumbent rejected this position. In early 2002 supporters of the two sides took to the streets and violent clashes took place. Ravalomanana claimed that fraud had occurred in the polls. After an April recount the High Constitutional Court declared Ravalomanana president. Ratsiraka continued to dispute the result but his opponent gained international recognition, and Ratsiraka had to go into exile in France, though forces loyal to him continued activities in Madagascar.

===Post-Ratsiraka===
Ravalomanana&#x27;s Tiako I Madagasikara party achieved overwhelming electoral success in December 2001 and he survived an attempted coup in January 2003. He used his mandate to work closely with the IMF and the World Bank to reform the economy, to end corruption and to realise the country&#x27;s potential.
Ratsiraka went on trial (&quot;in absentia&quot;) for embezzlement (the authorities charged him with taking $8m of public money with him into exile) and the court sentenced him to ten years&#x27; hard labour.

Ravalomanana is credited with improving the country&#x27;s infrastructure, such as roads, along with making improvements in education and health, but has faced criticism for his lack of progress against poverty; purchasing power is said to have declined during his time in office. On 18 November 2006, his plane was forced to divert from Madagascar&#x27;s capital during a return trip from Europe following reports of a coup underway in Antananarivo and shooting near the airport; however, this alleged coup attempt was unsuccessful.

Ravalomanana ran for a second term in the presidential election held on December 3, 2006. According to official results, he won the election with 54.79% of the vote in the first round; his best results were in Antananarivo Province, where he received the support of 75.39% of voters. He was sworn in for his second term on January 19, 2007.

Ravalomanana dissolved the National Assembly in July 2007, prior to the end of its term, following a constitutional referendum earlier in the year. Ravalomanana said that a new election needed to be held so that the National Assembly would reflect the changes made in this referendum.

He became involved in a political standoff after he closed the TV station belonging to Antananarivo mayor Andry Rajoelina. In January 2009, protests which then turned violent were organized and spearheaded by Andry Rajoelina, the mayor of the capital city of Antananarivo and a prominent opponent of President Ravalomanana.

The situation fundamentally changed on 10 March 2009 when army leaders forced the recently appointed defense secretary to resign (the previous one had decided to resign after the killings by the presidential guard on 7 February 2009). They also announced that they gave the opponents 72 hours to dialogue and find a solution to the crisis before they would take further action. This move came after the leaders of the main military camp had announced a day earlier that they would not execute orders coming from the presidency any more since their duty was to protect the people, and not to oppress them, as groups of the military had done over the last few days.

On 16 March 2009, the army seized the presidential palace in the centre of Antananarivo. Ravalomanana was not in the palace at the time. He handed his resignation to the army, which then decided to hand over power to his fierce political rival, Andry Rajoelina. The second round of the postponed presidential elections was held in December 2013 and the results were announced in January 2014. The winner and the next president was Hery Rajaonarimampianina. He was backed by Rajoelina who led the 2009 coup and still was very influential political figure.

In 2018 the first round of the presidential election was held on 7 November and the second round was held on 10 December. Three former presidents and the most recent president were the main candidates of the elections. Former president Andry Rajoelina won the second round of the elections. He was previously president from 2009 to 2014. Former president Marc Ravalomanana lost the second round and he did not accept the results because of allegations of fraud. Ravalomanana was president from 2002 to 2009. The most recent president Hery Rajaonarimampianina received very modest support in the first round. In January 2019 the High Constitutional Court declared Rajoelina as the winner of the elections and the new president.

In 2019, an epidemic of measles killed 1,200 people.

In 2021, Madagascar&#x27;s worst drought in 40 years left more than a million people in southern Madagascar food insecure. This forced thousands of people to leave their homes to search for food.

In November 2023, Andry Rajoelina was re-elected to another term with 58.95% of the vote in the first round of the election. Turnout was 46.36%, the lowest in a presidential election in the country&#x27;s history.

<text>Demographic features of the population of Madagascar include population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

Madagascar&#x27;s population is predominantly of mixed Austronesian and East-African origin.

Since the country&#x27;s independence in 1960, three general census of population and dwellings (RGPH) have been conducted by the national statistics office INSTAT under the supervision of the ministry of economy. The first census in 1975 counted 7.4 million Malagasy people, the second one in 1993 censused 12.3 million citizens and the 18h May to 10 June 2018 census numbered 25 674 186 inhabitants. 

==Population==
The problem with population estimation in Madagascar is that data is very old and limited. The last population census was carried out in 1993, after an initial 1975 census. There was an attempt at a census in 2009, but this attempt ultimately failed due to political instability. Therefore, the demographic situation is inferred but reliability of any estimates from any source has a large margin of error.
According to the total population was in , compared to only 4,084,000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 43.1%, 53.8% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 3.1% was 65 years or older.

==Ethnicity==

The island of Madagascar is predominantly populated by people broadly classified as belonging to the Malagasy ethno-linguistic group. This group is further subdivided a number of ethnic groups, often into the standard eighteen.
In addition, communities of Indians in Madagascar and Arabs and Somalis have long been established on the island and have assimilated into local communities to varying degrees, in some places having long since become identified &quot;Malagasy&quot; ethnic groups, and in others maintaining distinct identities and cultural separation. More recent arrivals include Europeans and Chinese immigrants.

Madagascar was probably uninhabited prior to Austronesian settlement in the early centuries AD. Austronesian (particularly Malay) features are most predominant in the central highlands peoples, while coastal peoples are phenotypically more East African, sometimes with minor Arab, Somali, European and Indian admixtures. The largest coastal groups are the Betsimisaraka (1,500,000) and the Tsimihety and Sakalava (700,000 each). Malagasy society has long been polarized between the politically and economically advantaged highlanders of the central plateaux and the people along the coast. For example, in the 1970s there was widespread opposition among coastal ethnics against the policy of &quot;Malagasization&quot; which intended to phase out the use of the French language in public life in favour of a more prominent position for the Malagasy language, whose orthography is based on the Merina dialect. 

Indians in Madagascar descend mostly from traders who arrived in the newly independent nation looking for better opportunities. The majority of them came from the west coast of India known as Karana (Muslim) and Banian (Hindu). The majority speak Hindi or Gujarati, although some other Indian languages are also spoken. the younger generations speak at least three languages, including French, Gujarati and Malagasy. A large number of the Indians in Madagascar have a high level of education, particularly the younger generation.

A sizeable number of Europeans also reside in Madagascar, mostly of French descent.

==Languages==
Malagasy (official, and national language), French (official).

==Religion==

According to the 1993 national census, 41% of Malagasies practised Christianity and 52% practise traditional religion, which tends to emphasize links between the living and the &quot;razana&quot; (ancestors); by 2020, only 4.5% of Malagasies exclusively practised folk religions and 85% were Christian (according to the Pew Research Center). The Association of Religion Data Archives noted that in 2020, 58.1% of the population is Christian, 2.1% is Muslim and 39.2% practices traditional faiths, while 0.6% of the population is non-religious or adheres to other faiths.

Madagascar&#x27;s traditional religions tend to emphasize links between the living and the dead. They believe that the dead join their ancestors in the ranks of divinity and that ancestors are intensely concerned with the fate of their living descendants. This spiritual communion is celebrated by the Merina and Betsileo reburial practice of famadihana, or &quot;turning over the dead&quot;. In this ritual, relatives&#x27; remains are removed from the family tomb, rewrapped in new silk shrouds, and returned to the tomb following festive ceremonies in their honor. In the festivities, they eat, drink, and literally dance with the dead. After one or two days of celebrating, they shower the body with gifts and rebury it.
Malagasy Christians are roughly 50% Catholic and 50% Protestant (mainly Reformed Protestant Church of Jesus Christ in Madagascar (FJKM), Lutheran, and Anglican) or Roman Catholic, but there are also smaller groups such as members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Seventh-day Adventists, Eastern Orthodox Christians and evangelicals. Many incorporate the cult of the dead with their other religious beliefs and bless their dead at church before proceeding with the traditional burial rites. They also may invite a pastor to attend a famadihana. A historical rivalry exists between the predominantly Catholic masses, considered to be underprivileged, and the predominantly Protestant Merina aristocrats, who tend to prevail in the civil service, business, and professions.
Followers of Islam constitute approximately 3% of the population in 2022, according to the US Department of State; there are also small numbers of Hindus and Jews.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had more than 13,000 members in 42 congregations in Madagascar in 2013.

A small community started practicing Judaism in 2010, and formally converted in 2016 with the assistance of Kulanu, a nonprofit organization focusing on remote Jewish communities.

<text>Politics of Madagascar takes place in a framework of a semi-presidential representative democratic republic, with a pluralist multi-party system. The President of Madagascar is head of state and the Prime Minister of Madagascar is head of government. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the bicameral parliament, which is composed of the Senate and the National Assembly. The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.

==Political history==

Madagascar&#x27;s first President, Philibert Tsiranana, was elected when his Social Democratic Party gained power at independence in 1960 and was reelected without opposition in March 1972. However, he resigned only 2 months later in response to massive anti-government demonstrations. The unrest continued, and Tsiranana&#x27;s successor, Gen. Gabriel Ramanantsoa, resigned on February 5, 1975, handing over executive power to Lt. Col. Richard Ratsimandrava, who was assassinated 6 days later. A provisional military directorate then ruled until a new government was formed in June 1975, under Didier Ratsiraka.

During the 16 subsequent years of President Ratsiraka&#x27;s rule, Madagascar continued under a government committed to revolutionary socialism based on the 1975 Constitution establishing a highly centralized state. During this period a strategy of nationalization of private enterprises, centralization of the economy and &quot;Malgasization&quot; of the education system crippled the economy, leaving traces even today of a highly centralized economic system and a high level of illiteracy. National elections in 1982 and 1989 returned Ratsiraka for a second and third 7-year presidential term. For much of this period, only limited and restrained political opposition was tolerated, with no direct criticism of the president permitted in the press.

With an easing of restrictions on political expression, beginning in the late 1980s, the Ratsiraka regime came under increasing pressure to make fundamental changes. In response to a deteriorating economy, Ratsiraka relaxed socialist economic policies and instituted some liberal, private-sector reforms. These, along with political reforms like the elimination of press censorship in 1989 and the formation of more political parties in 1990, were insufficient to placate a growing opposition movement known as Hery Velona (&quot;Active Forces&quot;). A number of already existing political parties and their leaders, among them Albert Zafy and Manandafy Rakotonirina, anchored this movement which was especially strong in Antananarivo and the surrounding high plateau.

In response to largely peaceful mass demonstrations and crippling general strikes, Ratsiraka replaced his prime minister in August 1991 but suffered an irreparable setback soon thereafter when his troops fired on peaceful demonstrators marching on Iavoloha, the suburban presidential palace, killing more than 30.

In an increasingly weakened position, Ratsiraka acceded to negotiations on the formation of a transitional government. The resulting &quot;Panorama Convention&quot; of October 31, 1991, stripped Ratsiraka of nearly all of his powers, created interim institutions, and set an 18-month timetable for completing a transition to a new form of constitutional government. The High Constitutional Court was retained as the ultimate judicial arbiter of the process.

In March 1992, a widely representative National Forum organized by the FFKM (Malagasy Christian Council of Churches) drafted a new Constitution. Troops guarding the proceedings clashed with pro-Ratsiraka &quot;federalists&quot; who tried to disrupt the forum in protest of draft constitutional provisions preventing the incumbent president from running again. The text of the new Constitution was put to a nationwide referendum in August 1992 and approved by a wide margin, despite efforts by federalists to disrupt balloting in several coastal areas.

Presidential elections were held on November 25, 1992, after the High Constitutional Court had ruled, over Hery Velona objections, that Ratsiraka could become a candidate. Runoff elections were held in February 1993, and the leader of the Hery Velona movement, Albert Zafy, defeated Ratsiraka. Zafy was sworn in as President on March 27, 1993. After President Zafy&#x27;s impeachment by the National Assembly in 1996 and the short quasi-presidency of Norbert Ratsirahonana, the 1997 elections once again pitted Zafy and Ratsiraka, with Ratsiraka this time emerging victorious. A National Assembly dominated by members of President Ratsiraka&#x27;a political party AREMA subsequently passed the 1998 Constitution, which considerably strengthened the presidency.

In December 2001, a presidential election was held in which both major candidates claimed victory. The Ministry of the Interior declared incumbent Ratsiraka of the AREMA party victorious. Marc Ravalomanana contested the results and claimed victory. A political crisis followed in which Ratsiraka supporters cut major transport routes from the primary port city to the capital city, a stronghold of Ravalomanana support. Sporadic violence and considerable economic disruption continued until July 2002 when Ratsiraka and several of his prominent supporters fled to exile in France. In addition to political differences, ethnic differences played a role in the crisis and continue to play a role in politics. Ratsiraka is from the coastal Betsimisaraka tribe and Ravalomanana comes from the highland Merina tribe.

After the end of the 2002 political crisis, President Ravalomanana began many reform projects, forcefully advocating &quot;rapid and durable development&quot; and the launching of a battle against corruption. December 2002 legislative elections gave his newly formed TIM (Tiako-I-Madagasikara) (I Love Madagascar) Party a commanding majority in the National Assembly. November 2003 municipal elections were conducted freely, returning a majority of supporters of the president, but also significant numbers of independent and regional opposition figures.

Following the crisis of 2002, the President replaced provincial governors with appointed PDSs (Presidents des Delegations Speciales). Subsequent legislation established a structure of 22 regions to decentralize administration. In September 2004, the Government named 22 Regional Chiefs, reporting directly to the President, to implement its decentralization plans. Financing and specific powers for the regional administrations remain to be clarified.

After being re-elected in 2006, Ravalomanana&#x27;s government was dissolved in March 2009, in a militarily-backed uprising led by Andry Rajoelina. Rajoelina formed a High Transitional Authority of which he was the &#x27;Transitional Head of State&#x27;. So far he has held a referendum, in November 2010, to update the constitution. Despite an alleged coup during, this was approved, and new elections were scheduled to be held in July 2013.

The second round of the postponed presidential elections was held in December 2013 and the results were announced in January 2014. The winner and the next president was Hery Rajaonarimampianina. He was backed by Rajoelina who led the 2009 coup and still was very influential political figure.

In 2018 the first round of the presidential election was held on 7 November and the second round was held on 10 December. Three former presidents and the most recent president were the main candidates of the elections. Former president Andry Rajoelina won the second round of the elections. He was previously president from 2009 to 2014. Former president Marc Ravalomana lost the second round and he did not accept the results because of allegations of fraud. Ravalomana was president from 2002 to 2009. The most recent president Hery Rajaonarimampianina received very modest support in the first round. In January 2019 the High Constitutional Court declared Rajoelina as the winner of the elections and the new president. In June 2019 parliamentary elections the party of president Andry Rajoelina won absolute majority of the seats of the National Assembly. It received 84 seats and the supporters of former president Ravalomana got only 16 seats of 151 seats of the National Assembly. 51 seats of deputies were independent or represented small parties. President Rajoelina could rule as a strongman.

In November 2023, Andry Rajoelina was re-elected to another term with 58.95% of the vote in the first round of the election. Turnout was 46.36%, the lowest in a presidential election in the country&#x27;s history.

<doc id="50878" wikidata="Q1520353" url="?curid=50878" title="Economy of Madagascar">
<text>The economy of [[Madagascar]] is billion by gross domestic product as of 2020, being a market economy and is supported by an agricultural industry and emerging tourism, textile and mining industries. Malagasy agriculture produces tropical staple crops such as rice and cassava, as well as cash crops such as vanilla and coffee.

Malagasy exports from customs protocol in some areas, notably the United States and the European Union. These exemptions have supported the growth of the Malagasy textile industry. Despite natural resources and developing industries, the 2009 Malagasy political crisis—considered by the international community to be an illegal coup—deterred foreign investments in Madagascar and caused the Malagasy economy to decline. Foreign investments have resumed following the resumption of elections in early 2014. Madagascar is a least developed country according to United Nations.

Madagascar&#x27;s economy at 2024 is one of the fastest growing economies in the world.

== History ==
Over the years, successive French colonial and independence-era governments have sought to modernize Madagascar&#x27;s economy. The first modern land use projects were established by French settlers or Creole immigrants from the Mascarene Islands in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. They introduced cash crops such as coffee, sugarcane, vanilla, cloves, and sisal for export. They also built small-scale mines to exploit the island&#x27;s graphite, chromite, and uranium resources. To facilitate the processing and marketing of these commodities, the immigrants established a number of financial and commercial enterprises and built a small, modern railroad system. They then brought some Malagasy into this modern sector of the economy, either as wage laborers and sharecroppers on the foreign-owned plantations, or as low-level employees in the civil service or business enterprises. The foreign owners and managers, however, retained almost all of the benefits from these operations.

After independence the Philibert Tsiranana regime did little to change the French domination of the modern sector of the economy, despite increasing outrage at this continued economic dependence. This anger, together with growing concern over an unequal distribution of wealth that left the southern and western parts of the island in relative poverty, caused the ouster of Tsiranana in 1972 and a shift in economic policy. The new military regime led by Gabriel Ramanantsoa cut most ties with France and began to Malagachize the economy. Slow progress toward this goal, however, helped to precipitate the end of the Ramanantsoa regime in mid-1975. Only with the rise of Didier Ratsiraka to the presidency later that year did the takeover of formerly French-dominated enterprises begin in earnest.

Ratsiraka&#x27;s policy of &quot;revolution from above&quot; went beyond confiscating or buying out foreign firms and turning them over to Malagasy ownership; he intended to socialize the economy by nationalizing major enterprises. The state acquired majority or minority ownership in nearly all large financial, transportation, marketing, mining, and manufacturing enterprises. Firms left under private control were required to buy and sell at state-controlled prices, and the state closely monitored the repatriation of profits. In the rural sector, Ratsiraka aimed to establish local farming cooperatives. Almost as important as this institutional reform was the regime&#x27;s intention, announced in an economic plan for the 1978-80 period, to increase dramatically the level of government capital investment in all sectors of the economy in order to improve the availability of goods and services to all.

By the start of the 1980s, however, Ratsiraka&#x27;s attempt to fashion viable socialist institutions and to stimulate the economy through increased investment had failed to improve economic production and welfare. Economic growth throughout the 1970s had not kept pace with the expanding population. Despite the availability of significant agricultural and mineral resources, the economy was less productive than at the start of the decade when the average per capita income was already among the lowest in the world. The only apparent effect of the enhanced level of investment, which reached all-time highs in the 1978-80 period, was to put the country deeply in debt to foreign creditors and, therefore, pave the way for a series of structural adjustment agreements signed with the IMF and the World Bank during the 1980s and the early 1990s. Such agreements were necessary because as a 1993 World Bank study pointed out, between 1971 and 1991 the per capita income of Malagasy dropped 40 percent.

Eventually admitting that adoption of the socialist model of economic centralization and state control was a mistake, the Ratsiraka regime in 1980 initiated a return to a more classic liberal economic model that the Albert Zafy regime wholeheartedly adopted following its inauguration in 1993. The post-1980 Ratsiraka and Zafy regimes have overseen the privatization of parastatals, the disbanding of agricultural marketing boards, the ratification of more liberal investment codes favoring foreign investment, the privatization of the banking industry, diversification of traditional, primary-product exports, and greater investment in food production. The Zafy regime has made reinvigoration of the Malagasy economy its number-one priority.

As of 1994, the majority of Malagasy continued to earn their livelihoods in ways fundamentally unchanged from those of their ancestors — small-scale farms supporting traditional irrigated rice cultivation, dryland farming of cassava and other foods, zebu cattle herding, or the raising of cash crops.

==Agriculture==
Madagascar produced, in 2018:

* 4 million tons of rice;
* 3.1 million tons of sugarcane;
* 2.5 million tons of cassava;
* 1 million tons of sweet potato;
* 388 thousand tons of vegetable;
* 383 thousand tons of banana;
* 300 thousand tons of mango (including mangosteen and guava);
* 257 thousand tons of potato;
* 230 thousand tons of taro;
* 215 thousand tons of maize;
* 93 thousand tons of pineapple;
* 86 thousand tons of beans;
* 83 thousand tons of orange;
* 73 thousand tons of coconut;

In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products, like coffee (57 thousand tons), clove (23 thousand tons), cocoa (11 thousand tons), cashew (7 thousand tons) and vanilla (3 thousand tons).

Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is Madagascar&#x27;s largest industry and employs 82% of its labor force. Madagascar&#x27;s varied climate, ranging from tropical along the coasts, moderate in the highlands and arid in the south, allows for the cultivation of tropical crops such as rice, cassava, beans and bananas. In 2011, agricultural products—especially cloves, vanilla, cacao, sugar, pepper, and coffee—accounted for Madagascar&#x27;s top twelve exports by value. Madagascar produces the largest vanilla harvest in the world and Malagasy vanilla accounts for 80-85% of the global vanilla market.

===Fishing===
The fishing industry is present with 66 industrial fishing vessels. Fees &amp; taxes for fishing licences are estimated at 3,6 billion Ariary (US$80 million) for 2023.

==Textiles==
Exports from Madagascar&#x27;s Export Processing Zones, located around Antananarivo and Antsirabe, account for the majority of garment exports and are largely exempt from customs restrictions in the United States under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and in the European Union under the Everything but Arms (EBA) agreement. 

==Mining==

A small but growing part of the economy is based on mining of ilmenite, with investments emerging in recent years, particularly near Tulear and Fort Dauphin. Mining corporation Rio Tinto Group started production at its Fort Dauphin Mandena mine in January 2009, following several years of preparation. The mining project is highly controversial, with Friends of the Earth and other environmental organizations filing reports to detail their concerns about the mine&#x27;s effect on the environment and local communities. Gemstone mining is also an important part of Madagascar&#x27;s economy.

Several major projects are underway in the mining and oil and gas sectors that, if successful, will give a significant boost. In the mining sector, these include the development of coal at Sakoa and nickel near Tamatave. The Ambatovy mine (nickel &amp; cobalt - Sherrit International 40%, Sumitomo 27.5%, Korea Resources 27.5%, SNC-Lavalin 5%) is a huge operation and has cost US$4.76 million to date and is due to start production in 2011. In oil, Madagascar Oil is developing the massive onshore heavy oil field at Tsimiroro and ultra heavy oil field at Bemolanga.
==Investment climate==


Following the 2002 political crisis, the government attempted to set a new course and build confidence, in coordination with international financial institutions and donors. Madagascar developed a recovery plan in collaboration with the private sector and donors and presented it at a &quot;Friends of Madagascar&quot; conference organized by the World Bank in Paris in July 2002. Donor countries demonstrated their confidence in the new government by pledging $1 billion in assistance over five years. The Malagasy Government identified road infrastructure as its principal priority and underlined its commitment to public-private partnership by establishing a joint public-private sector steering committee.

The Madagascar-U.S. Business Council was formed as a collaboration between the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Malagasian artisan producers in Madagascar in 2002. The U.S.-Madagascar Business Council was formed in the United States in May 2003, and the two organisations continue to explore ways to work for the benefit of both groups.

The government of former President Marc Ravalomanana was aggressively seeking foreign investment and had planned to tackle many of the obstacles to such investment, including combating corruption, reforming land-ownership laws, encouraging study of American and European business techniques, and active pursuit of foreign investors. President Ravalomanana rose to prominence through his agro-foods TIKO company, and is known for attempting to apply many of the lessons learned in the world of business to running the government. Prior to Ravalomanana&#x27;s resignation, concerns had arisen about the conflict of interest between his policies and the activities of his firms. Most notable among them the preferential treatment for rice imports initiated by the government in late 2004 when responding to a production shortfall in the country.

Madagascar&#x27;s appeal to investors stems from its competitive, trainable work force. More than 200 investors, particularly garment manufacturers, were organized under the country&#x27;s export processing zone (EPZ) system since it was established in 1989. The absence of quota limits on textile imports to the European market under the Lomé Convention helped stimulate this growth.

Growth in output in 1992–97 averaged less than the growth rate of the population. Growth has been taken away by a decline in world coffee demand, and the erratic commitment of the government to economic reform.
During a period of solid growth from 1997 to 2001, poverty levels remained stubbornly high, especially in rural areas. A six-month political crisis triggered by a dispute over the outcome of the presidential elections held in December 2001 virtually halted economic activity in much of the country in the first half of 2002. Real GDP dropped 12.7% in 2002, inflows of foreign investment dropped sharply, and the crisis tarnished Madagascar&#x27;s budding reputation as an AGOA standout and a promising place to invest. After the crisis, the economy rebounded with GDP growth of over 10% in 2003. Currency depreciation and rising inflation in 2004 hampered economic performance, but growth for the year reached 5.3%, with inflation reaching around 25% at the end of the year. In 2005, inflation was brought under control by tight monetary policy of raising the &quot;Taux Directeur&quot; (central bank rate) to 16% and tightening reserve requirements for banks. Thus growth was expected to reach around 6.5% in 2005.

During Ravalomanana&#x27;s presidency, the government adopted a series of business laws and regulations, including the commercial companies law (2003), labor law (2003), regulations on the application of commercial companies law (2004), public procurement law (2004), competition law (2005), foreign exchange law (2006), investment law (2007), and free zones and free enterprises law (2007).

==Food security, vulnerability and risk management==

Despite a wealth of abundant and diverse natural resources, Madagascar is one of the world&#x27;s poorest countries. Madagascar holds great potential for agricultural development, mainly due to the large variety of soil types and climatic diversity. Nevertheless, natural hazards (cyclones, drought, locust invasions) combined with old-fashioned farming practices limit production.

The standard of living of the Malagasy population has been declining dramatically over the past 25 years. The country has gone from being a net exporter of agricultural products in the 1960s to a net importer since 1971. Inappropriate traditional agricultural methods cause soil to erode and soil quality to decline, and the basis of survival for Madagascar&#x27;s people is under serious threat.

==Energy==
As of 2018, only 15% of the population of Madagascar has access to electricity. By 2023, this has increased to 34%. Madagascar has a technically feasible hydropower potential of about 180,000 GWh. Less than 1% has been developed so far, with 162 MW of installed hydro capacity producing 61% of the country&#x27;s electricity. The country has enormous potential for exploiting solar power, but general infrastructure is still lacking.

==Poverty reduction==

In 2000, Madagascar embarked on the preparation of a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) under the Heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) Initiative. The boards of the IMF and of the World Bank concurred in December 2000 that the country was eligible under the HIPC Initiative, and Madagascar reached the decision point for debt relief. On March 1, 2001, the IMF Board granted the country $103 million for 2001–03 under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGR). Resources were intended for improving access to health, education, rural roads, water, and direct support to communities. In addition, on March 7, 2001, the Paris Club approved a debt cancellation of $161 million. On February 28, 2001, the African Development Bank (ADB) approved under the HIPC a debt cancellation of $71.46 million and granted in June 2001 an additional credit of $20 million to fight against AIDS and poverty.

Partly as a result of these credits but also as a result of previous reforms, average GDP growth exceeded the population growth rate of 2.8% in 1997 (3.5%), 1998 (3.9%), 1999 (4.7%) and 2000 (4.8%).

In October 2004, the boards of the IMF and the World Bank determined that Madagascar had reached the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.

<text>Communications in [[Madagascar]] include newspapers, radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, cinema, and the Internet.

Widespread poverty and illiteracy severely limit the penetration of television, print media, and the Internet, making radio by far the most important communications medium in the country.

==Newspapers==

* &quot;L&#x27;Express de Madagascar&quot;, privately-owned daily.
* &quot;Midi Madagasikara&quot;, privately-owned daily.
* &quot;Madagascar Tribune&quot;, privately-owned daily.
* &quot;La Gazette de la Grande Ile&quot;, privately-owned daily.
* &quot;Lakroa (Cross)&quot;, Catholic weekly.

===Press freedom===

While the constitution provides for freedom of the press, the ability of the press to criticize the regime is severely limited. In particular the absence of a communications code protecting press freedoms allows authorities to prosecute journalists under libel law and the criminal code whenever the content of their reporting offends the facto regime.

In November 2012 the de facto minister of communications stated that assertions harming the &quot;general interest&quot; were banned from public media. Gendarmes interrogated the editor-in-chief of &quot;Le Courrier de Madagascar&quot; for several hours in April 2012 after he ran a story entitled, &quot;Governance--the Brothel Takes Hold at High Levels.&quot; Investigative journalists are often targets of threats and harassment from authorities. In May 2012 police stopped a journalist from &quot;La Verite&quot;, a pro-regime newspaper, on his way to cover an event in Antananarivo. Police reportedly beat him and broke his arm. All journalists released on bail remained subject to rearrest at any time.

==Radio and television==

* Radio stations: State-owned Radio Nationale Malagasy (RNM) has an extensive national network reach; privately owned radio broadcasters in cities and major towns; state-run radio dominates in rural areas; relays of 2 international broadcasters are available in the capital, Antananarivo (2007).
** Malagasy National Radio (RNM), state-owned.
** Radio Don Bosco, Catholic.
** Radio Lazan&#x27; Iarivo (RLI) (Glory of Iarivo), private.
** Radio Antsiva, private.
* Radios: 3.05 million (1997).
* Television stations: Television Malagasy (TVM) has an extensive national network reach; privately owned TV broadcasters in cities and major towns; relays of 2 international broadcasters are available in Antananarivo (2007).
** Television Malagasy (TVM), state-owned.
** Radio-Television Analamanga (RTA), privately-owned.
** Madagascar TV (MATV), privately-owned.
* Television sets: 325,000 (1997).

Former president, Marc Ravalomanana, and current leader Andry Rajoelina own broadcasting outlets.

===Media restrictions===

Although the law provides for freedom of speech, authorities severely restrict freedom of speech by intimidating opponents and resorting to imprisonment or violence when threats fail to dissuade critics. The de facto minister of communications targeted those who expressed dissent, sending official warning letters to news outlets whose coverage displeased the regime. From 2010 through 2012 an estimated 80 radio and television station licenses withdrawn and the stations ordered suspend broadcasting immediately. By the end of 2012 they had not been authorized to reopen. In September 2012 the editor of the national television station was suspended, reportedly for having opposition politicians on the air. Authorities also suspend journalists who continue to broadcast despite government warnings. To maintain access to sources and remain safe, journalists widely practiced self-censorship.

On 2 May 2012, authorities imprisoned the editors of the private radio station Free FM, Lalatiana Rakotondrazafy and Fidel Razara Pierre, for a two-day investigation following a libel suit brought by Mamy Ravatomanga, a well-known backer of the de facto regime. Following a series of public rallies that same month marking the first anniversary of Free FM and calling for greater press freedom, the radio&#x27;s editors were charged with provoking outrage against the regime, destruction of public goods, mounting opposition to security forces, and holding a public demonstration without authorization. On 22 July 2012, authorities closed the radio station, and the two journalists and another colleague went into hiding. By the end of 2012 Free FM remained closed. But after a deal consented with the two journalists and the regime, initiated by Mamy Ravatomanga, Lalatiana Rakotondrazafy is free and become the allied of the Rajoelina&#x27;s regime.

===Shortwave relay stations===
In 2013, the government of Madagascar and Malagasy Global Business S.A. signed an agreement to operate the Madagascar relay station in Talata-Volonondry. Among its customers are Radio Netherlands Worldwide, NHK World-Japan, BBC World Service, Deutsche Welle, Vatican Radio, Adventist World Radio and Free Press Unlimited.

===Internet censorship and surveillance===

There are generally no restrictions on access to the Internet, or reports that the de facto government monitors e-mail or Internet chat rooms. However, the de facto minister of communication made several statements throughout 2012 about restricting the Internet.

Political groups, parties, and activists use the Internet extensively to advance their agendas, share news, and criticize other parties. Although there have been allegations of technical sabotage of some Web sites, the Internet is considered among the more reliable sources of information, as many Internet servers were outside the country and cannot be regulated by the regime.

The constitution and law provide for freedom of speech and press, but the de facto regime and military actors actively and systematically impeded the exercise of freedoms of expression and of the press. The law prohibits arbitrary Interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence, but homes and workplaces of opposition groups are subject to arbitrary searches without warrants. Regime security personnel also punished family members for alleged offenses committed by individuals.

In October 2023, &quot;Mediapart&quot; newspaper revealed that the Malagasy presidency acquired the Predator spyware in 2021 illegally and used it to spy on several political opponents, including the opposition newspaper, Roland Rasoamaharo, who was subsequently imprisoned. According to two technical investigations, Predator was also used by the Malagasy government during the 2023 elections.

An investigation by the Central Office for the Fight against Crimes Against Humanity, Genocides and War Crimes (OCLCH) established that the leaders of Nexa and Intellexa exported equipment and software to hack phones to the Malagasy presidency, without any authorization.

<text>Paved and unpaved roadways, as well as railways, provide the main forms of transport in Madagascar. Madagascar has approximately of paved roads and 836 km of rail lines. In 2010, Madagascar had of navigable waterways. 

==Railways==
In 2018, Madagascar reported 836 km of rail lines. There are several rail lines and stations in Madagascar. Antananarivo is connected to Toamasina, Ambatondrazaka and Antsirabe by rail, and another rail line connects Fianarantsoa to Manakara. The northern railway (TCE) is concessioned to Madarail. The southern line, Fianarantsoa-Côte-Est railway (FCE), is a parastatal line. 

==Roads==

==Waterways==
The relatively short rivers of Madagascar are typically of local importance only; isolated streams and small portions of Lakandranon&#x27; Ampangalana (Canal des Pangalanes) are navigated by pirogue. Coastal inter-city transport routes are found along the west coast.

Madagascar has 600 km of waterways, 432 km of which are navigable.

==Ports and harbors==
The most important seaport in Madagascar is located on the east coast at Toamasina. Ports at Toliara, Mahajanga, and Antsiranana are significantly less used because of their remoteness. The island&#x27;s newest port at Port d&#x27;Ehola, constructed in 2008 and privately managed by Rio Tinto, will come under state control upon completion of the company&#x27;s mining project near Tôlanaro around 2038. The country&#x27;s principal cargo port is Toamasina Autonomous Port.

==Airports==
The main international airport in Madagascar is Ivato International Airport in Antananarivo. Air Madagascar services the island&#x27;s many small regional airports, which offer the only practical means of access to many of the more remote regions during rainy season road washouts. There are 26 airports with paved runways and 57 airports with unpaved runways. In 2018, Madagascar carried 544,458 air passengers.

<text>The Madagascar Armed Forces (, ) is the national military of Madagascar. The IISS detailed the armed forces in 2012 as including an Army of 12,500+, a Navy of 500, and a 500-strong Air Force.

The armed forces were involved in the 2009 Malagasy political crisis. During World War II, Malagasy troops fought in France, Morocco, and Syria.

== History ==
The rise of centralized kingdoms among the Sakalava, Merina and other ethnic groups produced the island&#x27;s first standing armies, first equipped with spears, but later with muskets, cannons and other firearms. King Ralambo (1575–1612) raised the first standing army in the highland Kingdom of Imerina with a handful of guns, although for at least two centuries the armies of the Sakalava were much larger and better equipped, possessing thousands of muskets obtained principally through trade with European partners. By the early 19th century, however, the army of the Kingdom of Imerina was able to bring much of the island under Merina control.
Merina Queen Ranavalona, like her predecessors, utilized the tradition of &quot;fanampoana&quot; (service due to the sovereign in lieu of taxes) to conscript a large portion of the population of Imerina into military service, enabling the queen to raise a standing army that was estimated at 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers.
By the late 19th century French plans to colonize Madagascar were gaining momentum, leading British mercenaries to provide training to the queen&#x27;s army in an unsuccessful bid to repel the French troops. Madagascar was colonized in 1896, and during World War II over 46,000 Malagasy soldiers were drafted to fight with the Allies, over 2,000 of whom died fighting for France.

Madagascar gained political independence and sovereignty over its military in 1960. Since this time Madagascar has never engaged in an armed conflict, whether against another state or within its own borders. As such the armed forces of Madagascar have primarily served a peacekeeping role. However, the military has occasionally intervened to restore order during periods of political unrest. When President Philibert Tsiranana was forced to step down in 1972, a military directorate ensured an interim government before appointing one of its own, Admiral Didier Ratsiraka, to lead the country into its socialist Second Republic. He launched a strategy of obligatory national armed or civil service for all young citizens regardless of gender. The majority were channeled into civil service, including agriculture and education programs for rural development based on the socialist Soviet model. Ratsiraka would also mobilize elements of the military to pacify unarmed protesters, occasionally using violent means. His order to fire upon unarmed protesters in 1989 was the catalyst for transition to the democratic Third Republic in 1992. The military remained largely neutral during the protracted standoff between incumbent Ratsiraka and challenger Marc Ravalomanana in the disputed 2001 presidential elections. By contrast, in 2009 a segment of the army defected to the side of Andry Rajoelina, then-mayor of Antananarivo, in support of his attempt to force President Ravalomanana from power. It is widely believed that payoffs were involved in persuading these military personnel to change camps in support of the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;.

As of 2010, the military of Madagascar is composed of the 8,100 paramilitary of the National Gendarmerie and the 13,500 members of the Armed Forces. According to the International Institute of Strategic Studies&#x27; Military Balance 2010, the latter includes an Army of 12,500, a Navy of 500 and a 500-strong Air Force, while the CIA Factbook describes the Armed Forces as consisting of the Intervention Force, Aeronaval Force (navy and air) and the Development Force. Military service is voluntary and limited to males aged 18 to 25; every citizen of either gender is required to have perform either military or civil service for a minimum of 18 months. However, because of a lack of up-to-date census data, this requirement is not currently enforced. The Gendarmerie recruits Malagasy citizens between the ages of 20 and 30 (or 35 if the recruit has prior military service). Military expenses constituted just over one percent of GDP. Under Ravalomanana, military expenditure doubled from 54 million USD in 2006 to 103 million USD in 2008.

<doc id="50883" wikidata="Q685248" url="?curid=50883" title="United Nations Commission on Human Rights">
<text>The United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) was a functional commission within the overall framework of the United Nations from 1946 until it was replaced by the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2006. It was a subsidiary body of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), and was also assisted in its work by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNOHCHR). 

It was the UN&#x27;s principal mechanism and international forum concerned with the promotion and protection of human rights. The UNCHR successfully introduced the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948. The body&#x27;s reputation became controversial over time, as many observers saw it as highly politicized and vulnerable to outside pressure. Scholars have found that states with a poor human rights record were more likely to be elected to the body than countries with good records.

On March 15, 2006, the UN General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to replace UNCHR with the UN Human Rights Council.

==History==
The UNHRC was established in 1946 by ECOSOC, and was one of the first two &quot;Functional Commissions&quot; set up within the early UN structure (the other being the Commission on the Status of Women). It was a body created under the terms of the United Nations Charter (specifically, under &quot;Article 68&quot;) to which all UN member states are signatories.

It met for the first time in January 1947 and established a drafting committee for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations on December 10, 1948.

The body went through two distinct phases. From 1947 to 1967, it concentrated on promoting human rights and helping states elaborate treaties, but not on investigating or condemning violators. It was a period of strict observance of the sovereignty principle.

In 1967, the Commission adopted interventionism as its policy. The context of the decade was of Decolonization of Africa and Asia, and many countries of the continent pressed for a more active UN policy on human rights issues, especially in light of massive violations in apartheid South Africa. The new policy meant that the Commission would also investigate and produce reports on violations.

To allow better fulfillment of this new policy, other changes took place. In the 1970s, the possibility of geographically oriented workgroups was created. These groups would specialize in investigating violations in a particular region or even a single country, as was the case with Chile. With the 1980s came the creation of theme-oriented workgroups, which would specialize in specific types of abuses.

None of these measures, however, were able to make the Commission as effective as desired, mainly because of the presence of human rights violators and the politicization of the body. During the following years until its extinction, the UNCHR became increasingly discredited among activists and governments alike.

The Commission held its final meeting in Geneva on March 27, 2006, and was replaced by the United Nations Human Rights Council in the same year.

==Mandate==
The Commission on Human Rights was intended to examine, monitor and publicly report on human rights situations in specific countries or territories (known as country mechanisms or mandates) as well as on major phenomena of human rights violations worldwide (known as thematic mechanisms or mandates). The Human Rights division of the U.N. is also expected to uphold and protect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

==Structure==

At the time it was extinguished, the Commission consisted of representatives drawn from 53 member states, elected by the members of ECOSOC. There were no permanent members: each year (usually in May), approximately a third of its seats would come up for election and those chosen would be appointed for a three-year term.

Seats on the Commission were apportioned by region, using the mechanism of the United Nations Regional Groups. During its last year of service in 2005, the representation by region was as follows.
* 15 from the African Group:
** Burkina Faso, Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Guinea, Kenya, Mauritania, Nigeria, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Togo, Zimbabwe
* 12 from the Asian Group:
** Bhutan, People&#x27;s Republic of China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka
* 5 from the Eastern European Group:
** Armenia, Hungary, Romania, Russian Federation, Ukraine
* 11 from the Latin American and Caribbean Group:

In January 2005, Indonesia was elected chair of the 61st Session. Peru was elected chair of the 62nd Session in January 2006. The Commission held its final meeting in Geneva on March 27, 2006.

==Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights==
In 1999 the Economic and Social Council changed its title from the &quot;Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities&quot; to the &quot;Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights&quot;&quot;.

The Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights was the main subsidiary body of the Commission on Human Rights. It was composed of twenty-six experts whose responsibility was to undertake studies, particularly in light of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and make recommendations to the Commission concerning the prevention of discrimination of any kind relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms and the protection of racial, national, religious and linguistic minorities. Membership was selected with regard to equitable geographical distribution.

The Sub-Commission established seven Working Groups that investigate specific human rights concerns, including:
* Minorities
* Transnational Corporations
* Administration of Justice
* Anti-terrorism
* Contemporary Forms of Slavery
* Indigenous Populations
* Communication
* Social Forum

The United Nations Human Rights Council assumed responsibility for the Sub-Commission when it replaced the Commission on Human Rights in 2006.

==Special procedures==
The Commission on Human Rights established 30 special procedures, or mechanisms, to address specific country situations or thematic issues such as freedom of expression and opinion, torture, the right to food, and the right to education.

Individuals with expertise in particular areas of human rights were appointed by the chair of the Commission to serve as Special Rapporteurs for a maximum of six years. They are unpaid, independent experts who receive personnel and logistical support from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights for their work. Their main activities are to examine, monitor, advise and publicly report on human rights situations in specific countries or territories. They are able to write to governments about reported violations and conduct fact-finding visits to countries that invite them.

The special mechanisms are categorised according to thematic and country mandates.

Special procedures also include working groups made up of up to five experts who monitor and investigate specific human rights concerns. Three groups were established by the Commission:
* Working Group on Arbitrary Detention
* Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances
* Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination

The special procedures are now under the direction of the United Nations Human Rights Council.

==Criticism==
The Commission was repeatedly criticized for the composition of its membership. In particular, several of its member countries themselves had dubious human rights records, including states whose representatives had been elected to chair the Commission. Countries with records of human rights abuses like torture, extrajudicial killings, political imprisonment, and disappearances likely sought election to the Commission to project a positive international image. Commission membership also provided some political shelter from criticism of these abuses.

Another criticism was that the Commission did not engage in constructive discussion of human rights issues, but was a forum for politically selective finger-pointing and criticism. The desire of states with problematic human rights records to be elected to the Commission was viewed largely as a way to defend themselves from such attacks.

Activist groups had long expressed concern over the memberships of the China, Zimbabwe, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan, and the past memberships of Algeria, Syria, Libya, Uganda, and Vietnam on the Commission. These countries had extensive records of human rights violations, and one concern was that by working against resolutions on the Commission condemning human rights violations, they indirectly promoted despotism and domestic repression.

On May 4, 2004, United States Ambassador Sichan Siv walked out of the Commission following the uncontested election of Sudan to the commission and called it an &quot;absurdity&quot; in light of Sudan&#x27;s ethnic cleansing in Darfur. One major consequence of the election of Sudan to the Commission was the lack of willingness of some countries to work through the Commission. For example, on July 30, 2004, it was the United Nations Security Council, not the Commission, that passed a resolution—by 13–0, with China and Pakistan abstaining, threatening Sudan with unspecified sanctions if the situation in the Darfur region did not improve within the following 30 days. The reasons given for the action were the attacks by the Janjaweed Arab militias of Sudan on the non-Arab African Muslim population of Darfur, a region in western Sudan.

The Commission had also come under repeated criticism from the United States for its unwillingness to address other human rights concerns. In 2001, the United States was voted off the Commission by the other member states, many of which have been criticized for their human rights violations, and in 2003, Syria put forward a proposal to discuss US war crimes in Iraq. However, the American journalist Anne Applebaum wrote that &quot;the European Union and the United States aren&#x27;t exempt from blame, either.&quot; She cited their hesitance in voting to criticize Russia&#x27;s actions in Chechnya.

===Israel===
The Commission was also criticized by advocates of Israel for bias against Israel. In 2002, Anne Bayefsky, a professor of international law at York University in Toronto, wrote that &quot;commission members seek to avoid directly criticizing states with human rights problems, frequently by focusing on Israel, a state that, according to analysis of summary records, has for over 30 years occupied 15 percent of commission time and has been the subject of a third of country-specific resolutions&quot;. On April 15, 2002, the Commission approved a resolution affirming the &quot;legitimate right of the Palestinian people to resist the Israeli occupation in order to free its land and be able to exercise its right of self-determination&quot;. In so doing, the Palestinian people was declared &quot;fulfilling its mission, one of the goals and purposes of the United Nations&quot;. Of the 53-member commission, 40 countries voted yes, five voted no, and seven abstained. Although widely reported that the resolution condoned resistance to Israel by &quot;all available means, including armed struggle&quot;, the resolution itself does not contain those words. Alfred Moses, a former United States ambassador to the Commission who is now the chairman of the monitoring group UN Watch, said, &quot;A vote in favour of this resolution is a vote for Palestinian terrorism.&quot; In a letter to the Commission on November 15, 2002, following an attack by Palestinians on Israelis in the town of Hebron, Nabil Ramlawi, the Permanent Observer for Palestine at the UN, appealed to the resolution as justification for the attack.

===Human rights and mental health===
In 1977, the Commission formed a &quot;Sub-Commission to study, with a view to formulating guidelines, if possible, the question of the protection of those detained on the grounds of mental ill-health against treatment that might adversely affect the human personality and its physical and intellectual integrity.&quot; The sub-commission was charged with &quot;determin[ing] whether adequate grounds existed for detaining persons on the grounds of mental ill-health.&quot; The guidelines that resulted, UN Principles for the Protection of Persons with Mental Illness and for the Improvement of Mental Health Care, have been criticized for ignoring and failing to protect the rights of involuntary patients.

==Genocide==
The United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) passed a number of resolutions concerning genocide: UNCHR Decision 9 (XXXV); 1986/18; 1987/25; 1988/28; 1989/16; 1990/19; &quot;Fiftieth Anniversary of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide&quot;, 1998/10; and &quot;Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide&quot;, 1999/67.

In 1978 the UNCHR endorsed the recommendation of the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities to distribute widely the Ruhashyankiko Report.

In August 1992, the UNCHR &quot;condemn[ed] absolutely the concept and practice of &#x27;ethnic cleansing&#x27;&quot; in the former Yugoslavia but did not describe it as genocide. The Commission&#x27;s resolution was endorsed by the UNCHR parent body, the United Nations Economic and Social Council. In November 1992, the UNCHR &quot;call[ed] upon all States to consider the extent to which the acts committed in Bosnia ... and in Croatia constitute genocide in accordance with [the Genocide Convention]&quot;.

At the request of Canada in May 1994, an emergency meeting was convened to deal with the ongoing genocide in Rwanda. René Degni-Segui was appointed as a Special Rapporteur, immediately visited Rwanda and promptly issued a report on the scope of the genocide.

<doc id="50884" wikidata="Q1359" url="?curid=50884" title="Chelicerata">
<text>The subphylum Chelicerata (from Neo-Latin, , ) constitutes one of the major subdivisions of the phylum Arthropoda. Chelicerates include the sea spiders, horseshoe crabs, and arachnids (including harvestmen, scorpions, spiders, solifuges, ticks, and mites, among many others), as well as a number of extinct lineages, such as the eurypterids (sea scorpions) and chasmataspidids.

Chelicerata split from Mandibulata by the mid-Cambrian, as evidenced by stem-group chelicerates like Habeliida and &quot;Mollisonia&quot; present by this time. The surviving marine species include the four species of xiphosurans (horseshoe crabs), and possibly the 1,300 species of pycnogonids (sea spiders), if the latter are indeed chelicerates. On the other hand, there are over 77,000 well-identified species of air-breathing chelicerates, and there may be about 500,000 unidentified species.

Like all arthropods, chelicerates have segmented bodies with jointed limbs, all covered in a cuticle made of chitin and proteins. The chelicerate body plan consists of two tagmata, the prosoma and the opisthosoma – excepting the mites, which have lost any visible division between these sections. The chelicerae, which give the group its name, are the only appendages that appear before the mouth. In most sub-groups, they are modest pincers used to feed. However, spiders&#x27; chelicerae form fangs that most species use to inject venom into prey. The group has the open circulatory system typical of arthropods, in which a tube-like heart pumps blood through the hemocoel, which is the major body cavity. Marine chelicerates have gills, while the air-breathing forms generally have both book lungs and tracheae. In general, the ganglia of living chelicerates&#x27; central nervous systems fuse into large masses in the cephalothorax, but there are wide variations and this fusion is very limited in the Mesothelae, which are regarded as the oldest and most basal group of spiders. Most chelicerates rely on modified bristles for touch and for information about vibrations, air currents, and chemical changes in their environment. The most active hunting spiders also have very acute eyesight.

Chelicerates were originally predators, but the group has diversified to use all the major feeding strategies: predation, parasitism, herbivory, scavenging and eating decaying organic matter. Although harvestmen can digest solid food, the guts of most modern chelicerates are too narrow for this, and they generally liquidize their food by grinding it with their chelicerae and pedipalps and flooding it with digestive enzymes. To conserve water, air-breathing chelicerates excrete waste as solids that are removed from their blood by Malpighian tubules, structures that also evolved independently in insects.

While the marine horseshoe crabs rely on external fertilization, air-breathing chelicerates use internal but usually indirect fertilization. Many species use elaborate courtship rituals to attract mates. Most lay eggs that hatch as what look like miniature adults, but all scorpions and a few species of mites keep the eggs inside their bodies until the young emerge. In most chelicerate species the young have to fend for themselves, but in scorpions and some species of spider the females protect and feed their young.

The evolutionary origins of chelicerates from the early arthropods have been debated for decades. Although there is considerable agreement about the relationships between most chelicerate sub-groups, the inclusion of the Pycnogonida in this taxon has been questioned, and the exact position of scorpions is still controversial, though they were long considered the most basal of the arachnids.

Venom has evolved three times in the chelicerates; spiders, scorpions and pseudoscorpions, or four times if the hematophagous secretions produced by ticks are included. In addition there have been undocumented descriptions of venom glands in Solifugae. Chemical defense has been found in whip scorpions, shorttailed whipscorpions, harvestmen, beetle mites and sea spiders.

Although the venom of a few spider and scorpion species can be very dangerous to humans, medical researchers are investigating the use of these venoms for the treatment of disorders ranging from cancer to erectile dysfunction. The medical industry also uses the blood of horseshoe crabs as a test for the presence of contaminant bacteria. Mites can cause allergies in humans, transmit several diseases to humans and their livestock, and are serious agricultural pests.

==Description==

===Segmentation and cuticle===
The Chelicerata are arthropods as they have: segmented bodies with jointed limbs, all covered in a cuticle made of chitin and proteins; heads that are composed of several segments that fuse during the development of the embryo; a much reduced coelom; a hemocoel through which the blood circulates, driven by a tube-like heart. Chelicerates&#x27; bodies consist of two tagmata, sets of segments that serve similar functions: the foremost one, called the prosoma or cephalothorax, and the rear tagma is called the opisthosoma or abdomen. However, in the Acari (mites and ticks) there is no visible division between these sections.

The prosoma is formed in the embryo by fusion of the ocular somite (referred as &quot;acron&quot; in previous literatures), which carries the eyes and labrum, with six post-ocular segments (somite 1 to 6), which all have paired appendages. It was previously thought that chelicerates had lost the antennae-bearing somite 1, but later investigations reveal that it is retained and corresponds to a pair of chelicerae or chelifores, small appendages that often form pincers. Somite 2 has a pair of pedipalps that in most sub-groups perform sensory functions, while the remaining four cephalothorax segments (somite 4 to 6) have pairs of legs. In basal forms the ocular somite has a pair of compound eyes on the sides and four pigment-cup ocelli (&quot;little eyes&quot;) in the middle. The mouth is between somite 1 and 2 (chelicerae and pedipalps).

The opisthosoma consists of thirteen or fewer segments, may or may not end with a telson. In some taxa such as scorpion and eurypterid the opisthosoma divided into two groups, &quot;mesosoma&quot; and &quot;metasoma&quot;. The abdominal appendages of modern chelicerates are missing or heavily modified – for example in spiders the remaining appendages form spinnerets that extrude silk, while those of horseshoe crabs (Xiphosura) form gills.

Like all arthropods, chelicerates&#x27; bodies and appendages are covered with a tough cuticle made mainly of chitin and chemically hardened proteins. Since this cannot stretch, the animals must molt to grow. In other words, they grow new but still soft cuticles, then cast off the old one and wait for the new one to harden. Until the new cuticle hardens the animals are defenseless and almost immobilized.
===Chelicerae and pedipalps===
Chelicerae and pedipalps are the two pairs of appendages closest to the mouth; they vary widely in form and function and the consistent difference between them is their position in the embryo and corresponding neurons: chelicerae are deutocerebral and arise from somite 1, ahead of the mouth, while pedipalps are tritocerebral and arise from somite 2, behind the mouth.

The chelicerae (&quot;claw horns&quot;) that give the sub-phylum its name normally consist of three sections, and the claw is formed by the third section and a rigid extension of the second. However, spiders&#x27; have only two sections, and the second forms a fang that folds away behind the first when not in use. The relative sizes of chelicerae vary widely: those of some fossil eurypterids and modern harvestmen form large claws that extended ahead of the body, while scorpions&#x27; are tiny pincers that are used in feeding and project only slightly in front of the head.

In basal chelicerates, the pedipalps are unspecialized and subequal to the posterior pairs of walking legs. However, in sea spider and arachnids, the pedipalps are more or less specialized for sensory or prey-catching function – for example scorpions have pincers and male spiders have bulbous tips that act as syringes to inject sperm into the females&#x27; reproductive openings when mating.

===Body cavities and circulatory systems===
As in all arthropods, the chelicerate body has a very small coelom restricted to small areas round the reproductive and excretory systems. The main body cavity is a hemocoel that runs most of the length of the body and through which blood flows, driven by a tubular heart that collects blood from the rear and pumps it forward. Although arteries direct the blood to specific parts of the body, they have open ends rather than joining directly to veins, and chelicerates therefore have open circulatory systems as is typical for arthropods.

===Respiratory systems===
These depend on individual sub-groups&#x27; environments. Modern terrestrial chelicerates generally have both book lungs, which deliver oxygen and remove waste gases via the blood, and tracheae, which do the same without using the blood as a transport system. The living horseshoe crabs are aquatic and have book gills that lie in a horizontal plane. For a long time it was assumed that the extinct eurypterids had gills, but the fossil evidence was ambiguous. However, a fossil of the long eurypterid &quot;Onychopterella&quot;, from the Late Ordovician period, has what appear to be four pairs of vertically oriented book gills whose internal structure is very similar to that of scorpions&#x27; book lungs.

===Feeding and digestion===
The guts of most modern chelicerates are too narrow to take solid food. All scorpions and almost all spiders are predators that &quot;pre-process&quot; food in preoral cavities formed by the chelicerae and the bases of the pedipalps. However, one predominantly herbivore spider species is known, and many supplement their diets with nectar and pollen. Many of the Acari (ticks and mites) are blood-sucking parasites, but there are many predatory, herbivore and scavenger sub-groups. All the Acari have a retractable feeding assembly that consists of the chelicerae, pedipalps and parts of the exoskeleton, and which forms a preoral cavity for pre-processing food.

Harvestmen are among the minority of living chelicerates that can take solid food, and the group includes predators, herbivores and scavengers. Horseshoe crabs are also capable of processing solid food, and use a distinctive feeding system. Claws at the tips of their legs grab small invertebrates and pass them to a food groove that runs from between the rearmost legs to the mouth, which is on the underside of the head and faces slightly backwards. The bases of the legs form toothed gnathobases that both grind the food and push it towards the mouth. This is how the earliest arthropods are thought to have fed.

===Excretion===
Horseshoe crabs convert nitrogenous wastes to ammonia and dump it via their gills, and excrete other wastes as feces via the anus. They also have nephridia (&quot;little kidneys&quot;), which extract other wastes for excretion as urine. Ammonia is so toxic that it must be diluted rapidly with large quantities of water. Most terrestrial chelicerates cannot afford to use so much water and therefore convert nitrogenous wastes to other chemicals, which they excrete as dry matter. Extraction is by various combinations of nephridia and Malpighian tubules. The tubules filter wastes out of the blood and dump them into the hindgut as solids, a system that has evolved independently in insects and several groups of arachnids.

===Nervous system===

Chelicerate nervous systems are based on the standard arthropod model of a pair of nerve cords, each with a ganglion per segment, and a brain formed by fusion of the ganglia just behind the mouth with those ahead of it. If one assume that chelicerates lose the first segment, which bears antennae in other arthropods, chelicerate brains include only one pair of pre-oral ganglia instead of two. However, there is evidence that the first segment is indeed available and bears the cheliceres.

There is a notable but variable trend towards fusion of other ganglia into the brain. The brains of horseshoe crabs include all the ganglia of the prosoma plus those of the first two opisthosomal segments, while the other opisthosomal segments retain separate pairs of ganglia. In most living arachnids, except scorpions if they are true arachnids, &quot;all&quot; the ganglia, including those that would normally be in the opisthosoma, are fused into a single mass in the prosoma and there are no ganglia in the opisthosoma. However, in the Mesothelae, which are regarded as the most basal living spiders, the ganglia of the opisthosoma and the rear part of the prosoma remain unfused, and in scorpions the ganglia of the cephalothorax are fused but the abdomen retains separate pairs of ganglia.

===Senses===
As with other arthropods, chelicerates&#x27; cuticles would block out information about the outside world, except that they are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system. In fact, spiders and other arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors. Various touch and vibration sensors, mostly bristles called setae, respond to different levels of force, from strong contact to very weak air currents. Chemical sensors provide equivalents of taste and smell, often by means of setae.

Living chelicerates have both compound eyes (only in horseshoe crabs, as the compound eye in the other clades has been reduced to a cluster of no more than five pairs of ocelli), mounted on the sides of the head, plus pigment-cup ocelli (&quot;little eyes&quot;), mounted in the middle. These median ocelli-type eyes in chelicerates are assumed to be homologous with the crustacean nauplius eyes and the insect ocelli. The eyes of horseshoe crabs can detect movement but not form images. At the other extreme, jumping spiders have a very wide field of vision, and their main eyes are ten times as acute as those of dragonflies, able to see in both colors and UV-light.

===Reproduction===

Horseshoe crabs use external fertilization; the sperm and ova meet outside the parents&#x27; bodies. Despite being aquatic, they spawn on land in the intertidal zone on the beach. The female digs a depression in the wet sand, where she will release her eggs. The male, usually more than one, then releases his sperm onto them. Their trilobite-like larvae look rather like miniature adults as they have full sets of appendages and eyes, but initially they have only two pairs of book-gills and gain three more pairs as they molt.

Also the sea spiders have external fertilization. The male and female release their sperm and eggs into the water where fertilization occurs. The male then collects the eggs and carries them around under his body.

Being air-breathing animals, although many mites have become secondary aquatic, the arachnids use internal fertilization. Except for opiliones and some mites, where the male have a penis used for direct fertilization, fertilization in arachnids is indirect. Indirect fertilization happens in two ways; the male deposit his spermatophore (package of sperm) on the ground, which is then picked up by the female. Or the male store his sperm in appendages modified into sperm transfer organs, such as the pedipalps in male spiders, which is inserted into the female genital openings during copulation. Courtship rituals are common, especially in species where the male risk being eaten before mating. Most arachnids lay eggs, but all scorpions and some mites are viviparous, giving birth to live young (even more mites are ovoviviparous, but most are oviparous). Female pseudoscorpions carry their eggs in a brood pouch on the belly, where the growing embryos feeds on a nutritive fluid provided by the mother during development, and are therefore matrotrophic.

Levels of parental care for the young range from zero to prolonged. Scorpions carry their young on their backs until the first molt, and in a few semi-social species the young remain with their mother. Some spiders care for their young, for example a wolf spider&#x27;s brood cling to rough bristles on the mother&#x27;s back, and females of some species respond to the &quot;begging&quot; behavior of their young by giving them their prey, provided it is no longer struggling, or even regurgitate food.

==Evolutionary history==
===Fossil record===
There are large gaps in the chelicerates&#x27; fossil record because, like all arthropods, their exoskeletons are organic and hence their fossils are rare except in a few lagerstätten where conditions were exceptionally suited to preserving fairly soft tissues. The Burgess shale animals like &quot;Sidneyia&quot; from about have been classified as chelicerates, the latter because its appendages resemble those of the Xiphosura (horseshoe crabs). However, cladistic analyses that consider wider ranges of characteristics place neither as chelicerates. There is debate about whether &quot;Fuxianhuia&quot; from earlier in the Cambrian period, about , was a chelicerate. Another Cambrian fossil, &quot;Kodymirus&quot;, was originally classified as an aglaspid but may have been a eurypterid and therefore a chelicerate. If any of these was closely related to chelicerates, there is a gap of at least 43 million years in the record between true chelicerates and their nearest not-quite chelicerate relatives.

&quot;Sanctacaris&quot;, member of the family Sanctacarididae from the Burgess Shale of Canada, represents the oldest occurrence of a confirmed chelicerate, Middle Cambrian in age. Although its chelicerate nature has been doubted for its pattern of tagmosis (how the segments are grouped, especially in the head), a restudy in 2014 confirmed its phylogenetic position as the oldest chelicerate. Another fossil of the site, &quot;Mollisonia&quot;, is considered a basal chelicerate and it has the oldest known chelicerae and proto-book gills.

The eurypterids have left few good fossils and one of the earliest confirmed eurypterid, &quot;Pentecopterus decorahensis&quot;, appears in the Middle Ordovician period , making it the oldest eurypterid.
Until recently the earliest known xiphosuran fossil dated from the Late Llandovery stage of the Silurian , but in 2008 an older specimen described as &quot;Lunataspis aurora&quot; was reported from about in the Late Ordovician.

The oldest known arachnid is the trigonotarbid &quot;Palaeotarbus jerami&quot;, from about in the Silurian period, and had a triangular cephalothorax and segmented abdomen, as well as eight legs and a pair of pedipalps.

&quot;Attercopus fimbriunguis&quot;, from in the Devonian period, bears the earliest known silk-producing spigots, and was therefore hailed as a spider, but it lacked spinnerets and hence was not a true spider. Rather, it was likely sister group to the spiders, a clade which has been named Serikodiastida. Close relatives of the group survived through to the Cretaceous Period. Several Carboniferous spiders were members of the Mesothelae, a basal group now represented only by the Liphistiidae, and fossils suggest taxa closely related to the spiders, but which were not true members of the group were also present during this Period.

The Late Silurian &quot;Proscorpius&quot; has been classified as a scorpion, but differed significantly from modern scorpions: it appears wholly aquatic since it had gills rather than book lungs or tracheae; its mouth was completely under its head and almost between the first pair of legs, as in the extinct eurypterids and living horseshoe crabs. Fossils of terrestrial scorpions with book lungs have been found in Early Devonian rocks from about . The oldest species of scorpion found as of 2021 is &quot;Dolichophonus loudonensis&quot;, which lived during the Silurian, in present-day Scotland.

===Relationships with other arthropods===

 A recent view of chelicerate phylogeny

 A &quot;traditional&quot; view of chelicerate phylogeny
The &quot;traditional&quot; view of the arthropod &quot;family tree&quot; shows chelicerates as less closely related to the other major living groups (crustaceans; hexapods, which includes insects; and myriapods, which includes centipedes and millipedes) than these other groups are to each other. Recent research since 2001, using both molecular phylogenetics (the application of cladistic analysis to biochemistry, especially to organisms&#x27; DNA and RNA) and detailed examination of how various arthropods&#x27; nervous systems develop in the embryos, suggests that chelicerates are most closely related to myriapods, while hexapods and crustaceans are each other&#x27;s closest relatives. However, these results are derived from analyzing only living arthropods, and including extinct ones such as trilobites causes a swing back to the &quot;traditional&quot; view, placing trilobites as the sister-group of the Tracheata (hexapods plus myriapods) and chelicerates as least closely related to the other groups.
===Major sub-groups===

Shultz (2007)&#x27;s evolutionary family tree of arachnids – † marks extinct groups.

It is generally agreed that the Chelicerata contain the classes Arachnida (spiders, scorpions, mites, etc.), Xiphosura (horseshoe crabs) and Eurypterida (sea scorpions, extinct). The extinct Chasmataspidida may be a sub-group within Eurypterida. The Pycnogonida (sea spiders) were traditionally classified as chelicerates, but some features suggest they may be representatives of the earliest arthropods from which the well-known groups such as chelicerates evolved.

However, the structure of &quot;family tree&quot; relationships within the Chelicerata has been controversial ever since the late 19th century. An attempt in 2002 to combine analysis of DNA features of modern chelicerates and anatomical features of modern and fossil ones produced credible results for many lower-level groups, but its results for the high-level relationships between major sub-groups of chelicerates were unstable, in other words minor changes in the inputs caused significant changes in the outputs of the computer program used (POY). An analysis in 2007 using only anatomical features produced the cladogram on the right, but also noted that many uncertainties remain. In recent analyses the clade Tetrapulmonata is reliably recovered, but other ordinal relationships remain in flux.

The position of scorpions is particularly controversial. Some early fossils such as the Late Silurian &quot;Proscorpius&quot; have been classified by paleontologists as scorpions, but described as wholly aquatic as they had gills rather than book lungs or tracheae. Their mouths are also completely under their heads and almost between the first pair of legs, as in the extinct eurypterids and living horseshoe crabs. This presents a difficult choice: classify &quot;Proscorpius&quot; and other aquatic fossils as something other than scorpions, despite the similarities; accept that &quot;scorpions&quot; are not monophyletic but consist of separate aquatic and terrestrial groups; or treat scorpions as more closely related to eurypterids and possibly horseshoe crabs than to spiders and other arachnids, so that either scorpions are not arachnids or &quot;arachnids&quot; are not monophyletic. Cladistic analyses have recovered &quot;Proscorpius&quot; within the scorpions, based on reinterpretation of the species&#x27; breathing apparatus. This is reflected also in the reinterpretation of &quot;Palaeoscorpius&quot; as a terrestrial animal.

A 2013 phylogenetic analysis (the results presented in a cladogram below) on the relationships within the Xiphosura and the relations to other closely related groups (including the eurypterids, which were represented in the analysis by genera &quot;Eurypterus&quot;, &quot;Parastylonurus&quot;, &quot;Rhenopterus&quot; and &quot;Stoermeropterus&quot;) concluded that the Xiphosura, as presently understood, was paraphyletic (a group sharing a last common ancestor but not including all descendants of this ancestor) and thus not a valid phylogenetic group. Eurypterids were recovered as closely related to arachnids instead of xiphosurans, forming the group Sclerophorata within the clade Dekatriata (composed of sclerophorates and chasmataspidids). This work suggested it is possible that Dekatriata is synonymous with Sclerophorata as the reproductive system, the primary defining feature of sclerophorates, has not been thoroughly studied in chasmataspidids. Dekatriata is in turn part of the Prosomapoda, a group including the Xiphosurida (the only monophyletic xiphosuran group) and other stem-genera. A recent phylogenetic analysis of the chelicerates places the Xiphosura within the Arachnida as the sister group of Ricinulei, but others still retrieve a monophyletic arachnida.

==Diversity==
Although well behind the insects, chelicerates are one of the most diverse groups of animals, with over 77,000 living species that have been described in scientific publications. Some estimates suggest that there may be 130,000 undescribed species of spider and nearly 500,000 undescribed species of mites and ticks. While the earliest chelicerates and the living Pycnogonida (if they are chelicerates) and Xiphosura are marine animals that breathe dissolved oxygen, the vast majority of living species are air-breathers, although a few spider species build &quot;diving bell&quot; webs that enable them to live under water. Like their ancestors, most living chelicerates are carnivores, mainly on small invertebrates. However, many species feed as parasites, herbivores, scavengers and detritivores.
==Interaction with humans==

In the past, Native Americans ate the flesh of horseshoe crabs, and used the tail spines as spear tips and the shells to bail water out of their canoes. More recent attempts to use horseshoe crabs as food for livestock were abandoned when it was found that this gave the meat a bad taste. Horseshoe crab blood contains a clotting agent, &quot;limulus amebocyte lysate&quot;, which is used to test antibiotics and kidney machines to ensure that they are free of dangerous bacteria, and to detect spinal meningitis and some cancers.

Cooked tarantula spiders are considered a delicacy in Cambodia, and by the Piaroa Indians of southern Venezuela. Spider venoms may be a less polluting alternative to conventional pesticides as they are deadly to insects but the great majority are harmless to vertebrates. Possible medical uses for spider venoms are being investigated, for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, strokes, and erectile dysfunction.

Because spider silk is both light and very strong, but large-scale harvesting from spiders is impractical, work is being done to produce it in other organisms by means of genetic engineering. Spider silk proteins have been successfully produced in transgenic goats&#x27; milk,
tobacco leaves,
silkworms,
and bacteria, and recombinant spider silk is now available as a commercial product from some biotechnology companies.

In the 20th century, there were about 100 reliably reported deaths from spider bites, compared with 1,500 from jellyfish stings. Scorpion stings are thought to be a significant danger in less-developed countries; for example, they cause about 1,000 deaths per year in Mexico, but only one every few years in the USA. Most of these incidents are caused by accidental human &quot;invasions&quot; of scorpions&#x27; nests. On the other hand, medical uses of scorpion venom are being investigated for treatment of brain cancers and bone diseases.

Ticks are parasitic, and some transmit micro-organisms and parasites that can cause diseases in humans, while the saliva of a few species can directly cause tick paralysis if they are not removed within a day or two.

A few of the closely related mites also infest humans, some causing intense itching by their bites, and others by burrowing into the skin. Species that normally infest other animals such as rodents may infest humans if their normal hosts are eliminated. Three species of mite are a threat to honey bees and one of these, &quot;Varroa destructor&quot;, has become the largest single problem faced by beekeepers worldwide. Mites cause several forms of allergic diseases, including hay fever, asthma and eczema, and they aggravate atopic dermatitis. Mites are also significant crop pests, although predatory mites may be useful in controlling some of these.

<text>Struthioniformes is an order of birds with only a single extant family, Struthionidae, containing the ostriches. Several other extinct families are known, spanning across the Northern Hemisphere, from the Early Eocene to the early Pliocene, including a variety of flightless forms like the Paleotidae, Geranoididae, Eogruidae and Ergilornithidae, the latter two thought to be closely related to Struthionidae.

== Evolutionary history ==
According to Mayr and Zelenkov (2021), all Struthioniformes are united by the following characters: &quot;a very long and narrow tarsometatarsus with short trochleae for the second and fourth toes, a tubercle next to the pons supratendineus on the distal end of the tibiotarsus, as well as a shortening of all non-ungual phalanges of the fourth toe except for the proximal one&quot; All known members of the group are thought to have been flightless. Struthioniformes were widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere during the Eocene, including Paleotididae from Europe, and Geranoididae from North America, and Eogruidae and Ergilornithidae in Asia. The discovery of &quot;Lumbreornis&quot;, belonging to either Paleotididae or Geranoididae, suggests that Struthiorniformes probably also inhabited South America during the Eocene. Ergilornthidae would persist in Asia into the Early Pliocene, while its sister group Struthionidae likely originated from Asia. Ostriches first appeared in Africa during the early Miocene, around 21 million years ago, before dispersing into Eurasia during the late Miocene, beginning around 12 million years ago.

<text>A space station (or orbital station) is a spacecraft which remains in orbit and hosts humans for extended periods of time. It therefore is an artificial satellite featuring habitation facilities. The purpose of maintaining a space station varies depending on the program. Most often space stations have been research stations, but they have also served military or commercial uses, such as hosting space tourists.

Space stations have been hosting the only continuous presence of humans in space. The first space station was Salyut 1 (1971), hosting the first crew, of the ill-fated Soyuz 11. Consecutively space stations have been operated since Skylab (1973) and occupied since 1987 with the Salyut successor Mir. Uninterrupted occupation has been sustained since the operational transition from the Mir to the International Space Station (ISS), with its first occupation in 2000.

Currently there are two fully operational space stations – the ISS and China&#x27;s &quot;Tiangong&quot; Space Station (TSS), which have been occupied since October 2000 with Expedition 1 and since June 2022 with Shenzhou 14. The highest number of people at the same time on one space station has been 13, first achieved with the eleven day docking to the ISS of the 127th Space Shuttle mission in 2009. The record for most people on all space stations at the same time has been 17, first on May 30, 2023, with 11 people on the ISS and 6 on the TSS.

Space stations are often modular, featuring docking ports, through which they are built and maintained, allowing the joining or movement of modules and the docking of other spacecrafts for the exchange of people, supplies and tools. While space stations generally do not leave their orbit, they do feature thrusters for station keeping.

== History ==
=== Early concepts ===
The first mention of anything resembling a space station occurred in Edward Everett Hale&#x27;s 1868 &quot;The Brick Moon&quot;. The first to give serious, scientifically grounded consideration to space stations were Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and Hermann Oberth about two decades apart in the early 20th century.
In 1929, Herman Potočnik&#x27;s &quot;The Problem of Space Travel&quot; was published, the first to envision a &quot;rotating wheel&quot; space station to create artificial gravity. Conceptualized during the Second World War, the &quot;sun gun&quot; was a theoretical orbital weapon orbiting Earth at a height of . No further research was ever conducted. In 1951, Wernher von Braun published a concept for a rotating wheel space station in &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, referencing Potočnik&#x27;s idea. However, development of a rotating station was never begun in the 20th century.

=== First advances and precursors ===

The first human flew to space and concluded the first orbit on April 12, 1961, with Vostok 1.

The Apollo program had in its early planning instead of a lunar landing a crewed lunar orbital flight and an orbital laboratory station in orbit of Earth, at times called &quot;Project Olympus&quot;, as two different possible program goals, until the Kennedy administration sped ahead and made the Apollo program focus on what was originally planned to come after it, the lunar landing. The Project Olympus space station, or orbiting laboratory of the Apollo program, was proposed as an in-space unfolded structure with the Apollo command and service module docking. While never realized, the Apollo command and service module would perform docking maneuvers and eventually become a lunar orbiting module which was used for station-like purposes.

But before that the Gemini program paved the way and achieved the first space rendezvous (undocked) with Gemini 6 and Gemini 7 in 1965. Subsequently in 1966 Neil Armstrong performed on Gemini 8 the first ever space docking, while in 1967 Kosmos 186 and Kosmos 188 were the first spacecrafts that docked automatically.

In January 1969, Soyuz 4 and Soyuz 5 performed the first docked, but not internal, crew transfer, and in March, Apollo 9 performed the first ever internal transfer of astronauts between two docked spaceships.

=== Salyut, Almaz and Skylab ===
In 1971, the Soviet Union developed and launched the world&#x27;s first space station, Salyut 1. The Almaz and Salyut series were eventually joined by Skylab, &quot;Mir&quot;, and Tiangong-1 and Tiangong-2. The hardware developed during the initial Soviet efforts remains in use, with evolved variants comprising a considerable part of the ISS, orbiting today. Each crew member stays aboard the station for weeks or months but rarely more than a year.

Early stations were monolithic designs that were constructed and launched in one piece, generally containing all their supplies and experimental equipment. A crew would then be launched to join the station and perform research. After the supplies had been consumed, the station was abandoned.

The first space station was Salyut 1, which was launched by the Soviet Union on April 19, 1971. The early Soviet stations were all designated &quot;Salyut&quot;, but among these, there were two distinct types: civilian and military. The military stations, Salyut 2, Salyut 3, and Salyut 5, were also known as Almaz stations.

The civilian stations Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 were built with two docking ports, which allowed a second crew to visit, bringing a new spacecraft with them; the Soyuz ferry could spend 90 days in space, at which point it needed to be replaced by a fresh Soyuz spacecraft. This allowed for a crew to man the station continually. The American Skylab (1973–1979) was also equipped with two docking ports, like second-generation stations, but the extra port was never used. The presence of a second port on the new stations allowed Progress supply vehicles to be docked to the station, meaning that fresh supplies could be brought to aid long-duration missions. This concept was expanded on Salyut 7, which &quot;hard docked&quot; with a TKS tug shortly before it was abandoned; this served as a proof of concept for the use of modular space stations. The later Salyuts may reasonably be seen as a transition between the two groups.

=== &quot;Mir&quot; ===
Unlike previous stations, the Soviet space station &quot;Mir&quot; had a modular design; a core unit was launched, and additional modules, generally with a specific role, were later added. This method allows for greater flexibility in operation, as well as removing the need for a single immensely powerful launch vehicle. Modular stations are also designed from the outset to have their supplies provided by logistical support craft, which allows for a longer lifetime at the cost of requiring regular support launches.

===International Space Station===
The ISS is divided into two main sections, the Russian Orbital Segment (ROS) and the US Orbital Segment (USOS). The first module of the ISS, Zarya, was launched in 1998.

The Russian Orbital Segment&#x27;s &quot;second-generation&quot; modules were able to launch on Proton, fly to the correct orbit, and dock themselves without human intervention. Connections are automatically made for power, data, gases, and propellants. The Russian autonomous approach allows the assembly of space stations prior to the launch of crew.

The Russian &quot;second-generation&quot; modules are able to be reconfigured to suit changing needs. As of 2009, RKK Energia was considering the removal and reuse of some modules of the ROS on the Orbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex after the end of mission is reached for the ISS. However, in September 2017, the head of Roscosmos said that the technical feasibility of separating the station to form OPSEK had been studied, and there were now no plans to separate the Russian segment from the ISS.

In contrast, the main US modules launched on the Space Shuttle and were attached to the ISS by crews during EVAs. Connections for electrical power, data, propulsion, and cooling fluids are also made at this time, resulting in an integrated block of modules that is not designed for disassembly and must be deorbited as one mass.

Axiom Station is a planned commercial space station that will begin as a single module docked to the ISS. Axiom Space gained NASA approval for the venture in January 2020. The first module, the Payload Power Transfer Module (PPTM), is expected to be launched to the ISS no earlier than 2027. PPTM will remain at the ISS until the launch of Axiom&#x27;s Habitat One (Hab-1) module about one year later, after which it will detach from the ISS to join with Hab-1.

===&quot;Tiangong&quot; program===

China&#x27;s first space laboratory, Tiangong-1 was launched in September 2011. The uncrewed Shenzhou 8 then successfully performed an automatic rendezvous and docking in November 2011. The crewed Shenzhou 9 then docked with Tiangong-1 in June 2012, followed by the crewed Shenzhou 10 in 2013.

According to the China Manned Space Engineering Office, Tiangong-1 reentered over the South Pacific Ocean, northwest of Tahiti, on 2 April 2018 at 00:15 UTC.

A second space laboratory Tiangong-2 was launched in September 2016, while a plan for Tiangong-3 was merged with Tiangong-2. The station made a controlled reentry on 19 July 2019 and burned up over the South Pacific Ocean.

The &quot;Tiangong&quot; Space Station (), the first module of which was launched on 29 April 2021, is in low Earth orbit, 340 to 450 kilometres above the Earth at an orbital inclination of 42° to 43°. Its planned construction via 11 total launches across 2021–2022 was intended to extend the core module with two laboratory modules, capable of hosting up to six crew.

=== Planned projects ===
==Architecture==
Two types of space stations have been flown: monolithic and modular. Monolithic stations consist of a single vehicle and are launched by one rocket. Modular stations consist of two or more separate vehicles that are launched independently and docked on orbit. Modular stations are currently preferred due to lower costs and greater flexibility.

A space station is a complex vehicle that must incorporate many interrelated subsystems, including structure, electrical power, thermal control, attitude determination and control, orbital navigation and propulsion, automation and robotics, computing and communications, environmental and life support, crew facilities, and crew and cargo transportation. Stations must serve a useful role, which drives the capabilities required.

=== Orbit and purpose ===

===Materials===
Space stations are made from durable materials that have to weather space radiation, internal pressure, micrometeoroids, thermal effects of the sun and cold temperatures for long periods of time. They are typically made from stainless steel, titanium and high-quality aluminum alloys, with layers of insulation such as Kevlar as a ballistics shield protection.

The International Space Station (ISS) has a single inflatable module, the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, which was installed in April2016 after being delivered to the ISS on the SpaceX CRS-8 resupply mission. This module, based on NASA research in the 1990s, weighs and was transported while compressed before being attached to the ISS by the space station arm and inflated to provide a volume. Whilst it was initially designed for a 2year lifetime it was still attached and being used for storage in August 2022.

=== Construction ===
* Salyut 1 – first space station, launched in 1971
* Skylab – launched in a single launch in May 1973
* Mir – first modular space station assembled in orbit
* International Space Station – modular space station assembled in orbit
* Tiangong space station – Chinese space station

===Habitability===

The space station environment presents a variety of challenges to human habitability, including short-term problems such as the limited supplies of air, water, and food and the need to manage waste heat, and long-term ones such as weightlessness and relatively high levels of ionizing radiation. These conditions can create long-term health problems for space-station inhabitants, including muscle atrophy, bone deterioration, balance disorders, eyesight disorders, and elevated risk of cancer.

Future space habitats may attempt to address these issues, and could be designed for occupation beyond the weeks or months that current missions typically last. Possible solutions include the creation of artificial gravity by a rotating structure, the inclusion of radiation shielding, and the development of on-site agricultural ecosystems. Some designs might even accommodate large numbers of people, becoming essentially &quot;cities in space&quot; where people would reside semi-permanently.

Molds that develop aboard space stations can produce acids that degrade metal, glass, and rubber. Despite an expanding array of molecular approaches for detecting microorganisms, rapid and robust means of assessing the differential viability of the microbial cells, as a function of phylogenetic lineage, remain elusive.

=== Power ===
Like uncrewed spacecraft close to the Sun, space stations in the inner Solar System generally rely on solar panels to obtain power.

=== Life support ===

Space station air and water is brought up in spacecraft from Earth before being recycled. Supplemental oxygen can be supplied by a solid fuel oxygen generator.

=== Communications ===

=== Military ===
The last military-use space station was the Soviet Salyut 5, which was launched under the Almaz program and orbited between 1976 and 1977.

== Occupation ==
Space stations have harboured so far the only long-duration direct human presence in space. After the first station, Salyut 1 (1971), and its tragic Soyuz 11 crew, space stations have been operated consecutively since Skylab (1973–1974), having allowed a progression of long-duration direct human presence in space. Long-duration resident crews have been joined by visiting crews since 1977 (Salyut 6), and stations have been occupied by consecutive crews since 1987 with the Salyut successor Mir. Uninterrupted occupation of stations has been achieved since the operational transition from the Mir to the ISS, with its first occupation in 2000. The ISS has hosted the highest number of people in orbit at the same time, reaching 13 for the first time during the eleven day docking of STS-127 in 2009.

The duration record for a single spaceflight is 437.75 days, set by Valeri Polyakov aboard &quot;Mir&quot; from 1994 to 1995. , four cosmonauts have completed single missions of over a year, all aboard &quot;Mir&quot;.

== Operations ==

=== Resupply and crew vehicles ===
Many spacecraft are used to dock with the space stations. Soyuz flight T-15 in March to July 1986 was the first and as of 2016, only spacecraft to visit two different space stations, Mir and Salyut 7.

====International Space Station====

====Mir====

The Mir space station was in orbit from 1986 to 2001 and was supported and visited by the following spacecraft:

* Roscosmos Progress (multiple variants) (1986–2000) – An additional Progress spacecraft was used in 2001 to deorbit Mir.
* Energia Soyuz (multiple variants) (1986–2000)
* Space Shuttle (1995–1998)

====Skylab====

* Apollo command and service module (1973–1974)

====Salyut programme====

* Energia Soyuz (multiple variants) (1971–1986)

=== Docking and berthing===

=== Maintenance ===

=== Research ===

Research conducted on the Mir included the first long term space based ESA research project EUROMIR95 which lasted 179days and included 35 scientific experiments.

During the first 20 years of operation of the International Space Station, there were around 3,000 scientific experiments in the areas of biology and biotech, technology development, educational activities, human research, physical science, and Earth and space science.

==== Materials research ====
Space stations provide a useful platform to test the performance, stability, and survivability of materials in space. This research follows on from previous experiments such as the Long Duration Exposure Facility, a free flying experimental platform which flew from April1984 until January1990.
* Mir Environmental Effects Payload (1996–1997)
* Materials International Space Station Experiment (2001–present)

==== Human research ====

==== Botany ====
=== Space tourism ===

On the International Space Station, guests sometimes pay $50 million to spend the week living as an astronaut. Later, space tourism is slated to expand once launch costs are lowered sufficiently. By the end of the 2020s, space hotels may become relatively common.

== Finance ==

As it currently costs on average $10,000 to $25,000 per kilogram to launch anything into orbit, space stations remain the exclusive province of government space agencies, which are primarily funded by taxation. In the case of the International Space Station, space tourism makes up a small portion of money to run it.

== Legacy ==

=== Technology spinoffs ===
=== International cooperation and economy ===

=== Cultural impact ===
=== Space settlement ===

<text>French grammar is the set of rules by which the French language creates statements, questions and commands. In many respects, it is quite similar to that of the other Romance languages.

French is a moderately inflected language. Nouns and most pronouns are inflected for number (singular or plural, though in most nouns the plural is pronounced the same as the singular even if spelled differently); adjectives, for number and gender (masculine or feminine) of their nouns; personal pronouns and a few other pronouns, for person, number, gender, and case; and verbs, for tense, aspect, mood, and the person and number of their subjects. Case is primarily marked using word order and prepositions, while certain verb features are marked using auxiliary verbs.

==Verbs==
Verbs in French are conjugated to reflect the following information:
* a mood (indicative, imperative, subjunctive, or conditional)
* a tense (past, present, or future, though not all tenses can be combined with all moods)
* an aspect (perfective or imperfective)
* a voice (active, passive, or reflexive)
* Nonfinite forms (e.g., participles, gerunds, infinitives)

Some of these features are combined into seven tense–aspect–mood combinations. The simple (one-word) forms are commonly referred to as the present, the simple past or preterite (past tense, perfective aspect), the imperfect (past tense, imperfective aspect), the future, the conditional, the present subjunctive, and the imperfect subjunctive. However, the simple past is rarely used in informal French, and the imperfect subjunctive is rarely used in modern French.

Verbs in the finite moods (indicative, imperative, subjunctive, and conditional) are also conjugated to agree with their subjects in person (first, second, or third) and number (singular or plural). As in English, the subject must be included (except in the imperative mood); in other words, unlike other Romance languages, French is neither a null-subject nor a pro-drop language.

Auxiliary verbs are combined with past participles of main verbs to produce compound tenses, including the compound past (). For most main verbs the auxiliary is (the appropriate form of) (&quot;to have&quot;), but for reflexive verbs and certain intransitive verbs the auxiliary is a form of (&quot;to be&quot;). The participle agrees with the subject when the auxiliary is , and with a preceding direct object (if any) when the auxiliary is . Forms of are also used with the past participles of transitive verbs to form the passive voice.

The imperative mood, which only has first-person plural and second-person singular and plural forms, usually has forms similar or identical to the corresponding ones in the present indicative.

==Nouns==

=== Gender ===
Every French noun has a grammatical gender, either masculine or feminine. The grammatical gender of a noun referring to a human usually corresponds to the noun&#x27;s natural gender (i.e., its referent&#x27;s sex or gender). For such nouns, there will very often be one noun of each gender, with the choice of noun being determined by the natural gender of the person described; for example, a male singer is , while a female singer is either (a pop singer) or (an opera singer). A plural noun that refers to both males and females is masculine. In some cases, the two nouns are identical in form, with the difference only being marked in neighbouring words (due to gender agreement; see below); a Catholic man is , while a Catholic woman is . Nonetheless, there are some such nouns that retain their grammatical gender regardless of natural gender; &#x27;person&#x27; is always feminine, while (at least in &quot;standard&quot; French) &#x27;teacher&#x27; is always masculine. In Canadian French, is the standard feminine form, which is becoming more and more common in European French.

A noun&#x27;s gender is not perfectly predictable from its form, but there are some trends. As a very broad trend, nouns ending in tend to be feminine (e.g., &#x27;a star&#x27;, &#x27;a car&#x27;), while the rest tend to be masculine (e.g., &#x27;a balloon&#x27;, &#x27;a pen&#x27;), but it sometimes can be the opposite. More consistently, some endings, such as , , , and occur almost exclusively with feminine nouns, while others, such as , , and occur almost exclusively with masculine ones. Many nouns ending in preceded by double consonants are also masculine (e.g. ). Nonetheless, a noun that seems masculine judging by its ending might actually be feminine e.g., &#x27;the skin&#x27;, &#x27;a tooth&#x27; or vice versa e.g., &#x27;the elbow&#x27;, &#x27;a skeleton&#x27; are masculine. Noun clauses are masculine.

A very small number of nouns can be used either in masculine or feminine gender with the same meaning (e.g., &#x27;afternoon&#x27;). Often one gender is preferred over the other. Some (very rare) nouns change gender according to the way they are used: the words &#x27;love&#x27; and &#x27;pleasure&#x27; are masculine in singular and feminine in plural; the word &#x27;organ&#x27; is masculine, but when used emphatically in plural to refer to a church organ it becomes feminine (); the plural noun &#x27;people&#x27; changes gender in a very unusual way, being usually masculine but triggering feminine agreement when certain adjectives precede the word.

Other nouns change meaning depending on which grammatical gender they are used in. For example, (masculine) refers to a critic, while (feminine) means criticism; refers to a book, while means the pound (in the sense of both weight and currency). Similarly, means &quot;veil&quot;, whereas means &quot;sail&quot;.

The vocabulary of French includes many homophones, i.e., pairs of words with different spellings but the same pronunciation. Grammatical gender, however, may serve to distinguish some of these. For example, &#x27;the pot&#x27; and &#x27;the skin&#x27; are both pronounced but disagree in gender.

=== Number ===
As in English, nouns inflect for number. 

Orthographically, the plural is usually formed from the singular by adding the letter (cf. &#x27;houses&#x27;). Nouns ending in and often take the ending instead (cf. &#x27;games&#x27;). However, the endings and are in most cases not pronounced, meaning that in speech the plural form of a noun generally has the same pronunciation as the singular. Nouns that end in or in the singular are left unchanged in the plural in both pronunciation and spelling (cf. &#x27;crosses&#x27;, both pronounced ).

Liaison between a plural noun and a following adjective is one case where the plural ending or may be pronounced: (&quot;open windows&quot;). However, this form of liaison usually only appears in careful formal speech (for example by newsreaders). In most everyday speech singular and plural forms of most nouns are therefore homophonous in all contexts.

In spoken French, the plurality of most nouns is marked not on the form of the noun itself but by a preceding article or determiner (cf. [la mɛzɔ̃] &#x27;the house&#x27; &gt; [le mɛzɔ̃] &#x27;the houses&#x27;; [mɔ̃ fʁɛːʁ] &#x27;my brother&#x27; &gt; [me fʁɛːʁ] &#x27;my brothers&#x27;).

French nouns whose spoken plural forms are distinguished from the singular include most of those ending in , whose plural form is (cf. &gt; &#x27;horses&#x27;), as well as a few nouns ending in that also follow this pattern (cf. &gt; &#x27;works&#x27;). Three nouns form completely irregular plurals: &gt; &#x27;ancestors&#x27; (but &#x27;grandfathers&#x27;); &gt; &#x27;heavens&#x27; (but &#x27;bed canopies&#x27;); and &gt; &#x27;eyes&#x27; (but &#x27;oculi&#x27; (round windows), &#x27;calluses&#x27; (on the feet)). Three other nouns have regular plurals in spelling but have irregular pronunciations: &gt; &#x27;oxen, cattle&#x27;; &gt; &#x27;eggs&#x27;; and &gt; &#x27;bones&#x27;.

As with English, most uncountable nouns are grammatically treated as singular, though some are plural, such as &#x27;mathematics&#x27;; some nouns that are uncountable in English are countable in French, such as &#x27;a piece of information&#x27;.

=== Case ===
Nouns in French are not inflected for any other grammatical categories. (However, personal pronouns are inflected for case and person; see below.)

==Articles and determiners==
Articles and determiners agree in gender and number with the noun they determine; unlike with nouns, this inflection is made in speech as well as in writing.

French has three articles: definite, indefinite, and partitive. The difference between the definite and indefinite articles is similar to that in English (definite: &quot;the&quot;; indefinite: &quot;a&quot;, &quot;an&quot;), except that the indefinite article has a plural form (similar to &quot;some&quot;, though English normally does not use an article before indefinite plural nouns). The partitive article is similar to the indefinite article but used for uncountable singular nouns.

==Adjectives==
An adjective must agree in gender and number with the noun it modifies. French adjectives therefore have four forms: masculine singular, feminine singular, masculine plural, and feminine plural. A few adjectives have a fifth form, viz. an additional masculine singular form for use in liaison before a noun beginning with a vowel or a &quot;mute h&quot;, e.g. (a beautiful garden, a handsome man, a beautiful woman, beautiful children, beautiful houses). This fifth form, which is older, is sometimes used elsewhere in set phrases, e.g. (Philip the Fair or the Handsome of France, 1268–1314) vs. (Philip the Handsome or the Fair of Castile, 1478–1506).

The masculine singular, an adjective&#x27;s basic form, is listed in dictionaries. The feminine singular is normally formed by adding to the basic form. This is silent, which makes many masculine and feminine forms homophonous (cf. &#x27;civil&#x27;, both pronounced ). However, the ending causes &quot;mute&quot; final sounds to be pronounced, whereby masculine-feminine pairs become distinguishable in pronunciation if the masculine form ends in a mute consonant, which is the case with a great deal of adjectives (cf. &gt; &#x27;heavy&#x27;). Under certain circumstances, other minor changes occur in the formation of feminine forms, such as the placement of an accent, the doubling of a consonant, or its replacement with another, changes that often reflect the pronunciation of such endings (cf. &gt; &#x27;good&#x27;; &gt; &#x27;happy&#x27;). Irregular feminine forms include &#x27;beautiful&#x27;, &#x27;white&#x27;, and a limited number of others. If an adjective&#x27;s basic form ends in , it is left unchanged in the feminine (cf. &#x27;rich&#x27;).

The plural is normally formed by adding to the singular (masculine and feminine). This is usually mute, but pronounced in liaison with a following noun that begins with a vowel. Unlike liaison after plural nouns, liaison after plural adjectives is common and even obligatory in standard usage. If the basic form ends in , or , an adjective is left unchanged in the masculine plural (cf. &#x27;soft, gentle&#x27;). A few adjectives take the (also mute) ending in the masculine plural (cf. &#x27;new&#x27;). Plural forms that are distinguishable from the singular outside of liaison environments occur only with adjectives ending in . These normally have in the masculine plural (cf. &gt; &#x27;central&#x27;). By contrast, the feminine plural is formed according to the general rule: .

Due to the aforementioned rules, French adjectives might have four distinguished written forms which are all pronounced the same. This is the case if an adjective&#x27;s masculine and feminine forms are homophonous and if there is no liaison between the adjective and a following noun.

On the other hand, if the masculine and feminine forms have different pronunciations and liaison does occur, all four forms can be distinguishable in pronunciation. Adjective declension is therefore important in spoken French, though to a lesser extent than in writing. (All forms distinguished in pronunciation are also distinguished in writing, but not vice versa.)

Due to the peculiar orthography of French, which denotes mute final consonants, most feminine forms seem regular in terms of their spelling because they are formed by adding to the masculine form, e.g., , , . However, if we put this etymologic orthography aside and consider only current pronunciation, the formation of French female forms becomes quite irregular with several possible &quot;endings&quot;: &gt; , &gt; , &gt; .

Most adjectives, when used attributively, appear after their nouns: (&quot;the &quot;red&quot; wine&quot;). A number of adjectives (often having to do with beauty, age, goodness, or size, a tendency summarized by the acronym &quot;BAGS&quot;), come before their nouns: (&quot;a &quot;beautiful&quot; woman&quot;). With a few adjectives of the latter type, there are two masculine singular forms: one used before consonants (the basic form), and one used before vowels. For example, the adjective (&quot;beautiful&quot;) changes form from (&quot;a &quot;handsome&quot; boy&quot;) to (&quot;a &quot;handsome&quot; man&quot;). Some adjectives change position depending on their meaning, sometimes preceding their nouns and sometimes following them. For example, means &quot;former&quot; when it precedes its noun, but &quot;ancient&quot; when it follows it. To give another example, means &quot;a &quot;tall&quot; man&quot;, whereas means &quot;a &quot;great&quot; man&quot;.

Many compound words contain an adjective, such as &quot;a mother-in-law&quot;, which is distinct from &quot;a beautiful mother&quot;. Some of them use an archaic form of the feminine adjective that lacks the final . These used to be written with an apostrophe, but a hyphen is now (at least since 1960) considered more correct: (formerly, ) &quot;a main country road&quot;, which is distinct from &quot;a long way&quot;, and (formerly, ) &quot;a grandmother&quot;, which is distinct from &quot;a tall mother&quot;.

==Adverbs==
As in English, adverbs in French are used to modify adjectives, other adverbs, verbs, or clauses. Most adverbs are derived from an adjective by adding the suffix , usually to its feminine form ( is analogous to the English suffix &quot;-ly&quot;): e.g. &quot;anciently&quot;, &quot;of old&quot;, &quot;in olden times&quot;; &quot;greatly&quot;; &quot;slowly&quot;; though there are some systematic deviations (e.g. → &quot;patiently&quot;, → &quot;uneasily&quot;), some adverbs are derived irregularly ( &quot;good&quot; → &quot;well&quot;) and others do not derive from adjectives at all.

Adverbs themselves are generally invariable. An exception to this is the adverb &quot;wholly, very&quot; which agrees in gender and number with the adjective it modifies when it is in the feminine and begins with a consonant (e.g. &quot;very small, m.s.&quot;, &quot;very small, m.pl.&quot; but &quot;very small, f.s.&quot;, &quot;very small, f.pl.&quot; — when beginning with a vowel however: &quot;completely, as a whole&quot; (with liaison)).

==Prepositions==
French prepositions link two related parts of a sentence. In word order, they are placed in front of a noun in order to specify the relationship between the noun and the verb, adjective, or other noun that precedes it. Some common French prepositions are: (to, at, in), (next to, beside), (after), (about, on the subject of), (before), (with), (at the home/office of, among), (against), (in), (according to), (from, of, about), (since, for), (in back of, behind), (in front of), (during, while), (in, on, to), (outside of), (facing, across from), (between), (toward), (approximately), (outside of), (until, up to, even), (far from), (despite), (by, through), (among), (during), (for), (near), (as for, regarding), (without), (according to), (under), (according to), (on), (toward).

==Pronouns==
In French, pronouns can be inflected to indicate their role in a clause (subject, direct object, etc.), as well as the person, gender, and number of their referent. Not all of these inflections may be present at once; for example, the relative pronoun (that, which, whom) may have any referent, while the possessive pronoun () may have any role in a clause.

As noted above, French (like English) is a non-pro-drop (&quot;pronoun-dropping&quot;) language; therefore, pronouns feature prominently in the language. Impersonal verbs (e.g., &#x27;to rain&#x27;) use the impersonal pronoun (analogous to English &#x27;it&#x27;).

French object pronouns are all clitics. Some appear so consistently – especially in everyday speech — that some have commented that French could almost be considered to demonstrate polypersonal agreement.

==Negation==
French usually expresses negation in two parts, with the particle attached to the verb, and one or more negative words (connegatives) that modify the verb or one of its arguments. Negation encircles a conjugated verb with after the subject and the connegative after the verb, if the verb is finite or a gerund. However, both parts of the negation come before the targeted verb when it is in its infinitive form. For example:
* &#x27;I took them&#x27; → &#x27;I did not take them&#x27;
* &#x27;I would like to watch a movie and fall asleep&#x27; → &#x27;I would like to watch a movie and not fall asleep&#x27;

Other negative words used in combination with are:
* negative adverbs
: — not anymore, no longer
: — never
: – nowhere
: — not much, hardly (literary)
: — not, not at all (literary)
* negative pronouns
: — nothing
: — nobody
* others
:(determiner) — no/not any (also , literary)
:(restrictive particle) — only

Examples:
* — I do not know.
* — He does not smoke anymore.
* — We did not see anybody.
* — She didn&#x27;t drink anything.
* — I have no idea.
* — You only eat vegetables?

The negative adverbs (and ) follow finite verbs but precede infinitives (along with ):
* — He claims not to smoke/to never smoke/to smoke nothing.

Moreover, it is possible for and to be used as the subject of a sentence, which moves them to the beginning of the sentence (before the ):
* — Nothing is certain.
* — Nobody came.

Several negative words (other than ) can appear in the same sentence, but the sentence is still usually interpreted as a simple negation. When another negative word occurs with , a double negation interpretation usually arises, but this construction is criticised.
* — She never said anything else to anybody.
* — She did not see nobody (i.e., she saw somebody).

=== Colloquial usage ===
In colloquial French, it is common to drop the , although this can create some ambiguity with the construction when written down, as could mean either &#x27;more&#x27; or &#x27;not anymore&#x27;. Generally when is used to mean , the final is pronounced (), whereas it is never pronounced when used to mean &#x27;not anymore&#x27; ().

As an example, the informal sentence could be pronounced with the final () to mean &quot;there is more&quot;, or it could be pronounced without it () to mean &quot;there is none left&quot;.

=== Independent &quot;ne&quot; ===
In certain, mostly literary constructions, can express negation by itself (without or another negative word). The four verbs that can use this construction are (&quot;to be able to&quot;), (&quot;to know&quot;), (&quot;to dare&quot;), and (&quot;to cease&quot;).
* (standard, + ) — &quot;I was not able to come.&quot;
* (casual, &quot;pas&quot; only) [same]
* (literary, &quot;ne&quot; only) [same];&quot;cf.&quot; phrase — &quot;I do not know what [it is]&quot; remaining in colloquial speech as a fossilized phrase

=== Expletive &quot;ne&quot; ===
In certain cases in formal French, the word can be used without signifying negation; the in such instances is known as expletive (French: ):

: — &quot;I am afraid that it might happen again.&quot;
: — &quot;He arrived before we started.&quot;
: — &quot;There are more of them than you think.&quot;

Expletive is found in finite subordinate clauses (never before an infinitive). It is characteristic of literary rather than colloquial style. In other registers French tends to not use any negation at all in such clauses, e.g., .

The following contexts allow expletive 
* the complement clause of verbs expressing fear or avoidance: (to fear), (to be afraid), (to prevent), (to avoid)
* the complement clause of verbs expressing doubt or denial: (to doubt), (to deny)
* adverbial clauses introduced by the following expressions: (before), (unless), (for fear that)
* comparative constructions expressing inequality: (other), (better), (stronger), (less intelligent), etc.

==Existential clauses==
In French, the equivalent of the English existential clause &quot;there is/are&quot; is expressed with (infinitive: ), literally, &quot;it there has&quot; or &quot;it has to it&quot;. As an impersonal verb, the verb may be conjugated to indicate tense, but always remains in the third person singular. For example
* – &quot;There are two shepherds and fifteen sheep in the meadow.&quot;
* – &quot;There will be a lot to eat.&quot;
* – &quot;There appears to have been (lit. would have) two dead and five injured in the accident.&quot; (as in news reporting)
* – &quot;There was nobody at the Martins&#x27; home.&quot;

This construction is also used to express the passage of time since an event occurred, like the English &quot;ago&quot; or &quot;it has been&quot;:
* – &quot;I saw him two days ago.&quot;
* – &quot;It had been a long time since I had seen him.&quot;
* – &quot;The language/usage of one hundred years ago is very different from that of today.&quot;

In informal speech, is typically reduced to , as in:
* 
* 

== Word order ==
The components of a declarative clause are typically arranged in the following order (though not all components are always present):
* Adverbial(s)
* Subject
* (usually a marker for negation, though it has some other uses)
* First- and second-person object pronoun () or the third-person reflexive pronoun ()
* Third-person direct-object pronoun ()
* Third-person indirect-object pronoun ( or )
* The pronoun 
* The pronoun 
* Finite verb (may be an auxiliary)
* Adverbial(s)
* (second marker for negation) The pronouns (if not subject)
* Main verb (if the finite verb is an auxiliary)
* Adverbial(s)
* Direct object
* Indirect object
* Adverbial(s)

:What is called in English (and above) an &quot;indirect object&quot; is in many cases called according to French grammar conventions (e.g., in &#x27;to give sth. to s.o.&#x27; or &#x27;to give s.o. sth.&#x27;). What the French call is a complement introduced by an essentially void or (at least in the case of a noun) required by some particular, otherwise intransitive, verbs: e.g. &#x27;the robbers took advantage of my absence&#x27; — but the essentially synonymous has a direct object instead. Unlike in English, in French neither an indirect object nor a circumstantial can become the subject of the passive voice: has no direct equivalent in French.
The most common word order in French is subject-verb-object (SVO).

* (I love chocolate).

French also allows for verb-object-subject (VOS) though the usage is relatively rare and various constraints apply. The most common instance of this word order is in more formal texts or in response to questions with a focus on the subject, as opposed to more broad questions such as, (what happened?). Below are examples of each circumstance.

* Formal or administrative text – (students as well as academic staff will receive a ballot paper).
* Response to questions with a focus on the subject – (who ate the cakes?)
** (Marie, Pierre and Stephanie are those who ate the cakes).

Finally, in a comparatively limited number of instances French allows for object-subject-verb (OSV) word order, such as when adding emphasis

In regard to word order, French is more restrictive than other Romance languages. For example, Spanish allows for all six possible word orders, compared to French’s three. Additionally, unlike other Romance languages, specifically Spanish and Italian, French does not have free inversion, which is often explained by French not being a pro-drop language (while Spanish and Italian are).

=== Negation ===
As mentioned above, French expresses negation in two parts, the first with the particle ne attached to the verb and one or more negative words, which modify either the verb or one of its arguments. The participle ne comes before the verb in the sentence that is marked for tense and before any unstressed object pronouns that come before the verb. The location of the second part of the negation varies, however.

=== History ===
Modern French allows for fewer word orders than Latin or Old French, both of which Modern French has evolved from. In both Latin and Old French, all six potential word orders are possible:

* Subject-verb-object (SVO)
* Verb-object-subject (VOS)
* Object-subject-verb (OSV)
* Subject-object-verb (SOV)
* Object-verb-subject (OVS)
* Verb-subject-object (VSO)

While linguistic evolution occurs on a continuum, the major shift towards increased grammaticalization occurred in French most distinctly between the mid 12th century and end of the 15th century. It is believed that the progressive move towards SVO as the dominant French word order occurred during this time, as a result of a &quot;progressive fixation of the subject in preverbal position from the fourteenth century on&quot;.

== Question formation ==
Broadly speaking, there are two types of questions; yes/no questions and information questions.

=== Yes/no questions ===
In French there are four ways to form yes/no questions, each of which is typically associated with a different degree of formality.

==== 1. Raising intonation ====
The simplest and most informal way to ask a yes/no question is by raising intonation at the end of a declarative sentence. This question formation structure is common in informal spoken French, but relatively uncommon in more formal spoken French or written French. Examples include:

* (Is she going to stay here?)
* (Can I put my photos on the wall?)

==== 2. Est-ce que ====
Yes/no questions may also be formed by adding est-ce que to the beginning of a declarative sentence. This structure may be used in any style of French; formal, informal, spoken, or written.

* (Is she going to stay here?)
* (Can I put my photos on the wall?)

==== 3. ..., n&#x27;est-ce pas? ====

Source:

This is like adding &quot;is it not?&quot; to the end and it is pronounced .
* 

==== 4. Inversion of verb and subject ====
Finally, yes/no questions may be formed by inverting the verb and the subject. This sentence structure is typically used in formal and written French. These questions may be formed in one of two ways, depending on whether the pronoun is stressed or unstressed. If the pronoun is unstressed, it changes places with the verb that it agrees with.

* (Are you happy?)

This subject-verb inversion is similar to question formation in English, though in English the inversion may only occur with auxiliary verbs, while in French it may occur with all verbs.

If the subject is anything other than an unstressed pronoun, an unstressed subject pronoun that agrees with the subject is added to the right of the verb.

* (Is Pierre happy?)

Two additional notes on subject verb inversion in French. First, when the inversion results in the adjacency of two vowels is inserted between them.

* T-insertion: (Is he 17?)

Secondly, only the most formal French inverts the verb with &quot;. It has become more common, both in spoken and written French, to replace je with est-ce-que. For example, the following two sentences are ungrammatical in French.

* (Am I lying?)
* (Am I taking the bus?)

=== Information questions ===
There are four ways to form information questions in French. Like yes/no questions, each form is associated with a different degree of formality.

==== 1. Addition of question word or phrase ====
The simplest and generally most informal way to form an information question in French is by replacing a word in a declarative sentence with a question word or phrase and adding rising intonation to the end of the sentence. The question word or phrase may occur at the beginning or end of the sentence, depending on which word is being replaced, unlike in English, where the question word typically occurs at the start of the sentence.

* Declarative sentence – (The student will telephone his/her MP tomorrow.)
* (When will the student telephone his/her MP?)
* (Who will telephone his/her MP tomorrow?)

==== 2. Moving question word or phrase ====
Another common and informal way of forming information questions is by replacing an item in a declarative sentence by a question word or phrase then moving the question word or phrase to the front of the sentence.

* (Who did you see?)
* (Who did Marcel write to?)

==== 3. Addition of &quot;est-ce que&quot; ====
Another way to form a question in French is by following the steps outlined above in one and two, and in addition inserting est-ce que after the question word. This style of question formation may be used in all styles of French.

* (Who did you see?)
* (Who did Marcel write to?)

==== 4. Inversion of verb and subject ====
Finally, information questions in French may be formed by following the steps outlined above in one and two and additionally, inverting the subject and verb. This is typically the most formal form of question formation and is found in written and formal spoken French. As in yes/no question formation, if the subject is an unstressed pronoun, it switches places with the verb:

* (Who did you see?)

If the subject is anything other than an unstressed pronoun, an unstressed subject pronoun is added after the verb.

* (Who did Robert meet?)

== Cleft sentences ==
Cleft sentences are sentences that consist of two clauses, one of which is a copular clause and one of which is a relative clause, also known as a cleft clause. The copular clause consists of a copula followed by the cleft constituent. Cleft sentences are found in many European languages, including French. In the sentence, (&#x27;It&#x27;s Stella who reads Kant&#x27;) &quot; is the copular clause, &quot; is the cleft constituent, and &quot;&quot; is the cleft clause.

=== Types of clefts ===
While cleft sentences are common in European languages, the types of possible cleft sentences vary dramatically by language. Subject clefts, in which the cleft constituent acts as the subject of both the main verb and the cleft clause, are the most common clefts and are found in all languages that have clefts. (&#x27;It&#x27;s Stella who reads Kant&#x27;) is an example of a subject cleft. In complement clefts the cleft constituent is a complement of both the main verb of the cleft clause and the non-cleft clause. For example, (&#x27;it&#x27;s Kant that Stella reads&#x27;). The final type of clefts are adverbial clefts, which are the most common clefts in French, but are not found in all languages with clefts, such as German. In adverbial cleft sentences, the cleft constituent has an adverbial syntactic function. Therefore, the cleft constituent is not subcategorized by the cleft clause&#x27;s main verb and it is not required in corresponding non-cleft clauses.

* Adverbial cleft sentence: (&#x27;It is with ease that Stella reads Kant&#x27;)
* Corresponding non-cleft clause: (&#x27;Stella reads Kant [with ease]&#x27;)

<doc id="50899" wikidata="Q437917" url="?curid=50899" title="Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex">
<text>Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex (; 10 November 1565 – 25 February 1601) was an English nobleman and a favourite of Queen Elizabeth I. Politically ambitious, and a committed general, he was placed under house arrest following a poor campaign in Ireland during the Nine Years&#x27; War in 1599. In 1601, he led an abortive &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; against the government of Elizabeth I and was executed for treason.

==Early life==
Devereux was born on 10 November 1565 at Netherwood near Bromyard, in Herefordshire, the son of Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex, and Lettice Knollys. His maternal great-grandmother Mary Boleyn was a sister of Anne Boleyn, the mother of Queen Elizabeth I, making him a first-cousin-twice-removed of the queen.

He was brought up on his father&#x27;s estates at Chartley Castle, Staffordshire, and at Lamphey, Pembrokeshire, in Wales. He was educated by Thomas Ashton (an influential figure in the evolution of Tudor drama), previously headmaster of Shrewsbury School within his father&#x27;s household.

His father died in 1576, and the new Earl of Essex became a ward of Lord Burghley of Burghley House. In 1577, he was admitted as a fellow-commoner at Trinity College, Cambridge; in 1579, he matriculated; and in 1581 he graduated as a Master of Arts.

On 21 September 1578, Essex&#x27;s mother married Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, Elizabeth I&#x27;s long-standing favourite and Robert Devereux&#x27;s godfather. The following year, Francis Bacon joined the friendship circle comprising Robert, Sir Fulke Greville and Sir Phillip Sidney, Mary Sidney, by then Countess of Pembroke, and Robert&#x27;s sister Penelope who inspired the &quot;Stella&quot; of Phillip Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Astrophel and Stella&quot; sonnet sequence.

Essex performed military service under his stepfather in the Netherlands, before making an impact at court and winning the queen&#x27;s favour. In 1590, he married Frances Walsingham, daughter of Sir Francis Walsingham and widow of Sir Philip Sidney, by whom he had several children, three of whom survived into adulthood. Elizabeth was against the marriage. Sidney, who was Leicester&#x27;s nephew, had died from an infected gun wound in 1586, 31 days after his participation in the Battle of Zutphen in which Essex had distinguished himself. In October 1591, Essex&#x27;s mistress, Elizabeth Southwell, gave birth to their son Walter Devereux (died 1641).

==Court and military career==
Devereux first came to court in 1584, and by 1587 had become a favourite of the queen, who relished his lively mind and eloquence, as well as his skills as a showman and in courtly love. In June 1587 he replaced the Earl of Leicester as Master of the Horse. After Leicester&#x27;s death in 1588, the queen transferred the late Earl&#x27;s royal monopoly on sweet wines to Essex, providing him with revenue from taxes. In 1593, he was made a member of her Privy Council.

It is reported that his friend and confidant Francis Bacon warned him to avoid offending the queen by attempting to gain power and underestimating her ability to rule and wield power.

Essex did underestimate the queen, however, and his later behaviour towards her lacked due respect and showed disdain for the influence of her principal secretary, Robert Cecil. On one occasion during a heated Privy Council debate on the problems in Ireland, the queen reportedly cuffed an insolent Essex round the ear, prompting him to half draw his sword on her.

In 1589, he took part in Francis Drake&#x27;s English Armada, which sailed to Spain in an unsuccessful attempt to press home the English advantage following the defeat of the Spanish Armada, but the queen had ordered him not to take part. The English Armada was defeated with 40 ships sunk and 15,000 men lost. In 1591, he was given command of a force sent to the assistance of King Henry IV of France. In 1596, he distinguished himself by the capture of Cádiz. During the Islands Voyage expedition to the Azores in 1597, with Walter Raleigh as his second-in-command, he defied the queen&#x27;s orders, pursuing the Spanish treasure fleet without first defeating the Spanish battle fleet.

When the 3rd Spanish Armada first appeared off the English coast in October 1597, the English fleet was far out to sea, with the coast almost undefended, and panic ensued. This further damaged the relationship between the queen and Essex, even though he was initially given full command of the English fleet when he reached England a few days later. Fortunately, a storm dispersed the Spanish fleet. A number of ships were captured by the English and though there were a few landings, the Spanish withdrew.

==Ireland==


Essex&#x27;s greatest failure was as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, a post which he talked himself into in 1599. The Nine Years&#x27; War (1595–1603) was in its middle stages, and no English commander had been successful. More military force was required to defeat the Irish chieftains, led by Hugh O&#x27;Neill, the Earl of Tyrone, and supplied from Spain and Scotland.

Essex led the largest expeditionary force ever sent to Ireland—16,000 troops—with orders to put an end to the rebellion. He departed London to the cheers of the queen&#x27;s subjects, and it was expected the rebellion would be crushed instantly, but the limits of Crown resources and of the Irish campaigning season dictated otherwise.

Essex had declared to the Privy Council that he would confront O&#x27;Neill in Ulster. Instead, he led his army into southern Ireland, where he fought a series of inconclusive engagements, wasted his funds, and dispersed his army into garrisons, while the Irish won two important battles in other parts of the country. Rather than face O&#x27;Neill in battle, Essex entered a truce that some considered humiliating to the Crown and to the detriment of English authority. The queen told Essex that if she had wished to abandon Ireland it would scarcely have been necessary to send him there.

In all of his campaigns, Essex secured the loyalty of his officers by conferring knighthoods, an honour the queen dispensed sparingly, and by the end of his time in Ireland more than half the knights in England owed their rank to him. The rebels were said to have joked that, &quot;he never drew sword but to make knights&quot;, but his practice of conferring knighthoods could in time enable Essex to challenge the powerful factions at Cecil&#x27;s command.

He was the second Chancellor of the University of Dublin, serving from 1598 to 1601. He was educated at Trinity College Dublin.

==First trial==
Relying on his general warrant to return to England, given under the great seal, Essex sailed from Ireland on 24 September 1599 and reached London four days later. The queen had expressly forbidden his return and was surprised when he presented himself in her bedchamber one morning at Nonsuch Palace, before she was properly wigged or gowned. On that day, the Privy Council met three times, and it seemed his disobedience might go unpunished, but the queen did confine him to his rooms with the comment that &quot;an unruly beast must be stopped of his provender.&quot;

Essex appeared before the full Council on 29 September, when he was compelled to stand before the council during a five-hour interrogation. The Council—his uncle William Knollys, 1st Earl of Banbury included—took a quarter of an hour to compile a report, which declared that his truce with O&#x27;Neill was indefensible and his flight from Ireland tantamount to the desertion of duty. He was committed to the custody of Sir Richard Berkeley in his own York House on 1 October, and he blamed Cecil and Raleigh for the queen&#x27;s hostility. Raleigh advised Cecil to see to it that Essex did not recover power, and Essex appeared to heed advice to retire from public life, despite his popularity with the public.

During his confinement at York House, Essex probably communicated with King James VI of Scotland through Lord Mountjoy, although any plans he may have had at that time to help the Scots king capture the English throne came to nothing. In October, Mountjoy was appointed to replace him in Ireland, and matters seemed to look up for the Earl. In November, the queen was reported to have said that the truce with O&#x27;Neill was &quot;so seasonably made... as great good... has grown by it.&quot; Others in the council were willing to justify Essex&#x27;s return from Ireland, on the grounds of the urgent necessity of a briefing by the commander-in-chief.

Cecil kept up the pressure and, on 5 June 1600, Essex was tried before a commission of 18 men. He had to hear the charges and evidence on his knees. Essex was convicted, deprived of public office, and returned to virtual confinement.

==Essex&#x27;s rebellion==

In August, his freedom was granted, but the source of his basic income—the sweet wines monopoly—was not renewed. His situation had become desperate, and he shifted &quot;from sorrow and repentance to rage and rebellion.&quot; In early 1601, he began to fortify Essex House, his town mansion on the Strand, and gathered his followers. 

On the morning of 8 February, he marched out of Essex House with a party of nobles and gentlemen (some later involved in the 1605 Gunpowder Plot) and entered the city of London in an attempt to force an audience with the queen. Cecil immediately had him proclaimed a traitor. 

A force under John Leveson placed a barrier across the street at Ludgate Hill. When Essex&#x27;s men tried to force their way through, Essex&#x27;s stepfather, Christopher Blount, was injured in the resulting skirmish, and Essex withdrew with his men to Essex House. Essex surrendered after Crown forces besieged Essex House.

==Treason trial and death==


On 19 February 1601, Essex was tried before his peers on charges of treason. Laura Hanes Cadwallader summarised the indictment:

Part of the evidence showed that he was in favour of toleration of religious dissent. In his own evidence, he countered the charge of dealing with Catholics, swearing that &quot;papists have been hired and suborned to witness against me.&quot; Essex also asserted that Cecil had stated that none in the world but the Infanta of Spain had right to the Crown of England, whereupon Cecil (who had been following the trial at a doorway concealed behind some tapestry) stepped out to make a dramatic denial, going down on his knees to give thanks to God for the opportunity. The witness whom Essex expected to confirm this allegation, his uncle William Knollys, was called and admitted there had once been read in Cecil&#x27;s presence a book treating such matters. The book may have been either &quot;The book of succession&quot; supposedly by R. Doleman but probably by Robert Persons or Persons&#x27; &quot;A Conference about the Next Succession to the Crown of England&quot;, works which favoured a Catholic successor friendly to Spain. Knollys denied hearing Cecil make the statement. Thanking God again, Cecil expressed his gratitude that Essex was exposed as a traitor while he was found an honest man.

Essex was found guilty and, on 25 February 1601, was beheaded on Tower Green, the last person to be beheaded in the Tower of London. It was reported to have taken three strokes by the executioner Thomas Derrick to complete the beheading. Previously Thomas Derrick had been convicted of rape but had been pardoned by the Earl of Essex (clearing him of the death penalty) on the condition that he become an executioner at Tyburn. At Sir Walter Raleigh&#x27;s own execution on 29 October 1618, it was alleged that Raleigh had said to a co-conspirator, &quot;Do not, as my Lord Essex did, take heed of a preacher. By his persuasion, he confessed, and made himself guilty.&quot; In that same trial, Raleigh also denied that he had stood at a window during the execution of Essex&#x27;s sentence, disdainfully puffing out tobacco smoke in sight of the condemned man. Essex in the end shocked many by denouncing his sister Penelope, Lady Rich as his co-conspirator: the queen, who was determined to show as much clemency as possible, ignored the charge.

Some days before the execution, Captain Thomas Lee was apprehended as he kept watch on the door to the queen&#x27;s chambers. His plan had been to confine her until she signed a warrant for the release of Essex. Captain Lee, who had served in Ireland with the Earl, and who acted as a go-between with the Ulster rebels, was tried and put to death the next day.

Essex&#x27;s conviction for treason meant that the earldom was forfeit and his son did not inherit the title. However, after the queen&#x27;s death, King James I of England reinstated the earldom in favour of the disinherited son, Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex.

===The Essex ring===

There is a widely repeated romantic legend about a ring given by Elizabeth to Essex. There is a possible reference to the legend by John Webster in his 1623 play &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Law Case&quot; suggesting that it was known at this time, but the first printed version of it is in the 1695 romantic novel &quot;The Secret History of the most renowned Queen Elizabeth and the Earl of Essex, by a Person of Quality&quot;. The version given by David Hume in his &quot;History of England&quot; says that Elizabeth had given Essex a ring after the expedition to Cádiz that he should send to her if he was in trouble. After his trial, he tried to send the ring to Elizabeth via the Countess of Nottingham, but the countess kept the ring because her husband was an enemy of Essex. As a result, Essex was executed. On her deathbed, the countess is said to have confessed this to Elizabeth, who angrily replied: &quot;May God forgive you, Madam, but I never can&quot;. The Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Galleries in Westminster Abbey possess a gold ring which is claimed to be this one.

Some historians consider this story of the ring to be a myth, partly because there are no contemporaneous accounts of it. John Lingard in his history of England says the story appears to be fiction. Lytton Strachey states &quot;Such a narrative is appropriate enough to the place where it was first fully elaborated—a sentimental novelette, but it does not belong to history&quot;, and Alison Weir calls it a fabrication.

Nevertheless, this version of the story forms the basis of the plot of Gaetano Donizetti&#x27;s opera &quot;Roberto Devereux&quot;, with a further twist added to the story, in that Essex is cheating on both the queen and his best friend by having an affair with Lady Nottingham (who in the opera is given the wrong first name of Sarah rather than Catherine): and that this turns out to be (a) the reason why Lord Nottingham turns against his now former friend, when he discovers the ring in question and prevents her sending it, and (b) is the ultimate reason for Queen Elizabeth withdrawing her support for Essex at his trial. The actual question of Devereux&#x27;s genuine guilt or innocence is sidelined (as is his actual failed rebellion), and the trial is presented as effectively a Parliamentary witch-hunt led by Cecil and Raleigh.

==Poetry==
Like many other Elizabethan aristocrats Essex was a competent lyric poet, who also participated in court entertainments. He engaged in literary as well as political feuds with his principal enemies, including Walter Raleigh. His poem &quot;&quot; attacks Raleigh&#x27;s influence over the queen.

Other lyrics were written for masques, including the sonnet &quot;&quot; in praise of the queen as the moral power linking Europe and America, who supports &quot;the world oppressed&quot; like the mythical Atlas. During his disgrace, he also wrote several bitter and pessimistic verses. His longest poem, &quot;&quot; (beginning &quot;From silent night...&quot;), is a penitential lament, probably written while imprisoned awaiting execution.

Several of Essex&#x27;s poems were set to music. English composer John Dowland set a poem called &quot;Can she excuse my wrongs with virtue&#x27;s cloak?&quot; in his 1597 publication &quot;First Booke of Songs&quot;: these lyrics have been attributed to Essex, largely on the basis of the dedication of &quot;The Earl of Essex&#x27;s Galliard&quot;, an instrumental version of the same song. Dowland also sets the opening verses of Essex&#x27;s poem &quot;The Passion of a Discontented Mind&quot; (&quot;From silent night&quot;) in his 1612 collection of songs. Orlando Gibbons set lines from the poem in the same year. Settings of Essex&#x27;s poems &quot;&quot; (set by Richard Martin) and &quot;&quot; (set by Daniel Bacheler) are published in &quot;A Musicall Banquet&quot; (1610), a collection of songs edited by Robert Dowland.

==Portrayals==
There have been many portrayals of Essex throughout the years:

===Opera===
* Saverio Mercadante&#x27;s 1833 opera &quot;Il Conte d&#x27;Essex&quot; with libretto by Felice Romani
* Gaetano Donizetti&#x27;s 1837 opera &quot;Roberto Devereux&quot; with libretto by Salvadore Cammarano based mainly on François Ancelot&#x27;s &quot;Elisabeth d&#x27;Angleterre&quot;.
* Benjamin Britten&#x27;s 1953 opera &quot;Gloriana&quot; is based on Lytton Strachey&#x27;s &quot;Elizabeth and Essex&quot;.

===Stage===
* In the 1956 essay &quot;Hamlet oder Hekuba: der Einbruch der Zeit in das Spiel&quot; (Hamlet or Hecuba: the Irruption of Time into the Play), the German legal theorist Carl Schmitt suggests that elements of the Earl&#x27;s biography, in particular his final days and last words, were incorporated into William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; at both the level of dialogue and the level of characterisation. Schmitt&#x27;s overall argument investigates the relationship between history and narrative generally.
* Essex is briefly alluded to in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot; at 5.0.22–34.
* Essex is said by editor David L. Stevenson to be alluded to in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; at 3.1.10–11.
* Gautier Coste de La Calprenède, &quot;Le Comte d&#x27;Essex&quot; (1639).
* Thomas Corneille, &quot;Le Comte d&#x27;Essex&quot; (1678).
* Claude Boyer, &quot;Le Comte d&#x27;Essex, tragedie. Par Monsieur Boyer de l&#x27;Academie françoise&quot; (1678).
* John Banks, &quot;The Unhappy Favourite; Or the Earl of Essex, a Tragedy&quot; (1682).
* The night of Essex&#x27;s execution is dramatised in the Timothy Findley play &quot;Elizabeth Rex&quot;.
* Essex is the love interest in &quot;La Reine Elizabeth&quot;, play by Émile Moreau, 1912, starring Sarah Bernhardt
* Maxwell Anderson&#x27;s 1930 play &quot;Elizabeth the Queen&quot; dramatised the queen&#x27;s relationship with Devereux, ending with his execution.

===Film===
* The 1939 film &quot;The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex&quot;, starring Bette Davis and Errol Flynn, is based on Anderson&#x27;s play and Lytton Strachey&#x27;s biographical account &quot;Elizabeth and Essex.&quot;
* Their relationship also provided material during the silent era, as in the 1912 film &quot;Les Amours de la reine Élisabeth&quot; (&quot;The Loves of Queen Elizabeth&quot;), with Sarah Bernhardt as the queen and Lou Tellegen as Essex.
* Essex was played by Sam Reid in the 2011 film &quot;Anonymous&quot;, a fictional biopic that posits that Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, was the true author of William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays and where both Essex and the Earl of Southampton are the illegitimate sons of Queen Elizabeth (the latter also being de Vere&#x27;s son who is stated by Robert Cecil to have been Elizabeth&#x27;s first bastard, making Southampton the product of incest)

===TV===
* Charlton Heston portrayed the Earl of Essex opposite Judith Anderson&#x27;s Elizabeth I in a 1968 television adaption of Maxwell Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Elizabeth the Queen&quot;, for the Hallmark Hall of Fame series.
* The Earl of Essex was portrayed by Robin Ellis in the fifth and sixth episodes of the BBC series &quot;Elizabeth R&quot; (1971) starring Glenda Jackson as Elizabeth I.
* The queen&#x27;s relationship with Essex (played by Hugh Dancy) and his stepfather Leicester (played by Jeremy Irons) was also covered by a 2005 Channel 4/HBO co-production &quot;Elizabeth I&quot;, starring Helen Mirren.
* In the 2005 &quot;The Virgin Queen&quot;, Hans Matheson played the ill-fated Earl of Essex.
* In the 2017 BBC documentary mini-series &quot;Elizabeth I&#x27;s Secret Agents&quot;, the Earl of Essex was portrayed by Joe Wredden.

=== Video game ===

* He is voiced by Rich Keeble in the video game &quot;Astrologaster&quot;.

==Essex in literature==
The best known biographical work about Robert Devereux is Lytton Strachey&#x27;s masterpiece &quot;Elizabeth and Essex&quot;.

At least two fencing treatises are dedicated to Robert, Earl of Essex. They are as follows:
* Vincentio Saviolo – &quot;His Practice&quot; (1595)
* George Silver – &quot;Paradoxes of Defence&quot; (1599)

Robert Devereux&#x27;s death and confession became the subject of two popular 17th-century broadside ballads, set to the English folk tunes &quot;Essex Last Goodnight&quot; and &quot;Welladay&quot;. Numerous ballads lamenting his death and praising his military feats were also published throughout the 17th century.

<doc id="50903" wikidata="Q831390" url="?curid=50903" title="Wavelet">
<text>A wavelet is a wave-like oscillation with an amplitude that begins at zero, increases or decreases, and then returns to zero one or more times. Wavelets are termed a &quot;brief oscillation&quot;. A taxonomy of wavelets has been established, based on the number and direction of its pulses. Wavelets are imbued with specific properties that make them useful for signal processing.
For example, a wavelet could be created to have a frequency of middle C and a short duration of roughly one tenth of a second. If this wavelet were to be convolved with a signal created from the recording of a melody, then the resulting signal would be useful for determining when the middle C note appeared in the song. Mathematically, a wavelet correlates with a signal if a portion of the signal is similar. Correlation is at the core of many practical wavelet applications.

As a mathematical tool, wavelets can be used to extract information from many kinds of data, including audio signals and images. Sets of wavelets are needed to analyze data fully. &quot;Complementary&quot; wavelets decompose a signal without gaps or overlaps so that the decomposition process is mathematically reversible. Thus, sets of complementary wavelets are useful in wavelet-based compression/decompression algorithms, where it is desirable to recover the original information with minimal loss.

In formal terms, this representation is a wavelet series representation of a square-integrable function with respect to either a complete, orthonormal set of basis functions, or an overcomplete set or frame of a vector space, for the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions. This is accomplished through coherent states.

In classical physics, the diffraction phenomenon is described by the Huygens–Fresnel principle that treats each point in a propagating wavefront as a collection of individual spherical wavelets. The characteristic bending pattern is most pronounced when a wave from a coherent source (such as a laser) encounters a slit/aperture that is comparable in size to its wavelength. This is due to the addition, or interference, of different points on the wavefront (or, equivalently, each wavelet) that travel by paths of different lengths to the registering surface. Multiple, closely spaced openings (e.g., a diffraction grating), can result in a complex pattern of varying intensity.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;wavelet&quot; has been used for decades in digital signal processing and exploration geophysics. The equivalent French word &quot;ondelette&quot; meaning &quot;small wave&quot; was used by Jean Morlet and Alex Grossmann in the early 1980s.

== Wavelet theory ==

Wavelet theory is applicable to several subjects. All wavelet transforms may be considered forms of time-frequency representation for continuous-time (analog) signals and so are related to harmonic analysis. Discrete wavelet transform (continuous in time) of a discrete-time (sampled) signal by using discrete-time filterbanks of dyadic (octave band) configuration is a wavelet approximation to that signal. The coefficients of such a filter bank are called the shift and scaling coefficients in wavelets nomenclature. These filterbanks may contain either finite impulse response (FIR) or infinite impulse response (IIR) filters. The wavelets forming a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) are subject to the uncertainty principle of Fourier analysis respective sampling theory: given a signal with some event in it, one cannot assign simultaneously an exact time and frequency response scale to that event. The product of the uncertainties of time and frequency response scale has a lower bound. Thus, in the scaleogram of a continuous wavelet transform of this signal, such an event marks an entire region in the time-scale plane, instead of just one point. Also, discrete wavelet bases may be considered in the context of other forms of the uncertainty principle.

Wavelet transforms are broadly divided into three classes: continuous, discrete and multiresolution-based.

=== Continuous wavelet transforms (continuous shift and scale parameters) ===
In continuous wavelet transforms, a given signal of finite energy is projected on a continuous family of frequency bands (or similar subspaces of the &quot;Lp&quot; function space &quot;L&quot;2(R) ). For instance the signal may be represented on every frequency band of the form [&quot;f&quot;, 2&quot;f&quot;] for all positive frequencies &quot;f&quot; &gt; 0. Then, the original signal can be reconstructed by a suitable integration over all the resulting frequency components.

The frequency bands or subspaces (sub-bands) are scaled versions of a subspace at scale 1. This subspace in turn is in most situations generated by the shifts of one generating function ψ in &quot;L&quot;2(R), the &quot;mother wavelet&quot;. For the example of the scale one frequency band [1, 2] this function is
formula_1
with the (normalized) sinc function. That, Meyer&#x27;s, and two other examples of mother wavelets are:

The subspace of scale &quot;a&quot; or frequency band [1/&quot;a&quot;, 2/&quot;a&quot;] is generated by the functions (sometimes called &quot;child wavelets&quot;)
formula_2
where &quot;a&quot; is positive and defines the scale and &quot;b&quot; is any real number and defines the shift. The pair (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) defines a point in the right halfplane R+ × R.

The projection of a function &quot;x&quot; onto the subspace of scale &quot;a&quot; then has the form
formula_3
with &quot;wavelet coefficients&quot;
formula_4

For the analysis of the signal &quot;x&quot;, one can assemble the wavelet coefficients into a scaleogram of the signal.

See a list of some Continuous wavelets.

=== Discrete wavelet transforms (discrete shift and scale parameters, continuous in time) ===
It is computationally impossible to analyze a signal using all wavelet coefficients, so one may wonder if it is sufficient to pick a discrete subset of the upper halfplane to be able to reconstruct a signal from the corresponding wavelet coefficients. One such system is the affine system for some real parameters &quot;a&quot; &gt; 1, &quot;b&quot; &gt; 0. The corresponding discrete subset of the halfplane consists of all the points (&quot;am&quot;, &quot;nb am&quot;) with &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot; in Z. The corresponding &quot;child wavelets&quot; are now given as
formula_5

A sufficient condition for the reconstruction of any signal &quot;x&quot; of finite energy by the formula
formula_6
is that the functions formula_7 form an orthonormal basis of &quot;L&quot;2(R).

=== Multiresolution based discrete wavelet transforms (continuous in time)===
In any discretised wavelet transform, there are only a finite number of wavelet coefficients for each bounded rectangular region in the upper halfplane. Still, each coefficient requires the evaluation of an integral. In special situations this numerical complexity can be avoided if the scaled and shifted wavelets form a multiresolution analysis. This means that there has to exist an auxiliary function, the &quot;father wavelet&quot; φ in &quot;L&quot;2(R), and that &quot;a&quot; is an integer. A typical choice is &quot;a&quot; = 2 and &quot;b&quot; = 1. The most famous pair of father and mother wavelets is the Daubechies 4-tap wavelet. Note that not every orthonormal discrete wavelet basis can be associated to a multiresolution analysis; for example, the Journe wavelet admits no multiresolution analysis.

From the mother and father wavelets one constructs the subspaces
formula_8
formula_9
The father wavelet formula_10 keeps the time domain properties, while the mother wavelets formula_11 keeps the frequency domain properties.

From these it is required that the sequence
formula_12
forms a multiresolution analysis of &quot;L2&quot; and that the subspaces formula_13 are the orthogonal &quot;differences&quot; of the above sequence, that is, &quot;Wm&quot; is the orthogonal complement of &quot;Vm&quot; inside the subspace &quot;V&quot;&quot;m&quot;−1,
formula_14

In analogy to the sampling theorem one may conclude that the space &quot;Vm&quot; with sampling distance 2&quot;m&quot; more or less covers the frequency baseband from 0 to 1/2&quot;m&quot;-1. As orthogonal complement, &quot;Wm&quot; roughly covers the band [1/2&quot;m&quot;−1, 1/2&quot;m&quot;].

From those inclusions and orthogonality relations, especially formula_15, follows the existence of sequences formula_16 and formula_17 that satisfy the identities
formula_18 so that formula_19 and
formula_20 so that formula_21
The second identity of the first pair is a refinement equation for the father wavelet φ. Both pairs of identities form the basis for the algorithm of the fast wavelet transform.

From the multiresolution analysis derives the orthogonal decomposition of the space &quot;L&quot;2 as
formula_22
For any signal or function formula_23 this gives a representation in basis functions of the corresponding subspaces as
formula_24
where the coefficients are
formula_25 and
formula_26

===Time-causal wavelets===

For processing temporal signals in real time, it is essential that the wavelet filters do not access signal values from the future as well as that minimal temporal latencies can be obtained. Time-causal wavelets representations have been developed by Szu et al and Lindeberg, with the latter method also involving a memory-efficient time-recursive implementation.

== Mother wavelet ==
For practical applications, and for efficiency reasons, one prefers continuously differentiable functions with compact support as mother (prototype) wavelet (functions). However, to satisfy analytical requirements (in the continuous WT) and in general for theoretical reasons, one chooses the wavelet functions from a subspace of the space formula_27 This is the space of Lebesgue measurable functions that are both absolutely integrable and square integrable in the sense that
formula_28 and formula_29

Being in this space ensures that one can formulate the conditions of zero mean and square norm one:
formula_30 is the condition for zero mean, and
formula_31 is the condition for square norm one.

For &quot;ψ&quot; to be a wavelet for the continuous wavelet transform (see there for exact statement), the mother wavelet must satisfy an admissibility criterion (loosely speaking, a kind of half-differentiability) in order to get a stably invertible transform.

For the discrete wavelet transform, one needs at least the condition that the wavelet series is a representation of the identity in the space &quot;L&quot;2(R). Most constructions of discrete WT make use of the multiresolution analysis, which defines the wavelet by a scaling function. This scaling function itself is a solution to a functional equation.

In most situations it is useful to restrict ψ to be a continuous function with a higher number &quot;M&quot; of vanishing moments, i.e. for all integer &quot;m&quot; &lt; &quot;M&quot;
formula_32

The mother wavelet is scaled (or dilated) by a factor of &quot;a&quot; and translated (or shifted) by a factor of &quot;b&quot; to give (under Morlet&#x27;s original formulation):

formula_33

For the continuous WT, the pair (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;) varies over the full half-plane R+ × R; for the discrete WT this pair varies over a discrete subset of it, which is also called &quot;affine group&quot;.

These functions are often incorrectly referred to as the basis functions of the (continuous) transform. In fact, as in the continuous Fourier transform, there is no basis in the continuous wavelet transform. Time-frequency interpretation uses a subtly different formulation (after Delprat).

Restriction：
# formula_34 when and ,
# formula_35 has a finite time interval

== Comparisons with Fourier transform (continuous-time) ==
The wavelet transform is often compared with the Fourier transform, in which signals are represented as a sum of sinusoids. In fact, the Fourier transform can be viewed as a special case of the continuous wavelet transform with the choice of the mother wavelet
formula_36.
The main difference in general is that wavelets are localized in both time and frequency whereas the standard Fourier transform is only localized in frequency. The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is similar to the wavelet transform, in that it is also time and frequency localized, but there are issues with the frequency/time resolution trade-off.

In particular, assuming a rectangular window region, one may think of the STFT as a transform with a slightly different kernel
formula_37
where formula_38 can often be written as formula_39, where formula_40 and &quot;u&quot; respectively denote the length and temporal offset of the windowing function. Using Parseval&#x27;s theorem, one may define the wavelet&#x27;s energy as
formula_41
From this, the square of the temporal support of the window offset by time &quot;u&quot; is given by
formula_42

and the square of the spectral support of the window acting on a frequency formula_43
formula_44

Multiplication with a rectangular window in the time domain corresponds to convolution with a formula_45 function in the frequency domain, resulting in spurious ringing artifacts for short/localized temporal windows. With the continuous-time Fourier transform, formula_46 and this convolution is with a delta function in Fourier space, resulting in the true Fourier transform of the signal formula_47. The window function may be some other apodizing filter, such as a Gaussian. The choice of windowing function will affect the approximation error relative to the true Fourier transform.

A given resolution cell&#x27;s time-bandwidth product may not be exceeded with the STFT. All STFT basis elements maintain a uniform spectral and temporal support for all temporal shifts or offsets, thereby attaining an equal resolution in time for lower and higher frequencies. The resolution is purely determined by the sampling width.

In contrast, the wavelet transform&#x27;s multiresolutional properties enables large temporal supports for lower frequencies while maintaining short temporal widths for higher frequencies by the scaling properties of the wavelet transform. This property extends conventional time-frequency analysis into time-scale analysis. 

The discrete wavelet transform is less computationally complex, taking O(&quot;N&quot;) time as compared to O(&quot;N&quot; log &quot;N&quot;) for the fast Fourier transform (FFT). This computational advantage is not inherent to the transform, but reflects the choice of a logarithmic division of frequency, in contrast to the equally spaced frequency divisions of the FFT which uses the same basis functions as the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). This complexity only applies when the filter size has no relation to the signal size. A wavelet without compact support such as the Shannon wavelet would require O(&quot;N&quot;2). (For instance, a logarithmic Fourier Transform also exists with O(&quot;N&quot;) complexity, but the original signal must be sampled logarithmically in time, which is only useful for certain types of signals.)

== Definition of a wavelet ==
A wavelet (or a wavelet family) can be defined in various ways:

=== Scaling filter ===
An orthogonal wavelet is entirely defined by the scaling filter – a low-pass finite impulse response (FIR) filter of length 2&quot;N&quot; and sum 1. In biorthogonal wavelets, separate decomposition and reconstruction filters are defined.

For analysis with orthogonal wavelets the high pass filter is calculated as the quadrature mirror filter of the low pass, and reconstruction filters are the time reverse of the decomposition filters.

Daubechies and Symlet wavelets can be defined by the scaling filter.

=== Scaling function ===
Wavelets are defined by the wavelet function ψ(&quot;t&quot;) (i.e. the mother wavelet) and scaling function φ(&quot;t&quot;) (also called father wavelet) in the time domain.

The wavelet function is in effect a band-pass filter and scaling that for each level halves its bandwidth. This creates the problem that in order to cover the entire spectrum, an infinite number of levels would be required. The scaling function filters the lowest level of the transform and ensures all the spectrum is covered. See for a detailed explanation.

For a wavelet with compact support, φ(&quot;t&quot;) can be considered finite in length and is equivalent to the scaling filter &quot;g&quot;.

Meyer wavelets can be defined by scaling functions

=== Wavelet function ===
The wavelet only has a time domain representation as the wavelet function ψ(&quot;t&quot;).

For instance, Mexican hat wavelets can be defined by a wavelet function. See a list of a few continuous wavelets.

== History ==
The development of wavelets can be linked to several separate trains of thought, starting with Alfréd Haar&#x27;s work in the early 20th century. Later work by Dennis Gabor yielded Gabor atoms (1946), which are constructed similarly to wavelets, and applied to similar purposes.

Notable contributions to wavelet theory since then can be attributed to George Zweig’s discovery of the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) in 1975 (originally called the cochlear transform and discovered while studying the reaction of the ear to sound), Pierre Goupillaud, Alex Grossmann and Jean Morlet&#x27;s formulation of what is now known as the CWT (1982), Jan-Olov Strömberg&#x27;s early work on discrete wavelets (1983), the Le Gall–Tabatabai (LGT) 5/3-taps non-orthogonal filter bank with linear phase (1988), Ingrid Daubechies&#x27; orthogonal wavelets with compact support (1988), Stéphane Mallat&#x27;s non-orthogonal multiresolution framework (1989), Ali Akansu&#x27;s binomial QMF (1990), Nathalie Delprat&#x27;s time-frequency interpretation of the CWT (1991), Newland&#x27;s harmonic wavelet transform (1993), and set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) developed by Amir Said with William A. Pearlman in 1996.

The JPEG 2000 standard was developed from 1997 to 2000 by a Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) committee chaired by Touradj Ebrahimi (later the JPEG president). In contrast to the DCT algorithm used by the original JPEG format, JPEG 2000 instead uses discrete wavelet transform (DWT) algorithms. It uses the CDF 9/7 wavelet transform (developed by Ingrid Daubechies in 1992) for its lossy compression algorithm, and the Le Gall–Tabatabai (LGT) 5/3 discrete-time filter bank (developed by Didier Le Gall and Ali J. Tabatabai in 1988) for its lossless compression algorithm. JPEG 2000 technology, which includes the Motion JPEG 2000 extension, was selected as the video coding standard for digital cinema in 2004.

== Wavelet transforms ==

A wavelet is a mathematical function used to divide a given function or continuous-time signal into different scale components. Usually one can assign a frequency range to each scale component. Each scale component can then be studied with a resolution that matches its scale. A wavelet transform is the representation of a function by wavelets. The wavelets are scaled and translated copies (known as &quot;daughter wavelets&quot;) of a finite-length or fast-decaying oscillating waveform (known as the &quot;mother wavelet&quot;). Wavelet transforms have advantages over traditional Fourier transforms for representing functions that have discontinuities and sharp peaks, and for accurately deconstructing and reconstructing finite, non-periodic and/or non-stationary signals.

Wavelet transforms are classified into discrete wavelet transforms (DWTs) and continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs). Note that both DWT and CWT are continuous-time (analog) transforms. They can be used to represent continuous-time (analog) signals. CWTs operate over every possible scale and translation whereas DWTs use a specific subset of scale and translation values or representation grid.

There are a large number of wavelet transforms each suitable for different applications. For a full list see list of wavelet-related transforms but the common ones are listed below:
* Continuous wavelet transform (CWT)
* Discrete wavelet transform (DWT)
* Fast wavelet transform (FWT)
* Lifting scheme and generalized lifting scheme
* Wavelet packet decomposition (WPD)
* Stationary wavelet transform (SWT)
* Fractional Fourier transform (FRFT)
* Fractional wavelet transform (FRWT)

=== Generalized transforms ===
There are a number of generalized transforms of which the wavelet transform is a special case. For example, Yosef Joseph introduced scale into the Heisenberg group, giving rise to a continuous transform space that is a function of time, scale, and frequency. The CWT is a two-dimensional slice through the resulting 3d time-scale-frequency volume.

Another example of a generalized transform is the chirplet transform in which the CWT is also a two dimensional slice through the chirplet transform.

An important application area for generalized transforms involves systems in which high frequency resolution is crucial. For example, darkfield electron optical transforms intermediate between direct and reciprocal space have been widely used in the harmonic analysis of atom clustering, i.e. in the study of crystals and crystal defects. Now that transmission electron microscopes are capable of providing digital images with picometer-scale information on atomic periodicity in nanostructure of all sorts, the range of pattern recognition and strain/metrology applications for intermediate transforms with high frequency resolution (like brushlets and ridgelets) is growing rapidly.

Fractional wavelet transform (FRWT) is a generalization of the classical wavelet transform in the fractional Fourier transform domains. This transform is capable of providing the time- and fractional-domain information simultaneously and representing signals in the time-fractional-frequency plane.

== Applications ==
Generally, an approximation to DWT is used for data compression if a signal is already sampled, and the CWT for signal analysis. Thus, DWT approximation is commonly used in engineering and computer science, and the CWT in scientific research.

Like some other transforms, wavelet transforms can be used to transform data, then encode the transformed data, resulting in effective compression. For example, JPEG 2000 is an image compression standard that uses biorthogonal wavelets. This means that although the frame is overcomplete, it is a &quot;tight frame&quot; (see types of frames of a vector space), and the same frame functions (except for conjugation in the case of complex wavelets) are used for both analysis and synthesis, i.e., in both the forward and inverse transform. For details see wavelet compression.

A related use is for smoothing/denoising data based on wavelet coefficient thresholding, also called wavelet shrinkage. By adaptively thresholding the wavelet coefficients that correspond to undesired frequency components smoothing and/or denoising operations can be performed.

Wavelet transforms are also starting to be used for communication applications. Wavelet OFDM is the basic modulation scheme used in HD-PLC (a power line communications technology developed by Panasonic), and in one of the optional modes included in the IEEE 1901 standard. Wavelet OFDM can achieve deeper notches than traditional FFT OFDM, and wavelet OFDM does not require a guard interval (which usually represents significant overhead in FFT OFDM systems).

=== As a representation of a signal ===

Often, signals can be represented well as a sum of sinusoids. However, consider a non-continuous signal with an abrupt discontinuity; this signal can still be represented as a sum of sinusoids, but requires an infinite number, which is an observation known as Gibbs phenomenon. This, then, requires an infinite number of Fourier coefficients, which is not practical for many applications, such as compression. Wavelets are more useful for describing these signals with discontinuities because of their time-localized behavior (both Fourier and wavelet transforms are frequency-localized, but wavelets have an additional time-localization property). Because of this, many types of signals in practice may be non-sparse in the Fourier domain, but very sparse in the wavelet domain. This is particularly useful in signal reconstruction, especially in the recently popular field of compressed sensing. (Note that the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is also localized in time and frequency, but there are often problems with the frequency-time resolution trade-off. Wavelets are better signal representations because of multiresolution analysis.)

This motivates why wavelet transforms are now being adopted for a vast number of applications, often replacing the conventional Fourier transform. Many areas of physics have seen this paradigm shift, including molecular dynamics, chaos theory, ab initio calculations, astrophysics, gravitational wave transient data analysis, density-matrix localisation, seismology, optics, turbulence and quantum mechanics. This change has also occurred in image processing, EEG, EMG, ECG analyses, brain rhythms, DNA analysis, protein analysis, climatology, human sexual response analysis, general signal processing, speech recognition, acoustics, vibration signals, computer graphics, multifractal analysis, and sparse coding. In computer vision and image processing, the notion of scale space representation and Gaussian derivative operators is regarded as a canonical multi-scale representation.

=== Wavelet denoising ===

Suppose we measure a noisy signal formula_48, where formula_49 represents the signal and formula_50 represents the noise. Assume formula_49 has a sparse representation in a certain wavelet basis, and formula_52

Let the wavelet transform of formula_53 be formula_54, where formula_55 is the wavelet transform of the signal component and formula_56 is the wavelet transform of the noise component.

Most elements in formula_57 are 0 or close to 0, and formula_58

Since formula_59 is orthogonal, the estimation problem amounts to recovery of a signal in iid Gaussian noise. As formula_57 is sparse, one method is to apply a Gaussian mixture model for formula_57.

Assume a prior formula_62, where formula_63 is the variance of &quot;significant&quot; coefficients and formula_64 is the variance of &quot;insignificant&quot; coefficients.

Then formula_65, formula_66 is called the shrinkage factor, which depends on the prior variances formula_63 and formula_64. By setting coefficients that fall below a shrinkage threshold to zero, once the inverse transform is applied, an expectedly small amount of signal is lost due to the sparsity assumption. The larger coefficients are expected to primarily represent signal due to sparsity, and statistically very little of the signal, albeit the majority of the noise, is expected to be represented in such lower magnitude coefficients... therefore the zeroing-out operation is expected to remove most of the noise and not much signal. Typically, the above-threshold coefficients are not modified during this process. Some algorithms for wavelet-based denoising may attenuate larger coefficients as well, based on a statistical estimate of the amount of noise expected to be removed by such an attenuation.

At last, apply the inverse wavelet transform to obtain formula_69

=== Multiscale climate network ===

Agarwal et al. proposed wavelet based advanced linear and nonlinear methods to construct and investigate Climate as complex networks at different timescales. Climate networks constructed using SST datasets at different timescale averred that wavelet based multi-scale analysis of climatic processes holds the promise of better understanding the system dynamics that may be missed when processes are analyzed at one timescale only

<text>In mathematics, the Haar wavelet is a sequence of rescaled &quot;square-shaped&quot; functions which together form a wavelet family or basis. Wavelet analysis is similar to Fourier analysis in that it allows a target function over an interval to be represented in terms of an orthonormal basis. The Haar sequence is now recognised as the first known wavelet basis and is extensively used as a teaching example.

The Haar sequence was proposed in 1909 by Alfréd Haar. 
Haar used these functions to give an example of an orthonormal system for the space of square-integrable functions on the unit interval [0, 1]. The study of wavelets, and even the term &quot;wavelet&quot;, did not come until much later. As a special case of the Daubechies wavelet, the Haar wavelet is also known as Db1.

The Haar wavelet is also the simplest possible wavelet. The technical disadvantage of the Haar wavelet is that it is not continuous, and therefore not differentiable. This property can, however, be an advantage for the analysis of signals with sudden transitions (discrete signals), such as monitoring of tool failure in machines.

The Haar wavelet&#x27;s mother wavelet function formula_1 can be described as
: formula_2

Its scaling function formula_3 can be described as
: formula_4

== Haar functions and Haar system ==
For every pair &quot;n&quot;, &quot;k&quot; of integers in formula_5, the Haar function &quot;ψ&quot;&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot; is defined on the real line formula_6 by the formula
:formula_7
This function is supported on the right-open interval , &quot;i.e.&quot;, it vanishes outside that interval. It has integral 0 and norm 1 in the Hilbert space &quot;L&quot;2(formula_6),
:formula_9
The Haar functions are pairwise orthogonal,
:formula_10
where formula_11 represents the Kronecker delta. Here is the reason for orthogonality: when the two supporting intervals formula_12 and formula_13 are not equal, then they are either disjoint, or else the smaller of the two supports, say formula_12, is contained in the lower or in the upper half of the other interval, on which the function formula_15 remains constant. It follows in this case that the product of these two Haar functions is a multiple of the first Haar function, hence the product has integral 0.

The Haar system on the real line is the set of functions
:formula_16
It is complete in &quot;L&quot;2(formula_6): &quot;The Haar system on the line is an orthonormal basis in&quot; &quot;L&quot;2(formula_6).

==Haar wavelet properties==
The Haar wavelet has several notable properties:


== Haar system on the unit interval and related systems ==
In this section, the discussion is restricted to the unit interval [0, 1] and to the Haar functions that are supported on [0, 1]. The system of functions considered by Haar in 1910,
called the Haar system on [0, 1] in this article, consists of the subset of Haar wavelets defined as
:formula_19
with the addition of the constant function 1 on [0, 1].

In Hilbert space terms, this Haar system on [0, 1] is a complete orthonormal system, &quot;i.e.&quot;, an orthonormal basis, for the space &quot;L&quot;2([0, 1]) of square integrable functions on the unit interval.

The Haar system on [0, 1] —with the constant function 1 as first element, followed with the Haar functions ordered according to the lexicographic ordering of couples — is further a monotone Schauder basis for the space &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot;([0, 1]) when . 
This basis is unconditional when .

There is a related Rademacher system consisting of sums of Haar functions, 
:formula_20
Notice that |&quot;r&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;t&quot;)| = 1 on [0, 1). This is an orthonormal system but it is not complete.
In the language of probability theory, the Rademacher sequence is an instance of a sequence of independent Bernoulli random variables with mean 0. The Khintchine inequality expresses the fact that in all the spaces &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot;([0, 1]), , the Rademacher sequence is equivalent to the unit vector basis in ℓ&quot;2&quot;. In particular, the closed linear span of the Rademacher sequence in &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot;([0, 1]), , is isomorphic to ℓ&quot;2&quot;.

=== The Faber–Schauder system ===
The Faber–Schauder system 
is the family of continuous functions on [0, 1] consisting of the constant function 1, and of multiples of indefinite integrals of the functions in the Haar system on [0, 1], chosen to have norm 1 in the maximum norm. This system begins with &quot;s&quot;0 = 1, then is the indefinite integral vanishing at 0 of the function 1, first element of the Haar system on [0, 1]. Next, for every integer , functions are defined by the formula
:formula_21
These functions are continuous, piecewise linear, supported by the interval that also supports . The function is equal to 1 at the midpoint of the interval , linear on both halves of that interval. It takes values between 0 and 1 everywhere.

The Faber–Schauder system is a Schauder basis for the space &quot;C&quot;([0, 1]) of continuous functions on [0, 1]. 
For every &quot;f&quot; in &quot;C&quot;([0, 1]), the partial sum
:formula_22
of the series expansion of &quot;f&quot; in the Faber–Schauder system is the continuous piecewise linear function that agrees with &quot;f&quot; at the points , where . Next, the formula
:formula_23
gives a way to compute the expansion of &quot;f&quot; step by step. Since &quot;f&quot; is uniformly continuous, the sequence {&quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot;} converges uniformly to &quot;f&quot;. It follows that the Faber–Schauder series expansion of &quot;f&quot; converges in &quot;C&quot;([0, 1]), and the sum of this series is equal to &quot;f&quot;.

=== The Franklin system ===
The Franklin system is obtained from the Faber–Schauder system by the Gram–Schmidt orthonormalization procedure.
Since the Franklin system has the same linear span as that of the Faber–Schauder system, this span is dense in &quot;C&quot;([0, 1]), hence in &quot;L&quot;2([0, 1]). The Franklin system is therefore an orthonormal basis for &quot;L&quot;2([0, 1]), consisting of continuous piecewise linear functions. P. Franklin proved in 1928 that this system is a Schauder basis for &quot;C&quot;([0, 1]). 
The Franklin system is also an unconditional Schauder basis for the space &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot;([0, 1]) when .
The Franklin system provides a Schauder basis in the disk algebra &quot;A&quot;(&quot;D&quot;).
This was proved in 1974 by Bočkarev, after the existence of a basis for the disk algebra had remained open for more than forty years.

Bočkarev&#x27;s construction of a Schauder basis in &quot;A&quot;(&quot;D&quot;) goes as follows: let &quot;f&quot; be a complex valued Lipschitz function on [0, π]; then &quot;f&quot; is the sum of a cosine series with absolutely summable coefficients. Let &quot;T&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) be the element of &quot;A&quot;(&quot;D&quot;) defined by the complex power series with the same coefficients,

:formula_24
Bočkarev&#x27;s basis for &quot;A&quot;(&quot;D&quot;) is formed by the images under &quot;T&quot; of the functions in the Franklin system on [0, π]. Bočkarev&#x27;s equivalent description for the mapping &quot;T&quot; starts by extending &quot;f&quot; to an even Lipschitz function &quot;g&quot;1 on [−π, π], identified with a Lipschitz function on the unit circle T. Next, let &quot;g&quot;2 be the conjugate function of &quot;g&quot;1, and define &quot;T&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) to be the function in &quot;A&quot;(&quot;D&quot;) whose value on the boundary T of &quot;D&quot; is equal to .

When dealing with 1-periodic continuous functions, or rather with continuous functions &quot;f&quot; on [0, 1] such that , one removes the function from the Faber–Schauder system, in order to obtain the periodic Faber–Schauder system. The periodic Franklin system is obtained by orthonormalization from the periodic Faber–-Schauder system.
One can prove Bočkarev&#x27;s result on &quot;A&quot;(&quot;D&quot;) by proving that the periodic Franklin system on [0, 2π] is a basis for a Banach space &quot;A&quot;&quot;r&quot; isomorphic to &quot;A&quot;(&quot;D&quot;). 
The space &quot;A&quot;&quot;r&quot; consists of complex continuous functions on the unit circle T whose conjugate function is also continuous.

==Haar matrix==
The 2×2 Haar matrix that is associated with the Haar wavelet is
: formula_25
Using the discrete wavelet transform, one can transform any sequence formula_26 of even length into a sequence of two-component-vectors formula_27. If one right-multiplies each vector with the matrix formula_28, one gets the result formula_29 of one stage of the fast Haar-wavelet transform. Usually one separates the sequences &quot;s&quot; and &quot;d&quot; and continues with transforming the sequence &quot;s&quot;. Sequence &quot;s&quot; is often referred to as the &quot;averages&quot; part, whereas &quot;d&quot; is known as the &quot;details&quot; part.

If one has a sequence of length a multiple of four, one can build blocks of 4 elements and transform them in a similar manner with the 4×4 Haar matrix
: formula_30
which combines two stages of the fast Haar-wavelet transform.

Compare with a Walsh matrix, which is a non-localized 1/–1 matrix.

Generally, the 2N×2N Haar matrix can be derived by the following equation.

: formula_31
:where formula_32 and formula_33 is the Kronecker product.

The Kronecker product of formula_34, where formula_35 is an m×n matrix and formula_36 is a p×q matrix, is expressed as

: formula_37

An un-normalized 8-point Haar matrix formula_38 is shown below

: formula_39

Note that, the above matrix is an un-normalized Haar matrix. The Haar matrix required by the Haar transform should be normalized.

From the definition of the Haar matrix formula_40, one can observe that, unlike the Fourier transform, formula_40 has only real elements (i.e., 1, -1 or 0) and is non-symmetric.

Take the 8-point Haar matrix formula_38 as an example. The first row of formula_38 measures the average value, and the second row of formula_38 measures a low frequency component of the input vector. The next two rows are sensitive to the first and second half of the input vector respectively, which corresponds to moderate frequency components. The remaining four rows are sensitive to the four section of the input vector, which corresponds to high frequency components.

==Haar transform==
The Haar transform is the simplest of the wavelet transforms. This transform cross-multiplies a function against the Haar wavelet with various shifts and stretches, like the Fourier transform cross-multiplies a function against a sine wave with two phases and many stretches.

=== Introduction ===
The Haar transform is one of the oldest transform functions, proposed in 1910 by the Hungarian mathematician Alfréd Haar. It is found effective in applications such as signal and image compression in electrical and computer engineering as it provides a simple and computationally efficient approach for analysing the local aspects of a signal.

The Haar transform is derived from the Haar matrix. An example of a 4×4 Haar transformation matrix is shown below.

:formula_45

The Haar transform can be thought of as a sampling process in which rows of the transformation matrix act as samples of finer and finer resolution.

Compare with the Walsh transform, which is also 1/–1, but is non-localized.

=== Property ===
The Haar transform has the following properties

# No need for multiplications. It requires only additions and there are many elements with zero value in the Haar matrix, so the computation time is short. It is faster than Walsh transform, whose matrix is composed of +1 and −1.
# Input and output length are the same. However, the length should be a power of 2, i.e. formula_46.
# It can be used to analyse the localized feature of signals. Due to the orthogonal property of the Haar function, the frequency components of input signal can be analyzed.

=== Haar transform and Inverse Haar transform ===
The Haar transform &quot;y&quot;&quot;n&quot; of an n-input function &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; is

: formula_47

The Haar transform matrix is real and orthogonal. Thus, the inverse Haar transform can be derived by the following equations.

: formula_48

: where formula_49 is the identity matrix. For example, when n = 4

: formula_50

Thus, the inverse Haar transform is

: formula_51

=== Example ===
The Haar transform coefficients of a n=4-point signal formula_52 can be found as

: formula_53

The input signal can then be perfectly reconstructed by the inverse Haar transform

: formula_54

<doc id="50907" wikidata="Q6571111" url="?curid=50907" title="List of Fourier-related transforms">
<text>This is a list of linear transformations of functions related to Fourier analysis. Such transformations map a function to a set of coefficients of basis functions, where the basis functions are sinusoidal and are therefore strongly localized in the frequency spectrum. (These transforms are generally designed to be invertible.) In the case of the Fourier transform, each basis function corresponds to a single frequency component.

==Continuous transforms==
Applied to functions of continuous arguments, Fourier-related transforms include:
* Two-sided Laplace transform
* Mellin transform, another closely related integral transform
* Laplace transform: the Fourier transform may be considered a special case of the imaginary axis of the bilateral Laplace transform
* Fourier transform, with special cases:
** Fourier series 
*** When the input function/waveform is periodic, the Fourier transform output is a Dirac comb function, modulated by a discrete sequence of finite-valued coefficients that are complex-valued in general. These are called Fourier series coefficients. The term Fourier series actually refers to the inverse Fourier transform, which is a sum of sinusoids at discrete frequencies, weighted by the Fourier series coefficients.
*** When the non-zero portion of the input function has finite duration, the Fourier transform is continuous and finite-valued. But a discrete subset of its values is sufficient to reconstruct/represent the portion that was analyzed. The same discrete set is obtained by treating the duration of the segment as one period of a periodic function and computing the Fourier series coefficients.
** Sine and cosine transforms:
*** When the input function has odd or even symmetry around the origin, the Fourier transform reduces to a sine transform or a cosine transform, respectively. Because functions can be uniquely decomposed into an odd function plus an even function, their respective sine and cosine transforms can be added to express the function.
*** The Fourier transform can be expressed as the cosine transform minus formula_1 times the sine transform.
* Hartley transform
* Short-time Fourier transform (or short-term Fourier transform) (STFT)
** Rectangular mask short-time Fourier transform
* Chirplet transform

==Discrete transforms==
For usage on computers, number theory and algebra, discrete arguments (e.g. functions of a series of discrete samples) are often more appropriate, and are handled by the transforms (analogous to the continuous cases above):

* Discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT): Equivalent to the Fourier transform of a &quot;continuous&quot; function that is constructed from the discrete input function by using the sample values to modulate a Dirac comb. When the sample values are derived by sampling a function on the real line, ƒ(&quot;x&quot;), the DTFT is equivalent to a periodic summation of the Fourier transform of ƒ. The DTFT output is always periodic (cyclic). An alternative viewpoint is that the DTFT is a transform to a frequency domain that is bounded (or &quot;finite&quot;), the length of one cycle.
** discrete Fourier transform (DFT):
*** When the input sequence is periodic, the DTFT output is also a Dirac comb function, modulated by the coefficients of a Fourier series which can be computed as a DFT of one cycle of the input sequence. The number of discrete values in one cycle of the DFT is the same as in one cycle of the input sequence.
*** When the non-zero portion of the input sequence has finite duration, the DTFT is continuous and finite-valued. But a discrete subset of its values is sufficient to reconstruct/represent the portion that was analyzed. The same discrete set is obtained by treating the duration of the segment as one cycle of a periodic function and computing the DFT.
** Discrete sine and cosine transforms: When the input sequence has odd or even symmetry around the origin, the DTFT reduces to a discrete sine transform (DST) or discrete cosine transform (DCT).
*** Regressive discrete Fourier series, in which the period is determined by the data rather than fixed in advance.
** Discrete Chebyshev transforms (on the &#x27;roots&#x27; grid and the &#x27;extrema&#x27; grid of the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind). This transform is of much importance in the field of spectral methods for solving differential equations because it can be used to swiftly and efficiently go from grid point values to Chebyshev series coefficients.
* Generalized DFT (GDFT), a generalization of the DFT and constant modulus transforms where phase functions might be of linear with integer and real valued slopes, or even non-linear phase bringing flexibilities for optimal designs of various metrics, e.g. auto- and cross-correlations.
* Discrete-space Fourier transform (DSFT) is the generalization of the DTFT from 1D signals to 2D signals. It is called &quot;discrete-space&quot; rather than &quot;discrete-time&quot; because the most prevalent application is to imaging and image processing where the input function arguments are equally spaced samples of spatial coordinates formula_2. The DSFT output is periodic in both variables.
* Z-transform, a generalization of the DTFT to the entire complex plane
* Modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT)
* Discrete Hartley transform (DHT)
* Also the discretized STFT (see above).
* Hadamard transform (Walsh function).
* Fourier transform on finite groups.
* Discrete Fourier transform (general).

The use of all of these transforms is greatly facilitated by the existence of efficient algorithms based on a fast Fourier transform (FFT). The Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem is critical for understanding the output of such discrete transforms.

<doc id="50908" wikidata="Q212173" url="?curid=50908" title="Roger Ebert">
<text>Roger Joseph Ebert ( ; June 18, 1942 – April 4, 2013) was an American film critic, film historian, journalist, essayist, screenwriter and author. He was the film critic for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; from 1967 until his death in 2013. Ebert was known for his intimate, Midwestern writing style and critical views informed by values of populism and humanism. Writing in a prose style intended to be entertaining and direct, he made sophisticated cinematic and analytical ideas more accessible to non-specialist audiences. Ebert endorsed foreign and independent films he believed would be appreciated by mainstream viewers, championing filmmakers like Werner Herzog, Errol Morris and Spike Lee, as well as Martin Scorsese, whose first published review he wrote. In 1975, Ebert became the first film critic to win the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism. Neil Steinberg of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; said Ebert &quot;was without question the nation&#x27;s most prominent and influential film critic,&quot; and Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called him &quot;the best-known film critic in America.&quot; Per &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The force and grace of his opinions propelled film criticism into the mainstream of American culture. Not only did he advise moviegoers about what to see, but also how to think about what they saw.&quot;

Early in his career, Ebert co-wrote the Russ Meyer film &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot; (1970). Starting in 1975 and continuing for decades, Ebert and &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic Gene Siskel helped popularize nationally televised film reviewing when they co-hosted the PBS show &quot;Sneak Previews&quot;, followed by several variously named &quot;At the Movies&quot; programs on commercial TV broadcast syndication. The two verbally sparred and traded humorous barbs while discussing films. They created and trademarked the phrase &quot;two thumbs up,&quot; used when both gave the same film a positive review. After Siskel died from a brain tumor in 1999, Ebert continued hosting the show with various co-hosts and then, starting in 2000, with Richard Roeper. In 1996, Ebert began publishing essays on great films of the past; the first hundred were published as &quot;The Great Movies&quot;. He published two more volumes, and a fourth was published posthumously. In 1999, he founded the Overlooked Film Festival in his hometown of Champaign, Illinois.

In 2002, Ebert was diagnosed with cancer of the thyroid and salivary glands. He required treatment that included removing a section of his lower jaw in 2006, leaving him severely disfigured and unable to speak or eat normally. However, his ability to write remained unimpaired and he continued to publish frequently online and in print until his death in 2013. His &quot;RogerEbert.com&quot; website, launched in 2002, remains online as an archive of his published writings. Richard Corliss wrote, &quot;Roger leaves a legacy of indefatigable connoisseurship in movies, literature, politics and, to quote the title of his 2011 autobiography, &quot;Life Itself&quot;.&quot; In 2014, &quot;Life Itself&quot; was adapted as a documentary of the same title, released to positive reviews.

== Early life and education ==
Roger Joseph Ebert was born on June 18, 1942, in Urbana, Illinois, the only child of Annabel (née Stumm), a bookkeeper, and Walter Harry Ebert, an electrician. He was raised Roman Catholic, attending St. Mary&#x27;s elementary school and serving as an altar boy in Urbana.

His paternal grandparents were German immigrants and his maternal ancestry was Irish and Dutch. His first movie memory was of his parents taking him to see the Marx Brothers in &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; (1937). He wrote that &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; was &quot;the first real book I ever read, and still the best.&quot; He began his writing career with his own newspaper, &quot;The Washington Street News&quot;, printed in his basement. He wrote letters of comment to the science-fiction fanzines of the era and founded his own, &quot;Stymie&quot;. At age 15, he was a sportswriter for &quot;The News-Gazette&quot; covering Urbana High School sports. He attended Urbana High School, where in his senior year he was class president and co-editor of his high school newspaper, &quot;The Echo&quot;. In 1958, he won the Illinois High School Association state speech championship in &quot;radio speaking,&quot; an event that simulates radio newscasts.

Ebert began taking classes at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign as an early-entrance student, completing his high school courses while also taking his first university class. After graduating from Urbana High School in 1960, he attended the University of Illinois and received his undergraduate degree in journalism in 1964. While there, Ebert worked as a reporter for &quot;The Daily Illini&quot; and served as its editor during his senior year while continuing to work for the &quot;News-Gazette&quot;.

His college mentor was Daniel Curley, who &quot;introduced me to many of the cornerstones of my life&#x27;s reading: &#x27;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&#x27;, &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;, &quot;The Ambassadors&quot;, &quot;Nostromo&quot;, &quot;The Professor&#x27;s House&quot;, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; ... He approached these works with undisguised admiration. We discussed patterns of symbolism, felicities of language, motivation, revelation of character. This was &quot;appreciation&quot;, not the savagery of deconstruction, which approaches literature as pliers do a rose.&quot; One of his classmates was Larry Woiwode, who went on to be the Poet Laureate of North Dakota. At &quot;The&quot; &quot;Daily Illini&quot; Ebert befriended William Nack, who as a sportswriter would cover Secretariat. As an undergraduate, he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity and president of the United States Student Press Association. One of the first reviews he wrote was of &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;, published in &quot;The Daily Illini&quot; in October 1961.

As a graduate student, he &quot;had the good fortune to enroll in a class on Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedies taught by G. Blakemore Evans ... It was then that Shakespeare took hold of me, and it became clear he was the nearest we have come to a voice for what it means to be human.&quot; Ebert spent a semester as a master&#x27;s student in the department of English there before attending the University of Cape Town on a Rotary fellowship for a year. He returned from Cape Town to his graduate studies at Illinois for two more semesters and then, after being accepted as a PhD student at the University of Chicago, he prepared to move to Chicago. He needed a job to support himself while he worked on his doctorate and so applied to the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;, hoping that, as he had already sold freelance pieces to the &quot;Daily News&quot;, including an article on the death of writer Brendan Behan, he would be hired by editor Herman Kogan.

Instead, Kogan referred Ebert to the city editor at the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Jim Hoge, who hired him as a reporter and feature writer in 1966. He attended doctoral classes at the University of Chicago while working as a general reporter for a year. After movie critic Eleanor Keane left the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; in April 1967, editor Robert Zonka gave the job to Ebert. The paper wanted a young critic to cover movies like &quot;The Graduate&quot; and films by Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut. The load of graduate school and being a film critic proved too much, so Ebert left the University of Chicago to focus his energies on film criticism.

==Career==
===1967–1974: Early writings ===

Ebert&#x27;s first review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; began: &quot;Georges Lautner’s &quot;Galia&quot; opens and closes with arty shots of the ocean, mother of us all, but in between it’s pretty clear that what is washing ashore is the French New Wave.&quot; He recalls that &quot;Within a day after Zonka gave me the job, I read &quot;The Immediate Experience&quot; by Robert Warshow&quot;, from which he gleaned that &quot;the critic has to set aside theory and ideology, theology and politics, and open himself to—well, the immediate experience.&quot; That same year, he met film critic Pauline Kael for the first time at the New York Film Festival. After he sent her some of his columns, she told him they were &quot;the best film criticism being done in American newspapers today.&quot; He recalls her telling him how she worked: &quot;I go into the movie, I watch it, and I ask myself what happened to me.&quot; A formative experience was reviewing Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Persona&quot; (1966). He told his editor he wasn&#x27;t sure how to review it when he didn&#x27;t feel he could explain it. His editor told him he didn&#x27;t have to explain it, just describe it.

He was one of the first critics to champion Arthur Penn&#x27;s &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; (1967), calling it &quot;a milestone in the history of American movies, a work of truth and brilliance. It is also pitilessly cruel, filled with sympathy, nauseating, funny, heartbreaking and astonishingly beautiful. If it does not seem that those words should be strung together, perhaps that is because movies do not very often reflect the full range of human life.&quot; He concluded: &quot;The fact that the story is set 35 years ago doesn&#x27;t mean a thing. It had to be set some time. But it was made now and it&#x27;s about us.&quot; Thirty-one years later, he wrote &quot;When I saw it, I had been a film critic for less than six months, and it was the first masterpiece I had seen on the job. I felt an exhilaration beyond describing. I did not suspect how long it would be between such experiences, but at least I learned that they were possible.&quot; He wrote Martin Scorsese&#x27;s first review, for &quot;Who&#x27;s That Knocking at My Door&quot; (1967, then titled &quot;I Call First&quot;), and predicted the young director could become &quot;an American Fellini.&quot;

Ebert co-wrote the screenplay for Russ Meyer&#x27;s &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot; (1970) and sometimes joked about being responsible for it. It was poorly received on its release yet has become a cult film. Ebert and Meyer also made &quot;Up!&quot; (1976), &quot;Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens&quot; (1979) and other films, and were involved in the ill-fated Sex Pistols film &quot;Who Killed Bambi?&quot; In April 2010, Ebert posted his screenplay of &quot;Who Killed Bambi?&quot;, also known as &quot;Anarchy in the UK&quot;, on his blog.

Beginning in 1968, Ebert worked for the University of Chicago as an adjunct lecturer, teaching a night class on film at the Graham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies.

=== 1975–1999: Stardom with &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot; ===

In 1975, Ebert received the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism. In the aftermath of his win, he was offered jobs at &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, but he declined them both, as he did not wish to leave Chicago. That same year, he and Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; began co-hosting a weekly film-review television show, &quot;Opening Soon at a Theater Near You&quot;, later &quot;Sneak Previews&quot;, which was locally produced by the Chicago public broadcasting station WTTW. The series was later picked up for national syndication on PBS. The duo became well known for their &quot;thumbs up/thumbs down&quot; reviews. They trademarked the phrase &quot;Two Thumbs Up.&quot;

In 1982, they moved from PBS to launch a similar syndicated commercial television show, &quot;At the Movies With Gene Siskel &amp; Roger Ebert&quot;. In 1986, they again moved the show to new ownership, creating &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert &amp; the Movies&quot; through Buena Vista Television, part of the Walt Disney Company. Ebert and Siskel made many appearances on late night talk shows, appearing on &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot; sixteen times and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; fifteen times. They also appeared together on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;, &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;.

Siskel and Ebert were sometimes accused of trivializing film criticism. Richard Corliss, in &quot;Film Comment&quot;, called the show &quot;a sitcom (with its own noodling, toodling theme song) starring two guys who live in a movie theater and argue all the time&quot;. Ebert responded that &quot;I am the first to agree with Corliss that the Siskel and Ebert program is not in-depth film criticism&quot; but that &quot;When we have an opinion about a movie, that opinion may light a bulb above the head of an ambitious youth who then understands that people can make up their own minds about movies.&quot; He also noted that they did &quot;theme shows&quot; condemning colorization and showing the virtues of letterboxing. He argued that &quot;good criticism is commonplace these days. &quot;Film Comment&quot; itself is healthier and more widely distributed than ever before. &quot;Film Quarterly&quot; is, too; it even abandoned eons of tradition to increase its page size. And then look at &quot;Cinéaste&quot; and &quot;American Film&quot; and the specialist film magazines (you may not read &quot;Fangoria&quot;, but if you did, you would be amazed at the erudition its writers bring to the horror and special effects genres.)&quot; Corliss wrote that &quot;I do think the program has other merits, and said so in a sentence of my original article that didn&#x27;t make it into type: &#x27;Sometimes the show does good: in spotlighting foreign and independent films, and in raising issues like censorship and colorization.&#x27; The stars&#x27; recent excoriation of the MPAA&#x27;s X rating was salutary to the max.&quot;

In 1996, W. W. Norton &amp; Company asked Ebert to edit an anthology of film writing. This resulted in &quot;Roger Ebert&#x27;s Book of Film: From Tolstoy to Tarantino, the Finest Writing From a Century of Film&quot;. The selections are eclectic, ranging from Louise Brooks&#x27;s autobiography to David Thomson&#x27;s novel &quot;Suspects&quot;. Ebert &quot;wrote to Nigel Wade, then the editor of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, and proposed a biweekly series of longer articles great movies of the past. He gave his blessing ... Every other week I have revisited a great movie, and the response has been encouraging.&quot; The first film he wrote about for the series was &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942). A hundred of these essays were published as &quot;The Great Movies&quot; (2002); he released two more volumes, and a fourth was published posthumously. In 1999, Ebert founded The Overlooked Film Festival (later Ebertfest), in his hometown, Champaign, Illinois.

In May 1998, Siskel took a leave of absence from the show to undergo brain surgery. He returned to the show, although viewers noticed a change in his physical appearance. Despite appearing sluggish and tired, Siskel continued reviewing films with Ebert and would appear on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. In February 1999, Siskel died of a brain tumor. The producers renamed the show &quot;Roger Ebert &amp; the Movies&quot; and used rotating co-hosts including Martin Scorsese,Janet Maslin and A.O. Scott. Ebert wrote of his late colleague: &quot;For the first five years that we knew one another, Gene Siskel and I hardly spoke. Then it seemed like we never stopped.&quot; He wrote of Siskel&#x27;s work ethic, of how quickly he returned to work after surgery: &quot;Someone else might have taken a leave of absence then and there, but Gene worked as long as he could. Being a film critic was important to him. He liked to refer to his job as &#x27;the national dream beat,&#x27; and say that in reviewing movies he was covering what people hoped for, dreamed about, and feared.&quot; Ebert recalled, &quot;Whenever he interviewed someone for his newspaper or for television, Gene Siskel liked to end with the same question: &#x27;What do you know for sure?&#x27; OK Gene, what do I know for sure about you? You were one of the smartest, funniest, quickest men I&#x27;ve ever known and one of the best reporters...I know for sure that seeing a truly great movie made you so happy that you&#x27;d tell me a week later your spirits were still high.&quot; Ten years after Siskel&#x27;s death, Ebert blogged about his colleague: &quot;We once spoke with Disney and CBS about a sitcom to be titled &quot;Best Enemies&quot;. It would be about two movie critics joined in a love/hate relationship. It never went anywhere, but we both believed it was a good idea. Maybe the problem was that no one else could possibly understand how meaningless was the hate, how deep was the love.&quot;

=== 2000–2006: &quot;Ebert &amp; Roeper&quot; ===
In September 2000, &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; columnist Richard Roeper became the permanent co-host and the show was renamed &quot;At the Movies with Ebert &amp; Roeper&quot; and later &quot;Ebert &amp; Roeper&quot;. In 2000, Ebert interviewed President Bill Clinton about movies at The White House.

In 2002, Ebert was diagnosed with cancer of the salivary glands. In 2006, cancer surgery resulted in his losing his ability to eat and speak. In 2007, prior to his Overlooked Film Festival, he posted a picture of his new condition. Paraphrasing a line from &quot;Raging Bull&quot; (1980), he wrote, &quot;I ain’t a pretty boy no more. (Not that I ever was. The original appeal of &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot; was that we didn’t look like we belonged on TV.)&quot; He added that he would not miss the festival: &quot;At least, not being able to speak, I am spared the need to explain why every film is &#x27;overlooked&#x27;, or why I wrote &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot;.&quot;

===2007–2013: &quot;RogerEbert.com&quot;===
Ebert ended his association with &quot;At The Movies&quot; in July 2008, after Disney indicated it wished to take the program in a new direction. As of 2007, his reviews were syndicated to more than 200 newspapers in the United States and abroad. His &quot;RogerEbert.com&quot; website, launched in 2002 and originally underwritten by the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, remains online as an archive of his published writings and reviews while also hosting new material written by a group of critics who were selected by Ebert before his death. Even as he used TV (and later the Internet) to share his reviews, Ebert continued to write for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; until he died. On February 18, 2009, Ebert reported that he and Roeper would soon announce a new movie-review program, and reiterated this plan after Disney announced that the program&#x27;s last episode would air in August 2010. In 2008, having lost his voice, he turned to blogging to express himself. Peter Debruge writes that &quot;Ebert was one of the first writers to recognize the potential of discussing film online.&quot;

His final television series, &quot;Ebert Presents: At the Movies&quot;, premiered on January 21, 2011, with Ebert contributing a review voiced by Bill Kurtis in a brief segment called &quot;Roger&#x27;s Office,&quot; as well as traditional film reviews in the &quot;At the Movies&quot; format by Christy Lemire and Ignatiy Vishnevetsky. The program lasted one season, before being cancelled due to funding constraints.

In 2011, he published his memoir, &quot;Life Itself&quot;, in which he describes his childhood, his career, his struggles with alcoholism and cancer, his loves and friendships. On March 7, 2013, Ebert published his last Great Movies essay, for &quot;The Ballad of Narayama&quot; (1958). The last review Ebert published during his lifetime was for &quot;The Host&quot;, on March 27, 2013. The last review Ebert filed, published posthumously on April 6, 2013, was for &quot;To the Wonder&quot;. In July 2013, a previously unpublished review of &quot;Computer Chess&quot; appeared on &quot;RogerEbert.com&quot;. The review had been written in March but had remained unpublished until the film&#x27;s wide-release date. Matt Zoller Seitz, the editor of &quot;RogerEbert.com&quot;, confirmed that there were other unpublished reviews that would eventually be posted. A second review, for &quot;The Spectacular Now&quot;, was published in August 2013.

In his last blog entry, posted two days before his death, Ebert wrote that his cancer had returned and he was taking &quot;a leave of presence.&quot; &quot;What in the world is a leave of presence? It means I am not going away. My intent is to continue to write selected reviews but to leave the rest to a talented team of writers handpicked and greatly admired by me. What’s more, I’ll be able at last to do what I’ve always fantasized about doing: reviewing only the movies I want to review.&quot; He signed off, &quot;So on this day of reflection I say again, thank you for going on this journey with me. I’ll see you at the movies.&quot;

==Critical style==
Ebert cited Andrew Sarris and Pauline Kael as influences, and often quoted Robert Warshow, who said: &quot;A man goes to the movies. A critic must be honest enough to admit he is that man.&quot; His own credo was: &quot;Your intellect may be confused, but your emotions never lie to you.&quot; He tried to judge a movie on its style rather than its content, and often said &quot;It&#x27;s not what a movie is about, it&#x27;s how it&#x27;s about what it&#x27;s about.&quot;

He awarded four stars to films of the highest quality, and generally a half star to those of the lowest, unless he considered the film to be &quot;artistically inept and morally repugnant&quot;, in which case it received no stars, as with &quot;Death Wish II&quot;. He explained that his star ratings had little meaning outside the context of the review:

Although Ebert rarely wrote outright scathing reviews, he had a reputation for writing memorable ones for the films he really hated, such as &quot;North&quot;. Of that film, he wrote &quot;I hated this movie. Hated hated hated hated hated this movie. Hated it. Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it. Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it. Hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it.&quot; He wrote that &quot;Mad Dog Time&quot; &quot;is the first movie I have seen that does not improve on the sight of a blank screen viewed for the same length of time. Oh, I&#x27;ve seen bad movies before. But they usually made me &quot;care&quot; about how bad they were. Watching &quot;Mad Dog Time&quot; is like waiting for the bus in a city where you&#x27;re not sure they have a bus line&quot; and concluded that the film &quot;should be cut up to provide free ukulele picks for the poor.&quot; Of &quot;Caligula&quot;, he wrote &quot;It is not good art, it is not good cinema, and it is not good porn&quot; and approvingly quoted the woman in front of him at the drinking fountain, who called it &quot;the worst piece of shit I have ever seen.&quot;

Ebert&#x27;s reviews were also characterized by &quot;dry wit.&quot; He often wrote in a deadpan style when discussing a movie&#x27;s flaws; in his review of &quot;&quot;, he wrote that Mrs. Brody&#x27;s &quot;friends pooh-pooh the notion that a shark could identify, follow or even care about one individual human being, but I am willing to grant the point, for the benefit of the plot. I believe that the shark wants revenge against Mrs. Brody. I do. I really do believe it. After all, her husband was one of the men who hunted this shark and killed it, blowing it to bits. And what shark wouldn&#x27;t want revenge against the survivors of the men who killed it? Here are some things, however, that I do not believe&quot;, going on to list the other ways the film strained credulity. He wrote &quot;&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is a two-hour movie squeezed into three hours, about how on Dec. 7, 1941, the Japanese staged a surprise attack on an American love triangle. Its centerpiece is 40 minutes of redundant special effects, surrounded by a love story of stunning banality. The film has been directed without grace, vision, or originality, and although you may walk out quoting lines of dialog, it will not be because you admire them.&quot;
Ebert often included personal anecdotes in his reviews; reviewing &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;, he recalls his early days as a moviegoer: &quot;For five or six years of my life (the years between when I was old enough to go alone, and when TV came to town) Saturday afternoon at the Princess was a descent into a dark magical cave that smelled of Jujubes, melted Dreamsicles and Crisco in the popcorn machine. It was probably on one of those Saturday afternoons that I formed my first critical opinion, deciding vaguely that there was something about John Wayne that set him apart from ordinary cowboys.&quot; Reviewing &quot;Star Wars&quot;, he wrote: &quot;Every once in a while I have what I think of as an out-of-the-body experience at a movie. When the ESP people use a phrase like that, they’re referring to the sensation of the mind actually leaving the body and spiriting itself off to China or Peoria or a galaxy far, far away. When I use the phrase, I simply mean that my imagination has forgotten it is actually present in a movie theater and thinks it’s up there on the screen. In a curious sense, the events in the movie seem real, and I seem to be a part of them...My list of other out-of-the-body films is a short and odd one, ranging from the artistry of &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; or &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; to the slick commercialism of &quot;Jaws&quot; and the brutal strength of &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;. On whatever level (sometimes I’m not at all sure) they engage me so immediately and powerfully that I lose my detachment, my analytical reserve. The movie’s &quot;happening&quot;, and it’s happening to me.&quot; He sometimes wrote reviews in the forms of stories, poems, songs, scripts, open letters, or imagined conversations.

Alex Ross, music critic for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, wrote of how Ebert had influenced his writing: &quot;I noticed how much Ebert could put across in a limited space. He didn&#x27;t waste time clearing his throat. &#x27;They meet for the first time when she is in her front yard practicing baton-twirling,&#x27; begins his review of &quot;Badlands&quot;. Often, he managed to smuggle the basics of the plot into a larger thesis about the movie, so that you don&#x27;t notice the exposition taking place: &#x27;&quot;Broadcast News&quot; is as knowledgeable about the TV news-gathering process as any movie ever made, but it also has insights into the more personal matter of how people use high-pressure jobs as a way of avoiding time alone with themselves.&#x27; The reviews start off in all different ways, sometimes with personal confessions, sometimes with sweeping statements. One way or another, he pulls you in. When he feels strongly, he can bang his fist in an impressive way. His review of &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; ends thus: &#x27;The whole huge grand mystery of the world, so terrible, so beautiful, seems to hang in the balance.&#x27;&quot;

In his introduction to &quot;The Great Movies III&quot;, he wrote:

In the first &quot;Great Movies&quot;, he wrote:


==Preferences==
===Favorites===
In an essay looking back at his first 25 years as a film critic, Ebert wrote:

Ebert credits film historian Donald Richie and the Hawaii International Film Festival for introducing him to Asian cinema through Richie&#x27;s invitation to join him on the jury of the festival in 1983, which quickly became a favorite of his and would frequently attend along with Richie, lending their support to validate the festival&#x27;s status as a &quot;festival of record&quot;. He lamented the decline of campus film societies: &quot;There was once a time when young people made it their business to catch up on the best works by the best directors, but the death of film societies and repertory theaters put an end to that, and for today&#x27;s younger filmgoers, these are not well-known names: Buñuel, Fellini, Bergman, Ford, Kurosawa, Ray, Renoir, Lean, Bresson, Wilder, Welles. Most people still know who Hitchcock was, I guess.&quot;

Ebert argued for the aesthetic values of black-and-white photography and against colorization, writing:

He wrote: &quot;Black-and-white (or, more accurately, silver-and-white) creates a mysterious dream state, a simpler world of form and gesture. Most people do not agree with me. They like color and think a black-and-white film is missing something. Try this. If you have wedding photographs of your parents and grandparents, chances are your parents are in color and your grandparents are in black and white. Put the two photographs side by side and consider them honestly. Your grandparents look timeless. Your parents look goofy.

The next time you buy film for your camera, buy a roll of black-and-white. Go outside at dusk, when the daylight is diffused. Stand on the side of the house away from the sunset. Shoot some natural-light closeups of a friend. Have the pictures printed big, at least 5 x 7. Ask yourself if this friend, who has always looked ordinary in every color photograph you’ve ever taken, does not suddenly, in black and white, somehow take on an aura of mystery. The same thing happens in the movies.&quot;

Ebert championed animation, particularly the films of Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata. In his review of Miyazaki&#x27;s &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;, he wrote: &quot;I go to the movies for many reasons. Here is one of them. I want to see wondrous sights not available in the real world, in stories where myth and dreams are set free to play. Animation opens that possibility, because it is freed from gravity and the chains of the possible. Realistic films show the physical world; animation shows its essence. Animated films are not copies of &#x27;real movies,&#x27; are not shadows of reality, but create a new existence in their own right.&quot; He concluded his review of &quot;Ratatouille&quot; by writing: &quot;Every time an animated film is successful, you have to read all over again about how animation isn&#x27;t &#x27;just for children&#x27; but &#x27;for the whole family,&#x27; and &#x27;even for adults going on their own.&#x27; No kidding!&quot;

Ebert championed documentaries, notably Errol Morris&#x27;s &quot;Gates of Heaven&quot;: &quot;They say you can make a great documentary about anything, as long as you see it well enough and truly, and this film proves it. &quot;Gates of Heaven&quot;, which has no connection to the unfortunate &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;, is about a couple of pet cemeteries and their owners. It was filmed in Southern California, so of course we expect a sardonic look at the peculiarities of the Moonbeam State. But then &quot;Gates of Heaven&quot; grows ever so much more complex and frightening, until at the end it is about such large issues as love, immortality, failure, and the dogged elusiveness of the American Dream.&quot; Morris credited Ebert&#x27;s review with putting him on the map. He championed Michael Apted&#x27;s &quot;Up&quot; films, calling them &quot;an inspired, even noble use of the medium.&quot; Ebert concluded his review of &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; by writing: &quot;Many filmgoers are reluctant to see documentaries, for reasons I&#x27;ve never understood; the good ones are frequently more absorbing and entertaining than fiction. &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot;, however, is not only documentary. It is also poetry and prose, muckraking and expose, journalism and polemic. It is one of the great moviegoing experiences of my lifetime.&quot;

Ebert said that his favorite film was &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, joking, &quot;That&#x27;s the official answer,&quot; although he preferred to emphasize it as &quot;the most important&quot; film. He said seeing &quot;The Third Man&quot; cemented his love of cinema: &quot;This movie is on the altar of my love for the cinema. I saw it for the first time in a little fleabox of a theater on the Left Bank in Paris, in 1962, during my first $5 a day trip to Europe. It was so sad, so beautiful, so romantic, that it became at once a part of my own memories — as if it had happened to me.&quot; He implied that his real favorite film was &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;.

His favorite actor was Robert Mitchum and his favorite actress was Ingrid Bergman. He named Buster Keaton, Yasujirō Ozu, Robert Altman, Werner Herzog and Martin Scorsese as his favorite directors. He expressed his distaste for &quot;top-10&quot; lists, and all movie lists in general, but did make an annual list of the year&#x27;s best films, joking that film critics are &quot;required by unwritten law&quot; to do so. He also contributed an all-time top-10 list for the decennial &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; Critics&#x27; poll in 1982, 1992, 2002 and 2012. In 1982, he chose, alphabetically, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&quot;, &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, &quot;Casablanca&quot;, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;, &quot;Notorious&quot;, &quot;Persona&quot;, &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; and &quot;The Third Man&quot;. In 2012, he chose &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;, &quot;The General&quot;, &quot;Raging Bull&quot;, &quot;Tokyo Story&quot;, &quot;The Tree of Life&quot; and &quot;Vertigo&quot;. Several of the contributors to Ebert&#x27;s website participated in a video tribute to him, featuring films that made his &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; list in 1982 and 2012.

* 2012: &quot;Argo&quot;
Ebert revisited and sometimes revised his opinions. After ranking &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; third on his 1982 list, it was the only movie from that year to appear on his later &quot;Best Films of the 1980s&quot; list (where it also ranked third). He made similar reevaluations of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981) and &quot;Ran&quot; (1985). The &quot;Three Colours trilogy&quot; (&quot;Blue&quot; (1993), &quot;White&quot; (1994), and &quot;Red&quot; (also 1994), and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994) originally ranked second and third on Ebert&#x27;s 1994 list; both were included on his &quot;Best Films of the 1990s&quot; list, but their order had reversed.

In 2006, Ebert noted his own &quot;tendency to place what I now consider the year&#x27;s best film in second place, perhaps because I was trying to make some kind of point with my top pick,&quot; adding, &quot;In 1968, I should have ranked &quot;2001&quot; above &quot;The Battle of Algiers&quot;. In 1971, &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot; was better than &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;. In 1974, &quot;Chinatown&quot; was probably better, in a different way, than &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot;. In 1976, how could I rank &quot;Small Change&quot; above &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;? In 1978, I would put &quot;Days of Heaven&quot; above &quot;An Unmarried Woman&quot;. And in 1980, of course, &quot;Raging Bull&quot; was a better film than &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; ... although I later chose &quot;Raging Bull&quot; as the best film of the entire decade of the 1980s, it was only the second-best film of 1980 ... am I the same person I was in 1968, 1971, or 1980? I hope not.&quot;

Ebert&#x27;s ten best lists resumed in 2014, the first full year after his death, as a Borda count system by his writers.
* 2014: &quot;Under the Skin&quot;
* 2015: &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot;
* 2016: &quot;Moonlight&quot;
* 2017: &quot;Lady Bird&quot;
* 2018: &quot;Roma&quot;
* 2019: &quot;The Irishman&quot;
* 2020: &quot;Lovers Rock&quot;
* 2021: &quot;The Power of the Dog&quot;
* 2022: &quot;The Banshees of Inisherin&quot;
* 2023: &quot;Killers of the Flower Moon&quot;
* 2024: &quot;The Brutalist&quot;
===Best films of the decade===
Ebert compiled &quot;best of the decade&quot; movie lists in the 2000s for the 1970s to the 2000s, thereby helping provide an overview of his critical preferences. Only three films for this listing were named by Ebert as the best film of the year, &quot;Five Easy Pieces&quot; (1970), &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; (1994), and &quot;Synecdoche, New York&quot; (2008). In 2019, the editors of RogerEbert.com continued the tradition as a joint review of the RogerEbert.com writers.

* &quot;Five Easy Pieces&quot; (1970s)
* &quot;Raging Bull&quot; (1980s)
* &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; (1990s)
* &quot;Synecdoche, New York&quot; (2000s)
* &quot;The Tree of Life&quot; (2010s) 

===Genres and content===
Ebert was often critical of the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system (MPAA). His main arguments were that they were too strict on sex and profanity, too lenient on violence, secretive with their guidelines, inconsistent in applying them and not willing to consider the wider context and meaning of the film. He advocated replacing the NC-17 rating with separate ratings for pornographic and nonpornographic adult films. He praised &quot;This Film is Not Yet Rated&quot;, a documentary critiquing the MPAA, adding that their rules are &quot;Kafkaesque.&quot; He signed off on his review of &quot;Almost Famous&quot; by asking, &quot;Why did they give an R rating to a movie so perfect for teenagers?&quot;

Ebert also frequently lamented that cinemas outside major cities are &quot;booked by computer from Hollywood with no regard for local tastes,&quot; making high-quality independent and foreign films virtually unavailable to most American moviegoers.

He wrote that &quot;I&#x27;ve always preferred generic approach to film criticism; I ask myself how good a movie is of its type.&quot; 
He gave &quot;Halloween&quot; four stars: &quot;Seeing it, I was reminded of the favorable review I gave a few years ago to &quot;Last House on the Left&quot;, another really terrifying thriller. Readers wrote to ask how I could possibly support such a movie. But I wasn&#x27;t supporting it so much as describing it: You don&#x27;t want to be scared? Don&#x27;t see it. Credit must be paid to directors who want to really frighten us, to make a good thriller when quite possibly a bad one would have made as much money. Hitchcock is acknowledged as a master of suspense; it&#x27;s hypocrisy to disapprove of other directors in the same genre who want to scare us too.&quot;

Ebert did not believe in grading children&#x27;s movies on a curve, as he thought children were smarter than given credit for and deserved quality entertainment. He began his review of &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;: &quot;Kids are not stupid. They are among the sharpest, cleverest, most eagle-eyed creatures on God&#x27;s green Earth, and very little escapes their notice. You may not have observed that your neighbor is still using his snow-tires in mid-July, but every four-year-old on the block has, and kids pay the same attention when they go to the movies. They don&#x27;t miss a thing, and have an instinctive contempt for shoddy and shabby work. I make this observation because nine out of ten kids&#x27; movies are stupid, witless and display contempt for their audiences. Is that all parents want from kids&#x27; movies? That they not have anything bad in them? Shouldn&#x27;t they have something good in them — some life, imagination, fantasy, inventiveness, something to tickle the imagination? If a movie isn&#x27;t going to do your kids any good, why let them watch it? Just to kill a Saturday afternoon? That shows a subtle contempt for a child&#x27;s mind, I think.&quot; He went on to say he thought &quot;Willy Wonka&quot; was the best movie of its kind since &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

Ebert tried not to judge a film on its ideology. Reviewing &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, he writes: &quot;I am not particularly interested in the &#x27;ideas&#x27; in Coppola&#x27;s film...Like all great works of art about war, &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; essentially contains only one idea or message, the not-especially-enlightening observation that war is hell. We do not go to see Coppola&#x27;s movie for that insight — something Coppola, but not some of his critics, knows well. Coppola also well knows (and demonstrated in &quot;The Godfather&quot; films) that movies aren&#x27;t especially good at dealing with abstract ideas — for those you&#x27;d be better off turning to the written word — but they are superb for presenting moods and feelings, the look of a battle, the expression on a face, the mood of a country. &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; achieves greatness not by analyzing our &#x27;experience in Vietnam,&#x27; but by re-creating, in characters and images, something of that experience.&quot; Ebert commented on films using his Catholic upbringing as a point of reference, and was critical of films he believed were grossly ignorant of or insulting to Catholicism, such as &quot;Stigmata&quot; (1999) and &quot;Priest&quot; (1994). He also gave favorable reviews of controversial films relating to Jesus Christ or Catholicism, including &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; (1988), &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; (2004), and Kevin Smith&#x27;s religious satire &quot;Dogma&quot; (1999). He defended Spike Lee&#x27;s &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;: &quot;Some of the advance articles about this movie have suggested that it is an incitement to racial violence. Those articles say more about their authors than about the movie. I believe that any good-hearted person, white or black, will come out of this movie with sympathy for all of the characters. Lee does not ask us to forgive them, or even to understand everything they do, but he wants us to identify with their fears and frustrations. &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; doesn&#x27;t ask its audiences to choose sides; it is scrupulously fair to both sides, in a story where it is our society itself that is not fair.&quot;

===Contrarian reviews===
Metacritic later noted that Ebert tended to give more lenient ratings than most critics. His average film rating was 71%, if translated into a percentage, compared to 59% for the site as a whole. Of his reviews, 75% were positive and 75% of his ratings were better than his colleagues. Ebert had acknowledged in 2008 that he gave higher ratings on average than other critics, though he said this was in part because he considered a rating of 3 out of 4 stars to be the general threshold for a film to get a &quot;thumbs up.&quot;

Writing in &quot;Hazlitt&quot; about Ebert&#x27;s reviews, Will Sloan argued that &quot;[t]here were inevitably movies where he veered from consensus, but he was not provocative or idiosyncratic by nature.&quot; Examples of Ebert dissenting from other critics include his negative reviews of such celebrated films as &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; (&quot;marred by sophomoric satire and cheap shots&quot;), &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (&quot;a paranoid right-wing fantasy masquerading as an Orwellian warning&quot;), and &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; (&quot;To the degree that I do understand, I don&#x27;t care&quot;). He gave only two out of four stars to the widely acclaimed &quot;Brazil&quot;, calling it &quot;very hard to follow&quot; and is the only critic on RottenTomatoes to not like it.

He gave a one-star review to the critically acclaimed Abbas Kiarostami film &quot;Taste of Cherry&quot;, which won the &quot;Palme d&#x27;Or&quot; at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival. Ebert later added the film to a list of his most-hated movies of all time. He was dismissive of the 1988 Bruce Willis action film &quot;Die Hard&quot;, stating that &quot;inappropriate and wrongheaded interruptions reveal the fragile nature of the plot&quot;. His positive 3 out of 4 stars review of 1997&#x27;s &quot;Speed 2: Cruise Control&quot;, &quot;Movies like this embrace goofiness with an almost sensual pleasure&quot; is one of only three positive reviews accounting for that film&#x27;s 4% approval rating on the reviewer aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, one of the two others having been written by his &quot;At the Movies&quot; co-star Gene Siskel.

Ebert reflected on his &quot;Speed 2&quot; review in 2013, and wrote that it was &quot;Frequently cited as an example of what a lousy critic I am,&quot; but defended his opinion, and noted, &quot;I&#x27;m grateful to movies that show me what I haven&#x27;t seen before, and &quot;Speed 2&quot; had a cruise ship plowing right up the main street of a Caribbean village.&quot; In 1999, Ebert held a contest for University of Colorado Boulder students to create short films with a &quot;Speed 3&quot; theme about an object that could not stop moving. The winning entrant was set on a roller coaster and was screened at Ebertfest that year.

===Other interests===
In addition to film, Ebert occasionally wrote about other topics for the &quot;Sun-Times&quot;, such as music. In 1970, Ebert wrote the first published concert review of singer-songwriter John Prine, who at the time was working as a mailman and performing at Chicago folk clubs.

Ebert was a lifelong reader, and said he had &quot;more or less every book I have owned since I was seven, starting with &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;.&quot; Among the authors he considered indispensable were Shakespeare, Henry James, Willa Cather, Colette and Simenon. He writes of his friend William Nack: &quot;He approached literature like a gourmet. He relished it, savored it, inhaled it, and after memorizing it rolled it on his tongue and spoke it aloud. It was Nack who already knew in the early 1960s, when he was a very young man, that Nabokov was perhaps the supreme stylist of modern novelists. He recited to me from &quot;Lolita,&quot; and from &quot;Speak, Memory&quot; and &quot;Pnin&quot;. I was spellbound.&quot; Every time Ebert saw Nack, he&#x27;d ask him to recite the last lines of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. Reviewing &quot;Stone Reader&quot;, he wrote: &quot;get me in conversation with another reader, and I&#x27;ll recite titles, too. Have you ever read &quot;The Quincunx&quot;? &quot;The Raj Quartet&quot;? &quot;A Fine Balance&quot;? Ever heard of that most despairing of all travel books, &quot;The Saddest Pleasure&quot;, by Moritz Thomsen? Does anybody hold up better than Joseph Conrad and Willa Cather? Know any Yeats by heart? Surely P. G. Wodehouse is as great at what he does as Shakespeare was at what he did.&quot; Among contemporary authors he admired Cormac McCarthy, and credited &quot;Suttree&quot; with reviving his love of reading after his illness. He also loved audiobooks, particularly praising Sean Barrett&#x27;s reading of &quot;Perfume&quot;. He was a fan of Hergé&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, which he read in French.

Ebert first visited London in 1966 with his professor Daniel Curley, who &quot;started me on a lifelong practice of wandering around London. From 1966 to 2006, I visited London never less than once a year and usually more than that. Walking the city became a part of my education, and in this way I learned a little about architecture, British watercolors, music, theater and above all people. I felt a freedom in London I&#x27;ve never felt elsewhere. I made lasting friends. The city lends itself to walking, can be intensely exciting at eye level, and is being eaten alive block by block by brutal corporate leg-lifting.&quot; Ebert and Curley coauthored &quot;The Perfect London Walk&quot;.

Ebert attended the Conference on World Affairs at the University of Colorado Boulder for many years. It was there that he coined the Boulder Pledge: &quot;Under no circumstances will I ever purchase anything offered to me as the result of an unsolicited e-mail message. Nor will I forward chain letters, petitions, mass mailings, or virus warnings to large numbers of others. This is my contribution to the survival of the online community.&quot; Starting in 1975, he hosted a program called Cinema Interruptus, where would analyze a film with an audience, and anyone could say &quot;Stop!&quot; to point out anything they found interesting. He wrote &quot;Boulder is my hometown in an alternate universe. I have walked its streets by day and night, in rain, snow, and sunshine. I have made life-long friends there. I was in my twenties when I first came to the Conference on World Affairs and was greeted by Howard Higman, its choleric founder, with &#x27;Who invited you back?&#x27; Since then I have appeared on countless panels where I have learned and rehearsed debatemanship, the art of talking to anybody about anything.&quot; In 2009, Ebert invited Ramin Bahrani to join him in analyzing Bahrani&#x27;s film &quot;Chop Shop&quot; a frame at a time. The next year, they invited Werner Herzog to join them in analyzing &quot;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&quot;. After that, Ebert announced that he would not return to the conference: &quot;It is fueled by speech, and I&#x27;m out of gas ... But I went there for my adult lifetime and had a hell of a good time.&quot;

===Relations with filmmakers===
Ebert wrote Martin Scorsese&#x27;s first review, for &quot;Who&#x27;s That Knocking at My Door&quot;, and predicted the director could be &quot;an American Fellini someday.&quot; He later wrote, &quot;Of the directors who started making films since I came on the job, the best is Martin Scorsese. His camera is active, not passive. It doesn’t regard events, it participates in them. There is a sequence in &quot;GoodFellas&quot; that follows Henry Hill’s last day of freedom, before the cops swoop down. Scorsese uses an accelerating pacing and a paranoid camera that keeps looking around, and makes us feel what Hill feels. It is easy enough to make an audience feel basic emotions (&#x27;Play them like a piano,&#x27; Hitchcock advised), but hard to make them share a state of mind. Scorsese can do it.&quot; In 2000, Scorsese joined Ebert on his show in choosing the best films of the 1990s.

Ebert was an admirer of Werner Herzog, and conducted a Q&amp;A session with him at the Walker Arts Center in 1999. It was there that Herzog read his &quot;Minnesota Declaration&quot; which defined his idea of &quot;ecstatic truth.&quot; Herzog dedicated his &quot;Encounters at the End of the World&quot; to Ebert, and Ebert responded with an open letter of gratitude. Ebert often quoted something Herzog told him: &quot;our civilization is starving for new images.&quot;

When Vincent Gallo&#x27;s &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot; (2003) premiered at Cannes, Ebert called it the worst film in the history of the festival. Gallo responded by putting a curse on his colon and a hex on his prostate. Ebert replied, &quot;I had a colonoscopy once, and they let me watch it on TV. It was more entertaining than &quot;The Brown Bunny.&quot;&quot; Gallo called Ebert a &quot;fat pig&quot;. Ebert replied: &quot;It is true that I am fat, but one day I will be thin, and he will still be the director of &quot;The Brown Bunny.&quot;&quot; Ebert gave the director&#x27;s cut a positive review, writing that Gallo &quot;is not the director of the same &quot;Brown Bunny&quot; I saw at Cannes, and the film now plays so differently that I suggest the original Cannes cut be included as part of the eventual DVD, so that viewers can see for themselves how 26 minutes of aggressively pointless and empty footage can sink a potentially successful film...Make no mistake: The Cannes version was a bad film, but now Gallo&#x27;s editing has set free the good film inside.&quot; 

In 2005, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Patrick Goldstein wrote that the year’s Best Picture Nominees were &quot;ignored, unloved and turned down flat by most of the same studios that … bankroll hundreds of sequels, including a follow-up to &quot;Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo,&quot; a film that was sadly overlooked at Oscar time because apparently nobody had the foresight to invent a category for Best Running Penis Joke Delivered by a Third-Rate Comic.&quot; Rob Schneider responded in an open letter: &quot;Well, Mr. Goldstein, I decided to do some research to find out what awards you have won. I went online and found that you have won nothing. Absolutely nothing. No journalistic awards of any kind … Maybe you didn’t win a Pulitzer Prize because they haven’t invented a category for Best Third-Rate, Unfunny Pompous Reporter Who’s Never Been Acknowledged by His Peers.&quot; Reviewing &quot;Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo&quot;, Ebert responded: &quot;Reading this, I was about to observe that Schneider can dish it out but he can’t take it. Then I found he’s not so good at dishing it out, either. I went online and found that Patrick Goldstein has won a National Headliner Award, a Los Angeles Press Club Award, a RockCritics.com award, and the Publicists’ Guild award for lifetime achievement ... Schneider is correct, and Patrick Goldstein has not yet won a Pulitzer Prize. Therefore, Goldstein is not qualified to complain that Columbia financed &quot;Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo&quot; while passing on the opportunity to participate in &quot;Million Dollar Baby,&quot; &quot;Ray&quot;, &quot;The Aviator,&quot; &quot;Sideways&quot; and &quot;Finding Neverland.&quot; As chance would have it, I &quot;have&quot; won the Pulitzer Prize, and so I am qualified. Speaking in my official capacity as a Pulitzer Prize winner, Mr. Schneider, your movie sucks.&quot; After Ebert&#x27;s cancer surgery, he received a bouquet from &quot;Your Least Favorite Movie Star, Rob Schneider&quot;. Ebert wrote of the flowers, &quot;They were a reminder, if I needed one, that although Rob Schneider might (in my opinion) have made a bad movie, he is not a bad man, and no doubt tried to make a wonderful movie, and hopes to again. I hope so, too.&quot;

===Views on technology===
Ebert was a strong advocate for Maxivision 48, in which the movie projector runs at 48 frames per second, as compared to the usual 24 frames per second. He was opposed to the practice whereby theaters lower the intensity of their projector bulbs in order to extend the life of the bulb, arguing that this has little effect other than to make the film harder to see. Ebert was skeptical of the resurgence of 3D effects in film, which he found unrealistic and distracting.

===Views on video games as an art form===

In 2005, Ebert opined that video games are not art, and are inferior to media created through authorial control, such as film and literature, stating, &quot;video games can be elegant, subtle, sophisticated, challenging and visually wonderful,&quot; but &quot;the nature of the medium prevents it from moving beyond craftsmanship to the stature of art.&quot; This resulted in negative reaction from video game enthusiasts, such as writer Clive Barker, who defended video games as an art form. Responding to Barker, Ebert wrote, &quot;I believe art is created by an artist. If you change it, you become the artist,&quot; and said that the main attributes of video games &quot;have more in common with sports&quot; than they do with arts. Ebert maintained his position in 2010, but conceded that he should not have expressed this skepticism without being more familiar with the actual experience of playing them. He admitted that he barely played video games: &quot;I have played &quot;Cosmology of Kyoto&quot; which I enormously enjoyed, and &quot;Myst&quot; for which I lacked the patience.&quot; In the article, Ebert wrote, &quot;It is quite possible a game could someday be great art.&quot;

Ebert had reviewed &quot;Cosmology of Kyoto&quot; for &quot;Wired&quot; in 1994, and had praised the exploration, depth, and graphics found in the game, writing &quot;This is the most beguiling computer game I have encountered, a seamless blend of information, adventure, humor, and imagination — the gruesome side-by-side with the divine.&quot; Ebert filed one other video game-related article for &quot;Wired&quot; in 1994, in which he described his visit to Sega&#x27;s Joypolis arcade in Tokyo.
=== Appearances in other media ===
Ebert provided DVD audio commentaries for &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941), &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942), &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot; (1970) and &quot;Dark City&quot; (1998). For the Criterion Collection, he recorded commentaries for &quot;Floating Weeds&quot; (1959) and &quot;Crumb&quot; (1994), the latter with director Terry Zwigoff. Ebert was also interviewed by Central Park Media for an extra feature on the DVD release of &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; (1988).

In 1982, 1983 and 1985, Gene Siskel and Ebert appeared as themselves on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. For their first two appearances, they reviewed sketches from that night&#x27;s telecast; for their last, they reviewed sketches from the &quot;SNL Film Festival&quot;. In 1991, Siskel and Ebert appeared in the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; segment &quot;Sneak Peek Previews&quot; (a parody of &quot;Sneak Previews&quot;). That year, the two were in the show&#x27;s celebrity version of &quot;Monster in the Mirror&quot;. In 1995, Siskel and Ebert guest-starred on an episode of the animated sitcom &quot;The Critic&quot;. In the episode, a parody of &quot;Sleepless in Seattle,&quot; Siskel and Ebert split and each wants protagonist Jay Sherman, a fellow film critic, as his new partner.

In 1997, Ebert appeared in &quot;Pitch&quot;, a documentary by Spencer Rice and Kenny Hotz and the Chicago-set television series &quot;Early Edition&quot;, where consoles a young boy who is depressed after he sees the character Bosco the Bunny die in a movie. Ebert made a cameo in &quot;Abby Singer&quot; (2003). In 2004, Ebert appeared in &quot;Sesame Street&quot;&#x27;s direct-to-video special &quot;A Celebration of Me, Grover&quot;, delivering a review of the &quot;Monsterpiece Theater&quot; segment &quot;The King and I&quot;. Ebert was one of the principal critics featured in Gerald Peary&#x27;s 2009 documentary &quot;For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism&quot;. He discusses the dynamics of appearing with Gene Siskel on the 1970s show &quot;Coming to a Theatre Near You&quot;, the predecessor of &quot;Sneak Previews&quot; on Chicago PBS station WTTW, and expresses approval of the proliferation of young people writing film reviews today on the internet. On October 22, 2010, Ebert appeared with Robert Osborne on Turner Classic Movies during their &quot;The Essentials&quot; series. Ebert selected &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; (1957) and &quot;The Lady Eve&quot; (1941).

A &quot;Mayor Ebert&quot; (Michael Lerner) appeared in the 1998 remake of &quot;Godzilla&quot;. In his review, Ebert wrote: &quot;Now that I&#x27;ve inspired a character in a Godzilla movie, all I really still desire is for several Ingmar Bergman characters to sit in a circle and read my reviews to one another in hushed tones.&quot;

==Personal life==
=== Marriage ===
At age 50, Ebert married trial attorney Charlie &quot;Chaz&quot; Hammel-Smith in 1992. Chaz Ebert became vice president of the Ebert Company and has emceed Ebertfest. He explained in his memoir, &quot;Life Itself&quot;, that he did not want to marry before his mother died, as he was afraid of displeasing her. In a July 2012 blog entry, Ebert wrote about Chaz, &quot;She fills my horizon, she is the great fact of my life, she has my love, she saved me from the fate of living out my life alone, which is where I seemed to be heading... She has been with me in sickness and in health, certainly far more sickness than we could have anticipated. I will be with her, strengthened by her example. She continues to make my life possible, and her presence fills me with love and a deep security. That&#x27;s what a marriage is for. Now I know.&quot;

=== Alcoholism recovery ===
Ebert was a recovering alcoholic, having quit drinking in 1979. He was a member of Alcoholics Anonymous and had written some blog entries on the subject. Ebert was a longtime friend of Oprah Winfrey, and Winfrey credited him with persuading her to syndicate &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, which became the highest-rated talk show in American television history.

===Health===
In February 2002, Ebert was diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer which was successfully removed. In 2003, he underwent surgery for salivary gland cancer, which was followed up by radiation therapy. He was again diagnosed with cancer in 2006. In June of that year, he had a mandibulectomy to remove cancerous tissue in the right side of his jaw. A week later he had a life-threatening complication when his carotid artery burst near the surgery site. He was confined to bed rest and was unable to speak, eat, or drink for a time, necessitating the use of a feeding tube.

The complications kept Ebert off the air for an extended period. Ebert made his first public appearance since mid-2006 at Ebertfest on April 25, 2007. He was unable to speak, instead communicating through his wife. He returned to reviewing on May 18, 2007, when three of his reviews were published in print. In July 2007, he revealed that he was still unable to speak. Ebert adopted a computerized voice system to communicate, eventually using a copy of his own voice created from his recordings by CereProc.

In March 2010, his health trials and new computerized voice were featured on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;. In 2011, Ebert gave a TED talk assisted by his wife, Chaz, and friends Dean Ornish and John Hunter, called &quot;Remaking my voice&quot; in which, he proposed a test to determine the verisimilitude of a synthesized voice.

Ebert underwent further surgery in January 2008 to try to restore his voice and address the complications from his previous surgeries. On April 1, Ebert announced his speech had not been restored. Ebert underwent further surgery in April 2008 after fracturing his hip in a fall. By 2011, Ebert had a prosthetic chin made to hide some of the damage done by his many surgeries.

In December 2012, Ebert was hospitalized due to the fractured hip, which was subsequently determined to be the result of cancer.

Ebert wrote that &quot;what&#x27;s sad about not eating&quot; was:The loss of dining, not the loss of food. It may be personal, but for me, unless I&#x27;m alone, it doesn&#x27;t involve dinner if it doesn&#x27;t involve talking. The food and drink I can do without easily. The jokes, gossip, laughs, arguments and shared memories I miss. Sentences beginning with the words, &quot;Remember that time?&quot; I ran in crowds where anyone was likely to break out in a poetry recitation at any time. Me too. But not me anymore. So yes, it&#x27;s sad. Maybe that&#x27;s why I enjoy this blog. You don&#x27;t realize it, but we&#x27;re at dinner right now.

=== Politics ===
A supporter of the Democratic Party, he wrote of how his Catholic schooling led him to his politics: &quot;Through a mental process that has by now become almost instinctive, those nuns guided me into supporting universal health care, the rightness of labor unions, fair taxation, prudence in warfare, kindness in peacetime, help for the hungry and homeless, and equal opportunity for the races and genders. It continues to surprise me that many who consider themselves religious seem to tilt away from me.&quot;

Ebert was critical of political correctness, &quot;a rigid feeling that you have to keep your ideas and your ways of looking at things within very narrow boundaries, or you&#x27;ll offend someone. Certainly one of the purposes of journalism is to challenge that kind of thinking. And certainly one of the purposes of criticism is to break boundaries. It&#x27;s also one of the purposes of art.&quot; He lamented that &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; &quot;has regrettably been under fire in recent years from myopic advocates of Political Correctness, who do not have a bone of irony (or humor) in their bodies, and cannot tell the difference between what is said or done in the novel, and what Twain means by it.&quot; Ebert defended the cast and crew of Justin Lin&#x27;s &quot;Better Luck Tomorrow&quot; (2002) during a Sundance Film Festival screening when a white member of the audience asked “Why, with the talent yup there and yourself, make a film so empty and amoral for Asian Americans and for Americans?” Ebert responded that &quot;What I find very offensive and condescending about your statement is nobody would say to a bunch of white filmmakers, ‘How could you do this to &#x27;your people&#x27;?...Asian-American characters have the right to be whoever the hell they want to be. They do not have to represent &#x27;their people&#x27;!&quot; He was a supporter of the film after the incident at Sundance.

Ebert opposed the Iraq War, writing: &quot;Am I against the war? Of course. Do I support our troops? Of course. They were sent to endanger their lives by zealots with occult objectives.&quot; He endorsed Barack Obama for re-election in 2012, citing the Affordable Care Act as one important reason for his support of Obama. He was concerned about income inequality, writing: &quot;I have no objection to financial success. I&#x27;ve had a lot of it myself. All of my income came from paychecks from jobs I held and books I published. I have the quaint idea that wealth should be obtained by legal and conventional means–by working, in other words–and not through the manipulation of financial scams. You&#x27;re familiar with the ways bad mortgages were urged upon people who couldn&#x27;t afford them, by banks who didn&#x27;t care that the loans were bad. The banks made the loans and turned a profit by selling them to investors while at the same time betting against them on their own account. While Wall Street was knowingly trading the worthless paper that led to the financial collapse of 2008, executives were being paid huge bonuses.&quot; He voiced tentative support for the Occupy Wall Street movement: &quot;I believe the Occupiers are opposed to the lawless and destructive greed in the financial industry, and the unhealthy spread in this country between the rich and the rest.&quot; Referring to the subprime mortgage crisis, he wrote: &quot;I have also felt despair at the way financial instruments were created and manipulated to deliberately defraud the ordinary people in this country. At how home buyers were peddled mortgages they couldn&#x27;t afford, and civilian investors were sold worthless &#x27;securities&#x27; based on those bad mortgages. Wall Street felt no shame in backing paper that was intended to fail, and selling it to customers who trusted them. This is clear and documented. It is theft and fraud on a staggering scale.&quot; He was also sympathetic to Ron Paul, noting that he &quot;speaks directly and clearly without a lot of hot air and lip flap&quot;. In a review of the 2008 documentary &quot;I.O.U.S.A.&quot;, he credited Paul with being &quot;a lonely voice talking about the debt&quot;, proposing based on the film that the US government was &quot;already broke&quot;. He opposed the war on drugs and capital punishment.

Laura Emerick, his &quot;Sun Times&quot; editor, recalled: “His union sympathies began at an early age. His father, Walter, worked as an electrician, and Roger remained a member of the Newspaper Guild throughout his career — though after he became an independent contractor, he probably could have opted out. He famously stood with the Guild in 2004, when he wrote to then publisher John Cruickshank that ‘it would be with a heavy heart that I would go on strike against my beloved Sun-Times, but strike I will if a strike is called.&#x27;” He lamented that &quot;Most Americans don’t understand the First Amendment, don’t understand the idea of freedom of speech, and don’t understand that it’s the responsibility of the citizen to speak out.&quot; Regarding his own freedom of speech, he said: &quot;I write op-ed columns for the Chicago Sun-Times, and people send me e-mails saying, &#x27;You&#x27;re a movie critic. You don&#x27;t know anything about politics.&#x27; Well, you know what, I&#x27;m 60 years old, and I&#x27;ve been interested in politics since I was on my daddy&#x27;s knee... I know a lot about politics.&quot;

=== Beliefs ===
Ebert was critical of intelligent design, and stated that people who believe in either creationism or New Age beliefs such as crystal healing or astrology should not be president. He wrote that in Catholic school he learned of the &quot;Theory of Evolution, which in its elegance and blinding obviousness became one of the pillars of my reasoning, explaining so many things in so many ways. It was an introduction not only to logic but to symbolism, thus opening a window into poetry, literature and the arts in general. All my life I have deplored those who interpret something only on its most simplistic level.&quot;

Ebert described himself as an agnostic on at least one occasion, but at other times explicitly rejected that designation; biographer Matt Singer wrote that Ebert opposed any categorization of his beliefs. In 2009, Ebert wrote that he did not &quot;want [his] convictions reduced to a word,&quot; and stated, &quot;I have never said, although readers have freely informed me I am an atheist, an agnostic, or at the very least a secular humanist – which I am.&quot; He wrote of his Catholic upbringing: &quot;I believed in the basic Church teachings because I thought they were correct, not because God wanted me to. In my mind, in the way I interpret them, I still live by them today. Not by the rules and regulations, but by the principles. For example, in the matter of abortion, I am pro-choice, but my personal choice would be to have nothing to do with an abortion, certainly not of a child of my own. I believe in free will, and believe I have no right to tell anyone else what to do. Above all, the state does not.&quot; He wrote &quot;I am not a believer, not an atheist, not an agnostic. I am still awake at night, asking &quot;how&quot;? I am more content with the question than I would be with an answer.&quot; He writes: &quot;I was asked at lunch today who or what I worshiped. The question was asked sincerely, and in the same spirit I responded that I worshiped whatever there might be outside knowledge. I worship the void. The mystery. And the ability of our human minds to perceive an unanswerable mystery. To reduce such a thing to simplistic names is an insult to it, and to our intelligence.&quot;

He wrote: &quot;I drank for many years in a tavern that had a photograph of Brendan Behan on the wall, and under it is this quotation, which I memorized: &quot;&#x27;I respect kindness in human beings first of all, and kindness to animals. I don&#x27;t respect the law; I have a total irreverence for anything concerned with society except that which makes the roads safer, the beer stronger, the food cheaper and the old men and the old women warmer in the winter and happier in the summer.&quot;&#x27; For 57 words, that does a pretty good job of summing it up.&quot; Summarizing his beliefs, Ebert wrote:

I believe that if, at the end of it all, according to our abilities, we have done something to make others a little happier, and something to make ourselves a little happier, that is about the best we can do. To make others less happy is a crime. To make ourselves unhappy is where all crime starts. We must try to contribute joy to the world. That is true no matter what our problems, our health, our circumstances. We must try. I didn&#x27;t always know this, and am happy I lived long enough to find it out.

He wrote: &quot;I correspond with a dear friend, the wise and gentle Australian director Paul Cox. Our subject sometimes turns to death. In 2010 he came very close to dying before receiving a liver transplant. In 1988 he made a documentary named &quot;Vincent: The Life and Death of Vincent Van Gogh&quot;. Paul wrote that in his Arles days, van Gogh called himself &#x27;a simple worshiper of the external Buddha.&#x27; Paul told me that in those days, Vincent wrote: 

 Looking at the stars always makes me dream, as simply as I dream over the black dots representing towns and villages on a map. 

Why, I ask myself, shouldn&#x27;t the shining dots of the sky be as accessible as the black dots on the map of France? 

Just as we take a train to get to Tarascon or Rouen, we take death to reach a star. We cannot get to a star any more when we are alive than we can take the train when we are dead. So to me it seems possible that cholera, tuberculosis and cancer are the celestial means of locomotion. Just as steamboats, buses and railways are the terrestrial means. 

To die simply of old age would be to go there on foot. 

That is a lovely thing to read, and a relief to find I will probably take the celestial locomotive. Or, as the little dog, Milou, says whenever Tintin proposes a journey, &#x27;Not by foot, I hope!&#x27;&quot;

==Death and legacy ==
On April 4, 2013, Ebert died at age 70 at a hospital in Chicago, shortly before he was set to return to his home and enter hospice care.

President Barack Obama wrote, &quot;For a generation of Americans — and especially Chicagoans — Roger was the movies... [he could capture] the unique power of the movies to take us somewhere magical. ... The movies won&#x27;t be the same without Roger.&quot; Martin Scorsese released a statement saying, &quot;The death of Roger Ebert is an incalculable loss for movie culture and for film criticism. And it&#x27;s a loss for me personally... there was a professional distance between us, but then I could talk to him much more freely than I could to other critics. Really, Roger was my friend. It&#x27;s that simple.&quot;

Steven Spielberg stated that Ebert&#x27;s &quot;reviews went far deeper than simply thumbs up or thumbs down. He wrote with passion through a real knowledge of film and film history, and in doing so, helped many movies find their audiences... [He] put television criticism on the map.&quot; Numerous celebrities paid tribute including Christopher Nolan, Oprah Winfrey, Steve Martin, Albert Brooks, Jason Reitman, Ron Howard, Darren Aronofsky, Larry King, Cameron Crowe, Werner Herzog, Howard Stern, Steve Carell, Stephen Fry, Diablo Cody, Anna Kendrick, Jimmy Kimmel, and Patton Oswalt.

Michael Phillips of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; recalled that &quot;I came late to film criticism in Chicago, after writing about the theater. Roger loved the theater. His was a theatrical personality: a raconteur, a spinner of dinner-table stories, a man who was not shy about his accomplishments. But he made room in that theatrical, improbable, outsized life for others.&quot; Andrew O&#x27;Hehir of &quot;Salon&quot; wrote that &quot;He&#x27;s up there with Will Rogers, H. L. Mencken, A. J. Liebling and not too far short of Mark Twain as one of the great plainspoken commentators on American life.&quot;

Peter Debruge wrote &quot;Ebert’s negative reviews were invariably his most entertaining, and yet, he never insulted those who found something to admire in lesser films. Instead, he hoped to enlighten readers, challenging them to think, while whetting their appetite for stronger work ... It’s a testament to Ebert’s gift that, after a life spent writing about film, he made us love the movies all the more. ...I’ve always suspected the reason he settled into this profession is that film reviews, as he wrote them, served as a Trojan horse for the delivery of bigger philosophical ideas, of which he had an inexhaustible supply to share.&quot;

&quot;The Onion&quot; paid tribute to Ebert: &quot;Calling the overall human existence &#x27;poignant,&#x27; &#x27;thought-provoking,&#x27; and &#x27;a complete tour de force,&#x27; film critic Roger Ebert praised existence as &#x27;an audacious and thrilling triumph.&#x27;...&#x27;At times brutally sad, yet surprisingly funny, and always completely honest, I wholeheartedly recommend existence. If you haven&#x27;t experienced it yet, what are you waiting for? It is not to be missed.&#x27; Ebert later said that while human existence&#x27;s running time was &#x27;a little on the long side&#x27; it could have gone on much, much longer and he would have been perfectly happy.&quot;

Hundreds of people attended the funeral Mass held at Chicago&#x27;s Holy Name Cathedral on April 8, 2013, where Ebert was celebrated as a film critic, newspaperman, advocate for social justice, and husband. Father Michael Pfleger concluded the service with &quot;the balconies of heaven are filled with angels singing &#x27;Thumbs Up&#x27; &quot;. Reverend John F. Costello of Loyola University delivered a homily for Ebert. After the funeral service, he was buried at Graceland Cemetery in Chicago, Illinois

A documentary adaptation of &quot;Life Itself&quot; (2014), directed by Steve James, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. The film was executive produced by Martin Scorsese and includes interviews with Scorsese, Ava DuVernay, Werner Herzog, Errol Morris and numerous critics. The film received critical acclaim and received numerous accolades including a Emmy Award, Producers Guild of America Award and Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award.

== Memorials ==

A nearly-three-hour public tribute, entitled &quot;Roger Ebert: A Celebration of Life&quot;, was held on April 11, 2013, at the Chicago Theatre. It featured in-person remembrances, video testimonials, video and film clips, and gospel choirs, and was, according to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; Mark Caro, &quot;a laughter- and sorrow-filled send-off from the entertainment and media worlds.&quot;

In September 2013, organizers in Champaign, Illinois, announced plans to raise $125,000 to build a life-size bronze statue of Roger Ebert in the town, which was unveiled in front of the Virginia Theatre at Ebertfest on April 24, 2014. The composition was selected by his widow, Chaz Ebert, and depicts Ebert sitting in the middle of three theater seats giving a &quot;thumbs up.&quot;

The 2013 Toronto International Film Festival opened with a video tribute of Ebert at Roy Thomson Hall during the world premiere of the WikiLeaks-based film &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot;. Ebert had been an avid supporter of the festival since its inception in the 1970s. Chaz was in attendance to accept a plaque on Roger&#x27;s behalf. At the same festival, Errol Morris dedicated his film &quot;The Unknown Known&quot; to Ebert, saying &quot;He was a really fabulous part of my life, a good friend, a champion, an inspiring writer. I loved Roger.&quot;

In August 2013, the Plaza Classic Film Festival in El Paso, Texas, paid homage to Ebert by screening seven films that played a role in his life: &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, &quot;The Third Man, Tokyo Story, La Dolce Vita&quot;, &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot;, &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot; and &quot;Goodfellas&quot;.

At the 86th Academy Awards ceremony, Ebert was included in the &quot;in memoriam&quot; montage, a rare honor for a film critic.

In 2014, the documentary &quot;Life Itself&quot; was released. Director Steve James, whose films had been widely advocated by Ebert, started making the documentary while Ebert was still alive. Martin Scorsese served as an executive producer. The film studies Ebert&#x27;s life and career, while also filming Ebert during his final months, and includes interviews with his family and friends. It was universally praised by critics. It has a 98% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

Werner Herzog told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that Ebert was &quot;a soldier of the cinema&quot;: &quot;I always loved Roger for being the good soldier, not only the good soldier of cinema, but he was a wounded soldier who for years in his affliction held out and plowed on and soldiered on and held the outpost that was given up by almost everyone: The monumental shift now is that intelligent, deep discourse about cinema has been something that has been vanishing over the last maybe two decades...I&#x27;ve always tried to be a good soldier of cinema myself, so of course since he&#x27;s gone, I will plow on, as I have plowed on all my life, but I will do what I have to do as if Roger was looking over my shoulder. And I am not gonna disappoint him.&quot;

Ebert was inducted as a laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois. In 2001, the governor of Illinois awarded him the state&#x27;s highest honor, the Order of Lincoln, in the area of performing arts. In 2016, Ebert was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame.

The website &quot;RogerEbert.com&quot; contains an archive of every review Ebert wrote, as well as many essays and opinion pieces. The site, operated by Ebert Digital (a partnership between Chaz and friend Josh Golden), continues to publish new material written by a group of critics who were selected by Ebert before his death.

<text>In mathematics, a basis function is an element of a particular basis for a function space. Every function in the function space can be represented as a linear combination of basis functions, just as every vector in a vector space can be represented as a linear combination of basis vectors.

In numerical analysis and approximation theory, basis functions are also called blending functions, because of their use in interpolation: In this application, a mixture of the basis functions provides an interpolating function (with the &quot;blend&quot; depending on the evaluation of the basis functions at the data points).

==Examples==

===Monomial basis for &quot;Cω&quot;===
The monomial basis for the vector space of analytic functions is given by 
formula_1

This basis is used in Taylor series, amongst others.

===Monomial basis for polynomials===
The monomial basis also forms a basis for the vector space of polynomials. After all, every polynomial can be written as formula_2 for some formula_3, which is a linear combination of monomials.

===Fourier basis for &quot;L&quot;2[0,1]===
Sines and cosines form an (orthonormal) Schauder basis for square-integrable functions on a bounded domain. As a particular example, the collection
formula_4
forms a basis for &quot;L&quot;2[0,1].

<text>Transform coding is a type of data compression for &quot;natural&quot; data like audio signals or photographic images. The transformation is typically lossless (perfectly reversible) on its own but is used to enable better (more targeted) quantization, which then results in a lower quality copy of the original input (lossy compression).

In transform coding, knowledge of the application is used to choose information to discard, thereby lowering its bandwidth. The remaining information can then be compressed via a variety of methods. When the output is decoded, the result may not be identical to the original input, but is expected to be close enough for the purpose of the application.

==Colour television==
=== NTSC ===
One of the most successful transform encoding system is typically not referred to as such—the example being NTSC color television. After an extensive series of studies in the 1950s, Alda Bedford showed that the human eye has high resolution only for black and white, somewhat less for &quot;mid-range&quot; colors like yellows and greens, and much less for colors on the end of the spectrum, reds and blues.

Using this knowledge allowed RCA to develop a system in which they discarded most of the blue signal after it comes from the camera, keeping most of the green and only some of the red; this is chroma subsampling in the YIQ color space.

The result is a signal with considerably less content, one that would fit within existing 6 MHz black-and-white signals as a phase modulated differential signal. The average TV displays the equivalent of 350 pixels on a line, but the TV signal contains enough information for only about 50 pixels of blue and perhaps 150 of red. This is not apparent to the viewer in most cases, as the eye makes little use of the &quot;missing&quot; information anyway.

=== PAL and SECAM ===
The PAL and SECAM systems use nearly identical or very similar methods to transmit colour. In any case both systems are subsampled.

==Digital==
The term is much more commonly used in digital media and digital signal processing. The most widely used transform coding technique in this regard is the discrete cosine transform (DCT), proposed by Nasir Ahmed in 1972, and presented by Ahmed with T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao in 1974. This DCT, in the context of the family of discrete cosine transforms, is the DCT-II. It is the basis for the common JPEG image compression standard, which examines small blocks of the image and transforms them to the frequency domain for more efficient quantization (lossy) and data compression. In video coding, the H.26x and MPEG standards modify this DCT image compression technique across frames in a motion image using motion compensation, further reducing the size compared to a series of JPEGs.

In audio coding, MPEG audio compression analyzes the transformed data according to a psychoacoustic model that describes the human ear&#x27;s sensitivity to parts of the signal, similar to the TV model. MP3 uses a hybrid coding algorithm, combining the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) and fast Fourier transform (FFT). It was succeeded by Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), which uses a pure MDCT algorithm to significantly improve compression efficiency.

The basic process of digitizing an analog signal is a kind of transform coding that uses sampling in one or more domains as its transform.

<text>William Carlos Williams (September 17, 1883 – March 4, 1963) was an American poet and physician of Latin American descent closely associated with modernism and imagism. His &quot;Spring and All&quot; (1923) was written in the wake of T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot; (1922). In his five-volume poem &quot;Paterson&quot; (1946–1958), he took Paterson, New Jersey as &quot;my &#x27;case&#x27; to work up. It called for a poetry such as I did not know, it was my duty to discover or make such a context on the &#x27;thought.&#x27;&quot; Some of his best known poems, &quot;This Is Just to Say&quot; and &quot;The Red Wheelbarrow&quot;, are reflections on the everyday. Other poems reflect the influence of the visual arts. He, in turn, influenced the visual arts; his poem &quot;The Great Figure&quot; inspired the painting &quot;I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold&quot; by Charles Demuth. Williams was awarded a posthumous Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for &quot;Pictures from Brueghel and Other Poems&quot; (1962).

Williams practiced both pediatrics and general medicine. He was affiliated with Passaic General Hospital, where he served as the hospital&#x27;s chief of pediatrics from 1924 until his death. The hospital, which is now known as St. Mary&#x27;s General Hospital, paid tribute to Williams with a memorial plaque that states &quot;We walk the wards that Williams walked&quot;. 

Randall Jarrell wrote that Williams &quot;feels, not just says, that the differences between men are less important than their similarities—that he and you and I, together, are the Little Men.&quot; Marc Hofstadter wrote that Williams &quot;sought to express his democracy through his way of speaking. His point was to speak on an equal level with the reader and to use the language and thought materials of America in expressing his point of view.&quot; Per Hugh Fox, Williams saw &quot;the &quot;real&quot; [original emphasis] function of the imagination as breaking through the alienation of the near at hand and reviving its wonder.&quot;

==Life and career==
Williams was born in Rutherford, New Jersey, in 1883. His father, William George Williams, was born in England but raised from &quot;a very young age&quot; in the Dominican Republic and &quot;was most comfortable speaking in Spanish, which was the primary language spoken in the Williams&#x27;s New Jersey household&quot;; his mother, Raquel Hélène Hoheb, from Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, was of French extraction. Williams&#x27;s maternal grandmother was named Emily Dickinson, though he was no relation to the poet of that name.

Scholars note that the Caribbean culture of the family home had an important influence on Williams. Jeffrey Herlihy-Mera observes, &quot;English was not his primary means of communication until he was a teenager. At home his mother and father—who were raised in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, respectively—spoke Spanish with each other and to young William Carlos.&quot; While he wrote in English, &quot;the poet&#x27;s first language&quot; was Spanish and his &quot;consciousness and social orientation&quot; were shaped by Caribbean customs; his life influenced &quot;to a very important degree by a plural cultural foundation.&quot;

John Keats and Walt Whitman were important early influences on Williams. Williams received his primary and secondary education in Rutherford until 1897 when he was sent for two years to a school near Geneva and to the Lycée Condorcet in Paris. He attended the Horace Mann School upon his return to New York City and, having passed a special examination, was admitted in 1902 to the medical school of the University of Pennsylvania, from which he graduated in 1906. Upon leaving Penn, Williams did internships at both French Hospital and Child&#x27;s Hospital in New York, then went to Leipzig for advanced study of pediatrics. He published his first book, &quot;Poems&quot;, in 1909.

Williams married Florence (&quot;Flossie&quot;) Herman (1891–1976) in 1912 after he returned from Germany. They moved into a house on 9 Ridge Road in Rutherford, New Jersey, where they resided for many years. Shortly afterward, his second book of poems, &quot;The Tempers&quot;, was published by a London press through the help of his friend Ezra Pound, whom he had met while studying at the University of Pennsylvania. Around 1914, Williams and his wife had their first son, William E. Williams, followed by their second son, Paul H. Williams, in 1917. William E. also became a physician.

Although his primary occupation was as a family doctor, Williams had a successful literary career as a poet. His work has a great affinity with painting, in which he had a lifelong interest. In addition to poetry (his main literary focus), he occasionally wrote short stories, plays, novels, essays, and translations. He practiced medicine by day and wrote at night. Early in his career, he briefly became involved in the Imagist movement through his friendships with Pound and H.D. (whom he had befriended during his medical studies at Penn), but soon he began to develop opinions that differed from theirs and his style changed to express his commitment to a modernist expression of his immediate environment. He was influenced by the &quot;inarticulate poems&quot; of his patients.

In 1920, Williams was sharply criticized by many of his peers (including H.D., Pound and Wallace Stevens) when he published one of his more experimental books &quot;Kora in Hell: Improvisations&quot;. Pound called the work &quot;incoherent&quot; and H.D. thought the book was &quot;flippant&quot;. The Dada artist and poet Baroness Elsa criticized Williams&#x27;s sexual and artistic politics in her experimental prose poem review titled &quot;Thee I call &#x27;Hamlet of Wedding Ring&#x27;&quot;, published in &quot;The Little Review&quot; in March 1921. Williams had an affair with the Baroness, and published three poems in &quot;Contact,&quot; describing the forty-year-old as &quot;an old lady&quot; with &quot;broken teeth [and] syphilis&quot;.

In 1923, Williams published &quot;Spring and All&quot;, one of his seminal books of poetry, which contained the classics &quot;By the road to the contagious hospital&quot;, &quot;The Red Wheelbarrow&quot; and &quot;To Elsie&quot;. However, in 1922, the publication of T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot; had become a literary sensation that overshadowed Williams&#x27;s very different brand of poetic modernism. In his &quot;Autobiography&quot;, Williams later wrote of &quot;the great catastrophe to our letters—the appearance of T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land.&quot;&quot; He said, 
I felt at once that &quot;The Waste Land&quot; had set me back twenty years and I&#x27;m sure it did. Critically, Eliot returned us to the classroom just at the moment when I felt we were on a point to escape to matters much closer to the essence of a new art form itself—rooted in the locality which should give it fruit. Although he respected the work of Eliot, Williams became openly critical of Eliot&#x27;s highly intellectual style with its frequent use of foreign languages and allusions to classical and European literature. Instead, Williams preferred colloquial American English.

During the 1930s, Williams began working on an opera. Titled &quot;The First President&quot;, it was focused on George Washington and his influence on the history of the United States of America and was intended to &quot;galvanize us into a realization of what we are today.&quot;

In &quot;Paterson&quot; (published between 1946 and 1958), an account of the history, people, and essence of Paterson, New Jersey, Williams wrote his own modern epic poem, focusing on &quot;the local&quot; on a wider scale than he had previously attempted. He also examined the role of the poet in American society and famously summarized his poetic method in the phrase &quot;No ideas but in things&quot; (found in his poem &quot;A Sort of a Song&quot; and repeated again and again in &quot;Paterson&quot;).

In his later years, Williams mentored and influenced many younger poets. He had a significant influence on many of the American literary movements of the 1950s, including the Beat movement, the San Francisco Renaissance, the Black Mountain school, and the New York School.

One of Williams&#x27;s more dynamic relationships as a mentor was with fellow New Jersey poet Allen Ginsberg. Williams included several of Ginsberg&#x27;s letters in &quot;Paterson&quot;, stating that one of them helped inspire the fifth section of that work. Williams also wrote the introduction to Ginsberg&#x27;s first book, &quot;Howl and Other Poems&quot; in 1956.

Williams suffered a heart attack in 1948, and after 1949, a series of strokes. Severe depression after one such stroke caused him to be confined to Hillside Hospital, New York, for four months in 1953. He died on March 4, 1963, at age 79 at his home in Rutherford. He was buried in Hillside Cemetery in Lyndhurst, New Jersey.

==Poetry==

The poet and critic Randall Jarrell stated of Williams&#x27;s poetry, William Carlos Williams is as magically observant and mimetic as a good novelist. He reproduces the details of what he sees with surprising freshness, clarity, and economy; and he sees just as extraordinarily, sometimes, the forms of this earth, the spirit moving behind the letters. His quick transparent lines have the nervous and contracted strength, move as jerkily and intently as a bird. R. P. Blackmur said of Williams&#x27;s poetry, &quot;the Imagism of 1912, self-transcended.&quot; A contemporary, Harriet Monroe, stated &quot;to assert his freedoms he must play the devil, showing himself rioting in purple and turquoise pools of excess.&quot;

Williams&#x27;s major collections are &quot;Spring and All&quot; (1923), &quot;The Desert Music and Other Poems&quot; (1954), &quot;Pictures from Brueghel and Other Poems&quot; (1962), and &quot;Paterson&quot; (1963, repr. 1992). His most anthologized poem is &quot;The Red Wheelbarrow&quot;, an example of the Imagist movement&#x27;s style and principles (see also &quot;This Is Just to Say&quot;). However, Williams, like his peer and friend Ezra Pound, had rejected the Imagist movement by the time this poem was published as part of &quot;Spring and All&quot; in 1923.

Williams is strongly associated with the American modernist movement in literature and saw his poetic project as a distinctly American one; he sought to renew language through the fresh, raw idiom that grew out of United States cultural and social heterogeneity, at the same time freeing it from what he saw as the worn-out language of British and European culture. “No one believes that poetry can exist in his own life,” Williams said. “The purpose of an artist, whatever it is, is to take the life, whatever he sees, and to raise it up to an elevated position where it has dignity.”

In 1920, Williams turned his attentions to &quot;Contact&quot;, a periodical launched by Williams and fellow writer Robert McAlmon: &quot;The two editors sought American cultural renewal in the local condition in clear opposition to the internationalists—Pound, &quot;The Little Review&quot;, and the Baroness.&quot; Yvor Winters, the poet/critic, judged that Williams&#x27;s verse bears a certain resemblance to the best lyric poets of the 13th century.

Williams sought to invent an entirely fresh and uniquely American form of poetry whose subject matter centered on everyday circumstances of life and the lives of common people. He came up with the concept of the &quot;variable foot&quot; which Williams never clearly defined, although the concept vaguely referred to Williams&#x27;s method of determining line breaks. &quot;The Paris Review&quot; called it &quot;a metrical device to resolve the conflict between form and freedom in verse.&quot;

One of Williams&#x27;s aims, in experimenting with his &quot;variable foot&quot;, was to show the American (opposed to European) rhythm that he claimed was present in everyday American language. Stylistically, Williams also worked with variations on a line-break pattern that he labeled &quot;triadic-line poetry&quot; in which he broke a long line into three free-verse segments. A well-known example of the &quot;triadic line [break]&quot; can be found in Williams&#x27;s love-poem &quot;Asphodel, That Greeny Flower.&quot;

In a review of Herbert Leibowitz&#x27;s biography of Williams, book critic Christopher Benfey wrote: Early and late, Williams held the conviction that poetry was, in his friend Kenneth Burke&#x27;s phrase, &quot;equipment for living, a necessary guide amid the bewilderments of life.&quot; The American ground was wild and new, a place where a blooming foreigner needed all the help he could get. Poems were as essential to a full life as physical health or the love of men and women.

==Williams and the painters==
Williams&#x27;s mother had trained as a painter in Paris and passed on her enthusiasm to her son, who also painted in his early years. A painting by him now hangs in Yale University&#x27;s Beinecke Library and as late as 1962 he was still remembering in an interview that &quot;I&#x27;d like to have been a painter, and it would have given me at least as great a satisfaction as being a poet.&quot; For most of his life Williams wrote art criticism and introductions to exhibitions by his friends.

In 1915, Williams began to associate with the New York group of artists and writers known as &quot;The Others.&quot; Founded by the poet Alfred Kreymborg and the artist Man Ray, they included Walter Conrad Arensberg, Wallace Stevens, Mina Loy, Marianne Moore, Orrick Glenday Johns and Marcel Duchamp. Interlocking with them were the US artists who met at Arensburg&#x27;s studio, including Marsden Hartley, Joseph Stella, Charles Demuth and Charles Sheeler, with whom Williams developed close friendships.

Although he championed the new way of seeing and representation pioneered by the European avant-garde, Williams and his artistic friends wished to get away from what they saw as a purely derivative style. As one result, he started &quot;Contact&quot; magazine with Hartley in 1920 in order to create an outlet for works showcasing the belief that creative work should derive from the artist&#x27;s direct experience and sense of place and reject traditional notions of how this should be done.

Precisionism emerged in response to such thinking. In her study of the influence of painting on Williams, Ruth Grogan devoted several paragraphs to the dependency of some of his poems on the paintings of Charles Sheeler in this style, singling out in particular the description of a power house in Williams&#x27;s &quot;Classic Scene&quot;. But the close relationship with Charles Demuth was more overt. Williams&#x27;s poem &quot;The Pot of Flowers&quot; (1923) references Demuth&#x27;s painting &quot;Tuberoses&quot; (1922), which he owned. On his side, Demuth created his &quot;I saw the figure 5 in gold&quot; (1928) as a homage to Williams&#x27;s poem &quot;The Great Figure&quot; (1921). Williams&#x27;s collection &quot;Spring and All&quot; (1923) was dedicated to the artist and, after his early death, he dedicated the long poem &quot;The Crimson Cyclamen.&quot; (1936) to Demuth&#x27;s memory.

Later collaborations with artists include the two poem/ two drawing volume that he shared with William Zorach in 1937 and his poem &quot;Jersey Lyric&quot;, written in response to Henry Niese&#x27;s 1960 painting of the same title: 
Throughout his career, Williams thought of his approach to poetry as a painterly deployment of words, saying explicitly in an interview, &quot;I&#x27;ve attempted to fuse the poetry and painting, to make it the same thing….A design in the poem and a design in the picture should make them more or less the same thing.&quot; However, in the case of his references to much earlier painters, culminating in &quot;Pictures from Brueghel&quot; (1962), his approach was more commentarial. Of this late phase of his work it has been claimed that &quot;Williams saw these artists solving, in their own ways, the same problems that concerned him,&quot; but his engagement with them was at a distance.

==Legacy, awards and honors==

The U.S. National Book Award was reestablished in 1950 with awards by the book industry to authors of books published in 1949 in three categories. Williams won the first National Book Award for Poetry, recognizing both the third volume of &quot;Paterson&quot; and &quot;Selected Poems&quot;.

In 1952, Williams was named Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress in Washington, DC, but was barred from serving out his term due to unfounded accusations of Williams&#x27;s membership in a communist organization. Williams retained legal counsel to refute the charges but was never allowed to respond to his critics and never received an apology from the Library of Congress. The next year, however, he received the Bollingen Prize along with Archibald MacLeish.

In May 1963, he was posthumously awarded the Pulitzer Prize for &quot;Pictures from Brueghel and Other Poems&quot; (1962) and the gold medal for Poetry of the National Institute of Arts and Letters. The Poetry Society of America presents the William Carlos Williams Award annually for the best book of poetry published by a small, non-profit or university press.

Williams&#x27;s house in Rutherford was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. He was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2009.
