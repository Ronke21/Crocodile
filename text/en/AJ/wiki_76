<text>The Last Man is an apocalyptic, dystopian science fiction novel by Mary Shelley, first published in 1826. The narrative concerns Europe in the late 21st century, ravaged by the rise of a bubonic plague pandemic that rapidly sweeps across the entire globe, ultimately resulting in the near-extinction of humanity. It also includes discussion of the British state as a republic, for which Shelley sat in meetings of the House of Commons to gain insight to the governmental system of the Romantic era. The novel includes many fictive allusions to her husband Percy Bysshe Shelley, who drowned in a shipwreck four years before the book&#x27;s publication, as well as their close friend Lord Byron, who had died two years previously.

&quot;The Last Man&quot; is one of the first pieces of dystopian fiction published. It was critically savaged and remained largely obscure at the time of its publication. It was not until the 1960s that the novel resurfaced for the public.

==Characters==
Lionel Verney: The Last Man. The orphan son of an impoverished nobleman, Lionel is originally lawless, self-willed, and resentful of the nobility for casting aside his father. When he is befriended by Adrian, however, he embraces civilization and particularly scholarship. Verney is largely an autobiographical figure for Mary Shelley.

Adrian, Earl of Windsor: Son of the last King of England, Adrian embraces republican principles. He is motivated by philosophy and philanthropy, rather than ambition. He is based on Percy Bysshe Shelley.

Lord Raymond: An ambitious young nobleman, Raymond becomes famous for his military efforts on behalf of Greece against the Turks, but eventually chooses love over his ambition to become King of England. He instead becomes Lord Protector of England before returning to Greece. Raymond is motivated by passion and ambition rather than principle. He is based on Lord Byron.

Perdita: Lionel&#x27;s sister, and Raymond&#x27;s wife. Growing up an orphan, Perdita was independent, distrustful, and proud, but she is softened by love for Raymond, to whom she is fiercely loyal.

Idris: Adrian&#x27;s sister, and Lionel&#x27;s wife. She is loving, maternal, and self-sacrificing.

Countess of Windsor: Mother of Adrian and Idris, an Austrian princess and former Queen of the United Kingdom. She is haughty and ambitious, scheming to restore the monarchy through her children.

Evadne Zaimi: A Greek princess with whom Adrian falls in love, but who loves Raymond. She is devoted and proud, even when she becomes impoverished.

Clara: Daughter of Raymond and Perdita.

Alfred and Evelyn: Sons of Lionel and Idris.

Ryland: Leader of the popular democratic party, Ryland has grand plans for the abolition of nobility before the plague, but is unwilling to govern England during the plague.

Merrival: An astronomer who is oblivious to the plague, instead speculating about the condition of the Earth in six thousand years, until his family dies. Broken by his tragedy, he dies not long afterwards.

Lucy Martin: A young woman who chose to marry a repulsive suitor rather than wait for her true love, to provide for her ageing mother. Her devotion to her mother almost leads to her being left behind in England after the exile.

The Imposter: Unnamed – a false prophet (from ambition, rather than fanaticism) who creates a radical religious sect in opposition to Adrian while in France.

Juliet: A young noblewoman who joins the Imposter&#x27;s party to support her baby, but is later killed revealing his imposture.

==Plot summary==

===Introduction===
Mary Shelley states that in 1818 she discovered, in a cave near Naples, prophetic writings painted on leaves by the Cumaean Sibyl. She says she has edited these writings into the narrative of a man living at the end of the 21st century, commencing in 2073 and concluding in 2100.

===Volume 1===
Lionel&#x27;s father was a friend of the king before he was cast away because of his gambling. Lionel&#x27;s father left to take his life, but before he did so he left a letter for the king to take care of his family after his death. After Lionel&#x27;s father died the letter was never delivered. Lionel and his sister grow up with no parental influence and become uncivilised. Lionel develops a hatred of the royal family, and Perdita grows to enjoy her isolation from society.
When the king leaves the throne, the monarchy comes to an end and a republic is created. When the king dies, the Countess attempts to raise their son, Adrian, to reclaim the throne. However, Adrian opposes his mother and refuses to take the throne. He moves to Cumberland where Lionel, who bears a grudge against Adrian and his family for the neglect of the Verney family, intends to confront Adrian. He is mollified by Adrian&#x27;s good nature and his explanation that he only recently discovered the letter. The two become close friends, and Lionel becomes civilised under Adrian&#x27;s influence. Adrian assists Lionel in pursuing political endeavours in Vienna which Lionel accepts and leaves for 2 years but chooses to return to England because he has not heard from either Adrian or his sister.

Lionel returns to England to face the personal turmoil amongst his acquaintances. Lord Raymond, who came to be renowned for his exploits in a war between Greece and Turkey, has returned to England searching for a political position. Perdita and Evadne soon fall in love with him. On discovering that his beloved, Evadne, is in love with Raymond, Adrian goes into exile, presumably mad. Raymond intends to marry Idris (with whom Lionel is in love) as a first step towards becoming king, with the help of the Countess. However, he ultimately chooses his love for Perdita over his ambition, and the two marry. Under Lionel&#x27;s care, Adrian recovers but remains physically weak. On learning of the love between Idris and Lionel, the Countess schemes to drug Idris, bring her to Austria, and force her to make a politically motivated marriage. Idris discovers the plot and flees to Lionel, who marries her soon after. The Countess leaves for Austria, resentful of her children and of Lionel.

Adrian and the others live happily together until Raymond runs for Lord Protector and wins. Perdita adjusts to her newfound social position, while Raymond becomes well-beloved as an administrator. He discovers, however, that Evadne, after the political and financial ruin of her husband (on account of her own political schemes) lives in poverty in London, unwilling to plead for assistance. Raymond attempts to support Evadne by employing her artistic skills in secrecy, and later nursing her in illness, but Perdita learns of the relationship and suspects infidelity. Her suspicions arouse Raymond&#x27;s proud nature, and the two separate. Raymond resigns his position and leaves to rejoin the war in Greece, accompanied by Adrian. Shortly after a wounded Adrian returns to England, rumours arise that Raymond has been killed. Perdita, loyal nonetheless, convinces Lionel to bring her and Clara to Greece to find him.

===Volume 2===
Arriving in Athens, Lionel learns that Raymond had been captured by the Ottomans, and negotiates his return to Greece. Shortly after this, Lionel and Raymond return to the Greek army and fight their way to Constantinople. After a decisive battle near Constantinople&#x27;s gates, Lionel discovers Evadne, who was wounded while fighting in the war. Before dying, Evadne prophesies Raymond&#x27;s death, a prophecy which confirms his own suspicions. Raymond&#x27;s intention to enter Constantinople causes dissension and desertion amongst the army because of reports of the plague. Raymond goes alone to find that Constantinople has been seemingly deserted and soon dies in an explosion, the result of a trap laid by the Turks. He is taken to a site near Athens for burial. Perdita refuses to leave Greece, but Lionel drugs her and brings her aboard a steamship, believing it to be in the best interests of Clara. Perdita awakens and, distraught at Raymond&#x27;s death, throws herself overboard and drowns.

In 2092, while Lionel and Adrian attempt to return their lives to normality, the plague continues to spread across Europe and the Americas. The appearance of a black sun causes panic throughout the world, and storm surges flood coastal towns across Europe. At first, England is thought to be safe, but soon the plague reaches it. Ryland, recently elected Lord Protector, is unprepared for the plague, and flees northward, later dying alone amidst a stockpile of provisions. Adrian takes command and is largely effective at maintaining order, although the plague rages on summer after summer. Ships arrive in Ireland carrying survivors from America, who lawlessly plunder Ireland and Scotland before invading England. Adrian raises a military force against them and ultimately manages to resolve the situation peacefully.

===Volume 3===
The few remaining survivors decide to abandon England, looking for an easier climate. On the eve of their departure to Dover, Lionel receives a letter from Lucy Martin, who could not join the exiles because of her mother&#x27;s illness. Lionel and Idris travel through a snowstorm to assist Lucy. Idris, weak from years of stress and maternal fears, dies along the way during the fierce weather. Lionel brings her body to Windsor Castle, interring her in St George&#x27;s Chapel, and is met by the Countess, who reconciles with Lionel at Idris&#x27; tomb. Lionel recovers Lucy (whose mother has died), and the party reaches Dover en route to France.

In France, Adrian learns the earlier emigrants have divided into factions, amongst them a fanatical religious sect led by a false messiah who claims his followers will be saved from disease. Adrian unites most of the factions, but the fanatics declare their opposition to Adrian. Lionel sneaks into Paris, where the cult has settled, to try to rescue Juliet. She refuses to leave because the impostor has her baby but helps Lionel escape after the impostor&#x27;s followers imprison him. Later, when her baby sickens, Juliet discovers the impostor has been hiding the effects of the plague from his followers. She is killed warning the other followers. The impostor commits suicide, and his followers return to the main body of exiles at Versailles.

The exiles travel towards Switzerland, hoping to spend the summer in a colder climate less favourable to the plague. By the time they reach Switzerland, however, all but four (Lionel, Adrian, Clara, and Evelyn) have died. They spend a few relatively happy seasons at Switzerland, Milan, and Como before Evelyn dies of typhus. The survivors attempt to sail across the Adriatic Sea from Venice to Greece, but a storm destroys the boat and drowns Clara and Adrian. Lionel swims to shore at Ravenna. Fearing to be the last human left on Earth, Lionel follows the Apennine Mountains to Rome, befriending a sheepdog along the way. A year passes without anyone else entering Rome, and Lionel resolves to leave with his dog and live the rest of his life as a wanderer of the depopulated continents of Africa and Asia looking for other survivors. The story ends in the year 2100.

==Themes==

===Biographical elements===
Many of the central characters are wholly or partially based upon Shelley&#x27;s acquaintances. Shelley had been forbidden by her father-in-law, Sir Timothy Shelley, from publishing a biography of her husband, so she memorialised him, amongst others, in &quot;The Last Man&quot;. The utopian Adrian, Earl of Windsor, who leads his followers in search of a natural paradise and dies when his boat sinks in a storm, is a fictional portrait of Percy Bysshe Shelley, although other minor characters such as Merrival bear traces of Percy as well.
Lord Raymond, who leaves England to fight for the Greeks and dies in Constantinople, is based on Lord Byron. The novel expresses Mary Shelley&#x27;s pain at the loss of her community of the &quot;Elect&quot;, as she called them, and Lionel Verney has been seen as an outlet for her feelings of loss and boredom following their deaths and the deaths of her children.

It appears that Shelley found inspiration for the title of her novel in Jean-Baptiste Cousin de Grainville&#x27;s &quot;Le Dernier Homme&quot; (1805), translated into English in 1806 as &quot;Omegarus and Syderia&quot;.

===Failure of romantic political ideals===
&quot;The Last Man&quot; not only laments the loss of Shelley&#x27;s friends, but also questions the Romantic political ideals for which they stood. In a sense, the plague is metaphorical, since the revolutionary idyll of the élite group is corroded from within by flaws of human nature. As literary scholar Kari Lokke writes, &quot;in its refusal to place humanity at the center of the universe, its questioning of our privileged position in relation to nature, then, &quot;The Last Man&quot; constitutes a profound and prophetic challenge to Western humanism.&quot; Specifically, Mary Shelley, in making references to the failure of the French Revolution and the Godwinian, Wollstonecraftian, and Burkean responses to it, &quot;attacks Enlightenment faith in the inevitability of progress through collective efforts&quot;.

===Isolation===
Hugh Luke argues, &quot;By ending her story with the picture of the Earth&#x27;s solitary inhabitant, she has brought nearly the whole weight of the novel to bear upon the idea that the condition of the individual being is essentially isolated and therefore ultimately tragic&quot; (xvii). Shelley shares this theme of tragic isolation with the poetry of Lord Byron and William Wordsworth.

===Science and medicine===
Just as her earlier and better-known novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1818) engaged with scientific questions of electromagnetism, chemistry, and materialism, &quot;The Last Man&quot; finds Shelley again attempting to understand the scope of scientific inquiry. Unlike the earlier novel&#x27;s warnings about Faustian over-reaching, this novel&#x27;s devastating apocalypse strongly suggests that medicine had become too timid and ultimately come too late. The ineffectual astronomer Merrival, for example, stands in stark contrast to the frighteningly productive Victor Frankenstein. Shelley&#x27;s construction of Lionel Verney&#x27;s immunity remains a subject of significant critical debate, but the novel certainly demonstrates a deep understanding of the history of medicine, specifically the development of the smallpox vaccine and the various nineteenth-century theories about the nature of contagion.

=== Politics ===
Eileen Hunt Botting of the University of Notre Dame has stated that the novel &quot;saw that the disaster of a pandemic would be driven by politics,&quot; and that the &quot;spiraling health crisis would be caused by what people and their leaders had done and failed to do on the international stage—in trade, war and the interpersonal bargains, pacts and conflicts that precede them.&quot; Botting has further described the novel as identifying &quot;three patterns of modern democratic corruption, which would be exposed and exacerbated by a pandemic:

&lt;poem&gt;1. slow yet steady institutional erosion of norms and practices of trust and equality;
2. authoritarian forms of populism that betray the people who bring an executive leader to power; and
3. patriarchal and religious forms of populism that manipulate the people&#x27;s beliefs through fear and disinformation.&lt;/poem&gt;

The novel also comments on the racism expressed by imperial European nations towards the rest of the world. According to Olivia Murphy of the University of Sydney, the novel shows that &quot;this sense of racial superiority and immunity is unfounded: all people are united in their susceptibility to the fatal disease.&quot;

==Publication history==
&quot;The Last Man&quot; followed several other last-man themed works including a French narrative () (1805), Byron&#x27;s poem &quot;Darkness&quot; (1816), and Thomas Campbell&#x27;s poem &quot;The Last Man&quot; (1824). (Campbell claimed Byron had taken his own poem from Campbell&#x27;s idea.)

Two editions of &quot;The Last Man&quot; were published by Henry Colburn in London on 23 January 1826, and one edition in Paris in 1826 by Galignani. A pirated edition was printed in the United States of America in 1833. 

The novel was not reprinted until 1965.

== Reception ==
=== Contemporary reception ===
&quot;The Last Man&quot; received the worst reviews of all of Mary Shelley&#x27;s novels: most reviewers derided the very theme of lastness, which had become a common one in the previous two decades. Individual reviewers labelled the book &quot;sickening&quot;, criticised its &quot;stupid cruelties&quot;, and called the author&#x27;s imagination &quot;diseased&quot;. The reaction startled Mary Shelley, who promised her publisher a more popular book next time. Nonetheless, she later spoke of &quot;The Last Man&quot; as one of her favourite works.

=== Later reception ===
In the 20th century it received new critical attention, perhaps because the notion of lastness had become more relevant.

The novel received a further surge in attention in the 2020s. Rebecca Barr of the University of Cambridge wrote that the novel was &quot;an astonishing work&quot; that &quot;resonates with contemporary feelings of climate grief as well as the sense of helplessness as we confront COVID-19.&quot; Eileen Hunt Botting of the University of Notre Dame described the book as Shelley&#x27;s &quot;second great work of science fiction,&quot; saying that it provided &quot;an existential mind-set for collectively dealing with the threat of a global man-made disaster.&quot;

<text>The Transmigration of Timothy Archer is a 1982 novel by American writer Philip K. Dick. As his final work, the book was published shortly after his death in March 1982, although it was written the previous year. 

The novel draws on autobiographical details of Dick&#x27;s friendship with the controversial Episcopal bishop James Pike, on whom the title character is loosely based. It continues Dick&#x27;s investigation into the religious and philosophical themes of &quot;VALIS&quot;.

The novel was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1982.

==Plot==
Set in the late 1960s and 1970s, the story describes the efforts of Episcopal bishop Timothy Archer, who must cope with the theological and philosophical implications of the newly discovered Gnostic Zadokite scroll fragments. The character of Bishop Archer is loosely based on the controversial, iconoclastic Episcopal bishop James Pike, who in 1969 died of exposure while exploring the Judean Desert near the Dead Sea in the West Bank.

As the novel opens, it is 1980. On the day that John Lennon is shot and killed, Angel Archer visits the houseboat of Edgar Barefoot, (a guru based on Alan Watts), and reflects on the lives of her deceased relatives. During the sixties, she was married to Jeff Archer, son of the Episcopal Bishop of California Timothy Archer. She introduced Kirsten Lundborg, a friend, to her father-in law, and the two began an affair. Kirsten has a son, Bill, from a previous relationship, who has schizophrenia, although he is knowledgeable as an automobile mechanic. Tim is already being investigated for his allegedly heretical views about the Holy Ghost.

Jeff commits suicide due to his romantic obsession with Kirsten. However, after poltergeist activity, he manifests to Tim and Kirsten at a seance, also attended by Angel. Angel is skeptical about the efficacy of astrology, and believes that the unfolding existential situation of Tim and Kirsten is akin to Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s German Romanticism era masterpiece, the Wallenstein trilogy (insofar as their credulity reflects the loss of rational belief in contemporary consensual reality).

The three are told that Kirsten and Tim will die. As predicted, Kirsten loses her remission from cancer, and also commits suicide after a barbiturate overdose. Tim travels to Israel to investigate whether or not a psychotropic mushroom was associated with the resurrection, but his car stalls, he becomes disoriented, falls from a cliff, and dies in the desert.

On the houseboat, Angel is reunited with Bill, Kirsten&#x27;s son who has schizophrenia. He claims to have Tim&#x27;s reincarnated spirit within him, but is soon institutionalized. Angel agrees to care for Bill, in return for a rare record (&quot;Koto Music&quot; by Kimio Eto) that Edgar offers her.

&quot;The Transmigration of Timothy Archer&quot; is one of Dick&#x27;s most overtly philosophical and intellectual works. While Dick&#x27;s novels usually employ multiple narrators or an omniscient perspective, this story is told in the first person by a single narrator: Angel Archer, Bishop Archer&#x27;s daughter-in-law.

==Characters==
*Angel Archer: Narrator, manager of a Berkeley record store, widow of Jeff Archer.
*Timothy Archer: Bishop of California; father of the late Jeff Archer and father-in-law of Angel. Dies in Israel, searching for psychotropic mushroom connected with Zadokite sect. Based on James Albert Pike, Dick&#x27;s personal friend, who was an American Episcopalian bishop.
*Kirsten Lundborg: Timothy Archer&#x27;s secretary and lover. Dies from barbiturate overdose after loss of remission from cancer.
*Bill Lundborg: Kirsten&#x27;s son who has schizophrenia, and who is obsessed with cars.
*Edgar Barefoot: Houseboat guru, radio personality, lecturer. Based on Alan Watts.
*Jeff Archer: Son of Timothy Archer, and deceased husband of Angel. A professional student who was romantically obsessed with Kirsten.

==Other works==
&quot;The Transmigration of Timothy Archer&quot; is thematically related to Dick&#x27;s unfinished VALIS trilogy of novels:

* &quot;VALIS&quot; (1981)
* &quot;The Divine Invasion&quot; (1981)

The novel has been included in several omnibus editions of the trilogy as a stand-in for the unwritten final volume. &quot;The Transmigration of Timothy Archer&quot; was not intended by Dick to be part of the trilogy; however, the book fits with the two finished volumes and Dick himself called the three novels a trilogy, saying &quot;the three do form a trilogy constellating around a basic theme.&quot;

The book was originally titled &quot;Bishop Timothy Archer&quot;.

<text>Ukonline was a &quot;portal&quot; website of the Government of the United Kingdom linking to public sector information, and was originally called me.gov. The site was launched in 2001 and maintained by the Office of the e-Envoy (later the e-Government Unit, part of the Cabinet Office). It replaced the earlier single online government website, the Government Information Service (GIS) hosted at open.gov.uk, which had been established in November 1994. The need for an updated single government website had been identified in a 1999 Portal Feasibility Study prepared by PA Consulting for the Central IT Unit (CITU) in the Cabinet Office.

The site featured news, links, and search facilities connecting together much of the government&#x27;s web presence, though later this pan-government search facility was removed. Visitors to the site were able to search for information on a variety of topics (for example, agriculture, finance and health) and retrieve a list of government departments that were able to provide them with more information. It was also possible to do such things as apply for a passport, buy a television licence, register to vote or complete and send a Tax Self Assessment form, but only if users left the website, as they could not actually perform the transaction on UKonline.

The site was replaced in 2004 by the service Directgov, which was then replaced in 2012 by the service Gov.uk.

<text>Elizabeth Joan Jennings (18 July 1926 – 26 October 2001) was a British poet.

==Life and Career==
Elizabeth Jennings was born at The Bungalow, Tower Road, Skirbeck, Boston, Lincolnshire, younger daughter of physician Henry Cecil Jennings (1893–1967), MA, BSc (Oxon.), MB BS (Lond.), DPH, medical officer of health for Oxfordshire, and (Helen) Mary, née Turner. When she was seven, her family moved to Oxford, where she remained for the rest of her life. There she later attended St Anne&#x27;s College. After graduation, she became a writer.
Jennings&#x27;s early poetry was published in journals such as &quot;Oxford Poetry&quot;, &quot;New English Weekly&quot;, &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;Outposts&quot; and &quot;Poetry Review&quot;, but her first book of poems was not published until she was 27. The lyrical poets she cited as having influenced her were Hopkins, Auden, Graves and Muir. Her second book, &quot;A Way of Looking&quot; (155), won the Somerset Maugham Award and marked a turning point, as the prize money allowed her to spend nearly three months in Rome, which was a revelation. It brought a new dimension to her religious belief and inspired her imagination.

Regarded as traditionalist rather than an innovator, Jennings is known for her lyric poetry and mastery of form. Her work displays a simplicity of metre and rhyme shared with Philip Larkin, Kingsley Amis and Thom Gunn, all members of the 1950s group of English poets known as The Movement. She always made it clear that, while her life, which included a spell of severe mental illness, contributed to the themes contained within her work, she did not write explicitly autobiographical poetry. Her deeply held Roman Catholicism coloured much of her work.

She had difficulty managing the practical aspects of her career and life. She became impoverished and struggled with mental health, and her personal difficulties tarnished her critical reputation. When she was honoured by the queen in 1992, she wore a &quot;knitted hat, duffle coat, and canvas shoes&quot;. The tabloid newspapers mocked her as &quot;the bag-lady of the sonnets&quot;, and the unfortunate description stayed with her. She spent the later years of her life in various short-term lodgings and in Unity House (8 St Andrew&#x27;s Lane) in Old Headington. She died in a care home in Bampton, Oxfordshire, at the age of 75. She is buried in Wolvercote Cemetery, Oxford.

Her life and career were reviewed in 2018 by Dana Gioia, who said: &quot;Despite her worldly failures, her artistic career was a steady course of achievement. Jennings ranks among the finest British poets of the second half of the twentieth century. She is also England’s best Catholic poet since Gerard Manley Hopkins.&quot;

<text>Anarcho-syndicalism is an anarchist organisational model that centres trade unions as a vehicle for class conflict. Drawing from the theory of libertarian socialism and the practice of syndicalism, anarcho-syndicalism sees trade unions as both a means to achieve immediate improvements to working conditions and to build towards a social revolution in the form of a general strike, with the ultimate aim of abolishing the state and capitalism. Anarcho-syndicalists consider trade unions to be the prefiguration of a post-capitalist society and seek to use them in order to establish workers&#x27; control of production and distribution. An anti-political ideology, anarcho-syndicalism rejects political parties and participation in parliamentary politics, considering them to be a corrupting influence on the labour movement. In order to achieve their material and economic goals, anarcho-syndicalists instead practice direct action in the form of strike actions, boycotts and sabotage. Anarcho-syndicalists also attempt to build solidarity among the working class, in order to unite workers against the exploitation of labour and build workers&#x27; self-management.

The foundations of anarcho-syndicalism were laid by the anti-authoritarian faction of the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association (IWMA) and developed by the French General Confederation of Labour (CGT). Anarcho-syndicalism was constituted as a specific tendency following the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam in 1907, which led to anarcho-syndicalism becoming the dominant form of trade union organisation in Europe and Latin America. After facing suppression during the Revolutions of 1917–1923, anarcho-syndicalists established the International Workers&#x27; Association (IWA) in 1922. Anarcho-syndicalism reached its apex during the Spanish Revolution of 1936, when the National Confederation of Labour (CNT) established an anarcho-syndicalist economy throughout much of the Spanish Republic. Anarcho-syndicalism went into decline after the defeat of the anarchists in the Spanish Civil War in 1939. The movement split into two factions: the &quot;orthodox&quot; faction, which held to traditional syndicalist principles in spite of changing material conditions; and the &quot;revisionist&quot; faction, which aimed to achieve a mass base and work within the framework of newly-established welfare states. By the end of the 20th century, the rise of neoliberalism and the collapse of the Eastern Bloc had led to a revival in anarcho-syndicalism, with syndicalist unions once again being established throughout the globe.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The history of anarcho-syndicalism can be traced back to the anarchist faction of the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association (IWA), which called for trade unions to overthrow the state in a general strike. This syndicalist model of trade union organisation was adopted by anarchists in Spain, Cuba, Mexico and the United States, where syndicalism became the dominant organisational form. Elsewhere, the development of reformist tendencies such as social democracy sidelined anarchists within trade unions. But tensions between rank-and-file trade unionists and their social-democratic leadership eventually gave way to the development of revolutionary syndicalism, which called for workers themselves to take direct action in order to improve their own material conditions.

===Growth of syndicalism===

Revolutionary syndicalism was first propagated in France, where the &quot;Bourses du Travail&quot; () were established to provide mutual aid to workers and organise strike actions. By the 20th century, the &quot;bourses&quot; had joined together to establish the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), which rose to include 60% of French workers within its ranks. But after the CGT launched a general strike, which won French workers the eight-hour day and the weekend, the union turned away from revolutionary syndicalism towards reformism. However, by this time, revolutionary syndicalism had already spread throughout Europe, with syndicalist unions being established in the Netherlands, Italy, Portugal, Germany and Sweden. The concurrent development of industrial unionism led to the establishment of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in countries throughout the English-speaking world. By the 1910s, syndicalism had spread throughout every country in Europe and anarchist tendencies started to develop within the movement.

===Development of anarcho-syndicalism===

Although anarchists widely participated in the syndicalist movement, syndicalists were divided into separate tendencies, many of which rejected the ideological prescriptions of anarchism. At the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam, convened by the anarcho-syndicalist Christiaan Cornelissen in 1907, a conflict between the two tendencies broke out; while the syndicalist Pierre Monatte and the anarchist Errico Malatesta debated their respective ideologies, Amédée Dunois attempted to synthesise the two into a &quot;workers&#x27; anarchism&quot;. Anarcho-syndicalism soon became the dominant form of trade union organisation in Spain, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay and many other Latin American countries, where anarcho-syndicalists organised a series of general strikes for the eight-hour day. Attempts to establish international links between these anarcho-syndicalist organisations culminated in the convocation of a revolutionary syndicalist congress in 1913, although further movements towards the creation of an international organisation were halted by the outbreak of world war.

===War and Revolution===

The outbreak of World War I split anarcho-syndicalists into internationalist and defencist camps; the former declared themselves against both sides of the war, while the latter supported the Allies against the Central Powers. The conflict ultimately demonstrated the inability of the international syndicalist movement to prevent war and discredited &quot;neutral syndicalism&quot; in the eyes of many workers, causing revolutionary sentiments to once again begin rising within the workers&#x27; movement. When the Revolutions of 1917–1923 spread throughout Europe, anarcho-syndicalists became keen participants in the revolutionary wave, during which they faced rising political repression. Anarcho-syndicalists in Europe, Latin America and Asia organised general strikes, sometimes reaching revolutionary proportions, but were ultimately suppressed by nationalist or communist dictatorships.

=== Apex ===

Following the suppression of their movements and the rising influence of Marxism-Leninism throughout the world, anarcho-syndicalists moved to establish their own international organisation: the International Workers&#x27; Association (IWA). Theoretical discussions within the IWA led to debates on the issues of platformism, insurrectionism, industrialism and reformism, while the Spanish National Confederation of Labour (CNT) rose to prominence in the Spanish Republic. With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, the CNT led the defeat of the Nationalists in Catalonia, where they ignited an anarcho-syndicalist revolution that collectivised three-quarters of the Republican economy. The CNT&#x27;s decision to join the Republican government caused controversy within the IWA and the social revolution was eventually suppressed by the government. The Republicans ultimately lost the war and the Spanish anarcho-syndicalists were imprisoned, killed or forced into exile by the victorious Francoist dictatorship.

===Post-war decline===

During World War II, anarcho-syndicalists initially adopted an &quot;internationalist&quot; position, taking up the slogan &quot;Neither Fascism, nor Antifascism.&quot; But following the Nazi occupation of Europe and the subsequent suppression of their organisations, anarcho-syndicalists throughout Europe reorientated themselves towards anti-fascism and joined the anti-fascist resistance. After the war, anarcho-syndicalism experienced a rapid decline, as anarcho-syndicalist unions were either marginalised by rising social corporatism or repressed by newly-established authoritarian states. Anarcho-syndicalists proved unable to keep up with the changes in the post-war capitalist system, which hastened the decline of the anarcho-syndicalist movement and forced its organisations to choose between marginalisation, reform or dissolution. Despite the economic changes, the IWA chose to reaffirm traditional anarcho-syndicalist principles, causing its Dutch and Swedish sections to split from it. The SAC chose to revise its principles in order to adapt to the new Swedish welfare state, within which they aimed to establish workers&#x27; control over welfare and the democratisation of the economy. The IWA declined to its lowest point during the 1960s, as its membership became increasingly preoccupied with theory.

===Contemporary revival===

The anarcho-syndicalist movement began to experience a revival in the wake of the protests of 1968 and the Spanish transition to democracy. While the Spanish CNT experienced a rapid growth, new anarcho-syndicalist organisations were established throughout Europe. As globalisation and neoliberalism led to the dismantling of welfare states in the West, while the Eastern Bloc collapsed, anarcho-syndicalists once again began to present libertarian socialism as a necessary alternative to the state and capitalism. By the turn of the 21st century, anarcho-syndicalism had experienced a resurgence, as anarcho-syndicalist organisations re-emerged throughout the globe. Existing anarcho-syndicalist unions once again began taking direct action and organising strikes, while new anarcho-syndicalist unions established large support bases and achieved social reforms.

==Theory==

The political theory of anarcho-syndicalism is based on the foundations of libertarian socialism, as formulated by the anti-authoritarian faction of the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association, while its organisational forms were adopted from revolutionary syndicalism, which was first put into practice by the French labour movement in the early 20th century.

Anarcho-syndicalism is distinguished from other forms of syndicalism by its anarchist political philosophy, where other syndicalist tendencies distance themselves from anarchism or even deny any political alignment. Other varieties of syndicalism include: the &quot;neutral&quot; revolutionary syndicalism, which separates itself from other political theories; Daniel De Leon&#x27;s conception of industrial unionism, which infused it with a Marxist influence; and an authoritarian form of syndicalism developed by Georges Sorel, which advocates for vanguardism and mythmaking to drive the masses towards a general strike.

Anarcho-syndicalism also distinguishes itself from other forms of anarchism, due to its favourability towards industrialisation and organisation. While other forms of anarchism reject economic centralisation and the division of labour, considering the ideal of a stateless society to be one of decentralised, small-scale social units, anarcho-syndicalism foresees trade unions as taking over a large-scale and centralised industrial economy. Anarcho-syndicalists believe that the establishment of a syndicalist system could lead to the withering away of the state and as such to anarchy and communism. Some support the temporary establishment of a collectivist system of distribution &quot;to each according to their contribution&quot;, until a state of post-scarcity is achieved, at which point it would give way to an anarchist communist system of distribution &quot;from each according to their ability, to each according to their needs&quot;.

In the contemporary period, anarcho-syndicalism is divided into two main factions: the &quot;orthodox&quot; faction, which rejects any diversity of tactics or collaboration with statist forces, in favour of waiting for the right conditions for a revolutionary situation; and the &quot;revisionist&quot; faction, which is open to participation in systems of social welfare and pursues gradual reforms towards the democratisation of the economy.

===Anti-politics ===
Anarcho-syndicalism is an apolitical or anti-political ideology, opposed to the formation of socialist political parties and participation in parliamentary politics. Anarcho-syndicalists argue that socialist participation in politics, rather than moving society closer to socialism, has damaged the labour movement by substituting self-help for representation. They have further criticised socialist parties for abandoning anti-capitalism in favour of nationalism, which they believe to have resulted in the reinforcement of capitalism and the integration of the labour movement into the nation state. To anarcho-syndicalists, political careerism corrupted socialist politicians, while electoralism transformed socialism from a constructive project into a reformist one. Anarcho-syndicalists are thus opposed to unions affiliating with political parties and attempt to prevent the capture of unions by party politicians. From this position, anarcho-syndicalists have denounced Bolshevism as a vehicle for authoritarianism and state capitalism, and criticised social democrats for bureaucratic inaction.

===Trade unionism===
Anarcho-syndicalists see trade unions not only as a means by which workers can organise for immediate improvements to their living and working conditions; but also as a means of training workers for management, with the goal of establishing workers&#x27; control over production and the creation of a socialist economy. Anarcho-syndicalists believe that trade unions are better suited for these tasks than socialist political parties, as workers often still require trade unions to protect their rights even under socialist governments. Anarcho-syndicalists consider trade unions to be the vanguard of the labour movement; they believe workers&#x27; power resides in the economic sphere, as they are responsible for producing the wealth that society relies upon. For anarcho-syndicalists, trade unions represent the prefiguration of a future socialist economy, the foundation that a new syndicalist society will be built on. Workers&#x27; education is therefore at the centre of anarcho-syndicalism, which aims to use trade unions to prepare workers to take over management of the industrial economy.

===Federalism===

Anarcho-syndicalism organises itself according to the principles of federalism and free association, in which the self-determination of each individual is upheld. Anarcho-syndicalists are staunchly opposed to centralised, hierarchical forms of organisation, which they believe stifle independent initiative with bureaucracy. In anarcho-syndicalist organisations, individual unions carry out their activities on a voluntary basis; for any larger-scale activity that requires delegation, representatives are typically elected for single terms and are paid the same amount as the workers they represent. Anarcho-syndicalists believe that centralism weakens and inhibits workers&#x27; capacity to take independent action and make decisions, and that centralised organisations inevitably tend towards inertia and stagnation. In contrast, they believe that federalist organisations provide workers with both the means to take rapid action in individual struggles and also connections that could allow them to establish workers&#x27; control of the economy and society in a social revolution.

According to the anarcho-syndicalist model, federal organisations are built from the bottom-up, on both a territorial and industrial basis: first, workers join together in independent trade unions; the trade unions in a given city or district then combine into a cartel, which act as centres for popular education and build solidarity between workers of different trades; the cartels then group together on a regional basis, up to the national level, providing larger-scale coordination between its member organisations. Under this model, each trade union is also federatively linked with other unions of the same trade and related trades in industrial unions, which allow workers a greater scope of solidarity actions in struggles relevant to their economic sector. Anarcho-syndicalists see this federative form of industrial organisation as the nucleus for the reorganisation of the economy and society, as it would be able to take over the management of production in every economic sector. In such a revolutionary situation, cartels would take over production in their communities, determine the needs of their local population and organise the economy to meet those needs. A national federation would likewise be able to organise production throughout a given country to meet the needs of the entire populace nationwide, while the industrial unions established workers&#x27; control over the means of production and transportation.

==Practice==
In contrast to political parties that seek to enhance the political power of states over society, anarcho-syndicalists aim to restrict the ability of the state to act and influence society. Anarcho-syndicalism also seeks to abolish capitalism and replace it with socialism, which it does by lowering the profit margins of business owners and raising the workers&#x27; share in the product of their own labour. Anarcho-syndicalists consider the state to be a result of class stratification, established and maintained in order to protect the monopoly of capitalists over the economy. As such, anarcho-syndicalists predict that the dissolution of the state will be an inevitable consequence of the abolition of capitalism. While moving towards this, they also consider it necessary to protect the civil and political rights that workers have achieved from political reaction.

Anarcho-syndicalism is driven by the practice of direct action, which eschews legalistic methods in favour of workers forcing their employers to make concessions. Methods of direct action include boycotts, sabotage and strike actions, the latter of which syndicalists framed as a &quot;revolutionary drill&quot; to prepare workers for the overthrow of capitalism and the state.

<doc id="49940" wikidata="Q1306985" url="?curid=49940" title="Aaron's rod">
<text>Aaron&#x27;s rod () refers to any of the walking sticks carried by Moses&#x27; brother, Aaron, in the Torah. The Bible tells how, along with Moses&#x27;s rod, Aaron&#x27;s rod was endowed with miraculous power during the Plagues of Egypt that preceded the Exodus. Later, his rod miraculously sprouted blossoms and almonds to symbolize God&#x27;s choice of Aaron and his tribe for holy service.

The flowering staff of Aaron in the biblical narrative may be an etiology of the asherah cultic object. Aaron’s rod, originally associated with priestly and magical powers, may have been later transferred to Moses in various biblical accounts, demonstrating his authority and divine empowerment.

==Biblical references==

In Israelite culture, the rod ( &quot;maṭṭeh&quot;) was a natural symbol of authority, as the tool used by the shepherd to correct and guide his flock. Moses, in fact, initially carried his rod while tending his sheep, and later it became his symbol of authority over the Israelites.

The rods of both Moses and Aaron were endowed with miraculous power during the Plagues of Egypt. God commanded Moses to raise his rod over the Red Sea when it was to be split and in prayer over Israel in battle; at Meribah Moses brought forth water from a stone using his rod.
Aaron&#x27;s rod – perhaps a different rod – reappears in . Here Korah&#x27;s rebellion against Moses&#x27;s proclamation of the tribe of Levi as the priesthood has been quashed and the entire congregation&#x27;s ensuing rebellion has resulted in a plague, ended only by the intercession of Moses and Aaron. In order to &quot;stop the complaints&quot; of the Israelites, God commands that each of the Twelve Tribes provide a rod; and only that of the tribe chosen to become priests will miraculously sprout overnight. Aaron provides his rod to represent the tribe of Levi, and &quot;it put forth buds, produced blossoms, and bore ripe almonds&quot;, as an evidence of the exclusive right to the priesthood of the tribe of Levi. In commemoration of this decision, it was commanded that the rod be stored &quot;before the testimony&quot;.

Aaron&#x27;s rod is cited as exhibiting miraculous power on its own, when not physically held by its owner. In , Aaron &quot;cast down his rod&quot; and it became a serpent. When he does so, the Pharaoh&#x27;s sorcerers counter by similarly casting down their own rods, which also become serpents, but Aaron&#x27;s rod swallowed them all. Similarly, in it sprouted blossoms when not being held.

==In Rabbinical literature==
Rabbinic midrash described attributes of Aaron&#x27;s rod beyond those in the Biblical text.

It is reported that the rod was made of sapphire, weighed forty seahs (a seah = 10.70 pounds), and bore the inscription דצ״ך עד״ש באח״ב (the initials of the Hebrew names of the Ten Plagues).

God created it in the twilight of the sixth day of Creation, and delivered it to Adam when the latter was driven from paradise. After it had passed through the hands of Shem, Enoch, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob successively, it came into the possession of Joseph. On Joseph&#x27;s death the Egyptian nobles stole some of his belongings, and, among them, Jethro appropriated the staff. Jethro planted the staff in his garden, when its marvelous virtue was revealed by the fact that nobody could withdraw it from the ground (compare &quot;the sword in the stone&quot;); even to touch it was fraught with danger to life. This was because the Ineffable Name of God was engraved upon it. When Moses entered Jethro&#x27;s household he read the Name, and by means of it was able to draw up the rod, for which service Zipporah, Jethro&#x27;s daughter, was given to him in marriage. Her father had sworn that she should become the wife of the man who should be able to master the miraculous rod and of no other.

Aaron&#x27;s rod, together with its blossoms and fruit, was preserved in the Ark. King Josiah, who foresaw the impending national catastrophe, concealed the Ark and the objects stored with it (Aaron&#x27;s rod, a vial of manna, and the holy anointing oil). Their whereabouts will remain unknown until, in the Messianic age, the prophet Elijah shall reveal them.

As discussed, the Bible ascribes similar miraculous powers to rods of Aaron and Moses. One midrash goes a step further, and identifies them as being the same rod:
The rod with which Jacob crossed the Jordan () is the same rod which was in Judah&#x27;s hand (), which was in Moses&#x27;s hand (), which was in Aaron&#x27;s hand (), which was in David&#x27;s hand (). which was in the hand of each king until the destruction of the Temple, when it was hidden. When the Messiah comes it will be given to him for a scepter in token of his authority over the nations.

According to one midrash, Moses split a tree trunk into twelve portions, and gave one portion to each tribe. When the Rod of Aaron produced blossoms, the Israelites could not but acknowledge the significance of the token. This opinion seemingly assumes that the rod in Korach&#x27;s rebellion was separate from the rod used for the plagues.

==Christian use==
Hebrews 9:4 states that Aaron&#x27;s rod was kept in the Ark of the Covenant.

The account of the blossoming of Aaron&#x27;s rod contained in Clement&#x27;s first letter to the Corinthians (ep. 43) is in haggadic-midrashic style, and may probably be ascribed to Jewish or, more strictly speaking, Jewish-Hellenistic sources. According to that account, Moses placed upon each of the twelve staffs the corresponding seal of the head of a tribe. The doors of the sanctuary were similarly sealed, to prevent anyone from having access to the rods at night.

The miraculous flowering of the rod was also considered a type of the Incarnation of Christ and his Virgin Birth, and appears in scenes of the Annunciation to Mary.

In the Ethiopian fourteenth-century text of the Kebra Nagast, Aaron&#x27;s rod is broken in three and probably a symbol of the Trinity: &quot;The rod of Aaron which sprouted after it had become withered though no one watered it with water, and one had broken it in two places, and it became three rods being [originally only] one rod.&quot;

== Islamic literature ==
Accounts of Aaron&#x27;s rod appear in Islamic literature. A depiction from al-Tha&#x27;labi&#x27;s (d. 1035, AH 427) Stories of the Prophets depicts Harun (Aaron) leaning on his rod, while his brother Musa&#x27;s (Moses) staff miraculously turned into a snake-dragon to defeat Pharaoh&#x27;s magicians.

== In modern literature ==
D. H. Lawrence entitled a novel &quot;Aaron&#x27;s Rod&quot; in 1922. This book describes a flautist, Aaron Sissons, and his experiences as he journeys through a Europe exhausted by the First World War. The biblical eponymous reference, with the flute representing a magic rod, is intended to be ironic.

<text>Theurgy (; from the Greek θεουργία ), also known as divine magic, is one of two major branches of the magical arts, the other being practical magic or thaumaturgy. Theurgy describes the ritual practices associated with the invocation or evocation of the presence of one or more deities, especially with the goal of achieving henosis (uniting with the divine) and perfecting oneself.

== Definitions ==
*Proclus (): theurgy is &quot;a power higher than all human wisdom embracing the blessings of divination, the purifying powers of initiation and in a word all the operations of divine possession.&quot;
*Keith Thomas: &quot;Spiritual magic or theurgy was based on the idea that one could reach God in an ascent up the scale of creation made possible by a rigorous course of prayer, fasting and devotional preparation.&quot;
*Pierre A. Riffard: &quot;Theurgy is a type of magic. It consists of a set of magical practices performed to evoke beneficent spirits in order to see them or know them or in order to influence them, for instance by forcing them to animate a statue, to inhabit a human being (such as a medium), or to disclose mysteries.&quot;

== Neoplatonism ==

&quot;Theurgy&quot; means &quot;divine working&quot;. The first recorded use of the term is found in the mid-second-century neoplatonist work the &quot;Chaldean Oracles&quot; (Fragment 153 des Places (Paris, 1971): &#x27;For the theourgoí do not fall under the fate-governed herd&#x27;). The source of Western theurgy can be found in the philosophy of late neoplatonists, especially Iamblichus. Although the neoplatonists are often considered pagan polytheists, they embraced a form of monism.

In late neoplatonism, the spiritual universe is regarded as a series of emanations from the One. From the One emanated the Divine Mind (Nous) and in turn from the Divine Mind emanated the World Soul (Psyche). Neoplatonists insisted that the One is absolutely transcendent and in the emanations nothing of the higher was lost or transmitted to the lower, which remained unchanged by the lower emanations.

For Plotinus and Porphyry the emanations are as follows:
* To Hen (), The One: Deity without quality, sometimes called The Good.
* Nous (), Mind: The universal consciousness, from which proceeds
* Psychē (), Soul: Including both individual and world soul, leading finally to
* Physis (), Nature.

Plotinus urged contemplations for those who wished to perform theurgy, the goal of which was to reunite with the Divine (called henosis). Therefore, his school resembles a school of meditation or contemplation.

=== Iamblichus ===
Iamblichus, a student of Anatolius and Porphyry (the latter himself was a student of Plotinus), taught a more ritualized method of theurgy that involved invocation and religious, as well as magical, ritual. Iamblichus believed theurgy was an imitation of the gods, and in his major work, &quot;On the Mysteries of the Egyptians, Chaldeans, and Assyrians&quot;, he described theurgic observance as &quot;ritualized cosmogony&quot; that endowed embodied souls with the divine responsibility of creating and preserving the cosmos.

Iamblichus&#x27; analysis was that the transcendent cannot be grasped with mental contemplation because the transcendent is supra-rational. Theurgy is a series of rituals and operations aimed at recovering the transcendent essence by retracing the divine &#x27;signatures&#x27; through the layers of being. Education is important for comprehending the scheme of things as presented by Aristotle, Plato, and Pythagoras. The theurgist works &#x27;like with like&#x27;: at the material level, with physical symbols; at the higher level, with mental and purely spiritual practices. Starting with correspondences of the divine in matter, the theurgist eventually reaches the level where the soul&#x27;s inner divinity unites with the One.

=== Emperor Julian ===
The Emperor Julian (332-363) embraced neoplatonic philosophy and worked to replace Christianity with a version of neoplatonic paganism. Because of his untimely death and the hold mainstream Christianity had over the empire at the time, this was ultimately unsuccessful, but he did produce several works of philosophy and theology, including a popular hymn to the sun. In his theology, Helios, the sun, was the ideal example of the perfection of the gods and light, a symbol of divine emanation. He also held the mother goddess Cybele in high esteem.

Julian favored ritual theurgy, with an emphasis on sacrifice and prayer. He was heavily influenced by Iamblichus&#x27; ideas.

== In Western esotericism ==

=== Esoteric Christianity ===
Esoteric Christianity accepts theurgy as a tradition that could greatly benefit a person. The main feat of Esoteric Christianity is to learn the mysteries of God (see Raziel) and to rise to higher consciousness in the understanding of God&#x27;s relationship to individual consciousness. Theurgy, in the esoteric tradition, uses this knowledge to heighten one&#x27;s own spiritual nature. Some branches of Esoteric Christianity hold that if an Esoteric Christian, Rosicrucian, or Theosopher practices it they could potentially rise to the degree of Magus or Adept after a certain level of spiritual attainment. In a traditional and magical sense, theurgy is seen as the opposite of Goetia, even though many argue that they overlap.

==== Radical orthodoxy ====
John Milbank, founder of radical orthodoxy, asserts that theology &quot;encourages a theurgy which aims at a liberation of nature from terror and distress and at a fully harmonious and beautiful interaction between humans and the natural world&quot;. He continues by stating that theology equally &quot;encourages a theurgy which is a social work of maximising democratic participation and socialist sharing&quot;.

===Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn===

Some organizations, such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, teach a type of theurgy that would help one ascend spiritually as well as understand the true nature of the self and its relation to the Divine and the Universe. This tradition holds that theurgists are usually solitary practitioners who seek the divine light alone. Theurgy in this hermetic sense stresses the need for the individual to separate and analyze the individual components that constitute everyday consciousness and reunite them in a way that changes one&#x27;s personal awareness into a state that understands and partakes in spiritual grace.

<text>William Spencer Vickrey (21 June 1914 – 11 October 1996) was a Canadian-American professor of economics and Nobel Laureate. He was a lifelong faculty member at Columbia University. A theorist who worked on public economics and mechanism design, Vickrey primarily discussed public policy problems. He originated the Vickrey auction, introduced the concept of congestion pricing in networks, formalized arguments for marginal cost pricing, and contributed to optimal income taxation. James Tobin described him as &quot;an applied economist’s theorist, as well as a theorist’s applied economist.”

Vickrey was awarded the 1996 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with James Mirrlees for their research into the economic theory of incentives under asymmetric information. Vickrey never personally received the Prize; it was announced just three days prior to his death.

== Early years ==
Vickrey was born in Victoria, British Columbia to Charles Vernon Vickrey, a Congregationalist minister, and Ada Eliza Spencer. The family moved to New York City in William&#x27;s childhood, where his father was General Secretary of the American Committee for Armenian and Syrian Relief, one of the nation&#x27;s first humanitarian assistance organizations.

Vickrey attended high school at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. After obtaining his B.S. in Mathematics at Yale University in 1935, he went on to complete his M.A. at Columbia University in 1937. He stayed at Columbia for a PhD, which he completed 1948 with a 500-page dissertation entitle &quot;An Agenda for Progressive Taxation.&quot; Vickrey&#x27;s doctoral work was interrupted by World War II, when he was enlisted to work for the U.S. National Resources Planning Board and later the Treasury Department&#x27;s Division of Tax Research.

==Career==
Vickrey remained at Columbia for his entire career. His students included the economists Jacques Drèze, Harvey J. Levin, and Lynn Turgeon.

===Contributions===
Vickrey was the first to use the tools of game theory to explain the dynamics of auctions. In his seminal paper, Vickrey derived several auction equilibria, and provided an early revenue-equivalence result. The revenue equivalence theorem remains the centrepiece of modern auction theory. The Vickrey auction is named after him.

Vickrey worked on congestion pricing, the notion that roads and other services should be priced so that users see the costs that arise from the service being fully used when there is still demand. Congestion pricing gives a signal to users to adjust their behavior or to investors to expand the service in order to remove the constraint. The theory was later partially put into action in London.

In public economics, Vickrey extended the marginal cost pricing approach of Harold Hotelling and showed how public goods should be provided at marginal cost. He contended that efficient funding for public utilities and transportation systems required short-run marginal pricing, or pricing responsive to current demand.

Alongside marginal cost pricing, Vickrey argued that the land value tax was necessary to efficiently fund city services. He wrote that replacing taxes on production and labor (&quot;including property taxes on improvements&quot;) with fees for holding valuable land sites &quot;would substantially improve the economic efficiency of the jurisdiction&quot;. Vickrey further argued that land value tax had no adverse effects and that replacing existing taxes in this way would increase local productivity enough that land prices would rise instead of fall. He also made an ethical argument for Georgist value capture, noting that owners of valuable locations still take (exclude others from) local public goods, even if they choose not to use them, so without land value tax, land users have to pay twice for those public services (once in tax to government and once in rent to holders of land title).

Vickrey&#x27;s economic philosophy was influenced by John Maynard Keynes and Henry George. He was sharply critical of the Chicago school of economics and was vocal in opposing the political focus on achieving balanced budgets and fighting inflation, especially in times of high unemployment. Working under General MacArthur, Vickrey helped accomplish radical land reform in Japan.

===Nobel Prize award and death===
Vickrey&#x27;s Nobel Prize in Economics was announced on October 8, 1996. He became the only Nobel laureate born in British Columbia. 

Vickrey died three days later while traveling to a conference of Georgist academics that he helped found. His Columbia University economics department colleague C. Lowell Harriss accepted the posthumous prize on his behalf. There are only three other cases where a Nobel Prize has been presented posthumously: Erik Axel Karlfeldt (Literature 1931), Dag Hammarskjöld (Peace 1961) and Ralph Steinman (Physiology or Medicine 2011).

== Personal life ==
Vickrey married Cecile Thompson in 1951. He was a Quaker and a member of Scarsdale Friends Meeting. He died in Harrison, New York in 1996 from heart failure.

<text>The Gododdin () were a Brittonic people of north-eastern Britannia, the area known as the Hen Ogledd or Old North (modern south-east Scotland and north-east England), in the sub-Roman period. Descendants of the Votadini, they are best known as the subject of the 6th-century Welsh poem &quot;Y Gododdin&quot;, which memorialises the Battle of Catraeth and is attributed to Aneirin.

The name &quot;Gododdin&quot; is the Modern Welsh form, but the name appeared in Old Welsh as &quot;Guotodin&quot; and derived from the tribal name &quot;Votadini&quot; recorded in Classical sources, such as in Greek texts from the Roman period.

==Kingdom==
It is not known exactly how far the kingdom of the Gododdin extended, possibly from the Stirling area to the kingdom of &quot;Bryneich&quot; (Bernicia), and including what are now the Lothian and Borders regions of eastern Scotland. It was bounded to the west by the Brittonic Kingdom of Strathclyde, and to the north by the Picts. Those living around Clackmannanshire were known as the Manaw Gododdin. According to tradition, local kings of this period lived at both Traprain Law and Din Eidyn (Edinburgh, whose English name is ultimately a calque, with the Old English &#x27; corresponding to the Welsh &#x27;; in Scottish Gaelic it is still known as &#x27;), and probably also at &#x27; (Dunbar, Scottish Gaelic &quot;&quot;). Gododdin included districts such as Manaw Gododdin and Eidyn south of the Firth of Forth.

Cunedda, legendary founder of the Kingdom of Gwynedd in north Wales, is supposed to have been a Manaw Gododdin warlord who migrated southwest during the 5th century.

==Later history==
In the 6th century, Bryneich was invaded by the Angles and became known as Bernicia. The Angles continued to press north. In around 600 the Gododdin raised a force of about 300 men to assault the Angle stronghold of Catraeth, perhaps Catterick, North Yorkshire. The battle, which ended disastrously for the Britons, was memorialised in the poem &quot;Y Gododdin&quot;.

In 638, Eidyn, modern Edinburgh, was under siege and fell to the Angles, for the Gododdin seem to have come under the rule of Bernicia around this time. To what extent the native population was replaced or assimilated is unknown. Bernicia became part of Northumbria. Shortly afterwards this came under a unified England, then in 1018 Malcolm II brought the region as far as the River Tweed under Scottish rule.

<text>Prudence (, contracted from meaning &quot;seeing ahead, sagacity&quot;) is the ability to govern and discipline oneself by the use of reason. It is classically considered to be a virtue, and in particular one of the four cardinal virtues (which are, with the three theological virtues, part of the seven virtues). Prudentia is an allegorical female personification of the virtue, whose attributes are a mirror and snake, and who is frequently depicted as a pair with Justitia, the Roman goddess of Justice.

The word derives from the 14th-century Old French word , which, in turn, derives from the Latin meaning &quot;foresight, sagacity&quot;. It is often associated with wisdom, insight, and knowledge. The virtue of prudence is the ability to judge between virtuous and vicious actions, not only in a general sense, but with regard to appropriate actions at a given time and place. Although prudence itself does not perform any actions, and is concerned solely with knowledge, all virtues are regulated by it. For example, distinguishing when acts are courageous, as opposed to reckless or cowardly, is an act of prudence.

In modern English, the word &quot;prudence&quot; has become closely associated with cautiousness. In this sense, prudence is a virtue that involves taking calculated risks, but excessive caution can become a vice of cowardice.

In the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;, Aristotle gives a lengthy account of the virtue ()—traditionally translated as &quot;prudence&quot;, although this has become problematic as the modern usage of that word has changed. More recently has been translated by such terms as &quot;practical wisdom&quot;, &quot;practical judgment&quot;, or &quot;rational choice&quot;.

== As the &quot;mother&quot; of all virtues ==
Prudence was considered by the ancient Greeks and later by Christian philosophers, most notably Thomas Aquinas, as the cause, measure, and form of all virtues. It is considered to be the or the charioteer of the virtues. It is mentioned in the fifth of the Principal Doctrines of Epicurus, and in his Letter to Menoeceus, where he says: &quot;Prudence is the foundation of all these things and is the greatest good. Thus it is more valuable than philosophy and is the source of every other excellence.&quot;

Prudence is foundational to virtues, which are understood to be perfected abilities of the human spirit. This perfection is achieved when virtues are founded on prudence, or the ability to make the right decisions. For instance, a person can live temperately when he has acquired the habit of deciding correctly the actions to take in response to his instinctual cravings.

Prudence provides guidance on the appropriate course of action in specific situations. It does not &quot;will&quot; the good that it discerns. Prudence has a directive capacity with regard to the other virtues. It lights the way and measures the arena for their exercise. Without prudence, bravery becomes foolhardiness, mercy sinks into weakness, free self-expression and kindness into censure, humility into degradation and arrogance, selflessness into corruption, and temperance into fanaticism. The purpose of prudence is to consider the circumstances of time, place, and manner that are relevant in any given situation, known as &quot;medium rationis&quot; in the Scholastic tradition. So while it qualifies the intellect and not the will, it is nevertheless a moral virtue.

Prudence provides a model of ethically good actions. &quot;The work of art is true and real by its correspondence with the pattern of its prototype in the mind of the artist. In similar fashion, the free activity of man is good by its correspondence with the pattern of prudence.&quot; (Josef Pieper)

According to Greek and Scholastic philosophy, &#x27;form&#x27; is the unique characteristic of a thing that makes it what it is. In this sense, prudence gives other virtues their specific character as virtues, by providing a standard against which they can be judged. For example, not all acts of telling the truth are considered virtuous, but those that are done with prudence would be considered expressions of the virtue of honesty. 

== Versus imprudence, cunning and false prudence ==

In Christian understanding, the difference between prudence and cunning lies in the intent with which a decision to act is made. The Christian understanding of the world includes the existence of God, the natural law, and moral implications of human actions. In this context, prudence is different from cunning in that it takes into account the supernatural good. For instance, the decision of persecuted Christians to be martyred rather than deny their faith is considered prudent.

According to Thomas Aquinas, judgments that take a reasonable form, but are aimed at evil ends or that use evil means, are considered to be examples of &quot;cunning&quot; and &quot;false prudence&quot;.

The Ancient Greek term for prudence is synonymous with &quot;forethought&quot;. People, the Ancient Greeks believed, must have enough prudence to prepare for worshiping the Olympian gods.

== Integral parts ==

Prudence is the application of universal principles to particular situations. &quot;Integral parts&quot; of virtues, in Scholastic philosophy, are the elements that must be present for any complete or perfect act of the virtue. The following are the integral parts of prudence:
; : accurate memory; that is, memory that is true to reality; an ability to learn from experience
; : an open-mindedness that recognizes variety and is able to seek and make use of the experience and authority of others
; : the understanding of first principles
; : shrewdness or quick-wittedness, the ability to evaluate a situation quickly
; : discursive reasoning and the ability to research and compare alternatives
; : foresight—the capacity to estimate whether particular actions can realize goals
; circumspection : the ability to take all relevant circumstances into account
; caution : the ability to mitigate risk

== Prudential judgment ==

In ethics, a &quot;prudential judgment&quot; is one where the circumstances must be weighed to determine the correct action. This applies to situations in which two people could weigh the circumstances differently and &quot;ethically&quot; come to different conclusions.

For instance, in the theory of just war, the government of a nation must weigh whether the harms they suffer are more than the harms that would be produced by their going to war against another nation that is harming them; the decision whether to go to war is therefore a prudential judgment.

As another example, a patient with a terminal illness may hear of an experimental treatment with no conventional alternatives. They would have to weigh, on the one hand, the cost, time commitment, potential lack of benefit, and possible pain, disability, and hastened death, and on the other hand, the potential benefit and the benefits to others that could be gained from what could be learned from their case.

== In rhetoric ==

, or practical wisdom, holds an important place in rhetorical theory as a central aspect of judgment and practice. Aristotle&#x27;s notion of fits with his treatise on rhetoric because neither, in his estimation, could be reduced to an or a , and both deal with the ability to deliberate about contingent, variable, or indeterminate matters.

Cicero defined as a rhetorical norm in &quot;De Oratore&quot;, &quot;De officiis&quot;, &quot;De Inventione&quot;, and &quot;De re publica&quot;. He contrasts the term with , young men failing to consider the consequences before they act. The , or those who had prudence, knew when to speak and when to stay silent. Cicero maintained that prudence was gained only through experience, and while it was applied in everyday conversation, in public discourse it was subordinated to the broader term for wisdom, .

In the modern era, rhetorical scholars have tried to recover a robust meaning for the term. They have maintained consistency with the ancient orators, contending that prudence is an embodied persuasive resource. Although sets of principles or rules can be constructed in a particular culture, prudence cannot be derived from a set of timeless principles. Instead, through gauging the situation and through reasoned deliberation, a speaker should determine the set of values and morals by which to base his or her actions. The capacity to take into account the particularities of the situation is vital to prudential practice. For example, as rhetorical scholar Lois Self explains, &quot;both rhetoric and are normative processes in that they involve rational principles of choice-making; both have general applicability but always require careful analysis of particulars in determining the best response to each specific situation; both ideally take into account the wholeness of human nature; and finally, both have social utility and responsibility in that both treat matter of the public good&quot;. Robert Hariman, in his examination of Malcolm X, adds that &quot;aesthetic sensibility, imitation of a performative ideal, and improvisation upon conventions of presentation&quot; are also components of practical reasoning.

Rhetorical scholars differ on definitions of the term and methods of analysis. Hans-Georg Gadamer asserted that prudence materializes through the application of principles and can be evaluated accordingly. Jasinski argues that Andrew Cuomo&#x27;s speech to the Catholic Church of Notre Dame cannot be judged solely on the basis of its consequences, since prudence is not reducible to &quot;episteme&quot; (knowledge or understanding) or &quot;techne&quot; (technique or art). Rather, he contends, it should be judged based on its embodied rhetorical performance — that is, how it is perceived by those who experience it. So, for example, one might evaluate the speech based on how persuasive it was, how emotionally moving it was, or how well it captured the audience&#x27;s attention. Thus, while Gadamer judges prudence based on a set of principles, Jasinski emphasizes the artistry of communication and its reception by its audience. For Jasinski, communication should balance compromise and courage, rather than merely achieving a specific result.

In his study of Machiavelli, examining the relationship between prudence and moderation, rhetorician Eugene Garver holds that there is a middle ground between &quot;an ethics of principles, in which those principles univocally dictate action&quot; and &quot;an ethics of consequences, in which the successful result is all&quot;. His premise stems from Aristotle&#x27;s theory of virtue as an &quot;intermediate&quot;, in which moderation and compromise embody prudence. Yet, because elevating moderation is not an active response, prudence entails the &quot;transformation of moderation&quot; into a fitting response, making it a flexible situational norm. Garver also asserts that prudential reasoning differs from &quot;algorithmic&quot; and &quot;heuristic&quot; reasoning because it is rooted in a political community, the context in which common problems regarding stability and innovation arise and call for prudential reasoning.

== In economics ==
Economists describe a consumer as &quot;prudent&quot; if he or she saves more when faced with riskier future income. This additional saving is called precautionary saving.

If a risk-averse consumer has a utility function formula_1 over consumption formula_2, and if formula_1 is differentiable, then the consumer is not prudent unless the third derivative of utility is positive, that is, formula_4.

The strength of the precautionary saving motive can be measured by absolute prudence, which is defined as
formula_5. Similarly, relative prudence is defined as absolute prudence, multiplied by the level of consumption. These measures are closely related to the concepts of absolute and relative risk aversion developed by Kenneth Arrow and John W. Pratt.

== In accounting ==

In accounting, prudence was historically regarded as a fundamental principle for determining the appropriate timing of revenue recognition. The rule of prudence means that gains should not be anticipated unless their realisation was highly probable. However, recent developments in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles have led academic critics to accuse the International Standard-Setting Body, IASB, of abandoning prudence. In the British reporting standard FRS 18, prudence, along with consistency, was relegated to a &quot;desirable&quot; quality of financial information rather than fundamental concept. Prudence was rejected for IFRS because it was seen as compromising accounts&#x27; neutrality.

In a 2011 report on the financial crisis of 2007–08, the British House of Lords bemoaned the demotion of prudence as a governing principle of accounting and audit. However, their comments were disputed by prominent practitioners.

<doc id="49955" wikidata="Q7177" url="?curid=49955" title="Jean-Marie Le Pen">
<text>Jean Louis Marie Le Pen (20 June 1928 – 7 January 2025), commonly known as Jean-Marie Le Pen (), was a French politician, lawyer and activist. He founded the far-right National Front (now National Rally) party and served as the party&#x27;s president from 1972 to 2011 and as its honorary president from 2011 to 2015. 

He focused on issues related to immigration to France, the European Union, traditional culture and values, law and order, and France&#x27;s high rate of unemployment. His progression in the 1980s is known as the &quot; of minds&quot; due to its noticeable effect on mainstream political opinion. His controversial speeches and his integration into public life made him a figure who polarized opinion. He was convicted of statements downplaying the Holocaust, and fined for incitement to discrimination regarding remarks made about Muslims in France. He was expelled from the party by his daughter Marine in 2015 after making controversial statements.

Le Pen&#x27;s longevity in politics and his five attempts to become president of France made him a major figure in French political life. His unexpected progress to the second round in the 2002 presidential election—when he was beaten in a landslide by incumbent Jacques Chirac—left its mark on French public life, and the &quot;21st of April&quot; is now a frequently used expression in France. He served three terms in the National Assembly and was a member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1984 to 2019.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Jean Louis Marie Le Pen was the only son of Jean Le Pen (1901–1942). Jean Le Pen was born in Brittany, like his ancestors, and had started work at the age of 13 on a transatlantic vessel. He was the president of the Association des Anciens Combattants, a fisherman, and a municipal councillor of La Trinité-sur-Mer, a small seaside village in Brittany. Jean-Marie Le Pen&#x27;s mother, Anne-Marie Hervé (1904–1965), was a seamstress and also of local ancestry. His mother was a speaker of the Breton language, and Le Pen would say in his old age that his only regret was not to learn the language.

Le Pen was born in La Trinité-sur-Mer on 20 June 1928. He was orphaned as an adolescent (Ward of the Nation, brought up by the state), when his father&#x27;s boat &quot;La Persévérance&quot; was blown up by a mine in 1942. He was raised as a Roman Catholic and studied at the Jesuit in Vannes, then at the in Lorient.

In November 1944, aged 16, Le Pen was turned down (because of his age) by Colonel Henri de La Vaissière (then representative of the Communist Youth) when he attempted to join the French Forces of the Interior (FFI). He then entered the faculty of law in Paris, and started to sell the monarchist &quot;Action Française&quot; newspaper, &quot;Aspects de la France&quot;, in the street. He was repeatedly convicted of assault and battery (&quot;coups et blessures&quot;).

Le Pen started his political career as the head of the student union in Toulouse. He became president of the &quot;Association Corporative des étudiants en droit&quot;, an association of law students whose main occupation was to engage in street brawls against the &quot;cocos&quot; (communists). He was excluded from this organisation in 1951.

After his time in the military, Le Pen studied political science and law at Panthéon-Assas University. His graduate thesis, submitted in 1971 by him and Jean-Loup Vincent, was titled &quot;Le courant anarchiste en France depuis 1945&quot; (&quot;The anarchist movement in France since 1945&quot;).

===Military service===
After receiving his law degree, Le Pen enlisted in the Foreign Legion. He arrived in French Indochina after the 1954 battle of Dien Bien Phu, which France had lost and which prompted Prime Minister Pierre Mendès France to put an end to the Indochinese war at the Geneva Conference. Le Pen then was sent to the Suez in 1956, but arrived only after the cease-fire.

In 1953, a year before the beginning of the Algerian War, he contacted President Vincent Auriol, who approved Le Pen&#x27;s proposed volunteer disaster relief project after a flood in the Netherlands. Within two days, there were 40 volunteers from his university, a group that would later help victims of an earthquake in Italy. In Paris in 1956, he was elected to the National Assembly as a member of Pierre Poujade&#x27;s populist UDCA party. Le Pen often presented himself as the youngest member of the Assembly, but a young communist, , 27 years old and half a year younger, was elected in the same year.

In 1957, Le Pen became the general secretary of the , a veterans&#x27; organization. The next year, following his break with Poujade, he was re-elected to the National Assembly as a member of the Centre National des Indépendants et Paysans (CNIP) party, led by Antoine Pinay.

Le Pen claimed that he had lost his left eye when he was savagely beaten during the 1958 election campaign. Testimonies suggest that he was only wounded in the right eye and did not lose it. He lost the sight in his left eye years later, due to an illness. (Popular belief was that he wore a glass eye.) During the 1950s, Le Pen took a close interest in the Algerian War (which lasted from 1954 to 1962) and the French defence budget.

Elected to parliament under the Poujadist banner, Le Pen voluntarily reengaged himself for two to three months in the Foreign Legion. He was then sent to Algeria in 1957 as an intelligence officer. He was accused of having engaged in torture. Le Pen denied these accusations, although he admitted knowing of its use. Le Pen also criticised President Charles de Gaulle for granting Algeria independence, accusing him of &quot;helping make France small&quot;.

===Far-right politics===

He directed the 1965 presidential campaign of far-right candidate Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour, who obtained 5.19% of the votes. Le Pen insisted on the rehabilitation of the Collaborationists, declaring that:

In 1962, Le Pen lost his seat in the Assembly. In 1963, he created the &quot;&quot; (Serp), a company involved in the music industry that specialized in historical recordings and sold recordings of the choir of the CGT trade union and songs of the Popular Front, as well as Nazi marches.

===National Front===
In 1972, Le Pen founded the Front National (FN) party. He then ran in the 1974 presidential election, obtaining 0.74% of the vote. In 1976, his Paris flat was dynamited (he had been living at that time in his mansion of Montretout in Saint-Cloud). The crime was never solved. Le Pen then failed to obtain the 500 signatures from &quot;grand electors&quot; (&quot;grands électeurs&quot;, mayors, etc.) necessary to present himself in the 1981 presidential election, won by the candidate of the Socialist Party (PS), François Mitterrand.

Criticising immigration and taking advantage of the economic crisis striking France and the world since the 1973 oil crisis, Le Pen&#x27;s party managed to increase its support in the 1980s, starting in the municipal elections of 1983. His popularity was greatest in the south and east of France. The FN obtained 16 seats in the 1984 European elections. A total of 35 FN deputies – including Le Pen, who was elected for Paris – entered the National Assembly after the 1986 elections (the only legislative elections held under proportional representation), which were won by the right wing, bringing Jacques Chirac to Matignon in the first cohabitation government (that is, the combination of a right-wing prime minister, Chirac, with a socialist president, Mitterrand). 

In 1984, Le Pen won a seat in the European Parliament and was consistently reelected since then. In 1988 he lost his reelection bid for the National Assembly in Bouches-du-Rhône&#x27;s 8th constituency when he was defeated in the second round by Socialist . In 1991 Le Pen&#x27;s invitation to London by Conservative MPs was militantly protested by large numbers coordinated by the Campaign Against Fascism in Europe (CAFE), which led to a surge of anti-fascist groups and activity across Europe. In 1992 and 1998 he was elected to the Regional Council of Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur.

Le Pen ran in the presidential elections in 1974, 1988, 1995, 2002, and 2007. As noted above, he was not able to run for office in 1981, having failed to gather the necessary 500 signatures of elected officials. In the presidential elections of 2002, Le Pen obtained 16.86% of the votes in the first round of voting. This was enough to qualify him for the second round, as a result of the poor showing by the PS candidate and incumbent prime minister Lionel Jospin and the scattering of votes among 15 other candidates. This was a major political event, both nationally and internationally, as it was the first time someone with such far-right views had qualified for the second round of a French presidential election. There was a widespread stirring of national public opinion as virtually the entire French political spectrum from the centre-right to the left united in fierce opposition to Le Pen&#x27;s ideas. More than one million people in France took part in street rallies; slogans such as &quot;A crook is better than a fascist&quot; (&quot;Un escroc mieux qu&#x27;un facho&quot;) and &quot;Graft rather than hate, Chirac rather than Le Pen&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;arnaque plutôt que la haine, Chirac plutôt que Le Pen&quot;) were heard in opposition to Le Pen. Le Pen was then defeated by a large margin in the second round, when incumbent president Jacques Chirac obtained 82% of the votes, thus securing the biggest majority in the history of the Fifth Republic.

In the 2004 regional elections, Le Pen intended to run for office in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region but was prevented from doing so because he did not meet the conditions for being a voter in that region: he neither lived there nor was registered as a taxpayer there. However, he was planned to be the FN&#x27;s top candidate in the region for the 2010 regional elections.

Le Pen again ran in the 2007 presidential election and finished fourth. His 2007 campaign, at the age of 78 years and 9 months, made him the oldest candidate for presidential office in French history.

Le Pen was a vocal critic of the European Reform Treaty (formally known as the Treaty of Lisbon) which was signed by EU member states on 13 December 2007 and entered into force on 1 December 2009. In October 2007, Le Pen suggested that he would personally visit Ireland to assist the &quot;No&quot; campaign but finally changed his mind, fearing that his presence would be more of a hindrance than a benefit to the campaign. Ireland finally refused to ratify the treaty. Ireland was the only EU country that held a citizen referendum. All other EU states, including France, ratified the treaty by parliamentary vote, despite a previous citizen referendum where over 55% of French voters rejected the European Reform Treaty (although that vote was on a different draft of the Treaty in the form of the Constitutional Treaty). After the Irish &quot;No&quot; vote, Le Pen addressed the French President Nicolas Sarkozy in the European Parliament, accusing him of furthering the agenda of a &quot;cabal of international finance and free market fanatics&quot;. Ireland later accepted the treaty in a second Lisbon referendum.

After Le Pen left office in January 2011, his daughter Marine Le Pen was elected by the adherents of the party over Bruno Gollnisch. He became honorary chairman of the party and won his seat again at the European elections in 2014.

On 4 May 2015, Le Pen was suspended from the party after refusing to attend his disciplinary hearing for repeating his description of the Nazi gas chambers used in concentration camps during the Holocaust, as a &quot;detail&quot; of World War II and speaking favorably of Nazi collaborator Marshal Philippe Pétain. He had originally been fined 183,200 euros for saying in 1987 that &quot;I&#x27;m not saying the gas chambers didn&#x27;t exist. I haven&#x27;t seen them myself. I haven&#x27;t particularly studied the question. But I believe it&#x27;s just a detail in the history of World War II.&quot; In 1996, he stated that &quot;If you take a 1,000-page book on World War II, the concentration camps take up only two pages and the gas chambers 10 to 15 lines. This is what one calls a detail,&quot; and he made similar statements before the European Parliament in 2008 and 2009.

Le Pen dismissed the hearing as a &#x27;mockery&#x27; and an &#x27;ambush&#x27; and accused Ms. Le Pen of pulling the strings from afar. &#x27;It&#x27;s dirty to kill your own daddy, so she didn&#x27;t kill daddy directly, she did it through her henchman,&#x27; Mr. Le Pen told French radio at the time. The elder Le Pen was a persistent problem for his daughter as she tried to smooth over the overt racism and xenophobia of the party&#x27;s past. The final straw came in April when he rehashed familiar comments about the gas chambers and said France should get along with Russia to save the &#x27;white world&#x27;. Ms. Le Pen then openly split with her father, saying he was committing &#x27;political suicide&#x27;. But he vowed to &#x27;reconquer&#x27; the party he founded in 1972.

A French court decided in June 2015 to cancel his suspension; although the members of the party were to hold a vote to accept or reject a whole series of measures aiming at changing the National Front&#x27;s status, including Le Pen&#x27;s honorary presidency. On 10 July another French court ruled to suspend the vote two days beforehand and urged the party to organize an in-person Congress, as Le Pen sued the National Front again. The party decided to appeal against both of these decisions. The FN then decided, on 29 July, to count the votes on the suppression of Le Pen&#x27;s Honorary Presidency, which showed that 94% of the members were in favour of this decision. However, due to the legal challenges to the FN&#x27;s removal of Le Pen as its honorary president, he continued to officially hold the position.

In August 2015, Le Pen was expelled from the National Front after a special party congress. He later founded the Comités Jeanne.

===Blue, White and Red Rally===

Blue, White and Red Rally () is a French nationalist political association founded by Le Pen on 5 September 2015 after his August expulsion from the FN. He told supporters in the city: &#x27;You will not be orphans. We can act in a similar way to the FN, even if we are not part of it.&#x27;
He confirmed he would support his granddaughter Marion Maréchal-Le Pen for the next regional elections and that he wanted to influence the National Front&#x27;s ideology with his association. He also praised Marine Le Pen&#x27;s speech in Marseille on 6 September 2015, describing it as &quot;lepéniste&quot;.

===Personal life, wealth, and security===
Le Pen&#x27;s marriage to Pierrette Le Pen from 29 June 1960 to 18 March 1987 produced three daughters, who gave him eight grandchildren. The break-up of the marriage was somewhat dramatic, with his ex-wife posing nude, to ridicule him, in the French edition of &quot;Playboy&quot;. Marie-Caroline, one of his daughters, broke with Le Pen, following her husband to join Bruno Mégret, who split from the FN to found the rival Mouvement National Républicain (MNR, National Republican Movement). The youngest of Le Pen&#x27;s daughters, Marine Le Pen, is leader of the National Rally. On 31 May 1991, Jean-Marie Le Pen married Jeanne-Marie Paschos (&quot;Jany&quot;), of Greek descent, in a civil ceremony. Born in 1933, Paschos was previously married to Belgian businessman Jean Garnier. The two married again in a religious marriage in 2021, in a ceremony presided by traditionalist Catholic priest Philippe Laguérie.

In 1977, Le Pen inherited a fortune from Hubert Lambert (1934–1976), son of the cement industrialist Leon Lambert (1877–1952), one of three sons of Lambert Cement founder Hilaire Lambert. Hubert Lambert was a political supporter of Le Pen and a monarchist as well. Lambert&#x27;s will provided 30 million francs () to Le Pen, as well as his opulent three-storey 11-room mansion at 8 Parc de Montretout, Saint-Cloud, in the western suburbs of Paris. The home had been built by Napoleon III for his chief of staff Jean-François Mocquard. With his wife, he also owned a two-storey townhouse on the Rue Hortense in Rueil-Malmaison and another house in his hometown of La Trinité-sur-Mer in Brittany.

In the early 1980s, Le Pen&#x27;s personal security was assured by KO International Company, a subsidiary of VHP Security, a private security firm, and an alleged front organisation for SAC, the &quot;Service d&#x27;Action Civique&quot; (Civic Action Service), a Gaullist organisation. SAC allegedly employed figures with organized crime backgrounds and from the far-right movement.

In April 2024, Jean-Marie Le Pen was placed &quot;under legal protection&quot; at the request of his family.

===Illness and death===

Le Pen was briefly hospitalized after a minor stroke on 2 February 2022. He was hospitalized again on 15 April 2023, after suffering a &quot;mild heart attack&quot;, and was discharged from the hospital on 3 May. 

In April 2024, Le Pen experienced another heart attack. In November 2024, he was hospitalized for two weeks for medical examinations related to old age, and his family expressed concerns about his general state of health.

Le Pen died at a care facility in Garches, Hauts-de-Seine, on 7 January 2025, at the age of 96. He had been in failing health due to complications from the heart attack he suffered in 2024.

His daughter Marine, who succeeded him at the helm of the National Front, learned about his death from journalists on a stopover in Nairobi, Kenya, while travelling from Mayotte to Paris. The announcement of her father&#x27;s death had first been made to Agence France-Presse (AFP) by the Le Pen family.

Le Pen was buried in a private ceremony following a mass in his hometown, La Trinité-sur-Mer, on 11 January. A public memorial ceremony was held at the Notre-Dame du Val-de-Grâce church in Paris on 16 January.

President Emmanuel Macron said that history would decide the legacy of Le Pen, while prime minister François Bayrou said &quot;We knew, by fighting him, what a fighter he was&quot;. Left-winger Jean-Luc Mélenchon said that respect for the dead and the bereaved could not excuse &quot;the hatred, racism, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism that he spread&quot;. In Belgium, Vlaams Belang leader Tom Van Grieken praised a &quot;founding father&quot; of European nationalism.

Crowds estimated in the hundreds, in several French cities, celebrated in the street to mark the death of Le Pen. These parties were condemned by French government ministers including Bruno Retailleau and Sébastien Lecornu.

==Issues and policy positions==
===Death penalty===
Le Pen supported bringing back the death penalty in France.

===Controversial statements===
Le Pen was accused and convicted several times in France and abroad of xenophobia and antisemitism. A Paris court found in February 2005 that his verbal criticisms, such as remarks disparaging Muslims in a 2003 &quot;Le Monde&quot; interview, were &quot;inciting racial hatred&quot;, and he was fined €10,000 and ordered to pay an additional €5,000 in damages to the &quot;Ligue des droits de l&#x27;homme&quot; (League for Human Rights). The conviction and fines were upheld by the Court of Cassation in 2006.

* In May 1987, he advocated the forced isolation from society of all people infected with HIV, by placing them in a special &quot;sidatorium&quot;. &quot;Sidaïque&quot; is Le Pen&#x27;s pejorative solecism for &quot;person infected with AIDS&quot; (the more usual French term is &quot;séropositif&quot; (seropositive)) The term &quot;sidatorium&quot; was coined by François Bachelot.
* On 21 June 1995, he attacked singer Patrick Bruel, who is of Algerian Jewish descent, on his policy of no longer singing in the city of Toulon because the city had just elected a mayor from the National Front. Le Pen said, &quot;the city of Toulon will then have to get along without the vocalisations of singer Benguigui&quot;. Benguigui, an Algerian name, is Bruel&#x27;s birth name.
* In August 1996, he declared &quot;believing in the inequality of races&quot; saying &quot;they don&#x27;t have the same capacities or same level of historic evolution&quot;
* In February 1997, Le Pen accused Chirac of being &quot;on the payroll of Jewish organizations, and particularly of the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith&quot;
* Le Pen once made the infamous pun &quot;Durafour-crématoire&quot; (&quot;four crématoire&quot; meaning &quot;crematory oven&quot;) about then-minister Michel Durafour, who had said in public a few days before, &quot;One must &quot;exterminate&quot; the National Front&quot;.
* On many occasions, before and after the FIFA World Cup, he claimed that the French World Cup squad contained too many non-white players, and was not an accurate reflection of French society. He went on to scold players for not singing &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, saying they were not &quot;French&quot;.
* In the 2007 election campaign, he referred to fellow candidate Nicolas Sarkozy, who is of partial Greek Jewish and Hungarian descent, as &quot;foreign&quot; or &quot;the foreigner&quot;.
* In a 2014 video on the National Front&#x27;s website, Le Pen reacted to criticism of him by Jewish singer Patrick Bruel with &quot;next time we&#x27;ll do a whole oven batch!&quot; Le Pen later claimed the comments he made had no anti-Semitic connotations &quot;except for my political enemies or imbeciles&quot;.

Arguing that his party includes people of various ethnic or religious origins like Jean-Pierre Cohen, Farid Smahi or Huguette Fatna, he attributed some anti-Semitism in France to the effects of Muslim immigration to Europe, and suggested that some part of the Jewish community in France might eventually come to appreciate National Front ideology. Le Pen denied man-made climate change and linked climate science with communism.

He also infamously compared gay people to soup with salt, saying &quot;it&#x27;s like salt with soup: if there is not enough, it&#x27;s too bland, and if it&#x27;s too much, it&#x27;s undrinkable&quot;, and compared pedophilia with &quot;the exaltation of homosexuality&quot;.

===Prosecution concerning Holocaust denial===
Le Pen made several provocative statements concerning the Holocaust, which were legally ruled to be Holocaust denial. He was convicted of racism or inciting racial hatred at least six times. For example, on 13 September 1987, he said, &quot;I ask myself several questions. I&#x27;m not saying the gas chambers didn&#x27;t exist. I haven&#x27;t seen them myself. I haven&#x27;t particularly studied the question. But I believe it&#x27;s just a detail in the history of World War II.&quot; For Le Pen, the French deportation of 76,000 Jews from France to Nazi concentration camps, where they were killed, is a trivial matter, and he denies that 6 million Jews were killed, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t think there were that many deaths. There weren&#x27;t 6 million ... There weren&#x27;t mass murders as it&#x27;s been said.&quot; He was eventually condemned under the Gayssot Act to pay 1.2 million francs (€183,200).

In 1997, the European Parliament, of which Le Pen was then a member, removed his parliamentary immunity so that Le Pen could be tried by a German court for comments he made at a December 1996 press conference before the German Republikaner party. Echoing his 1987 remarks in France, Le Pen stated: &quot;If you take a 1,000-page book on World War II, the concentration camps take up only two pages and the gas chambers 10 to 15 lines. This is what one calls a detail.&quot; In June 1999, a Munich court found this statement to be &quot;minimizing the Holocaust, which caused the deaths of six million Jews,&quot; and convicted and fined Le Pen for his remarks. Le Pen retorted sarcastically: &quot;I understand now that it&#x27;s the Second World War which is a detail of the history of the gas chambers.&quot;

===Other legal problems and allegations===

*Prosecution for assault: In April 2000, Le Pen was suspended from the European Parliament following prosecution for the physical assault of Socialist candidate Annette Peulvast-Bergeal during the 1997 general election. This ultimately led to him losing his seat in the parliament in 2003. The Versailles appeals court banned him from seeking office for one year.
*Statements about Muslims in France: In 2005 and 2008, Le Pen was fined, in both cases €10,000 for &quot;incitement to discrimination, hatred and violence towards a group of people&quot;, on account of statements made about Muslims in France. In 2010. The European Court of Human Rights declared Le Pen&#x27;s application inadmissible.
*Allegations of war crimes in Algeria: Le Pen allegedly practiced torture during the Algerian War, when he was an Army lieutenant. He denied it and won some trials. But he lost a trial when he attacked &quot;Le Monde&quot; newspaper on charges of defamation, following accusations by the newspaper that he had used torture. &quot;Le Monde&quot; produced in May 2003 the dagger he allegedly used to commit war crimes as court evidence. Although war crimes committed during the Algerian War are amnestied in France, this was publicised by the newspapers &quot;Le Canard Enchaîné&quot;, &quot;Libération&quot;, and &quot;Le Monde&quot;, and by former prime minister Michel Rocard on TV (TF1 1993). Le Pen sued the papers and Rocard. This affair ended in 2000 when the Cour de cassation (French supreme jurisdiction) concluded that it was legitimate to publish these assertions. In 1995, Le Pen unsuccessfully sued Jean Dufour, regional councillor of the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur (French Communist Party) for the same reason.
*Allegations of misusing EU funds: In December 2023, Le Pen was among 28 people, including his daughter Marine, charged with misusing EU funds meant for European Parliament assistants by instead using them to pay National Rally officials.

==Public image==

===Public perception===
Le Pen was often nicknamed the &quot;Menhir&quot;, due to his &quot;granitic nature&quot; as he was perceived as someone who did not give way to pressure or who could not be easily knocked down. It also connected him to France&#x27;s Celtic origins. Le Pen was often described as one of the most flamboyant and charismatic orators in Europe, whose speech blended folksy humour, crude attacks and rhetorical finesse.

Le Pen was a polarizing figure in France: opinions regarding him tend to be quite strong. A 2002 Ipsos poll showed that while 22% of the electorate had a good or very good opinion of Le Pen, and 13% an unfavorable opinion, 61% had a very unfavorable opinion. Critics called him &quot;The Devil of the Republic&quot;.

Le Pen and the National Front were described by much of the media and nearly all commentators as extreme far right. Le Pen himself and the rest of his party disagreed with this label; earlier in his political career, Le Pen described his position as &quot;neither right, nor left, but French&quot; (&quot;ni droite, ni gauche, français&quot;). He later described his position as right-wing and opposed to the &quot;socialo-communists&quot; and other right-wing parties, which he deemed are not real right-wing parties. At other times, for example during the 2002 election campaign, he declared himself &quot;socially left-wing, economically right-wing, nationally French&quot; (&quot;socialement à gauche, économiquement à droite, nationalement français&quot;). He further contended that most of the French political and media class are corrupt and out of touch with the real needs of the common people, and that they conspired to exclude Le Pen and his party from mainstream politics. Le Pen criticized the other political parties as the &quot;establishment&quot; and lumped all major parties (Communist, Socialist, Union for French Democracy (UDF) and Rally for the Republic (RPR)) into the &quot;Gang of Four&quot; (&quot;la bande des quatre&quot; – an allusion to the Gang of Four during China&#x27;s Cultural Revolution).

===Relations with other groups===
Some of Le Pen&#x27;s statements led other far-right groups, such as the Austrian Freedom Party, and some National Front supporters, to distance themselves from him. Controversial Dutch anti-Islam lawmaker Geert Wilders, who has often been accused of being far-right, also criticized Le Pen, stating &quot;we&#x27;ll never join up with the fascists and Mussolinis of Italy&quot;. Bruno Mégret left the National Front to found his own party (the National Republican Movement, MNR), claiming that Le Pen kept the Front away from the possibility of gaining power. Mégret wanted to emulate Gianfranco Fini&#x27;s success in Italy by making it possible for right-wing parties to ally themselves with the Front, but claimed that Le Pen&#x27;s attitude and outrageous speech prevented this. 

Le Pen&#x27;s daughter Marine leads an internal movement of the Front that wants to &quot;normalize&quot; the National Front, &quot;de-enclave&quot; it, have a &quot;culture of government&quot; etc.; however, relations with Le Pen and other supporters of the hard line are complex. Le Pen&#x27;s National Front electoral successes along with the party gaining wider public prominence led to suggestions for the renewal of the pan-European alliance of extreme-right parties with Le Pen as its figurehead, a suggestion that eventually did indeed bring about the establishment of the Europe of Nations and Freedom group in the European Parliament, chaired by Le Pen&#x27;s daughter Marine.

On 22 March 2018, Le Pen joined the Alliance for Peace and Freedom. In October 2021, he endorsed Éric Zemmour for the 2022 French presidential election over his daughter Marine.

<text>Manfred Winkelhock (6 October 1951 – 12 August 1985) was a German racing driver, who competed in Formula One between and . 

Born and raised in Waiblingen, Winkelhock was the older brother of Joachim and Thomas. Winkelhock participated in 56 Formula One Grands Prix for Arrows, ATS, Brabham and RAM, with a best finish of fifth at the 1982 Brazilian Grand Prix. 

During the 1985 1000 km of Mosport, Winkelhock died following a single-vehicle collision with a concrete barrier, driving the Porsche 962C for Kremer. His son Markus went on to also compete in Formula One at the 2007 European Grand Prix for Spyker, and won the FIA GT1 World Championship in 2012 with Münnich.

==Racing career==
Born in Waiblingen on 6 October 1951, Manfred Winkelhock was the older brother of Joachim and Thomas. He began racing in Formula Two in 1978 and survived a major crash at Nürburgring Nordschleife circuit. The front wing of his March 802, still made of metal at that time, got bent early in the race, suffering some loss of downforce. Despite driving carefully, in the fourth lap, when going over the very steep rise of Quiddelbacher Höhe before Flugplatz corner, the car suddenly lifted its nose, went airborne, somersaulted backwards and then sideways.

Winkelhock along with Hervé Poulain and Marcel Mignot drove a BMW M1 Group 4 racing version that was painted by pop artist Andy Warhol for the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans. They came in 6th overall and 2nd in their class.

Winkelhock&#x27;s first attempt at qualifying for a Formula One Grand Prix race was in Italy, when he stood in for the injured Jochen Mass at Arrows. He was able to land a drive with ATS in . As BMW became the team&#x27;s engine supplier in , he qualified well on several occasions in 1983 and , but the car was rarely reliable, so there were few results and a lot of accidents.

His son, Markus Winkelhock, is also a racing driver. He participated in only one F1 race, the European GP at the Nürburgring in 2007, and led for six laps due to rain.

==Death==
At the same time he was a regular sports car and touring car driver, winning the 1000km Monza with Marc Surer in 1985. He was killed in the summer of 1985 when he crashed heavily at the fearsome Turn 2 at Mosport Park of Bowmanville near Toronto, Ontario, Canada, during the Budweiser 1000 km World Endurance Championship event, driving a Porsche 962C for Kremer Racing with co-driver Marc Surer. The crash was Sunday, 11 August and he succumbed to injuries the next day while at the Sunnybrook Medical Center in Toronto. 

At the time of Winkelhock&#x27;s death, he was a driver for the Skoal Bandit sponsored RAM Racing team in Formula One, though it had been a frustrating season with a best finish of 12th in the 1985 French Grand Prix at Paul Ricard. His death saw him replaced by Northern Irish driver Kenny Acheson, though lack of money saw the team fold before the end of the season.

<text>Diego de Nicuesa (; died 1511) was a Spanish conquistador and explorer.

==Background==
Diego arrived Santo Domingo in April 1502, with Nicolás de Ovando y Cáceres&#x27; flotilla.

In 1506, Nicuesa was given the job of governing Costa Rica, but ran aground off the coast of Panama. He made his way north overland, against resistance from the native population. The combination of guerrilla warfare and tropical disease killed half his expedition before he gave up.

In 1508, Diego de Nicuesa received a land grant at Veragua from Ferdinand II of Aragon, the Spanish monarch. He became founder and governor of Castilla de Oro, in what is now Panama, one of the first two Spanish settlements on the American mainland.

==Final events and disappearance==
In 1510 he founded the colony of Nombre de Dios. The colony suffered from hunger, hostile natives, and illness, and was ultimately saved by the arrival of Colmenares, a companion who was coming after with supplies. The party abandoned the colony to sail to the more prosperous colony of Santa María la Antigua del Darién, which had been established by the conquistador Vasco Núñez de Balboa without the knowledge of Nicuesa. Informed by Colmenares of the new colony established within the borders of his territory, he headed to the colony to punish the colonists and take possession of it. But the colonists of Santa Maria were warned of the governor&#x27;s intent and denied him entry. While most of Nicuesa&#x27;s men were granted the right to stay in Balboa&#x27;s colony, Nicuesa and 17 loyal followers were put out to sea. Nicuesa headed for the &quot;Santo Domingo&quot;, but the ship disappeared and he was never seen again.

<text>Bartholomaeus Schwartz (latinised to Bartholomaeus Nigrinus) (159512 October 1646) was a German protestant theologian, pastor of the St. Peter and St. Paul&#x27;s Church in Danzig (Gdańsk), Royal Prussia (now Poland).

== Biography ==
Bartholomaeus Schwartz was born in 1595 in Bąków, of Socinian parents. He might be related to Wilhelm Nigrinus (1588-1638), a German philosopher.

Having converted to Lutheranism, he later became a Calvinist minister at Gdańsk. The famous poet Martin Opitz, a friend, lodged at pastor Nigrinus&#x27; place, while visiting Gdańsk. Both Opitz and Nigrinus corresponded with Robert Fludd. Fludd was connected to the Rosicrucian movement and the Gdańsk edition of the Rosicrucian manifesto &quot;Fama Fraternitatis&quot; was published by the printer Andreas Hünefeld (&quot;Huenefeldt&quot; or &quot;Hunsfeldus&quot;) (1609-1652), a friend of Nigrinus. Nigrinus was also a friend and disciple of the Czech philosopher John Amos Comenius, who has often been linked to the Rosicrucian movement.

After the death of Opitz, Nigrinus and two of his associates edited his poems (Gdańsk: Hünefeld, 1639).

Later in his life, Nigrinus converted to Catholicism. His conversion was not publicized until 1642. After his conversion, he was appointed confidential secretary to Władysław IV.

Nigrinus maintained, before the king and several bishops, that it would be possible to unite all Christian churches by means of a friendly discussion between some chosen doctors of the different confessions. The king adopted the advice of Nigrinus, and resolved to call to a friendly meeting (&quot;Colloquium Charitativum&quot;), a number of divines of all the Christian confessions. He communicated his idea to the primate Maciej Łubieński and Pope Innocent X, and ordered, as a preparatory step for the intended meeting, the convocation of a Roman Catholic synod, which was held at Warsaw towards the end of the year 1643. The meeting was finally called to convene at Toruń, on October 10, 1644. The date was later extended to August 28, 1645; but when it convened it was soon made evident that a union of Protestants and Catholics was out of the question, the latter refusing to give up communion under one kind, the former to accept papal supremacy; and after several protests had been made on both sides, the inutility of continuing the discussions became evident, and the &quot;colloquium&quot; was closed on November 21 with much less solemnity than it had been opened. Instead of producing, as had been hoped, a reconciliation of the adverse confessions, or even an approximation to it, the &quot;colloquium&quot; rather increased their mutual acrimony; and each party published pamphlets, charging its opponents with the ill success of the congress. After this we hear no more of Nigrinus.

<doc id="49966" wikidata="Q185107" url="?curid=49966" title="Carlos Menem">
<text>Carlos Saúl Menem (2 July 1930 – 14 February 2021) served as the 50th president of Argentina from 1989 to 1999. Ideologically, he identified as a Peronist and supported economically liberal policies. He led Argentina as president during the 1990s and implemented a free market liberalization. He served as President of the Justicialist Party for 13 years (from 1990 to 2001 and again from 2001 to 2003), and his political approach became known as Menemism.

Born in Anillaco, La Rioja, to a Syrian family, Menem was raised as a Muslim, but later converted to Roman Catholicism to pursue a political career. Menem became a Peronist during a visit to Buenos Aires. He was elected governor of La Rioja in 1973, deposed and detained following the 1976 Argentine coup d&#x27;état, and re-elected in 1983. He defeated the Buenos Aires governor Antonio Cafiero in the primary elections for the 1989 presidential elections. Hyperinflation and riots forced outgoing president Raúl Alfonsín to resign early, shortening the presidential transition.

Menem&#x27;s presidency supported the Washington Consensus and tackled inflation with the Convertibility plan in 1991. The plan was complemented by a series of privatizations and was initially a success. Argentina re-established diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom, suspended since the 1982 Falklands War, and aligned itself with the United States. Under his administration, the country participated in the 1991 Gulf War and suffered two terrorist attacks: an attack on the Israeli embassy in 1992 and the 1994 AMIA bombing. The Peronist victory in the 1993 midterm elections allowed him to persuade Alfonsín, by then leader of the opposition party Radical Civic Union, to sign the Pact of Olivos for the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. This amendment allowed Menem to run for re-election in 1995, winning a second, four-year term. A new economic crisis began, and the opposing parties formed a political coalition, winning the 1997 midterm elections and the 1999 presidential election.

Menem was investigated on various criminal and corruption charges, including illegal arms trafficking (he was sentenced to seven years in prison), embezzlement of public funds (he was sentenced to years to prison), extortion and bribery (he was declared innocent of both charges). His position as senator earned him immunity from incarceration.

Menem ran for the presidency again in 2003, but faced with a likely defeat in a ballotage against Néstor Kirchner, he chose to pull out, effectively handing the presidency to Kirchner. He was elected senator for La Rioja in 2005. By the time he died in 2021 at age 90, he was the oldest living former Argentine president. He is regarded as a polarizing figure in Argentina, mostly due to corruption and economic mismanagement throughout his presidency.

==Early life and education==

Carlos Saúl Menem was born on 2 July 1930 in Anillaco, a small town in the mountainous north of La Rioja Province, Argentina. His parents, Saúl Menem and Mohibe Akil, were Syrian nationals from Yabroud who had emigrated to Argentina. He attended elementary and high school in La Rioja, and joined a basketball team during his university studies. He visited Buenos Aires in 1951 with the team, and met the president Juan Perón and his wife Eva Perón. This influenced Menem to become a Peronist. He studied law at the National University of Córdoba, graduating in 1955.

After President Juan Perón&#x27;s overthrow in 1955, Menem was briefly incarcerated. He later joined the successor to the Peronist Party, the Justicialist Party &quot;(Partido Justicialista)&quot; (PJ). He was elected president of its La Rioja Province chapter in 1973. In that capacity, he was included in the flight to Spain that brought Perón back to Argentina after his long exile. According to the Peronist politician Juan Manuel Abal Medina, Menem played no special part in the event.

== Governor of La Rioja ==

=== 1st term (1973–1976) and arrest===

Menem was elected governor of La Rioja in 1973 when the proscription of Peronism was lifted. He was deposed during the 1976 Argentine coup d&#x27;état that overthrew President Isabel Perón. He was accused of corruption and having links with the guerrillas of the Dirty War. He was detained on 25 March, kept for a week at a local barracks, and then moved to a temporary prison on the ship &quot;33 Orientales&quot; in Buenos Aires. He was detained alongside former ministers Antonio Cafiero, Jorge Taiana, Miguel Unamuno, José Deheza, and Pedro Arrighi, the unionists Jorge Triaca, Diego Ibáñez, and Lorenzo Miguel, the diplomat Jorge Vázquez, the journalist Osvaldo Papaleo, and the former president Raúl Lastiri. He shared a cell with Pedro Eladio Vázquez, Juan Perón&#x27;s personal physician. During this time he helped the chaplain Lorenzo Lavalle, despite still being a Muslim. In July he was sent to Magdalena, to a permanent prison. His wife Zulema visited him every week, but rejected his conversion to Roman Catholicism. His mother died during the time he was a prisoner, and dictator Jorge Rafael Videla denied his request to attend her funeral. He was released on 29 July 1978, on the condition that he live in a city outside his home province without leaving it. He settled in Mar del Plata.
Menem met Admiral Eduardo Massera, who intended to run for president, and had public meetings with personalities such as Carlos Monzón, Susana Giménez, and Alberto Olmedo. As a result, he was forced to reside in another city, Tandil. He had to report daily to Chief of Police Hugo Zamora. This forced residence was lifted in February 1980. He returned to Buenos Aires, and then to La Rioja. He resumed his political activities, despite the prohibition, and was detained again. His new forced residence was in Las Lomitas in the province of Formosa. He was one of the last politicians to be released from prison by the National Reorganization Process.

=== 2nd and 3rd terms (1983–1989) ===

Military rule ended in 1983, and the Radical Raúl Alfonsín was elected president. Menem ran for governor again and was elected by a clear margin. The province benefited from tax regulations established by the military, which allowed increased industrial growth. His party gained control of the provincial legislature, and he was re-elected in 1987 with 63% of the vote. The Partido Justicialista at the time was divided into two factions, the conservatives that still supported the political doctrines of Juan and Isabel Perón, and those who proposed a renovation of the party. The internal disputes ceased in 1987. Menem, with his prominent victory in his district, was one of the leading figures of the party and disputed its leadership.

==Presidential elections==

Antonio Cafiero, who had been elected governor of Buenos Aires Province, led the renewal of the Partido Justicialista, and was considered their most likely candidate for the presidency. Menem, on the other hand, was seen as a populist leader. Using a big tent approach, he got support from several unrelated political figures. As a result, he defeated Cafiero in the primary elections. He sought alliances with Bunge and Born, union leaders, former members of Montoneros, and the AAA, people from the church, &quot;Carapintadas&quot;, etc. He promised a &quot;revolution of production&quot; and huge wage increases, but it was not clear exactly which policies he was proposing. The rival candidate, Eduardo Angeloz, tried to point out the mistakes made by Menem and Alfonsín. Jacques de Mahieu, a French ideologue of the Peronist movement (and former Vichy collaborator), was photographed campaigning for Menem. His campaign slogans were &quot;¡Siganme!&quot; (Follow me!) and &quot;¡No los voy a defraudar!&quot; (I won&#x27;t let you down!)

The elections were held on 14 May 1989. Menem won by a wide margin, and became the president-elect of Argentina. He was scheduled to take office on 10 December, but inflation levels took a turn for the worse, growing into hyperinflation, causing public riots. The outgoing president Alfonsín resigned and transferred power to Menem five months early, on 8 July. Menem&#x27;s accession marked the first time since Hipólito Yrigoyen took office in 1916 that an incumbent president peacefully transferred power to an elected successor from the opposition.

==Presidency==


===Economic policy===
Hyperinflation forced Menem to abandon party orthodoxy in favour of a fiscally conservative, market-oriented economic policy.
At the time, most economists thought that the ideal solution was the Washington Consensus; i.e. reduce expenditures below the amount of money earned by the state, and open international commerce to free trade. Alfonsín had proposed similar reforms in the past, alongside some limited privatization of state-owned enterprises; those projects were resisted by the Partido Justicialistal opposition party, whose internal factions were actually benefiting from the prevailing protectionist policies. The magnitude of the crisis, however, convinced most politicians to change their minds. Menem, fearing that the crisis might force him to resign as well, embraced the Washington Consensus and rejected the traditional policies of Peronism.

The president invited several conservative figures into his cabinet, such as Álvaro Alsogaray, as well as a businessman from Bunge and Born; Miguel Roig, the company&#x27;s then-vice president, became Menem&#x27;s first appointed minister of economy on 30 May, although he would be replaced just five days after taking office due to his sudden death by myocardial infarction; in his place was appointed Néstor Mario Rapanelli, who had succeeded Roig as vice president at Bunge and Born.

Congress passed the economic emergency and state reform laws. The first allowed president Menem to reduce or remove subsidies at his discretion, and the latter to privatize state enterprises – the first being telephones and airlines. These privatizations were beneficial to foreign creditors, who replaced their bonds with company shares. Despite increased tax revenue and the money gained from privatizations, the economy was still unstable. The Bunge and Born businessmen left the government in late 1989, amid a second round of hyperinflation.

The first measure of the new minister of economy, Antonio Erman González, was a mandatory conversion of time deposits into government bonds: the BONEX plan. It exacerbated the recession but was successful in reducing the inflation rate, which was its intended purpose. His fourth minister of economy, Domingo Cavallo, was appointed in 1991 and deepened the liberalization of the economy. The Convertibility plan was sanctioned by Congress, setting a one-to-one fixed exchange rate between the United States dollar and the new peso, which replaced the austral. The law also limited public expenditures, but this was frequently ignored. Under Cavallo, there was increased free trade, alongside a general reduction of tariffs on imports and state regulations to tackle inflation, and high taxes on sales and earnings to reduce the deficit caused by it. Initially, the plan was a success: the capital flight ended, interest rates were lowered, inflation fell to single digits, and economic activity increased; in that year alone, the gross domestic product grew at a rate of 10.5%.

The money from privatizations allowed Argentina to repurchase many of the Brady Bonds issued during the crisis. The privatizations of electricity, water, and gas services were more successful than previous ones. YPF, the national oil refinery, was partially privatized as well, with the state keeping a good portion of its shares. The project to privatize the pension funds was resisted in Congress and was approved as a mixed system that allowed both public and private options for workers. The national state also signed a fiscal pact with the provinces, so that they reduced their local deficits as well; Buenos Aires Province was aided with a fund that gave the governor a million pesos daily.

Although the Convertibility plan had positive consequences in the short term, it caused problems that surfaced later. Large numbers of employees of privatized state enterprises were fired, and unemployment grew to over 10%. Big compensation payments prevented an immediate public reaction. Free trade and the expensive costs in dollars forced private companies to reduce the number of workers as well, or risk bankruptcy. Unions were unable to resist the changes. People with low incomes, such as retirees and state workers, suffered under tax increases while their wages remained frozen. Some provinces, such as Santiago del Estero, Jujuy, and San Juan, endured violent riots as well. To compensate for these issues, the government started a number of social welfare programs and restored protectionist policies over some sectors of the economy. It was difficult for Argentine companies to export, and easy imports damaged most national producers. The national budget soon slid into a deficit.

Cavallo soon began the second wave of privatizations, this time targeting the national postal service, the Correo Argentino, and the country&#x27;s nuclear power plants. He also limited the amount of money released to the provinces. He still had the full support of Menem, despite growing opposition within the Justicialist Party.

The Mexican Tequila Crisis of 1994 impacted the national economy, causing the deficit, recession, and a growth in unemployment. The government further reduced public expenditures, the wages of state workers, and raised taxes. The deficit and recession were reduced, but unemployment stayed high. External debt increased. The crisis also proved that the economic system was vulnerable to capital flight.

The growing discontent over unemployment and the scandals caused by the privatization of the postal service led to Cavallo&#x27;s removal as a minister, and his replacement by Roque Fernández. Fernández maintained Cavallo&#x27;s fiscal austerity; he increased the price of fuels, sold the remaining state shares of YPF to Repsol, fired state employees, and raised the value-added tax to 21%. New labor law was met with resistance, both by Peronists, opposition parties, and unions, and could not be approved by Congress.

The 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 1998 Russian financial crisis also affected the country with consequences that lasted longer than the Tequila Crisis and started a depression.

===Domestic policy===

Menem began his presidency assuming a non-confrontational approach, appointing people from the conservative opposition and business people to his cabinet. To prevent successful legal cases against pro-market economic reforms, the Supreme Court&#x27;s numbers were increased from five to nine judges; the new judges ruled in support of Menem and usually had the majority. Other institutions that restrained or limited executive power were controlled as well. When Congress resisted some of his proposals, he used the Necessity and Urgency Decree as an alternative to sending bills to it. He even considered it feasible to dissolve Congress and rule by decree, but this step was never implemented. In addition, he developed a &quot;bon vivant&quot; lifestyle, taking advantage of his authority. For instance, he made a journey from Buenos Aires to Pinamar driving a Ferrari 348 TB (often misreported as a Ferrari Testarossa) in less than two hours, violating speed limits. He divorced his wife Zulema Yoma and expanded the Quinta de Olivos presidential residence with a golf course, a small zoo, servants, a barber, and even a buffoon.

The swiftgate scandal broke out in December 1990, as American investors were damaged by a case of corruption, and asked for assistance from the United States&#x27; Ambassador Terence Todman. Most of the ministers resigned as a result of it. Cavallo was reassigned as minister of economy, and his successful economic plan turned him into a prominent figure in Menem&#x27;s cabinet. Cavallo brought a number of independent economists to the cabinet, and Menem supported him by replacing Peronist politicians. Both teams complemented each other. Both Menem and Cavallo tried to be recognized as the designer of the convertibility plan.

Antonio Cafiero, a rival of Menem in the Partido Justicialistal, was unable to amend the constitution of the province of Buenos Aires to run for re-election. Duhalde stepped down from the vice presidency and became the new governor in the 1991 elections, turning the province into a powerful bastion. Menem also selected famous people with no political background to run for office in those elections, including the singer Palito Ortega and racing driver Carlos Reutemann. The elections were a big success for the Partido Justicialistal. After these elections, all of the Partido Justicialistal, was aligned with Menem&#x27;s leadership, with the exception of a small number of legislators known as the &quot;Group of Eight&quot;. The opposition from the UCR was minimal, as the party was still discredited by the 1989 crisis. With such political influence, Menem began his proposal to amend the constitution to allow a re-election. The party did not have the required supermajority in the Congress to call for it. The Partido Justicialistal was divided, as other politicians intended to replace Menem in 1995 or negotiate their support. The UCR was divided as well, as Alfonsín opposed the proposal, but governors Angeloz and Massaccesi were open for negotiations. The victory in the 1993 elections strengthened his proposal, which was approved by the Senate. Menem called for a non-binding referendum on the proposal, to increase pressure on the Radical deputies. He also sent a bill to Congress to modify the majority requirements. Alfonsín met with Menem and agreed to support the proposal in exchange for amendments that would place limits on presidential power. This negotiation is known as the Pact of Olivos. The capital city of Buenos Aires would be allowed to elect its own chief of government. Presidential elections would use a system of ballotage, and the president could only be re-elected once. The electoral college was abolished, replaced by direct elections. The provinces would be allowed to elect a third senator; two for the majority party and one for the first minority. The Council of Magistracy of the Nation would have the power to propose new judges, and the Necessity and Urgency Decrees would have a reduced scope.

Despite the internal opposition of Fernando de la Rúa, Alfonsín got his party to approve the pact. He reasoned that Menem would be supported by the eventual referendum, that many legislators would turn to his side, and he would eventually be able to amend the constitution reinforcing presidential power rather than limiting it. Still, as both sides feared a betrayal, all the contents of the pact were included as a single proposal, not allowing the Constituent Assembly to discuss each one separately. The Broad Front, a new political party composed of former Peronists, led by Carlos Álvarez, grew in the elections for the Constituent Assembly. Both the Partido Justicialista and the UCR respected the pact, which was completely approved. Duhalde made a similar amendment to the constitution of Buenos Aires province, in order to be re-elected in 1995. Menem won the elections with more than 50% of the vote, followed by José Octavio Bordón and Carlos Álvarez. The UCR finished third in the elections for the first time.

Growing unemployment increased popular resistance against Menem after his re-election. There were several riots and demonstrations in the provinces, unions opposed the economic policies, and the opposing parties organized the first &quot;cacerolazos&quot;. Estanislao Esteban Karlic replaced Antonio Quarracino as the head of the Argentine Episcopal Conference, which led to a growing opposition to Menem from the Church. The teachers&#x27; unions established a &quot;white tent&quot; at the Congressional plaza as a form of protest. The first &quot;piqueteros&quot; operated in Cutral Có, and this protest method was soon imitated in the rest of the country. Menem&#x27;s authority in the Partido Justicialista was also held in doubt, as he was unable to run for another re-election and the party sought a candidate for the 1999 elections. This led to a fierce rivalry with Duhalde, the most likely candidate. Menem attempted to undermine his chances, and proposed a new amendment to the constitution allowing him to run for an unlimited number of re-elections. He also started a judicial case, claiming that his inability to run for a third term was a proscription. Several scandals erupted, such as the scandal over Argentine arms sales to Ecuador and Croatia, the Río Tercero explosion that may have destroyed evidence, the murder of the journalist José Luis Cabezas, and the suicide of Alfredo Yabrán, who may have ordered it. The Partido Justicialista lost the 1997 midterm elections against the UCR and the FREPASO united in a political coalition, the Alliance for Work, Justice and Education (Alianza). The Supreme Court confirmed that Menem was unable to run for a third re-election. Duhalde became the candidate for the presidential elections, and lost to the candidate for the Alianza ticket, Fernando de la Rúa.

===Foreign policy===

During Menem&#x27;s presidency, Argentina aligned with the United States, and had special relations with the country. Menem had good relations with U.S. president George H. W. Bush, and his successor Bill Clinton from 1993 on.

The country left the Non-Aligned Movement, and the Cóndor missile program was discontinued. Argentina supported all the international positions of the U.S., and sent forces to the Gulf War, and the peace keeping efforts during the War in Bosnia and after the Kosovo War.

The country was accepted as a major non-NATO ally, but not as a full member.

Menem&#x27;s government re-established relations with the United Kingdom, suspended since the Falklands War, after Margaret Thatcher left office in 1990. The discussions on the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute were temporarily given a lower priority, and the focus shifted to discussions of fishing rights.

In 1991, Menem became the first head of state of Argentina to make a diplomatic visit to Israel. He proposed mediating between Israel and Syria in their negotiations over the Golan Heights. The diplomatic relations between Argentina and Israel were later damaged by the lack of results in the investigations over the terrorist attacks against the Israeli embassy and the AMIA center in Buenos Aires.

In 1998, Menem visited Russia, and met with Russian president Boris Yeltsin, where Menem expressed his anticommunist sentiments and congratulated Yeltsin for &quot;defeating communism&quot; in Russia.

====Chile====

Menem also settled all remaining border issues with Chile. The Lago del Desierto dispute had an international arbitration, favourable to Argentina. The only exception was the dispute over the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, which is still open.

Previously and contrary to other Peronist authorities, Menem voted for the Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina. Chilean president Patricio Aylwin was at first sceptical towards his Argentine counterpart whom he according to Emol considered &quot;scruffy&quot; (). Over time however Aylwin changed his opinion, saying at one point &quot;this Turk wins everybody over&quot; (&quot;este turco se los conquista a todos&quot;). Aylwin&#x27;s successor, Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, had particularly warm relations with Menem. Former Chilean foreign minister José Miguel Insulza recalls of meetings with Menem and Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle in Anillaco in the 1990s where they enjoyed talking about politics and football. All of this made the critics of Menem label him &quot;pro-Chilean&quot;. President of Chile Sebastián Piñera posthumously called him &quot;a good friend of Chile&quot;. Similarly, José Miguel Insulza called Menem &quot;one of the best friends of Chile&quot;.

===Armed forces===

Argentina was still divided by the aftermath of the Dirty War (the dirty war ended in 1983, Menem&#x27;s presidency began in 1989). Menem proposed an agenda of national reconciliation. First, he arranged the repatriation of the body of Juan Manuel de Rosas, a controversial 19th century governor, and proposed to reconcile his legacy with those of Bartolomé Mitre and Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, who also fought in the Argentine Civil Wars. Menem intended to use the reconciliation of these historical Argentine figures as a metaphor for the reconciliation of the Dirty War. However, although the repatriation and acceptance of Rosas was a success, the acceptance of the military regime was not.

The military leaders of the National Reorganization Process, convicted in the 1985 Trial of the Juntas, received presidential pardons, despite popular opposition to them. This was an old request of the &quot;Carapintadas&quot; in previous years. However, Menem did not apply their proposed changes to the military. The colonel, Mohamed Alí Seineldín, who was also pardoned, started a new mutiny, killing two military men. Unlike the mutinies that took place during the presidency of Alfonsín, the military fully obeyed Menem&#x27;s orders for a forceful repression. Seineldín was utterly defeated, and sentenced to life imprisonment. This was the last military mutiny in Argentina.

The president effected drastic cuts to the military budget, and privatized military factories. Menem appointed Lt. Gen. Martín Balza, who had performed well during the repression of Seineldín&#x27;s mutiny, as the Army&#x27;s General Chief of Staff (head of the military hierarchy). The death of a conscript soldier in 1994, victim of abuses by his superiors, led to the abolition of conscription in the country. The following year, Balza voiced the first institutional self-criticism of the armed forces during the Dirty War, saying that obedience did not justify the actions committed in those years.

===Terrorist attacks===

The Israeli embassy suffered a terrorist car bomb attack on 17 March 1992. It was perceived as a consequence of Argentina&#x27;s involvement in the Gulf War. Although Hezbollah claimed responsibility for it, the Supreme Court investigated several other hypotheses. The Court wrote a report in 1996 suggesting that it could have been the explosion of an arms cache stored in the basement. Another hypothesis was that the attack could have been performed by Jewish extremists, in order to cast blame on Muslims and thwart the peace negotiations. The Court finally held Hezbollah responsible for the attack in May 1999.

The Argentine Israelite Mutual Association suffered a terrorist attack with another car bomb on 18 July 1994, killing eighty-five people. It was the most destructive terrorist attack in the history of Latin America. The attack was universally condemned and 155,000 people demonstrated at the Congressional plaza, but Menem did not attend. The legal case stayed unresolved during the remainder of Menem&#x27;s presidency. Menem had suggested, in the first press conference, that former &quot;Carapintada&quot; leaders may be responsible for the attack, but this idea was rejected by the minister of defense several hours later. The CIA office in Buenos Aires initially considered it a joint Iranian-Syrian attack, but some days later considered it just an Iranian attack. Menem and Mossad also preferred this line of investigation. As a result of the attack, the Jewish community in Argentina had increased influence over Argentine politics. Years later, the prosecutor Alberto Nisman charged Menem with covering up a local connection to the attack, as the local terrorists may have been distant Syrian relatives of the Menem family. However, Menem was never tried for this suspected cover-up, and on 18 January 2015, Nisman was found dead of a gunshot to his head at his home in Buenos Aires.

On 15 March 1995, Menem&#x27;s son Carlos Menem Jr. died while piloting a Bell 206B-3 helicopter, along with his friend and fellow racing driver Silvio Oltra who was riding as a passenger. The helicopter reportedly struck overhead power lines near Ramallo in the north of the province of Buenos Aires and crashed, killing both men. Later on, remains of Menem Jr. were exhumed amid murder claims by his mother Zulema Yoma. Menem had accused the Lebanese Shia Islamist group, Hezbollah, of killing his son.

==Post-presidency==

Menem ran in 2003 and won the greatest number of votes, 24%, in the first round of the 27 April 2003 presidential election; but votes were split among numerous parties. Under the 1994 amendment, a presidential candidate can win outright by winning 45% of the vote, or 40% if the margin of victory is 10 or more percentage points. This set the stage for Argentina&#x27;s first-ever ballotage between Menem and second-place finisher, and fellow Peronist, Néstor Kirchner, who had received 22%. It was scheduled for 18 May. However, by that time, Menem had become very unpopular. Polls predicted that he faced almost certain defeat by Kirchner in the runoff. Most polls showed Kirchner taking at least 60 percent of the vote, and at least one poll showed Menem losing by as many as 50 points. To avoid a humiliating defeat, Menem withdrew his candidacy on 14 May, effectively handing the presidency to Kirchner.

Ángel Maza, the elected governor of La Rioja, was allied with Menem, and had campaigned for him. However, weak provincial finances forced Maza to switch his support to Kirchner, which weakened Menem&#x27;s influence even further. In June 2004 Menem announced that he had founded a new faction within the Partido Justicialista, called &quot;People&#x27;s Peronism&quot;. He announced his intention to run in the 2007 election. In 2005, the press reported that he was trying to form an alliance with his former minister of economy Cavallo to fight in the parliamentary elections. Menem said that there had been only preliminary conversations and an alliance did not result. In the 23 October 2005 elections, Menem won the minority seat in the Senate representing his province of birth. The two seats allocated to the majority were won by President Kirchner&#x27;s faction, locally led by Ángel Maza.

Menem ran for Governor of La Rioja in August 2007, but was defeated. He finished in third place with about 22% of the vote. This was viewed as a catastrophic defeat, signaling the end of his political dominance in La Rioja. It was the first time in 30 years that Menem had lost an election. Following this defeat in his home province, he withdrew his candidacy for president. At the end of 2009 he announced that he intended to run for the presidency again in the 2011 elections. but ran for a new term as a senator instead. In 2019, he eventually sat in the Frente de Todos&#x27; Senate bench until his death in 2021.

===Corruption charges===

On 7 June 2001, Menem was arrested over a weapons export scandal. The scheme was based on exports to Ecuador and Croatia in 1991 and 1996. He was held under house arrest until November. He appeared before a judge in late August 2002 and denied all charges. Menem and his Chilean second wife Cecilia Bolocco, who had had a child since their marriage in 2001, fled to Chile. Argentine judicial authorities repeatedly requested Menem&#x27;s extradition to face embezzlement charges. This request was rejected by the Chilean Supreme Court as under Chilean law, people cannot be extradited for questioning. On 22 December 2004, after the arrest warrants were cancelled, Menem returned with his family to Argentina. He still faced charges of embezzlement and failing to declare illegal funds in a Swiss bank. He was declared innocent of those charges in 2013.

In August 2008, the BBC reported that Menem was under investigation for his role in the 1995 Río Tercero explosion, which is alleged to have been part of the weapons scandal involving Croatia and Ecuador. Following an Appeals Court ruling that found Menem guilty of aggravated smuggling, he was sentenced to seven years in prison on 13 June 2013, for his role in illegally smuggling weapons to Ecuador and Croatia; his position as senator earned him immunity from incarceration, and his advanced age (82) afforded him the possibility of house arrest. His minister of defence during the weapons sales, Oscar Camilión, was concurrently sentenced to years. Menem was scheduled to attend a trial on the matter in which he was charged with &quot;indirect responsibility&quot;, on 24 February 2021; but died ten days before that.

In December 2008, the German multinational Siemens agreed to pay an $800 million fine to the United States government, and approximately €700 million to the German government, to settle allegations of bribery. The settlement revealed that Menem had received about US$2 million in bribes from Siemens in exchange for awarding the national ID card and passport production contract to Siemens; Menem denied the charges but nonetheless agreed to pay a fine.

On 1 December 2015, Menem was also found guilty of embezzlement, and sentenced to years to prison. Domingo Cavallo, his economy minister, and Raúl Granillo Ocampo, Menem&#x27;s former minister of justice, also received prison sentences of more than three years for participating in the scheme, and were ordered to repay hundreds of thousands of pesos&#x27; worth of illegal bonuses.

== Illness and death ==

On 13 June 2020, Menem was hospitalized due to a severe case of pneumonia and placed in intensive care; he tested negative for COVID-19 and was discharged on 29 June 2020, three days before his 90th birthday. On 15 December 2020, he was hospitalized again at the Los Arcos Sanatorium due to a urinary infection. On 24 December 2020, Menem was induced into coma after a kidney failure.

He died on 14 February 2021 at the Sanatorio Los Arcos in Buenos Aires from complications of urinary tract infection. The national government issued three days of national mourning, and had a public funeral at the Palace of the Argentine National Congress. It was attended by several politicians, including the president Alberto Fernández, and by hundreds of people. He was buried at the San Justo Islamic cemetery the following day, next to his son. His daughter, Zulemita, confirmed that he had died as a Catholic, but he would be buried according to Muslim rites in the Islamic Cemetery to be with his family.

Although former presidents are meant to have a bust at the Hall of Busts of the Casa Rosada eight years after they leave office, by the time of his death Menem never received that honor. Casa Rosada had a bust of Menem donated by artist Fernando Pugliese, but had not yet disclosed this to the public. President Alberto Fernández told Zulemita Menem that the intention was to reveal the bust in a ceremony once Menem recovered from his illness but Menem&#x27;s death disrupted the plans.

==Style and legacy==
In the early days, Menem sported an image similar to the old &quot;caudillos&quot;, such as Facundo Quiroga and Chacho Peñaloza. He groomed his sideburns in a similar style. His presidential inauguration was attended by several gauchos.

Contrary to Peronist tradition, Menem did not prepare huge rallies in the Plaza de Mayo to address the people from the balcony of the Casa Rosada. Instead, he took full advantage of mass media, such as television.

Menem&#x27;s administration was exalted by libertarians Javier Milei and Diego Giacomini in the late 2010s, after being strongly criticized during and by Kirchnerism. Some liberal economists such as José Luis Espert and Alberto Benegas Lynch have also taken a critical approach towards Menem&#x27;s presidency.

President Javier Milei inaugurated the bust of Carlos Menem at the Casa Rosada in May 2024, 35 years after his victory in the 1989 elections. The event was attended by the Menem family (except for his former wife Zulema Yoma), former officers of the Menem administration, and Milei&#x27;s own cabinet. The bust is modeled after Menem&#x27;s 1980s appearance, with high sideburns. Milei praised that, unlike most Argentine politicians Menem had worked in the private sector before getting started in politics, and that he pardoned the military and guerrillas alike even if facing rejection from his own family. The bust is made of carrara marble and, unlike most other busts in the hall, it shows Menem with a prominent smile.

<text>Lviv ( or ; ; see below for other names) is the largest city in western Ukraine, as well as the sixth-largest city in Ukraine, with a population of It serves as the administrative centre of Lviv Oblast and Lviv Raion, and is one of the main cultural centres of Ukraine. Lviv also hosts the administration of Lviv urban hromada. It was named after Leo I of Galicia, the eldest son of Daniel, King of Ruthenia.

Lviv emerged as the centre of the historical regions of Red Ruthenia and Galicia in the 14th century, superseding Halych, Chełm, Belz, and Przemyśl. It was the capital of the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia from 1272 to 1349, when it was conquered by King Casimir III the Great of Poland. From 1434, it was the regional capital of the Ruthenian Voivodeship in the Kingdom of Poland. In 1772, after the First Partition of Poland, the city became the capital of the Habsburg Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. In 1918, for a short time, it was the capital of the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic. Between the wars, the city was the centre of the Lwów Voivodeship in the Second Polish Republic. After the German-Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, Lviv was annexed by the Soviet Union.

The once-large Jewish community of the city was murdered in large numbers by the Nazis and Ukrainian police during the Holocaust. For decades there was no working synagogue in Lviv after the final one was closed by the Soviets. The greater part of the once-predominant Polish population was sent to Poland during a population exchange between Poland and Soviet Ukraine in 1944–46.

The historical heart of the city, with its cobblestone streets and architectural assortment of Renaissance, Baroque, Neo-classicism and Art Nouveau, survived Soviet and German occupations during World War II largely unscathed. The historic city centre is on the UNESCO World Heritage List; however, it has been listed as an endangered site due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Due to the city&#x27;s Mediterranean aura, many Soviet movies set in places like Venice or Rome were actually shot in Lviv. In 1991, Lviv became part of the independent nation of Ukraine.

The city has many industries and institutions of higher education, such as Lviv University and Lviv Polytechnic. Lviv is also the home of many cultural institutions, including a philharmonic orchestra and the Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet.

==Names and symbols==
The city of Lviv is also historically known by different names in other languages – ; or (archaic) &quot;Leopoldstadt&quot; ; ; ; as well as a number of other names.

The coat of arms, the banner of the Lviv City Council and the logo, are the officially approved symbols of Lviv. The names or images of architectural and historical monuments are also considered symbols of the city by the Statute of Lviv.

Lviv&#x27;s modern coat of arms is based on the coat of arms from the city seal in the middle of the 14th century—a stone gate with three towers, and in the opening of the gate walks a golden lion. Lviv&#x27;s large coat of arms is a shield, with the coat of arms of the city, crowned with a silver crown with three edges, held by a lion and an ancient warrior.

Lviv&#x27;s flag is a blue square banner with an image of the city emblem and with yellow and blue triangles at the edges.

Lviv&#x27;s logo is an image of five colorful towers in Lviv and the slogan &quot;Lviv — open to the world&quot; under them. The Latin phrase &quot;Semper fidelis&quot; (&#x27;Always faithful&#x27;) was used as a motto on the former coat of arms of 1936–1939, but was no longer used after the Second World War.

==Geography==

Lviv is on the edge of the Roztochia Upland, about east of the Polish border and north of the eastern Carpathian Mountains. The average altitude of Lviv is above sea level. Its highest point is the &quot;Vysokyi Zamok&quot; (High Castle), above sea level. This castle has a commanding view of the historic city centre with its distinctive green-domed churches and intricate architecture.

The old walled city was at the foothills of the High Castle on the banks of the Poltva River. In the 13th century, the river was used to transport goods. In the early 20th century, the Poltva was covered over in areas where it flows through the city; the river flows directly beneath Lviv&#x27;s central street, , and the Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet.

===Climate===
Lviv&#x27;s climate is humid continental (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) with cold winters and warm summers. The average temperatures are in January and in July. The average annual rainfall is with the maximum in summer. Mean sunshine duration per year at Lviv is about 1,804 hours.
==History==


Archaeologists have demonstrated that the Lviv area was settled by the fifth century, with the gord at Chernecha Hora-Voznesensk Street in Lychakivskyi District attributed to White Croats. The city of Lviv was founded in 1250 by King Daniel of Galicia (1201–1264) in the Principality of Halych of Kingdom of Ruthenia. It was named in honor of his son Lev as Lvihorod which is consistent with names of other Ukrainian cities, such as Myrhorod, Sharhorod, Novhorod, Bilhorod, Horodyshche, and Horodok.

Earlier there was a settlement in the form of a borough with a characteristic layout element—an elongated market square. Daniel&#x27;s foundation of the stronghold was its next reconstruction after the Batu Khan invasion of 1240.

Lviv was invaded by the Mongols in 1261. Various sources relate the events, which range from the destruction of the castle to a complete razing of the town. All sources agree that it was on the orders of the Mongol general Burundai. The Shevchenko Scientific Society says that Burundai issued the order to raze the city. The Galician-Volhynian chronicle states that in 1261 &quot;Said Buronda to Vasylko: &#x27;Since you are at peace with me then raze all your castles&#x27;&quot;. Basil Dmytryshyn states that the order was implied to be the fortifications as a whole: &quot;If you wish to have peace with me, then destroy [all fortifications of] your towns&quot;.

After Daniel&#x27;s death, King Lev rebuilt the town around 1270, choosing Lviv as his residence, and made it the capital of Galicia-Volhynia. Around 1280 Armenians lived in Galicia and were mainly based in Lviv where they had their own archbishop.

In the 13th and early 14th centuries, Lviv was largely a wooden city, except for its several Galician-style stone churches. Some of them, like the Church of Saint Nicholas, have survived, although in a thoroughly rebuilt form. The town was inherited by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1340 and ruled by voivode Dmytro Dedko, the favourite of the Lithuanian prince Liubartas, until 1349.

The city and region was a destination of 50,000 Armenians fleeing from the Saljuq and Mongol invasions of Armenia.

===Galicia–Volhynia Wars===
During the wars over the succession of Galicia-Volhynia Principality in 1339 King Casimir III of Poland undertook an expedition and conquered Lviv in 1340, burning down the old princely castle. Poland ultimately gained control over Lviv and the adjacent region in 1349. From then on the population was subjected to attempts to both Polonize and Catholicize the population. The Lithuanians ravaged Lviv land in 1351 during the Halych-Volhyn Wars with Lviv being plundered and destroyed by duke Liubartas in 1353.

Casimir built a new city center (or founded a new town) in a basin, surrounded it by walls, and replaced the wooden palace by masonry castle – one of the two built by him. The old (Ruthenian) settlement, after it had been rebuilt, became known as the Krakovian Suburb in reference to the city of Kraków.

===Kingdom of Poland===
In 1349, the Kingdom of Ruthenia with its capital Lviv was annexed by the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. The kingdom was transformed into the Ruthenian domain of the Crown with Lviv as the capital. On 17 June 1356 King Casimir III the Great moved the city to a new location and granted it Magdeburg rights, which implied that all city matters were to be resolved by a council elected by the wealthy citizens. In 1362, the High Castle was completely rebuilt with stone replacing the previous wood. In 1358, the city became a seat of Roman Catholic Archdiocese, which initiated the spread of Latin Church onto the Ruthenian lands.

After Casimir had died in 1370, he was succeeded as king of Poland by his nephew, King Louis I of Hungary, who in 1372 put Lviv together with the region of Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia under the administration of his relative Vladislaus II of Opole, Duke of Opole. When in 1387 Władysław retreated from the post of its governor, Galicia-Volhynia became occupied by Hungary, but soon Jadwiga, the youngest daughter of Louis, and also the ruler of Poland and wife of King of Poland Władysław II Jagiełło, unified it directly with the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland.

The city&#x27;s prosperity during the following centuries is owed to the trade privileges granted to it by Casimir, Queen Jadwiga, and the subsequent Polish monarchs. Germans, Poles and Czechs formed the largest groups of newcomers. Most of the settlers were polonised by the end of the 15th century, and the city became a Polish island surrounded by the Ruthenian Orthodox population. In 1356, the Armenian diocese was founded centered at the Armenian Cathedral. Lwów was one of two main cultural and religious centers of Armenians in Poland alongside Kamieniec Podolski. In the early modern period, it also became one of the largest concentrations of Scots and Italians in Poland.

In 1412, the local archdiocese has developed into the Roman Catholic Metropolis, which since 1375 as diocese had been in Halych. The new metropolis included regional diocese in Lviv, Przemyśl, Chełm, Włodzimierz, Łuck, Kamieniec, as well as Siret and Kijów (see Old Cathedral of St. Sophia, Kyiv). The first Catholic Archbishop who resided in Lviv was Jan Rzeszowski.
In 1434, the Ruthenian domain of the Crown was transformed into the Ruthenian Voivodeship. In 1444, the city was granted the staple right, which resulted in its growing prosperity and wealth, as it became one of the major trading centres on the merchant routes between Central Europe and Black Sea region. It was also transformed into one of the main fortresses of the kingdom. As one of the largest and most influential royal cities of Poland, it enjoyed voting rights in the Royal elections in Poland, alongside other major cities such as Kraków, Poznań, Warsaw or Gdańsk. During the 17th century, it was the second largest city of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, with a population of about 30,000.

In 1572, one of the first publishers of books in what is now Ukraine, Ivan Fedorov, a graduate of the University of Kraków, settled here for a brief period. The city became a significant centre for Eastern Orthodoxy with the establishment of an Orthodox brotherhood, a Greek-Slavonic school, and a printer which published the first full versions of the Bible in Church Slavonic in 1580. A Jesuit Collegium was founded in 1608, and on 20 January 1661 King John II Casimir of Poland issued a decree granting it &quot;the honour of the academy and the title of the university&quot;.

The 17th century brought invading armies of Swedes, Hungarians, Turks, Russians and Cossacks to its gates. In 1648 an army of Cossacks and Crimean Tatars besieged the town. They captured the High Castle, murdering its defenders. The city itself was not sacked due to the fact that the leader of the revolution Bohdan Khmelnytsky accepted a ransom of 250,000 ducats, and the Cossacks marched north-west towards Zamość. It was one of two major cities in Poland which was not captured during the so-called &quot;Deluge&quot;: the other one was Gdańsk.
At that time, Lviv witnessed a historic scene, as here King John II Casimir made his famous Lwów Oath. On 1 April 1656, during a holy mass in Lviv&#x27;s Cathedral conducted by the papal legate Pietro Vidoni, John Casimir in a grandiose and elaborate ceremony entrusted the Commonwealth under the Blessed Virgin Mary&#x27;s protection, whom he announced as &quot;The Queen of the Polish Crown and other of his countries&quot;. He also swore to &quot;protect the Kingdom&#x27;s folk from any impositions and unjust bondage&quot;.

Two years later, John Casimir, in honor of the bravery of its residents, declared Lviv to be equal to two historic capitals of the Commonwealth, Kraków and Vilnius. In the same year, 1658, Pope Alexander VII declared the city to be Semper fidelis, in recognition of its key role in defending Europe and Roman Catholicism from the Ottoman Muslim invasion.

In 1672 it was surrounded by the Ottomans who also failed to conquer it. Three years later, the Battle of Lwów (1675) took place near the city. Lviv was captured for the first time since the Middle Ages by a foreign army in 1704 when Swedish troops under King Charles XII entered the city after a short siege. The plague of the early 18th century caused the death of about 10,000 inhabitants (40% of the city&#x27;s population).

===Habsburg Empire===

In 1772, following the First Partition of Poland, the region was annexed by the Habsburg monarchy to the Austrian Partition. Known in German as &quot;Lemberg&quot;, the city became the capital of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. Lemberg grew dramatically during the 19th century, increasing in population from approximately 30,000 at the time of the Austrian annexation in 1772, to 196,000 by 1910 and to 212,000 three years later; rapid population growth brought about an increase in urban squalor and poverty in Austrian Galicia. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries a large influx of Austrians and German-speaking Czech bureaucrats gave the city a character that by the 1840s was quite Austrian, in its orderliness and in the appearance and popularity of Austrian coffeehouses.

During Habsburg rule, Lviv became one of the most important Polish, Ukrainian and Jewish cultural centres. In Lviv, according to the Austrian census of 1910, which listed religion and language, 51% of the city&#x27;s population was Roman Catholics, 28% Jews, and 19% belonged to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. Linguistically, 86% of the city&#x27;s population used the Polish language and 11% preferred Ruthenian.
In 1773, the first newspaper in Lemberg, &quot;Gazette de Leopoli&quot;, began to be published. In 1784, a Latin language university was opened with lectures in German, Polish and even Ruthenian; after closing in 1805, it was reopened in 1817. By 1825, German became the sole language of instruction. Lemberg University was opened by Maria Theresa in 1784. By 1787, her successor Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor opened &quot;Studium Ruthenum&quot; for students who did not know enough Latin to take regular courses.

During the 19th century, the Austrian administration attempted to Germanise the city&#x27;s educational and governmental institutions. Many cultural organisations which did not have a pro-German orientation were closed. After the revolutions of 1848, the language of instruction at the university shifted from German to include Ukrainian and Polish. Around that time, a certain sociolect developed in the city known as the Lwów dialect. Considered to be a type of Polish dialect, it draws its roots from numerous other languages besides Polish. In 1853, kerosene lamps as street lighting were introduced by Ignacy Łukasiewicz and Jan Zeh. Then in 1858, these were updated to gas lamps, and in 1900 to electric ones.

After the so-called &quot;Ausgleich&quot; of February 1867, the Austrian Empire was reformed into a dualist Austria-Hungary and a slow yet steady process of liberalisation of Austrian rule in Galicia started. From 1873, Galicia was &quot;de facto&quot; an autonomous province of Austria-Hungary, with Polish and Ruthenian as official languages. Germanisation was halted and censorship lifted as well. Galicia was subject to the Austrian part of the Dual Monarchy, but the Galician Sejm and provincial administration, both established in Lviv, had extensive privileges and prerogatives, especially in education, culture, and local affairs. In 1894, the General National Exhibition was held in Lviv. The city started to grow rapidly, becoming the fourth largest in Austria-Hungary, according to the census of 1910. Many Belle Époque public edifices and tenement houses were erected, with many of the buildings from the Austrian period, such as the Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet, built in the Viennese neo-Renaissance style.

At that time, Lviv was home to a number of renowned Polish-language institutions, such as the Ossolineum, with the second-largest collection of Polish books in the world, the Polish Academy of Arts, the National Museum (since 1908), the Historical Museum of the City of Lwów (since 1891), the Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists, the Polish Historical Society, Lwów University, with Polish as the official language since 1882, the Lwów Scientific Society, the Lwów Art Gallery, the Polish Theatre, and the Polish Archdiocese.

Furthermore, Lviv was the centre of a number of Polish independence organisations. In June 1908, Józef Piłsudski, Władysław Sikorski and Kazimierz Sosnkowski founded here the Union of Active Struggle. Two years later, the paramilitary organisation, called the Riflemen&#x27;s Association, was also founded in the city by Polish activists.

At the same time, Lviv became the city where famous Ukrainian writers (such as Ivan Franko, Panteleimon Kulish and Ivan Nechuy-Levytsky) published their work. It was a centre of Ukrainian cultural revival. The city also housed the largest and most influential Ukrainian institutions in the world, including the Prosvita society dedicated to spreading literacy in the Ukrainian language, the Shevchenko Scientific Society, the Dniester Insurance Company and base of the Ukrainian cooperative movement, and it served as the seat of the Ukrainian Catholic Church. However, the Polish-dominated city council blocked Ukrainian attempts to create visible monumets for their own. The most important streets had names referring to Polish history and literature, and only minor roads referred to Ukrainians.

Lviv was also a major centre of Jewish culture, in particular as a centre of the Yiddish language, and was the home of the world&#x27;s first Yiddish-language daily newspaper, the &quot;Lemberger Togblat&quot;, established in 1904.

====First World War====

In the Battle of Galicia at the early stages of the First World War, Lviv was captured by the Russian army in September 1914 following the Battle of Gnila Lipa. The Lemberg Fortress fell on 3 September. The historian Pál Kelemen provided a first-hand account of the chaotic evacuation of the city by the Austro-Hungarian Army and civilians alike.

The town was retaken by Austria-Hungary in June the following year during the Gorlice–Tarnów offensive. Lviv and its population, therefore, suffered greatly during the First World War as many of the offensives were fought across its local geography causing significant collateral damage and disruption.

===Polish–Ukrainian War===

After the collapse of the Habsburg Monarchy at the end of the First World War, Lviv became an arena of battle between the local Polish population and the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen. Both nations perceived the city as an integral part of their new statehoods which at that time were forming in the former Austrian territories. On the night of 31 October – 1 November 1918 the Western Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic was proclaimed with Lviv as its capital. 2,300 Ukrainian soldiers from the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen (Sichovi Striltsi), which had previously been a corps in the Austrian Army, made an attempt to take over Lviv. The city&#x27;s Polish majority opposed the Ukrainian declaration and began to fight against the Ukrainian troops. During this combat an important role was taken by young Polish city defenders called Lwów Eaglets.

The Ukrainian forces withdrew outside Lwów&#x27;s confines by 21 November 1918, after which elements of Polish soldiers began to loot and burn much of the Jewish and Ukrainian quarters of the city, killing approximately 340 civilians (see: Lwów pogrom). The retreating Ukrainian forces besieged the city. The Sich riflemen reformed into the Ukrainian Galician Army (UHA). The Polish forces aided from central Poland, including General Haller&#x27;s Blue Army, equipped by the French, relieved the besieged city in May 1919 forcing the UHA to the east.

Despite Entente mediation attempts to cease hostilities and reach a compromise between belligerents the Polish–Ukrainian War continued until July 1919 when the last UHA forces withdrew east of the River Zbruch. The border on the River Zbruch was confirmed at the Treaty of Warsaw, when in April 1920 Field Marshal Piłsudski signed an agreement with Symon Petlura where it was agreed that in exchange for military support against the Bolsheviks the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic renounced its claims to the territories of Eastern Galicia.

In August 1920, Lviv was attacked by the Red Army under the command of Aleksandr Yegorov and Stalin during the Polish–Soviet War but the city repelled the attack. For the courage of its inhabitants Lviv was awarded the Virtuti Militari cross by Józef Piłsudski on 22 November 1920.

On 23 February 1921, the council of the League of Nations declared that Galicia (including the city) lay outside the territory of Poland and that Poland did not have the mandate to establish administrative control in that country, and that Poland was merely the occupying military power of Galicia (as a whole), whose sovereign remained the Allied Powers and fate would be determined by the Council of Ambassadors at the League of Nations. On 14 March 1923, the Council of Ambassadors decided that Galicia would be incorporated into Poland &quot;whereas it is recognised by Poland that ethnographical conditions necessitate an autonomous regime in the Eastern part of Galicia.&quot; This provision was never honoured by the interwar Polish government. After 1923, the region was internationally recognized as part of the Polish state.

===Interwar period===

During the interwar period Lviv was the Second Polish Republic&#x27;s third-most populous city (following Warsaw and Łódź), and it became the seat of the Lwów Voivodeship. Following Warsaw, Lviv was the second most important cultural and academic centre of interwar Poland. For example, in 1920 Professor Rudolf Weigl of Lwów University developed a vaccine against typhus fever. Furthermore, the geographic location of Lviv gave it an important role in stimulating international trade and fostering the city&#x27;s and Poland&#x27;s economic development. A major trade fair named Targi Wschodnie was established in 1921. In the academic year 1937–1938, there were 9,100 students attending five institutions of higher education, including Lwów University as well as the Polytechnic.
While about two-thirds of the city&#x27;s inhabitants were Poles, some of whom spoke the characteristic Lwów dialect, the eastern part of the Lwów Voivodeship had a relative Ukrainian majority in most of its rural areas. Although Polish authorities were obliged through international agreements to provide Eastern Galicia with autonomy (including the creation of a separate Ukrainian university in Lviv), and even though in September 1922 the Polish Sejm&#x27;s Bill was enacted, this was not fulfilled.

The Polish government discontinued many Ukrainian schools which functioned during the Austrian rule, and closed down Ukrainian departments at the University of Lwów with the exception of one. Prewar Lviv also had a large and thriving Jewish community, which constituted about a quarter of the population, but were accused of having collaborated with the Ukrainians.

Unlike in Austrian times, when the size and number of public parades or other cultural expressions corresponded to each cultural group&#x27;s relative population, the Polish government emphasised the Polish nature of the city and limited public displays of Jewish and Ukrainian culture. Military parades and commemorations of battles at particular streets within the city, all celebrating the Polish forces who fought against the Ukrainians in 1918, became frequent, and in the 1930s a vast memorial monument and burial ground of Polish soldiers from that conflict was built in the city&#x27;s Lychakiv Cemetery. On the other hand, Ukrainians strove to create their own memorial culture in the town. An underground military organization attacked Polish institutions, as well as Polish politicians.

===World War II===
====Soviet occupation and incorporation====

Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939 and by 14 September Lviv was completely encircled by German Army units. Subsequently, the Soviets invaded Poland on 17 September. On 22 September 1939 Lviv capitulated to the Red Army. The USSR annexed the eastern half of the Second Polish Republic with Ukrainian and Belarusian populations. The city became the capital of the newly formed Lviv Oblast. The Soviets reopened uni-lingual Ukrainian schools, which had been discontinued by the Polish government.

The only change over imposed by the Soviets was the language of instruction, with the actual net loss of about 1,000 schools in short order. Ukrainian was made compulsory in the University of Lviv with almost all its books in Polish. It became thoroughly Ukrainized and was renamed after Ukrainian writer Ivan Franko. Polish academics were laid off. Soviet rule turned out to be much more oppressive than Polish rule; the rich world of Ukrainian publications in Polish Lviv, for instance, was gone in Soviet Lviv, and many journalism jobs were lost with it.

====German occupation====

On 22 June 1941, Nazi Germany and several of its allies invaded the USSR. In the initial stage of Operation Barbarossa (30 June 1941) Lviv was taken by the Germans. The evacuating Soviets killed most of the prison population, with arriving Wehrmacht forces easily discovering evidence of the Soviet mass murders in the city committed by the NKVD and NKGB. On 30 June 1941 Yaroslav Stetsko proclaimed in Lviv the Government of an independent Ukrainian state allied with Nazi Germany. This was done without preapproval from the Germans and after 15 September 1941, the organisers were arrested.

The Sikorski–Mayski Agreement signed in London on 30 July 1941 between Polish government-in-exile and USSR&#x27;s government invalidated the September 1939 Soviet-German partition of Poland, as the Soviets declared it null and void. Meanwhile, German-occupied Eastern Galicia at the beginning of August 1941 was incorporated into the General Government as &quot;Distrikt Galizien&quot; with Lviv as the district&#x27;s capital. German policy towards the Polish population in this area was as harsh as in the rest of the General Government.

Germans during the occupation of the city committed numerous atrocities including the killing of Polish university professors in 1941. German Nazis viewed the Ukrainian Galicians, former inhabitants of Austrian Crown Land, as to some point more aryanised and civilised than the Ukrainian population living in the territories belonging to the USSR before 1939. As a result, they escaped the full extent of German acts in comparison to Ukrainians who lived to the east, in the German-occupied Soviet Ukraine turned into the &quot;Reichskommissariat Ukraine&quot;.
According to the Third Reich&#x27;s racial policies, local Jews then became the main target of German repressions in the region. Following the German occupation, the Jewish population was concentrated in the Lwów Ghetto established in the city&#x27;s Zamarstynów (today &quot;Zamarstyniv&quot;) district and the Janowska concentration camp was also set up. In the Janowska concentration camp, the Nazis conducted torture and executions to music. The Lviv National Opera members, who were prisoners, played one and the same tune, Tango of Death.

On the eve of Lviv&#x27;s liberation, German Nazis ordered 40 orchestra musicians to form a circle. The security ringed the musicians tightly and ordered them to play. First, the orchestra conductor, Mund, was executed. Then the commandant ordered the musicians to come to the center of the circle one by one, put their instruments onto the ground and strip naked, after which they were killed by a headshot. A photo of the orchestra players was one of the incriminating documents at the Nuremberg trials.

In 1931 there were 75,316 Yiddish-speaking inhabitants, but by 1941 approximately 100,000 Jews were present in Lviv. The majority of these Jews were either killed within the city or deported to Belzec extermination camp. In the summer of 1943, on the orders of Heinrich Himmler, SS-Standartenführer Paul Blobel was tasked with the destruction of any evidence of Nazi mass murders in the Lviv area. On 15 June Blobel, using forced labourers from Janowska, dug up a number of mass graves and incinerated the remains.

Later, on 19 November 1943, inmates at Janowska staged an uprising and attempted a mass escape. A few succeeded, but most were recaptured and killed. The SS staff and their local auxiliaries then, at the time of the Janowska camp&#x27;s liquidation, murdered at least 6,000 more inmates, as well as the Jews in other forced labour camps in Galicia. By the end of the war, the Jewish population of the city was virtually eliminated, with only around 200 to 800 survivors remaining.

====Soviet re-occupation====
After the successful Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive of July 1944, the Soviet 3rd Guards Tank Army captured Lwów on 27 July 1944, with significant cooperation from the local Polish resistance. Soon thereafter, the local commanders of Polish &quot;Armia Krajowa&quot; were invited to a meeting with the commanders of the Red Army. During the meeting, they were arrested, as it turned out to be a trap set by the Soviet NKVD. Later, in the winter and spring of 1945, the local NKVD continued to arrest and harass Poles in Lwów (which according to Soviet sources on 1 October 1944 still had a clear Polish majority of 66.7%) in an attempt to encourage their emigration from the city.

Those arrested were released only after they had signed papers in which they agreed to emigrate to Poland, which postwar borders were to be shifted westwards in accordance with the Yalta conference settlements. In Yalta, despite Polish objections, the Allied leaders, Joseph Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill decided that Lwów should remain within the borders of the Soviet Union. Roosevelt wanted Poland to have Lwów and the surrounding oilfields, but Stalin refused to allow it.

On 16 August 1945, a border agreement was signed in Moscow between the government of the Soviet Union and the Provisional Government of National Unity installed by the Soviets in Poland. In the treaty, Polish authorities formally ceded the prewar eastern part of the country to the Soviet Union, agreeing to the Polish-Soviet border to be drawn according to the Curzon Line. Consequently, the agreement was ratified on 5 February 1946.

=== Soviet Era ===
In February 1946, Lviv became a part of the Soviet Union. It is estimated that from 100,000 to 140,000 Poles were resettled from the city into the so-called Recovered Territories as a part of postwar population transfers, many of them to the area of newly acquired Wrocław, formerly the German city of Breslau. Many buildings in the old part of the city are examples of Polish architecture, which flourished in Lviv after the opening of the Technical School (later Polytechnic), the first higher-education technical academy in Polish lands. Polytechnic educated generations of architects who were influential in the entire country. Examples are: the main buildings of Lviv Polytechnic, University of Lviv, Lviv Opera, Lviv railway station, former building of Galicyjska Kasa Oszczędności, Potocki Palace.

During the interwar period, Lviv was striving to become a modern metropolis, so architects experimented with modernism. It was the period of the most rapid growth of the city, so one can find many examples of architecture from this time in the city. Examples include the main building of Lviv Academy of Commerce, the second Sprecher&#x27;s building or building of City Electrical Facilities. One monument of the Polish past is the Adam Mickiewicz Monument at the square bearing his name.

Many Polish pieces of art and sculpture can be found in Lviv galleries, among them works by Jan Piotr Norblin, Marcello Bacciarelli, Kazimierz Wojniakowski, Antoni Brodowski, Henryk Rodakowski, Artur Grottger, Jan Matejko, Aleksander Gierymski, Jan Stanisławski, Leon Wyczółkowski, Józef Chełmoński, Józef Mehoffer, Stanisław Wyspiański, Olga Boznańska, Władysław Słowiński, Jacek Malczewski. Poles who stayed in Lviv have formed the organisation the Association of Polish Culture of the Lviv Land.

According to various estimates, Lviv lost between 80% and 90% of its prewar population. Expulsion of the Polish population and the Holocaust together with migration from Ukrainian-speaking surrounding areas (including forcibly resettled from the territories which, after the war, became part of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic), from other parts of the Soviet Union, altered the ethnic composition of the city. Immigration from Russia and Russian-speaking regions of Eastern Ukraine was encouraged. The prevalence of the Ukrainian-speaking population has led to the fact that under the conditions of Soviet Russification, Lviv became a major centre of the dissident movement in Ukraine and played a key role in Ukraine&#x27;s independence in 1991.

In the 1950s and 1960s, the city expanded both in population and size mostly due to the city&#x27;s rapidly growing industrial base. Due to the fight of SMERSH with the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, Lviv obtained a nickname with a negative connotation of &quot;Banderstadt&quot; as the City of Stepan Bandera. The German suffix for the city &quot;stadt&quot; was added instead of the Russian &quot;grad&quot; to imply alienation. Over the years the residents of the city found this so ridiculous that even people not familiar with Bandera accepted it as sarcasm in reference to the Soviet perception of western Ukraine. In the period of liberalisation from the Soviet system in the 1980s, the city became the centre of political movements advocating Ukrainian independence from the USSR. By the time of the fall of the Soviet Union the name became a proud mark for the Lviv natives culminating in the creation of a local rock band under the name &quot;Khloptsi z Bandershtadtu&quot; (Boys from Banderstadt).

On 17 September 1989 Lviv saw the largest rally in support of Ukraine&#x27;s independence from the Soviet Union, gathering some 100,000 participants.

===Independent Ukraine===

Citizens of Lviv strongly supported Viktor Yushchenko during the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election and played a key role in the Orange Revolution. Hundreds of thousands of people would gather in freezing temperatures to demonstrate for the Orange camp. Acts of civil disobedience forced the head of the local police to resign and the local assembly issued a resolution refusing to accept the fraudulent first official results. Lviv remains today one of the main centres of Ukrainian culture and the origin of much of the nation&#x27;s political class.

In support of the Euromaidan movement, Lviv&#x27;s executive committee declared itself independent of the rule of President Viktor Yanukovych on 19 February 2014.

In 2019 citizens of Lviv supported Petro Poroshenko during the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election. The percentage of votes counted for Poroshenko was more than 90%. Despite this level of support in Lviv, he lost the national vote.

Until 18 July 2020, Lviv was incorporated as a city of oblast significance and the center of Lviv Municipality. The municipality was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Lviv Oblast to seven. The area of Lviv Municipality was merged into the newly established Lviv Raion.

====Russo-Ukrainian War====
=====Russian invasion of Ukraine=====
During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Lviv became the nation&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; western capital in February 2022 as some embassies, government agencies, and media organizations were relocated from Kyiv due to the direct military threat to the capital. Lviv also became a safe haven for the Ukrainians fleeing other parts of the country affected by the invasion, their number exceeding 200,000 as of 18 March 2022. Many used the city as a stopping point on their way to Poland. Lviv and the larger region around it also served as crucial arms and humanitarian supply route. Bracing for Russian attacks, local government and citizens, helped by the Polish and Croatian advisers, worked to protect the city&#x27;s cultural heritage by erecting makeshift barriers around historical monuments, wrapping statues, and safeguarding art treasures.

In the course of the war, the area in and around Lviv was struck by Russian missile attacks, hitting the Yavoriv military training base on 13 March 2022, the Lviv State Aircraft Repair Plant near the Lviv Danylo Halytskyi International Airport on 18 March 2022, and a fuel depot and other facilities within the city limits on 26 March 2022.

According to Mayor Andriy Sadoviy, on 18 April 2022, the city was hit by five missile strikes. Seven civilians were killed and 11 were wounded. Regional governor Maksym Kozystkiy said that the targets were military factories and a tyre shop. A hotel housing evacuees was hit, damaging windows. On 18 April, TASS quoted the Russian Ministry of Defence that confirmed 315 targets were struck by Russian missiles overnight. The statement claimed that all targets were of a military nature.

Lviv was targeted during the 10 October 2022 missile strikes on Ukraine, resulting in a city-wide blackout. On 11 October 2022, Mayor Sadoviy reported that the city was hit by a missile strike, resulting in a power outage and water supply shortage.

==Administrative divisions==
Lviv is divided into six urban districts (raions), each with its own administrative bodies:

*Halytskyi District ()
*Zaliznychnyi District (), literally &quot;railway neighborhood&quot;
*Lychakivskyi District ()
*Sykhivskyi District ()
*Frankivskyi District (), named after Ivan Franko.
*Shevchenkivskyi District (), named after Taras Shevchenko.

Notable suburbs include Vynnyky (), Briukhovychi (), and Rudne ().

==Demographics==
Lviv residents live 75 years on average, and this age is 7 years longer than the average age in Ukraine and 8 years more than the world average (68 years). In 2010 the average life expectancy was 71 among men and 79.5 years among women. The fertility rates have been steadily increasing between 2001 and 2010; however, the effects of low fertility in the previous years remained noticeable even though the birth rates grew. However, there is an acute shortage of young people under the age of 25. In 2011, 13.7% of Lviv&#x27;s population consisted of young people under 15 years and 17.6% of persons aged 60 years and over.

===Language===

The majority of Leopolitans speak Ukrainian. The use of Ukrainian in the city has surged since the 1970s, while the use of Russian has declined since the 1980s. In 2000, it was estimated that 80% of Leopolitans spoke Ukrainian.

Results of the 2001 census:
According to one survey conducted by the International Republican Institute in mid-2023, 96% of the city&#x27;s inhabitants spoke Ukrainian at home, while 3% of them spoke Russian.

===Ethnic Polish population===
Ethnic Poles and the Polish Jews began to settle in Lwów in considerable numbers already in 1349 after the city was conquered by King Casimir of the Piast dynasty. Lwów served as Poland&#x27;s major cultural and economic centre for several centuries, during the Polish Golden Age, and until the partitions of Poland perpetrated by Russia, Prussia, and Austria. In the Second Polish Republic, the Lwów Voivodeship (inhabited by 2,789,000 people in 1921) grew to 3,126,300 inhabitants in ten years.

As a result of World War II, Lviv was de-Polonised, mainly through Soviet-arranged population exchange in 1944–1946 but also by early deportations to Siberia. Those who remained on their own volition after the border shift became a small ethnic minority in Lviv. By 1959 Poles made up only 4% of the local population. Many families were mixed. During the Soviet decades only two Polish schools continued to function: No. 10 (with 8 grades) and No. 24 (with 10 grades).

In the 1980s the process of uniting groups into ethnic associations was allowed. In 1988 a Polish-language newspaper was permitted (&quot;Gazeta Lwowska&quot;). The Polish population of the city continues to use the dialect of the Polish language known as &quot;Lwów dialect&quot; ().

Association of Poles named White Eagle was founded in Lviv in 2011.

===Jewish population===
The first known Jews in Lviv date back to the tenth century. The oldest remaining Jewish tombstone dates back to 1348. Apart from the Rabbanite Jews there were many Karaites who had settled in the city after coming from the East and from Byzantium. After Casimir III conquered Lviv in 1349 the Jewish citizens received many privileges equal to that of other citizens of Poland. Lviv had two separate Jewish quarters, one within the city walls and one outside on the outskirts of the city. Each had its separate synagogue, although they shared a cemetery, which was also used by the Crimean Karaite community. Before 1939 there were 97 synagogues.

Before the Holocaust about one-third of the city&#x27;s population was made up of Jews (more than 140,000 on the eve of World War II). This number swelled to about 240,000 by the end of 1940 as tens of thousands of Jews fled from the Nazi-occupied parts of Poland into the relative (and temporary) sanctuary of Soviet-occupied Poland (including Lviv) following the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact that divided Poland into Nazi and Soviet zones in 1939. Most of the Jewish population was killed in the Holocaust. Meanwhile, the Nazis also destroyed the Jewish cemetery, which was subsequently &quot;paved over by the Soviets&quot;.

Due to the Holocaust and migration, the original Jewish population of the city all but vanished. After the war, the remnant was replenished by a newer Jewish population, formed from among the hundreds of thousands of Russians and Ukrainians who migrated to the city. The post-war Jewish population peaked at 30,000 in the 1970s. Currently, the Jewish population has shrunk considerably as a result of emigration (mainly to Israel and the United States) and, to a lesser degree, assimilation, and is estimated to number a few thousand. A number of organisations continue to be active.

The Sholem Aleichem Jewish Culture Society in Lviv initiated the construction of a monument to the victims of the ghetto in 1988. On 23 August 1992, the memorial complex to the victims of the Lwów ghetto (1941–1943) was officially opened. During 2011–2012, some anti-Semitic acts against the memorial took place. On 20 March 2011, it was reported that the slogan &quot;death to the Jews&quot; with a swastika was sprayed on the monument. On 21 March 2012, the memorial was vandalized by unknown individuals, in what seemed to be an anti-Semitic act.

==Economy==

Lviv is the most important business centre of Western Ukraine. As of 1 January 2011, the city has invested 837.1 million US dollars into the economy, accounting for almost two-thirds of total investment in the Lviv region.

There are several banks based in Lviv, such as Kredobank, Idea Bank, VS Bank, Oksi Bank and Lviv Bank. None of these banks have bankrupted during the political and economic crisis of 2014–2016. It can be explained by the presence of foreign capital in most of them.

From 2015 to 2019, the city experienced a construction boom. In Q1 2019, according to statistical data, growth in the volume of new housing construction was recorded in Lviv (3.2 times, to 377,900 square meters).

Lviv is a major business center between Warsaw and Kyiv.

===Information technology===

Lviv is also one of the leaders of software export in Eastern Europe with expected sector growth of 20% by 2020. Over 15% of all IT specialists in Ukraine work in Lviv, with over 4100 new IT graduates coming from local universities each year. About 2,500 tech enthusiasts attended Lviv IT Arena, the largest technology conference in Western Ukraine. Over 24,000 IT specialists work in Lviv as of 2019. Lviv is among top five most popular Ukrainian cities for opening R&amp;D center in IT and IT outsourcing spheres together with Kyiv, Dnipro, Kharkiv and Odesa.

In 2009, KPMG, one of the well-known international auditing companies, included Lviv in top 30 cities with the greatest potential of information technology development. As of December 2015, there were 192 IT-companies operating in the city, of which 4 large (with more than 400 employees), 16 average (150–300 employees), 97 small (10–110 employees) and 70 micro companies (3–7 employees).

Lviv IT outsourcing companies gathered all kinds of Ukrainian developers in one place, resulting in many front-end interns, JavaScript developers, back-end and full-stack coders with proper qualifications, experience, and good English language skills. Some IT companies in Lviv offer outsourcing software services to international corporations rather than developing their software product.

==Culture==
Lviv is one of Ukraine&#x27;s most important cultural centres. It is known as a centre of art, literature, music and theatre. Nowadays, the evidence of the city&#x27;s cultural richness is the number of theatres, concert halls, and creative unions, and the high number of artistic activities (more than 100 festivals annually, 60 museums, and 10 theatres).

Lviv&#x27;s historic centre has been on the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage list since 1998. UNESCO gave the following reasons for its selection:

The World Heritage Site consists of Seredmistia (Middletown), Pidzamche, High Castle, and the ensemble of St. George&#x27;s Cathedral.

===Architecture===
Lviv&#x27;s historic churches, buildings and relics date from the 13th century to the early 20th century (Polish and Austro-Hungarian rule). In recent centuries Lviv was spared some of the invasions and wars that destroyed other Ukrainian cities. Its architecture reflects various European styles and periods. After the fires of 1527 and 1556 Lviv lost most of its gothic-style buildings but it retains many buildings in renaissance, baroque and the classic styles. There are works by artists of the Vienna Secession, Art Nouveau and Art Deco.

The buildings have many stone sculptures and carvings, particularly on large doors, which are hundreds of years old. The remains of old churches dot the central cityscape. Some three- to five-storey buildings have hidden inner courtyards and grottoes in various states of repair. Some cemeteries are of interest: for example, the Lychakivskiy Cemetery where the Polish elite was buried for centuries. Leaving the central area the architectural style changes radically as Soviet-era high-rise blocks dominate. In the centre of the city, the Soviet era is reflected mainly in a few modern-style national monuments and sculptures.

===Monuments===


Outdoor sculptures in the city commemorate many notable individuals and topics reflecting the rich and complex history of Lviv. There are monuments to Adam Mickiewicz, Ivan Franko, King Danylo, Taras Shevchenko, Ivan Fedorov, Solomiya Krushelnytska, Ivan Pidkova, Mykhailo Hrushevskyi, Pope John Paul II, Jan Kiliński, Ivan Trush, Saint George, Bartosz Głowacki, the monument to the Virgin Mary, to Nikifor, The Good Soldier Švejk, Stepan Bandera, Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, and many others.

During the interwar period there were monuments commemorating important figures of Polish history. Some of them were moved to the Polish &quot;Recovered Territories&quot; after World War II, like the Monument to Aleksander Fredro, which now is in Wrocław, the Monument of King John III Sobieski, which after 1945 was moved to Gdańsk, and the monument of Kornel Ujejski, which is now in Szczecin. A book market takes place around the monument to Ivan Fеdorovych, a typographer in the 16th century who fled Moscow and found a new home in Lviv.

New ideas came to Lviv during Austro–Hungarian rule. In the 19th century, many publishing houses, newspapers and magazines were established. Among these was the Ossolineum which was one of the most important Polish scientific libraries. Most Polish-language books and publications of the Ossolineum library are still kept in a local Jesuit church. In 1997 the Polish government asked the Ukrainian government to return these documents to Poland. In 2003, Ukraine allowed access to these publications for the first time. In 2006, an office of the Ossolineum (now in Wrocław) opened in Lviv and began scanning all its documents. Works written in Lviv contributed to Austrian, Ukrainian, Yiddish, and Polish literature, with a multitude of translations.

===Religion===
Lviv is a city of religious variety. Religion (2012): Catholic: 57% (Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church 56% and Roman Catholic Church 1%), Orthodox: 32%, Protestantism: 2%, Judaism: 0.1%, Other religion: 3%, Indifferent to religious matters: 4%, Atheism: 1.9%.

====Christianity====
At one point, over 60 churches existed in the city. Christian groups have existed in the city since the 13th century. The city has been the episcopal see of three different particular churches of Catholic Church: The Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Lviv of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, the Archdiocese of Lviv of the Latin Church, and formerly the Armenian Catholic Archeparchy of Lviv of the Armenian Catholic Church. Each has had a diocesan seat in Lviv since the 16th century. At the end of the 16th century, the Eastern Orthodox community in Ukraine transferred their allegiance to the Pope in Rome and became the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. This bond was forcibly dissolved in 1946 by the Soviet authorities and the Roman Catholic community was forced out by the expulsion of the Polish population. Since 1989, religious life in Lviv has experienced a revival. About 35 percent of religious buildings belong to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, 11.5 percent to the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, 9 per cent to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Kyiv Patriarchate and 6 per cent to the Roman Catholic Church.

In June 2001, Pope John Paul II visited the Latin Cathedral, St. George&#x27;s Cathedral and the Armenian Cathedral.

====Judaism====
Lviv historically had a large and active Jewish community and until 1941, at least 45 synagogues and prayer houses existed. Even in the 16th century, two separate communities existed. One lived in today&#x27;s old town with the other in the Krakowskie Przedmieście. The Golden Rose Synagogue was built in Lviv in 1582. In the 19th century, a more differentiated community started to spread out. Liberal Jews sought more cultural assimilation and spoke German and Polish. On the other hand, Orthodox and Hasidic Jews tried to retain the old traditions. Between 1941 and 1944, the Germans in effect completely destroyed the centuries-old Jewish tradition of Lviv. Most synagogues were destroyed and the Jewish population was forced first into a ghetto before being forcibly transported to concentration camps where they were murdered.

Under the Soviet Union, synagogues remained closed and were used as warehouses or cinemas. The last functioning synagogue was closed in the 1960s. Only since the fall of the Iron Curtain, has the remainder of the Jewish community experienced a faint revival.

Currently, the only functioning Orthodox Jewish synagogue in Lviv is the Beis Aharon V&#x27;Yisrael Synagogue.

===Arts===
The range of artistic Lviv is impressive. On the one hand, it is the city of classical art. Lviv Opera and Lviv Philharmonic are places that can satisfy the demands of true appraisers of the classical arts. This is the city of one of the most distinguished sculptors in Europe, Johann Georg Pinzel, whose works can be seen on the façade of the St. George&#x27;s Cathedral in Lviv and in the Pinzel Museum. This is also the city of Solomiya Krushelnytska, who began her career as a singer in Lviv Opera and later became the prima donna of La Scala Opera in Milan.

The &quot;Group Artes&quot; was a young movement founded in 1929. Many of the artists studied in Paris and travelled throughout Europe. They worked and experimented in different areas of modern art: Futurism, Cubism, New Objectivity and Surrealism. Co–operation took place between avant-garde musicians and authors. Altogether thirteen exhibitions by &quot;Artes&quot; took place in Warsaw, Kraków, Łódz and Lviv. The German occupation put an end to this group. Otto Hahn was executed in 1942 in Lviv and Aleksander Riemer was murdered in Auschwitz in 1943.

Henryk Streng and Margit Reich-Sielska were able to escape the Holocaust (or Shoah). Most of the surviving members of Artes lived in Poland after 1945. Only Margit Reich-Sielska (1900–1980) and Roman Sielski (1903–1990) stayed in Soviet Lviv. For years the city was one of the most important cultural centres of Poland with such writers as Aleksander Fredro, Gabriela Zapolska, Leopold Staff, Maria Konopnicka and Jan Kasprowicz living in Lviv.

Today Lviv is a city of fresh ideas and unusual characters. There are about 20 galleries (Lviv Municipal Art Center, The &quot;Dzyga&quot; Gallery, Art-Gallery &quot;Primus&quot;, Gallery of the History of Ukrainian Military Uniforms, Gallery of Modern Art &quot;Zelena Kanapa&quot; and others). Lviv National Art Gallery is the largest museum of arts in Ukraine, with approximately 50,000 artworks, including paintings, sculptures and works of graphic art from Western and Eastern Europe, from the Middle Ages to the modern days.

===Theatre and opera===

In 1842 the Skarbek Theatre was opened making it the third-largest theatre in Central Europe. In 1903 the Lviv National Opera house, which at that time was called the City-Theatre, was opened emulating the Vienna State Opera house. The house initially offered a changing repertoire such as classical dramas in German and Polish language, opera, operetta, comedy and theatre.
The opera house is named after the Ukrainian opera diva Salomea Krushelnytska who worked here.

In the Janowska concentration camp, the Nazis conducted torture and executions to music. To do so they brought almost the whole Lviv National Opera to the camp. Professor Shtriks, opera conductor Mund and other famous Jewish musicians were among the members. From 1941 to 1944 the Nazis massacred 200,000 people including all 40 musicians.

Nowadays Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet has a large creative group of performers who strive to maintain traditions of Ukrainian opera and classical ballet. The Theatre is a well-organized creative body where over 500 people work towards a common goal. The repertoire includes 10 Ukrainian music compositions. No other similar theatre in Ukraine has such a large number of Ukrainian productions. There are also many operas written by foreign composers, and most of these operas are performed in the original language: &quot;Othello&quot;, &quot;Aida&quot;, &quot;La Traviata&quot;, &quot;Nabucco&quot;, and &quot;A Masked Ball&quot; by G. Verdi, &quot;Tosca&quot;, &quot;La Bohème&quot; and &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot; by G. Puccini, &quot;Cavalleria Rusticana&quot; by P. Mascagni, and &quot;Pagliacci&quot; by R.

Its prestige greatly increased through the work of philosopher Kazimierz Twardowski (1866–1938) who was one of the founders of the Lwów-Warsaw School of Logic. This school of thought set benchmarks for academic research and education in Poland. The Polish politician of the interbellum period Stanisław Głąbiński had served as dean of the law department (1889–1890) and as the university rector (1908–1909). In 1901 the city was the seat of the Lwów Scientific Society among whose members were major scientific figures.

== Sport ==
Lviv was an important centre for sport in Central Europe and is regarded as the birthplace of Polish football. Lviv is the Polish birthplace of other sports. In January 1905 the first Polish ice-hockey match took place there and two years later the first ski-jumping competition was organised in nearby Sławsko. In the same year, the first Polish basketball games were organised in Lviv&#x27;s gymnasiums. In autumn 1887 a gymnasium by Lychakiv Street (pol. &quot;ulica Łyczakowska&quot;) held the first Polish track and field competition with such sports as the long jump and high jump. Lviv&#x27;s athlete Władysław Ponurski represented Austria in the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm. On 9 July 1922 the first official rugby game in Poland took place at the stadium of Pogoń Lwów in which the rugby team of Orzeł Biały Lwów divided itself into two teams – &quot;The Reds&quot; and &quot;The Blacks&quot;. The referee of this game was a Frenchman by the name of Robineau.

=== Association football ===

The first known official goal in a Polish football match was scored at Pogoń Lwów on 14 July 1894 during the Lwów-Kraków game. The goal was scored by Włodzimierz Chomicki who represented the team of Lviv. In 1904 Kazimierz Hemerling from Lviv published the first translation of the rules of football into Polish and another native of Lviv, Stanisław Polakiewicz, became the first officially recognised Polish referee in 1911 the year in which the first Polish Football Federation was founded in Lviv.

The first Polish professional football club, Czarni Lwów opened here in 1903 and the first stadium, which belonged to Pogoń, in 1913. Another club, Pogoń Lwów, was four times football champion of Poland (1922, 1923, 1925 and 1926). In the late 1920s, as many as four teams from the city played in the Polish Football League (Pogoń, Czarni, Hasmonea and Lechia). Hasmonea was the first Jewish football club in Poland. Several notable figures of Polish football came from the city including Kazimierz Górski, Ryszard Koncewicz, Michał Matyas and Wacław Kuchar.

In the period 1900–1911 opened the most famous football clubs in Lviv. Professor Ivan Bobersky has based in the Academic grammar school the first Ukrainian sports circle where schoolboys were engaged in track and field, football, boxing, hockey, skiing, tourism and sledge sports in 1906. He organised the &quot;Ukrainian Sports circle&quot; in 1908. Much its pupils in due course in 1911 formed a sports society with the loud name &quot;Ukraine&quot; – the first Ukrainian football club in Lviv.

Lviv now has several major professional football clubs and some smaller clubs. Two teams from the city, FC Rukh Lviv and FC Lviv, currently play in the Ukrainian Premier League, the top level of football in the country. FC Karpaty Lviv, founded in 1963, has historically been the largest club in the city.

Bandera led the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, which fought alongside Nazi Germany during WWII, killing thousands of Jews and Poles. In 1940, Shukhevych commanded a military unit of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) that actively collaborated with the Nazis.

==Public transport==
Historically, the first horse-drawn tramway lines in Lviv were inaugurated on 5 May 1880. An electric tram was introduced on 31 May 1894. The last horse-drawn line was transferred to electric traction in 1908. In 1922 the tramways were switched to driving on the right-hand side. After the annexation of the city by the Soviet Union, several lines were closed but most of the infrastructure was preserved. The tracks are narrow-gauge, unusual for the Soviet Union, but explained by the fact that the system was built while the city was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and needed to run in narrow medieval streets in the centre of town.

The Lviv tramway system now runs about 220 cars on of track. Many tracks were reconstructed around 2006. The price in February 2019 of a tram/trolleybus ticket was 5 UAH (the reduced fare ticket was 2.5 UAH, e.g. for students). The ticket may be purchased from the driver.

After World War II the city grew rapidly due to evacuees returning from Russia, and the Soviet Government&#x27;s vigorous development of heavy industry. This included the transfer of entire factories from the Urals and others to the newly &quot;liberated&quot; territories of the USSR. The city centre tramway lines were replaced with trolleybuses on 27 November 1952. New lines were opened to the blocks of flats at the city outskirts.

The network now runs about 100 trolleybuses – mostly of the 1980s Skoda 14Tr and LAZ 52522. From 2006 to 2008 11 modern low-floor trolleybuses (LAZ E183) built by the Lviv Bus Factory were purchased. The public bus network is represented by mini-buses (so-called &quot;marshrutka&quot;) and large buses mainly LAZ and MAN. On 1 January 2013, the city had 52 public bus routes. The price is 7.00 UAH regardless of the distance travelled. The ticket may be purchased from the driver.

===Railways===
Modern Lviv remains a hub on which nine railways converge providing local and international services. Lviv railway is one of the oldest in Ukraine. The first train arrived in Lviv on 4 November 1861. The main Lviv Railway Station, designed by Władysław Sadłowski, was built in 1904 and was considered one of the best in Europe from both the architectural and technical aspects.

In the inter-war period, Lviv (known then as Lwów) was one of the most important hubs of the Polish State Railways. The Lwów junction consisted of four stations in mid-1939 – main station &quot;Lwów Główny&quot; (now ), Lwów Kleparów (now &quot;Lviv Klepariv&quot;), &quot;Lwów Łyczaków&quot; (now &quot;Lviv Lychakiv&quot;), and &quot;Lwów Podzamcze&quot; (now &quot;Lviv Pidzamche&quot;). In August 1939 just before World War II, 73 trains departed daily from the Main Station including 56 local and 17 fast trains. Lwów was directly connected with all major centres of the Second Polish Republic as well as such cities as Berlin, Bucharest, and Budapest.

Currently, several trains cross the nearby Polish–Ukrainian border (mostly via Przemyśl in Poland). There are good connections to Slovakia (Košice) and Hungary (Budapest). Many routes have overnight trains with sleeping compartments. Lviv railway is often called the main gateway from Ukraine to Europe although buses are often a cheaper and more convenient way of entering the &quot;Schengen&quot; countries.

Lviv used to have a Railbus, which has since been replaced with other means of public transport. It was a motor-rail car that ran from the largest district of Lviv to one of the largest industrial zones going through the central railway station. It made seven trips a day and was meant to provide a faster and more comfortable connection between the remote urban districts. The price in February 2010 of a one-way single ride in the railbus was 1.50 UAH. On 15 June 2010, the route was cancelled as unprofitable.

===Air transport===

The beginnings of aviation in Lviv reach back to 1884 when the Aeronautic Society was opened there. The society issued its own magazine &quot;Astronauta&quot; but soon ceased to exist. In 1909 on the initiative of Edmund Libanski the Awiata Society was founded. Among its members there was a group of professors and students of the Lviv Polytechnic, including Stefan Drzewiecki and Zygmunt Sochacki. Awiata was the oldest Polish organization of this kind and it concentrated its activities mainly on exhibitions such as the &quot;First Aviation Exhibition&quot; which took place in 1910 and featured models of aircraft built by Lviv students.

In 1913–1914 brothers Tadeusz and Władysław Floriańscy built a two-seater aeroplane. When World War I broke out Austrian authorities confiscated it but did not manage to evacuate the plane in time and it was seized by the Russians who used the plane for intelligence purposes. The Floriański brothers&#x27; plane was the first Polish-made aircraft. On 5 November 1918, a crew consisting of Stefan Bastyr and Janusz de Beaurain carried out the first-ever flight under the Polish flag taking off from Lviv&#x27;s Lewandówka (now ) airport. In the interbellum period Lwów was a major centre of gliding with a notable &quot;Gliding School&quot; in Bezmiechowa which opened in 1932. In the same year the Institute of Gliding Technology was opened in Lwów and was the second such institute in the world. In 1938 the &quot;First Polish Aircraft Exhibition&quot; took place in the city.

The interwar Lwów was also a major centre of the Polish Air Force with the Sixth Air Regiment located there. The Regiment was based at the Lwów airport opened in 1924 in the suburb of Skniłów (today ). The airport is located from the city centre. In 2012, after renovation, Lviv Airport got a new official name Lviv Danylo Halytskyi International Airport (LWO). A new terminal and other improvements worth under a $200 million has been done in preparation for the 2012 UEFA European Football Championship. The connection from Airport to the city centre is maintained by bus No. 48 and No. 9.

===Bicycle lanes===

Cycling is a new but growing mode of transport in Lviv. In 2011 the City of Lviv ratified an ambitious 9-year program for the set-up of cycling infrastructure – until the year 2019 an overall length of cycle lanes and tracks shall be realized. A working group formally organised within the City Council, bringing together representatives of the city administration, members of planning and design institutes, local NGOs and other stakeholders. Events like the All-Ukrainian Bikeday or the European Mobility Week show the popularity of cycling among Lviv&#x27;s citizens.

By September 2011, of new cycling infrastructure had been built. It can be expected that until the end of 2011 will be ready for use. The cycling advisor in Lviv – the first such position in Ukraine – is supervising and pushing forward the execution of the cycling plan and coordinates with various people in the city. The development of cycling in Ukraine is currently hampered by outdated planning norms and the fact, that most planners didn&#x27;t yet plan and experience cycling infrastructure. The update of national legislation and training for planners is therefore necessary.

In 2015, the first stations have been set up for a new bike-sharing system Nextbike – the first of its kind in Ukraine. New bike lanes are also under construction, making Lviv the most bike-friendly city in the country. The City Council plans to build an entire cycling infrastructure by 2020, with cycle lanes () and street bike hire services.

<doc id="49972" wikidata="Q194267" url="?curid=49972" title="Rosicrucianism">
<text>Rosicrucianism () is a spiritual and cultural movement that arose in early modern Europe in the early 17th century after the publication of several texts announcing to the world a new esoteric order. Rosicrucianism is symbolized by the Rose Cross or Rosy Cross. There have been several Rosicrucian (or Rosicrucian-inspired) organizations since the initial movement was founded, including the Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross (1750s–1790s), the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia (1865–present), and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (1887–1903).

== History ==
Between 1610 and 1615, two anonymous manifestos appeared in early modern Germany and soon after were published throughout Europe. The &quot;Fama Fraternitatis Rosae Crucis&quot; (The Fame of the Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross) was circulated in manuscript among German occultists since about 1610, and published at Cassel in 1614. Johannes Valentinus Andreae has been considered the possible author of the work. A literal reading narrates the travels and education of &quot;Father Brother C.R.C.&quot; and his founding of a secret brotherhood of similarly prepared men. Names, numbers, and other details have Qabalistic allusions, in which the cognoscenti of that era were well-versed. The &quot;Confessio Fraternitatis&quot; (The Confession of the Brotherhood of RC), published in Frankfurt in 1615, responded to confusions and criticisms and elaborated the matter further.
Many were attracted to the promise of a &quot;universal reformation of mankind&quot; through a science &quot;built on esoteric truths of the ancient past&quot;, which, &quot;concealed from the average man, provide insight into nature, the physical universe, and the spiritual realm&quot;, which they say had been kept secret for decades until the intellectual climate was ready to receive it. The manifestos elaborate these matters extensively but cryptically in terms of Qabalah, Hermeticism, alchemy, and Christian mysticism, subjects whose methods, symbolism, and allusions were ardently studied by many intellectuals of the period.

In 1617 a third anonymous volume was published, the &quot;Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz&quot;. In his posthumously published autobiography, Johann Valentine Andreae acknowledged its origin in a romantic fantasy that he wrote before he was 16 years old (1602), among other likewise forgotten juvenilia, and which he elaborated in response to the &quot;Fame&quot; and &quot;Confession&quot;, and said of it that &quot;the Chymical Wedding, with its fertile brood of monsters, a &quot;ludibrium&quot; which surprisingly some esteem and explicate with subtle investigations, is plainly futile and betrays the vanity of the curious&quot; (&quot;Nuptiae Chymicae, cum monstrorum foecundo foetu, ludibriu, quod mireris a nonullis aestimatum et subtili indagine explicatum, plane futile et quod inanitatem curiosorum prodat&quot;). He called Rosicrucianism a &quot;ludibrium&quot; (a lampoon or parody) during his lifetime, in writings advocating social and religious reform through a sectarian Christian organization of his design. Some scholars of esotericism suggest that Andreae disowned Rosicrucianism to shield his clerical career from the wrath of the religious and political institutions of the day. &quot;[I]t is clear from his &quot;&quot;Turris Babel&quot;, &quot;Mythologia Christiana&quot;&quot;, and other works, that he considered the manifestos a reprehensible hoax.&quot; This augmented controversies as to whether they were a hoax, whether the &quot;Order of the Rosy Cross&quot; existed as described in the manifestos, or whether the whole thing was a metaphor disguising a movement that really existed, but in a different form.

The promise of a spiritual transformation at a time of great turmoil, the manifestos influenced many figures to seek esoteric knowledge. Seventeenth-century occult philosophers such as Michael Maier, Robert Fludd, and Thomas Vaughan interested themselves in the Rosicrucian worldview. In his work &quot;Silentium Post Clamores&quot; (1617), Michael Maier described Rosicrucianism as having arisen from a &quot;primordial tradition&quot;, saying &quot;Our origins are Egyptian, Brahminic, derived from the mysteries of Eleusis and Samothrace, the Magi of Persia, the Pythagoreans, and the Arabs&quot;.

In later centuries, many esoteric societies claimed to derive from the original Rosicrucians. The most influential of these societies was the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, which derived from Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia and counted many prominent figures among its members. The largest is the Rosicrucian Order, AMORC, a multinational organization based in Rosicrucian Park, San Jose, California, US. Paul Foster Case, founder of the Builders of the Adytum as a successor to the Golden Dawn, published &quot;The true and invisible Rosicrucian Order&quot;, elaborating the Qabalistic basis and interpretation of the &quot;Fame&quot; and &quot;Confession&quot;.

== Rosicrucian manifestos ==
=== Origins ===

Between 1614 and 1617, three anonymous manifestos were published, first in Germany and soon after throughout Europe: the &quot;Fama Fraternitatis RC&quot; (&quot;The Fame of the Brotherhood of RC&quot;, 1614), the &quot;Confessio Fraternitatis&quot; (&quot;The Confession of the Brotherhood of RC&quot;, 1615), and the &quot;Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosicross anno 1459&quot; (1617).

The &quot;Fama Fraternitatis&quot; presents the legend of a German doctor and mystic philosopher referred to as &quot;Father Brother C.R.C.&quot; (later identified in a third manifesto as Christian Rosenkreuz, or &quot;Rose-cross&quot;). The year 1378 is presented as being the birth year of &quot;our Christian Father,&quot; and it is stated that he lived 106 years. It is said that he studied in the Middle East under various masters – a story implying a possible link to Islamic mysticism or Sufism, which influenced a number of Western esoteric traditions.

During the lifetime of C.R.C., the order was said to comprise no more than eight members, each a doctor and &quot;all bachelors of vowed virginity.&quot; Each member undertook an oath to heal the sick without accepting payment, to maintain a secret fellowship, and to find a replacement for himself before he died. Three such generations had supposedly passed between c. 1500 and c. 1600: a time when scientific, philosophical, and religious freedom had grown so that the public might benefit from the Rosicrucians&#x27; knowledge, so that they were now seeking good men.
=== Reception ===
The manifestos were, and continue to be, not taken literally by many but rather regarded either as hoaxes or as allegorical statements. They state: &quot;We speak unto you by parables, but would willingly bring you to the right, simple, easy, and ingenuous exposition, understanding, declaration, and knowledge of all secrets.&quot;

The first Rosicrucian manifesto was influenced by the work of the respected hermetic philosopher Heinrich Khunrath, of Hamburg, author of the &quot;Amphitheatrum Sapientiae Aeternae&quot; (1609), who was in turn influenced by John Dee, author of the &quot;Monas Hieroglyphica&quot; (1564). The invitation to the royal wedding in the &quot;Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz&quot; opens with Dee&#x27;s philosophical key, the &quot;Monas Hieroglyphica&quot; symbol. The writer also claimed the brotherhood possessed a book that resembled the works of Paracelsus. Adam Haslmayr a friend of Karl Widemann wrote him a letter about Rosicrucian people who revealed the Theophrastiam 24 December 1611.

In his autobiography, Johann Valentin Andreae (1586–1654) claimed that the anonymously published &quot;Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz&quot; was one of his works, and he subsequently described it as a &quot;ludibrium&quot;. In his later works, he makes alchemy an object of ridicule and places it along with music, art, theater, and astrology in the category of less serious sciences. According to some sources, his role in the origin of the Rosicrucian legend is controversial. But according to others, it was generally accepted.

== Rosicrucian Enlightenment ==

In the early 17th century, the manifestos caused excitement throughout Europe by declaring the existence of a secret brotherhood of alchemists and sages who were preparing to transform the arts and sciences, and religious, political, and intellectual landscapes of Europe. Wars of politics and religion ravaged the continent. The works were re-issued several times, followed by numerous pamphlets, favorable or otherwise. Between 1614 and 1620, about 400 manuscripts and books were published which discussed the Rosicrucian documents.

The peak of the &quot;Rosicrucianism furore&quot; was reached when two mysterious posters appeared on the walls of Paris in 1622 within a few days of each other. The first said &quot;We, the Deputies of the Higher College of the Rose-Croix, do make our stay, visibly and invisibly, in this city (...)&quot;, and the second ended with the words &quot;The thoughts attached to the real desire of the seeker will lead us to him and him to us.&quot;

The legendary first manifesto, &quot;Fama Fraternitatis Rosae Crucis&quot; (1614), inspired the works of Michael Maier (1568–1622) of Germany; Robert Fludd (1574–1637) and Elias Ashmole (1617–1692) of England; Teophilus Schweighardt Constantiens, Gotthardus Arthusius, Julius Sperber, Henricus Madathanus, Gabriel Naudé, Thomas Vaughan and others. Rosicrucianism was associated with Protestantism (Lutheranism in particular).

In Elias Ashmole&#x27;s &quot;Theatrum Chimicum britannicum&quot; (1650) he defends the Rosicrucians. Some later works impacting Rosicrucianism were the &quot;Opus magocabalisticum et theosophicum&quot; by George von Welling (1719)of alchemical and paracelsian inspirationand the &quot;Aureum Vellus oder Goldenes Vliess&quot; by Hermann Fictuld in 1749.

Michael Maier was appointed &quot;Pfalzgraf&quot; (Count Palatine) by Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, King of Hungary and King of Bohemia. He also was one of the most prominent defenders of the Rosicrucians, clearly transmitting details about the &quot;Brothers of the Rose Cross&quot; in his writings. Maier made the firm statement that the Brothers of R.C. existed to advance inspired arts and sciences, including alchemy. Researchers of Maier&#x27;s writings point out that he never claimed to have produced gold, nor did Heinrich Khunrath or any of the other &quot;Rosicrucianists&quot;. Their writings point toward a symbolic and spiritual alchemy, rather than an operative one. In a combination of direct and veiled styles, these writings conveyed the nine stages of the involutive-evolutive transmutation of the &quot;threefold body&quot; of the human being, the &quot;threefold soul&quot; and the &quot;threefold spirit&quot;, among other esoteric knowledge related to the &quot;Path of Initiation&quot;.

In his 1618 pamphlet, &quot;Pia et Utilissima Admonitio de Fratribus Rosae Crucis&quot;, Henrichus Neuhusius wrote that the Rosicrucians departed for the east due to European instability caused by the start of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. In 1710, Sigmund Richter, founder of the secret society of the Golden and Rosy Cross, also suggested the Rosicrucians had migrated eastward. In the first half of the 20th century, René Guénon, a researcher of the occult, presented this same idea in some of his works. Arthur Edward Waite, an eminent author of the 19th century, presented arguments contradicting this idea. It was in this fertile field of discourse that many Rosicrucian societies arose. They were based on the occult, inspired by the mystery of this &quot;College of Invisibles&quot;.

Some modern scholars, for example Adam McLean and Giordano Berti, assume that among the first followers of the Rose Cross there was also the German theologian Daniel Cramer, who in 1617 published a treatise entitled &quot;Societas Jesus et Rosae Crucis Vera&quot; (The True Society of Jesus and the Rosy Cross), containing 40 emblematic figures accompanied by biblical quotations.
The literary works of the 16th and 17th centuries were full of enigmatic passages containing references to the Rose Cross, as in the following (somewhat modernized):

The idea of such an order, exemplified by the network of astronomers, professors, mathematicians, and natural philosophers in 16th-century Europe promoted by such men as Johannes Kepler, Georg Joachim Rheticus, John Dee and Tycho Brahe, gave rise to the Invisible College. This was the precursor to the Royal Society founded in 1660. It was constituted by a group of scientists who began to hold regular meetings to share and develop knowledge acquired by experimental investigation. Among these were Robert Boyle, who wrote: &quot;the cornerstones of the Invisible (or as they term themselves the Philosophical) College, do now and then honour me with their company...&quot;;

John Wilkins and John Wallis, who described those meetings in the following terms: &quot;About the year 1645, while I lived in London (at a time when, by our civil wars, academical studies were much interrupted in both our Universities), ... I had the opportunity of being acquainted with divers worthy persons, inquisitive of natural philosophy, and other parts of human learning; and particularly of what hath been called the New Philosophy or Experimental Philosophy. We did by agreements, divers of us, meet weekly in London on a certain day and hour, under a certain penalty, and a weekly contribution for the charge of experiments, with certain rules agreed amongst us, to treat and discourse of such affairs...&quot;

== Legacy in esoteric orders ==

=== Rose-Cross Degrees in Freemasonry ===
According to Jean Pierre Bayard, two Rosicrucian-inspired Masonic rites emerged toward the end of 18th century, the Rectified Scottish Rite, widespread in Central Europe where there was a strong presence of the &quot;Golden and Rosy Cross&quot;, and the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, first practiced in France, in which the 18th degree is called &quot;Knight of the Rose Croix&quot;.

The change from &quot;operative&quot; to &quot;speculative&quot; Masonry occurred between the end of the 16th and the beginning of the 18th century. Two of the earliest speculative Masons for whom a record of initiation exists were Sir Robert Moray and Elias Ashmole. Robert Vanloo states that earlier 17th century Rosicrucianism had a considerable influence on Anglo-Saxon Masonry. Hans Schick sees in the works of Comenius (1592–1670) the ideal of the newly born English Masonry before the foundation of the Grand Lodge in 1717. Comenius was in England during 1641.

The Gold und Rosenkreuzer (Golden and Rosy Cross) was founded by the alchemist Samuel Richter who in 1710 published &quot;Die warhhaffte und vollkommene Bereitung des Philosophischen Steins der Brüderschaft aus dem Orden des Gülden-und Rosen-Creutzes&quot; (&quot;The True and Complete Preparation of the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone by the Brotherhood from the Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross&quot;) in Breslau under the pseudonym Sincerus Renatus in Prague in the early 18th century as a hierarchical secret society composed of internal circles, recognition signs and alchemy treatises. Under the leadership of Hermann Fictuld the group reformed itself extensively in 1767 and again in 1777 because of political pressure. Its members claimed that the leaders of the Rosicrucian Order had invented Freemasonry and only they knew the secret meaning of Masonic symbols. The Rosicrucian Order had been founded by Egyptian &quot;Ormusse&quot; or &quot;Licht-Weise&quot; who had emigrated to Scotland with the name &quot;Builders from the East&quot;. In 1785 and 1788 the Golden and Rosy Cross group published the &quot;Geheime Figuren&quot; or &quot;The Secret Symbols of the 16th and 17th century Rosicrucians&quot;.

Led by Johann Christoph von Wöllner and General Johann Rudolf von Bischoffwerder, the Masonic lodge (later: &quot;Grand Lodge&quot;) &quot;Zu den drei Weltkugeln&quot; (&quot;The Three Globes&quot;) was infiltrated and came under the influence of the Golden and Rosy Cross. Many Freemasons became Rosicrucianists and Rosicrucianism was established in many lodges. In 1782 at the Convent of Wilhelmsbad the &quot;Alte schottische Loge Friedrich zum goldenen Löwen&quot; (&quot;Old Scottish Lodge Friedrich at the Golden Lion&quot;) in Berlin strongly requested Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and all other Freemasons to submit to the Golden and Rosy Cross, without success.

After 1782, this highly secretive society added Egyptian, Greek, and Druidic mysteries to its alchemy system. A comparative study of what is known about the Gold and Rosenkreuzer appears to reveal, on the one hand, that it has influenced the creation of some modern initiatory groups and, on the other hand, that the Nazis (see &quot;The Occult Roots of Nazism&quot;) may have been inspired by this German group.

According to the writings of the Masonic historian E.J. Marconis de Negre, who together with his father Gabriel M. Marconis is held to be the founder of the &quot;Rite of Memphis-Misraim&quot; of Freemasonry, based on earlier conjectures (1784) by a Rosicrucian scholar Baron de Westerode and also promulgated by the 18th century secret society called the &quot;Golden and Rosy Cross&quot;, the Rosicrucian Order was created in the year 46 when an Alexandrian Gnostic sage named Ormus and his six followers were converted by one of Jesus&#x27; disciples, Mark. Their symbol was said to be a red cross surmounted by a rose, thus the designation of Rosy Cross. From this conversion, Rosicrucianism was supposedly born, by purifying Egyptian mysteries with the new higher teachings of early Christianity.

Another notable figure for both egyptian freemasonry and rosicrucianism in Italy was Giustiniano Lebano who held high offices in the Memphis Misraim rite and was an influential figure in the later esoteric developments of the peninsula, including influencing Giuliano Kremmerz and the members of the UR Group.
The Neapolitan branch of the Memphis-Misraim rite, Grande Oriente Egizio, isntructed Giuliano Kremmerz to create the Brotherhood of Myriam with the aim of practising therapeutic magic for those affected by disease, including non-initiates.

According to Maurice Magre (1877–1941) in his book &quot;Magicians, Seers, and Mystics&quot;, Rosenkreutz was the last descendant of the Germelshausen, a German family from the 13th century. Their castle stood in the Thuringian Forest on the border of Hesse, and they embraced Albigensian doctrines. The whole family was put to death by Landgrave Conrad of Thuringia, except for the youngest son, who was then five years old. He was carried away secretly by a monk, an Albigensian adept from Languedoc, and placed in a monastery under the influence of the Albigenses, where he was educated and met the four Brothers later to be associated with him in the founding of the Rosicrucian Brotherhood. Magre&#x27;s account supposedly derives from oral tradition.

Around 1530, more than eighty years before the publication of the first manifesto, the association of cross and rose already existed in Portugal in the Convent of the Order of Christ, home of the Knights Templar, later renamed Order of Christ. Three &quot;bocetes&quot; were, and still are, on the &quot;abóboda&quot; (vault) of the initiation room. The rose can clearly be seen at the center of the cross. At the same time, a minor writing by Paracelsus called &quot;Prognosticatio Eximii Doctoris Paracelsi&quot; (1530), containing 32 prophecies with allegorical pictures surrounded by enigmatic texts, makes reference to an image of a double cross over an open rose; this is one of the examples used to prove the &quot;Fraternity of the Rose Cross&quot; existed far earlier than 1614.

== Modern groups ==

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, various groups styled themselves Rosicrucian. The diverse groups who link themselves to a &quot;Rosicrucian Tradition&quot; can be divided into three categories: Esoteric Christian Rosicrucian groups, which profess Christ; Masonic Rosicrucian groups such as &quot;SRIA&quot;, &quot;Societas Rosicruciana&quot;; and initiatory groups such as the Golden Dawn and the Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC).

Esoteric Christian Rosicrucian schools provide esoteric knowledge related to the inner teachings of Christianity.

The Rosicrucian Fellowship, 1909 at Mount Ecclesia (groundbreaking for first building: 1911). Teachings present the &#x27;mysteries&#x27;, in the form of esoteric knowledge, of which Christ spoke in Matthew 13:11 and Luke 8:10. The Fellowship seeks to prepare the individual through harmonious development of mind and heart in a spirit of unselfish service to mankind and an all-embracing altruism. According to it the Rosicrucian Order was founded in 1313 and is composed of twelve exalted Beings gathered around a thirteenth, Christian Rosenkreuz. These great adepts have already advanced far beyond the cycle of rebirth. Their mission is to prepare the &#x27;whole wide world&#x27; for a new phase in religion, which includes awareness of the inner worlds and the subtle bodies, and to provide safe guidance in the gradual awakening of man&#x27;s latent spiritual faculties during the next six centuries toward the coming Age of Aquarius.

Several Russians of a mystical mind took advantage of the Edict of Toleration of religion in 1905 to form or resurrect what they considered the ancient forms of esoteric Orders. These were the new Rosicrucians. Their inspired mentors compiled volumes of mystic philosophy which they combined with their personal notions of what the ancient Orders were, and so formed groups. The three principal neo-Rosicrucian Orders of early Soviet Russia were Emesh Redivivus, the Orionist-Manicheans, and the Lux Astralis. Due to suppression by the Soviets they had disbanded by 1933.

According to Masonic writers, the Order of the Rose Cross is expounded in a major Christian literary work that molded the subsequent spiritual beliefs of western civilization: &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; (ca. 1308–1321) by Dante Alighieri.

Other Christian-oriented Rosicrucian bodies include:

* Lectorium Rosicrucianum, 1924
* Archeosophical Society, 1968

Freemasonic Rosicrucian bodies providing preparation either through direct study and/or through the practice of a symbolic initiatory journey.
* Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, 1801
* Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia, 1866
*Societas Rosicruciana in Canadiensis, 1876

Initiatory groups which follow a degree system of study and initiation include:
* The Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC), incorporated in the U.S. in 1915

=== Related groups ===
Many of these groups generally speak of a linear descent from earlier branches of the ancient Rosicrucian Order in England, France, Egypt, or other countries. However, some groups speak of a spiritual affiliation with a true and invisible Rosicrucian Order. Note that there are other Rosicrucian groups not listed here. Some do not use the name &quot;Rosicrucian&quot; to name themselves. Some groups listed have been dissolved or are no longer operating.

<text>The mineral or gemstone chrysoberyl is an aluminate of beryllium with the formula BeAl2O4. The name chrysoberyl is derived from the Greek words χρυσός &quot;chrysos&quot; and βήρυλλος &quot;beryllos&quot;, meaning &quot;a gold-white spar&quot;. Despite the similarity of their names, chrysoberyl and beryl are two completely different gemstones, although they both contain beryllium. Chrysoberyl is the third-hardest frequently encountered natural gemstone and lies at 8.5 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness, between corundum (9) and topaz (8).

An interesting feature of its crystals are the cyclic twins called &quot;trillings&quot;. These twinned crystals have a hexagonal appearance, but are the result of a triplet of twins with each &quot;twin&quot; oriented at 120° to its neighbors and taking up 120° of the cyclic trilling. If only two of the three possible twin orientations are present, a V-shaped twin results.

Ordinary chrysoberyl is yellowish-green and transparent to translucent. When the mineral exhibits good pale green to yellow color and is transparent, then it is used as a gemstone. The three main varieties of chrysoberyl are: ordinary yellow-to-green chrysoberyl, cat&#x27;s eye or cymophane, and alexandrite. Yellow-green chrysoberyl was referred to as &quot;chrysolite&quot; during the Victorian and Edwardian eras, which caused confusion since that name has also been used for the mineral olivine (&quot;peridot&quot; as a gemstone); that name is no longer used in the gemological nomenclature.

Alexandrite, a strongly pleochroic (trichroic) gem, will exhibit emerald green, red and orange-yellow colors depending on viewing direction in partially polarised light. However, its most distinctive property is that it also changes color in artificial (tungsten/halogen) light compared to daylight. The color change from red to green is due to strong absorption of light in a narrow yellow portion of the spectrum, while allowing large bands of more blue-green and red wavelengths to be transmitted. Which of these prevails to give the perceived hue depends on the spectral balance of the illumination. Fine-quality alexandrite has a green to bluish-green color in daylight (relatively blue illumination of high color temperature), changing to a red to purplish-red color in incandescent light (relatively yellow illumination). However, fine-color material is extremely rare. Less-desirable stones may have daylight colors of yellowish-green and incandescent colors of brownish red.

Cymophane is popularly known as &quot;cat&#x27;s eye&quot;. This variety exhibits pleasing chatoyancy or opalescence that reminds one of the eye of a cat. When cut to produce a cabochon, the mineral forms a light-green specimen with a silky band of light extending across the surface of the stone.

==Occurrence==

Chrysoberyl forms as a result of pegmatitic processes. Melting in the Earth&#x27;s crust produces relatively low-density molten magma which can rise upwards towards the surface. As the main magma body cools, water originally present in low concentrations became more concentrated in the molten rock because it could not be incorporated into the crystallization of solid minerals. The remnant magma thus becomes richer in water, and also in rare elements that similarly do not fit in the crystal structures of major rock-forming minerals. The water extends the temperature range downwards before the magma becomes completely solid, allowing concentration of rare elements to proceed so far that they produce their own distinctive minerals. The resulting rock is igneous in appearance but formed at a low temperature from a water-rich melt, with large crystals of the common minerals such as quartz and feldspar, but also with elevated concentrations of rare elements such as beryllium, lithium, or niobium, often forming their own minerals; this is called a pegmatite. The high water content of the magma made it possible for the crystals to grow quickly, so pegmatite crystals are often quite large, which increases the likelihood of gem specimens forming.

Chrysoberyl can also grow in the country rocks near to pegmatites, when Be- and Al-rich fluids from the pegmatite react with surrounding minerals. Hence, it can be found in mica schists and in contact with metamorphic deposits of dolomitic marble. Because it is a hard, dense mineral that is resistant to chemical alteration, it can be weathered out of rocks and deposited in river sands and gravels in alluvial deposits with other gem minerals such as diamond, corundum, topaz, spinel, garnet, and tourmaline. When found in such placers, it will have rounded edges instead of sharp, wedge-shape forms. Much of the chrysoberyl mined in Brazil and Sri Lanka is recovered from placers, as the host rocks have been intensely weathered and eroded.

If the pegmatite fluid is rich in beryllium, crystals of beryl or chrysoberyl could form. Beryl has a high ratio of beryllium to aluminium, while the opposite is true for chrysoberyl. Both are stable with the common mineral quartz. For alexandrite to form, some chromium would also have had to be present. However, beryllium and chromium do not tend to occur in the same types of rock. Chromium is most common in mafic and ultramafic rocks in which beryllium is extremely rare. Beryllium becomes concentrated in felsic pegmatites in which chromium is almost absent. Therefore, the only situation where an alexandrite can grow is when Be-rich pegmatitic fluids react with Cr-rich country rock. This unusual requirement explains the rarity of this chrysoberyl variety.

==Alexandrite==
The alexandrite variety displays a color change dependent upon the nature of ambient lighting. Alexandrite results from small scale replacement of aluminium by chromium ions in the crystal structure, which causes intense absorption of light over a narrow range of wavelengths in the yellow region (520–620 nm) of the visible light spectrum. Because human vision is most sensitive to green light and least sensitive to red light, alexandrite appears greenish in daylight where the full spectrum of visible light is present, and reddish in incandescent light which emits less green and blue light. This color change is independent of any change of hue with viewing direction through the crystal that would arise from pleochroism.

Alexandrite from the Ural Mountains in Russia can be green by daylight and red by incandescent light. Other varieties of alexandrite may be yellowish or pink in daylight and a columbine or raspberry red by incandescent light.

Stones that show a dramatic color change and strong colors (e.g., red-to-green) are rare and sought-after, but stones that show less distinct colors (e.g. yellowish green changing to brownish yellow) may also be considered &quot;alexandrite&quot; by gem labs such as the Gemological Institute of America.

According to a popular but controversial story, alexandrite was discovered by the Finnish mineralogist Nils Gustaf Nordenskiöld (1792–1866), and named alexandrite in honor of the future Emperor of All Russia Alexander II Romanov. Nordenskiöld&#x27;s initial discovery occurred as a result of an examination of a newly found mineral sample he had received from Perovskii, which he identified as emerald at first. The first emerald mine had been opened in 1831. However, recent research suggests that the stone was discovered by Yakov Kokovin.

Alexandrite and larger were traditionally thought to be found only in the Ural Mountains, but have since been found in larger sizes in Brazil. Other deposits are located in India (Andhra Pradesh), Madagascar, Tanzania and Sri Lanka. Alexandrite in sizes over three carats are very rare. Today, several labs can produce synthetic lab-grown stones with the same chemical and physical properties as natural alexandrite. Several methods can produce flux-grown alexandrite, Czochralski (or pulled) alexandrite, and hydrothermally-produced alexandrite. Flux-grown gems are fairly difficult to distinguish from natural alexandrite as they contain inclusions that seem natural. Czochralski or pulled alexandrite is easier to identify because it is very clean and contains curved striations visible under magnification. Although the color change in pulled stones can be from blue to red, the color change does not truly resemble that of natural alexandrite from any deposit. Hydrothermal lab-grown alexandrite has identical physical and chemical properties to real alexandrite.

Some gemstones falsely described as lab-grown synthetic alexandrite are actually corundum laced with trace elements (e.g., vanadium) or color-change spinel and are not actually chrysoberyl. As a result, they would be more accurately described as &quot;simulated alexandrite&quot; rather than &quot;synthetic&quot;. This alexandrite-like sapphire material has been around for almost 100 years and shows a characteristic purple-mauve colour change, which does not really look like alexandrite because there is never any green.

==Cymophane==

Translucent yellowish chatoyant chrysoberyl is called cymophane or cat&#x27;s eye. Cymophane has its derivation also from the Greek words meaning &#x27;wave&#x27; and &#x27;appearance&#x27;, in reference to the haziness that visually distorts what would normally be viewed as a well defined surface of a cabochon. This effect may be combined with a cat eye effect. In this variety, microscopic tubelike cavities or needle-like inclusions of rutile occur in an orientation parallel to the c-axis, producing a chatoyant effect visible as a single ray of light passing across the crystal. This effect is best seen in gemstones cut in cabochon forms perpendicular to the c-axis. The color in yellow chrysoberyl is due to Fe3+ impurities.

Although other minerals such as tourmaline, scapolite, corundum, spinel and quartz can form &quot;cat&#x27;s eye&quot; stones similar in appearance to cymophane, the jewelry industry designates these stones as &quot;quartz cat&#x27;s eyes&quot;, or &quot;ruby cat&#x27;s eyes&quot; and only chrysoberyl can be referred to as &quot;cat&#x27;s eye&quot; with no other designation.

Gems lacking the silky inclusions required to produce the cat&#x27;s eye effect are usually faceted. An alexandrite cat&#x27;s eye is a chrysoberyl cat&#x27;s eye that changes color. &quot;Milk and honey&quot; is a term commonly used to describe the color of the best cat&#x27;s eyes. The effect refers to the sharp milky ray of white light normally crossing the cabochon as a center line along its length and overlying the honey-colored background. The honey color is considered to be top-grade by many gemologists but the lemon yellow colors are also popular and attractive. Cat&#x27;s eye material is found as a small percentage of the overall chrysoberyl production wherever chrysoberyl is found.

Cat&#x27;s eye became significantly more popular by the end of the 19th century when the Duke of Connaught gave a ring with a cat&#x27;s eye as an engagement token; this was sufficient to make the stone more popular and increase its value greatly. Until that time, cat&#x27;s eye had predominantly been present in gem and mineral collections. The increased demand in turn created an intensified search for it in Sri Lanka.

<text>Old Possum&#x27;s Book of Practical Cats (1939) is a collection of whimsical light poems by T. S. Eliot about feline psychology and sociology, published by Faber and Faber. It serves as the basis for Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s 1981 musical &quot;Cats&quot;.

Eliot wrote the poems in the 1930s and included them, under his assumed name &quot;Old Possum&quot;, in letters to his godchildren. Eliot tried to persuade the poet Ralph Hodgson to illustrate the poems but failed.
They were collected and published in 1939, with cover illustrations by the author, and quickly re-published in 1940, illustrated in full by Nicolas Bentley. They have also been published in versions illustrated by Edward Gorey (1982), Axel Scheffler (2009) and Rebecca Ashdown (2014).

==Contents==

The contents of &quot;Old Possum&#x27;s Book of Practical Cats&quot;, along with the names of the featured cats where appropriate, are:
* &quot;The Naming of Cats&quot;
* &quot;The Old Gumbie Cat&quot; (Jennyanydots)
* &quot;Growltiger&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;
* &quot;The Rum Tum Tugger&quot;
* &quot;The Song of the Jellicles&quot;
* &quot;Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer&quot;
* &quot;Old Deuteronomy&quot;
* &quot;(Of) The Awefull Battle of the Pekes and the Pollicles (Together with Some Account of the Participation of the Pugs and the Poms and the Intervention of the Great Rumpus Cat)&quot;
* &quot;Mr. Mistoffelees&quot;
* &quot;Macavity: The Mystery Cat&quot;
* &quot;Bustopher Jones: The Cat about Town&quot;
* &quot;Skimbleshanks: The Railway Cat&quot;
* &quot;The Ad-dressing of Cats&quot;
* &quot;Cat Morgan Introduces Himself&quot; (added in the 1952 edition)

==Adaptations==

In 1954, English composer Alan Rawsthorne set six of the poems in a work for speaker and orchestra entitled &quot;Practical Cats&quot;, which was recorded soon afterwards, with the actor Robert Donat as the speaker. At about the same time another English composer, Humphrey Searle, composed another narrated piece based on the poems, using flute, piccolo, cello and guitar. This work, &quot;Two Practical Cats&quot;, consists of settings of the poems about Macavity and Growltiger.

The best-known musical adaptation of the poems is Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s musical &quot;Cats&quot;, which was premiered in the West End of London in 1981 and on Broadway in 1982. It became the longest-running Broadway show in history until it was overtaken by another musical by Lloyd Webber, &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;. As well as the characters found in the book, &quot;Cats&quot; introduces several additional characters from Eliot&#x27;s unpublished drafts, most notably Grizabella. The musical was adapted into a direct-to-video film in 1998. A feature film adaptation of &quot;Cats&quot; was released on 20 December 2019. As of December, 2019, the feature film&#x27;s production cost was $100 million but only grossed $38.3 million globally, yielding an approximate $70 million loss.

==Cultural references==
In the film &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot;, Logan and Jessica meet an old man in the ruins of the United States Senate Chamber during their search for Sanctuary. The Old Man has many cats and refers to the poem &quot;The Naming of Cats&quot;, explaining that each cat has three names: one common, one fancy and one that only the cat knows. Later the Old Man refers to one cat in particular, &quot;Gus&quot;, short for &quot;Asparagus&quot;, and goes on to recite parts of &quot;Macavity: the Mystery Cat&quot;.

The British rock band Mungo Jerry derived their name from the book&#x27;s poem &quot;Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer&quot;.

The Tombs, a bar and restaurant in Washington, D.C., is named after the fictional establishment mentioned in the poem &quot;Bustopher Jones: The Cat About Town&quot;.

==Comparable work==
On 5 June 2009, &quot;The Times&quot; revealed that in 1937 Eliot had composed a 34-line poem entitled &quot;Cows&quot; for the children of Frank Morley, a friend who, like Eliot, was a director of the publishing company Faber and Faber. Morley&#x27;s daughter, Susanna Smithson, uncovered the poem as part of the BBC Two programme &quot;Arena: T.S. Eliot&quot;, broadcast that night as part of the BBC Poetry Season.

<text>Francis I (; ; 12 September 1494 – 31 March 1547) was King of France from 1515 until his death in 1547. He was the son of Charles, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy. He succeeded his first cousin once removed and father-in-law Louis XII, who died without a legitimate son.

A prodigious patron of the arts, Francis promoted the emergent French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including Leonardo da Vinci, who brought the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, which Francis had acquired. Francis&#x27; reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of humanism and Protestantism, and the beginning of French exploration of the New World. Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire.

For his role in the development and promotion of the French language, Francis became known as (the &#x27;Father and Restorer of Letters&#x27;). He was also known as (&#x27;Francis of the Large Nose&#x27;), the , and the (the &#x27;Knight-King&#x27;).

In keeping with his predecessors, Francis continued the Italian Wars. The succession of his great rival Emperor Charles V to the Habsburg Netherlands and the throne of Spain, followed by his election as Holy Roman Emperor, led to France being geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. When this was unsuccessful, he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, a controversial move for a Christian king at the time.

==Early life and Accession==
Francis of Orléans was born on 12 September 1494 at the Château de Cognac in the town of Cognac, which at that time lay in the province of Saintonge, a part of the Duchy of Aquitaine. Today the town lies in the department of Charente.

Francis was the only son of Charles of Orléans, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy, and a great-great-grandson of King Charles V of France. His family was not expected to inherit the throne, as his third cousin King Charles VIII was still young at the time of his birth, as was his father&#x27;s cousin the Duke of Orléans, later King Louis XII. However, Charles VIII died childless in 1498 and was succeeded by Louis XII, who himself had no male heir. The Salic Law prevented women from inheriting the throne. Therefore, the four-year-old Francis (who was already Count of Angoulême after the death of his own father two years earlier) became the heir presumptive to the throne of France in 1498 and was vested with the title of Duke of Valois.

In 1505, Louis XII, having fallen ill, ordered his daughter Claude and Francis to be married immediately, but only through an assembly of nobles were the two engaged. Claude was heir presumptive to the Duchy of Brittany through her mother, Anne of Brittany. Following Anne&#x27;s death, the marriage took place on 18 May 1514. On 1 January 1515, Louis died, and Francis inherited the throne. He was crowned King of France in the Cathedral of Reims on 25 January 1515, with Claude as his queen consort.

==Reign==

As Francis was receiving his education, ideas emerging from the Italian Renaissance were influential in France. Some of his tutors, such as (his Latin instructor, who later during the reign of Francis was named ) and Christophe de Longueil (a Brabantian humanist), were attracted by these new ways of thinking and attempted to influence Francis. His academic education had been in arithmetic, geography, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing and he became proficient in Hebrew, Italian, Latin and Spanish. Francis came to learn chivalry, dancing, and music, and he loved archery, falconry, horseback riding, hunting, jousting, real tennis and wrestling. He ended up reading philosophy and theology and he was fascinated with art, literature, poetry and science. His mother, who admired Italian Renaissance art, passed this interest on to her son. Although Francis did not receive a humanist education, he was more influenced by humanism than any previous French king.

===Patron of the arts===
By the time he ascended the throne in 1515, the Renaissance had arrived in France, and Francis became an enthusiastic patron of the arts. At the time of his accession, the royal palaces of France were ornamented with only a scattering of great paintings, and not a single sculpture, not ancient nor modern.

Francis patronized many great artists of his time, including Andrea del Sarto and Leonardo da Vinci; the latter of whom was persuaded to make France his home during his last years. While da Vinci painted very little during his years in France, he brought with him many of his greatest works, including the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; (known in France as ), and these remained in France after his death. Other major artists to receive Francis&#x27; patronage included the goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini and the painters Rosso Fiorentino, Giulio Romano, and Primaticcio, all of whom were employed in decorating Francis&#x27; various palaces. He also invited architect Sebastiano Serlio, who enjoyed a fruitful late career in France. Francis also commissioned a number of agents in Italy to procure notable works of art and ship them to France.

===Man of letters===
Francis was also renowned as a man of letters. When he comes up in a conversation among characters in Baldassare Castiglione&#x27;s &quot;Book of the Courtier&quot;, it is as the great hope to bring culture to the war-obsessed French nation. Not only did Francis support a number of major writers of the period, but he was also a poet himself, if not one of particular ability. Francis worked diligently at improving the royal library. He appointed the French humanist Guillaume Budé as chief librarian and began to expand the collection. Francis employed agents in Italy to look for rare books and manuscripts, just as he had agents looking for artworks. During his reign, the size of the library greatly increased. Not only did he expand the library, but there is also evidence that he read the books he bought for it, a much rarer event in the royal annals. Francis set an important precedent by opening his library to scholars from around the world in order to facilitate the diffusion of knowledge.

In 1537, Francis signed the , which decreed that his library be given a copy of every book to be sold in France. Francis&#x27; older sister, Marguerite, Queen of Navarre, was an accomplished writer who produced the classic collection of short stories known as the &quot;Heptaméron&quot;. Francis corresponded with the abbess and philosopher Claude de Bectoz, of whose letters he was so fond that he would carry them around and show them to the ladies of his court. Together with his sister, he visited her in Tarascon.

===Construction===

Francis poured vast amounts of money into new structures. He continued the work of his predecessors on the and also started renovations on the . Early in his reign, he began construction of the magnificent , inspired by the architectural styles of the Italian Renaissance, and perhaps even designed by Leonardo da Vinci. Francis rebuilt the Louvre Palace, transforming it from a medieval fortress into a building of Renaissance splendour. He financed the building of a new City Hall (the ) for Paris in order to have control over the building&#x27;s design. He constructed the in the and rebuilt the . The largest of Francis&#x27; building projects was the reconstruction and expansion of the , which quickly became his favourite place of residence, as well as the residence of his official mistress, Anne, Duchess of Étampes.

===Military action===

Although the Italian Wars (1494–1559) came to dominate the reign of Francis I, which he constantly participated in at the forefront as le Roi-Chevalier, the wars were not the sole focus of his policies. He merely continued the wars that he succeeded from his predecessors and that his heir and successor on the throne, Henry II of France, would inherit after Francis&#x27; death. Indeed, the Italian Wars had begun when Milan sent a plea to King Charles VIII of France for protection against the aggressive actions of the King of Naples. 

Much of the military activity of Francis&#x27;s reign was focused on his sworn enemy, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Francis and Charles maintained an intense personal rivalry. In addition to the Holy Roman Empire, Charles personally ruled Spain, Austria, and a number of smaller possessions neighbouring France. He was thus a constant threat to Francis I&#x27;s kingdom.

Militarily and diplomatically, the reign of Francis I was a mixed bag of success and failure. Francis had tried and failed to become Holy Roman Emperor at the Imperial election of 1519, primarily due to his adversary Charles having threatened the electors with violence. However, there were also temporary victories, such as in the portion of the Italian Wars called the War of the League of Cambrai (1508–1516) and, more specifically, to the final stage of that war, which history refers to simply as &quot;Francis&#x27; First Italian War&quot; (1515–1516), when Francis routed the combined forces of the Papal States and the Old Swiss Confederacy at Marignano on 13–15 September 1515. This grand victory allowed Francis to capture the Italian city-state of Duchy of Milan. However, in November 1521, during the Four Years&#x27; War (1521–1526), Francis was forced to abandon Milan in the face of the advancing Imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire and open revolt within the duchy.

Francis I attempted to arrange an alliance with Henry VIII at the famous meeting at the Field of Cloth of Gold on 7 June 1520, but despite a lavish fortnight of diplomacy they failed to reach an agreement. Francis and Henry VIII both shared the dreams of power and chivalric glory; however their relationship featured intense personal and dynastic rivalry. Francis was driven by his intense eagerness to retake Milan, despite the strong opposition of other powers. Henry VIII was likewise determined to recapture northern France, which Francis could not allow.

However, the situation was grave; Francis had to face not only the whole might of Western Europe, but also internal hostility in the form of Charles III de Bourbon, a capable commander who fought alongside Francis as his constable at the great battle of Marignano, but defected to Charles V after his conflict with Francis&#x27; mother over inheritance of Bourbon estates. Despite all this, the Kingdom of France still held the balance of power in its favour. Nevertheless, the defeat suffered from the cataclysmic battle of Pavia on 24 February 1525, during part of the continuing Italian Wars known as the Four Years&#x27; War upheaved the political ground of Europe. He was actually taken prisoner: Cesare Hercolani injured his horse, and Francis himself was subsequently captured by Charles de Lannoy. Some claim he was captured by Diego Dávila, Alonso Pita da Veiga, and Juan de Urbieta, from Guipúzcoa. For this reason, Hercolani was named &quot;Victor of the battle of Pavia&quot;. was supposedly invented on the spot to feed the captive king after the battle.

Francis was held captive morbidly in Madrid. In a letter to his mother, he wrote, &quot;Of all things, nothing remains to me but honour and life, which is safe.&quot; This line has come down in history famously as &quot;All is lost save honour.&quot; Francis was compelled to make major concessions to Charles in the Treaty of Madrid (1526), signed on 14 January, before he was freed on 17 March. An ultimatum from Ottoman Sultan Suleiman to Charles additionally played a role in his release. Francis was forced to surrender any claims to Naples and Milan in Italy. He was forced to recognise the independence of the Duchy of Burgundy, which had been part of France since the death of Charles the Bold in 1477. And finally, Francis was betrothed to Charles&#x27; sister Eleanor. Francis returned to France in exchange for his two sons, Francis and Henry, Duke of Orléans, the future Henry II of France, but once he was free he revoked the forced concessions as his agreement with Charles was made under duress. He also proclaimed that the agreement was void because his sons were taken hostage with the implication that his word alone could not be trusted. Thus he firmly repudiated it. A renewed alliance with England enabled Francis to repudiate the treaty of Madrid.
Francis persevered in his rivalry against Charles and his intent to control Italy. By the mid-1520s, Pope Clement VII wished to liberate Italy from foreign domination, especially that of Charles, so he allied with Venice to form the League of Cognac. Francis joined the League in May 1526, in the War of the League of Cognac of 1526–30. Francis&#x27; allies proved weak, and the war was ended by the Treaty of Cambrai (1529; &quot;the Peace of the Ladies&quot;, negotiated by Francis&#x27; mother and Charles&#x27; aunt). The two princes were released, and Francis married Eleanor.

On 24 July 1534, Francis, inspired by the Spanish tercios and the Roman legions, issued an edict to form seven infantry Légions of 6,000 troops each, of which 12,000 of the 42,000 were to be arquebusiers, testifying to the growing importance of gunpowder. The force was a national standing army, where any soldier could be promoted on the basis of vacancies, was paid wages by grade and granted exemptions from the taille and other taxes up to 20 &quot;sous&quot;, a heavy burden on the state budget.

After the League of Cognac failed, Francis concluded a secret alliance with Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse on 27 January 1534. This was directed against Charles on the pretext of assisting the Duke of Württemberg to regain his traditional seat, from which Charles had removed him in 1519. Francis also obtained the help of the Ottoman Empire and after the death of Francesco II Sforza, ruler of Milan, renewed the contest in Italy in the Italian War of 1536–1538. This round of fighting, which had little result, was ended by the Truce of Nice. The agreement collapsed, however, which led to Francis&#x27; final attempt on Italy in the Italian War of 1542–1546. Francis I managed to hold off the forces of Charles and Henry VIII, with Charles being forced to sign the Treaty of Crépy because of his financial difficulties and conflicts with the Schmalkaldic League.

===Relations with the Americas and Asia===
Francis had been much aggrieved at the papal bull : in June 1481 Portuguese rule over Africa and the Indies was confirmed by Pope Sixtus IV. Thirteen years later, on 7 June 1494, Portugal and the Crown of Castille signed the Treaty of Tordesillas under which the newly discovered lands would be divided between the two signatories. All this prompted Francis to declare, &quot;The sun shines for me as it does for others. I would very much like to see the clause of Adam&#x27;s will by which I should be denied my share of the world.&quot;

In order to counterbalance the power of the Habsburg Empire under Charles V, especially its control of large parts of the New World through the Crown of Spain, Francis endeavoured to develop contacts with the New World and Asia. Fleets were sent to the Americas and the Far East, and close contacts were developed with the Ottoman Empire permitting the development of French Mediterranean trade as well as the establishment of a strategic military alliance.

The port city now known as Le Havre was founded in 1517 during the early years of Francis&#x27; reign. The construction of a new port was urgently needed in order to replace the ancient harbours of Honfleur and Harfleur, whose utility had decreased due to silting. Le Havre was originally named &quot;Franciscopolis&quot; after the king who founded it, but this name did not survive into later reigns.

====Americas====
In 1524, Francis assisted the citizens of Lyon in financing the expedition of Giovanni da Verrazzano to North America. On this expedition, Verrazzano visited the present site of New York City, naming it New Angoulême, and claimed Newfoundland for the French crown. Verrazzano&#x27;s letter to Francis of 8 July 1524 is known as the &quot;Cèllere Codex&quot;.

In 1531, Bertrand d&#x27;Ornesan tried to establish a French trading post at Pernambuco, Brazil.

In 1534, Francis sent Jacques Cartier to explore the St. Lawrence River in Quebec to find &quot;certain islands and lands where it is said there must be great quantities of gold and other riches&quot;. In 1541, Francis sent Jean-François de Roberval to settle Canada and to provide for the spread of &quot;the Holy Catholic faith.&quot;

====Asia====

French trade with East Asia was initiated during the reign of Francis I with the help of shipowner Jean Ango. In July 1527, a French Norman trading ship from the city of Rouen is recorded by the Portuguese João de Barros as having arrived in the Indian city of Diu. In 1529, Jean Parmentier, on board the and the , reached Sumatra. Upon its return, the expedition triggered the development of the Dieppe maps, influencing the work of Dieppe cartographers such as Jean Rotz.

====Ottoman Empire====
Under the reign of Francis I, France became the first country in Europe to establish formal relations with the Ottoman Empire and to set up instruction in the Arabic language under the guidance of Guillaume Postel at the .

In a watershed moment in European diplomacy, Francis came to an understanding with the Ottoman Empire that developed into a Franco-Ottoman alliance. The objective for Francis was to find an ally against the House of Habsburg. The pretext used by Francis was the protection of the Christians in Ottoman lands. The alliance has been called &quot;the first nonideological diplomatic alliance of its kind between a Christian and non-Christian empire&quot;. It did, however, cause quite a scandal in the Christian world and was designated &quot;the impious alliance&quot;, or &quot;the sacrilegious union of the [French] Lily and the [Ottoman] Crescent.&quot; Nevertheless, it endured for many years, since it served the objective interests of both parties. The two powers colluded against Charles V, and in 1543 they even combined for a joint naval assault in the siege of Nice.

In 1533, Francis I sent colonel Pierre de Piton as ambassador to Morocco, initiating official France-Morocco relations. In a letter to Francis I dated 13 August 1533, the Wattassid ruler of Fez, Ahmed ben Mohammed, welcomed French overtures and granted freedom of shipping and protection of French traders.

===Bureaucratic reform and language policy===
Francis took several steps to eradicate the monopoly of Latin as the language of knowledge. In 1530, he declared French the national language of the kingdom, and that same year opened the Collège des trois langues, or , following the recommendation of humanist Guillaume Budé. Students at the Collège could study Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic, then Arabic under Guillaume Postel beginning in 1539.

In 1539, in his castle in Villers-Cotterêts, Francis signed the important edict known as Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts, which, among other reforms, made French the administrative language of the kingdom as a replacement for Latin. This same edict required priests to register births, marriages, and deaths, and to establish a registry office in every parish. This initiated the first records of vital statistics with filiations available in Europe.

===Religious policies===
Divisions in Christianity in Western Europe during Francis&#x27; reign created lasting international rifts. Martin Luther&#x27;s preaching and writing sparked the Protestant Reformation, which spread through much of Europe, including France.

Initially, Francis was relatively tolerant of the new movement, despite burning several heretics at the Place Maubert in 1523. He was influenced by his beloved sister Marguerite de Navarre, who was genuinely attracted by Luther&#x27;s theology. Francis even considered it politically useful, as it caused many German princes to turn against his enemy Charles V.

Francis&#x27; attitude towards Protestantism changed for the worse following the &quot;Affair of the Placards&quot;, on the night of 17 October 1534, in which notices appeared on the streets of Paris and other major cities denouncing the Catholic mass. The most fervent Catholics were outraged by the notice&#x27;s allegations. Francis himself came to view the movement as a plot against him and began to persecute its followers. Protestants were jailed and executed. In some areas, whole villages were destroyed. In Paris, after 1540, Francis had heretics such as Étienne Dolet tortured and burned. Printing was censored and leading Protestant reformers such as John Calvin were forced into exile. The persecutions soon numbered thousands of dead and tens of thousands of homeless.

Persecutions against Protestants were codified in the Edict of Fontainebleau (1540) issued by Francis. Major acts of violence continued, as when Francis ordered the extirpation of one of the historical pre-Lutheran groups, the Waldensians, at the Massacre of Mérindol in 1545.

===Death===
Francis died at the on 31 March 1547, on his son and successor&#x27;s 28th birthday. It is said that &quot;he died complaining about the weight of a crown that he had first perceived as a gift from God&quot;. He was interred with his first wife, Claude, Duchess of Brittany, in Saint Denis Basilica. He was succeeded by his son, Henry II.

Francis&#x27; tomb and that of his wife and mother, along with the tombs of other French kings and members of the royal family, were desecrated on 20 October 1793 during the Reign of Terror at the height of the French Revolution.

===Image and reputation===
Francis I has a poor reputation in France—his 500th anniversary was little noted in 1994. Popular and scholarly historical memory ignores his building of so many chateaux, his art collection, and his patronage of scholars and artists. He is seen as a playboy who disgraced France by allowing himself to be defeated and taken prisoner at Pavia. The historian Jules Michelet set the negative image.

Francis&#x27; personal emblem was the salamander and his Latin motto was (&quot;I nourish [the good] and extinguish [the bad]&quot;). His long nose earned him the nickname (&#x27;Francis of the Big Nose&#x27;), and he was also colloquially known as the or . For his personal involvement in battles, he was known as (&#x27;the Knight-King&#x27;) or (&#x27;the Warrior-King&#x27;).

British historian Glenn Richardson considers Francis a success:
:He was a king who ruled as well as reigned. He knew the importance of war and a high international profile in staking his claim to be a great warrior-king of France. In battle, he was brave, if impetuous, which led equally to triumph and disaster. Domestically, Francis exercised the spirit and letter of the royal prerogative to its fullest extent. He bargained hard over taxation and other issues with interest groups, often by appearing not to bargain at all. He enhanced royal power and concentrated decision-making in a tight personal executive but used a wide range of offices, gifts and his own personal charisma to build up an elective personal affinity among the ranks of the nobility upon whom his reign depended ... Under Francis, the court of France was at the height of its prestige and international influence during the 16th century. Although opinion has varied considerably over the centuries since his death, his cultural legacy to France, to its Renaissance, was immense and ought to secure his reputation as among the greatest of its kings.

==Marriage and issue==
On 18 May 1514, Francis married his second cousin Claude, the daughter of King Louis XII and Duchess Anne of Brittany. The couple had seven children:
# Louise (19 August 1515 – 21 September 1518): died young; engaged to Charles I of Spain almost from birth until death.
# Charlotte (23 October 1516 – 8 September 1524): died young; engaged to Charles I of Spain from 1518 until death.
# Francis (28 February 1518 – 10 August 1536): succeeded his mother Claude as Duke of Brittany, but died aged 18, unmarried and childless.
# Henry II (31 March 1519 – 10 July 1559): succeeded his father Francis I as King of France and his brother Francis as Duke of Brittany. Married Catherine de&#x27; Medici and had issue.
# Madeleine (10 August 1520 – 2 July 1537): married James V of Scotland and had no issue.
# Charles (22 January 1522 – 9 September 1545): died unmarried and childless.
# Margaret (5 June 1523 – 14 September 1574): married Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy and had issue.

On 4 July 1530, Francis I married his second wife Eleanor of Austria, Queen (widow) of Portugal and the sister of Emperor Charles V. The couple had no children.

During his reign, Francis kept two official mistresses at court, and he was the first king to officially give the title of &quot;maîtresse-en-titre&quot; to his favorite mistress. The first was Françoise de Foix, Countess of Châteaubriant. In 1526, she was replaced by the blonde-haired, cultured Anne de Pisseleu d&#x27;Heilly, Duchess of Étampes, who, with the death of Queen Claude two years earlier, wielded far more political power at court than her predecessor had done. Another of his earlier mistresses was allegedly Mary Boleyn, mistress of King Henry VIII and sister of Henry&#x27;s future wife, Anne Boleyn.

With Jacquette de Lanssac he was reputed to have had the following illegitimate child:
* Louis de Saint-Gelais (1512/1513–1593) married first Jeanne de La Roche-Andry and then Gabrielle de Rochechouart with issue.

==Portrayals==
Francis was the subject of several portraits. A 1525–30 work by Jean Clouet is now housed at the Louvre in Paris. A portrait dated to 1532–33 by Joos van Cleve may have been commissioned either for the occasion of a meeting with Henry VIII of England or Francis&#x27; second marriage. The workshop of van Cleve produced copies of this work to be distributed to other courts.

The amorous exploits of Francis inspired the 1832 play by Fanny Kemble, &quot;Francis the First&quot;, and the 1832 play by Victor Hugo, (&quot;The King&#x27;s Amusement&quot;), which featured the jester Triboulet, the inspiration for the 1851 opera &quot;Rigoletto&quot; by Giuseppe Verdi. Francis was first played in the George Méliès short (1907) by an unknown actor, possibly Méliès. He has been since played by Claude Garry (1910), William Powell (1922), Aimé Simon-Girard (1937), Sacha Guitry (1937), Gérard Oury (1953), Jean Marais (1955), Pedro Armendáriz (1956), Claude Titre (1962), Bernard Pierre Donnadieu (1990), Timothy West (1998), Emmanuel Leconte (2007–2010), Alfonso Bassave (2015-2016) and Colm Meaney (2022).

<text>Yosemite Valley ( ; &quot;Yosemite&quot;, Miwok for &quot;killer&quot;) is a glacial valley in Yosemite National Park in the western Sierra Nevada mountains of Central California, United States. The valley is about long and deep, surrounded by high granite summits such as Half Dome and El Capitan, and densely forested with pines. The valley is drained by the Merced River, and a multitude of streams and waterfalls flow into it, including Tenaya, Illilouette, Yosemite and Bridalveil Creeks. Yosemite Falls is the highest waterfall in North America and is a big attraction, especially in the spring, when the water flow is at its peak. The valley is renowned for its natural environment and is regarded as the centerpiece of Yosemite National Park.

The valley is the main attraction in the park for the majority of visitors and a bustling hub of activity during tourist season in the summer months. Most visitors enter the valley from roads to the west and pass through the Tunnel View entrance. Visitor facilities are in the center of the valley. There are both hiking trail loops that stay within the valley and trailheads that lead to higher elevations.

==Descriptions==

Yosemite Valley is on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada mountains, east of San Francisco. It stretches for in a roughly east–west direction, with an average width of about .
Yosemite Valley represents only one percent of the park area, but it is where most visitors arrive and stay. More than half a dozen creeks tumble from hanging valleys at the top of granite cliffs that can rise above the valley floor, which itself is above sea level. These streams combine into the Merced River, which flows out from the western end of the valley, down the rest of its canyon to the San Joaquin Valley. The flat floor of Yosemite Valley holds both forest and large open meadows, which have views of the surrounding crests and waterfalls.

Below is a description of these features, looking first at the walls above, moving west to east as a visitor does when entering the valley, then visiting the waterfalls and other water features, returning east to west with the flow of water.

The first view of Yosemite Valley many visitors see is the Tunnel View. So many paintings were made from a viewpoint nearby that the National Park Service named that viewpoint Artist Point. The view from the lower (western) end of the Valley contains the great granite monolith El Capitan on the left, and Cathedral Rocks on the right with Bridalveil Fall. Just past this spot the Valley suddenly widens with the Cathedral Spires, then the pointed obelisk of Sentinel Rock to the south. Across the Valley on the northern side are the Three Brothers, rising one above the other like gables built on the same angle – the highest crest is Eagle Peak, with the two below known as the Middle and Lower Brothers.
To this point the Valley has been curving gently to the left (north). Now a grand curve back to the right begins, with Yosemite Falls on the north, followed by the Royal Arches, topped by North Dome. Opposite, to the south, is Glacier Point, above the Valley floor. At this point the Valley splits in two, one section slanting northeast, with the other curving from south to southeast. Between them, at the eastern end of the valley, is Half Dome, among the most prominent natural features in the Sierra Nevada. Above and to the northeast of Half Dome is Clouds Rest, at ; it is the highest point near Yosemite Valley.

== Water ==
Snow melting in the Sierra forms creeks and lakes. In the surrounding region, these creeks flow to the edge of the Valley to form cataracts and waterfalls.

A fan of creeks and forks of the Merced River take drainage from the Sierra crest and combine at Merced Lake. The Merced then flows down to the end of its canyon (Little Yosemite Valley), where it begins what is often called the &quot;Giant Staircase&quot;. The first drop is Nevada Fall, which drops , bouncing off the granite slope below it. Below is Vernal Fall, high, one of the most picturesque waterfalls in the Valley. The Merced then descends rapids to meet Illilouette Creek, which drops from the valley rim to form Illilouette Fall. They combine at the base of the gorges that contain each stream, and then flow around the Happy Isles to meet Tenaya Creek at the eastern end of Yosemite Valley proper.

Tenaya Creek flows southwest from Tenaya Lake and down Tenaya Canyon, finally flowing between Half Dome and North Dome before joining the Merced River. The following falls tumble from the Valley rim to join it at various points:

* Yosemite Falls Upper Yosemite Fall , the middle cascades , and Lower Yosemite Fall . (Yosemite Creek)
* Snow Creek Falls 
* Sentinel Falls 
* Ribbon Fall 
* Royal Arch Cascade 
* Lehamite Falls 
* Staircase Falls 
* Bridalveil Fall . (Bridalveil Creek)
* Nevada Fall 
* Silver Strand Falls 
* Vernal Fall 

== Natural Yosemite Valley ==
=== Geology ===
The features in Yosemite Valley are made of granitic rock emplaced as plutons miles deep during the late Cretaceous. Over time the Sierra Nevada was uplifted, exposing this rock to erosion at the surface.

The oldest of these granitic rocks, at 114 million years, occur along the Merced River Gorge west of the valley. The El Capitan pluton intruded the valley, forming most of the granitic rock that makes up much of the central part of the valley, including Cathedral Rocks, Three Brothers, and El Capitan. The youngest Yosemite Valley pluton is the 87-million-year-old Half Dome granodiorite, which makes up most of the rock at Glacier Point, the Royal Arches, and its namesake, Half Dome.

For the last 30 million years, glaciers have periodically filled much of the valley. The most current glaciation, the Wisconsinian was not, however, the most severe. Ice ages previous to the Wisconsinian were colder and lasted longer. Their glaciers were huge and covered nearly all the landmarks around Yosemite Valley except Half Dome, Eagle Peak, Sentinel Dome, and the top of El Capitan. Wisconsinian glaciers, however, only reached Bridalveil Fall in the valley. The glaciers widened the valley, but much of its width is in fact due to previous stream erosion and mass wasting along vertical joints in the valley&#x27;s walls.

After the retreat of many of these glaciers, a stand of Ancient Lake Yosemite developed. The valley floor owes its flatness to sediment deposited by these stands (the last glaciers in the valley were small and did not remove much old lake sediment). The last stand of Lake Yosemite was about long and was impounded by a terminal moraine near the base of El Capitan. It was later filled by sediment, becoming a swampy meadow.

The parallel Tenaya Canyon and Little Yosemite Canyon glaciers were, at their largest, deep where they flowed into the Yosemite Valley near the base of Half Dome. They also formed Clouds Rest behind Half Dome as an arête.

Near Glacier Point there are of mostly glacial sediment with at least six separate sequences of Lake Yosemite sediments. Here, huge and highly erosive pre-Wisconsinian glaciers excavated the bedrock valley floor, and much smaller Wisconsinian glaciers deposited glacial debris.

=== Ecology ===
The biological community on the floor of Yosemite Valley is a diverse one, with more than 400 species of grasses and wildflowers and thousands of species of insects having been identified there. At the most general level, the valley can be classified as a dry yellow pine forest with a number of large open meadows. Plant and animal species that make up a significant part of this natural community include:
* Trees – ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, sugar pine, white fir, incense-cedar, California black oak, interior live oak, coast Douglas-fir, California laurel, bigleaf maple, Scouler&#x27;s willow, Pacific dogwood, white alder, western balsam poplar
* Shrubs – whiteleaf manzanita, mountain misery, western azalea, American dogwood, buckbrush, deer brush, sierra gooseberry
* Wildflowers – Indian pink, soap plant, California poppy, miner&#x27;s lettuce, purple Chinese houses, purple milkweed, Pacific starflower, western buttercup, pineapple weed
* Mammals – California ground squirrel, western gray squirrel, chickaree, mule deer, American black bear, bobcat, coyote
* Birds – dark-eyed junco, mountain chickadee, black-headed grosbeak, white-headed woodpecker, Steller&#x27;s jay, American dipper, common raven
* Reptiles – Gilbert&#x27;s skink, northern alligator lizard, rattlesnake
* Amphibians – Sierra Nevada salamander

==Tourism==

Yosemite National Park had a record number of 5 million visitors in 2016. In 2020 visitation dropped to 2,268,313 visitors. A reservation system was implemented in 2020, which required a reservation in order to enter the park. The reservation system has been periodically lifted and reimplemented since 2021.

On July 24, 2018, several areas of the park, including the Valley, were closed due to wildfires in the area.

=== Hiking ===

Several trails lead out of the Valley, including
* The John Muir Trail – running to Mount Whitney
* The Mist Trail – with views of Vernal Fall and Nevada Fall
* The Four Mile Trail – leading to Glacier Point.
* The Yosemite Falls Trail – to the top of Yosemite Falls

===Climbing===
Yosemite is now a world rock climbing attraction. The massive &#x27;big walls&#x27; of granite have been climbed countless times since the 1950s and have pushed climbers&#x27; abilities to new heights. While climbers traditionally take several days to climb the monoliths, bivvying on the rock faces, modern climbing techniques help climbers ascend the cliffs in mere hours. Many climbers stay at Camp 4 before beginning big wall climbs, which became notable after World War II as &quot;a birthplace of rock climbing’s modern age&quot; and was introduced into the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.

Half Dome figures prominently on the reverse side of the California state quarter. Hiking to the top of Half Dome is one of the most popular hikes from the valley, and very crowded. The park now requires permits to use the trail, and in 2011 the permits sold out very quickly after becoming available. The park now uses a lottery system for hikers to apply for permits.

== History ==

=== Native Americans in Yosemite ===
Habitation of the Yosemite Valley proper can be traced to about 3,000 years ago when vegetation and game in the region was similar to that present today; the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada had acorns, deer, and salmon, while the eastern Sierra had pinyon nuts and obsidian.
The prehistory of the area is divided into three cultural phases on archaeological grounds: the &quot;Crane Flat&quot; phase, (1000 BCE to 500 CE) is marked by hunting with the atl atl and the use of grinding stones; the &quot;Tarmarack&quot; phase (500 to 1200 CE), marked by a shift to using smaller rock points, indicating development and use of the bow and arrow; and the &quot;Mariposa&quot; phase, from 1200 until European contact in the mid-19th century.

In the 19th century, it was inhabited by a Miwok band who called the Valley &quot;Ah-wah-nee&quot; and themselves the Ahwahnechee. 
This group had trading and family ties to Mono Lake Paiutes from the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada. They annually burned the vegetation on the Valley floor, which promoted the black oak and kept the meadows and forests open. This protected the supply of their principal food, acorns, and reduced the chance of ambush. At the time of first European contact, this band was led by Chief Tenaya (Teneiya), who was raised by his mother among the Mono Lake Paiutes.

=== The Mariposa Battalion and the first tourists ===
The first non-Native Americans to see Yosemite Valley were probably members of the 1833 Joseph Walker Party, which was the first to cross the Sierra Nevada from east to west. The first descriptions of Yosemite, however, came nearly 20 years later. The 1849 California Gold Rush led to conflicts between miners and Native Americans, and the state formed the volunteer Mariposa Battalion as a punitive expedition against the Native Americans living in the Yosemite area. In 1851, the Battalion was led by Major Jim Savage, whose trading post on the Merced River the Awaneechee had raided. This and other missions (the Mariposa Wars) resulted in Chief Teneiya and the Awaneechee spending months on a reservation in the San Joaquin Valley. The band returned the next year to the Valley but took refuge among the Mono Paiutes after further conflicts with miners. Most of the Awaneechee (along with Teneiya) were chased back to the Valley and killed by the Paiutes after violating hospitality by stealing horses.

While the members of that first expedition of the Mariposa Battalion had heard rumors of what could be found up the Merced River, none were prepared for what they saw March 27, 1851, from what is now called Old Inspiration Point (close to the better-visited Tunnel View). Dr. Lafayette Bunnell later wrote:

Camping that night on the Valley floor, the group agreed with the suggestion of Dr. Bunnell to call it &quot;Yo-sem-i-ty&quot;, mistakenly believing that was the native name. The term is from the Southern Sierra Miwok word Yohhe&#x27;meti, meaning &quot;they are killers,&quot; which referred to Savage and the Mariposa Battalion. . 
James Hutchings—who organized the first tourist party to the Valley in 1855—and artist Thomas Ayers generated much of the earliest publicity about Yosemite, creating articles and entire magazine issues about the Valley. Ayres&#x27; highly detailed angularly exaggerated artwork and his written accounts were distributed nationally and an art exhibition of his drawings was held in New York City.

Two of Hutchings&#x27; first group of tourists, Milton and Houston Mann, built the first toll route into the valley, with the development of the first hotels in the area and other trails quickly following. Many of the early pioneers in the valley of European descent, and a few Native Americans, are buried in Yosemite Cemetery.

=== Yosemite: The first park ===

The work of Ayres gave Easterners an appreciation for Yosemite Valley and started a movement to preserve it. Influential figures such as Galen Clark, clergyman Thomas Starr King and leading landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted were among those who urged Senator John Conness of California to try to preserve Yosemite.

President Abraham Lincoln signed a bill on June 30, 1864, granting Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias to the State of California &quot;for public use, resort and recreation,&quot; the two tracts &quot;shall be inalienable for all time&quot;. This was the first time in history that a federal government had set aside scenic lands simply to protect them and to allow for their enjoyment by all people.

Simply designating an area a park isn&#x27;t sufficient to protect it. California did not set up an administration for the park until 1866 when the state appointed Galen Clark as the park&#x27;s guardian. An 11-year struggle followed to resolve homesteading claims in the valley. The challenge of increasing tourism, with the need to first build stagecoach roads, then the Yosemite Valley Railroad, along with hotels and other facilities in and around the Valley was met during the rest of the 19th century. But much environmental damage was caused to the valley itself at that time. The problems that Yosemite Park had under state control was one of the factors in establishing Yellowstone National Park as the first completely national park in 1872.

Due to the difficulty of traveling there, early visitors to the valley came for several weeks to a couple of months, often as entire families with many possessions. Early hotels were therefore set up for extended stays and catered primarily to wealthy patrons who could spend extended periods away from home. One of these hotels—the Wawona Hotel, built in the 1880s—still operates.

After the Valley became a park, the surrounding territory was still subject to logging, mining, and grazing. John Muir publicized the damage to the subalpine meadows that surround the Valley and in 1890, the government created a national park that included a much larger territory—enclosing Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove.

===20th century===

As with Yellowstone, the new federal park was under U.S. Army jurisdiction until 1914. In 1906, the state ceded the Valley and Mariposa Grove to the federal government. The National Park Service, on its creation in 1916, took over Yosemite.

Yosemite Valley is listed as a National Historic District and as a California Historical Landmark. After the creation of the Park Service, many separate hotel owners held separate concession contracts. The Yosemite Park Company had built the Yosemite Lodge and Yosemite Village had its own group of merchants. Fire had destroyed a number of the original valley hotels and concession owners came and went until Park Service forced the two largest companies to merge in order that one single concession contract could be given. In 1925 the two family-run companies became the Yosemite Park and Curry Company and went on to build and run the Ahwahnee Hotel as the company headquarters for years, introducing a number of traditions, including the Bracebridge dinner.

Curry Village was the site from where villagers and visitors watched the Yosemite Firefall. This &quot;fall&quot; was large batches of red hot embers dropped from Glacier Point. The Park Service stopped this practice in 1969 as part of their long process of de-emphasizing artificial park attractions.

On July 6, 1996, a massive rock slide, weighing an estimated 60,000–80,000 tons, crashed into the valley from the east side of Glacier Point, traveling at over . Dust blanketed that part of the valley for days, and the wind speed in front of the slide is estimated to have been . One person was killed in the slide.

=== Merced River Plan ===
In 1987, Congress designated 122 miles of the Merced as a Wild and Scenic River. Yosemite National Park contains 81 of these miles, and the valley contains eight of those miles. This designation will &quot;... preserve the Merced River in free-flowing condition and to protect the water quality and the outstandingly remarkable values (ORVs) that make the river worthy of designation.&quot;

In March 2014, the park system released the &quot;Merced Wild and Scenic River Comprehensive Management Plan/EIS &quot;to address the preservation of the river, safety, and to improve the visitor experience in the park. The plan will restore meadows and river bank areas and remove non-essential roads. Camping capacity will increase by 37%, and recreational services will be expanded. The plan calls for an 8% increase in parking for day use visitors to Yosemite Valley, including a new 300-car parking lot. The plan will allow the valley to accommodate a peak of 20,100 visitors per day.

The plan has been criticized for prioritizing park visitors over the preservation of the river and the valley. Some believe there should be further limitations to the number of cars and parking lots in the valley, and more focus on public transportation. On busy summer days, there can be long delays and traffic gridlock at the entrance to Yosemite.

<text>Regina Protmann (1552 – 18 January 1613) was a Roman Catholic religious sister. She founded the Sisters of Saint Catherine and was a pioneer in the establishment of hospitals as well as schools for girls. Her first biographer was the Jesuit Engelbert Keilert who described her as an intelligent and well-versed woman with a deep faith and sense of conviction.

Her beatification was celebrated on 13 June 1999 in Warsaw.

==Life==
Regina Protmann was born in Braniewo (Braunsberg) in 1552 and to Peter Protmann and Regina née Tingel. Her father was a merchant and local patrician. Her uncle was a councilman.

Protmann became familiarized with religious and political matters during the time of the Protestant Reformation and the Counter Reformation. She joined a Marian group that the Jesuits had set up and she entrusted herself to their spiritual care. In 1571, she explained to her parents that she could not be married as expected but was devoting herself to religious studies and taking care of the sick and poor.

Despite the opposition of her parents Protmann moved out on her own and with two other women lived in an abandoned house. The group made a living in taking care of and nursing the sick and also doing housework. During a time of witch-hunt and strict counter-measures from the Roman Catholic Church it was unheard of for women to live on their own. There were no convents for women in the area at that time. 

Protmann persevered and, inspired by Saint Catherine of Alexandria, founded one which became the congregation of the Sisters of Saint Catherine. Protmann helped to nurse the sick and educated nurses while seeing to it that nurses themselves received care when it was needed. Under the government of the prince-bishops schools for males existed alone but Protmann founded schools for girls as well.

Protmann died in 1613 after a painful illness she contracted that winter while on a travel trip.

===World War II and after===
The Saint Catherine of Alexandria church in Braunsberg was ruined in 1945 during its capture by the Soviet forces during World War II. Braniewo was assigned to Poland. During the expulsion of the inhabitants of East Prussia, including the sisters of her congregation, over 100 sisters died. It was rebuilt after 1979 and in 2001 dedicated as a Minor Basilica. On 28 June 2000, Protmann was declared the patroness of Braniewo.

==Beatification==
The beatification process opened in Warmia and in Frascati in an informative that opened in 1957 and closed sometime later before it received the validation needed from the Congregation for the Causes of Saints on 19 September 1991. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints approved the cause on 27 October 1992. Pope John Paul II confirmed Protmann&#x27;s heroic virtue and name her as venerable on 17 December 1996. A miracle due to her intercession was a healing that originated in Brazil. John Paul II beatified Protmann in Warsaw on 13 June 1999. The postulator for this cause is Sr. Józefa Krause.

<doc id="50016" wikidata="Q460876" url="?curid=50016" title="Lenny Bruce">
<text>Leonard Alfred Schneider (October 13, 1925 – August 3, 1966), better known by his stage name Lenny Bruce, was an American stand-up comedian, social critic, and satirist. He was renowned for his open, free-wheeling, and critical style of comedy that combined satire, politics, religion, sex, and vulgarity. His 1964 conviction in an obscenity trial was followed by a posthumous pardon in 2003.

Bruce forged new paths in comedy and counterculture. His trial for obscenity was a landmark of freedom of speech in the United States. In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked Bruce third (behind Richard Pryor and George Carlin) on its list of the 50 best stand-up comics of all time.

==Early life==
Bruce was born Leonard Alfred Schneider in Mineola, New York, to a Jewish family. His British-born father, Myron (Mickey) Schneider, was a shoe clerk; they saw each other very infrequently. His mother, Sally Marr (legal name Sadie Schneider, born Sadie Kitchenberg), was a stage performer and dancer who had an enormous influence on his career. Bruce grew up in Bellmore, New York, and attended Wellington C. Mepham High School. For some of his high school years, he lived at Dengler&#x27;s Farm on Wantagh Avenue in Wantagh, New York. Bruce&#x27;s parents divorced before he was 10, and he lived with various relatives over the next decade.

After spending time working on a farm, Bruce joined the United States Navy at the age of 16 in 1942, with active service during World War II aboard the in Northern Africa, Palermo in 1943, and Anzio, Italy, in 1944. In May 1945, after a comedic performance for his shipmates in which he was dressed in drag, his commanding officers became upset. He defiantly convinced his ship&#x27;s medical officer that he was experiencing homosexual urges, leading to his dishonorable discharge in July 1945. However, he had not admitted to or been found guilty of any breach of naval regulations, and successfully applied to change his discharge to &quot;Under Honorable Conditions ... by reason of unsuitability for the naval service&quot;.

During the Korean War era, Bruce served in the United States Merchant Marine, ferrying troops from the US to Europe and back. In 1959, while videotaping the first episode of Hugh Hefner&#x27;s &quot;Playboy&#x27;s Penthouse&quot;, Bruce talked about his Navy experience and showed a tattoo he received in Malta in 1942.

After a short period living with his father in California, Bruce settled in New York City, hoping to establish himself as a comedian. However, he found it difficult to differentiate himself from the thousands of other show business hopefuls who populated the city. One place where they congregated was Hanson&#x27;s, a diner where Bruce met Joe Ancis, who had a profound influence on Bruce&#x27;s approach to comedy. Many of Bruce&#x27;s later routines reflected his meticulous schooling at the hands of Ancis. According to Bruce&#x27;s biographer Albert Goldman, Ancis&#x27;s humor involved stream-of-consciousness sexual fantasies and references to jazz. He also gained notoriety for his focus on controversial subjects, black humour, obscenity, and criticism of organized religion and the establishment.

Bruce took the stage as &quot;Lenny Marsalle&quot; one evening at the Victory Club as a stand-in master of ceremonies for one of his mother&#x27;s shows. His ad-libs earned him some laughs. Soon afterward, in 1947, just after changing his last name to Bruce, he earned $12 and a free spaghetti dinner for his first stand-up performance in Brooklyn. He was later a guest—and was introduced by his mother, calling herself Sally Bruce—on the &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot; radio program. Lenny did a piece inspired by Sid Caesar, &quot;The Bavarian Mimic&quot;, featuring impressions of American movie stars (e.g., Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney, and Edward G. Robinson).

==Career==
Bruce&#x27;s early comedy career included writing the screenplays for &quot;Dance Hall Racket&quot; in 1953, which featured Bruce, his wife Honey Harlow, and mother Sally Marr; &quot;Dream Follies&quot; in 1954, a low-budget burlesque romp; and a children&#x27;s film, &quot;The Rocket Man&quot;, in 1954. In 1956, Frank Ray Perilli, a fellow nightclub comedian who later wrote two dozen successful films and plays, became Bruce&#x27;s mentor and part-time manager. Through Perilli, Bruce met and collaborated with photojournalist William Karl Thomas on three screenplays (&quot;Leather Jacket&quot;, &quot;Killer&#x27;s Grave&quot; and &quot;The Degenerate&quot;), none of which made it to the screen, and the comedy material on his first three comedy albums.

Bruce was a roommate of comedian Buddy Hackett in the 1950s. The two appeared on the &quot;Patrice Munsel Show&quot; (1957–1958), calling their comedy duo the &quot;Not Ready for Prime Time Players&quot;, 20 years before the cast of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; used the same name. In 1957, Thomas booked Bruce into the Slate Brothers nightclub, where he was fired the first night for what &quot;Variety&quot; headlined as &quot;blue material&quot;. This led to the theme of Bruce&#x27;s first solo album on Berkeley-based Fantasy Records, &quot;The Sick Humor of Lenny Bruce&quot;, for which Thomas photographed the album cover. Thomas also photographed Bruce&#x27;s other covers, acted as cinematographer on abortive attempts to film their screenplays, and in 1989 wrote a memoir of their ten-year collaboration, &quot;Lenny Bruce: The Making of a Prophet&quot;. The 2016 biography of Frank Ray Perilli, &quot;The Candy Butcher&quot;, devotes a chapter to Perilli&#x27;s ten-year collaboration with Bruce.

Bruce released four albums of original material on Fantasy Records, later compiled and re-released as &quot;The Lenny Bruce Originals&quot;. Two later records were produced and sold by Bruce himself, including a 10-inch album of the 1961 San Francisco performances that started his legal troubles. Starting in the late 1960s, other unissued Bruce material was released by Alan Douglas, Frank Zappa and Phil Spector, as well as Fantasy. Bruce developed the complexity and tone of his material in Enrico Banducci&#x27;s North Beach nightclub, the hungry i, where Mort Sahl had earlier made a name for himself.

Branded a &quot;sick comic&quot;, Bruce was essentially blacklisted from television, and when he did appear, thanks to sympathetic fans like Hefner and Steve Allen, it was with great concessions to Broadcast Standards and Practices. Jokes that might offend, like a routine on airplane-glue-sniffing teenagers that was done live for &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; in 1959, had to be typed out and pre-approved by network officials. On his debut on Allen&#x27;s show, Bruce made an unscripted comment on the recent marriage of Elizabeth Taylor to Eddie Fisher, wondering, &quot;Will Elizabeth Taylor become bar mitzvahed?&quot;

In the midst of a severe blizzard, Bruce gave a famous performance at Carnegie Hall at midnight on February 4, 1961. It was recorded and later released as the three-disc set &quot;The Carnegie Hall Concert&quot;. In his posthumous biography of Bruce, Albert Goldman described that night:

In August 1965, a year before his death, Bruce gave his penultimate performance at San Francisco&#x27;s Basin Street West, mainly talking about his legal troubles. The filmed performance was released by Rhino Home Video in 1992 as &quot;The Lenny Bruce Performance Film&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1951, Bruce met Honey Harlow, a stripper from Manila, Arkansas. They were married that year, and Bruce was determined to see her stop working as a stripper. The couple left New York in 1953 for the West Coast, where they found work as a double act at the Cup and Saucer in Los Angeles. Bruce joined a bill at the club Strip City. Harlow found employment at the Colony Club, widely known as the best burlesque club in Los Angeles at the time.

Bruce left Strip City in late 1954 and found work at various strip clubs in the San Fernando Valley. As master of ceremonies, he introduced strippers while performing his material. The Valley clubs provided the perfect environment for him to create new routines. According to his primary biographer, Albert Goldman, it was &quot;precisely at the moment when he sank to the bottom of the barrel and started working the places that were the lowest of the low&quot; that he suddenly broke free of &quot;all the restraints and inhibitions and disabilities that formerly had kept him just mediocre and began to blow with a spontaneous freedom and resourcefulness that resembled the style and inspiration of his new friends and admirers, the jazz musicians of the modernist school.&quot;

Honey and Lenny&#x27;s daughter Kathleen (&quot;Kitty&quot;) Bruce was born in 1955. Honey and Lenny had a tumultuous relationship with many serious domestic disputes, usually the result of serious drug use. They broke up and reunited over and over again between 1956 and Lenny&#x27;s death in 1966. They first separated in March 1956, and were back together by July of that year when they traveled to Honolulu for a nightclub tour. During the trip, Honey was arrested for marijuana possession and prevented from leaving the island due to her parole conditions. Lenny took this opportunity to leave her again, this time kidnapping the then one-year-old Kitty. In her autobiography, Honey claimed Lenny turned her in to the police. She was later sentenced to two years in federal prison.

Bruce&#x27;s divorce from Honey was finalized in 1959. He had an affair with jazz singer Annie Ross in the late 1950s. Comedian Lotus Weinstock was Bruce&#x27;s girlfriend and fiancee at the time of his death.

Bruce had a severe drug addiction in the final decade of his life, using heroin, methamphetamine and Dilaudid daily, and suffering numerous health problems and personal strife as a result. His death was caused by an overdose.

==Legal troubles==

Bruce&#x27;s desire to help his wife stop working as a stripper led him to pursue schemes designed to make as much money as possible. The most notable was the Brother Mathias Foundation scam, which resulted in Bruce&#x27;s arrest in Miami, Florida, in 1951 for impersonating a priest. He was soliciting donations for a leper colony in British Guiana (now Guyana) under the auspices of the &quot;Brother Mathias Foundation&quot;, which he had legally chartered—the name was his own invention, but possibly referred to the actual Brother Matthias who had befriended Babe Ruth at the Baltimore orphanage where Ruth had been confined as a child.

While posing as a laundry man, Bruce stole several priests&#x27; clergy shirts and a clerical collar. He was acquitted because of the legality of the New York state-chartered foundation, the actual existence of the Guiana leper colony, and the local clergy&#x27;s inability to expose him as an impostor. Later, in his semifictional autobiography &quot;How to Talk Dirty and Influence People&quot;, Bruce said that he had made about $8,000 in three weeks, sending $2,500 to the leper colony and keeping the rest.

===Obscenity arrests===
On October 4, 1961, Bruce was arrested for obscenity at the Jazz Workshop in San Francisco, where he had used the word &quot;cocksucker&quot;, and said that &quot;to is a preposition, come is a verb&quot;; that the sexual context of &#x27;come&#x27; was so common that it bore no weight; and that if someone hearing it became upset, he &quot;probably can&#x27;t come&quot;. Although the jury acquitted him, other law enforcement agencies began monitoring his appearances, resulting in frequent arrests under obscenity charges.
Bruce was arrested again in 1961 in Philadelphia for drug possession, and again in Los Angeles two years later. The latter arrest took place in then-unincorporated West Hollywood, and the arresting officer was a young deputy named Sherman Block, who later became county sheriff. The charge this time was that the comedian had used the word &quot;schmuck&quot;, an insulting Yiddish word that was also considered a term for &quot;penis&quot;. The Hollywood charges were later dismissed.

On December 5, 1962, Bruce was arrested on stage at the Gate of Horn folk club in Chicago. That year, he played at Peter Cook&#x27;s The Establishment club in London, and in April the next year he was barred from entering the United Kingdom by the Home Office as an &quot;undesirable alien&quot;.

In April 1964, he appeared twice at the Cafe Au Go Go in Greenwich Village, with undercover police detectives in the audience. He was arrested along with club owners Howard and Elly Solomon, who were arrested for allowing an obscene performance. On both occasions, Bruce was arrested after leaving the stage.

A three-judge panel presided over his widely publicized six-month trial, prosecuted by Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Richard Kuh, with Ephraim London and Martin Garbus as the defense attorneys. Bruce and Howard Solomon were found guilty of obscenity on November 4, 1964. The conviction was announced despite positive testimony and petitions of support from—among other artists, writers and educators—Woody Allen, Bob Dylan, Jules Feiffer, Allen Ginsberg, Norman Mailer, William Styron, and James Baldwin, and Manhattan journalist and television personality Dorothy Kilgallen and sociologist Herbert Gans. Bruce was sentenced on December 21, 1964, to four months in a workhouse; he was set free on bail during the appeals process and died before the appeal was decided. Solomon, the owner of the club where Lenny was arrested, later saw Bruce&#x27;s conviction overturned.

==Later years==
Bruce appeared on network television only six times. In his later club performances, he was known for relating the details of his encounters with the police directly in his comedy routine. These performances often included rants about his court battles over obscenity charges, tirades against fascism, and complaints that he was being denied his right to freedom of speech. He was banned outright from several U.S. cities.

In September 1962, his only visit to Australia caused a media storm, although he was neither banned nor forced to leave the country. He was booked for a two-week engagement at Aaron&#x27;s Exchange Hotel, a small pub in central Sydney, by American-born, Australia-based promoter Lee Gordon, who was by then deeply in debt, nearing the end of his formerly successful career, and desperate to save his business. Bruce&#x27;s first show at 9 p.m. on September 6 was uneventful, but his second show at 11 p.m. led to major public controversy. Bruce was heckled by audience members, and when local actress Barbara Wyndon stood up and complained that Bruce was only talking about America and asked him to talk about something different, a clearly annoyed Bruce responded, &quot;Fuck you, madam. That&#x27;s different, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; Bruce&#x27;s remark shocked some audience members and several walked out.

By the next day, several Sydney papers denounced Bruce as &quot;sick&quot;; one illustrated their story with a retouched photograph appearing to show Bruce giving a fascist salute. The venue owners cancelled the rest of Bruce&#x27;s performances, and he retreated to his Kings Cross hotel room. Local university students (including future &quot;OZ&quot; magazine editor Richard Neville), who were fans of Bruce&#x27;s humor tried to arrange a performance at the Roundhouse at the University of New South Wales, but at the last minute the university&#x27;s vice-chancellor rescinded permission to use the venue, with no reason given, and an interview Bruce was scheduled to give on Australian television was cancelled by the Australian Broadcasting Commission.

Bruce remained largely confined to his hotel, but eight days later gave his third and last Australian concert at the Wintergarden Theatre in Sydney&#x27;s eastern suburbs. Although it had a capacity of 2,100, only 200 people attended, including a strong police presence, and Bruce gave what was described as a &quot;subdued&quot; performance. It was long rumored that a tape recording of the historic performance was made by police, but it was in fact recorded by local jazz saxophonist Sid Powell, who brought a portable tape recorder to the show. The tape was rediscovered in 2011 in the possession of Australian singer Sammy Gaha, who had acted as Bruce&#x27;s chauffeur during his visit; it was subsequently donated to the Lenny Bruce audio collection at Brandeis University. Bruce left the country a few days later and spoke little about the experience.

Increasing drug use also affected Bruce&#x27;s health and repeated arrests further caused deterioration to his mental health. By 1966, he had been blacklisted by nearly every nightclub in the U.S. as owners feared prosecution for obscenity. He gave a famous performance at the Berkeley Community Theatre in December 1965, which was recorded and became his last live album, &quot;The Berkeley Concert&quot;. The performance has been described as lucid, clear and calm, and one of his best. His last performance took place on June 25, 1966, at The Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco, on a bill with Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention. The performance was not remembered fondly by Bill Graham, whose memoir describes Bruce as &quot;whacked out on amphetamine&quot;; Graham thought that Bruce finished his set emotionally disturbed. Zappa asked Bruce to sign his draft card, but the suspicious Bruce refused.

At the request of Hefner and with the aid of Paul Krassner, Bruce wrote an autobiography that was serialized in &quot;Playboy&quot; in 1964 and 1965. It was later published as &quot;How to Talk Dirty and Influence People&quot;. During this time, Bruce also contributed a number of articles to Krassner&#x27;s satirical magazine &quot;The Realist&quot;.

==Death and posthumous pardon==

On August 3, 1966, Bruce was found dead in the bathroom of his Hollywood Hills home. The official photo taken at the scene showed him lying naked on the floor, a syringe and burned bottle cap nearby, along with various other narcotics paraphernalia. Record producer Phil Spector, a friend of Bruce&#x27;s, bought the negatives of the photographs &quot;to keep them from the press&quot;. The official cause of death was &quot;acute morphine poisoning caused by an overdose&quot;.

Bruce&#x27;s remains were interred in Eden Memorial Park Cemetery in Mission Hills, California, but an unconventional memorial on August 21 was controversial enough to keep his name in the spotlight. Over 500 people came to the service to pay their respects, led by Spector. Cemetery officials tried to block the ceremony after ads for it encouraged attendees to bring box lunches and noisemakers. Delivering the eulogy, featured at the end of the documentary &quot;Lenny Bruce: Without Tears&quot;, the Rev. William Glenesk said:

Bruce&#x27;s epitaph reads: &quot;Beloved father—devoted son / Peace at last&quot;. Dick Schaap concluded his eulogy to Bruce in &quot;Playboy&quot; with the words: &quot;One last four-letter word for Lenny: Dead. At forty. &quot;That&#x27;s&quot; obscene&quot;. A memorial event was held at the Judson Memorial Church in New York City on August 12, which was &quot;packed to overflowing&quot; an hour before it was due to get underway. It was attended by prominent members of the arts community, many of whom also performed, and included Allen Ginsberg, Joe Lee Wilson, Jean Shepherd, Charlie Haden, and The Fugs; Paul Krassner officiated.

On December 23, 2003, 37 years after Bruce&#x27;s death, New York Governor George Pataki granted him a posthumous pardon for his obscenity conviction.

==Legacy==
Bruce was the subject of the 1974 biographical drama &quot;Lenny&quot;, directed by Bob Fosse and starring Dustin Hoffman, who was nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award for the role. It was based on the Broadway stage play of the same name by Julian Barry, which starred Cliff Gorman in his 1972 Tony Award-winning role. The main character&#x27;s editing of a fictionalized film version of &quot;Lenny&quot; was also a major part of Fosse&#x27;s own autobiopic, the 1979 Academy Award-nominated &quot;All That Jazz&quot;, where Gorman again played Bruce.

The documentary film &quot;Lenny Bruce: Swear to Tell the Truth&quot; (1998), directed by Robert B. Weide and narrated by Robert De Niro, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.

Episode 12 of Season 1 of &quot;Liberty on Trial in America: Cases That Defined Freedom&quot;, aired on January 3, 2020, explored the ways in which Bruce and the First Amendment affected each other.

In 2004, Comedy Central placed Bruce at number three on its list of the 100 greatest stand-ups of all time, above Woody Allen (4th) and below Richard Pryor (1st) and George Carlin (2nd). Both comedians who ranked higher than Bruce considered him a major influence. Pryor said that hearing Bruce for the first time &quot;changed my life&quot;; while Carlin said that Bruce was a &quot;brilliant comedian&quot; who influenced him as much as a man in his moral thinking and attitudes as he did as a comedian. Carlin was arrested along with Bruce after refusing to provide identification when police raided a Bruce performance.

<text>Hope is an optimistic state of mind that is based on an of positive outcomes with respect to events and circumstances in one&#x27;s own life, or the world at large. As a verb, Merriam-Webster defines &quot;hope&quot; as &quot;to expect with confidence&quot; or &quot;to cherish a desire with anticipation&quot;.

Among its opposites are dejection, hopelessness, and despair.

Hope finds expression through many dimensions of human life, including practical reasoning, the religious virtue of hope, legal doctrine, and literature, alongside cultural and mythological aspects.

==In psychology==
American professor of psychology Barbara Fredrickson argues that hope comes into its own when crisis looms, opening us to new creative possibilities. Frederickson argues that with great need comes an unusually wide range of ideas, as well as such positive emotions as happiness and joy, courage, and empowerment, drawn from four different areas of one&#x27;s self: from a cognitive, psychological, social, or physical perspective. Such positive thinking bears fruit when based on a realistic sense of optimism, not on a naive &quot;false hope&quot;.

The psychologist Charles R. Snyder linked hope to the existence of a goal, combined with a determined plan for reaching that goal. Alfred Adler had similarly argued for the centrality of goal-seeking in human psychology, as too had philosophical anthropologists like Ernst Bloch. Snyder also stressed the link between hope and mental willpower (hardiness), as well as the need for realistic perception of goals (problem orientation), arguing that the difference between hope and optimism was that the former can look like wishful thinking but the latter provides the energy to find practical pathways for an improved future. D. W. Winnicott saw a child&#x27;s antisocial behavior as expressing as a cry for help, an unconscious hope, meaning an unspoken desire for a positive outcome for those who are in control in the wider society, when containment within the immediate family had failed. Object relations theory similarly sees the analytic transference as motivated in part by an unconscious hope that past conflicts and traumas can be dealt with anew.

===Hope Theory===
As a specialist in positive psychology, Snyder studied how hope and forgiveness can impact several aspects of life such as health, work, education, and personal meaning. He postulated that three main things make up hopeful thinking:

* Goals – Approaching life in a goal-oriented way.
* Pathways – Finding different ways to achieve your goals.
* Agency – Believing that you can instigate change and achieve these goals.

In other words, hope was defined as the perceived capability to derive pathways to desired goals and motivate oneself via agency thinking to use those pathways.

Snyder argues that individuals who are able to realize these three components and develop a belief in their ability are hopeful people who can establish clear goals, imagine multiple workable pathways toward those goals, and persevere, even when obstacles get in their way.

Snyder proposed a &quot;Hope Scale&quot; which considered that a person&#x27;s determination to achieve their goal is their measured hope. Snyder differentiates between adult-measured hope and child-measured hope. The Adult Hope Scale by Snyder contains 12 questions: 4 measuring &#x27;pathways thinking&#x27;, 4 measuring &#x27;agency thinking&#x27;, and 4 that are simply fillers. Each subject responds to each question using an 8-point scale. Fibel and Hale measure hope by combining Snyder&#x27;s Hope Scale with their own Generalized Expectancy for Success Scale (GESS) to empirically measure hope. Snyder regarded that psychotherapy can help focus attention on one&#x27;s goals, drawing on tacit knowledge of how to reach them. Similarly, there is an &quot;outlook&quot; and a &quot;grasp of reality&quot; to hope, distinguishing No Hope, Lost Hope, False Hope and Real Hope, which differ in terms of viewpoint and realism.

Contemporary philosopher Richard Rorty understands hope as more than goal setting, rather as a metanarrative, a story that serves as a promise or reason for expecting a better future. Rorty as postmodernist believes past meta-narratives, including the Christian story, utilitarianism, and Marxism have proved false hopes; that theory cannot offer social hope; and that liberal man must learn to live without a consensual theory of social hope. Rorty says a new document of promise is needed for social hope to exist again.

=== Major theories ===
Of the countless models that examine the importance of hope in an individual&#x27;s life, two major theories have gained a significant amount of recognition in the field of psychology. One of these theories, developed by Charles R. Snyder, argues that hope should be viewed as a cognitive skill that demonstrates an individual&#x27;s ability to maintain drive in the pursuit of a particular goal. This model reasons that an individual&#x27;s ability to be hopeful depends on two types of thinking: agency thinking and pathway thinking. Agency thinking refers to an individual&#x27;s determination to achieve their goals despite possible obstacles, while pathway thinking refers to the ways in which an individual believes they can achieve these personal goals.

Snyder&#x27;s theory uses hope as a mechanism that is most often seen in psychotherapy. In these instances, the therapist helps their client overcome barriers that have prevented them from achieving goals. The therapist would then help the client set realistic and relevant personal goals (i.e. &quot;I am going to find something I am passionate about and that makes me feel good about myself&quot;), and would help them remain hopeful of their ability to achieve these goals, and suggest the correct pathways to do so.

Whereas Snyder&#x27;s theory focuses on hope as a mechanism to overcome an individual&#x27;s lack of motivation to achieve goals, the other major theory developed by Kaye A. Herth deals more specifically with an individual&#x27;s future goals as they relate to coping with illnesses. Herth views hope as &quot;a motivational and cognitive attribute that is theoretically necessary to initiate and sustain action toward goal attainment&quot;. Establishing realistic and attainable goals in this situation is more difficult, as the individual most likely does not have direct control over the future of their health. Instead, Herth suggests that the goals should be concerned with how the individual is going to personally deal with the illness—&quot;Instead of drinking to ease the pain of my illness, I am going to surround myself with friends and family&quot;.

While the nature of the goals in Snyder&#x27;s model differ with those in Herth&#x27;s model, they both view hope as a way to maintain personal motivation, which ultimately will result in a greater sense of optimism.

=== Major empirical findings ===
Hope, and more specifically, particularized hope, has been shown to be an important part of the recovery process from illness; it has strong psychological benefits for patients, helping them to cope more effectively with their disease. For example, hope motivates people to pursue healthy behaviors for recovery, such as eating fruits and vegetables, quitting smoking, and engaging in regular physical activity. This not only helps to enhance people&#x27;s recovery from illnesses but also helps prevent illness from developing in the first place. Patients who maintain high levels of hope have an improved prognosis for life-threatening illness and an enhanced quality of life. Belief and expectation, which are key elements of hope, block pain in patients suffering from chronic illness by releasing endorphins and mimicking the effects of morphine. Consequently, through this process, belief and expectation can set off a chain reaction in the body that can make recovery from chronic illness more likely. This chain reaction is especially evident with studies demonstrating the placebo effect, a situation when hope is the only variable aiding in these patients’ recovery.

Overall, studies have demonstrated that maintaining a sense of hope during a period of recovery from illness is beneficial. A sense of hopelessness during the recovery period has, in many instances, resulted in adverse health conditions for the patient (i.e. depression and anxiety following the recovery process). Additionally, having a greater amount of hope before and during cognitive therapy has led to decreased PTSD-related depression symptoms in war veterans. Hope has also been found to be associated with more positive perceptions of subjective health. However, reviews of research literature have noted that the connections between hope and symptom severity in other mental health disorders are less clear, such as in cases of individuals with schizophrenia.

Hope is a powerful protector against chronic or life-threatening illnesses. A person’s hope (even when facing an illness that will likely end their life) can be helpful by finding joy or comfort. It can be created and focused on achieving life goals, such as meeting grandchildren or attending a child’s wedding. Hope can be an opportunity for us to process and go through events, that can be traumatic. A setback in life, an accident, or our own final months of living can be times when hope is comfort and serves as a pathway from one stage to the next.

Hope is a powerful emotion that drives us to keep working and moving forward. It gives us the power to survive. In a study conducted by Harvard, Curt Richter experimented with 12 wild rats and 12 domesticated rats. The wild rats, known for their great swimming abilities, survived for only about two minutes when placed in a glass container of water with no way of escape. In contrast, the domesticated rats survived for days. Curt attributed this difference to hope. The domesticated rats hoped to be saved from drowning, but the wild rats had no such hope, as they had never experienced rescue.

Curt decided to run another experiment with 12 wild rats. He placed them in water, and when they were about to drown, he took them out and held them briefly, creating an experience of hope. He then returned the rats to the water to observe how long they would tread water. Remarkably, they survived just as long as the domesticated rats—about 60 hours. With hope, the rats went from surviving for 2 minutes to treading water for 60 hours.

Hope is a powerful emotion. It drives us to move faster, further, and longer than we thought possible. But for hope to thrive, it must be anchored in something more powerful than ourselves. The rats had hope that a saving hand would come and lift them out of the water. 

=== Applications ===
The inclusion of hope in treatment programs has potential in both physical and mental health settings. Hope as a mechanism for improved treatment has been studied in the contexts of PTSD, chronic physical illness, and terminal illness, among other disorders and ailments. Within mental health practice, clinicians have suggested using hope interventions as a supplement to more traditional cognitive behavioral therapies. In terms of support for physical illness, research suggests that hope can encourage the release of endorphins and enkephalins, which help to block pain.

=== Impediments ===
There are two main arguments based on judgment against those who are advocates of using hope to help treat severe illnesses. The first of which is that if physicians have too much hope, they may aggressively treat the patient. The physician will hold on to a small shred of hope that the patient may get better. Thus, this causes them to try methods that are costly and may have many side effects. One physician noted that she regretted having hope for her patient; it resulted in her patient suffering through three more years of pain that the patient would not have endured if the physician had realized recovery was unfeasible.

The second argument is the division between hope and wishing. Those that are hopeful are actively trying to investigate the best path of action while taking into consideration the obstacles. Research has shown though that many of those who have &quot;hope&quot; are wishfully thinking and passively going through the motions, as if they are in denial about their actual circumstances. Being in denial and having too much hope may negatively impact both the patient and the physician.

=== Benefits ===
The impact that hope can have on a patient&#x27;s recovery process is strongly supported through both empirical research and theoretical approaches. However, reviews of literature also maintain that more longitudinal and methodologically sound research is needed to establish which hope interventions are actually the most effective, and in what setting (i.e. chronic illness vs. terminal illness).

== In culture ==
In the matter of globalization, hope is focused on economic and social empowerment.

Focusing on parts of Asia, hope has taken on a secular or materialistic form in relation to the pursuit of economic growth. Primary examples are the rise of the economies of China and India, correlating with the notion of Chindia. A secondary relevant example is the increased use of contemporary architecture in rising economies, such as the building of the Shanghai World Financial Center, Burj Khalifa and Taipei 101, which has given rise to a prevailing hope within the countries of origin. In chaotic environments hope is transcended without cultural boundaries, Syrian refugee children are supported by UNESCO&#x27;s education project through creative education and psycho-social assistance. Other inter-cultural support for instilling hope involve food culture, disengaging refugees from trauma through immersing them in their rich cultural past.

== The Right to Hope ==
Hope has been widely recognized as a crucial and inherent aspect of human existence, not only by philosophers from various backgrounds but also by national and international courts, particularly in the past decade. Serving as an existential element within each individual, hope manifests itself in various ways in both private and public spheres. While past court considerations often focused on hopes arising from legal disputes and everyday life, the current predominant topic of discussion centers around the hope of incarcerated individuals seeking release, as in Graham v. Florida.

Riofrio&#x27;s examination delves not only into specific expressions of the right to hope but also into the right to hope itself as a comprehensive concept. In this exploration, he draws connections between numerous legal doctrines addressing everyday hopes, such as the doctrines of legitimate expectations and loss of a chance.

Drawing insights from extensive case law explicitly referencing the right to hope, international legal precedents, philosophical teachings from eminent scholars, and certain theological arguments, Riofrio concludes that the unenumerated right to hope encompasses four essential elements:

# The right to have wishes, aspirations, plans, and beliefs, while avoiding actions that illegitimately discourage individuals, such as demoralizing troops during wartime.
# The right to some specific opportunities, sometimes aligning with programmatic Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ESCR), but also incorporating the doctrine of legitimate expectations.
# The right to the means of realizing hope, prohibiting harm to the means that grounds hope, such as the limbs of a dancer or the vision of a painter.
# The right to some established chances, wherein the doctrine of loss of a chance plays a significant role.

== In literature ==
A classic reference to hope which has entered modern language is the concept that &quot;Hope springs eternal&quot; taken from Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;Essay on Man&quot;, the phrase reading &quot;Hope springs eternal in the human breast, Man never is, but always &quot;to be&quot; blest:&quot; Another popular reference, &quot;Hope is the thing with feathers,&quot; is from a poem by Emily Dickinson.

Hope can be used as an artistic plot device and is often a motivating force for change in dynamic characters. A commonly understood reference from western popular culture is the subtitle &quot;A New Hope&quot; from the original first installment (now considered Episode IV) in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; science fiction space opera. The subtitle refers to one of the lead characters, Luke Skywalker, who is expected in the future to allow good to triumph over evil within the plot of the films.

The swallow has been a symbol of hope, in Aesop&#x27;s fables and numerous other historic literature. It symbolizes hope, in part because it is among the first birds to appear at the end of winter and the start of spring. Other symbols of hope include the anchor and the dove.

Nietzsche took a contrarian but coherent view of hope:-

== In mythology ==
Elpis (Hope) appears in ancient Greek mythology with the story of Zeus and Prometheus. Prometheus stole fire from the god Zeus, which infuriated the supreme god. In turn, Zeus created a box that contained all manners of evil, unbeknownst to the receiver of the box. Pandora opened the box after being warned not to, and unleashed a multitude of harmful spirits that inflicted plagues, diseases, and illnesses on mankind. Spirits of greed, envy, hatred, mistrust, sorrow, anger, revenge, lust, and despair scattered far and wide looking for humans to torment. Inside the box, however, there was also an unreleased healing spirit named Hope. From ancient times, people have recognized that a spirit of hope had the power to heal afflictions and helps them bear times of great suffering, illnesses, disasters, loss, and pain caused by the malevolent spirits and events. In Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Works and Days&quot;, the personification of hope is named Elpis.
Norse mythology however considered Hope (&quot;Vön&quot;) to be the slobber dripping from the mouth of Fenris Wolf: their concept of courage rated most highly a cheerful bravery in the &quot;absence&quot; of hope.

== In religion ==
Hope is a key concept in most major world religions, often signifying the &quot;hoper&quot; believes an individual or a collective group will reach a concept of heaven. Depending on the religion, hope can be seen as a prerequisite for and/or byproduct of spiritual attainment.

===Judaism===
The Jewish Encyclopedia notes &quot;tiḳwah&quot; (תקווה) and &quot;seber&quot; as terms for hope, adding that &quot;miḳweh&quot; and &quot;kislah&quot; denote the related concept of &quot;trust&quot; and that &quot;toḥelet&quot; signifies &quot;expectation&quot;.

=== Christianity ===

Hope is one of the three theological virtues of the Christian religion, alongside faith and love. &quot;Hope&quot; in the Holy Bible means &quot;a strong and confident expectation&quot; of future reward (see Titus 1:2). In modern terms, hope is akin to trust and a confident expectation&quot;. Paul the Apostle argued that Christ was a source of hope for Christians: &quot;For in this hope we have been saved&quot; (see Romans 8:24).

According to the &quot;Holman Bible Dictionary&quot;, hope is a &quot;[t]rustful expectation...the anticipation of a favorable outcome under God&#x27;s guidance.&quot; In &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, it is Hopeful who comforts Christian in Doubting Castle; while conversely at the entrance to Dante&#x27;s Hell were the words, &quot;Lay down all hope, you that go in by me&quot;.

=== Hinduism ===
In historic literature of Hinduism, hope is referred to with &quot;Pratidhi&quot; (Sanskrit: प्रतिधी), or &quot;Apêksh&quot; (Sanskrit: अपेक्ष). It is discussed with the concepts of desire and wish. In Vedic philosophy, &quot;karma&quot; was linked to ritual sacrifices (&quot;yajna&quot;), hope and success linked to correct performance of these rituals. In Vishnu Smriti, the image of hope, morals and work is represented as the virtuous man who rides in a chariot directed by his hopeful mind to his desired wishes, drawn by his five senses, who keeps the chariot on the path of the virtuous, and thus is not distracted by the wrongs such as wrath, greed, and other vices.

In the centuries that followed, the concept of &quot;karma&quot; changed from sacramental rituals to actual human action that builds and serves society and human existence–a philosophy epitomized in the Bhagavad Gita. Hope, in the structure of beliefs and motivations, is a long-term &quot;karmic&quot; concept. In Hindu belief, actions have consequences, and while one&#x27;s effort and work may or may not bear near term fruits, it will serve the good, that the journey of one&#x27;s diligent efforts (karma) and how one pursues the journey, sooner or later leads to bliss and moksha.

=== Buddhism ===
Buddhism&#x27;s teachings are centered around the concept of hope. It puts those who are suffering on a path to a more harmonious world and better well-being. Hope acts as a light to those who are lost or suffering. Factors of Saddha (faith), wisdom, and aspiration work together to form practical hope. Practical hope is the foundation of putting those suffering on a path toward inner freedom and holistic well-being. It instills the belief in positive outcomes even in the midst of suffering and adversity.

<text>A gift or present is an item given to someone (who is not already the owner) without the expectation of payment or anything in return. Although gift-giving might involve an expectation of reciprocity, a gift is intended to be free. In many countries, the act of mutually exchanging money, goods, etc., may sustain social relationships and contribute to social cohesion. Economists have elaborated the economics of gift-giving into the notion of a gift economy. By extension, the term &quot;gift&quot; can refer to any item or act of service that makes the other happier or less sad, especially as a favor, including forgiveness and kindness. Gifts are often presented on occasions such as birthdays and holidays.

== History ==
=== Ancient ===
=== Medieval ===
In the 760s, Bregowin (archbishop of Canterbury) gave a bone casket to Lul (the bishop of Mainz). This was the only known instance of gift-giving between 8th-century missionaries.

Donations to monasteries in medieval Europe peaked between the 9th and 12th centuries. Eventually, people began to explain this by claiming that monks or other holy people contributed disproportionately to a &quot;treasure of merit&quot;.

In sixteenth and seventeenth century France, gift-giving was often patronage in disguise. This was hidden by terms like , , and . Sometimes actual gifts were given with patron-client letters. These often included money, hunting birds, food, and cloth, and occasionally messengers as well.

=== Modern ===
Gift-giving during Christmas celebrations in the U.S. began in the early 19th century, initially in the Mid-Atlantic region. This kind of celebration was Northern European and had its roots in Lutheran theology. During this era, gifts were usually small and handmade.

In the late 19th century, U.S. Christmas celebrations began to grow in scale, with more manufacturing of goods. As early as 1880, the country&#x27;s businesspeople had begun taking advantage of the holiday to sell more.

In Japan, Valentine&#x27;s Day gift giving was introduced by Morozoff Ltd. in 1936, and initially targeted foreigners living near Kobe. The holiday was then reintroduced in the 1950s, but was not popular. It only became popular in the 1970s, when it was framed as a time for women to give gifts to men. To fix the gender imbalance, White Day was introduced for the men to give back to women. The typical gift on Valentine&#x27;s Day in Japan is &quot;giri choko&quot; (&quot;obligation chocolate&quot;). Typical gifts on White Day include chocolate, jewelry, and clothes.

== Presentation ==
In many cultures gifts are traditionally packaged in some way. For example, in Western cultures, gifts are often wrapped in wrapping paper and accompanied by a gift note which may note the occasion, the recipient&#x27;s name and the giver&#x27;s name. In Chinese culture, red wrapping connotes luck. Although inexpensive gifts are common among colleagues, associates and acquaintances, expensive or amorous gifts are considered more appropriate among close friends, romantic interests or relatives.

== Gift-giving occasions ==


Gift-giving occasions may be:
* An expression of love or friendship
* An expression of gratitude for a gift received.
* An expression of piety, in the form of charity.
* An expression of solidarity, in the form of mutual aid.
* To share wealth.
* To offset misfortune.
* Offering travel souvenirs.
* Custom, on occasions (often celebrations) such as
** A birthday (the person who has his or her birthday gives cake, etc. and/or receives gifts).
** A potlatch, in societies where status is associated with gift-giving rather than acquisition.
** Christmas (throughout the history of Christmas gift giving, people have given one another gifts, often pretending they are left by Santa Claus, the Christ Child or Saint Nicholas).
** Feast of Saint Nicholas (people give each other gifts, often supposedly receiving them from Saint Nicholas).

== Promotional gifts ==
Promotional gifts differ from regular gifts. Recipients may include employees or clients. These gifts are primarily used for advertising. They help promote the brand name and increase its awareness. In promotional gifting, the quality and presentation of the gifts are more important than the gifts themselves, as they serve as a gateway to acquire new clients or associates. 

== As reinforcement and manipulation ==
Giving a gift to someone is not necessarily just an altruistic act. It may be given in the hope that the receiver reciprocates in a particular way. It may take the form of positive reinforcement as a reward for compliance, possibly for an underhand manipulative and abusive purpose.

==Unwanted gifts==

Giving the appropriate gift that aligns with the recipient&#x27;s preferences poses a formidable challenge. Gift givers commonly err in the process of gift selection, either by offering gifts that the recipients&#x27; do not wish to receive or by failing to provide gifts that recipients earnestly desired. For example, givers avoid giving the same gifts more than once while recipients are more open to receiving a repeated gift, givers prefer to avoid giving self-improvement products (e.g., self-help books) as gifts while recipients are more open to receiving such gifts, when choosing between giving digital and physical gift cards, givers opt for the latter more often than recipients want, and many receivers prefer a future experience instead of an object, or a practical gift that they have requested over a more expensive, showier gift chosen by the giver. One cause of the mismatch between the giver&#x27;s and receiver&#x27;s view is that the giver is focused on the act of giving the gift, while the receiver is more interested in the long-term utilitarian value of the gift.

Due to the mismatch between givers&#x27; and recipients&#x27; gift preferences, a significant fraction of gifts are unwanted, or the giver pays more for the item than the recipient values it, resulting in a misallocation of economic resources known as a deadweight loss. Unwanted gifts are often &quot;regifted&quot;, donated to charity, or thrown away. A gift that actually imposes a burden on the recipient, either due to maintenance or storage or disposal costs, is known as a white elephant.

One means of reducing the mismatch between the buyer and receivers&#x27; tastes is advance coordination, often undertaken in the form of a wedding registry or Christmas list. Wedding registries in particular are often kept at a single store, which can designate the exact items to be purchased (resulting in matching housewares), and to coordinate purchases so the same gift is not purchased by different guests. One study found that wedding guests who departed from the registry typically did so because they wished to signal a closer relationship to the couple by personalizing a gift, and also found that as a result of not abiding by the recipients&#x27; preferences, their gifts were appreciated less often. 

An estimated $3.4 billion was spent on unwanted Christmas gifts in the United States in 2017 and $10.1 billion in 2024 .The day after Christmas is typically the busiest day for returns in countries with large Christmas gift giving traditions. The total unredeemed value of gift cards purchased in the U.S. each year is estimated to be about a billion dollars.

In some cases, people know the preferences of recipients very well, and can give highly valued gifts. Some value in gift-giving comes from assisted preference discovery - people receiving gifts they did not know they would like, or which they did not know were available. Behavioral economists propose that the non-material value of gifts lies in strengthening relationships by signalling the giver was thoughtful, or spent time and effort on the gift.

== Legal aspects ==
At common law, for a gift to have legal effect, it was required that there be (1) intent by the donor to give a gift, and (2) delivery to the recipient of the item to be given as a gift.

In some countries, certain types of gifts above a certain monetary amount are subject to taxation. For the United States, see Gift tax in the United States.

In some contexts, gift giving can be construed as bribery. This tends to occur in situations where the gift is given with an implicit or explicit agreement between the giver of the gift and its receiver that some type of service will be rendered (often outside of normal legitimate methods) because of the gift. Some groups, such as government workers, may have strict rules concerning gift giving and receiving so as to avoid the appearance of impropriety.

Cross border monetary gifts are subject to taxation in both source and destination countries based on the treaty between the two countries.

== Religious views ==
Lewis Hyde claims in &quot;The Gift&quot; that Christianity considers the Incarnation and subsequent death of Jesus to be the greatest gift to humankind, and that the Jataka contains a tale of the Buddha in his incarnation as the Wise Hare giving the ultimate alms by offering himself up as a meal for Sakka. (Hyde, 1983, 58–60)

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the bread and wine that are consecrated during the Divine Liturgy are referred to as &quot;the Gifts.&quot; They are first of all the gifts of the community (both individually and corporately) to God, and then, after the epiklesis, the Gifts of the Body and Blood of Christ to the Church.

Ritual sacrifices can be seen as return gifts to a deity.

<text>Lancaster ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Fairfield County, Ohio, in the south-central part of the state. As of the 2020 United States census, the city population was 40,552. The city is near the Hocking River, about southeast of Columbus and southwest of Zanesville. It is part of the Columbus metropolitan area.

== History ==
The earliest known inhabitants of the southeastern and central Ohio region were the Hopewell, Adena, and Fort Ancient Native Americans, of whom little evidence survived, beyond the burial and ceremonial mounds built throughout the Ohio and Mississippi Valleys. Many mounds and burial sites have also yielded archaeological artifacts. Serpent Mound and Hopewell Culture National Historical Park, though not in Fairfield County, are nearby.

Before and immediately after European settlement, the land today comprising Lancaster and Fairfield County was inhabited by the Shawnee, nations of the Iroquois, Wyandot, and other Native American tribes. It served as a natural crossroads for the inter- and intra-tribal wars fought at various times. Frontier explorer Christopher Gist reached Lancaster&#x27;s vicinity on January 19, 1751, when he visited the small Delaware town of Hockhocking nearby. Leaving the area the next day, Gist rode southwest to Maguck, another Delaware town near Circleville.

Having been ceded to the United States by Great Britain after the American Revolution in the Treaty of Paris, the lands north of the Ohio River and west of the Appalachian Mountains were incorporated into the Northwest Territory in 1787. White settlers began to encroach on Native American lands in the Northwest Territory. As the new United States government began to cast its eye westward, the stage was set for the series of campaigns that culminated in the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794 and the Treaty of Greenville in 1795. With pioneer settlement within Ohio made legal and safe from Indian raids, developers began to speculate in land sales in earnest.

Knowing that such speculation, combined with congressional grants of land sections to veterans of the Revolution, could result in a lucrative opportunity, in 1796 Ebenezer Zane petitioned Congress to grant him a contract to blaze a trail through Ohio, from Wheeling, West Virginia, to Limestone, Kentucky (near modern Maysville, Kentucky), a distance of . As part of the deal, Zane was awarded square-mile tracts of land at the points where his trace crossed the Hocking, Muskingum, and Scioto Rivers. Zane&#x27;s Trace, as it is now known, was completed by 1797. As Zane&#x27;s sons began to carve the square-mile tract astride the Hocking into saleable plots, the village of Lancaster was founded in 1800. Lancaster antedated the formal establishment of the state of Ohio by three years. Many villages and townships right outside Lancaster, such as Lithopolis, Royalton, and Greencastle, were settled around the same time, which contributed to the village&#x27;s success.

Initially known as New Lancaster, and later shortened by city ordinance (1805), the town quickly grew; formal incorporation as a city came in 1831. The connection of the Hocking Canal to the Ohio and Erie Canal in this era provided a way for the region&#x27;s rich agricultural produce to reach eastern markets.

The initial settlers were predominantly German immigrants and their descendants, many from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Ohio&#x27;s longest continuously operating newspaper, the &quot;Lancaster Eagle-Gazette&quot;, was born of a merger of the early &quot;Ohio Adler&quot;, founded around 1807, with the &quot;Ohio Gazette&quot;, founded in the 1830s. The two papers were ferocious competitors since they were on opposite sides of the American Civil War, with the &quot;Adler&quot; antislavery and pro-Union. The city also had numerous migrants from the Upper South who sympathized with the Confederacy. The papers merged in 1937, 72 years after the war&#x27;s end. This was shortly after the &quot;Gazette&quot; was acquired by glassmaker Anchor-Hocking. The newspaper is currently part of the Newspaper Network of Central Ohio, a unit of Gannett Company, Inc.

<doc id="50023" wikidata="Q223681" url="?curid=50023" title="Apostasy">
<text>Apostasy (; ) is the formal disaffiliation from, abandonment of, or renunciation of a religion by a person. It can also be defined within the broader context of embracing an opinion that is contrary to one&#x27;s previous religious beliefs. One who undertakes apostasy is known as an apostate. Undertaking apostasy is called apostatizing (or apostasizing – also spelled apostacizing). The term &quot;apostasy&quot; is used by sociologists to mean the renunciation &quot;and&quot; criticism of, or opposition to, a person&#x27;s former religion, in a technical sense, with no pejorative connotation.

Occasionally, the term is also used metaphorically to refer to the renunciation of a non-religious belief or cause, such as a political party, social movement, or sports team.

Apostasy is generally not a self-definition: few former believers call themselves apostates due to the term&#x27;s negative connotation.

Many religious groups and some states punish apostates; this may be the official policy of a particular religious group or it may simply be the voluntary action of its members. Such punishments may include shunning, excommunication, verbal abuse, physical violence, or even execution.

==Sociological definitions==
The American sociologist Lewis A. Coser (following the German philosopher and sociologist Max Scheler) defines an apostate as not just a person who experienced a dramatic change in conviction but &quot;a man who, even in his new state of belief, is spiritually living not primarily in the content of that faith, in the pursuit of goals appropriate to it, but only in the struggle against the old faith and for the sake of its negation.&quot;

The American sociologist David G. Bromley defined the apostate role as follows and distinguished it from the defector and whistleblower roles.
* &quot;Apostate role&quot;: defined as one that occurs in a highly polarized situation in which an organization member undertakes a total change of loyalties by allying with one or more elements of an oppositional coalition without the consent or control of the organization. The narrative documents the quintessentially evil essence of the apostate&#x27;s former organization chronicled through the apostate&#x27;s personal experience of capture and ultimate escape/rescue.
* &quot;Defector role&quot;: an organizational participant negotiates exit primarily with organizational authorities, who grant permission for role relinquishment, control the exit process and facilitate role transmission. The jointly constructed narrative assigns primary moral responsibility for role performance problems to the departing member and interprets organizational permission as commitment to extraordinary moral standards and preservation of public trust.
* &quot;Whistle-blower role&quot;: defined here as when an organization member forms an alliance with an external regulatory agency through personal testimony concerning specific, contested organizational practices that the external unit uses to sanction the organization. The narrative constructed jointly by the whistle blower and regulatory agency depicts the whistle-blower as motivated by personal conscience, and the organization by defense of the public interest.

Stuart A. Wright, an American sociologist and author, asserts that apostasy is a unique phenomenon and a distinct type of religious defection in which the apostate is a defector &quot;who is aligned with an oppositional coalition in an effort to broaden the dispute, and embraces public claims-making activities to attack his or her former group.&quot;

==Human rights==

The United Nations Commission on Human Rights, considers the recanting of a person&#x27;s religion a human right legally protected by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights:
== History ==
As early as the 3rd century AD, apostasy against the Zoroastrian faith in the Sasanian Empire was criminalized. The high priest, Kidir, instigated pogroms against Jews, Christians, Buddhists, and others in an effort to solidify the hold of the state religion.

As the Roman Empire adopted Christianity as its state religion, apostasy became formally criminalized in the Theodosian Code, followed by the Corpus Juris Civilis (the Justinian Code). The Justinian Code went on to form the basis of law in most of Western Europe during the Middle Ages and so apostasy was similarly persecuted to varying degrees in Europe throughout this period and into the early modern period. Eastern Europe similarly inherited many of its legal traditions regarding apostasy from the Romans, but not from the Justinian Code. Medieval sects deemed heretical such as the Waldensians were considered apostates by the Church.

==Atrocity story==
The term atrocity story, also referred to as an atrocity tale, as it is defined by the American sociologists David G. Bromley and Anson D. Shupe refers to the symbolic presentation of action or events (real or imaginary) in such a context that they are made flagrantly to violate the (presumably) shared premises upon which a given set of social relationships should be conducted. The recounting of such tales is intended as a means of reaffirming normative boundaries. By sharing the reporter&#x27;s disapproval or horror, an audience reasserts normative prescription and clearly locates the violator beyond the limits of public morality. The term was coined in 1979 by Bromley, Shupe, and Joseph Ventimiglia.

Bromley and others define an atrocity as an event that is perceived as a flagrant violation of a fundamental value. It contains the following three elements:
# moral outrage or indignation;
# authorization of punitive measures;
# mobilization of control efforts against the apparent perpetrators.

The term &quot;atrocity story&quot; is controversial as it relates to the differing views amongst scholars about the credibility of the accounts of former members.

Bryan R. Wilson, Reader Emeritus of Sociology of the University of Oxford, says apostates of new religious movements are generally in need of self-justification, seeking to reconstruct their past and to excuse their former affiliations, while blaming those who were formerly their closest associates. Wilson, thus, challenges the reliability of the apostate&#x27;s testimony by saying that the apostate

and

Wilson also asserts that some apostates or defectors from religious organisations rehearse atrocity stories to explain how, by manipulation, coercion or deceit, they were recruited to groups that they now condemn.

Jean Duhaime of the Université de Montréal writes, referring to Wilson, based on his analysis of three books by apostates of new religious movements, that stories of apostates cannot be dismissed only because they are subjective.

Danny Jorgensen, Professor at the Department of Religious Studies of the University of Florida, in his book &quot;The Social Construction and Interpretation of Deviance: Jonestown and the Mass Media&quot; argues that the role of the media in constructing and reflecting reality is particularly apparent in its coverage of cults. He asserts that this complicity exists partly because apostates with an atrocity story to tell make themselves readily available to reporters and partly because new religious movements have learned to be suspicious of the media and, therefore, have not been open to investigative reporters writing stories on their movement from an insider&#x27;s perspective. Besides this lack of information about the experiences of people within new religious movements, the media is attracted to sensational stories featuring accusations of food and sleep deprivation, sexual and physical abuse, and excesses of spiritual and emotional authority by the charismatic leader.

Michael Langone argues that some will accept uncritically the positive reports of current members without calling such reports, for example, &quot;benevolence tales&quot; or &quot;personal growth tales&quot;. He asserts that only the critical reports of ex-members are called &quot;tales&quot;, which he considers to be a term that clearly implies falsehood or fiction. He states that it wasn&#x27;t until 1996 that a researcher conducted a study to assess the extent to which so called &quot;atrocity tales&quot; might be based on fact.

==Apostasy and contemporary criminal law==

Apostasy is a criminal offence in the following countries:
* Afghanistan – criminalized under Article 1 of the Afghan Penal Code, may be punishable by death.
* Brunei – criminalized under Section 112(1) of the Bruneian Syariah Penal Code, punishable by death. However, Brunei has a moratorium on the death penalty.
* Iran – while there are no provisions that criminalize apostasy in Iran, apostasy may be punishable by death under Iranian Sharia law, in accordance with Article 167 of the Iranian Constitution.
* Malaysia – while not criminalized on a federal level, apostasy is criminalized in six out of thirteen states: Kelantan, Malacca, Pahang, Penang, Sabah and Terengganu. In Kelantan and Terengganu, apostasy is punishable by death, but this is unenforceable due to restriction in federal law.
* Maldives – criminalized under Section 1205 of the Maldivian Penal Code, may be punishable by death.
* Mauritania – criminalized under Article 306 of the Mauritanian Penal Code, punishable by death. When discovered, secret apostasy requires capital punishment, irrespective of repentance.
* Qatar – criminalized under Article 1 of the Qatari Penal Code, may be punishable by death.
* Saudi Arabia – while there is no penal code in Saudi Arabia, apostasy may be punishable by death under Saudi Sharia law.
* United Arab Emirates – criminalized under Article 158 of the Emirati Penal Code, may be punishable by death.
* Yemen – criminalized under Article 259 of the Yemeni Penal Code, punishable by death.

From 1985 to 2006, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom listed a total of four cases of execution for apostasy in the Muslim world: one in Sudan (1985), two in Iran (1989, 1998), and one in Saudi Arabia (1992).

== Baháʼí Faith ==

Both marginal and apostate Baháʼís have existed in the Baháʼí Faith community who are known as &quot;nāqeżīn&quot;.

Muslims often regard adherents of the Baháʼí Faith as apostates from Islam, and there have been cases in some Muslim countries where Baháʼís have been harassed and persecuted.

== Christianity ==
The Christian understanding of apostasy is &quot;a willful falling away from, or rebellion against, Christian &#x27;truth.&#x27; Apostasy is the rejection of Christ by one who has been a Christian ...&quot;, but the Reformed Churches teach that, in contrast to the conditional salvation of Lutheran, Roman Catholic, Methodist, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox theology, salvation cannot be lost once accepted (perseverance of the saints). 

&quot;Apostasy is the antonym of conversion; it is deconversion.&quot; B. J. Oropeza states that apostasy is a &quot;phenomenon that occurs when a religious follower or group of followers turn away from or otherwise repudiate the central beliefs and practices they once embraced in a respective religious community.&quot; The Ancient Greek noun ἀποστασία &quot;apostasia&quot; (&quot;rebellion, abandonment, state of apostasy, defection&quot;) is found only twice in the New Testament (Acts 21:21; 2 Thessalonians 2:3). However, &quot;the concept of apostasy is found throughout Scripture.&quot; &quot;The Dictionary of Biblical Imagery&quot; states that &quot;There are at least four distinct images in Scripture of the concept of apostasy. All connote an intentional defection from the faith.&quot; These images are: Rebellion; Turning Away; Falling Away; Adultery.
* Rebellion: &quot;In classical literature apostasia was used to denote a coup or defection. By extension the Septuagint always uses it to portray a rebellion against God (Joshua 22:22; 2 Chronicles 29:19).&quot;
* Turning away: &quot;Apostasy is also pictured as the heart turning away from God (Jeremiah 17:5–6) and righteousness (Ezekiel 3:20). In the OT it centers on Israel&#x27;s breaking covenant relationship with God through disobedience to the law (Jeremiah 2:19), especially following other gods (Judges 2:19) and practicing their immorality (Daniel 9:9–11) ... Following the Lord or journeying with him is one of the chief images of faithfulness in the Scriptures ... The ... Hebrew root (&quot;swr&quot;) is used to picture those who have turned away and ceased to follow God (&#x27;I am grieved that I have made Saul king, because he has turned away from me,&#x27; 1 Samuel 15:11) ... The image of turning away from the Lord, who is the rightful leader, and following behind false gods is the dominant image for apostasy in the OT.&quot;
* Falling away: &quot;The image of falling, with the sense of going to eternal destruction, is particularly evident in the New Testament ... In his [Christ&#x27;s] parable of the wise and foolish builder, in which the house built on sand falls with a crash in the midst of a storm (Matthew 7:24–27) ... he painted a highly memorable image of the dangers of falling spiritually.&quot;
* Adultery: One of the most common images for apostasy in the Old Testament is adultery. &quot;Apostasy is symbolized as Israel the faithless spouse turning away from Yahweh her marriage partner to pursue the advances of other gods (Jeremiah 2:1–3; Ezekiel 16) ... &#x27;Your children have forsaken me and sworn by gods that are not gods. I supplied all their needs, yet they committed adultery and thronged to the houses of prostitutes&#x27; (Jeremiah 5:7, NIV). Adultery is used most often to describe the horror of the betrayal and covenant breaking involved in idolatry. Like literal adultery it does include the idea of someone blinded by infatuation, in this case for an idol: &#x27;How I have been grieved by their adulterous hearts ... which have lusted after their idols&#x27; (Ezekiel 6:9).&quot;

Speaking with specific regard to apostasy in Christianity, Michael Fink writes:
Apostasy is certainly a biblical concept, but the implications of the teaching have been hotly debated. The debate has centered on the issue of apostasy and salvation. Based on the concept of God&#x27;s sovereign grace, some hold that, though true believers may stray, they never totally fall away. Others affirm that any who fall away were never really saved. Though they may have &quot;believed&quot; for a while, they never experienced regeneration. Still others argue that the biblical warnings against apostasy are real and that believers maintain the freedom, at least potentially, to reject God&#x27;s salvation.
In the recent past, in the Roman Catholic Church the word was also applied to the renunciation of monastic vows (&quot;apostasis a monachatu&quot;), and to the abandonment of the clerical profession for the life of the world (&quot;apostasis a clericatu&quot;) without necessarily amounting to a rejection of Christianity.

=== Penalties ===

Apostasy was one of the sins for which the early church imposed perpetual penance and excommunication. Christianity rejected the removal of heretics and apostates by force, leaving the final punishment to God. As a result, the first millennium saw only one single official execution of a heretic, the Priscillian case. Classical canon law viewed apostasy as distinct from heresy and schism. Apostasy &quot;a fide&quot;, defined as total repudiation of the Christian faith, was considered as different from a theological standpoint from heresy, but subject to the same penalty of death by fire by decretist jurists. The influential 13th-century theologian Hostiensis recognized three types of apostasy. The first was conversion to another faith, which was considered traitorous and could bring confiscation of property or even the death penalty. The second and third, which was punishable by expulsion from home and imprisonment, consisted of breaking major commandments and breaking the vows of religious orders, respectively.

A decretal by Boniface VIII classified apostates together with heretics with respect to the penalties incurred. Although it mentioned only apostate Jews explicitly, it was applied to all apostates, and the Spanish Inquisition used it to persecute both the Marrano Jews, who had been converted to Christianity by force, and to the Moriscos who had professed to convert to Christianity from Islam under pressure.

Temporal penalties for Christian apostates have fallen into disuse in the modern era.

=== Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses ===

Jehovah&#x27;s Witness publications define &quot;apostasy&quot; as the abandonment of the worship and service of God, constituting rebellion against God, or rejecting &quot;Jehovah&#x27;s organization&quot;. They apply the term to a range of conduct, including open dissent with the denomination&#x27;s doctrines, celebration of &quot;false religious holidays&quot; (including Christmas and Easter), and participation in activities and worship of other religions. A member of the denomination who is accused of apostasy is typically required to appear before a committee of elders that decides whether the individual is to be shunned by all congregants including immediate family members not living in the same home. Baptized individuals who leave the organization because they disagree with the denomination&#x27;s teachings are also regarded as apostates and are shunned.

Watch Tower Society literature describes apostates as &quot;mentally diseased&quot; individuals who can &quot;infect others with their disloyal teachings&quot;. Former members who are defined as apostates are said to have become part of the antichrist and are regarded as more reprehensible than non-Witnesses.

=== Latter-day Saints (Mormonism) ===

Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) are considered by church leadership to engage in apostasy when they publicly teach or espouse opinions and doctrines contrary to the teachings of the church, or act in clear and deliberate public opposition to the LDS Church, its doctrines and policies, or its leaders. This includes advocating for or practicing doctrines like those followed in apostate sects, such as plural marriage, more commonly known as polygamy. In such circumstances the church will frequently subject the non-conforming member to a church membership council which may result in membership restrictions (a temporary loss of church participation privileges) or membership withdrawal (a loss of church membership).

== Hinduism ==
Hinduism does not have a &quot;unified system of belief encoded in a declaration of faith or a creed&quot;, but is rather an umbrella term comprising the plurality of religious phenomena of India. In general Hinduism is more tolerant to apostasy than other faiths based on a scripture or commandments with a lower emphasis on orthodoxy and has a more open view on how a person chooses their faith. Some Hindu sects believe that ethical conversion, without force or reward is completely acceptable, though deserting ones clan guru is considered sinful (Guru droham).

The Vashistha Dharmasastra, the Apastamba Dharmasutra and Yajnavalkya state that a son of an apostate is also considered an apostate. Smr̥ticandrikā lists apostates as one group of people upon touching whom, one should take a bath. Kātyāyana condemns a Brahmin who has apostatised to banishment while a Vaishya or a Shudra to serve the king as a slave. Nāradasmṛti and Parasara-samhita states that a wife can remarry if her husband becomes an apostate. The saint Parashara commented that religious rites are disturbed if an apostate witnesses them. He also comments that those who forgo the Rig Veda, Samaveda and Yajurveda are &quot;nagna&quot; (naked) or an apostate.

== Buddhism ==

Apostasy is generally not acknowledged in orthodox Buddhism. People are free to leave Buddhism and renounce the religion without any consequence enacted by the Buddhist community.

Despite this marked tolerance, some Buddhist circles hold to a notion of heresy (外道, pinyin: &quot;Wàidào&quot;; romaji: &quot;gedō&quot;; lit. &quot;outside path&quot;) and teach that one who renounces the Buddha&#x27;s teachings has the potential of inflicting suffering on themselves.

Many Buddhists take the view that there is no absolute basis for anything. The ideas from some of the Tathāgata schools has been referred to as &quot;hypostasising an absolute&quot;, meaning specifically not apostasy (losing belief); hypostasy in that context means &quot;falling into belief&quot;.

== Islam ==

In Islamic literature, apostasy is called &quot;irtidād&quot; or &quot;ridda&quot;; an apostate is called &quot;murtadd&quot;, which literally means &#x27;one who turns back&#x27; from Islam. Someone born to a Muslim parent, or who has previously converted to Islam, becomes a &quot;murtadd&quot; if he or she verbally denies any principle of belief prescribed by the Quran or a Hadith, deviates from approved Islamic belief (&quot;ilhad&quot;), or if he or she commits an action such as treating a copy of the Qurʾan with disrespect. A person born to a Muslim parent who later rejects Islam is called a &quot;murtad fitri&quot;, and a person who converted to Islam and later rejects the religion is called a &quot;murtad milli&quot;.

=== Origin ===
There are multiple verses in the Quran that condemn apostasy. In addition, there are multiple verses in the Hadith that condemn apostasy. Example quote from the Quran: 

The concept and punishment of Apostasy has been extensively covered in Islamic literature since the 7th century. A person is considered apostate if he or she converts from Islam to another religion. A person is an apostate even if he or she believes in most of Islam, but denies one or more of its principles or precepts, both verbally or in writing. 

Sunan an-Nasa&#x27;i »The Book of Fighting [The Prohibition of Bloodshed] – كتاب تحريم الدم (14) Chapter: The Ruling on Apostates (14)باب الْحُكْمِ فِي الْمُرْتَدِّ Ibn &#x27;Abbas said: &quot;The Messenger of Allah [SAW] said: &#x27;Whoever changes his religion, kill him.&#x27;&quot;Grade: Sahih (Darussalam) Reference : Sunan an-Nasa&#x27;i 4059 In-book reference : Book 37, Hadith 94 English translation Vol. 5, Book 37, Hadith 4064.

Muslim historians recognize 632 AD as the year when the first regional apostasy from Islam emerged, immediately after the death of Muhammed. The civil wars that followed are now called the Riddah wars (Wars of Islamic Apostasy).

Doubting the existence of Allah, making offerings to and worshipping an idol, a stupa or any other image of God, confesses a belief in the rebirth or incarnation of God, disrespecting the Quran or Islam&#x27;s Prophets are all considered sufficient evidence of apostasy.

According to some scholars, if a Muslim consciously and without coercion declares their rejection of Islam and does not change their mind after the time allocated by a judge for research, then the penalty for apostasy is; for males, death, and for females, life imprisonment. However, a Federal Sharia court judge in Pakistan stated &quot;...persecuting any citizen of an Islamic Statewhether he is a Muslim, or a dhimmi**is construed as waging a war against Allah and His Messenger.&quot;

=== Public opinion ===
According to the Ahmadiyya Muslim sect, there is no punishment for apostasy, neither in the Quran nor as it was taught by Muhammad. The Ahmadiyya Muslim sect&#x27;s position is not widely accepted by clerics in other sects of Islam, and the Ahmadiyya sect of Islam acknowledges that major sects have a different interpretation and definition of apostasy in Islam. Ulama of major sects of Islam consider the Ahmadi Muslim sect as &quot;kafirs&quot; (infidels) and apostates.

=== Apostasy laws ===
Apostasy is subject to the death penalty in some countries, such as Iran and Saudi Arabia, although executions for apostasy are rare. Apostasy is legal in secular Muslim countries such as Turkey. In numerous Islamic majority countries, many individuals have been arrested and punished for the crime of apostasy without any associated capital crimes.

In an effort to circumvent the United Nations Commission on Human Rights&#x27;s ruling on an individual&#x27;s right to conversion from and denunciation of a religion, some offenders of the ruling have argued that their &quot;obligations to Islam are irreconcilable with international law.&quot; United Nations Special Rapporteur Heiner Bielefeldt recommended to the United Nations Human Rights Council on the issues of freedom of religion or belief that &quot;States should repeal any criminal law provisions that penalize apostasy, blasphemy and proselytism as they may prevent persons belonging to religious or belief minorities from fully enjoying their freedom of religion or belief.&quot;

Many Muslims consider the Islamic law on apostasy and the punishment for it to be one of the immutable laws under Islam. It is a &quot;hudud&quot; crime, which means it is a crime against God, and the punishment has been fixed by God. The punishment for apostasy includes state enforced annulment of his or her marriage, seizure of the person&#x27;s children and property with automatic assignment to guardians and heirs, and death for the apostate.

=== Public opinion ===
According to a Pew Research study up to 15% of Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Russia, Kosovo, Albania, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan were in favor of a death penalty for converts, 15–30% in Turkey, Thailand, Tajikistan, and Tunisia, 30–50% in Bangladesh, Lebanon, and Iraq, and 50–86% in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Palestine, Jordan, and Egypt. The study included percentages only for Muslims in favor of sharia law and did not include Azerbaijan because it had a small sample size. A similar survey of the Muslim population in the United Kingdom, in 2007, found nearly a third of 16 to 24-year-old faithful believed that Muslims who convert to another religion should be executed, while less than a fifth of those over 55 believed the same. There is disagreement among contemporary Islamic scholars about whether the death penalty is an appropriate punishment for apostasy in the 21st century. A belief among more liberal Islamic scholars is that the apostasy laws were created and are still implemented as a means to consolidate &quot;religio-political&quot; power.

== Judaism ==

The term apostasy is derived from Ancient Greek ἀποστασία from ἀποστάτης, meaning &quot;political rebel&quot;, as applied to rebellion against God, its law and the faith of Israel (in Hebrew מרד) in the Hebrew Bible. Other expressions for apostate as used by rabbinical scholars are &quot;mumar&quot; (מומר, literally &quot;the one that is changed&quot;) and &quot;poshea yisrael&quot; (פושע ישראל, literally, &quot;transgressor of Israel&quot;), or simply &quot;kofer&quot; (כופר, literally &quot;denier&quot; and heretic).

The Torah states:
In 1 Kings King Solomon is warned in a dream which &quot;darkly portray[s] the ruin that would be caused by departure from God&quot;:

The prophetic writings of Isaiah and Jeremiah provide many examples of defections of faith found among the Israelites (e.g., Isaiah 1:2–4 or Jeremiah 2:19), as do the writings of the prophet Ezekiel (e.g., Ezekiel 16 or 18). Israelite kings were often guilty of apostasy, examples including Ahab (I Kings 16:30–33), Ahaziah (I Kings 22:51–53), Jehoram (2 Chronicles 21:6, 10), Ahaz (2 Chronicles 28:1–4), or Amon (2 Chronicles 33:21–23) among others. Amon&#x27;s father Manasseh was also apostate for many years of his long reign, although towards the end of his life he renounced his apostasy (cf. 2 Chronicles 33:1–19).

In the Talmud, Elisha ben Abuyah is singled out as an apostate and &quot;Epikoros&quot; (Epicurean) by the Pharisees.

During the Spanish Inquisition, a systematic conversion of Jews to Christianity took place to avoid expulsion from the crowns of Castille and Aragon as had been the case previously elsewhere in medieval Europe. Although the vast majority of &quot;conversos&quot; simply assimilated into the Catholic dominant culture, a minority continued to practice Judaism in secret, gradually migrated throughout Europe, North Africa, and the Ottoman Empire, mainly to areas where Sephardic communities were already present as a result of the Alhambra Decree. Tens of thousands of Jews were baptised in the three months before the deadline for expulsion, some 40,000 if one accepts the totals given by Kamen, most of these undoubtedly to avoid expulsion, rather than as a sincere change of faith. These &quot;conversos&quot; were the principal concern of the Inquisition; being suspected of continuing to practice Judaism put them at risk of denunciation and trial.

Several notorious Inquisitors, such as Tomás de Torquemada, and Don Francisco the archbishop of Coria, were descendants of apostate Jews. Other apostates who made their mark in history by attempting the conversion of other Jews in the 14th century include Juan de Valladolid and Astruc Remoch.

Abraham Isaac Kook, first Chief Rabbi of the Jewish community in Palestine, held that atheists were not actually denying God: rather, they were denying one of man&#x27;s many images of God. Since any man-made image of God can be considered an idol, Kook held that, in practice, one could consider atheists as helping true religion burn away false images of god, thus in the end serving the purpose of true monotheism.

Medieval Judaism was more lenient toward apostasy than the other monotheistic religions. According to Maimonides, converts to other faiths were to be regarded as sinners, but still Jewish. Forced converts were subject to special prayers and Rashi admonished those who rebuked or humiliated them.

There is no punishment today for leaving Judaism, other than being excluded from participating in the rituals of the Jewish community – including leading worship, Jewish marriage or divorce, being called to the Torah and being buried in a Jewish cemetery.

== Sikhism ==

Patit is a term in Sikhism for a Sikh who violates the Sikh Code of Conduct. The term is sometimes translated as apostate. Persecution of apostates is prohibited in Sikhism. An apostate can re-initiate into Sikhism by being &quot;tankhata&quot; (chastised) followed by re-going through the process of Amrit Sanskar. 

In Section Six of the Sikh Rehat Maryada (Code of Conduct), it states the four transgressions (&quot;kurahit&quot;) which lead to a Sikh becoming a &quot;patit&quot;.
* Dishonouring, shaving, cutting or trimming the hair;
* Eating the meat of an animal slaughtered by the Kutha method;
* Cohabiting with a person other than one&#x27;s spouse;
* Using intoxicants (such as smoking, drinking alcohol, using recreational drugs or tobacco)

These four transgressions which lead to apostasy were first listed by Guru Gobind Singh, the final human guru of Sikhs.

== Other religious movements ==
Controversies over new religious movements (NRMs) have often involved apostates, some of whom join organizations or web sites opposed to their former religions. A number of scholars have debated the reliability of apostates and their stories, often called &quot;apostate narratives&quot;.

The role of former members, or &quot;apostates&quot;, has been widely studied by social scientists. At times, these individuals become outspoken public critics of the groups they leave. Their motivations, the roles they play in the anti-cult movement, the validity of their testimony, and the kinds of narratives they construct, are controversial. Some scholars like David G. Bromley, Anson Shupe, and Brian R. Wilson have challenged the validity of the testimonies presented by critical former members. Wilson discusses the use of the atrocity story that is rehearsed by the apostate to explain how, by manipulation, coercion, or deceit, he was recruited to a group that he now condemns.

Sociologist Stuart A. Wright explores the distinction between the apostate narrative and the role of the apostate, asserting that the former follows a predictable pattern, in which the apostate uses a &quot;captivity narrative&quot; that emphasizes manipulation, entrapment and being victims of &quot;sinister cult practices&quot;. These narratives provide a rationale for a &quot;hostage-rescue&quot; motif, in which cults are likened to POW camps and deprogramming as heroic hostage rescue efforts. He also makes a distinction between &quot;leavetakers&quot; and &quot;apostates&quot;, asserting that despite the popular literature and lurid media accounts of stories of &quot;rescued or recovering &#x27;ex-cultists&#x27;&quot;, empirical studies of defectors from NRMs &quot;generally indicate favorable, sympathetic or at the very least mixed responses toward their former group&quot;.

One camp that broadly speaking questions apostate narratives includes David G. Bromley, Daniel Carson Johnson,
Dr. Lonnie D. Kliever (1932–2004), Gordon Melton, and Bryan R. Wilson. An opposing camp less critical of apostate narratives as a group includes Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi, Dr. Phillip Charles Lucas, Jean Duhaime, Mark Dunlop, Michael Langone, and Benjamin Zablocki.

Some scholars have attempted to classify apostates of NRMs. James T. Richardson proposes a theory related to a logical relationship between apostates and whistleblowers, using Bromley&#x27;s definitions, in which the former predates the latter. A person becomes an apostate and then seeks the role of whistleblower, which is then rewarded for playing that role by groups that are in conflict with the original group of membership such as anti-cult organizations. These organizations further cultivate the apostate, seeking to turn him or her into a whistleblower. He also describes how in this context, apostates&#x27; accusations of &quot;brainwashing&quot; are designed to attract perceptions of threats against the well-being of young adults on the part of their families to further establish their newfound role as whistleblowers. Armand L. Mauss, defines true apostates as those exiters that have access to oppositional organizations that sponsor their careers as such, and validate the retrospective accounts of their past and their outrageous experiences in new religionsmaking a distinction between these and whistleblowers or defectors in this context. Donald Richter, a current member of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS) writes that this can explain the writings of Carolyn Jessop and Flora Jessop, former members of the FLDS church who consistently sided with authorities when children of the YFZ ranch were removed over charges of child abuse.

Ronald Burks, a psychology assistant at the Wellspring Retreat and Resource Center, in a study comparing Group Psychological Abuse Scale (GPA) and Neurological Impairment Scale (NIS) scores in 132 former members of cults and cultic relationships, found a positive correlation between intensity of reform environment as measured by the GPA and cognitive impairment as measured by the NIS. Additional findings were a reduced earning potential in view of the education level that corroborates earlier studies of cult critics (Martin 1993; Singer &amp; Ofshe, 1990; West &amp; Martin, 1994) and significant levels of depression and dissociation agreeing with Conway &amp; Siegelman, (1982), Lewis &amp; Bromley, (1987) and Martin, et al. (1992). 
Sociologists Bromley and Hadden note a lack of empirical support for claimed consequences of having been a member of a &quot;cult&quot; or &quot;sect&quot;, and substantial empirical evidence against it. These include the fact that the overwhelming proportion of people who get involved in NRMs leave, most short of two years; the overwhelming proportion of people who leave do so of their own volition; and that two-thirds (67%) felt &quot;wiser for the experience&quot;.

According to F. Derks and psychologist of religion Jan van der Lans, there is no uniform post-cult trauma. While psychological and social problems upon resignation are not uncommon, their character and intensity are greatly dependent on the personal history and on the traits of the ex-member, and on the reasons for and way of resignation.

==Examples==
===Historical persons===

* Julian the Apostate (331/332363 CE), the Roman emperor, given a Christian education by those who assassinated his family, rejected his upbringing and declared his belief in Neoplatonism once it was safe to do so.
* Mindaugas, the first and only Christian king of Lithuania, accepted Christianity in 1251 but rejected it in 1261 to return to his pagan ways. It is believed that accepting Christianity was a political move on his part and thus after the victory at the battle of Durbe, the king&#x27;s nephew Treniota convinced him to reject Christianity.
* Sir Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford was declared &#x27;The Great Apostate&#x27; by Parliament in 1628 for changing his political support from Parliament to Charles I, thus shifting his religious support from Calvinism to Arminianism.
* Abraham ben Abraham, (Count Valentine (Valentin, Walentyn) Potocki), a Polish nobleman of the Potocki family who is claimed to have converted to Judaism and was burned at the stake in 1749 because he had renounced Catholicism and had become an observant Jew.
* Maria Monk (1816–1849), sometimes considered an apostate of the Catholic Church, though there is little evidence that she ever was a Catholic.
* Lord George Gordon, initially a zealous Protestant and instigator of the Gordon riots of 1780, finally renounced Christianity and converted to Judaism, for which he was ostracized.

=== Recent times ===

* In 2011, Youcef Nadarkhani, an Iranian pastor who converted from Islam to Christianity at the age of 19, was convicted for apostasy and was sentenced to death, but later acquitted.
* In 2013, Raif Badawi, a Saudi Arabian blogger, was found guilty of apostasy by the high court, which has a penalty of death. However he was not executed, but was imprisoned and punished by 600 lashes instead.
* In 2014, Meriam Yehya Ibrahim Ishag (a.k.a. Adraf Al-Hadi Mohammed Abdullah), a pregnant Sudanese woman, was convicted of apostasy for converting to Christianity from Islam. The government ruled that her father was Muslim, a female child takes the father&#x27;s religion under Sudan&#x27;s Islamic law. By converting to Christianity, she had committed apostasy, a crime punishable by death. Mrs Ibrahim Ishag was sentenced to death. She was also convicted of adultery on the grounds that her marriage to a Christian man from South Sudan was void under Sudan&#x27;s version of Islamic law, which says Muslim women cannot marry non-Muslims. The death sentence was not carried out, and she left Sudan in secret.
*Ashraf Fayadh (born 1980), a Saudi Arabian poet, was imprisoned and lashed for apostasy
* Tasleema Nasreen from Bangladesh, the author of &quot;Lajja&quot;, has been declared apostate – &quot;an apostate appointed by imperialist forces to vilify Islam&quot; – by several clerics and other Muslims in Dhaka.
* By 2019, atrocities by ISIL have driven many Muslim families in Syria to convert to Christianity, while others chose to become atheists and agnostics.

<doc id="50024" wikidata="Q6498477" url="?curid=50024" title="Lust">
<text>Lust is an intense desire for something. Lust can take any form such as the lust for sexuality (see libido), money, or power. It can take such mundane forms as the lust for food (see gluttony) as distinct from the need for food or lust for redolence, when one is lusting for a particular smell that brings back memories. It is similar to but distinguished from passion, in that properly ordered passion propels individuals to achieve benevolent goals whilst lust does not.

==In religion==

Religions tend to draw a distinction between passion and lust by further categorizing lust as an immoral desire and passion as morally accepted.

Lust is defined as immoral because its object or action of affection is improperly ordered according to natural law and/or the appetite for the particular object (eg sexual desire) is governing the person&#x27;s will and intellect rather than the will and intellect governing the appetite for that object.

Whereas passion, regardless of its strength, is maintained to be something God-given and moral, because the purpose, actions and intentions behind it are benevolent and ordered toward creation, while also being governed by the person&#x27;s intellect and will. A primary school of thought on this is Thomism, which speaks on the intellect, will and appetite, and draws from principles defined by Aristotle. However, the exact definitions assigned to what is morally definite and ordered toward creation depend on the religion. For example, religions based in pantheism and theism will differ on what is moral according to the nature of the &quot;God&quot; acknowledged or worshipped.

===Abrahamic religions===

====Judaism====
In Judaism, all evil inclinations and lusts of the flesh are characterized by &quot;Yetzer hara&quot; (Hebrew, יצר הרע, the evil inclination). Yetzer hara is not a demonic force; rather, it is man&#x27;s misuse of the things which the physical body needs to survive, and is often contrasted with &quot;yetzer hatov&quot; (Hebrew, יצר הטוב, the positive desire).

&quot;Yetzer Hara&quot; is often identified with Satan and the angel of death, and there is sometimes a tendency to give a personality and separate activity to the &quot;yetzer&quot;. For the &quot;yetzer&quot;, like Satan, misleads man in this world, and testifies against him in the world to come. The &quot;yetzer&quot; is, however, clearly distinguished from Satan, and on other occasions is made exactly parallel to sin. The Torah is considered the great antidote against this force. Though, like all things which God has made, the &quot;yetzer hara&quot; (evil inclination) can be manipulated into doing good: for without it, man would never marry, beget a child, build a house, or occupy himself in a trade.

====Christianity====
=====New Testament=====
In many translations of the New Testament, the word &quot;lust&quot; translates the Koine Greek word ἐπιθυμέω (epithūméō), particularly in Matthew 5:27-28:

In English-speaking countries, the term &quot;lust&quot; is often associated with sexual desire, probably because of this verse. However, just as the English word was originally a general term for &#x27;desire&#x27;, the Greek word ἐπιθυμέω was also a general term for desire. The LSJ lexicon suggests &quot;set one&#x27;s heart upon a thing, long for, covet, desire&quot; as glosses for ἐπιθυμέω, which is used in verses that clearly have nothing to do with sexual desire. In the Septuagint, &quot;ἐπιθυμέω&quot; is the word used in the commandment to not covet:

While coveting your neighbour&#x27;s wife may involve sexual desire, it&#x27;s unlikely that coveting a neighbour&#x27;s house or field is sexual in nature. And in most New Testament uses, the same Greek word, &quot;ἐπιθυμέω&quot;, does not have a clear sexual connotation. For example, from the American Standard Version the same word is used outside of any sexual connotation:

# : For verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men &quot;desired&quot; to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.
# : And he said unto them, With &quot;desire&quot; I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer: for I say unto you, I shall not eat it, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
# : I &quot;coveted&quot; no man&#x27;s silver, or gold, or apparel. Ye yourselves know that these hands ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.
# : And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want. And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he &quot;would fain&quot; have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.

=====Catholicism=====
According to the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, a Christian&#x27;s heart is lustful when &quot;venereal satisfaction is sought for either outside wedlock or, at any rate, in a manner which is contrary to the laws that govern marital intercourse&quot;. Pope John Paul II said that lust devalues the eternal attraction of male and female, reducing personal riches of the opposite sex to an object for gratification of sexuality.

Lust is considered by Catholicism to be a disordered desire for sexual pleasure, where sexual pleasure is &quot;sought for itself, isolated from its procreative and unitive purposes&quot;. In Catholicism, sexual desire in itself is good, and is considered part of God&#x27;s plan for humanity. However, when sexual desire is separated from God&#x27;s love, it becomes disordered and self-seeking. This is seen as lust.

St. Thomas Aquinas differentiates between sexual intercourse within marriage, which is seen as meritorious through giving justice to one&#x27;s spouse, and sins of lust which can themselves be differentiated in magnitude of immorality according to intention and action. For example, Aquinas says in the Summa Theologica II-II, q. 154, a. 12 &quot;I answer that, In every genus, worst of all is the corruption of the principle on which the rest depend. Now the principles of reason are those things that are according to nature, because reason presupposes things as determined by nature, before disposing of other things according as it is fitting.&quot; He uses St. Augustine as his source writing &quot;Augustine says that &#x27;of all these,&#x27; namely the sins belonging to lust, &#x27;that which is against nature is the worst.&#x27;&quot; Which St. Thomas clarifies means that they are greater than sins against justice pertaining to the genus of lust, such as rape or incest, in his statement &quot;Reply to Objection 3: The nature of the species is more intimately united to each individual, than any other individual is. Wherefore sins against the specific nature are more grievous.&quot; Thus St. Thomas gives the order of magnitude of lustful acts as: &quot;The most grievous is the sin of bestiality, because use of the due species is not observed...(Then) the sin of sodomy, because use of the right sex is not observed...(Then) the sin of not observing the right manner of copulation (or the unatural act or masturbation)... (Then) incest... is contrary to the natural respect which we owe persons related to us... Then, it is a greater injustice to have intercourse with a woman who is subject to another&#x27;s authority as regards the act of generation, than as regards merely her guardianship. Wherefore adultery is more grievous than seduction. And both of these are aggravated by the use of violence.&quot; 

The Latin for &quot;extravagance&quot; (Latin: &quot;luxuria&quot;) was used by St. Jerome to translate a variety of biblical sins, including drunkenness and sexual excess. Gregory the Great placed &quot;luxuria&quot; as one of the seven capital sins (it is often considered the least serious of the seven deadly sins), narrowing its scope to disordered desire, and it was in this sense that the Middle Ages generally took &quot;luxuria&quot;, (although the Old French cognate was adopted into English as &quot;luxury&quot; without its sexual meaning by the 14th century).

In Romanesque art, the personified Luxuria is generally feminine, often represented by a siren or a naked woman with breasts being bitten by snakes. Prudentius in his &quot;Psychomachia&quot; or &#x27;Battle of the Soul&#x27; had described

Luxury, lavish of her ruined fame, Loose-haired, wild-eyed, her voice a dying fall, Lost in delight...

For Dante, Luxuria was both the first of the circles of incontinence (or self-indulgence) on the descent into hell, and the last of the cornices of Mount Purgatory, representing the excessive (disordered) love of individuals; while for Edmund Spenser, &quot;luxuria&quot; was synonymous with the power of desire.

For Gregory and subsequent Thomists, the &#x27;daughters&#x27; (by-products) of Luxuria included mental blindness, self-love, haste, and excessive attachment to the present. Marianne Dashwood has been seen as embodying such characteristics for a later age – as a daughter of Luxuria.

The Catholic Church defines lust as the idolatry of sexual pleasure, in all of its forms: contraception, masturbation, adultery, premarital relations, relations between persons of the same sex, etc, which destroys the human capacity of loving, that is, of the person to give themselves to God and to others.

=====Protestantism=====

The evangelical Melvin Tinker states that: &quot;The principle is clear isn&#x27;t it, &#x27;You shall not commit adultery&#x27;? How does the Pharisee handle it according to the minimum requirement method? He says, &#x27;Sex outside marriage is OK for us because neither of us are really married. I am not sleeping with another man&#x27;s wife, so it isn&#x27;t adultery, she&#x27;s my girlfriend&#x27;. Or it is also not adultery because &#x27;I have not had sex with that woman.&#x27; to quote President Clinton&#x27;s plea in the Monica Lewinski [&quot;sic&quot;] saga. So he can abuse his position as President by messing around with a girl who is hardly younger than his daughter, he can engage in all kinds of sexual activities with her, but because he technically doesn&#x27;t have intercourse he can hold up his hands and say, &#x27;I have not had sex with that woman.&#x27; That is a Pharisee speaking.

&quot;But the maximum application method says, adultery doesn&#x27;t just happen when you have sexual intercourse, it happens in your heart. However, the mistranslation is unfortunate at this point. In the Greek it says, &#x27;If anyone looks upon a woman in order to lust, has already committed adultery with her in his heart.&#x27; That is an important distinction. I need to point that out because sexual arousal, sexual interest, sexual attraction are essential for the continuation of the human species. 

It is about looking in order to lust. The striptease show, the dirty movie or video, the internet pornography.

You see, it is the intending to look in order to have that arousal that Jesus has in his sights.&quot;

====Islam====
In Islam, lust is considered one of the primitive states of the self, called the &quot;nafs&quot;. In sufi psychology, according to Robert Frager, &quot;nafs&quot; is an aspect of psyche that begins as our worst adversary but can develop into an invaluable tool.

In the Quran there is a passage when Zuleikha admits that she sought to seduce prophet Joseph (Arabic: Yousuf), and then prophet Joseph said: &quot;&quot;Yet I claim not that my soul was innocent -- surely the soul of man [nafs] incites to evil -- except inasmuch as my Lord had mercy; truly my Lord is All-forgiving, All-compassionate&quot;.&quot; (Qur&#x27;an 12:53). Al-Ghazali, in his major works &quot;Ihya&#x27; Ulum al-Din&quot; (The Revival of Religious Sciences), stated that &quot;nafs&quot; in this passage is the lowest state of the soul, called &quot;nafs al-ammara&quot; (evil soul); while the other states of the soul are &quot;nafs al-mulhama&quot; (questioning soul), &quot;nafs al-lawwama&quot; (self-accusing soul), and &quot;nafs al-mutmainna&quot; (contented soul).

Muslims are encouraged to overcome their baser instincts and intentional lascivious glances are forbidden. Lascivious thoughts are disliked, for they are the first step towards adultery, rape and other antisocial behaviors. The Islamic prophet Muhammad also stressed the magnitude of the &quot;second glance&quot;, as while the first glance towards an attractive member of the opposite sex could be just accidental or observatory, the second glance could be that gate into lustful thinking.

===Indian religions===
====Hinduism====
In the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, Krishna, an Avatar of Vishnu, declared in chapter 16, verse 21 that lust is one of the gates to Naraka or hell.

In this ancient manuscript the idea behind the word &#x27;Lust&#x27; is best comprehended as the psychological force called &#x27;Wanting&#x27;.

====Buddhism====
Lust holds a critical position in the philosophical underpinnings of Buddhist reality. It is named in the second of the Four Noble Truths, which are that

# Suffering (dukkha) is inherent in all life.
# Suffering is caused by desire.
# There is a natural way to eliminate all suffering from one&#x27;s life.
# The ending of desire eliminates all suffering from someones life.

Lust is the attachment to, identification with, and passionate desire for certain things in existence, all of which relate to the form, sensation, perception, mentality, and consciousness that certain combinations of these things engender within us. Lust is thus the ultimate cause of general imperfection and the most immediate &quot;root&quot; cause of a certain suffering.

The passionate desire for either non-existence or for freedom from lust is a common misunderstanding. For example, the headlong pursuit of lust (or other &quot;deadly sin&quot;) in order to fulfill a desire for death is followed by a reincarnation accompanied by a self-fulfilling karma, resulting in an endless wheel of life, until the right way to live, the right worldview, is somehow discovered and practiced. Beholding an endless knot puts one, symbolically, in the position of the one with the right worldview, representing that person who attains freedom from lust.

In existence there are four kinds of things that engender clinging (attachment): rituals, worldviews, pleasures, and the self. The way to eliminate lust is to learn of its unintended effects and to pursue righteousness as concerns a worldview, intention, speech, behavior, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and concentration, in the place where lust formerly sat.

====Sikhism====
In Sikhism, lust is counted among the five cardinal sins or sinful propensities, the others being wrath, ego, greed and attachment. Uncontrollable expression of sexual lust, as in rape or sexual addiction, is an evil.

=== Indian spirituality ===

====Brahma Kumaris====
According to Brahma Kumaris, a spiritual organization which is based on Karmic philosophy, sexual lust is the greatest enemy to all mankind. 

For this reason followers do not eat onions, garlic, eggs, or non-vegetarian food, as the &quot;sulphur&quot; in them can excite sexual lust in the body, otherwise bound to celibacy.

The physical act of sex is &quot;impure&quot;, leading to body-consciousness and other crimes. This impurity &quot;poisons&quot; the body and leads to many kinds of &quot;diseases&quot;.

The Brahma Kumaris teaches that sexuality is foraging about in a dark sewer. Students at Spiritual University must conquer lust, to prevent sin, and in order to be closer to god.

They describe the differences between lust and love thus:

In lust there is reliance upon the object of sense and consequent spiritual subordination of the soul to it, but love puts the soul into direct and co-ordinate relation with the reality which is behind the form. Therefore, lust is experienced as being heavy and love is experienced as being light. In lust there is a narrowing down of life and in love there is an expansion in being...If you love the whole world you vicariously live in the whole world, but in lust there is an ebbing down of life and a general sense of hopeless dependence upon a form which is regarded as another. Thus, in lust there is the accentuation of separateness and suffering, but in love there is the feeling of unity and joy...

===Paganism===
The most famous example of a widespread religious movement practicing lechery as a ritual is the Bacchanalia of the Ancient Roman Bacchantes. However, this activity was soon outlawed by the Roman Senate in 186 BC in the decree &quot;Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus&quot;. The practice of sacred prostitution, however, continued to be an activity practiced often by the Dionysians.

==In culture==
===Medieval prostitutes===
Medieval prostitutes lived in officially sanctioned &quot;red light districts&quot;. In Ruth Mazo Karras&#x27; book &quot;Common Women&quot;, the author discusses the meaning of prostitution and how people thought the proper use of prostitutes by unmarried men helped contain male lust. Prostitution was thought to have a beneficial effect by reducing sexual frustration in the community. Inquisitors accused the Waldensians of believing that satisfying lust was better than being harassed by fleshly temptation.

== In art ==
=== Literature ===
From Ovid to the works of &quot;les poètes maudits&quot;, characters have always been faced with scenes of lechery, and for time out of mind lust has been a common motif in world literature. Many writers, such as Georges Bataille, Casanova and Prosper Mérimée, have written works wherein scenes take place at bordellos and other unseemly locales.

Baudelaire, author of &quot;Les fleurs du mal&quot;, had once remarked, in regard to the artist, that:

The most notable work to touch upon the sin of lust, (and also upon the other Seven Deadly Sins), is Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. Dante&#x27;s criterion for lust was an &quot;excessive love of others&quot;, insofar as an excessive love for man would render one&#x27;s love of God secondary. In the first canticle of the Divine Comedy—the Inferno—the lustful are punished by being continuously swept around in a whirlwind, symbolizing their ungovernable passions. The damned who are guilty of lust, like the two famous lovers, Paolo and Francesca, receive in Hell exactly what they desired most in their mortal lives, only to find that their passions will give them no rest for all eternity. In &quot;Purgatorio&quot;, of the selfsame work, the penitents choose to walk through flames in order to purge themselves of their lustful inclinations.

==In philosophy==
The link between love and lust has always been a problematic question in philosophy.

===Schopenhauer===
Schopenhauer notes the misery which results from sexual relationships. According to him, this directly explains the sentiments of shame and sadness which tend to follow the act of sexual intercourse; for, he states, the only power that reigns is the inextinguishable desire to face, at any price, the blind love present in human existence without any consideration of the outcome. He estimates that a genius of his species is an industrial being who wants only to produce, and wants only to think. The theme of lust for Schopenhauer is thus to consider the horrors which will almost certainly follow the culmination of lust.

===St Thomas Aquinas===
St Thomas Aquinas defines the sin of lust in questions 153 and 154 of his &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;. Aquinas says the sin of lust is of &quot;voluptuous emotions&quot;, and makes the point that sexual pleasures, &quot;unloosen the human spirit&quot;, and set aside right reason (p. 191). Aquinas restricts lust&#x27;s subject matter to physical desires specifically arising from sexual acts, but he does not assume all sex-acts are sinful. Sex is not a sin in marriage, because sex is the only way for humans to reproduce. If sex is used naturally and the end purpose is reproduction there is no sin. Aquinas says, &quot;if the end be good and if what is done is well-adapted to that, then no sin is present&quot; (p. 193). However, sex simply for the sake of pleasure is lustful, and therefore a sin. A man who uses his body for lechery wrongs the Lord.

Sex may have the attributes of being sinless; however, when a person seeks sex for pleasure, he or she is sinning with lust. Lust is best defined by its specific attribute of rape, adultery, wet dreams, seduction, unnatural vice, and simple fornication.

Wet dreams: St Thomas Aquinas defined and discussed the topic of nocturnal emission, which occurs when one dreams of physical pleasure. Aquinas argues those who say that wet dreams are a sin and comparable to the actual experience of sex are wrong. Aquinas believes that such an action is sinless, for a dream is not under a person&#x27;s control or free judgment. When one has a &quot;nocturnal orgasm&quot;, it is not a sin, but it can lead to sins (p. 227). Aquinas says that wet dreams come from a physical cause of inappropriate pictures within your imagination, a psychological cause when thinking of sex while you fall asleep and a demonical cause whereby demons act upon the sleeper&#x27;s body, &quot;stirring the sleeper&#x27;s imagination to bring about a orgasm&quot; (p. 225). In the end, though, dreaming of lustful acts is not sinful. The &quot;mind&#x27;s awareness is less hindered&quot;, as the sleeper lacks right reason; therefore, a person cannot be accountable for what they dream while sleeping (p. 227).

Adultery: One of the main forms of lust seen frequently during the Middle Ages was the sin of adultery. The sin of adultery occurs when a person is unfaithful to his or her spouse, hence &quot;invading of a bed not one&#x27;s own&quot; (p. 235). Adultery is a special kind of ugliness and many difficulties arise from it. When a man enters the bed of a married woman it not only is a sin, but it &quot;wrongs the offspring&quot;, because the woman now calls into question the legitimacy of children (p. 235). If a wife has committed adultery before, then, her husband will question if all his wife&#x27;s children are his offspring. 
Simple fornication: Simple fornication is having sex with one&#x27;s spouse for enjoyment rather than for bearing children. Fornication is also sex between two unmarried people, which is also a mortal sin. Aquinas says that &quot;fornication is a deadly crime&quot; (p. 213). Fornication is a mortal sin, but as Aquinas notes, &quot;Pope Gregory treated sins of the flesh as less grievous than those of the spirit&quot; (p. 217). Fornication was a grave sin such as that against property. Fornication, however, is not as grave as a sin directly against God and human life; therefore, murder is much worse than fornication. Property in this case means that a daughter is the property of her father, and if one does wrong to her, one then does wrong to him; therefore seducing a virgin or seeking pleasure from an unmarried woman is an invasion of a father&#x27;s property.

Seduction: Seduction is a type of lust, because seduction is a sex act, which ravishes a virgin. Lust is a sin of sexual activity, and &quot;...a special quality of wrong that appears if a maid still under her father&#x27;s care is debauched&quot; (p. 229). Seduction involves a discussion of property, as an unmarried girl is property of her father. A virgin, even though free from the bond of marriage, is not free from the bond of her family. When a virgin is violated without a promise of engagement, she is prevented from having honorable marriage, which is shameful to herself and her family. A man who performs sexual acts with a virgin must &quot;endow her and have her to wife&quot;, and if the father, who is responsible for her, says no, then a man must pay a dowry to compensate for her loss of virginity and future chance of marriage (p. 229).

Unnatural vice: Unnatural vice is the worst kind of lust because it is unnatural in act and purpose. Many varieties of unnatural vice exist; Aquinas provides several examples, including bestiality or intercourse with a &quot;thing of another species&quot; (for example, an animal), incest, sodomy and &quot;not observing the right manner of copulation&quot;.

==In psychoanalysis and psychology==
Lust, in the domain of psychoanalysis and psychology, is often treated as a case of &quot;heightened libido&quot;.

<text>The Bay of Pigs () is an inlet of the Gulf of Cazones, located on the southern coast of Cuba. By 1910 it was included in Santa Clara Province, and then to Las Villas Province by 1961, but in 1976, it was reassigned to Matanzas Province, when the original six provinces of Cuba were re-organized into 14 new Provinces of Cuba.

The bay is historically important for the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1961. The area is a site known for its diving, with an abundance of marine fauna, e.g. 30 species of sponges belonging to 19 families and 21 genera, to be found in the bay.

== Etymology ==
In Cuban Spanish, &quot;cochinos&quot; may also mean the queen triggerfish (&quot;Balistes vetula&quot;), which inhabit coral reefs in Bahía de Cochinos, in addition to the literal meaning, pigs (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;). 

== Geography ==

This bay is approximately south of Jagüey Grande, west of the city of Cienfuegos, and southeast from the capital city Havana. On the western side of the bay, coral reefs border the main Zapata Swamp, part of the Zapata Peninsula. On the eastern side, beaches border margins of firm ground with mangroves and extensive areas of swampland to the north and east. At the north end of the bay, the village of Buena Ventura is adjacent to Playa Larga (Long Beach). southeast of that, Playa Girón (Giron Beach) at the village of Girón, named after the notorious French pirate Gilberto Giron (c. 1604).

== History ==

Playa Girón and Playa Larga were the landing sites for seaborne forces of armed Cuban exiles and the land strip for some American planes (but not many as America did not want Cuba to realize that it was American sponsored) in the Bay of Pigs Invasion, an American CIA-sponsored attempt to overthrow the new government of Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro in April 1961.

According to Fidel Castro&#x27;s former bodyguard, the late Juan Reinaldo Sánchez, Castro lived in great luxury and had a private island called Cayo Piedra in the Bay of Pigs, replete with &quot;mansions, guest houses, a heliport, dolphinarium, turtle lagoon, his luxury yacht &quot;Aquarama&quot; – a gift from Leonid Brezhnev – and deep-sea fishing speedboat&quot;.

== Diving ==

The Bay of Pigs is a relatively quiet site for diving. Dive centers exist in Playa Larga, Playa Girón and Caleta Buena. Twelve dive sites in the bay display excellent visibility of , an average water temperature of in December and in July. Walls of coral, caverns, and a variety of fish (including the barracuda, lionfish, and groupers, among others), coral, and sponges can be found in the Bay of Pigs.

The Caves of the Fishes (), with depth the deepest cenote of Cuba, is located at south of Playa Larga.

=== Biodiversity ===
Surrounding the Bay of Pigs, the endemic wormlizards &quot;Amphisbaena barbouri&quot; and &quot;A. cubana&quot; have been noted. The following marine species have been registered along the eastern coast of the Bay of Pigs:

<text>&quot;La Marseillaise&quot; is the national anthem of France. It was written in 1792 by Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle in Strasbourg after the declaration of war by the First French Republic against Austria, and was originally titled &quot;&quot;.

The French National Convention adopted it as the First Republic&#x27;s anthem in 1795. The song acquired its nickname after being sung in Paris by Fédéré (volunteers) from Marseille marching to the capital. The song is the first example of the &quot;European march&quot; anthemic style. The anthem&#x27;s evocative melody and lyrics have led to its widespread use as a song of revolution and its incorporation into many pieces of classical and popular music.

The Italian violinist Guido Rimonda pointed out in 2013 that the incipit of &quot;Tema e variazioni in Do maggiore&quot; of Giovanni Battista Viotti has a strong resemblance to the anthem. This incipit was first thought to have been published before La Marseillaise, but it appeared to be a misconception as Viotti published several variations of &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; in 1795 and wrote as a note &quot;I have never composed the quartets below&quot; ().

== History ==
As the French Revolution continued, the monarchies of Europe became concerned that revolutionary fervor would spread to their countries. The War of the First Coalition was an effort to stop the revolution, or at least contain it to France. Initially, the French army did not distinguish itself, and Coalition armies invaded France. On 25 April 1792, Baron Philippe-Frédéric de Dietrich, the Mayor of Strasbourg and Worshipful Master of the local Masonic lodge, asked his Freemason guest Rouget de Lisle to compose a song &quot;that will rally our soldiers from all over to defend their homeland that is under threat&quot;. That evening, Rouget de Lisle wrote &quot;&quot; (&quot;War Song for the Army of the Rhine&quot;), and dedicated the song to Marshal Nicolas Luckner, a Bavarian freemason in French service from Cham. A plaque on the building on Place Broglie where De Dietrich&#x27;s house once stood commemorates the event. De Dietrich was executed the next year during the Reign of Terror.

The melody soon became the rallying call to the French Revolution and was adopted as &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; after the melody was first sung on the streets by volunteers (&quot;fédérés&quot; in French) from Marseille by the end of May. These &quot;fédérés&quot; were making their entrance into the city of Paris on 30 July 1792 after a young volunteer from Montpellier called François Mireur had sung it at a patriotic gathering in Marseille, and the troops adopted it as the marching song of the National Guard of Marseille. A newly graduated medical doctor, Mireur later became a general under Napoléon Bonaparte and died in Egypt at age 28.

The song&#x27;s lyrics reflect the invasion of France by foreign armies (from Prussia and Austria) that was under way when it was written. Strasbourg itself was attacked just a few days later. The invading forces were repulsed from France following their defeat in the Battle of Valmy. As the vast majority of Alsatians did not speak French, a German version („Auf, Brüder, auf dem Tag entgegen&quot;) was published in October 1792 in Colmar.
The Convention accepted it as the French national anthem in a decree passed on 14 July 1795, making it France&#x27;s first anthem. It later lost this status under Napoleon I, and the song was banned outright by Louis XVIII and Charles X, being re-instated only briefly after the July Revolution of 1830. During Napoleon I&#x27;s reign, &quot;Veillons au salut de l&#x27;Empire&quot; was the unofficial anthem of the regime, and in Napoleon III&#x27;s reign, it was &quot;Partant pour la Syrie&quot;, but the government brought back the iconic anthem in an attempt to motivate the French people during the Franco-Prussian War. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; was recognized as the anthem of the international revolutionary movement; as such, it was adopted by the Paris Commune in 1871, albeit with new lyrics under the title &quot;La Marseillaise de la Commune&quot;. Eight years later, in 1879, it was restored as France&#x27;s national anthem, and has remained so ever since.

=== Music ===
Several musical antecedents have been cited for the melody:

* &quot;Tema e variazioni in Do maggiore&quot;, a work by the Italian violinist Giovanni Battista Viotti; the 1781 dating of the manuscript has been questioned, but it seems to have been published after &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, in 1795.
* Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Allegro maestoso&quot; from the Piano Concerto No. 25 (composed in 1786).
* The oratorio &quot;Esther&quot; by Jean Baptiste Lucien Grison (composed in 1787).

Other attributions (the &quot;credo&quot; of the fourth Mass of Holtzmann of Mursberg) have been refuted.

== Lyrics ==
Generally only the first verse is sung.

== Cultural impact and musical adaptations ==
&quot;La Marseillaise&quot; was arranged for soprano, chorus and orchestra by Hector Berlioz in about 1830.

Franz Liszt wrote a piano transcription of the anthem.

During World War I, bandleader James Reese Europe played a jazz version of &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;.

The anthem was used as a protest song in the Korean March First Movement protests against Japanese rule in 1919.

=== Adaptations in other musical works ===
* Robert Schumann uses a brief quote of &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; in his solo piano work&#x27;s &quot;Faschingsschwank aus Wien&quot; (1839) first movement, &quot;Allegro&quot;. Singing &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; was forbidden in Austria at the time because &quot;such a revolutionary piece might cause public disorder&quot;.
* Schumann also quotes the melody in the last verse of his song &quot;Die beiden grenadiere&quot; Op. 49 no. 1 (1840)
* Richard Wagner quotes the melody in last verse of his &quot;Les deux grenadiers&quot; (1840)
* Thomas Wiggins quotes the melody in his &quot;Battle of Manassas&quot; (ca 1861)
* Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky quotes &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; in his &quot;1812 Overture&quot; (1880), representing the invading French Army under Napoleon (although it had not been the French national anthem at that time), and it is drowned out by cannon fire, symbolizing the Russian defense at the Battle of Borodino.
* Pavlos Carrer quotes the tune in the overture to his opera Maria Antonietta (1884)
* Julián Felipe incorporated elements of &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; in the fifth and last bar of his incidental piece &quot;Marcha Filipina-Magdalo&quot; (1898) which eventually became the Filipino national anthem &quot;Lupang Hinirang&quot;.
* Erik Satie&#x27;s song &quot;Un Dîner à l&#x27;Élysée&quot; quotes the tune
* The anthem has been sampled to reference France or Paris in countless film scores
* Dmitri Shostakovich quotes &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; at some length during the fifth reel of the film score he composed for the 1929 silent movie &quot;The New Babylon&quot; (set during the Paris Commune), where it is juxtaposed contrapuntally with the &quot;Infernal Galop&quot; from Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot;.
* The Australian rules football team the Brisbane Lions use the melody of &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; in their club song, which their predecessor, the Fitzroy Lions, adopted in 1952.
* The Beatles&#x27; 1967 single &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; uses the opening bars of &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; as an introduction.
* On Simchat Torah (18–19 October) 1973, the Lubavitcher Rebbe adapted the melody to the Jewish prayer &quot;HaAderet v&#x27;HaEmunah&quot;. In Chabad, the melody is believed to convey the idea of a &quot;spiritual French revolution&quot; – in that Torah should be spread around the world as an advent to the Messianic era.
* Sarah Schachner used and reinterpreted the melody of &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; in the track &quot;Rather Death Than Slavery&quot; that is included in the official soundtrack to the video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Unity&quot; (2014), itself set during the French Revolution. This track was also used in 2015 in a trailer for season 5 of the TV drama &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;.

=== Historical Russian use ===
In Russia, &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; was used as a republican revolutionary anthem by those who knew French starting in the 18th century, almost simultaneously with its adoption in France. In 1875 Peter Lavrov, a narodnik revolutionary and theorist, wrote a Russian-language text (not a translation of the French one) to the same melody. This &quot;Worker&#x27;s Marseillaise&quot; became one of the most popular revolutionary songs in Russia and was used in the Revolution of 1905. After the February Revolution of 1917, it was used as the semi-official national anthem of the new Russian republic. Even after the October Revolution, it remained in use for a while alongside &quot;The Internationale&quot;.

== Critique ==
The English philosopher and reformer Jeremy Bentham, who was declared an honorary citizen of France in 1791 in recognition of his sympathies for the ideals of the French Revolution, was not enamoured of &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;. Contrasting its qualities with the &quot;beauty&quot; and &quot;simplicity&quot; of &quot;God Save the King&quot;, he wrote in 1796:

The War whoop of anarchy, the Marseillais Hymn, is to my ear, I must confess, independently of all moral association, a most dismal, flat, and unpleasing ditty: and to any ear it is at any rate a long winded and complicated one. In the instance of a melody so mischievous in its application, it is a fortunate incident, if, in itself, it should be doomed neither in point of universality, nor permanence, to gain equal hold on the affections of the people.

Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, President of France for most of the 1970s, said that it is ridiculous to sing about drenching French fields with impure Prussian blood as a Chancellor of the modern democratic Germany takes the salute in Paris. A 1992 campaign to change the words of the song involving more than 100 prominent French citizens, including Danielle Mitterrand, wife of then-President François Mitterrand, was unsuccessful.

The British historian Simon Schama discussed &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme on 17 November 2015 (in the immediate aftermath of the Paris attacks), saying it was &quot;... the great example of courage and solidarity when facing danger; that&#x27;s why it is so invigorating, that&#x27;s why it really is the greatest national anthem in the world, ever. Most national anthems are pompous, brassy, ceremonious, but this is genuinely thrilling. Very important in the song ... is the line &#x27;before us is tyranny, the bloody standard of tyranny has risen&#x27;. There is no more ferocious tyranny right now than ISIS, so it&#x27;s extremely easy for the tragically and desperately grieving French to identify with that&quot;.

In 1979, a reggae version, &quot;Aux armes et cætera&quot; by Serge Gainsbourg, was received poorly by some in France, particularly in &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, where Michel Droit accused Gainsbourg of making money from the national anthem and suggesting that he was feeding antisemitism. Gainsbourg was also criticised for removing some of the military-focused aspects of the song.

<text>Year 1 BC was a common year starting on Friday or Saturday in the Julian calendar (the sources differ; see leap year error for further information) and a leap year starting on Thursday in the proleptic Julian calendar. It was also a leap year starting on Saturday in the Proleptic Gregorian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the [[Consulship]] of [[Cossus Cornelius Lentulus Gaetulicus|Lentulus]] and [[Calpurnia gens#Calpurnii_Pisones|Piso]] (or, less frequently, year 753 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 1 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. The following year is AD 1 in the widely used Julian calendar and the proleptic Gregorian calendar, which both do not have a &quot;year zero&quot;.

== Events ==

==== Han dynasty ====
* August 15 – Emperor Ai dies and is succeeded by his 8-year-old cousin Ping, who is enthroned on October 17. Wang Mang is appointed regent by Empress Dowager Wang Zhengjun, his aunt.
* Former regent Dong Xian, who was previously Ai&#x27;s lover, commits suicide with his wife.

==== Roman Empire ====

==== Kingdom of Kush ====
* The approximate date of Natakamani succeeding Amanishakheto as the King of Kush.

==== Satavahana dynasty ====
*Kunatala Satakarni is succeeded by Satakarni III.

=== By topic ===
==== Religion ====

* Estimated birth of Jesus, in the Christian religion, as assigned by Dionysius Exiguus in his Anno Domini era; according to most scholars, Dionysius used the word &quot;incarnation&quot;, but it is not known whether he meant conception or birth. However, at least one scholar thinks Dionysius placed the incarnation of Jesus in the next year, AD 1. Most modern scholars do not consider Dionysius&#x27; calculations authoritative, and place the event several years earlier.
== Deaths ==
* August 15 – Ai of Han, Chinese emperor of the Han dynasty (b. 27 BC)
* Dong Xian, Chinese politician and commander-in-chief (b. 23 BC)
* Xiaoai, Chinese empress and wife of Ai of Han

<text>Back of Keppoch (Gaelic: &quot;Cùl na Ceapaich&quot;) is a small coastal settlement in the northwest Scottish Highlands, west of Fort William near to the A830 road to Mallaig.

The Back of Keppoch is north of Arisaig and south of Morar. Most of the houses on this road are crofts and their land is used as campsites in the summer months. A number of beaches line the road.
