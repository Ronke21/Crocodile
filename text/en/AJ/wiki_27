<text>Swansea ( ; ) is a coastal city and the second-largest city of Wales. It forms a principal area, officially known as the City and County of Swansea ().

The city is the twenty-fifth largest in the United Kingdom. Located along Swansea Bay in south-west Wales, with the principal area covering the Gower Peninsula, it is part of the Swansea Bay region and part of the historic county of Glamorgan and the ancient Welsh commote of Gŵyr.

The principal area is the second most populous local authority area in Wales, with an estimated population of in . Swansea, along with Neath and Port Talbot, forms the Swansea Urban Area, with a population of 300,352 in 2011. It is also part of the Swansea Bay City Region.

During the 19th-century industrial heyday, Swansea was the key centre of the copper-smelting industry, earning the nickname &quot;Copperopolis&quot;.

== Etymologies ==
The Welsh name, &quot;Abertawe&quot;, translates as &quot;mouth/estuary of the Tawe&quot; and this name was likely used for the area before a settlement was established. The first written record of the Welsh name for the town itself dates from 1150 and appears in the form &quot;Aper Tyui&quot;.

The name &quot;Swansea&quot;, pronounced (Swans-ee, not Swan-sea), is derived from the Old Norse name of the original Viking trading post that was founded by King Sweyn Forkbeard (–1014). It was the name of the king, &#x27;Svein&#x27; or &#x27;Sweyn&#x27;, with the suffix of &#x27;-ey&#x27; (&quot;island&quot;), referring either to a bank of the river at its mouth or to an area of raised ground in marshland. However, the Norse termination &quot;-ey&quot; can mean &quot;inlet&quot;, and the name may simply refer to the mouth of the river.

==History==
===Ancient history===
The area around Swansea has a unique archaeological history dating back to the Palaeolithic. Finds at Long Hole Cave on the Gower Peninsula have been interpreted as those of the first modern humans in Britain, and the same area is also home to the oldest ceremonial burial in Western Europe, discovered at Paviland in 1823 and dated to 22,000 BC. The area also has many Bronze Age and Iron Age sites, such as the burial mound at Cillibion and the hill fort at Cil Ifor. There are also the remains of a Roman villa also on the Gower peninsula.

===Medieval Swansea===
The area that would become Swansea was known as the Cantref Eginog in ancient times, located on the eastern edge of the cwmwd (commote) of Gwyr, the easternmost cantref of Ystrad Tywi. This area was noted for its valuable land and was highly contested by the early Welsh kingdoms. During the Viking Age, the mouth of the Tawe became a focus for trade, and a trade post may have been founded sometime between the 9th and 11th centuries.

The settlement remained under Welsh control until the Norman Invasion of Wales, when Iestyn ap Gwrgant ceded the settlement as part of the new Lordship of Gower to Henry de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Warwick in the early 1100s. The Lordship included land around Swansea Bay as far as the River Tawe, the manor of Kilvey beyond the Tawe, and the peninsula itself.

In the following years, Henry built Swansea Castle , and minted coins bearing the names &quot;Swensi&quot;, &quot;Sweni&quot; and &quot;Svenshi&quot; . Swansea was designated chief town of the lordship and received its first borough charter sometime between 1158 and 1184 from William de Newburgh, 3rd Earl of Warwick. This charter contains the earliest reference in English to &quot;Sweynesse&quot; and gave it the status of a borough, granting the townsmen (called burgesses) certain rights to develop the area. In 1215 King John granted a second charter, in which the name appears as &quot;Sweyneshe&quot;. A town seal which is believed to date from this period names the town as &quot;Sweyse&quot;. Another charter was granted in 1304.

===Industrial Revolution===


From the early 1700s to the late 1800s, Swansea was the world&#x27;s leading copper-smelting area. Numerous smelters along the River Tawe received copper and other metal ores shipped from Cornwall and Devon, as well as from North and South America, Africa, and Australia. The industry declined severely in the late 1800s, and none of the smelters are now active.

The port of Swansea initially traded in wine, hides, wool, cloth and later in coal. After the invention of the reverbatory furnace in the late 1600s, copper smelting could use coal rather than the more expensive charcoal. At the same time, the mines of Cornwall were increasing copper production. Swansea became the ideal place to smelt the Cornish copper ores, being close to the coalfields of South Wales and having an excellent port to receive ships carrying Cornish copper ore. Because each ton of copper ore smelted used about three tons of coal, it was more economical to ship the copper ore to Wales rather than sending the coal to Cornwall.

The first copper smelter at Swansea was established in 1717, followed by many more. Once smelting was established, the smelters began receiving high-grade ore and ore concentrates from around the world. More coal mines opened to meet demand from northeast Gower to Clyne and Llangyfelach. In the 1850s Swansea had more than 600 furnaces, and a fleet of 500 oceangoing ships carrying out Welsh coal and bringing back metal ore from around the world. At that time most of the copper matte produced in the United States was sent to Swansea for refining.

Smelters also processed arsenic, zinc, tin, and other metals. Nearby factories produced tinplate and pottery. The Swansea smelters became so adept at recovering gold and silver from complex ores that in the 1800s they received ore concentrates from the United States, for example from Arizona in the 1850s, and Colorado in the 1860s.

The city expanded rapidly in the 18th and 19th centuries, and was termed &quot;Copperopolis&quot;. From the late 17th century to 1801, Swansea&#x27;s population grew by 500%—the first official census (in 1841) indicated that, with 6,099 inhabitants, Swansea had become significantly larger than Glamorgan&#x27;s county town, Cardiff, and was the second most populous town in Wales behind Merthyr Tydfil (which had a population of 7,705). However, the census understated Swansea&#x27;s true size, as much of the built-up area lay outside the contemporary boundaries of the borough; the total population was actually 10,117. Swansea&#x27;s population was later overtaken by Merthyr in 1821 and by Cardiff in 1881, although in the latter year Swansea once again surpassed Merthyr. Much of Swansea&#x27;s growth was due to migration from within and beyond Wales—in 1881 more than a third of the borough&#x27;s population had been born outside Swansea and Glamorgan, and just under a quarter outside Wales.

Copper smelting at Swansea declined in the late 1800s for a number of reasons: copper mining in Cornwall declined; the price of copper dropped from £112 in 1860 to £35 in the 1890s; in the early 1900s, mining shifted to lower-grade copper deposits in North and South America, and the lower-grade ore could not support transportation to Swansea.
The Swansea and Mumbles Railway was built in 1804 to move limestone from the quarries of Mumbles and coal from the Clyne valley to Swansea and to the markets beyond. It carried the world&#x27;s first fare-paying rail passengers on the same day the British Parliament abolished the transportation of slaves from Africa. It later moved from horse power to steam locomotion, and finally converting to electric trams, before closing in January 1960, in favour of motor buses.

===20th century===
Through the 20th century, heavy industries in the town declined, leaving the Lower Swansea Valley filled with derelict works and mounds of waste products from them. The Lower Swansea Valley Scheme (which still continues) reclaimed much of the land. The present Enterprise Zone was the result and, of the many original docks, only those outside the city continue to work as docks; North Dock is now Parc Tawe and South Dock became the Marina.
In the Second World War, Swansea&#x27;s industrial importance made it a target of German bombing; much of the town centre was destroyed during the Swansea Blitz on the 19, 20 and 21 February 1941 (the &quot;Three Nights Blitz&quot;).)

In 1969, Swansea was granted city status to mark Prince Charles&#x27;s investiture as the Prince of Wales. The Prince made the announcement on 3 July 1969 during a tour of Wales. Swansea obtained the further right to have a Lord Mayor in 1982.

Within the city centre are the ruins of the castle, the Marina, the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery, Swansea Museum, the Dylan Thomas Centre, the Environment Centre, and the Market, which is the largest covered market in Wales.
It backs onto the Quadrant Shopping Centre, which opened in 1978, and the adjoining St David&#x27;s Centre opened in 1982. Other notable modern buildings include the BT Tower (formerly the GPO tower) built around 1970, Alexandra House opened in 1976, County Hall opened in July 1982. Swansea Leisure Centre opened in 1977; it has undergone extensive refurbishment which retained elements of the original structure and re-opened in March 2008.

==Governance==

The &quot;City and County of Swansea&quot; local authority area is bordered by unitary authorities of Carmarthenshire to the north, and Neath Port Talbot to the east. The Urban Subdivision of Swansea covers all urbanised areas within the city boundary, with a population of 179,485, it is considerably smaller than the unitary authority.

The local government area is in size, about 2% of the area of Wales. It includes a large amount of open countryside and a central urban and suburban belt.

===Local government===

In 1887, Swansea was a township at the mouth of the river Tawe, covering in the county of Glamorgan. There were three major extensions to the boundaries of the borough: the first in 1835, when Morriston, St Thomas, Landore, St John-juxta-Swansea and part of Llansamlet parish were added; again in 1889, when areas around Cwmbwrla and Trewyddfa were included; and when the borough was enlarged in 1918 to include the whole of the ancient parish of Swansea, the southern part of Llangyfelach parish, all of Llansamlet parish, Oystermouth Urban District and Brynau parish.

In 1889, Swansea attained county borough status and it was granted city status in 1969, which was inherited by the Swansea district when it was formed by the merger of the borough and Gower Rural District in 1974. In 1996, Swansea became one of 22 unitary authorities with the addition of part of the former Lliw Valley Borough. The new authority received the name &quot;City and County of Swansea&quot; ().

Swansea was once a staunch stronghold of the Labour Party which, until 2004, had overall control of the council for 24 years. The Liberal Democrats were the largest group in the administration that took control of Swansea Council in the 2004 local elections until the 2012 council elections saw the council return to Labour control. For 2009/2010, the Lord Mayor of Swansea was Councillor Alan Lloyd, and in 2010/2011 Richard Lewis was the Lord Mayor. The Lord Mayor changes in May each year.

===Senedd===
The Senedd constituencies are:

* Gower, current MS is Rebecca Evans, Labour since 2016
* Swansea East, current MS is Mike Hedges, Labour since 2011
* Swansea West, current MS is Julie James, Labour since 2011.

The city also falls under the South Wales West regional constituency which is served by Tom Giffard (Conservative), Sioned Williams (Plaid Cymru), Altaf Hussain (Conservative) and Luke Fletcher (Plaid Cymru).

===UK parliament===
The UK parliamentary constituencies covering Swansea and their MPs are:
* Gower: Tonia Antoniazzi, Labour
* Neath and Swansea East: Carolyn Harris, Labour 
* Swansea West: Torsten Bell, Labour.

==Geography==

Swansea may be divided into four physical areas. The geology is complex, providing diverse scenery. The Gower Peninsula was the first area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Apart from the southeast corner, the whole of the Gower Peninsula is within the AONB. Swansea has numerous urban and country parklands. The region has featured regularly in the Wales in Bloom awards.

To the north are the Lliw uplands which are mainly open moorland, reaching the foothills of the Black Mountain range. To the east is the coastal strip around Swansea Bay. Cutting through the middle from the south-east to the north-west is the urban and suburban zone stretching from the Swansea city centre to the towns of Gorseinon and Pontarddulais. The most populated areas of Swansea are Morriston, Sketty and the city centre. The chief urbanised area radiates from the city centre towards the north, south and west; along the coast of Swansea Bay to Mumbles; up the Swansea Valley past Landore and Morriston to Clydach; over Townhill and Mayhill to Cwmbwrla, Penlan, Treboeth and Fforestfach; through Uplands, Sketty, Killay to Dunvant; and east of the river from St. Thomas to Bonymaen, Llansamlet and Birchgrove. A second urbanised area is focused on a triangle defined by Gowerton, Gorseinon and Loughor along with the satellite communities of Penllergaer and Pontarddulais. About three-quarters of Swansea is on the coast—the Loughor Estuary, Swansea Bay and the Bristol Channel.

The geology of the Gower Peninsula ranges from Carboniferous Limestone cliffs along its southern edge from Mumbles to Worm&#x27;s Head and the salt-marshes and dune systems of the Loughor estuary to the north. The eastern, southern and western coasts of the peninsula are lined with numerous sandy beaches both wide and small, separated by steep cliffs. The South Wales Coalfield reaches the coast in the Swansea area. This had a great bearing on the development of the city of Swansea and other nearby towns such as Morriston. The inland area is covered by large swathes of grassland common overlooked by sandstone heath ridges including the prominent Cefn Bryn. The traditional agricultural landscape consists of a patchwork of fields characterised by walls, stone-faced banks and hedgerows. Valleys cut through the peninsula and contain rich deciduous woodland.

Much of Swansea is hilly, with the main area of upland being located in the council ward of Mawr. Areas up to in elevation range across the central section: Kilvey Hill, Townhill and Llwynmawr separate the centre of Swansea from its northern suburbs. Cefn Bryn, a ridge of high land, is the backbone of the Gower Peninsula. Rhossili Down, Hardings Down and Llanmadoc Hill are up to high. The highest point is located Penlle&#x27;r Castell at on the northern border with Carmarthenshire.
===Climate===
Swansea has a temperate oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;). As part of a coastal region, it experiences a milder climate than inland. Swansea is exposed to rain-bearing winds from the Atlantic, also cooling summer temperatures.

==Demographics==

From 1804 until the 1920s, Swansea experienced continuous population growth. The 1930s and 1940s was a period of slight decline. In the 1950s and 1960s, the population grew and then fell in the 1970s. The population grew again in the 1980s only to fall again in the 1990s. In the 21st century, Swansea is experiencing a small amount of population growth; the local authority area had an estimated population of 228,100 in 2007. However, by the 2021 census, this population growth has reversed its trend very slightly with the population declining by 0.2% 
Around 82% of the population were born in Wales and 13% born in England; 13.4% were Welsh speakers.

The population of the Swansea built-up area within the unitary authority boundaries in 2011 was about 179,485 and the council population was 238,700. The other built-up areas within the unitary authority are centred on Gorseinon and Pontarddulais. In 2011, the Gorseinon built-up area had a population of 20,581 and the Pontarddulais built-up area had a population of 9,073.

The wider urban area, including most of Swansea Bay, has a total population of 300,352, making it the third largest urban area in Wales and the 27th largest urban area in the United Kingdom. Over 218,000 individuals are white; 1,106 are of mixed race; 2,215 are Asian – mainly Bangladeshi (1,015); 300 are black; and 1,195 belong to other ethnic groups.
The Office for National Statistics 2010 mid-year population estimate for the City &amp; County of Swansea is 232,500.

=== Religion ===

In 2001, 158,457 people in the local authority area (71 per cent) stated their religion to be Christian, 44,286 (20 per cent) no religion, 16,800 (7.5 per cent) did not state a religion and 2,167 were Muslim. There are small communities of other religions, each making up a little under 1 per cent of the total population.
Swansea is part of the Anglican Diocese of Swansea and Brecon and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Menevia. The Catholic see is based in Swansea at St. Joseph&#x27;s Cathedral in the Greenhill area.
Swansea, like Wales in general, has seen many Non-conformist religious revivals. In 1904, Evan Roberts, a miner from Loughor (Llwchwr), just outside Swansea, was the leader of what has been called one of the world&#x27;s greatest Protestant religious revivals. Within a few months, about 100,000 people were converted. This revival in particular had a profound effect on Welsh society. Swansea is covered by the Swansea and Gower Methodist Circuit.

The Ebenezer Baptist Church dates from November 1875 when the foundation stone was laid for Tabernacle chapel in Skinner Street. The first pastor, the Rev. J. D. Jones, was called in February 1876 and the new building was opened in July that year. The church was served by a number of ministers until 1911 when the Rev. R. J. Willoughby came to the church. The church has an organ by Harrison &amp; Harrison.

The Norwegian Church is a Grade II listed building in the docklands area of the city. The church building was originally located at Newport Docks. The building consists of a Seaman&#x27;s Mission to the west end and a single gothic church to the east end. It was originally built as a place of worship for Norwegian sailors when they visited the UK. It was relocated to Swansea in 1910 at a site directly opposite the Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket on the River Tawe.

The city is home to 10% of the total Welsh Muslim population; Swansea&#x27;s Muslim community is raising money to open a new central mosque and community centre in the former St. Andrew&#x27;s United Reformed Church. This would replace the existing central Mosque on St Helens Road and be in addition to the other three existing mosques (Swansea University Mosque, Hafod Mosque, Imam Khoei Mosque).

Swansea is represented in Buddhism with the Dharmavajra Kadampa Buddhist Centre, Pulpung Changchub Dargyeling (Kagyu Tradition) and a branch of the international Dzogchen Community (Nyingma Tradition). Swansea Synagogue and Jehovah&#x27;s Witness Kingdom Hall are both located in the Uplands area. Around 160 people in Swansea indicated they were Jewish in the 2011 census.

The following table shows the religious identity of residents residing in Swansea according to the 2001, 2011 and the 2021 censuses:

=== Ethnicity ===
==Transport==
===Road===
The M4 motorway, with junctions 44 to 47, bypasses Swansea, replacing the A48 as the main east–west route. Both the M4 and the A48 connect with Neath, Port Talbot and Cardiff to the east and Carmarthen to the west. The A483 dual carriageway links the city centre with the motorway at junction 42 to the east and junction 47 to the north-west.

On departing Swansea to the north, the A483 multiplexes with the A48 before continuing through mid Wales and terminating at Chester. The A4067 connecting Mumbles with the city centre and continuing up the Swansea Valley towards Brecon is also a dual carriageway for much of its route through Swansea. Other notable local roads include the A484, which provides a link from Fforestfach west to Llanelli, and the A4118, the main route westwards from the city centre across Gower to Port Eynon.

===Railway===
Swansea railway station is served by two train operating companies: 
* Transport for Wales operates services to Llanelli, Carmarthen, Haverfordwest, Milford Haven, Tenby, Pembroke Dock and Fishguard Harbour (connecting with the Stena Line to Rosslare Europort and Irish Rail to Dublin Connolly). There are also suburban services to ,  and . Inter-city services connect the city with Hereford, Shrewsbury, Crewe and Manchester Piccadilly.
* Great Western Railway operates inter-city services to Carmarthen, Cardiff Central, Newport, Bristol Parkway, Swindon, Reading and London Paddington.

===Buses and coaches===

Bus routes in the area are operated predominantly by First Cymru, with smaller operators such as Adventure Travel, South Wales Transport and DANSA also operate some routes in the city, most of which serve Swansea bus station.

Local bus routes run throughout the city, including to Morriston Hospital, Singleton Hospital and Swansea University. Regional routes connect the area with Brecon, Bridgend, Mumbles and Cardiff.

Coach services include:
* National Express Coaches operates services to Heathrow Airport, Gatwick Airport, London, Birmingham, Cardiff, Bristol, Llanelli, Carmarthen and Haverfordwest
* FlixBus operates to Cardiff, Newport, Bristol, Heathrow Airport and London.

====Park and ride====
Park and ride services are operated from car parks at Landore and Fabian Way. During busy periods of the year, additional services are operated from the Brynmill recreation ground.
Subsidised services to Fforestfach were cut in 2015 due to local authority financial constraints.

===Air===
Swansea Airport is a minor aerodrome situated in the Gower providing recreational flights only. Further development of the airport is strongly resisted by the local communities and environmental groups. 

Cardiff Airport, to the east in the Vale of Glamorgan, provides scheduled domestic and international flights. It is approximately 40 minutes away by road or 70 minutes by rail. 

Pembrey Airport, to the west, is available for private flights.

===Sea===

Swansea Marina to the south of the city centre has berths for 410 leisure boats. An addition 200 berths for leisure boats are located near the mouth of the River Tawe. Further leisure boating berths are being constructed at the Prince of Wales Dock in the Swansea Docks complex. The Swansea Docks complex is owned and operated by Associated British Ports and is used to handle a range of cargo ranging from agribulks and coal to timber and steel. Swansea Docks consists of three floating docks and a ferry terminal.

Fastnet Line operated a Swansea Cork Ferry roll-on/roll-off service until November 2011, when the service was ended. A proposal for a catamaran-based passenger ferry service from Ilfracombe to Swansea, scheduled to begin in time for Easter in 2010, has yet to launch. It would have had two return trips a day taking around 50 minutes each way and carried cycles.

===Cycling===
There are four dedicated cycle routes in the local authority&#x27;s area:
* Swansea Bay: The Maritime Quarter to the Knab Rock near the Mumbles Pier.
* Clyne Valley Country Park: Blackpill to Gowerton forming part of National Cycle Network (NCN) Route 4.
* Along the east bank of the River Tawe forming the start of NCN, Route 43, which terminates at Abercraf. Sustrans advise that it will continue northwards to Builth Wells once complete.
* Adjacent to the Fabian Way: Forming part of NCN Route 4 and extending as the Celtic Trail to Chepstow and London.

City cruiser pedal vehicles are being introduced to the city centre in a joint venture between the council and Swansea Business Improvement District.

In November 2007, a new bridge was completed over the Fabian Way which provides a one way park and ride bus lane and a shared-use pedestrian and NCN route 4 cycleway. The leaf-shaped bridge was shortlisted for the 2008 British Constructional Steelwork Association Structural Steel Design Awards.

==Culture==
The Royal Institution of South Wales was founded in 1835 as the Swansea Literary and Philosophical Society.

===Performing arts===

The Grand Theatre in the centre of the city is a Victorian theatre which celebrated its centenary in 1997 and which has a capacity of a little over a thousand people. It was opened by the celebrated opera singer Adelina Patti and was refurbished from 1983 to 1987. The annual programme ranges from pantomime and drama to opera and ballet. 

Fluellen Theatre Company is a professional theatre company based in Swansea who perform at the Grand Theatre and the Dylan Thomas Centre. The Taliesin building on the university campus has a theatre, opened in 1984. 

Other theatres include the Dylan Thomas Theatre (formerly the Little Theatre), near the marina, and one in Penyrheol Leisure Centre near Gorseinon. In the summer, outdoor Shakespeare performances are a regular feature at Oystermouth Castle; Singleton Park is the venue for a number of parties and concerts, from dance music to outdoor Proms. A folk festival is held on Gower. Standing near Victoria Park on the coast road is the Patti Pavilion; this was the Winter Garden from Adelina Patti&#x27;s Craig-y-Nos estate in the upper Swansea valley, which she donated to the town in 1918. It is used as a venue for music shows and fairs. The Brangwyn Hall is a multi-use venue, with events such as the graduation ceremonies for Swansea University. Every autumn, Swansea hosts a Festival of Music and the Arts, when international orchestras and soloists visit the Brangwyn Hall. The Brangwyn Hall is praised for its acoustics for recitals, orchestral pieces and chamber music alike.

Swansea is home to the Palace Theatre. Located at 156 High Street, it is recognisable for its distinctive wedge shape. Originally built in 1888 as a traditional music hall, the building&#x27;s original name was the &quot;Pavilion&quot;. During its lifetime, the building has been used as a bingo hall as well as a nightclub.

In 2018, Singleton Park, Swansea was the home-city for BBC Music&#x27;s &#x27;Biggest Weekend&#x27; featuring Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift, Sam Smith, Florence + The Machine and others. Priority was given to Swansea residents in purchasing tickets for this one-off &#x27;day festival&#x27; (over 2 days); tickets were priced at £18 a day and all 60,000 tickets (30,000 for each day) sold out almost instantly.

===Festivals===
Swansea hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1863, 1891, 1907, 1926, 1964, 1982 and 2006. The 2006 event occupied the site of the former Felindre tinplate works to the north of the city and featured a strikingly pink main tent. In 2009 Swansea Council launched Wales&#x27;s only week long St David&#x27;s Week festival in venues throughout the city. &quot;The Beginning&quot; and &quot;Do Not Go Gentle&quot; are Festivals in the Uplands area of the city, where Dylan Thomas was born and lived for 23 years.

Swansea is known for its celebration of Beaujolais Day, with people booking tables in restaurants and bars for the day up to a year in advance to ensure they can sample the year&#x27;s newly released Beaujolais wine. Historian Peter Stead argues that its rise in popularity there can be traced to the city&#x27;s &quot;No Sign Bar&#x27; , owned in the 1960s by former Wales rugby union captain Clem Thomas, who owned a house in Burgundy and could transport Beaujolais quickly and cheaply to south Wales, and suggests that it reflected Swansea&#x27;s efforts to &quot;gentrify and intellectualise itself&quot; at the time. In 2015, it was estimated that Beaujolais Day contributed £5 million to the local economy.

===Welsh language===
There are many Welsh language chapels in the area. Welsh-medium education is a popular and growing choice for both English- and Welsh-speaking families. Just over 1,600 secondary pupils were educated through the medium of Welsh in 2017. Nearly double this figure, 3,063 pupils, are currently educated through the medium of Welsh in the primary sector. The 2014 Swansea Pre-School survey showed that 35% of parents across the city and county of Swansea would select a Welsh education for their children if there was a local Welsh school available to them. 45% of the rural council ward Mawr are able to speak Welsh, as can 38% of the ward of Pontarddulais. Clydach, Kingsbridge and Upper Loughor all have levels of more than 20%. By contrast, the urban St. Thomas has one of the lowest figures in Wales, at 6.4%, a figure only barely lower than Penderry and Townhill wards.

===Food===

Local produce includes cockles and laverbread sourced from the Loughor estuary. Salt marsh lamb, raised in the salt marshes of the estuary, is also a local speciality.

===Listed buildings===

The city has three Grade One listed buildings: Swansea Castle, the Tabernacle Chapel, Morriston and the Swansea Guildhall. Swansea Castle was an impressive building occupying a strategic position above the River Tawe. The ruins that are visible today date from the late 13th and early 14th centuries. Today, the castle is hemmed in by modern buildings. The Tabernacle Chapel at Morriston was built in 1872 by John Humphreys of Swansea. A unique feature is the use of semi-circular arches. The building has been described as the &quot;Nonconformist Cathedral of Wales&quot; and has been listed as Grade I on the basis that it is &quot;the most ambitious grand chapel in Wales, its interior and fittings remain virtually unaltered&quot;. The Guildhall is one of the main office buildings in the centre of the city and was designed by Percy Thomas and opened in 1934. It is faced in white Portland stone and includes a tall clock-tower which makes it a landmark. The building comprises the City Hall, the Brangwyn Hall concert venue and the County Law Courts. It is considered &quot;the most important building in Wales of its period&quot;.

In addition to these, there are a number of Grade II* listed buildings; Ebenezer Baptist Chapel and its Hall in Ebenezer Street; the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery; the Midland Bank building; the Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Kingsway, along with its Hall and School blocks; the Offices of Associated British Ports in Pier Street; the Royal Institution of South Wales building, now Swansea Museum in Victoria Road; and the Old Guildhall in Somerset Place.

==Sport==
Swansea City A.F.C. was founded in 1912 and is the city&#x27;s main football association team. Originally playing at the Vetch Field, they moved to the Swansea.com Stadium (then known as the Liberty Stadium) at the start of the 2005–06 season, winning promotion to League One in their final year at their old stadium. The team presently play in the English Championship, after spending seven seasons in the English Premier League. The Football Association of Wales had decided that for the Euro 2012 qualifying campaign, Wales would play all of their home ties at either the Cardiff City Stadium or the Liberty Stadium.

Swansea has four association football clubs that play in the Welsh football league system: Swansea University F.C., Garden Village, South Gower and West End.

Swansea is home to Swansea Rugby Football Club (Swansea RFC), a founder member of the Welsh Rugby Union and one of the most important teams in the early history of Welsh rugby union. Playing out of St Helens Rugby and Cricket Ground the club not only produced several of the greatest Welsh rugby superstars, including Billy Bancroft and Billy Trew, they also hosted national touring sides from Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. Known as the &quot;All Whites&quot;, Swansea kept a constant supply of players that filled the Welsh ranks in the early history of the game. In 1935 Swansea became the first club side to beat the All Blacks.

In 2003, Swansea RFC merged with Neath RFC to form the &quot;Ospreys&quot;. Swansea RFC remained at St Helen&#x27;s in semi-professional form, but the Ospreys moved into the Liberty Stadium in Landore for the start of the 2005–06 season. Neath-Swansea rugby games used to be hotly contested matches, such that there was some debate about whether a team incorporating both areas was possible. The team came fifth in the Celtic League in their first year of existence and topped that league in their second year. By 2012, they had won the league a then-record four times.

St Helens Rugby and Cricket Ground is the home of Swansea RFC and Glamorgan County Cricket Club have previously played matches there. In this ground, Sir Garfield Sobers hit six sixes in one over; the first time this was achieved in a game of first-class cricket. The final ball landed on the ground past the Cricketers&#x27; pub just outside the ground. It is also the home of the tallest floodlight stand in Europe.

Swansea&#x27;s rugby league side plays from Swansea in the small town of Ystalyfera. They are known as the &quot;Swansea Valley Miners&quot;, but were formed as the &quot;Swansea Bulls&quot; in 2002.

The Swansea Bowls Stadium opened in early 2008. The stadium hosted the World Indoor Singles and Mixed Pairs Championship in April 2008 and the Gravelles Welsh International Open Bowls Championships in 2009.

==Future plans==

Swansea city centre is undergoing a £1 billion transformation scheme. A large area of the city is earmarked for redevelopment. A new city-centre retail precinct is planned involving demolition of the dilapidated St. David&#x27;s Shopping Centre which has three or four traders, about 13% of the retail space in the centre and the Quadrant Shopping Centre. Including relocation of the Tesco Superstore near to the city&#x27;s Sainsbury&#x27;s store in Parc Tawe, the new retail precinct will be almost four times the size of the Quadrant Centre. The city centre is also being brightened up with street art and new walkways, along with the first phase of the David Evans – Castle Street development. New green spaces will be provided in conjunction with the proposed Quadrant Square and Grand Theatre Square. Redevelopment of the Oxford Street car park and Lower Oxford Street arcades are also planned.

At the sea front, The Tower, Meridian Quay is now Wales&#x27;s tallest building at a height of with a restaurant on the top (29th) floor. It was under construction adjacent Swansea Marina until 2010.

==Economy==


Swansea originally developed as centre for metals and mining, especially the copper industry, from the beginning of the 18th century. The industry reached its apogee in the 1880s, when 60% of the copper ores imported to Britain were smelted in the Lower Swansea valley. However, by the end of the Second World War these heavy industries were in decline, and over the post-war decades Swansea shared in the general trend towards a post-industrial, service sector economy.

Of the 105,900 people estimated to work within the City and County of Swansea, over 90% are employed in the service sectors, with relatively high shares (compared to the Welsh and UK averages) in &quot;public administration, education &amp; health&quot; and &quot;banking, finance &amp; insurance&quot;, and correspondingly high proportions of employment in occupations associated with the service sector, including professional, administrative/secretarial and sales/customer service occupations. The local authority believes this pattern reflects Swansea&#x27;s role as a service centre for South West Wales.

Economic activity and employment rates in Swansea were slightly above the Welsh average in October 2008, but lower than the UK average. In 2005, GVA per head in Swansea was £14,302 – nearly 4% above the Welsh average but 20% below the UK average. Median full-time earnings in Swansea were £21,577 in 2007, almost identical to the Welsh average.

Swansea is home to the DVLA headquarters in Morriston, which employs around 6,000 people in the city. Other major employers in the city are Admiral Group, HSBC, Virgin Media, Swansea Bay University Health Board, BT and Amazon.co.uk. Virgin Atlantic also maintains its largest worldwide contact centre in Swansea; including reservations, sales, baggage claims and customer relations.

Its engineering department is recognised as a centre of excellence with pioneering work on computational techniques for solving engineering design problems. The department of physics is renowned for its research achievements at the frontiers of theoretical physics, particularly in the areas of elementary particle physics and string theory. Many other departments including history, computer science and German have been awarded &quot;excellent&quot; inspection ratings. In 2015, Swansea University opened a new Bay Campus situated in the Jersey Marine area of Swansea. The university was awarded &quot;The Times&quot; Higher Education Supplement Award for the UK&#x27;s &quot;best student experience&quot; in 2005. In 2017, Swansea University Medical School was ranked as the third best medical school in the United Kingdom, behind Oxford and Cambridge universities.

Other establishments for further and higher education in the city include University of Wales Trinity Saint David, Gower College Swansea and also Swansea College. Trinity Saint David was formed on 18 November 2010 through the merger of University of Wales Lampeter and Trinity University college Carmarthen under Lampeter&#x27;s royal charter of 1828. On 1 August 2013, Swansea Metropolitan University became part of University of Wales Trinity Saint David (UWTSD). Swansea Metropolitan University was particularly well known for its Architectural Glass department, as well as its Teaching and Transport &amp; Logistics degrees. Trinity Saint David also took over the Swansea Business School, which was formerly part of the Metropolitan University. It continues to provide higher education in the field of business including an MBA programme. Swansea Sixth Form College Wales (&quot;sscwales&quot;) was founded in 2013 and changed its name to Swansea College in 2021.

The football violence that Swansea experienced during the 1970s–1990s has considerably reduced; the only major clashes occurring between Swansea City supporters and Cardiff City supporters. Many matches between these sides have ended in violence in both Swansea and Cardiff. These two clubs have a long history of intense rivalry, so much so that it is described in the media as &quot;tribal&quot;.

==Leisure and tourism==

A number of beaches around Swansea Bay are promoted to visitors. Surfing is possible at Langland Bay, Caswell Bay and Llangennith, with the latter winning accolades from two national newspapers for the quality of its waves. The promenade from the Marina to Mumbles offers views across Swansea Bay. The seaside village of Mumbles has a Victorian pier, small independent shops and boutiques, restaurants and cafes. The south coast of Gower is the chief magnet for walkers, with a path stretching from Mumbles Head across the cliff tops, beaches and coastal woodland to Rhossili.

On the waterfront, Swansea Bay has a sweep of coastline which features a beach, promenade, children&#x27;s lido, leisure pool, marina and maritime quarter featuring the museums the National Waterfront Museum and Swansea Museum, the oldest museum in Wales.

Oxwich Bay on the Gower Peninsula was named the most beautiful beach in the United Kingdom by travel writers who visited more than 1,000 beaches around the world in search of the perfect sands (2007). &quot;The Travel Magazine&quot; praised Oxwich for &quot;magnificent and unspoilt&quot; scenery and as a &quot;great place for adults and children to explore&quot;. It has over three miles (5 km) of sand and &quot;The Guardian&quot; named it one of Britain&#x27;s blue-riband top 10 category beaches (2007). &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper hailed Rhossili Bay as &quot;the British supermodel of beaches&quot; (2006) and the best beach in Britain for breathtaking cliffs (2007), whilst &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; listed it as one of the 25 best beaches in the world (2006). Thanks to its clear air and lovely golden sand, this romantic stretch of sand was voted the best place in the UK to watch the sun set (&quot;Country Living&quot; magazine 2005) and one of the top romantic spots in the country (&quot;The Guardian&quot; 2007).

Llangennith Beach, with its soft sands, consistent beach break and great facilities, was listed as the best place to learn how to surf in Britain by The Observer (2006) and one of the 10 &#x27;classic surfing beaches by &quot;The Guardian&quot; (2007). Gower also claims Britain&#x27;s Best Beach, Three Cliffs Bay. The Gower landmark topped the BBC Holiday Hit Squad nationwide competition (2006) and was voted Britain&#x27;s best camping beach by &quot;The Independent&quot; thanks to its superb setting and quiet location (2007). Three Cliffs Bay also made the final of the ITV series &quot;Britain&#x27;s Favourite View&quot; – the only nomination in Wales and backed by singer Katherine Jenkins.

==Twinning==
Swansea is twinned with:
* Cork, Ireland
* Mannheim, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;
* Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, Nouvelle-Aquitaine, France
* Bydgoszcz, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, Poland.

It also has a friendship link with Nantong, China.

==Notable people==
* The poet Dylan Thomas is perhaps the best-known. He was born in the town and grew up at 5 Cwmdonkin Drive, Uplands, where he lived for 23 years. He produced two-thirds of his published work from his tiny bedroom, which has been faithfully recreated as it may have been in 1934; it is open for house tours, events, Edwardian dinner parties and overnight stays. There is a memorial to him in the nearby Cwmdonkin Park; he described Swansea as an &quot;ugly lovely town&quot;. In the 1930s, Thomas was a member of a group of local artists, writers and musicians known as The Kardomah Gang, which met in the Kardomah Café which was in Castle Street, Swansea until bombed during the Second World War.
* Throughout the 19th century, the Vivian family did much to develop Swansea. Their wealth and influence came from large copper-mining, smelting and trading businesses in Swansea (Vivian &amp; Sons), and is still visible today in their former family residences: Singleton Abbey (now used by Swansea University), Sketty Hall, Clyne Castle and Clyne Gardens. Henry Vivian became the first Lord Swansea in 1893.
* Rowan Williams, former Archbishop of Canterbury, was born in Swansea. He was educated at the state-sector Dynevor School, Swansea before reading theology at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge. 
* Catherine Zeta-Jones was born and raised in Swansea and still owns a home in Mumbles. 
* Swansea is the home town of Non Stanford, the 2013 ITU Triathlon World Champion.
* The thriller writer, Mark Ellis, was educated in Swansea.
* The American-born philosopher of Welsh descent Rush Rhees taught at Swansea University from 1940 to 1966 and is buried at Oystermouth Cemetery in Mumbles.
* Dr Who screenwriter Russell T Davies was born in Swansea.
* Princess Lilian of Sweden, Duchess of Halland (1912–2013), married to His Royal Highness Prince Bertil of Sweden, Duke of Halland.
* Actor Matt Ryan (Assassin&#x27;s Creed Black Flag/Constantine) is from Swansea. When Ubisoft was casting Edward Kenway for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Black Flag, he was originally written to be from London. Matt auditioned with a London accent and got the part. When he went to record, they asked him where he was from and liked his actual accent so much they rewrote Edward Kenway to be from Swansea as well.

People from Swansea are known locally as &quot;Swansea Jacks&quot;, or just &quot;Jacks&quot;; the source of this nickname is not clear. Some attribute it to Swansea Jack, the life-saving dog.

<doc id="46396" wikidata="Q9402" url="?curid=46396" title="Ninja">
<text>A ninja (; ) or shinobi (; ) was a spy and infiltrator in pre-modern Japan. The functions of a ninja included siege and infiltration, ambush, reconnaissance, espionage, deception, and later bodyguarding. Antecedents may have existed as early as the 12th century. There is little evidence that they were assassins.

In the unrest of the Sengoku period, &quot;jizamurai&quot; families, that is, elite peasant-warriors, in Iga Province and the adjacent Kōka District formed &quot;ikki&quot; – &quot;revolts&quot; or &quot;leagues&quot; – as a means of self-defense. They became known for their military activities in the nearby regions and sold their services as mercenaries and spies. It is from these areas that much of the knowledge regarding the ninja is drawn. Following the Tokugawa shogunate in the 17th century, the ninja faded into obscurity. A number of &quot;shinobi&quot; manuals, often based on Chinese military philosophy, were written in the 17th and 18th centuries, most notably the &quot;Bansenshūkai&quot; (1676).

By the time of the Meiji Restoration (1868), &quot;shinobi&quot; had become a topic of popular imagination and mystery in Japan. Ninja figured prominently in legend and folklore, where they were associated with legendary abilities such as invisibility, walking on water, and control over natural elements. Much of their perception in popular culture is based on such legends and folklore, as opposed to the covert actors of the Sengoku period.

==Etymology==

&quot;Ninja&quot; is the &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; (Early Middle Chinese–influenced) reading of the two kanji &quot;忍者&quot;. In the native &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; reading, it is pronounced &quot;shinobi&quot;, a shortened form of &quot;shinobi-no-mono&quot; (忍びの者).

The word &quot;shinobi&quot; appears in the written record as far back as the late 8th century in poems in the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;. The underlying connotation of &quot;shinobi&quot; (忍) means &quot;to steal away; to hide&quot; and—by extension—&quot;to forbear&quot;, hence its association with stealth and invisibility. &quot;Mono&quot; (者) means &quot;a person&quot;.

Historically, the word &quot;ninja&quot; was not in common use, and a variety of regional colloquialisms evolved to describe what would later be dubbed ninja. Along with &quot;shinobi&quot;, these include &quot;monomi&quot; (&quot;one who sees&quot;), &quot;nokizaru&quot; (&quot;macaque on the roof&quot;), &quot;rappa&quot; (&quot;ruffian&quot;), &quot;kusa&quot; (&quot;grass&quot;) and &quot;Iga-mono&quot; (&quot;one from Iga&quot;). In historical documents, &quot;shinobi&quot; is almost always used.

&quot;Kunoichi&quot; (くノ一) is, originally, an argot which means &quot;woman&quot;; it supposedly comes from the characters くノ一 (respectively hiragana &quot;ku&quot;, katakana &quot;no&quot; and kanji &quot;ichi&quot;), which make up the three strokes that form the kanji for &quot;woman&quot; (女). In fiction written in the modern era &quot;kunoichi&quot; means &quot;female ninja&quot;.

In English, the plural of &quot;ninja&quot; can be either unchanged as &quot;ninja&quot;, reflecting the Japanese language&#x27;s lack of grammatical number, or the regular English plural &quot;ninjas&quot;.

==History==
Despite many popular folktales, historical accounts of the ninja are scarce. The social origin of the ninja is seen as the reason they agree to operate in secret, trading their service for money without honor and glory. 

However, some &quot;ninjutsu&quot; books described specifically what tactics ninja should use to fight, and the scenarios in which a ninja might find themselves can be deduced from those tactics. For example, in the manuscript of volume 2 of &quot;Kanrin Seiyō&quot; (間林清陽) which is the original book of &quot;Bansenshūkai&quot; (万川集海), there are 48 points of ninja&#x27;s fighting techniques, such as how to make &quot;makibishi&quot; from bamboo, how to make footwear that makes no sound, fighting techniques when surrounded by many enemies, precautions when using swords at night, how to listen to small sounds, &quot;kuji-kiri&quot; that prevents guard dogs from barking, and so on.

===Predecessors===

The title &quot;ninja&quot; has sometimes been attributed retrospectively to the semi-legendary 2nd-century prince Yamato Takeru. In the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, the young Yamato Takeru disguised himself as a charming maiden and assassinated two chiefs of the Kumaso people. However, these records take place at a very early stage of Japanese history, and they are unlikely to be connected to the &quot;shinobi&quot; of later accounts. The first recorded use of espionage was under the employment of Prince Shōtoku in the 6th century. Such tactics were considered unsavory even in early times, when, according to the 10th-century &quot;Shōmonki&quot;, the boy spy Hasetsukabe no Koharumaru was killed for spying against the insurgent Taira no Masakado. Later, the 14th-century war chronicle &quot;Taiheiki&quot; contained many references to &quot;shinobi&quot; and credited the destruction of a castle by fire to an unnamed but &quot;highly skilled &quot;shinobi&quot;&quot;.

===Early history===
It was not until the 15th century that spies were specially trained for their purpose. It was around this time that the word &quot;shinobi&quot; appeared to define and clearly identify ninja as a secretive group of agents. Evidence for this can be seen in historical documents, which began to refer to stealthy soldiers as &quot;shinobi&quot; during the Sengoku period. Later manuals regarding espionage are often grounded in Chinese military strategy, quoting works such as &quot;The Art of War&quot; by Sun Tzu.

By the Sengoku period, the &quot;shinobi&quot; had several roles, including spy (&quot;kanchō&quot;), scout (&quot;teisatsu&quot;), surprise attacker (&quot;kishu&quot;), and agitator (&quot;konran&quot;). The ninja families were organized into larger guilds, each with their own territories. A system of rank existed. A &quot;jōnin&quot; (&quot;upper person&quot;) was the highest rank, representing the group and hiring out mercenaries. This is followed by the &quot;chūnin&quot; (&quot;middle person&quot;), assistants to the &quot;jōnin&quot;. At the bottom was the &quot;genin&quot; (&quot;lower person&quot;), field agents drawn from the lower class and assigned to carry out actual missions.

===Iga and Kōga clans===
The Iga and Kōga &quot;clans&quot; were &quot;jizamurai&quot; families living in the province of Iga (modern Mie Prefecture) and the adjacent region of Kōka (later written as &quot;Kōga&quot;), named after a village in what is now Shiga Prefecture. From these regions, villages devoted to the training of ninja first appeared. The remoteness and inaccessibility of the surrounding mountains in Iga may have had a role in the ninja&#x27;s secretive development. The chronicle &quot;Go Kagami Furoku&quot; writes, of the two clans&#x27; origins:

Likewise, a supplement to the &quot;Nochi Kagami&quot;, a record of the Ashikaga shogunate, confirms the same Iga origin:

These professional ninja were actively hired by &quot;daimyōs&quot; between 1485 and 1581. Specifically, the Iga professionals were sought after for their skill at siege warfare, or &quot;shirotori&quot;, which included night attacks and ambush. By the 1460s, the leading families in the regions had established &quot;de facto&quot; independence from their &quot;shugo&quot;. The Kōka &quot;ikki&quot; persisted until 1574, when it was forced to become a vassal of Oda Nobunaga. The Iga &quot;ikki&quot; continued until 1581, when Nobunaga invaded Iga Province and wiped out the organized clans. Survivors were forced to flee, some to the mountains of Kii, but others arrived before Tokugawa Ieyasu, where they were well treated. Some former Iga clan members, including Hattori Hanzō, would later serve as Tokugawa&#x27;s bodyguards. Prior to the conquest of Kōka in 1574, the two confederacies worked in alliance together from at least 1487.

Following the Battle of Okehazama in 1560, Tokugawa employed a group of eighty Kōga ninja, led by Tomo Sukesada. They were tasked to raid an outpost of the Imagawa clan. The account of this assault is given in the &quot;Mikawa Go Fudoki&quot;, where it was written that Kōga ninja infiltrated the castle, set fire to its towers, and killed the castellan along with two hundred of the garrison.

=== Activities under Tokugawa ===
After the assassination of Oda Nobunaga, Iga and Kōka ninja, according to tradition, helped Ieyasu undergo an arduous journey to escape the enemies of Nobunaga in Sakai and return to Mikawa. However, their journey was very dangerous due to the existence of &quot;Ochimusha-gari&quot; groups across the route. During this journey, Tokugawa generals such as Ii Naomasa, Sakai Tadatsugu and Honda Tadakatsu fought their way through raids and harassment from Ochimusha-gari (Samurai hunter) outlaws to secure the way for Ieyasu, while sometimes advancing by usage of gold and silver bribes given to some of the more amenable Ochimusha-gari groups. As they reached Kada, an area between Kameyama town and Iga, The attacks from Ochimusha-gari finally ended as they reached the former territory of the Kōka ikki, who were friendly to the Tokugawa clan. The Koka ninja assisted the Tokugawa escort group in eliminating the threats of Ochimusha-gari outlaws then escorting them until they reached Iga Province, where they were further protected by samurai clans from Iga ikki which accompanied the Ieyasu group until they safely reached Mikawa. The &quot;Ietada nikki&quot; journal records that the escort group of Ieyasu has killed some 200 outlaws during their journey from Osaka.

The Kōga ninja are said to have played a role in the later Battle of Sekigahara (1600), where several hundred Kōga assisted soldiers under Torii Mototada in the defence of Fushimi Castle. After Tokugawa&#x27;s victory at Sekigahara, the Iga acted as guards for the inner compounds of Edo Castle, while the Kōga acted as a police force and assisted in guarding the outer gate. In 1603, a group of ninja warriors from Iga clan led by Miura Yo&#x27;emon were assigned under the command of Red Demon brigades of Ii Naomasa, the daimyo of Hikone under Tokugawa shogunate.

In 1608, a daimyo named Tōdō Takatora was assigned by Ieyasu to control of Tsu, a newly established domain which covered portions of Iga and Ise Province. The domain at first worth of to the 220,000, then grow further in productivity to the total revenue of 320,000 koku under Takatora governance. It was reported that Tōdō Takatora employs the Iga-ryū Ninjas. Aside from Ninjas, he also employs local clans of Iga province as &quot;Musokunin&quot;, which is a class of part time Samurai who has been allowed to retain their clan name but does not own any land or &quot;Han&quot;. The Musokunin also worked as farmer during peace, while they are obliged to take arms in the time of war.

In 1614, The Iga province warriors saw action during the siege of Osaka. Takatora brought the Musokunin auxiliaries from Iga province to besiege the Osaka castle during the winter phase. Meanwhile the ninja units of Iga province were deployed under several commanders such as Hattori Hanzō, and Yamaoka Kagetsuge, and Ii Naotora, heir of Naomasa who also given control of Ii clan&#x27;s Red Demons ninjas after Naomasa died. Later in 1615, during the summer phase of Osaka siege, The Ii clan Red Demons ninjas led by Miura Yo&#x27;emon, Shimotani Sanzo, Okuda Kasa&#x27;emon, and Saga Kita&#x27;emon saw action once again during the Battle of Tennōji, as they were reportedly fought together with the Tokugawa regular army storming on the south gate of Osaka castle. In 1614, the initial &quot;winter campaign&quot; at the Siege of Osaka saw the ninja in use once again. Miura Yoemon, a ninja in Tokugawa&#x27;s service, recruited &quot;shinobi&quot; from the Iga region, and sent 10 ninja into Osaka Castle in an effort to foster antagonism between enemy commanders.During the later &quot;summer campaign&quot;, these hired ninja fought alongside regular troops at the Battle of Tennōji.

===Shimabara rebellion===
A final but detailed record of ninja employed in open warfare occurred during the Shimabara Rebellion (1637–1638). The Kōga ninja were recruited by &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Iemitsu against Christian rebels led by Amakusa Shirō, who made a final stand at Hara Castle, in Hizen Province. A diary kept by a member of the Matsudaira clan, the &quot;Amakusa Gunki&quot;, relates: &quot;Men from Kōga in Ōmi Province who concealed their appearance would steal up to the castle every night and go inside as they pleased.&quot;

The Ukai diary, written by a descendant of Ukai Kanemon, has several entries describing the reconnaissance actions taken by the Kōga.


Suspecting that the castle&#x27;s supplies might be running low, the siege commander Matsudaira Nobutsuna ordered a raid on the castle&#x27;s provisions. Here, the Kōga captured bags of enemy provisions, and infiltrated the castle by night, obtaining secret passwords. Days later, Nobutsuna ordered an intelligence gathering mission to determine the castle&#x27;s supplies. Several Kōga ninja—some apparently descended from those involved in the 1562 assault on an Imagawa clan castle—volunteered despite being warned that chances of survival were slim. A volley of shots was fired into the sky, causing the defenders to extinguish the castle lights in preparation. Under the cloak of darkness, ninja disguised as defenders infiltrated the castle, capturing a banner of the Christian cross. The Ukai diary writes,

As the siege went on, the extreme shortage of food later reduced the defenders to eating moss and grass. This desperation would mount to futile charges by the rebels, where they were eventually defeated by the shogunate army. The Kōga would later take part in conquering the castle:

With the fall of Hara Castle, the Shimabara Rebellion came to an end, and Christianity in Japan was forced underground. These written accounts are the last mention of ninja in war.

===Edo period===
After the Shimabara Rebellion, there were almost no major wars or battles until the &quot;bakumatsu&quot; era. To earn a living, ninja had to be employed by the governments of their &quot;Han&quot; (domain), or change their profession. Many lords still hired ninja, not for battle but as bodyguards or spies. Their duties included spying on other domains, guarding the daimyō, and fire patrol. A few domains like Tsu, Hirosaki and Saga continued to employ their own ninja into the &quot;bakumatsu&quot; era, although their precise numbers are unknown.

Many former ninja were employed as security guards by the Tokugawa shogunate, though the role of espionage was transferred to newly created organizations like the &quot;onmitsu&quot; and the &quot;oniwaban&quot;. Others used their &quot;ninjutsu&quot; knowledge to become doctors, medicine sellers, merchants, martial artists, and fireworks manufacturers. Some unemployed ninja were reduced to banditry, such as Fūma Kotarō and Ishikawa Goemon.

====Ninja stereotypes in theatre====

Many ubiquitous stereotypes about ninja were developed within Edo theatre. These include their black clothing, which was supposed to imitate the outfits worn by , stagehands meant to be ignored by the audience; and their use of , which was meant to contrast with the use of swords by onstage samurai. In kabuki theatre, ninja were &quot;dishonorable and often sorcerous counterparts&quot; to samurai, and possessed &quot;almost, if not outright, magical means of camouflage.&quot;

===Contemporary===
Between 1960 and 2010 artifacts dating to the Siege of Odawara (1590) were uncovered which experts say are ninja weapons. Ninja were spies and saboteurs and likely participated in the siege. The Hojo clan failed to save the castle from Toyotomi Hideyoshi forces. The uncovered flat throwing stones are likely predecessors of the shuriken. The clay caltrops preceded makibishi caltrops. Archeologist Iwata Akihiro of Saitama Prefectural Museum of History and Folklore said the flat throwing stones &quot;were used to stop the movement of the enemy who was going to attack [a soldier] at any moment, and while the enemy freezed the soldier escaped,&quot;. The clay caltrops could &quot;stop the movement of the enemy who invaded the castle,&quot; These weapons were hastily constructed yet effective and used by a &quot;battle group which can move into action as ninjas&quot;.

Mie University founded the world&#x27;s first research centre devoted to the ninja in 2017. A graduate master course opened in 2018. It is located in Iga (now Mie Prefecture). There are approximately 3 student enrollments per year. Students must pass an admission test about Japanese history and be able to read historical ninja documents. Scientific researchers and scholars of different disciplines study ancient documents and how it can be used in the modern world.

On June 19, 2022, Kōka city in Shiga Prefecture announced that a written copy of &quot;Kanrinseiyo&quot;, which is the original source of a famous book on the art of ninja called &quot;Bansenshukai&quot; (1676) from the Edo period was discovered in a warehouse of Kazuraki Shrine. The handwritten reproduction was produced in 1748. The book describes 48 types of ninjutsu. It has information about specific methods such as attaching layers of cotton to the bottom of straw sandals to prevent noise when sneaking around, attacking to the right when surrounded by a large number of enemies, throwing charred owl and turtle powder when trying to hide, and casting spells. It also clarified methods and how to manufacture and use ninjutsu tools, such as cane swords and &quot;makibishi&quot; (Japanese caltrop).

==Roles==
In his &quot;Buke Myōmokushō&quot;, military historian Hanawa Hokinoichi writes of the ninja:

===Espionage===
Espionage was the chief role of the ninja. With the aid of disguises, the ninja gathered information on enemy terrain and building specifications, as well as obtaining passwords and communiques. The aforementioned supplement to the &quot;Nochi Kagami&quot; briefly describes the ninja&#x27;s role in espionage:

Later in history, the Kōga ninja would become regarded as agents of the Tokugawa &quot;bakufu&quot;, at a time when the &quot;bakufu&quot; used the ninja in an intelligence network to monitor regional &quot;daimyōs&quot; as well as the Imperial court.

===Sabotage===
Arson was the primary form of sabotage practiced by the ninja, who targeted castles and camps.

The &quot;Tamon-in Nikki&quot; (16th century)—a diary written by abbot Eishun of Kōfuku-ji temple—describes an arson attack on a castle by men of the Iga clans.

In 1558, Rokkaku Yoshikata employed a team of ninja to set fire to Sawayama Castle. A &quot;chūnin&quot; captain led a force of 48 ninja into the castle by means of deception. In a technique dubbed &quot;bakemono-jutsu&quot; (&quot;ghost technique&quot;), his men stole a lantern bearing the enemy&#x27;s family crest (&quot;mon&quot;), and proceeded to make replicas with the same &quot;mon&quot;. By wielding these lanterns, they were allowed to enter the castle without a fight. Once inside, the ninja set fire to the castle, and Yoshitaka&#x27;s army would later emerge victorious. The mercenary nature of the &quot;shinobi&quot; is demonstrated in another arson attack soon after the burning of Sawayama Castle. In 1561, commanders acting under Kizawa Nagamasa hired three Iga ninja of &quot;genin&quot; rank to assist the conquest of a fortress in Maibara. Rokkaku Yoshitaka, the same man who had hired Iga ninja just years earlier, was the fortress holder—and target of attack. The &quot;Asai Sandaiki&quot; writes of their plans: &quot;We employed &quot;shinobi-no-mono&quot; of Iga... They were contracted to set fire to the castle&quot;. However, the mercenary &quot;shinobi&quot; were unwilling to take commands. When the fire attack did not begin as scheduled, the Iga men told the commanders, who were not from the region, that they could not possibly understand the tactics of the &quot;shinobi&quot;. They then threatened to abandon the operation if they were not allowed to act on their own strategy. The fire was eventually set, allowing Nagamasa&#x27;s army to capture the fortress in a chaotic rush.

===Countermeasures===
A variety of countermeasures were taken to prevent the activities of the ninja. Precautions were often taken against assassinations, such as weapons concealed in the lavatory, or under a removable floorboard. Buildings were constructed with traps and trip wires attached to alarm bells.

Japanese castles were designed to be difficult to navigate, with winding routes leading to the inner compound. Blind spots and holes in walls provided constant surveillance of these labyrinthine paths, as exemplified in Himeji Castle. Nijō Castle in Kyoto is constructed with long &quot;nightingale&quot; floors, which rested on metal hinges (&quot;uguisu-bari&quot;) specifically designed to squeak loudly when walked over. Grounds covered with gravel also provided early notice of unwanted intruders, and segregated buildings allowed fires to be better contained.

==Foreign ninja==
On February 25, 2018, Yamada Yūji, the professor of Mie University and historian Nakanishi Gō announced that they had identified three people who were successful in early modern Ureshino, including the ninja Benkei Musō (弁慶夢想). Musō is thought to be the same person as Denrinbō Raikei (伝林坊頼慶), the Chinese disciple of Marume Nagayoshi. It came as a shock when the existence of a foreign samurai was verified by authorities.

==Famous people==
Many famous people in Japanese history have been associated or identified as ninja, but their status as ninja is difficult to prove and may be the product of later imagination. Rumors surrounding famous warriors, such as Kusunoki Masashige or Minamoto no Yoshitsune sometimes describe them as ninja, but there is little evidence for these claims.

Some well known examples include:

* Kumawaka (the 16th century): a suppa (ninja) who served Obu Toramasa (1504– 1565), a vassal of Takeda Shingen.
* Hattori Hanzō (1542–1596): a samurai serving under Tokugawa Ieyasu. His ancestry in Iga province, along with &quot;ninjutsu&quot; manuals published by his descendants have led some sources to define him as a ninja. This depiction is also common in popular culture.
* Ishikawa Goemon (1558–1594): Goemon reputedly tried to drip poison from a thread into Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s mouth through a hiding spot in the ceiling, but many fanciful tales exist about Goemon, and this story cannot be confirmed.
* Fūma Kotarō (d. 1603): a ninja rumored to have killed Hattori Hanzō, with whom he was supposedly rivals. The fictional weapon &quot;Fūma shuriken&quot; is named after him.
* Momochi Sandayū (16th century): a leader of the Iga ninja clans, who supposedly perished during Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s attack on Iga province. There is some belief that he escaped death and lived as a farmer in Kii Province. Momochi is also a branch of the Hattori clan.
* Fujibayashi Nagato (16th century): considered to be one of three &quot;greatest&quot; Iga &quot;jōnin&quot;, the other two being Hattori Hanzō and Momochi Sandayū. Fujibayashi&#x27;s descendants wrote and edited the &quot;Bansenshukai&quot;.
* Katō Danzō (1503–1569): a famed 16th-century ninja master during the Sengoku period who was also known as &quot;Flying Katō&quot;.
* Wada Koremasa (1536–1571): a powerful Kōka samurai ninja who in 1568 allied with the Ashikaga shogunate and Oda Nobunaga, at which point he relocated to Settsu Province.
* Shimotsuge no Kizaru (16th century): an influential Iga ninja who in 1560 successfully led an attack on Tōichi Castle.
* Takino Jurobei (16th century): The commander of some of the final resistance against Oda Nobunaga in his invasion of Iga. Momochi Sandayu, Fujibayashi Nagato no Kami, and Hattori Hanzō served as his officers.

==In popular culture==

The image of the ninja entered popular culture in the Edo period, when folktales and plays about ninja were conceived. Stories about the ninja are usually based on historical figures. For instance, many similar tales exist about a &quot;daimyō&quot; challenging a ninja to prove his worth, usually by stealing his pillow or weapon while he slept. Novels were written about the ninja, such as &quot;Jiraiya Gōketsu Monogatari&quot;, which was also made into a kabuki play. Fictional figures such as Sarutobi Sasuke would eventually make their way into comics and television, where they have come to enjoy a culture hero status outside their original mediums.

Ninja appear in many forms of Japanese and Western popular media, including books (&quot;Kōga Ninpōchō&quot;), movies (&quot;Enter the Ninja&quot;, &quot;Revenge of the Ninja&quot;, &quot;Ninja Assassin&quot;), television (&quot;Akakage&quot;, &quot;The Master&quot;, &quot;Ninja Warrior&quot;), video games (&quot;Shinobi&quot;, &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot;, &quot;Tenchu&quot;, &quot;Sekiro&quot;, &quot;Ghost of Tsushima&quot;), anime (&quot;Naruto&quot;, &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot;, &quot;Gatchaman&quot;), manga (&quot;Basilisk&quot;, &quot;Ninja Hattori-kun&quot;, &quot;Azumi&quot;), Western animation (&quot;Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu&quot;) and American comic books (&quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;). From ancient Japan to the modern world media, popular depictions range from the realistic to the fantastically exaggerated, both fundamentally and aesthetically.

<text>The Rosary (; , in the sense of &quot;crown of roses&quot; or &quot;garland of roses&quot;), formally known as the Psalter of Jesus and Mary (Latin: Psalterium Jesu et Mariae), also known as the Dominican Rosary (as distinct from other forms of rosary such as the Franciscan Crown, Bridgettine Rosary, Rosary of the Holy Wounds, etc.), refers to a set of prayers used primarily in the Catholic Church, and to the physical string of knots or beads used to count the component prayers. When referring to the prayer, the word is usually capitalized (&quot;the Rosary&quot;, as is customary for other names of prayers, such as &quot;the Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot;, and &quot;the Hail Mary&quot;); when referring to the prayer beads as an object, it is written with a lower-case initial letter (e.g. &quot;a rosary bead&quot;).

The prayers that compose the Rosary are arranged in sets of ten Hail Marys, called &quot;decades&quot;. Each decade is preceded by one Lord&#x27;s Prayer (&quot;Our Father&quot;), and traditionally followed by one Glory Be. Some Catholics also recite the &quot;O my Jesus&quot; prayer after the Glory Be; it is the best-known of the seven Fátima prayers that appeared in the early 20th century. Rosary prayer beads are an aid for saying these prayers in their proper sequence.

Usually, five decades are recited in a session. Each decade provides an opportunity to meditate on one of the Mysteries of the Rosary, which recall events in the lives of Jesus Christ and his mother Mary.

In the 16th century Pope Pius V established a standard 15 Mysteries of the Rosary, based on long-standing custom. This groups the mysteries in three sets: the Joyful Mysteries, the Sorrowful Mysteries, and the Glorious Mysteries. In 2002, Pope John Paul II said it is fitting that a new set of five be added, termed the Luminous Mysteries, bringing the total number of mysteries to 20. The mysteries are prayed on specific days of the week; with the addition of the Luminous Mysteries on Thursday, the others are the Glorious on Sunday and Wednesday, the Joyful on Monday and Saturday, and the Sorrowful on Tuesday and Friday.

Over more than four centuries, several popes have promoted the Rosary as part of the veneration of Mary in the Catholic Church, and consisting essentially in meditation on the life of Christ. The rosary also represents the Catholic emphasis on &quot;participation in the life of Mary, whose focus was Christ&quot;, and the Mariological theme &quot;to Christ through Mary&quot;.

==Praying the Rosary==
===Basic structure===
The structure of the Rosary prayer, recited using the rosary beads, is as follows:

The Rosary is begun on the short strand:
* The Sign of the Cross (sometimes using the cross or crucifix);
* The Apostles&#x27; Creed (the cross or crucifix is held in the hand);
* The Lord&#x27;s Prayer at the first large bead (for the needs of the Catholic Church and the intentions of the reigning pope);
* The Hail Mary on each of the next three beads (for the three theological virtues: faith, hope, and charity);
* The Glory Be in the space before the next large bead; and
* The Lord&#x27;s Prayer at the second large bead.

The praying of the decades then follows, repeating this cycle for each mystery:
* Announcing the mystery (e.g. &quot;The First Glorious Mystery is the Resurrection of Jesus.&quot;);
* The Lord&#x27;s Prayer on the large bead;
* The Hail Mary on each of the ten adjacent small beads;
* The Glory Be on the space before the next large bead (often followed by the Fatima Prayer).

To conclude:
* The Hail Holy Queen (sometimes with other prayers, while holding the medal or large bead); and 
* The Sign of the cross.

===Variations and common additions===

Common pious additions to the Rosary are sometimes inserted after each decade and after recitation of the &quot;Salve Regina&quot;. Instead of ending each decade with the &quot;Gloria Patri&quot;, Pope Pius IX would add: &quot;May the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace.&quot;

Some Catholics piously add the Fatima Prayer after the &quot;Gloria Patri&quot;, still on the large bead. Some add the Miraculous Medal prayer which begins &quot;O Mary, conceived without sin...&quot;, while others add the Eucharistic prayer &quot;O Sacrament Most Holy, O Sacrament Divine, All praise and all thanksgiving be every moment Thine&quot; in honour of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament. In the practice of the Brothers of the Christian Schools, there is a sixth decade for the intentions of the students, or the Virgin Mary.

Other popular additions include the shorter form of the Prayer to Saint Michael; the &quot;Memorare&quot;, and a prayer for the intentions of the Pope. In many cases, the Litany of Loreto is recited before the end.

In the practice of the Dominican Order, the beginning prayers of the rosary correspond to the preces that begin the Divine Office:

# In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
# Hail Mary, full of grace, the is with Thee.
# Blessed art Thou among women, and Blessed is the Fruit of Thy Womb, Jesus.
# O , open my lips.
# And my mouth will proclaim Your praise.
# Incline Your aid to me, O God.
# O , make haste to help me.
# Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.

===Group recitation of the Rosary===
When a group recites the Rosary, it is customary that the prayers that constitute the decades are divided into two parts. The second part of the Our Father begins with &quot;Give us this day our daily bread&quot;; the second part of the Hail Mary begins with &quot;Holy Mary, Mother of God&quot;; and the second part of the Glory Be with &quot;As it was in the beginning&quot;. This lends itself to antiphonal prayer.

Sometimes, a chosen leader will recite the first half of the prayer while other participants recite the second. In another style, recitation of the first part of the prayers is rotated among different persons while still maintaining the traditional Leader-Congregation alternation.

==Mysteries of the Rosary==
The Mysteries of the Rosary are meditations on episodes in the life and death of Jesus from the Annunciation to the Ascension and beyond. These are traditionally grouped by fives into themed sets known as the &quot;Joyful&quot; (or &quot;Joyous&quot;) &quot;Mysteries&quot;, the &quot;Sorrowful Mysteries&quot;, and the &quot;Glorious Mysteries&quot;. Pope John Paul II recommended an additional set called the &quot;Luminous Mysteries&quot; (or the &quot;Mysteries of Light&quot;) in his apostolic letter &quot;Rosarium Virginis Mariae&quot; (October 2002).

Typically, a spiritual goal known as a &quot;fruit&quot; is also assigned to each mystery. Below are listed from the appendix of Louis Marie de Montfort&#x27;s book &quot;Secret of the Rosary&quot; for the original 15 mysteries, with other possible fruits being listed in other pamphlets bracketed:

1. The Annunciation. Fruit of the Mystery: Humility.

2. The Visitation. Fruit of the Mystery: Love of Neighbor.

3. The Birth of Jesus. Fruit of the Mystery: Poverty, Detachment from the things of the world, Contempt of Riches, Love of the Poor.

4. The Presentation of Jesus at the Temple. Fruit of the Mystery: Gift of Wisdom and Purity of mind and body (Obedience).

5. The Finding of Jesus in the Temple. Fruit of the Mystery: True Conversion (Piety, Joy of Finding Jesus).

The original &quot;Mysteries of Light&quot; were written by George Preca, the only Maltese official Catholic saint, and later reformed by the pope.

===Mysteries prayer schedule===
Traditionally the full Rosary consisted of praying all 15 traditional mysteries (Joyful, Sorrowful and Glorious) together. Alternatively, a single set of five mysteries can be prayed each day, according to the following convention:
==Devotions and spirituality==
Pope John Paul II placed the Rosary at the very center of Christian spirituality and called it &quot;among the finest and most praiseworthy traditions of Christian contemplation.&quot; Pope Pius XI is quoted as saying, for example, &quot;The Rosary is a powerful weapon to put the demons to flight.&quot;

Saints and popes have emphasized the meditative and contemplative elements of the rosary and provided specific teachings for how the rosary should be prayed, for instance the need for &quot;focus&quot;, &quot;respect&quot;, &quot;reverence&quot; and &quot;purity of intention&quot; during rosary recitations and contemplations. Scriptural meditations concerning the rosary are based on the Christian tradition of &quot;Lectio Divina&quot; (literally &quot;divine reading&quot;) as a way of using the Gospel to start a conversation between the person and Christ. Padre Pio, a rosary devotee, said: &quot;Through the study of books one seeks God; by meditation one finds him.&quot; From the sixteenth century onwards, Rosary recitations often involved &quot;picture texts&quot; that further assisted meditation. Such imagery continues to be used to depict the Mysteries of the rosary.

References to the Rosary have been part of various reported Marian Apparitions spanning two centuries. The reported messages from these apparitions have influenced the spread of Rosary devotion worldwide. In &quot;Quamquam pluries,&quot; Pope Leo XIII related Rosary devotions to Saint Joseph and granted indulgences in favour of Christians who, in the month of October, would have added the Prayer to Saint Joseph at the end of the Holy Rosary.

Praying the Rosary may be prescribed by priests as a type of penance after the Sacrament of Penance. Penance is not generally intended as a &quot;punishment&quot;; rather, it is meant to encourage meditation upon and spiritual growth from past sins.

==History==

Knotted prayer ropes were used in early Christianity; the Desert Fathers are said to have created the first such, using knots to keep track of the number of times they said the Jesus prayer or the 150 psalms.

According to pious tradition, the concept of the Rosary was given to Dominic of Osma in an apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mary during the year 1214 (1208?) in the church of Prouille, though in fact it was known from the ninth century in various forms. This Marian apparition received the title of Our Lady of the Rosary.

According to Herbert Thurston, it is certain that in the course of the twelfth century and before the birth of Dominic, the practice of reciting the &quot;Ave Maria&quot; 50 or 150 times had become generally familiar. According to 20th century editions of the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, the story of Dominic&#x27;s devotion to the Rosary and supposed apparition of Our Lady of the Rosary does not appear in any documents of the Catholic Church or the Order of Preachers (Dominicans) prior to the writings of the Dominican Alanus de Rupe (also Alan de la Roche), some 250 years after Dominic. However, recent scholarship by Donald H. Calloway seeks to refute this claim.

Leonard Foley said that although Mary&#x27;s giving the Rosary to Dominic is recognized as a legend, the development of this prayer form owes much to the Order of Preachers.

The practice of meditation during the praying of the Hail Mary is attributed to Dominic of Prussia (1382–1460), a Carthusian monk who termed it &quot;Life of Jesus Rosary&quot;. The German monk from Trier added a sentence to each of the 50 Hail Marys, using quotes from scripture (which at that time followed the name &quot;Jesus,&quot; before the intercessory ending was added during the Counter-Reformation). In 1569, the papal bull &quot;Consueverunt Romani Pontifices&quot; by the Dominican Pope Pius V officially established the devotion to the Rosary in the Catholic Church.

From the 16th to the early 20th century, the structure of the Rosary remained essentially unchanged. There were 15 mysteries, one for each of the 15 decades. According to John Henry Newman, Mariology is always Christocentric. During the 20th century, the addition of the Fatima Prayer to the end of each decade became common. There were no other changes until 2002, when John Paul II suggested the five optional Luminous Mysteries; variations of these had previously been proposed by George Preca, and were implemented during the mid-20th century by figures such as Patrick Peyton.

===Devotional growth===
Through the preaching of de Rupe, Rosary confraternities began to be erected shortly before 1475.

When Penal Laws in Ireland restricted or banned the Mass, the Rosary became a substitute prayer ritual within private homes. During the 18th century, de Montfort elaborated on the importance of the rosary and emphasized that it should be prayed with attention, devotion, and modesty (reverence).

In Brazil, two million men engage in a movement called (&quot;Men&#x27;s Rosary&quot;). It consists of weekly meetings to pray a set of mysteries. In neighboring Hispanic countries, the movement is called .

The theologian Romano Guardini described the Catholic emphasis on the Rosary as &quot;participation in the life of Mary, whose focus was Christ.&quot; This opinion was expressed earlier by Leo XIII who considered the rosary a way to accompany Mary in her contemplation of Christ.

==Papal endorsements==
During the 16th century, Pope Pius V associated the rosary with the General Roman Calendar by instituting the Feast of Our Lady of Victory (later changed to Our Lady of the Rosary), which is celebrated on 7 October.

Pope Leo XIII issued twelve encyclicals and five apostolic letters concerning the rosary and added the invocation &quot;Queen of the Most Holy Rosary&quot; to the Litany of Loreto. Leo XIII explained the importance of the Rosary as the one road to God from the faithful to the mother and from her to Christ, and through Christ to the Father, and that the Rosary was a vital means to participate with the life of Mary and to find the way to Christ. Leo instituted the custom of praying the Rosary daily during the month of October.

The Rosary as a family prayer was endorsed by Pope Pius XII in his encyclical &quot;Ingruentium malorum&quot;: &quot;In vain is a remedy sought for the wavering fate of civil life, if the family, the principle and foundation of the human community, is not fashioned after the pattern of the Gospel...We affirm that the custom of the family recitation of the Holy Rosary is a most efficacious means.&quot; Pope Pius XII and his successors actively promoted veneration of the Virgin in Lourdes and Fatima, which is credited with a new resurgence of the Rosary within the Catholic Church.

Pope John XXIII deemed the Rosary of such importance that on 28 April 1962, he issued an apostolic letter where he appealed for recitation of the Rosary in preparation for the Second Vatican Council.

Pope John Paul II issued the apostolic letter &quot;Rosarium Virginis Mariae&quot; which emphasized the Christocentric nature of the Rosary as a meditation on the life of Christ. He said: &quot;Through the Rosary the faithful receive abundant grace, as by the hands of the Mother of the Redeemer.&quot;

On 3 May 2008, Pope Benedict XVI stated that the Rosary was experiencing a new springtime: &quot;It is one of the most eloquent signs of love that the young generation nourish for Jesus and his Mother.&quot; For Benedict XVI, the Rosary is a meditation on all the important moments of salvation history.

The Congregation for Divine Worship&#x27;s directory of popular piety and the liturgy emphasizes the Christian meditation/meditative aspects of the rosary, and states that the Rosary is essentially a contemplative prayer which requires &quot;tranquility of rhythm or even a mental lingering which encourages the faithful to meditate on the mysteries of the Lord&#x27;s life.&quot; The Congregation for Divine Worship points out the role the Rosary can have as a formative component of spiritual life.

===Indulgence===
The &quot;Enchiridion Indulgentiarum&quot; of 2004 confirmed the partial indulgence for the Prayer to Saint Joseph. For the Marian Rosary he provided for plenary indulgence on condition that it is piously recited in a church or oratory (even alone), in a family, religious community, association of Christ&#x27;s faithful or, more generally, in a meeting of a plurality of people who come together honourable for this purpose.

==Rosary beads==
Rosary beads provide a physical method of keeping count of the number of Hail Marys said as the mysteries are contemplated. By not having to keep track of the count mentally, the mind is free to meditate on the mysteries. While most rosaries contain five groups of ten beads, called &quot;decades&quot;, some other rosaries, particularly those used by religious orders, contain fifteen decades and since the early 20th century twenty decade rosaries have been manufactured. 

Rosaries normally take the form of a loop from which hangs a short strand holding a crucifix or cross. The loop contains all the decades, the beads of which may be called Hail Mary beads as they are used for reciting the Hail Mary prayer, as well as one fewer Our Father beads, used for saying the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, than there are decades. To make them stand out to the user&#x27;s touch, Our Father beads are often larger, made of a different material, or spaced further apart from the Hail Mary beads. The pair of decades that do not have an Our Father bead between them instead have an attachment to a shorter strand of beads. This shorter strand has five beads on it and may connect to the main loop by a center medal, a knot or a large bead. The five beads are one Our Father bead, three Hail Mary beads, another Our Father bead then and finally a cross or crucifix. A five-decade rosary consists of a &quot;total&quot; of 59 beads. 

Although counting the prayers on a string of beads is customary, the prayers of the Rosary do not require beads, but can be said using any type of counting device, by counting on the fingers, or by counting mentally.

===Single-decade rosaries=== 

Single-decade rosaries can also be used: the devotee counts the same ring of ten beads repeatedly for every decade. During religious conflict in 16th- and 17th-century Ireland severe legal penalties were prescribed against practising Catholics. Small, easily hidden rosaries were thus used to avoid identification and became known as Irish penal rosaries. Sometimes rather than a cross, other symbols of specific meanings were used: a hammer to signify the nails of the cross, cords to represent the scourging, a chalice to recall the Last Supper, or a crowing rooster signifying the denial of Peter.

===Materials and distribution===
The beads can be made from any materials, including wood, bone, glass, crushed flowers, semi-precious stones such as agate, jet, amber, or jasper, or precious materials including coral, crystal, silver, and gold. Beads may be made to include enclosed sacred relics or drops of holy water. Rosaries are sometimes made from the seeds of the &quot;rosary pea&quot; or &quot;bead tree.&quot; Today, the vast majority of rosary beads are made of glass, plastic, or wood. It is common for beads to be made of material with some special significance, such as jet from the shrine of Saint James the Greater at Santiago de Compostela, or olive seeds from the Garden of Gethsemane. In rare cases, beads are made of expensive materials, from gold and silver, to mother of pearl and Swarovski black diamonds. Early rosaries were strung on thread, often silk, but modern ones are more often made as a series of chain-linked beads. Most rosaries used in the world today have simple and inexpensive plastic or wooden beads connected by cords or strings. Italy has a strong manufacturing presence in medium- and high-cost rosaries.

There are a number of rosary-making clubs around the world that make and distribute rosaries to missions, hospitals, prisons, etc. free of charge. Our Lady&#x27;s Rosary Makers produce some 7 million rosaries annually that are distributed to those deemed to be in economic and spiritual need.

==Wearing the rosary==
===Wearing rosary beads===
Rosary beads are often worn by Christians as a sign of their faith in various parts of the world, including the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, India, Palestine, and Uganda.

Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort encouraged Christians to also wear the rosary beads, stating that doing so &quot;eased him considerably.&quot; Many religious orders wear the rosary as part of their habit. A rosary hanging from the belt often forms part of the Carthusian habit.

Canon Law §1171 provides that sacred objects, which are designated for divine worship by dedication or blessing, are to be treated reverently and are not to be employed for profane or inappropriate use even if they are owned by private persons. As such, according to Edward McNamara, professor of liturgy at the Regina Apostolorum University:

If the reason for wearing a rosary is as a statement of faith, as a reminder to pray it, or some similar reason &quot;to the glory of God&quot;, then there is nothing to object to. It would not be respectful to wear it merely as jewelry. This latter point is something to bear in mind in the case of wearing a rosary around the neck. In the first place, while not unknown, it is not common Catholic practice. While a Catholic may wear a rosary around the neck for a good purpose, he or she should consider if the practice will be positively understood in the cultural context in which the person moves. If any misunderstanding is likely, then it would be better to avoid the practice ... Similar reasoning is observed in dealing with rosary bracelets and rings, although in this case there is far less danger of confusion as to meaning. They are never mere jewelry but are worn as a sign of faith.
===Wearing rosary rings===
A rosary ring is a finger ring with eleven knobs on it, ten round ones and one crucifix, representing one decade of a rosary. These and other kinds of religious rings were especially popular during the 15th and the 16th centuries. Rosary rings are sometimes given to Catholic nuns at the time of their solemn profession. Ring rosaries have also been used in cases of religious persecutions against Catholics, as they are small and can be easily hidden. An example is the Irish penal rosary also with 10 beads. However, they were also sometimes worn for protection and adornment at times when Catholicism was not persecuted, as it would be more difficult to break or wear down a rosary ring, rather than a traditional rosary threaded onto a string.

===Wearing rosary bracelets===
A rosary bracelet is one with ten beads and often a cross or medal. Another form is the rosary card. A rosary card is either one with a &quot;handle&quot; that moves like a slide rule to count the decade, or it has a whole rosary with bumps similar to Braille and ancient counting systems.

===Use in vehicles===
Many Christians hang rosaries from the rear-view mirror of their automobiles as a witness of their faith and protection as they drive.

===Use in homes===

Some households that cannot afford Christian artwork or a crucifix simply hang up a rosary as a focal point for prayer.

==Rosary recordings and products==

Audio recordings of the Rosary help with aspects of prayer such as pacing, memorization, and by providing inspirational meditations in the form of commentary. Some are sponsored by various groups such as the Knights of Columbus, and religious congregations. In 2008, Vatican Radio released a 4-CD set of Pope Benedict XVI praying the Rosary in Latin. Ecclesiastical Latin was used because “we have received requests not only from Italy but from places such as Germany and other countries. So we have used this language for the Rosary which everyone understands easily and because it is the universal language of the Church.”

In October 2019, the Vatican launched a US$109 &quot;electronic rosary&quot; with ten black agate and hematite beads, and a metal cross that detects movement. It is linked to the &quot;Click to Pray eRosary&quot; mobile app designed to help Catholic users pray for world peace and contemplate the Gospel. The rosary can be worn as a bracelet, and is activated by making the Sign of the cross. The app also gives visual and audio explanations of the Rosary.

==Rosary-based devotions==
* Novenas that include recitation of the Rosary are popular among Catholics. The traditional method consists of praying the Rosary along with the other component prayers of the Novena on nine consecutive days.
* The Servite Rosary – originated with the Servite Order, it consists of seven groups of seven beads. It is often said in connection with the Seven Dolours of Mary.
* The Franciscan Crown – a devotion that recalls seven joyful episodes in the life of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The practice originated among the Franciscans in early 15th-century Italy. The themes resemble the 12th-century &quot;Gaudes&quot;, Latin praises that ask Mary to rejoice because God has favoured her in various ways.
* 54-day Rosary Novena – consists of two parts, 27 days each. It is a series of Rosaries in honor of the Virgin Mary, reported as a private revelation in 1884 by Fortuna Agrelli in Naples, Italy. This Novena is performed by praying five decades of the Rosary each day for twenty-seven days in petition. The second phase which immediately follows consists of five decades each day for twenty-seven days in thanksgiving, and is prayed whether or not the petition has been granted. During the Novena, the meditations rotate among the Joyful, Sorrowful, and Glorious mysteries.
* Peace Rosary – also known as the &quot;Workers&#x27; Rosary&quot; or the &quot;Peace Chaplet&quot;, it is popular with devotees of Our Lady of Medjugorje. The Chaplet later became a basis for a prayer for the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit, known as the Chaplet in Honour of the Holy Spirit, and has been translated into many languages.

==Other denominations==
Many similar prayer practices exist in other Christian communities, each with its own set of prescribed prayers and its own form of prayer beads (known in some traditions as the &quot;Chotki&quot;), such as the prayer rope in Eastern Orthodox Christianity. These other devotions and their associated beads are usually referred to as &quot;chaplets&quot;. The Rosary is sometimes prayed by other Christians, especially in Lutheranism, the Anglican Communion, and the Old Catholic Church.

Another example of Rosary-based prayers includes the non-denominational Ecumenical Miracle Rosary, &quot;a set of prayers and meditations which covers key moments in the New Testament.&quot;

===Lutheranism===
A minority of Lutherans pray the Rosary. However, while using the Catholic format of the Rosary, each &quot;Hail Mary&quot; is replaced with the &quot;Jesus Prayer&quot;. The only time the &quot;Hail Mary&quot; is said is at the end of the Mysteries on the medal, where it is then replaced with the &quot;Pre-Trent&quot; version of the prayer (which omits &quot;Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death&quot;). The final &quot;Hail Mary&quot; can also be replaced by reciting of either the &quot;Magnificat&quot;, or Martin Luther&#x27;s &quot;Evangelical Praise of the Mother of God.&quot;

The Wreath of Christ is used in the Lutheran Church of Sweden. While an official order and rubric for its use exists, it is often used as a tool for reflection and meditation rather than recitation of specific prayers or devotions, often as part of Confirmation classes. Some members of the Church of Sweden of high-church or evangelical catholic churchmanship will pray the traditional rosary, sometimes in an ecumenical setting with Roman Catholics.

===Anglicanism===

The use of the Catholic Rosary is fairly common among Anglicans of Anglo-Catholic churchmanship. Many Anglo-Catholic prayer books and manuals of devotion, such as Saint Augustine&#x27;s Prayer Book contain the Catholic Rosary along with other Marian devotions. The public services of the Anglican churches, as contained in the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, do not directly invoke the Blessed Virgin or any other saint in prayer as the Thirty-Nine Articles reject the practice of praying to saints, but many Anglo-Catholics feel free to do so in their private devotions. Anglicans who pray the Catholic Rosary tend not to use the Luminous Mysteries or the Fátima decade prayer.

Anglican prayer beads, also known informally as the &quot;Anglican rosary&quot;, are a recent innovation created in the 1980s. They consist of four &quot;weeks&quot; (the equivalent of a decade) of seven beads each. The weeks are separated from each other by single beads termed &quot;cruciform beads&quot;. A variety of different prayers may be said, the most common being the Jesus Prayer. Anglican Prayer Beads are not a Marian devotion, and there are no appointed meditations. Although it is sometimes called the &quot;Anglican rosary&quot;, it is distinct from the Rosary of Our Lady as prayed by Catholics, Lutherans, Anglicans, and other Western Christians.

==Churches named for the Holy Rosary==
Catholic Marian church buildings around the world named in honor of the rosary include: 

* The Shrine of the Virgin of the Rosary of Pompei in Italy. 

* &quot;Our Lady of the Rosary Basilica&quot; in the archdiocesan seat of Rosario province, Argentina.

* The Sanctuary of Our Lady of the Rosary of San Nicolás in the neighboring sufragan diocese of San Nicolás de los Arroyos.

* Our Lady of Pompeii in New York City, which is named for the Our Lady of the Rosary of Pompeii.

* The &quot;Rosary Basilica&quot; in Lourdes, &quot;Nossa Senhora do Rosário&quot; in Porto Alegre, Brazil

* The Chapel of the Virgin of the Rosary (1531–1690) in Puebla City, Mexico.

* in San Diego, California.

==In Marian art==
Since the 16th century, the rosary began to appear as an element in Catholic Marian art. One notable depiction of the rosary in Marian art is seen in Caravaggio&#x27;s &quot;Madonna of the Rosary&quot; oil canvas painting in Vienna. Other depictions are shown below.
==Use by Christian nationalists==
A 2022 opinion piece in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, an American magazine and multi-platform publisher, linked Catholic rosary beads to Christian nationalism, radical traditional Catholicism and &quot;extremist&quot; right wing movements in the United States. The article raised concerns of anti-Catholic sentiment and disrespecting people of faith.

<text>Ionia ( ) was an ancient region encompassing the central part of the western coast of Anatolia. It consisted of the northernmost territories of the Ionian League of Greek settlements. Never a unified state, it was named after the Ionians who had settled in the region before the archaic period.

Ionia proper comprised a narrow coastal strip from Phocaea in the north near the mouth of the river Hermus (now the Gediz), to Miletus in the south near the mouth of the river Maeander, and included the islands of Chios and Samos. It was bounded by Aeolia to the north, Lydia to the east and Caria to the south. The cities within the region figured significantly in the strife between the Persian Empire and the Greeks.

Ionian cities were identified by mythic traditions of kinship and by their use of the Ionic dialect, but there was a core group of twelve Ionian cities that formed the Ionian League and had a shared sanctuary and festival at Panionion. These twelve cities were (from south to north): Miletus, Myus, Priene, Ephesus, Colophon, Lebedos, Teos, Erythrae, Clazomenae and Phocaea, together with the islands of Samos and Chios. Smyrna, originally an Aeolic colony, was afterwards occupied by Ionians from Colophon, and became an Ionian city.

The Ionian school of philosophy, centered on 6th century BC Miletus, was characterized by a focus on non-supernatural explanations for natural phenomena and a search for rational explanations of the universe, thereby laying the foundation for scientific inquiry and rational thought in Western philosophy.

==Geography==

Ionia was of small extent, not exceeding in length from north to south, with the cities located on a narrow band between the sea and the mountains, which varies in width from . So intricate is the coastline that the voyage along its shores was estimated at nearly four times the direct distance. The location of the eastern border with Lydia and Caria was vague in antiquity.

The region comprised three extremely fertile valleys formed by the outflow of three rivers, among the most considerable in Asia Minor: the Hermus in the north, flowing into the Gulf of Smyrna, though at some distance from the city of that name; the Caÿster (modern Küçük Menderes River), which flowed past Ephesus; and the Maeander, which in ancient times discharged its waters into a deep gulf between Priene and Miletus, but which has been gradually filled up by this river&#x27;s deposits.

Two east–west mountain ranges divide the region and extend out into the Aegean as peninsulas. The first begins as Mount Sipylus between the Hermus and Caÿster river valleys and continues out as the Erythrae peninsula, which faces the island of Chios. The second is the Messogis range between the Caÿster and Maeander ranges, which becomes the Mycale peninsula, which reaches out towards the island of Samos. None of these mountain ranges exceed .

Ionia enjoyed the reputation in ancient times of being the most fertile region of Asia Minor. Herodotus declares &quot;in terms of climate and weather, there is no fairer region in the whole world.&quot;

==Etymology==
The etymology of the word () or () is uncertain. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain its origins. Frisk suggests that it stems from an unknown root, *&quot;Ia&quot;-, which would be pronounced as *&quot;ya&quot;-. There are several alternative hypotheses as well:

*The word may have originated from a Proto-Indo-European onomatopoeic root *&#x27; or *&#x27;, which conveyed a shout made by individuals rushing to help others. Another proposition, put forth by Pokorny, suggests that * could signify &quot;devotees of Apollo,&quot; based on the cry uttered in his worship; the god was also called himself.
*The word may have derived from an early name associated with an unknown nation inhabiting an Eastern Mediterranean island. This population was referred to as in ancient Egyptian, indicating the people residing in that region. However, the exact nature of this early name and its connection to the term remains uncertain.
*It may have come from a Proto-Indo-European root *&#x27;, meaning &quot;power.&quot;
The term () in turn became the source for words for Greeks in many languages of the Near East, compare Aramaic (*), Hebrew (), Arabic (), Demotic Egyptian (/wəjˈniːn/) and Coptic ().

==History==
From the 18th century BC the region was a part of the Hittite Empire with possible name Arzawa, which was destroyed by invaders during the 12th century BC together with the collapse of the Empire. Ionia was settled by the Greeks probably during the 11th century BC. The most important city was Miletus (the &quot;Millawanda/Milawata&quot; of Hittites). There is no record of any people named Ionians in Late Bronze Age Anatolia but Hittite texts record contact with Ahhiyawans (&quot;Achaeans&quot;) without being clear on their location. Miletus and some other cities founded earlier by non-Greeks received populations of Mycenaean Greeks.

===Settlement===

Greek settlement of Ionia seems to have accelerated following the Bronze Age collapse, but the lack of contemporary sources makes the sequence of events unclear.

The ancient Greeks believed that the Ionians were the descendants of Ion (either a son or grandson of Hellen, the mythical ancestor of the Greeks) and had migrated from Greece to Asia Minor in mythic times. The story is attested from the Classical period. Herodotus states that in Asia the Ionians kept the division into twelve cities that had prevailed in Ionian lands of the north Peloponnese, their former homeland, which became Achaea after they left. However, the story of the migration is recounted most fully by the Roman-period authors Strabo and Pausanias. They report that the Ionians were expelled from the Peloponnese by Achaians, and were granted refuge in Athens by King Melanthus. Later, when Medon was selected as King of Athens, his brothers, the &quot;sons of Codrus&quot;, led a group of Ionians and others to Asia Minor. Simultaneously, the Aeolians of Boeotia settled the coast to the north of the Ionians and the Dorians settled in Crete, the Dodecanese and in Caria.

According to Pausanias, the sons of Codrus were as follows:
*Neileus conquered Miletus from the Cretans. Pausanias and most other sources present Neileus as the overall leader of the Ionians.
*Androclus conquered Ephesus from the Leleges and Lydians, conquered Samos, and died defending Priene from Carians. Strabo says that Androclus was the leader of the Ionians and the only legitimate son of Codrus.
*Cyaretus took Myus from the Carians. 
*Damasichthon and Promethus found the descendants of Thersander of Thebes at Colophon and settled alongside them, but later Promethus killed his brother and fled to Naxos.
*Andraemon conquered Lebedus from the Carians. 
*Damasus and Naoclus settled at Teos, along with Boeotians led by Geres. The city had already been settled by Ionians under Apoecus (whose name literally means &quot;founder&quot;) and Minyans who settled under Athamas. 
*Cleopus gathered a group made up of equal portions from all the Ionian cities and settled them at Erythrae, where there were already Cretans, Lycians, Carians and Pamphylians. 
Pausanias reports that other cities were founded or became Ionian later:
* Priene was founded by Neileus&#x27; son Aegyptus, along with Philotas, as a joint Ionian and Theban settlement. 
*Clazomenae was founded by a group of Ionians, who received Parphorus, a descendant of Codrus from Colophon as their founder. 
*Phocaea was founded by a group of Phocians from near Delphi, led by Philogenes and Damon of Athens and then received Deoetes, Periclus and Abartus, descendants of Codrus, as their kings in order to gain recognition as Ionians. 
*Procles son of Pityreus of Epidaurus, a descendant of Ion, who had been expelled by Argos conquered Samos. Under his son Leogorus, the Ephesians under Androclus conquered the island and the Samians fled to Samothrace and to Anaea, but then reconquered Samos. 
*Chios was settled by Cretans under Oenopion, then by Carians and Abantes from Euboea. Oenopion&#x27;s grandson Hector drove them out and received a tripod and the right to sacrifice at the Panionion from the Ionians (Pausanias expresses uncertainty about how this made them Ionian). 
*Smyrna had been conquered by the Aeolians, but was later conquered by the Colophonians.

===Archaic period===

In the Archaic period, &quot;the Ionian poleis were among the cultural, intellectual, and political leaders of the Greek world.&quot; The region prospered economically due to the contributions of immigrants, traders, and other social classes from at least 750 BCE to well after 510 BCE.

====Ionian League====

The twelve Ionian cities formed a religious and cultural (as opposed to a political or military) confederacy, the Ionian League, of which participation in the Pan-Ionic festival was a distinguishing characteristic. This festival took place on the north slope of Mt. Mycale in a shrine called the Panionium. The foundation took place late in the Archaic period, but the exact date is unclear. This is also when stories of the Ionian migration are first attested. All of these initiatives were probably aimed at emphasising Ionian distinctiveness from other Greeks in Asia.

But the Ionian League was primarily a religious organisation rather than a political one. Although they did sometimes act together, civic interests and priorities always trumped broader Ionian ones. They never formed a real confederacy. The advice of Thales of Miletus to combine in a political union was rejected. In inscriptions and literary sources from this period, Ionians generally identify themselves by their city of origin, not as &quot;Ionians.&quot;

====Ionians overseas====
The cities became prosperous. Miletus especially was, in an early period, one of the most important commercial cities of Greece, and in its turn became the parent of numerous other colonies, which extended all around the shores of the Euxine Sea and the Propontis from Abydus and Cyzicus to Trapezus and Panticapaeum. Phocaea was one of the first Greek cities whose mariners explored the shores of the western Mediterranean. From an early period, Ephesus, though it did not send out any colonies of importance, became a flourishing city.

In the eighth century, Ionian Greeks are recorded in Near Eastern sources as coastal raiders: an inscription of Sargon II (ca 709–07, recording a naval expedition of 715) boasts &quot;in the midst of the sea&quot; he had &quot;caught the Ionians like fish and brought peace to the land of Que Cilicia and the city of Tyre&quot;. For a full generation earlier, Assyrian inscriptions had recorded troubles with the Ionians, who escaped on their boats.

====Lydian rule====
About 700 BC Gyges, first Mermnad king of Lydia, invaded the territories of Smyrna and Miletus, and is said to have taken Colophon. His son Ardys conquered Priene. In the middle of the 7th century, the Cimmerii ravaged a great part of Asia Minor, including Lydia, and sacked Magnesia on the Maeander, but were defeated when they attacked Ephesus. It was not until the reign of Croesus (560–545 BC) that the cities of Ionia fell completely under Lydian rule.

===First Achaemenid rule===
The defeat of Croesus by Cyrus the Great was followed by the conquest of all the Ionian cities in 547 BC. These became subject to the Persian monarchy with the other Greek cities of Asia, forming part of the satrapy of Lydia. In this position they enjoyed a considerable amount of autonomy, but were subject to local despots (called &quot;tyrants&quot;), who were loyal to the Persian king.

Art and archaeology show that Ionia was characterised by &quot;openness and adaptability&quot; towards the Lydians, Persians, and their eastern neighbours in this period. Lydian products and luxury objects were widespread.

The Persians used &quot;Yaunā&quot; (Ionian) as a catch-all term for all Greeks, dividing them into &quot;Yaunā of the mainland&quot; in Asia Minor, &quot;Yaunā dwelling by the sea&quot; in the Aegean islands, &quot;Yaunā dwelling across the sea&quot; in the Greek mainland, and &quot;Yaunā with shields on their heads&quot; in Macedonia.

====Ionian revolt====
It was at the instigation of one of the tyrants, Histiaeus of Miletus, that in about 500 BC the principal cities ignited the Ionian Revolt against Persia. They were at first assisted by the Athenians and Eretria, with whose aid they penetrated into the interior and burnt Sardis, an event which ultimately led to the Persian invasion of Greece. But the fleet of the Ionians was defeated off the island of Lade, and the destruction of Miletus after a protracted siege was followed by the reconquest of all the Asiatic Greeks, insular as well as continental.

===Athenian empire===

The victories of the Greeks during the Persian invasion of Greece and the liberation of Thrace, Macedon, and Ionia from the Persian Empire had the effect of enfranchising their kinsmen on the other side of the Aegean, and the Battle of Mycale (479 BC), in which the defeat of the Persians was in great measure owing to the Ionians, secured their emancipation. They henceforth became the dependent allies of Athens within the Delian League. In the Athenian tribute lists, one of the regions of the empire is the &quot;Ionikos phoros&quot;, a region that includes the cities of Ionia, but also Aeolis and Mysia to the north. Caria to the south was initially its own region, but was folded into the Ionikos phoros in 438 BC.

The Athenians advanced an expansive definition of Ionian identity, which included most of the communities under their control and emphasised common descent from Athens. This was probably intended to legitimise their rule over the region. It clashed with the restrictive definition of Ionian identity that was maintained by the Ionian League.

Herodotus, who came from Halicarnassus, a Dorian city in southwestern Asia Minor which was also part of the Athenian Empire, writes in opposition to the Ionian League&#x27;s claims that &quot;it would be stupid to say that they are more truly Ionian or better born ...&quot; He lists other ethnic populations among the settlers: Abantes from Euboea, Minyans from Orchomenus, Cadmeians, Dryopians, Phocians, Molossians, Arcadian Pelasgians, Dorians of Epidaurus, and others. Even &quot;the best born of the Ionians&quot; had married girls from Caria. He defines Ionians as all peoples who were descended from Athenians and celebrated the Apaturia festival, which aligns with the expansive Athenian definition of Ionian identity.

===Satrapy (387–335 BC)===

The Spartans dissolved the Athenian Empire at the end of the Peloponnesian War in 404 BC. The Spartans installed harmosts (governors) in the cities, but had to withdraw them because they had promised Ionia and the other Greek communities in Asia to the Persians. In 401, the Ionian cities and Sparta supported Cyrus the Younger, the Persian overlord of Asia Minor, in his attempt to seize the throne from his brother, King Artaxerxes II but he failed. Artaxerxes tasked Tissaphernes, the satrap of Lydia and Caria, with retaking the Ionian cities, and the Spartans opposed him.

In 396 BC, Agesilaus led a large expedition to Asia Minor to defend the cities and attack the Persians, which landed in Ephesus. From there he invaded Phrygia and Lydia, sacking Sardis in 395 BC. But the outbreak of the Corinthian War forced him to withdraw in 395 BC.

The region was under Persian control by about 390 BC, when the Persian satrap arbitrated a boundary dispute between Miletus and Myus. Sparta, Athens, and the other mainland Greek states formally acknowledged Persian possession of Ionia and the other Greek cities in Asia Minor in the Peace of Antalcidas in 387 BC. In this period, Ionia was a separate satrapy, rather than part of Lydia - the only time in the region&#x27;s history that formed an administrative unit. Ionian cities appear to have retained a considerable amount of autonomy until the conquest of Asia Minor by Alexander the Great in 335 BC.

===Hellenistic period===

Ephesus was conquered by Philip II of Macedon in 336 BC in preparation for the invasion of Persia, which took place under his son Alexander the Great. After the battle of the Granicus in 334 BC most of the Ionian cities submitted to Alexander, except for Miletus, which was taken only after a long siege. Alexander presented his invasion as a liberation of the Greeks of Asia and therefore treated the Ionians generously, granting them freedom, autonomy, and tax-free status.

In the conflict that broke out between Alexander&#x27;s successors after his death in 323 BC and throughout the Hellenistic Age that followed, Ionia was a contested territory, divided between the Antigonid, Seleucid, and Ptolemaic kingdoms. Cities were regularly forced to switch allegiance from one monarch to another, but they were also able to play the kings off against one another in order to get better terms for themselves. Despite the political situation, the Ionian League continued to operate throughout the period.

Following their victory in the War with Antiochus in 189 BC, the Romans placed Ionia under the control of the Attalid Kingdom, which retained the region until it was annexed by Rome in 133 BC.

One of the major theatrical associations of the Hellenistic period was the Synod of the Dionysiac Artists of Ionia and the Hellespont, which was established around 250 BC and had its headquarters successively in Teos, Ephesus, Myonnesus, and Lebedus.

===Roman empire===

Ionia became part of the Roman province of Asia in 133 BC, which had its capital at the Ionian city of Ephesus. Ionia had no formal place in the Roman administration of the province, which was divided into conventus districts that were totally distinct from the traditional ethnic divisions of the region. However, the Ionian League continued to function in this period.

The geographer Strabo treats Ionia as the narrow coastal strip from the Hermus river in the north to the Maeander river in the south (though noting that other authorities included the plain south of the river). He treats Ephesus as its most important city and presents an unbroken tradition of intellectual culture in the region stretching from the Archaic philosophers down to his own day - in contrast to the intellectual life of mainland Greece, which he presents as a thing of the past. Other authors sometimes use &quot;Ionia&quot; as a metonym for the whole province of Asia.

Decreased political agency for the Greek cities under Rome, led to increased focus on cultural identity as a source of civic prestige. In the fierce rivalries that raged between the cities of the Province of Asia in the Roman Imperial period, Ionian cities emphasised their Ionian identity as &quot;one of the purest, &#x27;primordial&#x27; forms of Greekness,&quot; while their rivals denounced Ionians as overly influenced by oriental luxury and recalled their support for the Persians in the late fifth and early fourth centuries BC. Most sources discussing Ionian founding myths belong to this period. Ionian cities retained local month names and continued to count years by eponymous magistrates rather than adopting era dating like most other cities in Asia Minor. Distinctive Ionian personal names remained common.

===Medieval and modern history===
Greeks continued to live in Ionia through the Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman Empires but were forced to vacate the region in 1922 after the events of the Greek genocide which culminated with the population exchange between Turkey and Greece. The suburbs of Nea Ionia and Nea Smyrni were primarily settled by refugees from Ionia and still maintain an Ionian identity.

==Legacy==
From the 7th century BC, Ionia, and in particular Miletus, was home to the Ionian school of philosophy. The Ionian school, founded by Thales and his student Anaximander, pioneered a revolution in traditional thinking about Nature. Instead of explaining natural phenomena by recourse to traditional religion/myth, the cultural climate was such that men began to form hypotheses about the natural world based on ideas gained from both personal experience and deep reflection. According to physicist Carlo Rovelli, this was the &quot;first great scientific revolution&quot; and the earliest example of critical thinking, which would come to define Greek, and subsequently modern, thought.

Ionia has a long roll of distinguished men of letters and science (notably the Ionian School of philosophy) and distinct school of art. This school flourished between 700 and 500 BC. The great names of this school are Theodorus and Rhoecus of Samos; Bathycles of Magnesia on the Maeander; Glaucus of Chios, Melas, Micciades, Archermus, Bupalus and Athenis of Chios. Notable works of the school still extant are the famous archaic female statues found on the Athenian Acropolis in 1885–1887, the seated statues of Branchidae, the Nike of Archermus found at Delos, and the objects in ivory and electrum found by D. G. Hogarth in the lower strata of the Artemision at Ephesus.

The Persian designation for Greek is &quot;Younan&quot; (یونان), a transliteration of &quot;Ionia&quot;, through Old Persian &quot;Yauna&quot;. The same is true for the Hebrew word, &quot;Yavan&quot; (יוון) and the Sanskrit word &quot;yavana&quot;. The word was later adopted in Arabic, Turkish, and Urdu as well as in other places.

Ionia appears as the major setting in these novels:
*&quot;The Ionia Sanction&quot; (2011), by Gary Corby
*&quot;The Ionian Mission&quot; (1981), by Patrick O&#x27;Brian

Many scholars believe the biblical Yavan refers to the alleged ancestor of the ancient peoples of Ionia.

<text>Jane Seymour (born Joyce Penelope Wilhelmina Frankenberg; 15 February 1951) is a British actress. After making her screen debut as an uncredited teenage extra in the 1969 musical comedy &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot;, Seymour moved to roles in film and television, including a leading role in the television series &quot;The Onedin Line&quot; (1972–1973) and the role of psychic Bond girl Solitaire in the James Bond film &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1973).

Critical acclaim followed, with a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series for her role in &quot;Captains and the Kings&quot; (1976). In 1982, Seymour won her first Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television for her role in the miniseries &quot;East of Eden&quot; (1981). She received three additional Golden Globe nominations in that same category: one for her portrayal of Wallis Simpson, the twice-divorced American wife of King Edward VIII, in the television film &quot;The Woman He Loved&quot; (1988), and another two (in consecutive years) for her role in the miniseries &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; (1988-1989). Her &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; role also garnered her a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Special. 

Seymour also won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or Special for her portrayal of Maria Callas in &quot;&quot; (1988). 

In 1993, Seymour was cast as Dr. Michaela Quinn in the television series &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot;, a medical drama set in the Wild West. For her performance in this role, over the course of its six-season run she received nominations twice for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, twice for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series, and four times for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Television Series – Drama. She went on to win one of the latter awards.

Seymour was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and, in 2000, was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire.

Seymour also had roles in numerous films, including &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; (1980), &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; (1982), &quot;La Révolution française&quot; (1989), &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot; (2005), &quot;Love, Wedding, Marriage&quot; (2011), &quot;Little Italy&quot; (2018), &quot;The War with Grandpa&quot; (2020) and &quot;Friendsgiving&quot; (2020).

In addition to her acting career, Seymour established a nonprofit, the Open Hearts Foundation, co-authored several children&#x27;s books and self-help books, and created jewellery, scarves, furniture, rugs, handbags, paintings and sculptures under the label &quot;Jane Seymour Designs&quot;.

==Early life==
Joyce Penelope Wilhelmina Frankenberg was born on 15 February 1951 in Uxbridge, Middlesex (now part of Greater London), England, to Mieke van Tricht (1914–2007), a nurse, and Benjamin John Frankenberg FRCOG (19141990), a distinguished gynaecologist and obstetrician. Her father was Jewish; he was born in England to a family from Nowe Trzepowo, a village in Poland. Her mother was a Dutch Protestant (with family from Deventer) who was a prisoner of war during World War II and had lived in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). Seymour has stated she learned Dutch from her mother and her fellow survivors from the Japanese internment camp, who frequently spent holidays together in the Netherlands when she was a child. Encouraged by her parents (who sent her to live with family friends in Geneva to practise her languages), she learned to speak fluent French.

Seymour&#x27;s paternal grandfather Lee Grahame had come to live in the East End of London after escaping the Czarist pogroms when he was 14. He is listed in the 1911 census as living in Bethnal Green working as a hairdresser and went on to establish his own company. Seymour&#x27;s father Benjamin qualified at the UCL Medical School in 1938. He joined the medical branch of the RAFVR after the outbreak of war, serving in England, Belgium, Italy and South Africa, ending his service as a squadron leader with a mention in despatches. After the war, Frankenberg continued his career at various London hospitals, including St Leonard&#x27;s Hospital, Hackney, the East End Maternity Hospital, the City of London Maternity Hospital and finally Hillingdon Hospital, for which he designed the maternity unit. A close associate of Patrick Steptoe, he assisted in pioneering discussions on in-vitro fertilisation and published papers on adolescent and teenage sexual behaviours.

Seymour was educated at Tring Park School for the Performing Arts in Hertfordshire. She chose the screen name Jane Seymour, after the English queen Jane Seymour, because it seemed more saleable. One of Seymour&#x27;s notable features is heterochromia, making her right eye brown and her left eye green.

==Acting career==
In 1969, Seymour appeared uncredited in her first film, Richard Attenborough&#x27;s &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot;. In 1970, Seymour appeared in her first major film role in the war drama &quot;The Only Way&quot;. She played Lillian Stein, a Jewish woman seeking shelter from Nazi persecution. In 1973, she gained her first major television role as Emma Callon in the successful 1970s series &quot;The Onedin Line&quot;. During this time, she appeared as the female lead Prima in the two-part television miniseries &quot;Frankenstein: The True Story&quot;. She appeared as Winston Churchill&#x27;s girlfriend Pamela Plowden in &quot;Young Winston&quot;, produced by her father-in-law Richard Attenborough.

In 1973, Seymour achieved international fame in her role as Bond girl Solitaire in the James Bond film &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;. IGN ranked her as 10th in a Top 10 Bond Babes list. In 1975, Seymour was cast as Princess Farah in &quot;Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger&quot;, the third part of Ray Harryhausen&#x27;s &quot;Sinbad&quot; trilogy. Filmed in 1975, it was not released until its stop motion animation sequences had been completed in 1977. In 1978, she appeared as Serina in the &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; film and in the first five episodes of the television series. Seymour returned to the big screen in the comedy &quot;Oh Heavenly Dog&quot; opposite Chevy Chase.
In 1980, Seymour played the role on stage of Constanze in Peter Shaffer&#x27;s play &quot;Amadeus&quot;, opposite Ian McKellen as Salieri and Tim Curry as Mozart. The play premiered on Broadway in 1980, ran for 1,181 performances and was nominated for seven Tony Awards, of which it won five.

Also in 1980, Seymour was given the role of young theatre actress Elise McKenna in the period romance &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;. Though the film was made with a markedly limited budget, the role enticed Seymour with a character she felt she knew. The effort was a decided break from her earlier work and marked the start of her friendship with co-star Christopher Reeve.

In 1981, she appeared in the television film &quot;East of Eden&quot;, based on the novel by John Steinbeck. Her portrayal of main antagonist Cathy Ames won her a Golden Globe. In 1982, she appeared in &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; with Anthony Andrews and her &quot;Amadeus&quot; costar Ian McKellen. In 1984, Seymour appeared nude in the film &quot;Lassiter&quot;, co-starring Tom Selleck, but the film was a box office flop. In 1987, Seymour was the subject of a pictorial in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, although she did not pose nude.

In 1988, Seymour got the female lead in the twelve-part television miniseries &quot;War and Remembrance&quot;, the continued story from the miniseries &quot;The Winds of War&quot;. She played Natalie Henry, an American Jewish woman trapped in Europe during World War II. That same year, she won an Emmy Award for playing Maria Callas in the television movie &quot;&quot;.

In 1989, on the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution, Seymour appeared in the television film &quot;La révolution française&quot;, filmed in both French and English. Seymour appeared as the doomed French queen, Marie Antoinette; Seymour&#x27;s two children, Katherine and Sean, appeared as the queen&#x27;s children.
In the 1990s, Seymour earned popular and critical praise for her role as Dr. Michaela &quot;Mike&quot; Quinn in the television series &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot; and its television sequels (1993–2001). Her work on the series earned her a second Golden Globe Award. While working on the series &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot;, she met her fourth husband, actor-director James Keach.

In the 2000s, Seymour continued to work primarily in television. In 2004 and 2005, she made six guest appearances in The WB series &quot;Smallville&quot;, playing Genevieve Teague, the wealthy, scheming mother of Jason Teague (Jensen Ackles). In 2005, Seymour returned to the big screen in the comedy &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot;, playing Kathleen Cleary, wife of fictional United States Secretary of the Treasury William Cleary, played by Christopher Walken. In spring 2006, she appeared in the short-lived The WB series &quot;Modern Men&quot;. Later that year, Seymour guest-starred as a law school professor on an episode of the CBS sitcom &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; and as a wealthy client on the Fox legal drama &quot;Justice&quot;. In 2007, she guest-starred in the ABC sitcom &quot;In Case of Emergency&quot;. She also appeared in ITV&#x27;s &quot;Marple: Ordeal By Innocence&quot;, based on the Agatha Christie novel. She was a contestant on season five of the US reality show &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;; she finished in sixth place, along with her partner Tony Dovolani. Seymour guest starred in &quot;One Life to Lose&quot;, a soap opera-themed episode of the ABC crime dramedy &quot;Castle&quot;.

Seymour appeared in the Hallmark Channel film &quot;Dear Prudence&quot; (2008); the romantic comedy &quot;Love, Wedding, Marriage&quot; (2011); and the Hallmark Movie Channel film &quot;Lake Effects&quot; (2012).

In April 2016, she starred as Florence Lancaster in Noël Coward&#x27;s play &quot;The Vortex&quot;, presented in Singapore by the British Theatre Playhouse. In 2022, Seymour began playing the title role on the Irish&lt;ref name=&quot;variety/1234950720&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Acorn TV series &quot;Harry Wild.&quot;

In 2020, Jane starred in Ruby&#x27;s Choice, an Australian comedy/drama produced and directed by Michael Budd. It follows Ruby (played by Seymour) as a woman with early dementia and its impact on her and her family when she is no longer able to live independently and moves in with her family. Jane won Australian screen industry Network Award for best actress.

The film was released theatrically across Australia and New Zealand on 3 March 2022. On 7 March 2022, Ruby&#x27;s Choice premiered in Santa Barbara, California at the 37th Santa Barbara International Film Festival where it was a Nominee Best International Feature Film.

==Personal life==

Seymour has been married and divorced four times. Her first marriage was to Michael Attenborough. She was then briefly married to Geoffrey Planer.

In 1981, Seymour married David Flynn. The marriage produced two children: Katherine Flynn (born on 7 February 1982) and Sean Flynn (born on 31 July 1985). Flynn had involved her in the housing market, an involvement which left her &quot;completely beyond bankrupt&quot;. They divorced in 1992. The following year, Seymour married actor James Keach. Together they had twins, John Stacy and Kristopher Steven, born on 30 November 1995, and named after family friends Johnny Cash and Christopher Reeve and James&#x27;s brother, actor Stacy Keach.

In February 2005, Seymour became a naturalised citizen of the United States.

Seymour is a celebrity ambassador for Childhelp, a national nonprofit organisation dedicated to helping victims of child abuse and neglect. In 2007, she sponsored a children&#x27;s Art Pillow contest as part of the Jane Seymour Collection, with the proceeds going to Childhelp.

On 12 April 2013, it was announced that Seymour was divorcing Keach. The divorce was finalized in December 2015.

In February 2018, she posed for &quot;Playboy&quot; for a third time, becoming at the age of 67 the oldest woman to be photographed for the magazine. In the &quot;Playboy&quot; interview, Seymour revealed that she briefly quit acting after being sexually harassed by an unnamed film producer in the early 1970s.

Since 2023, she has been in a relationship with musician John Zambetti.

==Writing and fashion career==

In the 1980s, Seymour began a parallel career as a writer of self-help and inspirational books, including &quot;Jane Seymour&#x27;s Guide to Romantic Living&quot; (1986), &quot;Two at a Time: Having Twins&quot; (2002), &quot;Remarkable Changes&quot; (2003) and &quot;Among Angels&quot; (2010). She also co-wrote several children&#x27;s books, with her then-husband James Keach, for the &quot;This One &#x27;N That One&quot; series. 

In 1985, Seymour appeared at Fashion Aid, a one-time fashion show fundraiser held at the Royal Albert Hall in London. An event organised by Bob Geldof to raise funds for the ongoing Ethiopian famine caused by the policies of dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam, the finale of the show saw her partake in a mock wedding with Freddie Mercury. Seymour wore a white lace wedding dress that was designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel – who had previously created Princess Diana&#x27;s wedding gown.

In 2008, Seymour replaced Selina Scott as the new face of fashion label CC (formerly known as Country Casuals) under the Austin Reed banner of retailers.

Likewise in 2008, Seymour teamed up with and designed the &quot;Open Heart Collection&quot; for Kay Jewelers, which promoted it with the advice, &quot;Keep your heart open and love will &quot;always&quot; find its way in.&quot; Beginning that year, she saw to it that she would always be wearing one of the collection&#x27;s necklaces whenever seen in public while not in character for any of her acting performances. In the same year, Seymour also wrote and published the books &quot;Open Hearts: If Your Heart Is Open, love Will Always Find Its Way In&quot; and &quot;Open Hearts Family.&quot;

A 2.08-carat cushion-cut fancy vivid blue diamond in an 18-karat rose-gold-plated platinum setting was named &quot;The Jane Seymour&quot; in her honour by World of Diamonds Group, which had mined it in Russia, cut and set it. The ring was presented to Seymour in April 2016 in Singapore while she was there to star in &quot;The Vortex&quot;.

<doc id="46403" wikidata="Q852395" url="?curid=46403" title="Passover Seder">
<text>The Passover Seder is a ritual feast at the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Passover. It is conducted throughout the world on the eve of the 15th day of Nisan in the Hebrew calendar (i.e., at the start of the 15th; a Hebrew day begins at sunset). The day falls in late March or in April of the Gregorian calendar. Passover lasts for seven days in Israel and, among most customs, eight days in the Jewish diaspora. Where seven days of Passover are observed, a seder is held on the first night; where eight days are observed, seders are often held on the first two nights, the 15th and 16th of Nisan. The Seder is a ritual involving a retelling of the story of the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt, taken from the Book of Exodus () in the Torah. The Seder itself is based on the Biblical verse commanding Jews to retell the story of the Exodus from Egypt: &quot;You shall tell your child on that day, saying, &#x27;It is because of what the did for me when I came out of Egypt. (Exodus 13:8) At the seder, Jews read the text of the Haggadah, an ancient Tannaitic work. The Haggadah contains the narrative of the Israelite exodus from Egypt, special blessings and rituals, Talmudic commentaries, and Passover songs.

Seder customs include telling the story, discussing the story, drinking four cups of wine, eating matzah, partaking of symbolic foods, and reclining in celebration of freedom. The Seder is among the most commonly celebrated Jewish rituals, performed by Jews all over the world.

==Etymology==
&quot;Seder&quot; is a transliteration of the Hebrew סדר, which means &#x27;order&#x27; or &#x27;procedure&#x27;. The name also expresses the conduct of the meal, all the dishes, the blessings, the prayers, the stories and the songs, written in the Haggadah, a book that determines the order of Passover and tells the story of the Exodus from Egypt. And all the mitzvot (religious commandments or rites) in the &quot;order&quot; are done in a fixed order in every Jewish home.

# () &quot;Exalt!&quot; – recital of the Hallel, traditionally recited on festivals; drinking of the fourth cup of wine
# () &quot;Desired&quot; – say &quot;Next Year in Jerusalem!&quot;

The Seder is most often conducted in the family home, although communal Seders are also organized by synagogues, schools and community centers, some open to the general public. It is customary to invite guests, especially strangers and the needy. The Seder is integral to Jewish faith and identity: as explained in the Haggadah, if not for divine intervention and the Exodus, the Jewish people would still be slaves in Egypt. Therefore, the Seder is an occasion for praise and thanksgiving and for re-dedication to the idea of liberation. Furthermore, the words and rituals of the Seder are a primary vehicle for the transmission of the Jewish faith from grandparent to child, and from one generation to the next. Attending a Seder and eating matzah on Passover is a widespread custom even among those who are not religiously observant.
Family members come to the table dressed in their holiday clothes. There is an Orthodox Ashkenazi tradition for the person leading the Seder to wear a white robe called a kittel. For the first half of the Seder, each participant will only need a plate and a wine glass. At the head of the table is a Seder plate containing various symbolic foods that will be eaten or pointed out during the course of the Seder. Placed nearby is a plate with three matzot and dishes of salt water for dipping.

Each participant receives a copy of the Haggadah: an ancient text that contains the complete Seder service. Men and women are equally obliged and eligible to participate in the Seder. Traditionally, each participant at the Seder table recites the Haggadah in the original Hebrew and Aramaic. Halakha (the collective body of Jewish religious laws) requires that certain parts be said in language the participants can understand, and critical parts are often said in both Hebrew and the native language. The leader will often interrupt the reading to discuss different points with his or her children, or to offer an insight into the meaning or interpretation of the words.

In some homes, participants take turns reciting the text of the Haggadah, in the original Hebrew or in translation. It is traditional for the head of the household and other participants to have pillows placed behind them for added comfort. At several points during the Seder, participants lean to the left – when drinking the four cups of wine, eating the Afikoman, and eating the korech sandwich.

Jews generally observe one or two seders: in Israel, one seder is observed on the first night of Passover; traditional Diaspora communities (to the general exception of Reform and Reconstructionist Jews) also hold a seder on the second night. Seders have been observed around the world, including in remote places such as high in the Himalaya mountains in Kathmandu, Nepal.

==Themes of the Seder==

===Slavery and freedom===

The rituals and symbolic foods evoke the twin themes of the evening: slavery and freedom. It is stated in the Haggadah that &quot;In every generation everyone is obligated to see themselves as if they themselves came out of Egypt&quot; – i.e., out of slavery.

The rendering of time for Jews is that a day began at sunset and ended at sunset. According to the Exodus narrative, at the beginning of the 15th of Nisan in Ancient Egypt, the Jewish people were enslaved to Pharaoh. After the tenth plague struck Egypt at midnight, killing all the first-born sons from the first-born of Pharaoh to the first-born of the lowest Egyptian to all the first-born of the livestock in the land (Exodus 12:29), Pharaoh let the Hebrew nation go, effectively making them free people for the second half of the night.

Thus, Seder participants recall the slavery that reigned during the first half of the night by eating matzah (the &quot;poor person&#x27;s bread&quot;), maror (bitter herbs which symbolize the bitterness of slavery), and charoset (a sweet paste, possibly representing the mortar which the Jewish slaves used to cement bricks). Recalling the freedom of the second half of the night, they eat the matzah (the &quot;bread of freedom&quot; as well as the &quot;bread of affliction&quot;) and &#x27;afikoman&#x27;, and drink the four cups of wine, in a reclining position, and dip vegetables into salt water (the dipping being a sign of royalty and freedom).

===The Four Cups===
There is an obligation to drink four cups of wine during the Seder. The Mishnah says (Pesachim 10:1) that even the poor are obliged to drink the four cups. Each cup is imbibed at a specific point in the Seder. The first is for Kiddush (), the second is for &#x27;Maggid&#x27; (), the third is for Birkat Hamazon () and the fourth is for Hallel ().


The Four Cups represent the four expressions of deliverance promised by God Exodus 6:6–7: &quot;I will bring out,&quot; &quot;I will deliver,&quot; &quot;I will redeem,&quot; and &quot;I will take.&quot;

The Vilna Gaon relates the Four Cups to four worlds: this world, the Messianic age, the world at the revival of the dead, and the world to come. The MaHaRaL connects them to the four Matriarchs: Sarah, Rebeccah, Rachel, and Leah. (The three matzot, in turn, are connected to the three Patriarchs: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.) Abarbanel relates the cups to the four historical redemptions of the Jewish people: the choosing of Abraham, the Exodus from Egypt, the survival of the Jewish people throughout the exile, and the fourth which will happen at the end of days.

The four cups might also reflect the Roman custom of drinking as many cups as there are letters in the name of the chief guest at a meal, which in the case of the Seder is God himself whose Hebrew name has four letters.

===Seder plate===

The special Passover Seder plate () is the special plate containing symbolic foods used during the Passover Seder. Each of the six items arranged on the plate has special significance to the retelling of the story of the Exodus from Egypt. The seventh symbolic item used during the meal – a stack of three matzot – is placed on its own plate on the Seder table.

The six items on the Seder plate are:
* &quot;Maror&quot;: Bitter herbs, which Gamaliel says symbolize the bitterness and harshness of the slavery which the Jews endured in Ancient Egypt. For &quot;maror&quot;, many people use freshly grated horseradish or whole horseradish root.
* &quot;Chazeret&quot; is typically romaine lettuce, whose roots are bitter-tasting. In addition to horseradish and romaine lettuce, other forms of bitter lettuce, such as endive, may be eaten in fulfillment of the mitzvah, as well as green onions, dandelion greens, celery leaves, or curly parsley (but parsley and celery are more commonly used as the karpas or vegetable element). Much depends upon whether one&#x27;s tradition is Ashkenazic, Sephardic, Mizrahi, Persian, or one of the many other Jewish ethno-cultural traditions.
* &quot;Charoset&quot;: A sweet, brown, pebbly paste of fruits and nuts, possibly representing the mortar used by the Jewish slaves to build the storehouses of Egypt. The actual recipe depends partly on ethno-cultural tradition and partly on locally available ingredients. Ashkenazi Jews, for example, traditionally make apple-raisin based charoset while Sephardic Jews often make date-based recipes that might feature orange or/and lemon, or even banana. Other Talmudic traditions claim the Charoset &quot;recalls the apple&quot;, apparently referencing a tradition that Jewish women snuck out to apple orchards to conceive in Egypt, and that it is not obligatory but serves to nullify the poison of the maror.
* &quot;Karpas&quot;: A vegetable other than bitter herbs, sometimes parsley or celery or cooked potato, which is dipped into salt water (Ashkenazi custom), vinegar (Sephardi custom), or charoset (Yemenite Jews) at the beginning of the Seder.
* &quot;Zeroa&quot;: A roasted lamb or goat bone, symbolizing the (Pesach sacrifice), which was a lamb offered in the Temple in Jerusalem and was then roasted and eaten as part of the meal on Seder night.
* &quot;Beitzah&quot;: A roast egg – usually a hard-boiled egg that has been roasted in a baking pan with a little oil, or with a lamb shank – symbolizing the (festival sacrifice) that was offered in the Temple in Jerusalem and was then eaten as part of the meal on Seder night.

===Focus on the children===
Since the retelling of the Exodus to one&#x27;s child is the object of the Seder experience, much effort is made to arouse the interest and curiosity of the children and keep them awake during the meal. To that end, questions and answers are a central device in the Seder ritual. By encouraging children to ask questions, they will be more open to hearing the answers.

The most famous question which the youngest child asks at the Seder is the – &#x27;Why is this night different from all other nights?&#x27; After the asking of this questions, the main portion of the Seder, &quot;Magid&quot;, discusses the answers in the form of a historical review. Also, at different points in the Seder, the leader of the Seder will cover the matzot and lift their cup of wine; then put down the cup of wine and uncover the matzot – all to elicit questions from the children.

In some traditions, the questions are asked by the assembled company in chorus rather than by a child, and are put to the leader of the seder, who either answers the question or may direct the attention of the assembled company to someone who is acting out that particular part of the Exodus. Physical re-enactment of the Exodus during the Passover seder is common in many families and communities.

Families will follow the Haggadah&#x27;s lead by asking their own questions at various points in the Haggadah and offering prizes such as nuts and candies for correct answers. The &quot;afikoman&quot;, which is hidden away for the &quot;dessert&quot; after the meal, is another device used to encourage children&#x27;s participation. In most families, the leader of the Seder hides the &quot;afikoman&quot; and the children must find it, whereupon they receive a prize or reward. In other homes, the children hide the &quot;afikoman&quot; and a parent must look for it; when the parents give up, the children demand a prize (often money) for revealing its location.

==Order of the Seder==
The order and procedures of the Seder are stated and printed in the text of the Passover Haggadah, a copy of which is in front of all participants. Jewish children learn the following words, denoting the order of the Seder, with a rhyme and tune at their Jewish schools:

=== (blessings and the first cup of wine)===
 () is Hebrew Imperative for . It should be recited as soon as the synagogue services are over but not before nightfall. This is similar to that which is recited on all of the Three Pilgrimage Festivals, but also refers to matzot and the exodus from Egypt. Acting in a way that shows freedom and majesty, many Jews have the custom of filling each other&#x27;s cups at the Seder table. The is traditionally said by the father of the house, but all Seder participants may participate by reciting the and drinking at least a majority of the first cup of wine. On Shabbat, it is preceded by a reading from the Book of Genesis recounting God&#x27;s rest on the seventh day of creation and includes an extended doxology on the blessings of Shabbat.

=== (wash hands)===
Technically, according to Jewish law, whenever one partakes of fruits or vegetables dipped in liquid while remaining wet, one must wash one&#x27;s hands if the fruit or vegetable remains wet. However, at other times of the year, one has either already washed their hands before eating bread, or dry the fruit or vegetable, in which case one need not wash their hands before eating the fruit or vegetable.

According to most traditions, no blessing is recited at this point in the Seder, unlike the blessing recited over the washing of the hands before eating bread. However, followers of Rambam or the Gaon of Vilna do recite a blessing.

=== (appetizer)===
Each participant dips a vegetable into either salt water (an Ashkenazi custom; said to serve as a reminder of the tears shed by their enslaved ancestors), vinegar (a Sephardi custom) or charoset (an older Sephardi custom, still common among Yemenite Jews). Another custom mentioned in some Ashkenazi sources and probably originating with Meir of Rothenburg, was to dip the karpas in wine.

=== (breaking of the middle matzah)===
Three matzot are stacked on the seder table; at this stage, the middle matzah of the three is broken in half. The larger piece is hidden, to be used later as the &quot;afikoman&quot;, the &quot;dessert&quot; after the meal. The smaller piece is returned to its place between the other two matzot.

Moroccan Jewish custom is that when the matzah is split, a passage is recited describing how &quot;in this manner God split the Red Sea&quot; in the aftermath of the Exodus.

Before Magid, some Sephardi families have a custom to sing (translated: &#x27;In haste we left Egypt&#x27;). While this is being sung, the head of the household walks around the table with the Seder plate and waves it over each individual&#x27;s head.

=== (relating the Exodus)===
The story of Passover, and the change from slavery to freedom is told. At this point in the Seder, Moroccan Jews have a custom of raising the Seder plate over the heads of all those present while chanting (&#x27;In haste we went out of Egypt [with our] bread of affliction, [now we are] free people&#x27;).

==== (invitation to the Seder) ====

The matzot are uncovered, and referred to as the &quot;bread of affliction&quot;. Participants declare (in Aramaic) an invitation to all who are hungry or needy to join in the Seder. Halakha requires that this invitation be repeated in the native language of the country.

==== (The Four Questions) ====
The Mishna details questions one is obligated to ask on the night of the seder. It is customary for the youngest child present to recite the four questions. Some customs hold that the other participants recite them quietly to themselves as well. In some families, this means that the requirement remains on an adult &quot;child&quot; until a grandchild of the family receives sufficient Jewish education to take on the responsibility. If a person has no children capable of asking, the responsibility falls to their spouse, or another participant. The need to ask is so great that even if a person is alone at the seder they are obligated to ask themselves and to answer their own questions.

# (&#x27;Why is this night different from all other nights?&#x27;)
# (&#x27;Why is it that on all other nights during the year we eat either leavened bread or matza, but on this night we eat only matza?&#x27;)
# (&#x27;Why is it that on all other nights we eat all kinds of vegetables, but on this night we eat bitter herbs?&#x27;)
# (&#x27;Why is it that on all other nights we do not dip [our food] even once, but on this night we dip them twice?&#x27;)
# (&#x27;Why is it that on all other nights we dine either sitting upright or reclining, but on this night we all recline?&#x27;)

The question about reclining substitutes for a question about eating roasted meat, that was present in the mishnah but removed by later authorities due to its inapplicability after the destruction of the temple:

Roasted sacrifices were no longer possible after the destruction, and roasted meat was therefore disallowed on seder night, to avoid ambiguity.

The questions are answered with the following:
# &#x27;We eat only matzah because our ancestors could not wait for their breads to rise when they were fleeing slavery in Egypt, and so they were flat when they came out of the oven.&#x27;
# &#x27;We eat only Maror, a bitter herb, to remind us of the bitterness of slavery that our ancestors endured while in Egypt.&#x27;
# &#x27;The first dip, green vegetables in salt water, symbolizes the replacing of our tears with gratitude, and the second dip, Maror in Charoses, symbolizes the sweetening of our burden of bitterness and suffering.&#x27;
# &#x27;We recline at the Seder table because in ancient times, a person who reclined at a meal was a free person, while slaves and servants stood.&#x27;
# &#x27;We eat only roasted meat because that is how the Pesach/Passover lamb is prepared during sacrifice in the Temple at Jerusalem.&#x27;

The four questions have been translated into over 300 languages.

==== The Four Sons ====
The traditional Haggadah speaks of &quot;four sons&quot; – one who is wise, one who is wicked, one who is simple, and one who does not know to ask. This is based upon the rabbis of the Jerusalem Talmud finding four references in the Torah to responding to your son who asks a question. Each of these sons phrases his question about the seder in a different way. The Haggadah recommends answering each son according to his question, using one of the three verses in the Torah that refer to this exchange.

The wise son asks &quot;What are the statutes, the testimonies, and the laws that God has commanded us to do?&quot; One explanation for why this very detailed-oriented question is categorized as wise, is that the wise son is trying to learn how to carry out the seder, rather than asking for someone else&#x27;s understanding of its meaning. He is answered fully:
&quot;You should reply to him with [all] the laws of pesach: one may not eat any dessert after the paschal sacrifice.&quot;

The wicked son, who asks, &quot;What is this service to you?&quot;, is characterized by the Haggadah as isolating himself from the Jewish people, standing by objectively and watching their behavior rather than participating. Therefore, he is rebuked by the explanation that &quot;It is because God acted for sake when left Egypt.&quot; (This implies that the Seder is not for the wicked son because the wicked son would not have deserved to be freed from Egyptian slavery.) Where the four sons are illustrated in the Haggadah, this son has frequently been depicted as carrying weapons or wearing stylish contemporary fashions.

The simple son, who asks, &quot;What is this?&quot; is answered with &quot;With a strong hand the Almighty led us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage.&quot;

The one who does not know to ask is told, &quot;It is because of what the Almighty did for me when I left Egypt.&quot;

Some modern Haggadahs mention &quot;children&quot; instead of &quot;sons&quot;, and some have added a fifth child. The fifth child can represent the children of the Shoah who did not survive to ask a question or represent Jews who have drifted so far from Jewish life that they do not participate in a Seder.

For the former, tradition is to say that for that child one asks &quot;Why?&quot; and, like the simple child, has no answer.

==== &quot;Go and learn&quot; ====
Four verses in Deuteronomy (26:5–8) are then expounded, with an elaborate, traditional commentary based on the Sifre. (&quot;And thou shalt speak and say before the Lord thy God: &#x27;A wandering Aramean was my parent, and they went down into Egypt, and sojourned there, few in number; and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous. And the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage. And we cried unto the Lord, the God of our parents, and the Lord heard our voice, and saw our affliction, and our toil, and our oppression. And the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders.&quot;)

The Haggadah explores the meaning of those verses, and elaborates on the story. This telling describes the slavery of the Jewish people and their miraculous salvation by God. This culminates in an enumeration of the Ten Plagues:

# (blood) – All the water was changed to blood
# (frogs) – An infestation of frogs sprang up in Egypt
# (lice) – The Egyptians were afflicted by lice
# (wild animals) – An infestation of wild animals (some say flies) sprang up in Egypt
# (pestilence) – A plague killed off the Egyptian livestock
# (boils) – An epidemic of boils afflicted the Egyptians
# (hail) – Hail rained from the sky
# (locusts) – Locusts swarmed over Egypt
# (darkness) – Egypt was covered in darkness
# (killing of the first-born) – All the first-born sons of the Egyptians were slain by God

With the recital of the Ten Plagues, there is a late custom, which arose in German-Jewish circles, that each participant removes a drop of wine from their cup using a fingertip at the mention of each of the ten plagues. Although this night is one of salvation, Don Isaac Abravanel explains that one cannot be completely joyous when some of God&#x27;s creatures had to suffer. A mnemonic acronym for the plagues is also introduced: , while similarly spilling a drop of wine for each word.

At this part in the Seder, songs of praise are sung, including the song &quot;Dayenu&quot;, which proclaims that had God performed any single one of the many deeds performed for the Jewish people, it would have been enough to obligate us to give thanks. Some sing instead &quot;The Women&#x27;s Dayenu&quot;, a feminist variant of &quot;Dayenu&quot;, by Michele Landsberg.

After &quot;Dayenu&quot; is a declaration (mandated by Rabban Gamliel) of the reasons of the commandments of the Paschal lamb, Matzah, and Maror, with scriptural sources. Then follows a short prayer, and the recital of the first two psalms of Hallel (which will be concluded after the meal). A long blessing is recited, and the second cup of wine is drunk.

=== (ritual washing of hands)===
The ritual hand-washing is repeated, this time with all customs including a blessing.

=== (blessings over the Matzah)===
Two blessings are recited.

First one recites the standard blessing before eating bread, which includes the words &quot;who brings forth&quot; ( in Hebrew).

===&quot;Matzah&quot;===
Then one recites the blessing regarding the commandment to eat Matzah.

An olive-size piece (some say two) is then eaten while reclining to the left.

===&quot;Maror&quot; (bitter herbs)===
The blessing for the eating of the maror (bitter herbs) is recited and then it is to be eaten.

===&quot;Korech&quot; (sandwich)===
The maror (bitter herb) is placed between two small pieces of matzo, similarly to how the contents of a sandwich are placed between two slices of bread, and eaten. This follows the tradition of Hillel, who did the same at his Seder table 2000 years ago (except that in Hillel&#x27;s day the Paschal sacrifice, matzo, and maror were eaten together.)

===&quot;Shulchan Orech&quot; (the meal)===

The festive meal is eaten. Traditionally it begins with a hard boiled egg dipped in salt water, referencing the charred egg on the Seder plate. In Yiddish, there is a saying: , which means &quot;We set the table and eat the fish&quot;.

===&quot;Tzafun&quot; (eating of the &quot;afikoman&quot;)===

The &quot;afikoman&quot;, which was hidden earlier in the Seder, is traditionally the last morsel of food eaten by participants in the Seder.

Each participant receives an olive-sized portion of matzo to be eaten as &quot;afikoman&quot;. After the consumption of the &quot;afikoman&quot;, traditionally, no other food may be eaten for the rest of the night. Additionally, no intoxicating beverages may be consumed, with the exception of the remaining two cups of wine.

===&quot;Bareich&quot; (Grace after Meals)===
The recital of Birkat Hamazon.
==== &quot;Kos Shlishi&quot; (the Third Cup of Wine) ====
The drinking of the Third Cup of Wine.

Note: The Third Cup is customarily poured before the Grace after Meals is recited because the Third Cup also serves as a Cup of Blessing associated with the Grace after Meals on special occasions.

==== &quot;Kos shel Eliyahu ha-Navi&quot; (cup of Elijah the Prophet); Miriam&#x27;s cup ====
In many traditions, the front door of the house is opened at this point. Psalms 79:6–7 is recited in both Ashkenazi and Sephardi traditions, plus Lamentations 3:66 among Ashkenazim.

Most Ashkenazim have the custom to fill both a fourth and a fifth cup at this point. This relates to a Talmudic discussion that concerns the number of cups that are supposed to be drunk. Given that the four cups are in reference to the four expressions of redemption in Exodus 6:6–7, some rabbis felt that it was important to include a fifth cup for the fifth expression of redemption in Exodus 6:8. All agreed that five cups should be poured but the question as to whether or not the fifth should be drunk, given that the fifth expression of redemption concerned being brought into the Land of Israel, which – by this stage – was no longer possessed of an autonomous Jewish community, remained insoluble. The rabbis determined that the matter should be left until Elijah (in reference to the notion that Elijah&#x27;s arrival would precipitate the coming of the Moshiach (Jewish Messiah), at which time all halakhic questions will be resolved) and the fifth cup came to be known as the &quot;Kos shel Eliyahu&quot; (&quot;Cup of Elijah&quot;). Over time, people came to relate this cup to the notion that Elijah will visit each Jewish home on Seder night as a foreshadowing of his future arrival at the end of the days, when he will come to announce the coming of the Moshiach, and that the door is opened for him to enter.

Some seders (including the original Women&#x27;s Seder, but not limited to women-only seders) now set out a cup for the prophet Miriam as well as the traditional cup for the prophet Elijah, sometimes accompanied by a ritual to honor Miriam. Miriam&#x27;s cup originated in the 1980s in a Boston Rosh Chodesh group; it was invented by Stephanie Loo, who filled it with mayim hayim (living waters) and used it in a feminist ceremony of guided meditation. Miriam&#x27;s cup is linked to the &quot;midrash&quot; of Miriam&#x27;s well, which &quot;is a rabbinic legend that tells of a miraculous well that accompanied the Israelites during their 40 years in the desert at the Exodus from Egypt&quot;.

===&quot;Hallel&quot; (songs of praise)===
The entire order of Hallel which is usually recited in the synagogue on Jewish holidays is also recited at the Seder table, albeit sitting down. The first two psalms, 113 and 114, were recited before the meal. The remaining psalms 115–118, are recited at this point. Psalm 136 (the Great Hallel) is then recited, followed by &quot;Nishmat&quot;, a portion of the morning service for Shabbat and festivals.

There are a number of opinions concerning the paragraph &quot;Yehalelukha&quot; which normally follows Hallel, and &quot;Yishtabakh&quot;, which normally follows &quot;Nishmat&quot;. Most Ashkenazim recite &quot;Yehalelukha&quot; immediately following the Hallel proper, i.e. at the end of Psalm 118, except for the concluding words. After Nishmat, they recite &quot;Yishtabakh&quot; in its entirety. Sephardim recite &quot;Yehalelukha&quot; alone after Nishmat.

Afterwards the Fourth Cup of Wine is drunk and a brief blessing for the &quot;fruit of the vine&quot; is said.

===&quot;Nirtzah&quot;===

The Seder concludes with a prayer that the night&#x27;s service be accepted. A hope for the Messiah is expressed: &quot;&quot;L&#x27;shanah haba&#x27;ah b&#x27;Yerushalayim!&quot; – Next year in Jerusalem!&quot; Jews in Israel, and especially those in Jerusalem, recite instead &quot;&quot;L&#x27;shanah haba&#x27;ah b&#x27;Yerushalayim hab&#x27;nuyah!&quot; – Next year in the rebuilt Jerusalem!&quot; Jerusalem is the holiest city in the Bible; it has become symbolic of the idea of spiritual perfection. The tradition of saying &quot;Next year in Jerusalem&quot; is similar to the tradition of opening the door for Elijah: it recognizes that “this year” we live in an imperfect world outside of “Jerusalem,” but we patiently await a time, hopefully “next year,” in which we live in spiritual perfection.

Although the 15 orders of the Seder have been complete, the Haggadah concludes with additional songs which further recount the miracles that occurred on this night in Ancient Egypt as well as throughout history. Some songs express a prayer that the Beit Hamikdash will soon be rebuilt. The last song to be sung is &quot;Chad Gadya&quot; (&quot;One Kid Goat&quot;). This seemingly childish song about different animals and people who attempted to punish others for their crimes and were in turn punished themselves, was interpreted by the Vilna Gaon as an allegory to the retribution God will levy over the enemies of the Jewish people at the end of days.

Following the Seder, those who are still awake may recite the Song of Songs, engage in Torah learning, or continue talking about the events of the Exodus until sleep overtakes them.

==Non-traditional Seders==

===Feminist Seders===
In 1976, the first of a series of women-only Passover seders was held in Esther M. Broner&#x27;s New York City apartment and led by her, with 13 women attending, including Gloria Steinem, Letty Cottin Pogrebin, and Phyllis Chesler. Esther Broner and Naomi Nimrod created a women&#x27;s haggadah for use at this seder. In the spring of 1976 Esther Broner published this &quot;Women&#x27;s Haggadah&quot; in Ms. Magazine, later publishing it as a book in 1994; this haggadah is meant to include women where only men had been mentioned in traditional haggadahs, and it features the Wise Women, the Four Daughters, the Women&#x27;s Questions, the Women&#x27;s Plagues, and a women-centric &quot;Dayenu&quot;. The original Women&#x27;s Seder has been held with the Women&#x27;s Haggadah every year since 1976, and women-only seders are now held by some congregations as well. Some seders (including the original Women&#x27;s Seder, but not limited to women-only seders) now set out a cup for the prophet Miriam as well as the traditional cup for the prophet Elijah, accompanied by a ritual to honor Miriam. Miriam&#x27;s cup originated in the 1980s in a Boston Rosh Chodesh group; it was invented by Stephanie Loo, who filled it with mayim hayim (living waters) and used it in a feminist ceremony of guided meditation. Miriam&#x27;s cup is linked to the &quot;midrash&quot; of Miriam&#x27;s well, which &quot;is a rabbinic legend that tells of a miraculous well that accompanied the Israelites during their 40 years in the desert at the Exodus from Egypt&quot;. Furthermore, some Jews include an orange on the seder plate. The orange represents the fruitfulness for all Jews when all marginalized peoples are included, particularly women and gay people. An incorrect but common rumor says that this tradition began when a man told Susannah Heschel that a woman belongs on the bimah as an orange on the seder plate; however, it actually began when in the early 1980s, while when speaking at Oberlin College Hillel, Susannah Heschel was introduced to an early feminist Haggadah that suggested adding a crust of bread on the seder plate, as a sign of solidarity with Jewish lesbians (as some would say there&#x27;s as much room for a lesbian in Judaism as there is for a crust of bread on the seder plate). Heschel felt that to put bread on the seder plate would be to accept that Jewish lesbians and gay men violate Judaism like chametz violates Passover. So, at her next seder, she chose an orange as a symbol of inclusion of gays and lesbians and others who are marginalized within the Jewish community. In addition, each orange segment had a few seeds that had to be spit out – a gesture of spitting out and repudiating what they see as the homophobia of traditional Judaism.

Furthermore, many Haggadah now use gender-neutral English translations.

===Public Seders===
The group of people who hold a Passover Seder together is referred to in the Talmud (tractate Pesachim) as a &quot;chavurah&quot; (group). In the Far East, for example, Chabad-Lubavitch emissaries regularly conduct Seders for hundreds of visiting students, businesspeople and Jewish travelers. The Chabad Seder in Kathmandu regularly attracts more than 1,200 participants. In 2006, the Federation of Jewish Communities of the CIS and Baltic Countries organized over 500 public Seders throughout the Former Soviet Union, led by local rabbis and Chabad rabbinical students, drawing more than 150,000 attendees in total.

In Israel, where permanent residents observe only one Seder, overseas students learning in yeshivas and women&#x27;s seminaries are often invited in groups up to 100 for &quot;second-day Seders&quot; hosted by outreach organizations and private individuals.

===Christian Seders===

Some Christians, especially but not only Evangelical Protestants, have recently taken great interest in performing Seders according to . Many churches host Seders, usually adding a Messianic Christian Passover message, and many times inviting Messianic Jews to lead and teach on it. The Gospels place the Last Supper at Passover, so that some Christians have interpreted it as a Seder; in consequence some Christian Seders are on Maundy Thursday as part of commemorating the Last Supper. Many Christians cite the meal as a way to connect with the heritage of their own religion and to see how the practices of the ancient world are still relevant to Christianity today. However, the current form of the Passover Seder dates from the Rabbinic period, after Christianity and Judaism had already gone their separate ways. Some Jews and Christians consider Christian Seders an inappropriate cultural appropriation of Jewish ritual for non-Jewish purposes.

===Interfaith Seders===
A number of churches hold interfaith Seders where Jews and non-Jews alike are invited to share in the story and discuss common themes of peace, freedom, and religious tolerance. During the American civil rights movement of the 1960s, interfaith Seders energized and inspired leaders from various communities who came together to march for equal protection for all. The first of these, the &quot;Freedom Seder,&quot; was written by Arthur Waskow, published in &quot;Ramparts&quot; magazine and in a small booklet by the Micah Press and in a later edition (1970) by Holt-Rinehart-Winston, and was actually performed on April 4, 1969, the first anniversary of the death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the third night of Passover, at Lincoln Memorial Temple in Washington, DC. It celebrated the liberation struggle of Black America alongside that of ancient Israel from Pharaoh, and was the first Haggadah to go beyond the original Biblical story. It sparked a large number of Haggadahs celebrating various other forms of liberation – feminism, vegetarianism, the liberation movements in Latin America in the 1970s, ecological healing, etc.. Today, many Unitarian Universalist congregations hold annual interfaith community Seders. A number of Interfaith Passover Seder Haggadahs have been written especially for this purpose.

===White House Passover Seder===

In 2009 President Barack Obama began conducting an annual Passover seder in the Old Family Dining Room of the White House, marking the first time that a sitting US president hosted a Seder in the White House. The private dinner for about 20 guests, both Jewish and non-Jewish – including the President and his family, members of the President&#x27;s and First Lady&#x27;s staffs, and friends and their families – features the reading of the Haggadah, traditional rituals such as the hiding of the afikoman and the cup of Elijah, and the reading of the Emancipation Proclamation.

===Virtual Seders===

When people wish to participate in a shared Seder but are unable to be physically together, technology such as videoconferencing software can be used to facilitate a &quot;virtual&quot; Seder. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a surge of virtual Seders, as many Jews sought to practice social distancing during the holiday, or lived in jurisdictions where they were legally required to do so, and thus could not visit the homes of friends and family who were hosting Seders. The website OneTable saw a fourfold increase in the number of virtual seders it hosted from 2019 to 2020, and Zoom was widely used to host virtual Seders. Virtual seders were endorsed by Progressive rabbis but eschewed by Orthodox rabbis. The Rabbinical Assembly of Conservative Judaism issued guidance (though not an official Conservative responsum) specific to 2020 on using videoconferencing to facilitate Seders while avoiding or minimizing violations of Yom Tov restrictions that limit the use of electronic devices on holidays.

===Seder in space===
In 2022, the Israeli astronaut, Eytan Stibbe, participated in the first privately sponsored trip to the International Space Station as part of the &quot;Rakia&quot; mission to conduct science and technology experiments for a number of universities and startups in Israel. As part of the “Rakia” mission, Stibbe held the first Seder in space on the first night of the holiday. This included reciting kiddush, drinking grape juice, eating matzah, and relating to his fellow astronauts about the values that the Seder tradition and the reading of the Haggadah can teach, noting that the story of the exodus from Egypt of the people of Israel &quot;from slavery into freedom&quot; shows that &quot;no dream is beyond reach&quot;.

<text>Nisan (or Nissan; from ) in the Babylonian and Hebrew calendars is the month of the barley ripening and first month of spring. The name of the month is an Akkadian language borrowing, although it ultimately originates in Sumerian &quot;nisag&quot; &quot;first fruits&quot;. In the Hebrew calendar it is the first month of the ecclesiastical year, called the &quot;first of the months of the year&quot; (Exodus 12:1-2), &quot;first month&quot; (Ex 12:14), and the month of &quot;Aviv&quot; (Ex 13:4) &quot;ḥōḏeš hāʾāḇîḇ&quot;). It is called Nissān in the Book of Esther. It is a month of 30 days. In the year 2025, 1 Nisan will occur on 30 March. Counting from 1 Tishrei, the civil new year, it would be the seventh month (eighth, in leap year), but in contemporary Jewish culture, both months are viewed as the first and seventh simultaneously, and are referred to as one or the other depending on the specific religious aspects being discussed.

==Name and origin==
The biblical Hebrew months were given enumerations instead of names. The new moon of Aviv, which in Hebrew means &quot;barley ripening&quot; and by extension &quot;spring season&quot;(Exodus 9:31) is one of the few called both by name and by its number, the first. Nisan and other Akkadian-origin names for the equivalent lunar months in the Babylonian calendar came to be applied to the Hebrew calendar during the Babylonian captivity, in which the month of Aviv&#x27;s name was &quot;Araḫ Nissānu&quot;, the &quot;month of beginning&quot;.

==Holidays and observances==
* 1 Nisan Lunar new year, marking the month of Aviv meaning spring, as the first month of the year, which month was later called Nisan. The first national mitzvah that was given to the Jewish people to fix the calendar to the new moon of Aviv, according to the Book of Exodus 12:1–2, 12:18. ( BCE)
* 10 Nisan – Yom HaAliyah – Aliyah Day, Israeli national holiday

* 15–21 Nisan (22 Nisan outside of Israel) – Feast of Matzot - Passover week 
* 23 Nisan – Mimouna – a Maghrebi Jewish celebration of the end of the Passover prohibition on eating &quot;chametz&quot;, on 22 Nisan within Israel
* 27 Nisan – Yom HaShoah (Holocaust and Heroism Remembrance Day) – on 26 Nisan or 28 Nisan when the 27th falls on Friday or Sunday respectively, interfering with Shabbat

==Moveable holidays and observances==
* Shabbat HaGadol is the sabbath which immediately precedes the 15 Nisan, the first day of Pesach, which changes due to the leap year in the Hebrew calendar.

==Table of civil dates when 1 Nisan occurs==

The list below gives a time which can be used to determine the day the Jewish ecclesiastical (spring) year starts over a period of nineteen years. These are not Nisan &quot;molad&quot; times, although the offset necessarily remains constant. (The fractions shown are fractions of a minute.)

Every nineteen years this time is 2 days, 16 hours, 33 1/18 minutes later in the week. That is either the same or the previous day in the civil calendar, depending on whether the difference in the day of the week is three or two days. If 29 February is included fewer than five times in the nineteen – year period the date will be later by the number of days which corresponds to the difference between the actual number of insertions and five. If the year is due to start on Sunday, it actually begins on the following Tuesday if the following year is due to start on Friday morning. If due to start on Monday, Wednesday or Friday it actually begins on the following day. If due to start on Saturday, it actually begins on the following day if the previous year was due to begin on Monday morning.

The table below lists, for a Jewish year commencing on 23 March, the civil date of the first day of each month. If the year does not begin on 23 March, each month&#x27;s first day will differ from the date shown by the number of days that the start of the year differs from 23 March. The correct column is the one which shows the correct starting date for the following year in the last row. If 29 February falls within a Jewish month the first day of later months will be a day earlier than shown.

For long period calculations, dates should be reduced to the Julian calendar and converted back to the civil calendar at the end of the calculation. The civil calendar used here (Exigian) is correct to one day in 44,000 years and omits the leap day in centennial years which do not give remainder 200 or 700 when divided by 900. It is identical to the Gregorian calendar between 15 October 1582 CE and 28 February 2400 CE (both dates inclusive). 

To find how many days the civil calendar is ahead of the Julian in any year from 301 BCE (the calendar is proleptic [assumed] up to 1582 CE) add 300 to the year, multiply the hundreds by 7, divide by 9 and subtract 4. Ignore any fraction of a day. When the difference between the calendars changes the calculated value applies on and from 1 March (civil date) for conversions to Julian. For earlier dates reduce the calculated value by one. For conversions to the civil date the calculated value applies on and from 29 February (Julian date). Again, for earlier dates reduce the calculated value by one. The difference is applied to the calendar one is converting into. A negative value indicates that the Julian date is ahead of the civil date. In this case it is important to remember that when calculating the civil equivalent of 29 February (Julian), 29 February is discounted. Thus if the calculated value is −4 the civil equivalent of this date is 24 February. Before 1 CE use astronomical years rather than years BCE. The astronomical year is (year BCE) – 1.

Up to the 4th century CE, these tables give the day of the Jewish month to within a day or so and the number of the month to within a month or so. From the 4th century, the number of the month is given exactly and from the 9th century the day of the month is given exactly as well.

In the Julian calendar, every 76 years the Jewish year is due to start 5h 47 14/18m earlier, and 3d 18h 12 4/18m later in the week.

;Example calculation

On what civil date does the eighth month begin in CE 20874–5?

20874=2026+(248x76). In (248x76) Julian years the Jewish year is due to start (248x3d 18h 12 4/18m) later in the week, which is 932d 2h 31 2/18m or 1d 2h 31 2/18m later after removing complete weeks. Allowing for the current difference of thirteen days between the civil and Julian calendars, the Julian date is 13+(248x0d 5h 47 4/18m) earlier, which is 72d 21h 28 16/18m earlier. Convert back to the civil calendar by applying the formula.

:20874+300=21174
:211x7=1477
:1477/9=164 remainder 1
:164-4=160.
:160d-72d 21h 28 16/18m=87d 2h 31 2/18m.

So, in 20874 CE, the Jewish year is due to begin 87d 2h 31 2/18m later than in 2026 CE and 1d 2h 31 2/18m later in the week. In 20874 CE, therefore, the Jewish year is due to begin at 11.30 3/18 A.M. on Friday, 14 June. Because of the displacements, it actually begins on Saturday, 15 June. Odd months have 30 days and even months 29, so the starting dates are 2, 15 July; 3, 13 August; 4, 12 September; 5, 11 October; 6, 10 November; 7, 9 December, and 8, 8 January.

The rules are based on the theory that Maimonides explains in his book &quot;Rabbinical Astronomy&quot;. The times in the list are those calculated by Gauss with an offset of -14 days as his calculation gives the civil date of Passover rather than the start of the month.

<doc id="46406" wikidata="Q364350" url="?curid=46406" title="Hubert van Eyck">
<text>Hubert van Eyck (; – 18 September 1426) was an Early Netherlandish painter and older brother of Jan van Eyck, as well as Lambert and Margareta, also painters. The absence of any single work that he can clearly be said to have completed continues to make an assessment of his achievement highly uncertain, although for centuries he had the reputation of being an outstanding founding artist of Early Netherlandish painting.

==Life and career==
He was probably born in Maaseik, in what is now the Belgian province of Limburg, into a family in the gentry.

As the name was not a very common one, he is probably the &quot;Magister Hubertus, Pictor&quot; recorded as having been paid in 1409 for panels in the church of Onze Lieve Vrouwe, Tongeren. He is probably also Master Hubert who had painted a panel bequeathed in 1413 by Jan de Visch van der Capelle to his daughter, a Benedictine nun near Grevelingen; however he does not appear in guild records, and his heirs did not include any children, so it has been suggested that he may have been in minor orders, perhaps attached to what was then the abbey, now the cathedral, of St Bavo at Ghent, where his &quot;Ghent Altarpiece&quot; still remains, settling in Ghent by .

Around the time of his settlement, or shortly afterward, he began his only surviving documented work, the &quot;Ghent Altarpiece&quot; in St Bavo&#x27;s. However, the painting was not finished until six years after his death, in 1432, so the degree to which the surviving altarpiece reflects his work, rather than that of Jan who took it over, remains much discussed. An inscription on the frame, which was destroyed in the &quot;beeldenstorm&quot; in 1566, stated that Hubert van Eyck &quot;maior quo Nemo reports&quot; (greater than anyone) started the altarpiece, but that Jan van Eyck – calling himself &quot;arte Secundus&quot; (second-best in the art) – completed it in 1432.

Writing in 1933, art historian Bryson Burroughs, who at that time attributed to Hubert the &quot;Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych&quot;, describing him as &quot;the fountainhead of northern painting&quot;, suggests he did the underdrawing for the &quot;Ghent Altarpiece&quot; with Jan painting in after his brother&#x27;s death; some form of this view remains common among specialists. Modern scientific investigation reveals various changes between the finished work and the lower painted levels and the underdrawing. Today the inscription is often regarded as an overgenerous fraternal tribute. Given the circumstances, the Ghent Altarpiece is a difficult work to use for comparison when assessing other attributions, especially as several other artists from the brothers&#x27; workshops probably worked on it as well.

The town magistrates of Ghent visited his workshop in 1425; the city had commissioned two designs for a painting from him. He died on or before 18 September 1426, probably still in his thirties, and was buried in Saint Bavo&#x27;s Cathedral, next to his sister Margareta according to the 16th-century writer van Vaernewijck, who says she was also a painter and unmarried. His heirs paid taxes relating to properties in Ghent. A copper inscription recording his date of death was engraved on the tombstone, but is now missing. According to a tradition from the 16th century, his arm was preserved as a relic in a casket above the portal of Saint Bavo of Ghent. Van Vaernewijck also records the local tradition that Jan van Eyck was trained by his brother, though when Jan is first documented in August 1422 he was already a &quot;master&quot; and working in The Hague.

==Legacy==
The division of surviving works between Hubert, early Jan van Eyck, and other painters has been the subject of great debate among art historians, involving the &quot;Ghent Altarpiece&quot;, the many different hands that can be detected in the Turin-Milan Hours, and other pieces. In the 19th and early 20th centuries the inscription on the &quot;Ghent Altarpiece&quot; was usually taken at face value, and most unsigned works now given to the early years of his brother Jan were attributed to Hubert. After a period in the mid-20th century when there was a strong tendency to attribute work away from Hubert, he has made something of a comeback in recent decades, but there is still a wide range of opinion among specialists. He is likely to have begun The Three Marys at the Tomb now in the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam, but this seems to have been finished by another artist some decades later and has suffered from the restoration. Drawings in the Albertina, Vienna of the Apostles have been attributed to him and the British Museum has a drawing copying a lost &quot;Capture of Christ&quot; that relates to parts of the &quot;Ghent Altarpiece&quot;.

<doc id="46407" wikidata="Q932711" url="?curid=46407" title="Shemini Atzeret">
<text>Shemini Atzeret (—&quot;Eighth [day] of Assembly&quot;) is a Jewish holiday. It is celebrated on the 22nd day of the Hebrew month of Tishrei, usually coinciding with late September or early October. It directly follows the festival of Sukkot, which is celebrated for &quot;seven&quot; days; thus, Shemini Atzeret is literally the &quot;eighth&quot; day [of assembly]. It is a separate—yet connected—holy day devoted to the spiritual aspects of the festival of Sukkot. Part of its duality as a holy day is that it is simultaneously considered to be connected to Sukkot and a separate festival in its own right.

Outside the Land of Israel, this is further complicated by the additional day added to all Biblical holidays except Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Shemini Atzeret is thus sometimes wrongly regarded as the eighth day of Sukkot outside the Land of Israel, leading to sometimes involved analysis as to which practices of each holiday are to apply.

The celebration of Simchat Torah is the most distinctive feature of the holiday, but it is a later rabbinical innovation. In the Land of Israel, the celebrations of Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah are combined on a single day, and the names are used interchangeably. In the Diaspora, the celebration of Simchat Torah is deferred to the second day of the holiday. Commonly, only the first day is referred to as &quot;Shemini Atzeret&quot;, while the second is called &quot;Simchat Torah&quot;.

Karaite Jews and Samaritans also observe Shemini Atzeret, as they do all Biblical holidays. However, due to differences in calendar calculations, it may occur on a different day from the conventional Jewish celebration. Karaites and Samaritans do not include the rabbinical innovation of Simchat Torah in their observance of the day and do not observe a second day—of any holiday—in the Diaspora.

==Biblical origins==
According to &quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;, &quot;atzeret&quot; () is the name given to this day in four different locations in the Hebrew Bible. It is not mentioned in Deuteronomy 16, and is found only in those parts of the Bible known as the Priestly Code. Like &quot;atzarah,&quot; &quot;atzeret&quot; denotes &quot;day of assembly&quot;, from &quot;atzar&quot; (&quot;to hold back&quot; or &quot;keep in&quot;); hence the name &quot;atzeret&quot; given to the seventh day of Pesaḥ. Owing, however, to the fact that both Shemini Atzeret and the seventh day of Pesaḥ are described as &quot;atzeret&quot;, the name was taken to mean &quot;the closing festival&quot;.

==Significance==

===&quot;Shemini:&quot; &quot;Eighth Day&quot; of Sukkot===
When Shemini Atzeret is mentioned in the Torah (known in Greek as the &quot;Pentateuch&quot;), it is always mentioned in the context of the seven-day festival of Sukkot: the holiday Shemini Atzeret immediately follows. For example, Sukkot is described in detail in Leviticus 23:33–43. Shemini Atzeret is mentioned in only verses 36 and 39.

The Hebrew word &quot;shemini&quot; means &quot;eighth&quot;. This refers to the date of Shemini Atzeret relative to Sukkot; it falls on the latter’s eighth day. It is often assumed that Shemini Atzeret is simply the eighth day of Sukkot. That characterization, however, is only partly accurate.

The celebration of Sukkot is characterized by the use of the &quot;sukkah&quot; (booth or tabernacle) and the Four Species (tree branches and fruit used in the celebration). However, the Torah specifies using those objects for only seven days, not eight. The observance of Shemini Atzeret, therefore, differs in substantial ways from that of Sukkot. The Talmud describes Shemini Atzeret with the words &quot;a holiday in its own right&quot; (&quot;regel bifnei atzmo&quot;).

The Talmud describes six ways in which Shemini Atzeret differs from Sukkot. Four of these relate principally to the Temple service, but two others remain relevant to the modern celebration of the holiday. First, the blessing known as &quot;Shehecheyanu&quot; is recited on the night of Shemini Atzeret just as it is on the first night of all other major Jewish holidays. Second, the holiday is referred to distinctively as &quot;Shemini Atzeret&quot; and not as &quot;Sukkot&quot; in the prayer service.

Immediately following that discussion, however, the Talmud describes Shemini Atzeret as the &quot;end holiday of the festival [of Sukkot]&quot;. The context here is that the Sukkot obligations of joy and recitation of Hallel (Psalms 113–118) last eight days. This is also why one of Sukkot&#x27;s liturgical aliases, &quot;Time of Our Happiness&quot; (&quot;zman simḥatenu&quot;), continues to be used to describe Shemini Atzeret—and, by extension, Simchat Torah—in the liturgy.

Shemini Atzeret is, in conclusion, simultaneously &quot;a holiday in its own right&quot; and the &quot;end holiday of [Sukkot]&quot;.

===&quot;Atzeret:&quot; A day for assembly—or pause===
Spiritually, Shemini Atzeret can also be seen to &quot;guard the seven days of Sukkot&quot;. The Hebrew word &quot;atzeret&quot; is generally translated as &quot;assembly&quot;, but shares a linguistic root with the word &quot;atzor&quot;, meaning &quot;stop&quot; or &quot;tarry&quot;. Shemini Atzeret is characterized as a day when the Jewish People &quot;tarries&quot; to spend an additional day with God at the end of Sukkot. Rashi cites the parable of a king who invites his sons to dine with him for a number of days, but when the time comes for them to leave, he asks them to stay for another day, since it is difficult for him to part from them. According to this idea, Sukkot is a universal holiday, but Shemini Atzeret is for only the Jewish People. Moreover, Shemini Atzeret is a modest holiday intended to honor [God&#x27;s] special relationship with his beloved nation.

A different but related interpretation is offered by Yaakov Tzvi Mecklenburg, who translates &quot;atzeret&quot; as &quot;retain&quot;: &quot;During the holiday season, we have experienced a heightened religious fervor and a most devout spirit. This last day is devoted to a recapitulation of the message of these days, with the hope that it will be retained the rest of the year&quot;.

===Connections to the prior Jewish holy days===

The day before Shemini Atzeret is the last day of Sukkot. It is called Hoshana Rabbah and is unique and different from the other days of Sukkot. While it is part of the “intermediate” days of Sukkot known as &quot;Chol HaMoed&quot;, Hoshana Rabbah has extra prayers and rituals and is treated and practised much more seriously and festively than are the previous days of &quot;Chol HaMoed&quot;. In particular, during the morning prayer service of Hoshana Rabbah, there are seven &quot;hoshanot&quot; with their own seven &quot;hakafot&quot; or &quot;seven processions&quot;. That sets the stage for the ritual, mood, tenor, and heightened sense of festivity for the days that follow it—namely, of Shemini Atzeret when seven &quot;hakafot&quot; are again performed.{{refn|group=note|The &quot;hakafot&quot; of Shemini Atzeret are the same as those used in the Simchat Torah celebration, which is observed in Israel in tandem with Shemini Atzeret. Outside the Land of Israel, the &quot;hakafot&quot; are performed by some congregations on the evening preceding Shemini Atzeret, and then by all on both the night and during the day of Simchat Torah.

&quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; states that during the time of the Second Temple, the festival of Shavuot received the specific name of &quot;&#x27;Atzarta&quot; as cited by Josephus in Antiquities of the Jews (iii. 10, § 6) and in the Talmud&#x27;s tractate Pesahim (42b, 68b), signifying &quot;the closing feast&quot; of Passover. Commenting on this, the Rabbis in Tractate Pesahim say that:

The closing feast of Sukkot (i.e., Shemini Atzeret) ought rightly to have been, like that of Passover (i.e., Shavuot) on the fiftieth day, but, in order not to force the people to make another journey to Jerusalem in the rainy season, God fixed it as early as the eighth day.

Shemini Atzeret thus concludes the process of judgment, repentance, and atonement begun on Rosh Hashanah: the Jewish New Year. Four days after the conclusion of Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, Sukkot begins and is regarded as the celebration of the anticipated Divine &quot;good judgment&quot; that was, religious Jews hope, granted while observing the High Holy Days. (Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and the week between them are known as the Ten Days of Repentance.) Hoshana Rabbah, Shemini Atzeret, and Simchat Torah then culminate the process with open celebration and festivity with joyous prayers, festive meals, and dancing, with the Torah scrolls held as the center of attention during the &quot;hakafot&quot; in the synagogue.

==Evolution of observances and customs==

The Torah explicitly mentions Shemini Atzeret three times, all in the context of Sukkot. Only two observances are specified for Shemini Atzeret. One relates to the Temple service, and is not relevant to modern observance. The other is the avoidance of &quot;servile labor&quot; &quot;(melechet avodah),&quot; as on other major Jewish holidays.{{sfn|Ribiat|1999}} &quot;(See also Jewish holidays — &quot;Work&quot; on Sabbath and biblical holidays.)&quot; No other specific rituals or ritual objects are specified, making Shemini Atzeret unique in that regard among the festivals mentioned in the Torah.

Two observances of Shemini Atzeret are mentioned in the Prophets and Writings portions of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible). The first occurred at the time of the dedication of the First Temple by Solomon. The second came at the time of the Jews&#x27; return from the Babylonian exile. In both cases, however, the mention is limited to the observation that an &quot;assembly &quot;[atzeret]&quot; was held on the eighth day&quot;.

According to the Apocryphal Second Book of Maccabees, the first celebration of Hanukkah mimicked that of Sukkot, which the Maccabees and their followers had been unable to celebrate earlier that year. However, the only allusion to Shemini Atzeret in that narrative is that the Hanukkah celebration was fixed for eight days—in remembrance of both the seven days of Sukkot and the additional day of Shemini Atzeret.


Like most Jewish holidays of Biblical origin, Shemini Atzeret is observed for one day within the Land of Israel, and traditionally for two days outside Israel. Reform and Reconstructionist communities generally celebrate this and most Biblical holidays for one day, even outside Israel. The second day observed outside Israel is called &quot;Simchat Torah&quot; (see next section).

===Simchat Torah===
{{Main|Simchat Torah}}
The practice of reading the Ve-zot ha-berakhah, the last of the weekly Torah portions on Shemini Atzeret is documented in the Talmud. That Talmudic source does not refer to the occasion as &quot;Simchat Torah&quot;, but simply as [the second day of] Shemini Atzeret, and it is also not clear from that source if it is read as the last Torah portion (as is our custom) or as a special Festival reading.

The Simchat Torah celebration of today is of later rabbinic and customary origin. The day (but not the name) is mentioned in the &quot;siddur&quot; of Rav Amram Gaon (9th century CE); the assignment of the first chapter of Joshua as the &quot;haftarah&quot; of the day is mentioned there. The reading of the first section of Genesis immediately upon the conclusion of the last section of Deuteronomy—as well as the name &quot;Simchat Torah&quot;—can be found in the 14th century &quot;halachic&quot; work &quot;Arba&#x27;ah Turim.&quot; By the 16th century CE, most of the features of the modern celebration of Simchat Torah were in place in some form. The Simchat Torah celebration is now the most distinctive feature of this festival—so much so that in the Land of Israel, where Shemini Atzeret lasts only one day, it is more common to refer to the day as &quot;Simchat Torah&quot; than as &quot;Shemini Atzeret&quot;.

In the 20th century, Simchat Torah came to symbolize the public assertion of Jewish identity. The Jews of the Soviet Union, in particular, would celebrate the festival &quot;en masse&quot; in the streets of Moscow. On October 14, 1973, more than 100,000 Jews took part in a post-Simchat Torah rally in New York city on behalf of refuseniks and Soviet Jewry. Dancing in the street with the Torah has become part of the holiday&#x27;s ritual in various Jewish congregations in the United States as well. In Israel, many communities conduct &quot;Hakafot shniyot,&quot; or &quot;Second &quot;hakafot&quot;,&quot; on the day after Shemini Atzeret. In part, this shows solidarity with Jewish communities outside Israel, which are still celebrating Simchat Torah (on the second day of the festival). At the same time, it allows for a Simchat Torah celebration unconstrained by festival work restrictions, since the festival is over in Israel according to Jewish law.

Outside Israel, where Shemini Atzeret is observed for two days,{{sfn|Hoffman|2011|p=41}} Simchat Torah is deferred to the second day, when all agree there is no obligation of &quot;sukkah&quot;.

===Carryover of Sukkot observances outside the Land of Israel===
{{main|Sukkot}}
In Israel—and for different reasons in Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism—none of the unique observances of Sukkot (&quot;sukkah&quot;, &quot;lulav&quot; and &quot;etrog&quot;) carry over to Shemini Atzeret. 
Shemini Atzeret is a holiday in its own right, without &quot;sukkah&quot;, &quot;lulav&quot; and &quot;etrog&quot;. At the same time, by the rabbinic decree to add one day to all holidays outside the Land of Israel, both Passover and Sukkot, although described in the Torah as seven-day holidays, are observed outside the Land of Israel for eight days. Accordingly, the &quot;eighth day of Sukkot&quot; outside Israel coincides with the separate holiday of Shemini Atzeret.

Psalm 27, which is recited in most communities twice daily starting at the beginning of Elul, continues to be recited on Shemini Atzeret outside the Land of Israel.{{sfn|Sacks|2009}} When Shemini Atzeret falls on the Shabbat, the Scroll of Ecclesiastes, or Kohelet ({{lang|he|קהלת}}, otherwise read in Ashkenazi synagogues on the Shabbat of Sukkot), is read on that day outside the Land of Israel. In the Land of Israel, it would have been read on the first day of Sukkot, which would also have been on Shabbat. The Torah reading (Deuteronomy 14:22–16:17) is the same as on the Final Day of Passover and Second Day of Shavuot. However, in the Eastern Ashkenazic rite, unlike Passover and Shavuot, the longer version of the Torah reading is included on Shemini Atzeret even when the day does not fall on the Shabbat because the reading refers to separation of agricultural gifts (like tithes and &quot;terumah&quot;), which are due at this time of the year; in the Western Ashkenazic rite, as well as in most Sephardic communities, the short reading is read on Shemini Atzeret when it falls on a weekday. The Haftarah describes the people&#x27;s blessing of King Solomon at the end of the dedication of the First Temple.{{sfn|Cogan|Weiss|2002|p=162}}

====Taking the&quot; lulav&quot; and &quot;etrog&quot; and sleeping in the &quot;sukkah&quot;====
The prevalent practice is that one eats in the &quot;sukkah&quot; on the eighth day, but without reciting the blessing (&quot;berakhah&quot;) for sitting in a &quot;sukkah&quot;. However, one does not take the &quot;lulav&quot; and &quot;etrog&quot; (nor does one sleep in the &quot;sukkah&quot; according to most opinions) on the eighth day. If someone sees a neighbor on the street with a &quot;lulav&quot; and &quot;etrog&quot; on the eighth day, the rabbis reason, they might mistakenly assume that it is still the seventh day (&quot;ḥol hamoed&quot;), when the &quot;lulav&quot; and &quot;etrog&quot; are still needed. They might then violate prohibitions of the &quot;yom tov&quot; of the eighth day. For that reason, the rabbis ruled that one should not take the &quot;lulav&quot; and &quot;etrog&quot; on the eighth day, even outside the Land of Israel. They are therefore &quot;muktzah&quot;; that is, one may not even move them on a holiday where they are not needed. Sleeping in the &quot;sukkah&quot; brings a similar discussion. Additionally, most people would prefer to sleep indoors at this point in the year due to the weather, so sleeping in the &quot;sukkah&quot; may impinge on one&#x27;s own joy during the festival. This is why many rabbis ruled that one does not sleep in the &quot;sukkah&quot; on Shemini Atzeret, even outside the Land of Israel. Other rabbis, such as the Vilna Gaon, ruled that one should sleep in the &quot;sukkah&quot; on Shemini Atzeret outside the Land of Israel.

====Eating in the &quot;sukkah&quot;====
Eating in the &quot;sukkah&quot; does not cause a parallel problem because many people simply enjoy eating outdoors in the shade of a &quot;sukkah&quot;. Hence, seeing someone eating in a &quot;sukkah&quot; does not &quot;per se&quot; lead one to assume it is still &quot;ḥol hamoed&quot;. Likewise, eating in the &quot;sukkah&quot; does not &quot;per se&quot; impinge on one&#x27;s own celebration of Shemini Atzeret. Therefore, the prevalent practice is to eat in the &quot;sukkah&quot; on Shemini Azeret outside the Land of Israel, but not to recite the &quot;berakhah&quot; for sitting in a &quot;sukkah&quot;, as reciting it would &quot;impinge&quot; on the unique status of Shemini Atzeret.

There are, however, those who have different &quot;minhagim&quot; (customs). Many Hasidic groups have a tradition to recite the morning &quot;kiddush&quot; and then have refreshments (such as cake) in the &quot;sukkah&quot;, but to eat both the evening and morning main meals inside, notwithstanding the Talmudic ruling to the contrary. Others eat the evening meal of Shemini Atzeret indoors but the day meal in the &quot;sukkah&quot;. Each of these approaches addresses aspects of the dual nature of Shemini Atzeret.

===Other customs===
The Land of Israel&#x27;s agriculture depends heavily on rains that come only seasonally, so Jewish prayers for rain, such as &quot;Tefillat Geshem&quot; or &quot;Tikun Geshem&quot; (Rain Prayer) are prominent during the Land of Israel&#x27;s rainy (winter) half of the year.{{sfn|Nulman|1996|p=322}} The rainy season starts just after the fall Jewish holidays. Because of that, and because the &quot;sukkah&quot; (and, by extension, pleasant weather) is no longer required on Shemini Atzeret, Jews begin to praise God for making rain starting with the Musaf &quot;amidah&quot; prayer of Shemini Atzeret.{{sfn|Eisenberg|2010|pp=239–40}} In the Ashkenazic tradition, this prayer is recited in a traditional, distinctive, plaintive melody during the cantor&#x27;s repetition of the &quot;amidah&quot;; according to the original custom, there are also many silent piyyutim, which today are omitted in most communities but still maintained in some communities. In some Ashkenazi synagogues, the cantor is clad in a white &quot;kittel,&quot; a symbol of piety, owing to the vitality of a positive judgment for rain. A brief mention of rain continues to be inserted in the &quot;amidah&quot; until Passover. The Yizkor memorial service is also recited in the Eastern Ashkenazic rite on this day, and it was adopted in some Western Ashkenazic communities.{{Sfn|Kunin|2000|p=267}}
Recital of the Yizkor prayer is said to bring the person &quot;closer to the cold and brittle part of mourning&quot;, and is necessary to promote the healing of a broken heart.{{sfn|Brener|2001|p=222}}

==Observance in non-rabbinical Jewish traditions==
As a biblically-mentioned holiday, Shemini Atzeret is also observed by Karaites and Samaritans:

===In Karaite Judaism===
For Karaites, followers of a branch of Judaism that accepts the Written Law, but not the Oral Law, Shemini Atzeret is observed as a single day of rest, not associated with the practices of &quot;Simchat Torah,&quot; which are a rabbinic innovation. Nevertheless, the Karaite cycle of weekly Torah reading, like the Rabbinic cycle, reaches its conclusion on Shemini Atzeret. Accordingly, in at least some Karaite circles, this day is referred to by the name of &quot;Simchat Torah.&quot; 
Additionally, calculation of the Karaite calendar is not based on astronomical calculations, but only on direct observation of the New Moon and the ripening of barley. Because of that, the 22nd day of the 7th month does not necessarily fall on the same date as 22 Tishrei in the (conventional, Rabbinic) Jewish calendar. In 2015, Shemini Atzeret fell on October 7 for Karaites, two days later than in the conventional Jewish calendar. In 2016, Shemini Atzeret fell on the same day according to both calendars.

===In the Samaritan tradition===
Samaritans, i.e. the northern Israelites who split from Jews during the reign of King Rehoboam, recognise only the first five (or six) books of the Bible as canonical, and thus celebrate only one day of Shemini Aṣereth. 

Shortly after midnight, prayers are made in the synagogue for more than ten hours. No work is permitted on this day. At the end of the holiday, the succahs are dismantled. Their poles and nets will be stored until the next Harvest Festival. The fruits will be squeezed into sweetened juice and some will be eaten by the children.

== 2023 Hamas-led attack ==
{{main |2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel}}
On October 07, 2023, 06:29, on the morning of Shemini Atzeret, Hamas launched an attack on Israeli army installations and civilian communities near the Gaza border. Around 1,140 Israelis were killed and over 250 were kidnapped and taken to Gaza as hostages, most of them unarmed civilians. This event marked the starting point of the Israel–Hamas war.

<text>Magenta () is a purplish-red color. On color wheels of the RGB (additive) and CMY (subtractive) color models, it is located precisely midway between blue and red. It is one of the four colors of ink used in color printing by an inkjet printer, along with yellow, cyan, and black to make all the other colors. The tone of magenta used in printing, printer&#x27;s magenta, is redder than the magenta of the RGB (additive) model, the former being closer to rose.

Magenta took its name from an aniline dye made and patented in 1859 by the French chemist François-Emmanuel Verguin, who originally called it &quot;fuchsine&quot;. 
It was renamed to celebrate the French-Sardinian victory under French Emperor Napoleon III at the Battle of Magenta against the larger army of the Austrian Empire on 4 June 1859 near the Italian town of Magenta, at the time in Austria. This battle was decisive in liberating Italy from Austrian domination. 

A virtually identical color, called roseine, was created in 1860 by two British chemists, Edward Chambers Nicholson, and George Maule.

The web color magenta is also called fuchsia.

==In optics and color science==
Magenta is an extra-spectral color, meaning that it is not a hue associated with monochromatic visible light. Magenta is associated with perception of spectral power distributions concentrated mostly in two bands: longer wavelength reddish components and shorter wavelength blueish components.

In the RGB color system, used to create all the colors on a television or computer display, magenta is a secondary color, made by combining equal amounts of red and blue light at a high intensity. In this system, magenta is the complementary color of green, and combining green and magenta light on a black screen will create white.
In the CMYK color model, used in color printing, it is one of the three primary colors, along with cyan and yellow, used to print all the rest of the colors. If magenta, cyan, and yellow are printed on top of each other on a page, they make black. In this model, magenta is the complementary color of green. If combined, green and magenta ink will look dark brown or black. The magenta used in color printing, sometimes called process magenta, is a darker shade than the color used on computer screens.

In terms of physiology, the color is stimulated in the brain when the eye reports input from short wave blue cone cells along with a sub-sensitivity of the long wave cones which respond secondarily to that same deep blue color, but with little or no input from the middle wave cones. The brain interprets that combination as some hue of magenta or purple, depending on the relative strengths of the cone responses.

In the Munsell color system, magenta is called &quot;red-purple&quot;.

If the spectrum is wrapped to form a color wheel, magenta (additive secondary) appears midway between red and violet. Violet and red, the two components of magenta, are at opposite ends of the visible spectrum and have very different wavelengths. The additive secondary color magenta is made by combining violet and red light at equal intensity; it is not present in the spectrum itself.

==Fuchsia and magenta==
The web colors fuchsia and magenta are identical, made by mixing the same proportions of blue and red light. In design and printing, there is more variation. The French version of fuchsia in the RGB color model and in printing contains a higher proportion of red than the American version of fuchsia.

==History==

===Fuchsine and magenta dye (1859)===

The color magenta was the result of the industrial chemistry revolution of the mid-nineteenth century, which began with the invention by William Perkin of mauveine in 1856, which was the first synthetic aniline dye. The enormous commercial success of the dye and the new color it produced, mauve, inspired other chemists in Europe to develop new colors made from aniline dyes.

In France, François-Emmanuel Verguin, the director of the chemical factory of Louis Rafard near Lyon, tried many different formulae before finally in late 1858 or early 1859, mixing aniline with carbon tetrachloride, producing a reddish-purple dye which he called &quot;fuchsine&quot;, after the color of the flower of the fuchsia plant. He quit the Rafard factory and took his color to a firm of paint manufacturers, Francisque and Joseph Renard, who began to manufacture the dye in 1859.

In the same year, two British chemists, Edward Chambers Nicholson and George Maule, working at the laboratory of the paint manufacturer George Simpson, located in Walworth, south of London, made another aniline dye with a similar red-purple color, which they began to manufacture in 1860 under the name &quot;roseine&quot;. In 1860, they changed the name of the color to &quot;magenta&quot;, in honor of the Battle of Magenta fought by the armies of France and Sardinia against Austrians at Magenta, Lombardy the year before, and the new color became a commercial success.

Starting in 1935, the family of quinacridone dyes was developed. These have colors ranging from red to violet, so nowadays a quinacridone dye is often used for magenta. Various tones of magenta—light, bright, brilliant, vivid, rich, or deep—may be formulated by adding varying amounts of white to quinacridone artist&#x27;s paints.

Another dye used for magenta is Lithol Rubine BK. One of its uses is as a food coloring.

===Process magenta (pigment magenta; printer&#x27;s magenta) (1890s)===

In color printing, the color called process magenta, pigment magenta, or printer&#x27;s magenta is one of the three primary pigment colors which, along with yellow and cyan, constitute the three subtractive primary colors of pigment. (The secondary colors of pigment are blue, green, and red.) As such, the hue magenta is the complement of green: magenta pigments absorb green light; thus magenta and green are opposite colors.

The CMYK printing process was invented in the 1890s, when newspapers began to publish color comic strips.

Process magenta is not an RGB color, and there is no fixed conversion from CMYK primaries to RGB. Different formulations are used for printer&#x27;s ink, so there may be variations in the printed color that is pure magenta ink.
===Web colors magenta and fuchsia===

The web color magenta is one of the three secondary colors in the RGB color model.
On the RGB color wheel, magenta is the color between rose and violet, and halfway between red and blue.

This color is called &quot;magenta&quot; in X11 and &quot;fuchsia&quot; in HTML. In the RGB color model, it is created by combining equal intensities of red and blue light. The two web colors magenta and fuchsia are exactly the same color. Sometimes the web color magenta is called &quot;electric magenta&quot; or &quot;electronic magenta&quot;.

While the magenta used in printing and the web color have the same name, they have important differences. Process magenta (the color used for magenta printing ink—also called printer&#x27;s or pigment magenta) is much less vivid than the color magenta achievable on a computer screen. CMYK printing technology cannot accurately reproduce on paper the color on the computer screen. When the web color magenta is reproduced on paper, it is called fuchsia and it is physically impossible for it to appear on paper as vivid as on a computer screen.

Colored pencils and crayons called &quot;magenta&quot; are usually colored the color of &quot;process magenta&quot; (&quot;printer&#x27;s magenta&quot;).

==In science and culture==

===In art===
* Paul Gauguin (1848–1903) used a shade of magenta in 1890 in his portrait of Marie Lagadu, and in some of his South Seas paintings.
* Henri Matisse and the members of the Fauvist movement used magenta and other non-traditional colors to surprise viewers, and to move their emotions through the use of bold colors.
* Since the mid-1960s, water based fluorescent magenta paint has been available to paint psychedelic black light paintings. (Fluorescent cerise, fluorescent chartreuse yellow, fluorescent blue, and fluorescent green.)
===In literature===
* The color plays a central role in Craig Laurance Gidney&#x27;s novel &quot;A Spectral Hue&quot;.

===In film===
* The titular alien entity in the 2019 horror film &quot;Color Out of Space&quot;, an adaptation of the 1927 H. P. Lovecraft short story &quot;The Colour Out of Space&quot;, is depicted as being magenta due to the color&#x27;s extra-spectral status.

===In astronomy===
* Astronomers have reported that spectral class T brown dwarfs (the ones with the coolest temperatures except for the recently discovered Y brown dwarfs) are colored magenta because of absorption by sodium and potassium atoms of light in the green portion of the spectrum.
===In biology: magenta insects, birds, fish, and mammals===
===In botany===
Magenta is a common color for flowers, particularly in the tropics and sub-tropics. Because magenta is the complementary color of green, magenta flowers have the highest contrast with the green foliage, and therefore are more visible to the animals needed for their pollination.
=== In business ===
The German telecommunications company Deutsche Telekom uses a magenta logo. It has sought to prevent use of any similar color by other businesses, even those in unrelated fields, such as the insurance company Lemonade.

===In public transport===
Magenta was the English name of Tokyo&#x27;s Oedo subway line color. It was later changed to &quot;ruby&quot;.
It is also the color of the Metropolitan line of the London Underground.

=== In transportation ===
In aircraft autopilot systems, the path that pilot or plane should follow to its destination is usually indicated in cockpit displays using the color magenta.

=== In numismatics ===
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a Magenta colored banknote of ₹2000 denomination on 8 November 2016 under Mahatma Gandhi New Series. This is the highest currency note printed by RBI that is in active circulation in India.
=== In vexillology and heraldry ===
Magenta is an extremely rare color to find on heraldic flags and coats of arms, since its adoption dates back to relatively recent times. However, there are some examples of its use:
===In politics===

* Throughout much of Europe, the color of magenta (or variants of such, such as Pink or Amaranth) is used to symbolise social liberalism or classical liberalism
* The color magenta is used to symbolize anti-racism by the Amsterdam-based anti-racism Magenta Foundation.
* In Danish politics, magenta is the color of Det Radikale Venstre, the Danish social-liberal party.
* In Austrian politics, it is used to represent NEOS – The New Austria and Liberal Forum, a social liberal party.
* In Belgium, it is used by DéFI, a social liberal party.
* In Germany, Magenta is one of the colors of the Free Democratic Party, or FDP.

<doc id="46410" wikidata="Q1150056" url="?curid=46410" title="YMCK">
<text>YMCK is a Japanese chiptune band, composed of Midori Kurihara (vocals), Takeshi Yokemura (music, lyrics, arrangement), and Tomoyuki Nakamura (composition, music video).

Their work has not been confined to Japan, having released albums in Korea, Thailand and the United States as well as appearing at various events around East Asia and Europe.

YMCK&#x27;s name is derived from the CMYK subtractive color model.

==History==
YMCK was formed in May 2003 when Kurihara joined Yokemura and Nakamura. They soon released their first work; a CD-R containing 6 tracks.

In 2004, YMCK appeared at Microdisko in Stockholm, Sweden. In the same year they released their first full album, &quot;Family Music&quot;.

In 2005, YMCK again appeared outside Japan, this time at the Formoz Festival in Taipei, Taiwan and at the Fat Festival in Bangkok, Thailand. This year also marks the first release of the &quot;Magical 8bit Plug&quot;, a synthesizer developed by Yokemura himself, motivated by frustration with the quality of game sounds available in the synthesizers used for Family Music. Now making use of the Magical 8bit Plug, they released their second album: &quot;Family Racing&quot;.

In 2006, they again appeared at the Formoz Festival in Taiwan.

In 2008, YMCK released their third album &quot;Family Genesis&quot;, now under pop label Avex Trax, made available for the first time on the iTunes Store in the United States. Later that year and under the same label, they would release their first cover album, the &quot;YMCK Songbook&quot;, a collection of covers of Japanese music from the era before the NES.

In January 2009, they appeared in Sweden once again, this time at UppCon] in Uppsala, and also played in the opening ceremonies for Katsucon 15 in Arlington, Virginia (DC). In that same month they also released &quot;Family Cooking&quot;. In 2009, YMCK also remixed the No. 1 hit song Days by Japanese mega-star Ayumi Hamasaki.

During 2013, YMCK released &quot;Family Days&quot;, this time through not records. The theme of this album was said to be YMCK describing their own ordinary lives.

In 2015, they released &quot;Family Dancing&quot;.

In 2017, &quot;Family Swing&quot; was released, and for the first time they also released through Bandcamp, under U.K. chiptune label Hyperwave.

==Discography==

Note: The English is not necessarily a direct translation of the Japanese. The English titles are taken from the English version of the website. For example, track one on &quot;FAMILY RACING&quot; was actually titled &quot;FAMILY RACING&quot; instead of &quot;Opening&quot; on the Japanese release.

<doc id="46413" wikidata="Q1053574" url="?curid=46413" title="Executive producer">
<text>Executive producer (EP) is one of the top positions in the production of media. Depending on the medium, the executive producer may be concerned with management accounting or associated with legal issues (like copyrights or royalties). In films, the executive producer generally contributes to the film&#x27;s budget and their involvement depends on the project, with some simply securing funds and others being involved in the filmmaking process.

== Motion pictures ==

In films, executive producers may finance the film, participate in the creative effort, or work on set. Their responsibilities vary from funding or attracting investors into the movie project to legal, scripting, marketing, advisory and supervising capacities.

Executive producers vary in involvement, responsibility and power. Some executive producers have hands-on control over every aspect of production, some supervise the producers of a project, while others are involved in name only.

The crediting of executive producers in the film industry has risen over time. In the mid-to-late 1990s, there were an average of just under two executive producers per film. In 2000, the number jumped to 2.5 (more than the number of standard &quot;film producers&quot;). In 2013, there were an average of 4.4 executive producers per film. One reason for the increase in executive producers per film is the desire to spread risk, whether due to increasing cost of film making for larger budget films, often met by multiple studios banding together, or alternatively the need to attract multiple smaller investors for lower budget independent films.

== Television ==

In television, the executive producer credit is often applied to individuals who are involved with the production in a hands-on capacity; an executive producer usually supervises the creative content, plans and schedules the filming with the producer and team, and may be involved in the financial budgeting of a production. Some writers, like Aaron Sorkin, Stephen J. Cannell, Tina Fey, and Ryan Murphy, have worked as both the creator and the producer of the same show. 

As in film, executive producer credits in television are also commonly applied to individuals who are involved in the production in a more hands-off capacity, such as the owner of the show&#x27;s production company. In the case of multiple executive producers on a television show, the one responsible for day-to-day production is usually called the showrunner, or the leading executive producer.

==Music==

In recorded music, record labels distinguish between an executive producer and a record producer. The executive producer is responsible for business decisions and more recently, organizing the recordings along with the music producer, whereas the record producer makes the music. Sometimes the executive producer organizes the recording and selects recording-related crew, such as sound engineers and session musicians.

== Video games ==

In the video game industry, the title &quot;executive producer&quot; is not well-defined. It may refer to an external producer working for the publisher, who works with the developers. 

For example, in 2012, Jay-Z was announced as executive producer for &quot;NBA 2K13&quot;. His role consisted of appearing in an introduction, picking songs for the game&#x27;s soundtrack and contributing to the designs of its in-game menus &quot;and other visual elements&quot;.

== Radio ==

An executive radio producer helps create, develop, and implement strategies to improve product and ratings.

<text>A crayon (or wax pastel) is a stick of pigmented wax used for writing or drawing. Wax crayons differ from pastels, in which the pigment is mixed with a dry binder such as gum arabic, and from oil pastels, where the binder is a mixture of wax and oil.

Crayons are available in a range of prices, and are easy to work with. They are less messy than most paints and markers, blunt (removing the risk of sharp points present when using a pencil or pen), typically non-toxic, and available in a wide variety of colors. These characteristics make them particularly good instruments for teaching small children to draw in addition to being used widely by student and professional artists.

==Composition==
In the modern English-speaking world, the term crayon is commonly associated with the standard wax crayon, such as those widely available for use by children. Such crayons are usually approximately in length and made mostly of paraffin wax. Paraffin wax is heated and cooled to achieve the correct temperature at which a usable wax substance can be dyed and then manufactured and shipped for use around the world. Paraffin waxes are used for cosmetics, candles, for the preparation of printing ink, fruit preserving, in the pharmaceutical industry, for lubricating purposes, and crayons.

Colin Snedeker, a chemist for Binney &amp; Smith (the then-parent company of Crayola), developed the first washable crayons in response to consumer complaints regarding stained fabrics and walls. A patent for the washable solid marking composition utilized in the washable crayons was awarded to Snedeker in 1990.

==History==

The history of the crayon is not entirely clear. The French word &quot;crayon&quot;, originally meaning &quot;chalk pencil&quot;, dates to around the 16th century, and is derived from the word &quot;craie&quot; (chalk), which comes from the Latin word &quot;creta&quot; (Earth). The meaning later changed to simply &quot;pencil&quot;, which it still means in modern French.

The notion to combine a form of wax with pigment goes back thousands of years. Encaustic painting is a technique that uses hot beeswax combined with colored pigment to bind color into stone. A heat source was then used to &quot;burn in&quot; and fix the image in place. Pliny the Elder, a Roman scholar, was thought to describe the first techniques of wax crayon drawings.

This method, employed by the Egyptians, Romans, Greeks, and indigenous people in the Philippines, is still used today. However, the process was not used to make crayons into a form intended to be held and colored with and was therefore ineffective for use in a classroom or as crafts for children.

Contemporary crayons are purported to have originated in Europe, where some of the first cylinder shaped crayons were made with charcoal and oil. Pastels are an art medium sharing roots with the modern crayon and date back to Leonardo da Vinci in 1495. Conté crayons, out of Paris, are a hybrid between a pastel and a conventional crayon, used since the late 1790s as a drawing crayon for artists. Later, various hues of powdered pigment eventually replaced the primary charcoal ingredient found in most early 19th century products. References to crayons in literature appear as early as 1813 in Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. French lithographer was also one of the inventors of the modern crayon. Through his Paris business circa 1828, he produced a variety of crayon and color related products. But even as those in Europe were discovering that substituting wax for the oil strengthened the crayon, various efforts in the United States were also developing.
The initial era of wax crayons saw several companies and products competing for the lucrative education and artist markets. The Franklin Mfg. Co, founded in 1876 in Rochester, New York, was one of the first companies to make and sell wax crayons, and in 1883 they appeared with a display of crayons at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition that year.

Some of the earliest records of the modern paraffin wax crayon comes from Charles A. Bowley of Massachusetts, who developed wax coloring crayons in the late 1880s. Bowley had been selling various stationery items in the vicinity of Danvers and had developed clumps of colored wax designed for marking leather. With the need for more accuracy, he went back to his home and formed the wax crayons into more manageable cylinder shapes similar to that of a pencil. He packaged his crayons into decorative boxes and offered them through stationer clients he knew. The demand for his crayons soon exceeded his ability to keep up with production and he partnered with the American Crayon Company, who had been producing chalk crayons, in 1902.

Edwin Binney and C. Harold Smith had been long established in the coloring marketplace through Binney&#x27;s Peekskill, New York, chemical works making lampblack by burning whale and carbon black, as well as their chalk products. In 1902, they developed and introduced the Staonal marking crayon. A year later in 1903, Edwin Binney&#x27;s wife, Alice Stead Binney, coined the name Crayola by combining the French word for chalk, &quot;craie&quot;, with the first part of &quot;oleaginous&quot;, another name for the paraffin wax used to make the crayon. Binney and Smith were quick to capitalize on their creation, selling boxes of various sizes and color pallets. The Rubens Crayola line started in 1903 as well, aimed at artist and designed to compete with the Raphael brand of crayons from Europe.
Their most recognizable brand was the Crayola &quot;Gold Medal&quot; line in yellow boxes, which referred to one the company earned with their An-du-Septic dustless chalk during the March 1904 St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair. They used the award to design a new line of crayons featuring the medal on the front of their box. Initially, they developed and introduced the No. 8 box of eight assorted colors, which became an immediate success; it was even featured on a postage stamp in early 1905. From there they began to phase out other Crayola crayon boxes until their line of Crayola crayons featured the Gold Medal design.

Hundreds of companies entered the crayon market, but only a few exist today, with Crayola dominating the market in the United States. That brand become a generic trademark also used to describe other brands&#x27; crayons. In all, there were over 300 documented crayon manufacturers in the United States and many more in other countries.

===Today===

Beyond Crayola, other brand name crayon manufacturers today include Rose Art Industries and Dixon Ticonderoga, the successor to the American Crayon Company. Numerous suppliers create generic brand or store brand crayons. These are typically found in supermarkets.

In 2000, there was concern about potential contamination of asbestos in many popular brands of crayons after the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; reported in May of that year that they had tests performed finding that three brands of crayons contained asbestos. In a follow-up study released in June the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) found traces of asbestos fibers in three crayons and larger amounts of transitional fibers which can be misinterpreted as asbestos as a result of using talc as a binding agent in additional crayons. CPSC declared the risk to be low, but said that because of the concerns it had asked manufacturers to reformulate the concerned crayons and commended them for their swift agreement to do so.

==Artists==
Early French artists, including François Clouet (1510–1572) and Nicholas L&#x27;agneau (1590–1666), used crayons in their early art projects. Clouet used crayons for his modeled portraits, which were so elaborate that he caught the attention of Henry V, who knighted him. He became a court painter for the royalty, and his entire art career began with and consisted of wax crayon art. L&#x27;agneau illustrated his portraits with outlines in wax crayons, and with tints of watercolor. His portraits were often of people who looked surprised or unaware of their surroundings.

Sister Gertrude Morgan was most known for preaching the Gospel around New Orleans with simplicity and easy-to-understand crayon drawings. Morgan caught the eye of a gallery owner E. Lorenz Borenstein, and was allowed to show her work, play her music and spread her word of God at the gallery. Her early drawings were that of just very modest and simplicity crayon drawings, depicting biblical text to provide a clearer image to those who were unfamiliar with the Bible. Morgan went on to publish a record of her biblical songs and has artwork featured in the American Folk Art Museum in New York.

<text>West Ham United Football Club is a professional football club based in Stratford, East London, England. The club competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. The club plays at the London Stadium, having moved from their former home, the Boleyn Ground, in 2016.

West Ham United was founded in 1895 as Thames Ironworks and reformed in 1900 as West Ham United. It moved to the Boleyn Ground, which remained its home ground for more than a century, in 1904. The team initially competed in the Southern League and Western League before joining the Football League in 1919. It was promoted to the top flight in 1923, when it was also losing finalist in the first FA Cup final held at Wembley. In 1940, the club won the inaugural Football League War Cup.

West Ham United has won five major honours in its history. Domestically, it has been winner of the FA Cup three times (1964, 1975 and 1980) and runner-up twice (1923 and 2006). In European competitions, the club has reached three major European finals winning the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1965, finishing runner-up in the same competitions in 1976, and winning the second edition of the Conference League in 2023. The club has also won one minor European trophy by winning the Intertoto Cup in 1999. West Ham United is one of eight clubs never to have fallen below the second tier of English football, spending 66 of 98 league seasons in the top flight, up to and including the 2023–24 season. The club&#x27;s highest league position to date came in 1985–86, when it achieved third place in the then First Division.

Three West Ham players were members of the 1966 World Cup finals-winning England team: captain Bobby Moore and goalscorers Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters. The club has a long-standing rivalry with Millwall, and the fixture has gained notoriety for frequent incidents of football hooliganism. West Ham adopted their claret and sky blue colour scheme in the early 1900s, with the most common iteration of a claret shirt and sky blue sleeves first emerging in 1904.

==History==
===Origins===
The earliest generally accepted incarnation of West Ham United was founded in 1895 as Thames Ironworks F.C., the works team of the largest and last surviving shipbuilder on the Thames, Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company, by foreman and local league referee Dave Taylor and owner Arnold Hills and was announced in the &quot;Thames Ironworks Gazette&quot; of June 1895. Thames Ironworks was based in Leamouth Wharf in Blackwall and Canning Town on both banks of the River Lea, where the Lea meets the Thames. Thames Ironworks built many ships and other structures, the most famous being . The last ship built there was the dreadnought in 1912 and the yard shut soon after.

The repair yard of the Castle Shipping Line was a very near neighbour and their work team, initially known as the Castle Swifts, would informally merge with the Thames Ironworks own team.

The team played on a strictly amateur basis for 1895 at least, with a team featuring a number of works employees. Thomas Freeman was a ships fireman and Walter Parks, a clerk. Johnny Stewart, Walter Tranter and James Lindsay were all boilermakers. Other employees included William Chapman, George Sage and Fred Chamberlain, as well as apprentice riveter Charlie Dove, who was to have a great influence on the club&#x27;s future at a later date.
Thames Ironworks won the West Ham Charity Cup, contested by clubs in the West Ham locality, in 1895, then won the London League in 1897. They turned professional in 1898 upon entering the Southern League Second Division, and were promoted to the First Division at the first attempt. The following year they came second from bottom, but had established themselves as a fully-fledged competitive team. They comfortably fended off the challenge of local rivals Fulham in a relegation play-off, 5–1 in late April 1900 and retained their First Division status.

The team initially played in full dark blue kits, as inspired by Mr. Hills, who had been an Oxford University &quot;Blue&quot;, but changed the following season by adopting the sky blue shirts and white shorts combination worn from 1897 to 1899.

Following growing disputes over the running and financing of the club, in June 1900 Thames Ironworks F.C. was disbanded, then almost immediately relaunched as West Ham United F.C. – reflecting the West Ham, London district where they played – on 5 July 1900 with Syd King as their manager and future manager Charlie Paynter as his assistant. Because of the original &quot;works team&quot; roots and links (still represented upon the club badge), they are still known as &quot;the Irons&quot; or &quot;the Hammers&quot; amongst fans and the media.

===Birth of West Ham United (1901–1961)===
West Ham United joined the Western League for the 1901 season while also continuing to play in the Southern Division 1. In 1907, West Ham were crowned the Western League Division 1B Champions, and then defeated 1A champions Fulham 1–0 to become the Western League Overall Champions. The reborn club continued to play their games at the Memorial Grounds in Plaistow (funded by Arnold Hills) but moved to a pitch in the Upton Park area in the guise of the Boleyn Ground stadium in 1904. West Ham&#x27;s first game in their new home was against fierce rivals Millwall (themselves an Ironworks team, albeit for a rival company) drawing a crowd of 10,000 and with West Ham running out 3–0 winners, and as the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; wrote on 2 September 1904, &quot;Favoured by the weather turning fine after heavy rains of the morning, West Ham United began their season most auspiciously yesterday evening; when they beat Millwall by 3 goals to 0 on their new enclosure at Upton Park.&quot;

In 1919, still under King&#x27;s leadership, West Ham gained entrance to the Football League Second Division, their first game being a 1–1 draw with Lincoln City, and were promoted to the First Division in 1923, also making it to the first ever FA Cup final to be held at the old Wembley Stadium. Their opponents were Bolton Wanderers. This was also known as the &quot;White Horse final&quot;, so named because an estimated 200,000 people came to see the match and the crowd was spilling out on to the pitch, which had to be cleared prior to kick-off by &quot;Billie&quot;, a giant white horse (actually grey) being ridden by PC George Scorey. The cup final match itself ended 2–0 to Bolton. The team enjoyed mixed success in the First Division but retained their status for ten years and reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1933.

In 1932, the club was relegated to the Second Division and long-term custodian Syd King was sacked after serving the club in the role of manager for 32 years, and as a player from 1899 to 1903. Following relegation, King had mental health problems. He appeared drunk at a board meeting and killed himself soon after. He was replaced with his assistant manager Charlie Paynter, who himself had been with West Ham in a number of roles since 1897 and who went on to serve the team in this role until 1950 for a total of 480 games. The club spent most of the next thirty years in the second division, first under Paynter and then later under the leadership of former player Ted Fenton.

Fenton succeeded in getting the club promoted back to the top level of English football in 1958. With the considerable input of player Malcolm Allison, Fenton helped develop both the initial batch of future West Ham stars and West Ham&#x27;s approach to the game.

===Glory years (1961–1986)===
Ron Greenwood was appointed as Fenton&#x27;s successor in 1961 and soon led the club to two major trophies, winning the 1964 FA Cup Final. The team was led by the young Bobby Moore. West Ham also won the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup the following year. During the 1966 World Cup, key members of the tournament winners England were West Ham players, including the captain, Bobby Moore; Martin Peters (who scored in the final); and Geoff Hurst, who scored the first hat-trick in a World Cup final. All three players had come through the youth team at West Ham. 
There is a &quot;Champions&quot; statue in Barking Road, opposite The Boleyn Tavern, commemorating West Ham&#x27;s &quot;three sons&quot; who helped win the 1966 World Cup: Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters. Also included on the statue is Everton&#x27;s Ray Wilson.

After a difficult start to the 1974–75 season, Greenwood moved himself &quot;upstairs&quot; to become general manager and, without informing the board, appointed his assistant John Lyall as team manager. The result was instant success – the team scored 20 goals in their first four games and won the FA Cup, becoming the last team to win the FA Cup with an all-English side when they beat Fulham 2–0 in the 1975 final. The Fulham team included two former England captains, Alan Mullery and West Ham legend Bobby Moore. Lyall then guided West Ham to another European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final in 1976, though the team lost the match 4–2 to Belgian side Anderlecht. Greenwood&#x27;s tenure as general manager lasted less than three years, as he was appointed to manage England in the wake of Don Revie&#x27;s resignation in 1977.

In 1978, West Ham were again relegated to the Second Division, but Lyall was retained as manager and led the team to victory in the 1980 FA Cup final with a 1–0 win against Arsenal, the most recent time a team from outside the top flight has won the FA Cup. They reached the final by defeating Everton in the semi-final. West Ham were promoted to the First Division in 1981, and finished in the top ten of the First Division for the next three seasons before achieving their highest-ever league finish of third in 1985–86; a group of players which came to be known as The Boys of 86.

===Ups and downs (1986–2005)===
However, the &quot;Hammers&quot; suffered relegation again in 1989, which resulted in Lyall&#x27;s sacking. He was awarded an &quot;ex gratia&quot; payment of () but left the club in what Lyall described as &quot;upsetting&quot; circumstances, meriting only 73 words in a terse acknowledgement of his service in the club programme. Lyall left West Ham after 34 years&#x27; service.

After Lyall, Lou Macari briefly led the team, though he resigned after less than a single season in order to clear his name of allegations of illegal betting while manager of Swindon Town.
He was replaced by former player Billy Bonds. In Bonds&#x27; first full season, 1990–91, West Ham again secured promotion to the First Division. Now back in the top flight, Bonds saw West Ham through one of their most controversial seasons. With the club planning to introduce a bond scheme, there was crowd unrest. West Ham finished last and were relegated back to the Second Division after only one season. However, they rebounded strongly in 1992–93. With Trevor Morley and Clive Allen scoring 40 goals, they guaranteed themselves second place on the last day of the season with a 2–0 home win against Cambridge United, and with it promotion to the Premier League.
With the team in the Premier League, there was a need to rebuild the team. Oxford United player Joey Beauchamp was recruited for a fee of £1.2 million (equivalent to £ million in ). Shortly after arriving at the club, however, he became unhappy, citing homesickness from his native Oxford as the reason. Bonds in particular found this attitude hard to understand compared to his own committed, never-say-die approach; providing for Bonds&#x27; further evidence of the decay in the modern game and modern player. Fifty-eight days later, Beauchamp was signed by Swindon Town for a club-record combined fee of £800,000 (equivalent to £ million in ), which included defender Adrian Whitbread going in the opposite direction. Whitbread was valued at £750,000 (equivalent to £ million in ) in the deal.

Assistant manager Harry Redknapp was also now taking a bigger role in the transfer of players, with the club&#x27;s approval. With rumours of his old club AFC Bournemouth being prepared to offer him a position, the West Ham board and their managing director, Peter Storrie, made a controversial move. The board were anxious not to lose Redknapp&#x27;s services and offered Bonds a place away from the day-to-day affairs of the club on the West Ham board. This would have allowed them to appoint Redknapp as manager. Bonds refused the post offered and walked away from the club. His accusations of deceit and manipulation by the board and by Redknapp have continued to cause ill-feeling. Peter Storrie claimed that they had handled the situation correctly, saying, &quot;If Harry had gone to Bournemouth, there was a good chance Bill would have resigned anyway, so we were in a no-win situation. We&#x27;re sad that Bill is going, and it&#x27;s a big blow but it&#x27;s time to move on and we have appointed a great manager.&quot;
Redknapp became manager on 10 August 1994.

Redknapp&#x27;s seven years as manager was notable for the turnover of players during his tenure and for the level of attractive football and success which had not been seen since the managership of John Lyall. Over 134 players passed through the club while he was manager, producing a net transfer fee deficit of £16 million, despite the £18 million sale (equivalent to £ million in ) of Rio Ferdinand to Leeds United in 2000. Some were notably successful, such as the signings of Stuart Pearce, Trevor Sinclair, Paolo Di Canio, John Hartson, Eyal Berkovic and Ian Wright. Meanwhile, some were expensive, international players who failed at West Ham, such as Florin Raducioiu; Davor Šuker, who earned as much in wages as the revenue gained from one entire stand and yet made only eight appearances; Christian Bassila, who cost £720,000 (equivalent to £ million in ) and played only 86 minutes of football; Titi Camara; Gary Charles, whose wages amounted to £4.4 million (equivalent to £ million in ) but made only three starts for the club; Rigobert Song; Paulo Futre; and Marco Boogers, a player often quoted as one of the biggest failures in the Premier League. His first season in charge saw West Ham fighting the threat of relegation until the last few weeks, while his third season would also see another relegation battle. Always willing to enter the transfer market, Redknapp bought in the winter transfer window John Hartson and Paul Kitson, who added the impetus needed at the season&#x27;s end.

In 1999, West Ham finished fifth, their highest position in the top flight since 1986. They also won the Intertoto Cup beating French club Metz to qualify for the 1999–2000 UEFA Cup. Things began to falter for Redknapp with the sale of Ferdinand to Leeds in November 2000. Redknapp used the transfer money poorly with purchases such as Ragnvald Soma, who cost £800,000 (equivalent to £ million in ) and played only seven league games, Camara, and Song. Redknapp felt he needed more funds with which to deal in the transfer market. Chairman Brown lost patience with Redknapp due to his demands for further transfer funds. In June 2001, called to a meeting with Brown expecting to discuss contracts, he was fired. His assistant Frank Lampard left too, making the sale of his son, Frank Lampard Jr., inevitable; in the summer of 2001, he joined Chelsea for £11 million (equivalent to £ million in ).

With several names, such as former player Alan Curbishley, now linked with the job, Chairman Brown recruited from within the club, appointing reserve team coach Glenn Roeder as manager on 9 May 2001. He had already failed in management with Gillingham, where he lost 22 of the 35 games he managed, and Watford. His first big signings were the return of Don Hutchison for £5 million (equivalent to £ million in ) and Czech centre back Tomáš Řepka. Finishing seventh in his first season Roeder, in his office at Upton Park, suffered a blocked blood vessel in his brain. As Roeder needed medical help and recuperation, former stalwart Trevor Brooking stood in as caretaker manager. Despite not losing another game, the Hammers were relegated on the last day of the season at Birmingham City, with a record high for a relegated club of 42 points from a 38-game season. Ten seasons of top-tier football were over. Many top players, including Joe Cole, Di Canio and Kanouté, all left the club.

The next season, now in the second tier, Roeder resumed his stint as manager. Results were still poor, however, and after an away defeat to Rotherham United, he was sacked on 24 August 2003. Brooking again took over as caretaker. He lost only one game, a 2–0 away defeat to Gillingham and is known as &quot;the best manager West Ham never had.&quot;

Former Crystal Palace player and manager of Reading Alan Pardew was lined up to be the next bench boss. Reading and their chairman, John Madejski, however, were reluctant to let him leave. After serving a period of notice and gardening leave, and with West Ham paying Reading £380,000 () in compensation, he was appointed manager on 18 October 2003, their tenth manager. Pardew set out to rebuild the side bringing in Nigel Reo-Coker, Marlon Harewood and Brian Deane. In his first season in charge, they made the playoff final only to lose to Crystal Palace. His signings of Bobby Zamora, Matthew Etherington and veterans Chris Powell and Teddy Sheringham saw West Ham finishing sixth and subsequently beat Preston North End 1–0 thanks to a Zamora goal in the 2005 playoff final, securing a return to the Premier League. After ensuring promotion, Pardew said, &quot;It&#x27;s a team effort. We defended well and we&#x27;re back where we belong.&quot;

===Final years at the Boleyn (2005–2016)===
On their return to the top division, West Ham finished in ninth place,&lt;ref name=&quot;Final 2005/2006 English Premier Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The highlight of the 2005–06 season, however, was reaching the FA Cup final and taking favourites Liverpool to a penalty shootout after a 3–3 draw. West Ham lost the shootout, but nonetheless gained entry to the following season&#x27;s UEFA Cup as Liverpool had already qualified for the Champions League. In August 2006, West Ham completed a major coup on the last day of the transfer window after completing the signings of Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano. The club was eventually bought by an Icelandic consortium, led by Eggert Magnússon, in November 2006. Manager Alan Pardew was sacked after poor form during the season and was replaced by former Charlton Athletic manager Alan Curbishley.

The signings of Mascherano and Tevez were investigated by the Premier League, who were concerned that details of the transfers had been omitted from official records. The club was found guilty and fined £5.5 million in April 2007. However, West Ham avoided a points deduction which ultimately became critical in their avoidance of relegation at the end of the 2006–07 season. Following on from this event, Wigan Athletic chairman Dave Whelan, supported by other sides facing possible relegation, including Fulham and Sheffield United, threatened legal action. West Ham escaped relegation by winning seven of their last nine games, including a 1–0 win over Arsenal, and on the last day of the season defeated newly crowned League Champions Manchester United 1–0 with a goal by Tevez to finish 15th.

In the 2007–08 season, West Ham remained reasonably consistently in the top half of the league table, with Freddie Ljungberg in the team, despite a slew of injuries; new signing Craig Bellamy missed most of the campaign, while Kieron Dyer was out from August 2007. The last game of the season, at the Boleyn Ground, saw West Ham draw 2–2 against Aston Villa, ensuring a tenth-place finish three points ahead of rivals Tottenham Hotspur. It was a five-place improvement on the previous season, and most importantly West Ham were never under any realistic threat of relegation.

After a row with the board over the sale of defenders Anton Ferdinand and George McCartney to Sunderland, manager Alan Curbishley resigned on 3 September 2008. His successor was former Chelsea striker Gianfranco Zola, who took over on 11 September 2008 to become the club&#x27;s first non-British manager. In the 2008–09 season, West Ham finished ninth, a single place improvement.

In the 2009–10 season, West Ham started strongly with a 2–0 win over newly promoted Wolverhampton Wanderers, with goals from Mark Noble and newly appointed captain Matthew Upson. A League Cup match against old rivals Millwall brought about violent riots outside the ground as well as pitch invasions and crowd trouble inside Upton Park.
In August 2009, the financial concerns of Icelandic owners parent companies left the current owners unable to provide any funds until a new owner was found. The club&#x27;s shirt sponsor SBOBET provided the club with help to purchase a much needed striker, the Italian Alessandro Diamanti.

West Ham had a poor season which involved a prolonged battle against relegation. They finally secured their survival with two games remaining by defeating Wigan 3–2. The club managed to take 35 points from 38 games, seven fewer than the total they had when relegated seven years prior.
On 11 May 2010, two days after the end of the 2009–10 season, West Ham announced the termination of Zola&#x27;s contract with immediate effect. On 3 June 2010, Avram Grant signed a four-year deal to become the next manager of West Ham subject to a work permit. West Ham&#x27;s form continued to be poor with the team seldom outside the relegation zone, placing Grant&#x27;s future as manager under serious doubt. A 4–0 Football League Cup quarter-final win over Manchester United was an otherwise bright spot in a disappointing season. West Ham&#x27;s form in the Premier League did not affect their form in the two domestic cups. The Hammers reached the semi-final of the League Cup before being eliminated by eventual winners Birmingham City as well as the quarter-final of the FA Cup before a 2–1 defeat at eventual runners-up Stoke City.

On 15 May 2011, West Ham&#x27;s relegation to the Championship was confirmed after a comeback from Wigan at the DW Stadium. With West Ham leading 2–0 at half-time through two Demba Ba goals, Wigan battled back to win 3–2 thanks to an added-time strike from Charles N&#x27;Zogbia. Following the loss, West Ham announced the sacking of manager Avram Grant just one season into his tenure. On 1 June 2011, Sam Allardyce was appointed as manager as Grant&#x27;s replacement.

The club finished third in the 2011–12 Football League Championship with 86 points and took part in the play-offs. They beat Cardiff City in the play-off semi-final 5–0 on aggregate to reach the final against Blackpool at Wembley on 19 May 2012. Carlton Cole opened the scoring, and although Blackpool equalised early in the second half, Ricardo Vaz Tê scored the winner for West Ham in the 87th minute.

West Ham, on their return to the Premier League, signed former players James Collins and George McCartney on permanent deals, as well as record signing Matt Jarvis and Andy Carroll on loan. They won their first game of the season, on 18 August 2012, 1–0 against Aston Villa thanks to a Kevin Nolan goal. The highlight of the first half of the season was a 3–1 home win against reigning European champions Chelsea on 1 December 2012 which saw them in eighth position and 12th at the end of the year. On 22 March 2013, West Ham secured a 99-year lease deal on the Olympic Stadium, with it planned to be used as their home ground from the 2016–17 season. Tenth place was secured at the end of the season with nine home wins and only three away from home. Only 11 away goals were scored, the lowest of the entire league.

In 2013–14, West Ham finished 13th in the Premier League. They also reached the semi-finals of the League Cup before losing 9–0 on aggregate to eventual cup-winners Manchester City. A feature of the season were the criticisms of manager Sam Allardyce by supporters relating to his perceived negative playing tactics. West Ham finished 12th in the 2014–15 Premier League, one place higher than the previous season. Minutes after the last game of the season, on 24 May 2015, the club announced that Allardyce&#x27;s contract would not be renewed and that they were seeking a new manager. By winning the Premier League Fair Play table for 2014–15, West Ham qualified for the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League, entering at the first qualifying round.

On 9 June 2015, former West Ham player Slaven Bilić was appointed as manager on a three-year contract. In Bilić&#x27;s fourth game in charge, the team won at Anfield for the first time in 52 years, beating Liverpool 0–3, with goals from Manuel Lanzini, Mark Noble and Diafra Sakho. At the end of the season, West Ham finished 7th in the Premier League. The team broke several records for the club in the Premier League era, including the highest number of points (62), the highest number of goals in a season (65), the fewest games lost in a season (8) and the lowest number of away defeats (5). The season also marked the last season where the team played at the Boleyn Ground, with them moving to the London Stadium from next season – ending their 112-year stay at the stadium.

===Move to London Stadium and European success (2016–)===
Following Manchester United&#x27;s win in the 2016 FA Cup final, West Ham took their Europa League place and qualified for the third qualifying round of the 2016–17 edition. At the end of the first season at the London Stadium, the team finished 11th, along with having to deal with the departure of star man Dimitri Payet. However, the team suffered a poor start to the following season, taking only two wins in their opening 11 games. Following a 4–1 defeat to Liverpool at home and with the team threatened by relegation, Bilić was sacked on 6 November 2017. He was replaced by former Sunderland boss David Moyes on a contract until the end of the season. The team battled inconsistent form for the rest of the season but managed to avoid relegation and finish 13th. Moyes was not offered a new contract and left the club on the expiration of it on 16 May 2018.

On 22 May 2018, the club appointed former Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini as the new manager on a three-year contract. In his first season in charge, the Hammers finished 10th, once again suffering from inconsistent form. However, after a poor first half to the following season, Pellegrini was sacked in December 2019 with the team only one point above the relegation zone. His last game in charge was a 2–1 home loss to Leicester City. He was replaced by David Moyes, who returned for a second spell in charge a day later.

On 22 July 2020, the club secured their Premier League status for another season, following a 1–1 draw away to Manchester United. Ahead of the 2020–21 season, West Ham&#x27;s ownership attracted criticism, including from club captain Mark Noble who publicly criticized the sale of academy graduate Grady Diangana. Despite losing the opening two games of the season, West Ham&#x27;s form improved and by the end of November, the club sat in fifth place. The club would not drop out of a European spot for the rest of the season and went on to qualify for the 2021–22 UEFA Europa League group stages after finishing in 6th. Moyes signed a new three-year contract on 12 June 2021.

West Ham won their first three games of the year 2022, temporarily elevating the club to fourth place in the Premier League. The team beat Sevilla 2–1 on aggregate to reach a first European quarter-final in 41 years, followed by a 4–1 aggregate win over Lyon for a first such semi-final since 1976. Playing the same opposition they met in their 1976 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup semi-final, Eintracht Frankfurt, the &quot;Hammers&quot; were knocked out of the Europa League, following a 3–1 aggregate loss to the German side. At the end of the 2021–22 Premier League season, West Ham confirmed a second successive season of European football, qualifying for the UEFA Europa Conference League after finishing seventh. The season was also notable for being Mark Noble&#x27;s final as a West Ham player, with the midfielder retiring from football after 18 years as a first team player at the club, making 550 appearances in all competitions, scoring 62 times. By finishing 7th in the 2021–22 Premier League, West Ham qualified for the 2022–23 Europa Conference League, entering at the play-off stage.

The 2022–23 campaign was a mixed bag for the &quot;Hammers&quot;. The club finished 14th in the Premier League, only securing their Premier League status with two games remaining and exiting the League Cup to lower league opposition in a season that saw manager David Moyes come under pressure. In January 2023, Mark Noble returned to the club as sporting director. Despite the troubles in West Ham&#x27;s domestic campaign, they excelled in the Europa Conference League. The club progressed to the final unbeaten, winning 13 games and drawing just once. They went on to win the competition, defeating Fiorentina 2–1 in the final to claim their first major trophy since 1980 and their first European trophy in 58 years. Moyes was not offered a new contract in 2024, having led West Ham to three consecutive European seasons for the first time in their history, reaching at least the quarter-finals of each. On 23 May the club named Julen Lopetegui as his replacement.
He was sacked on 8 January 2025 with the team in 14th position, seven points above the relegation positions; during his tenure, they lost nine of 20 Premier League games.
On 9 January Graham Potter was appointed as head coach signing a two–and–a–half year contract.

==Crest==

===Thames Ironworks FC===
The Thames Ironworks Team (1895–1900) used the Union Flag as its badge.

===Rivet Hammers===
The principal element of the badge is the crossed pair of rivet hammers, tools that were used in the shipbuilding industry. The Blackwall and Canning Town neighbourhoods surrounding the Thames Ironworks echoed to the sound of hammers; steam hammers, sledge hammers and rivet hammers.

Seven large mechanical steam hammers would punch small holes near the edges of the iron plates which would be joined to build the ships. The plates would be put in place and fixed together with rivets by teams of five, three inside the emerging vessel and two outside.

Inside the ship one member of the team would heat the rivets till they were white hot and, using &quot;Iron Fingers&quot; (blacksmith&#x27;s tongs), throw them to a second person, known as a &quot;catch-boy&quot; or &quot;putter-in&quot;, who would pick the rivet up and place it the hole, also using tongs. The third person was known as the &quot;holder-on&quot; and he would then smash the rivet home with a sixteen-pound sledgehammer and then use his sledgehammer to hold the rivet in place while the men on the other side flattened the other end of the rivet.

Outside the ship, exposed to the elements, two men with rivet hammers – one right-handed, one left-handed – would hammer the protruding and still glowing rivet flat, so securing one of the many points necessary to link each of the ship&#x27;s large plates.

The crossed hammers were also incorporated into the coat of arms of the County Borough of West Ham and those of its successor, the modern London Borough of Newham. The Thames Ironworks lay partly within what is now the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. However, the blacksmith&#x27;s tongs in that Borough&#x27;s coat of arms represent the local saint, Dunstan, the patron saint of Stepney and metalworkers, rather than the Ironworks.

===Tower===
A yellow or white tower was added, intermittently, from the 1950s onwards. The primary reason for this seems to be to represent &quot;Anne Boleyn&#x27;s Tower&quot;, the most notable feature of Green Street House, an originally Tudor group of buildings which stood next to the Boleyn Ground until demolished in 1955. Green Street House was also known as &quot;Boleyn Castle&quot; through an association with Anne Boleyn. The manor was reputedly one of the sites at which Henry VIII courted his second queen, though there is no documentary evidence to support the tradition.

There are a number of other factors which may have influenced the inclusion of the stylised castle feature, for instance:
* to reflect the contribution made to the club by players of Old Castle Swifts
* The imposing towers, roofs and doorway of the Engineering Department of the Thames Ironworks bore a strong resemblance to the castle feature in earlier iterations of the badge.
* The first verse of the club&#x27;s anthem I&#x27;m forever blowing bubbles begins &quot;I&#x27;m dreaming dreams, I&#x27;m scheming schemes, I&#x27;m building castles high&quot;.
* The White Tower of the Tower of London as emblematic of East London. For hundreds of years, up until 1900, inner East London had been known as the Tower Division, an area which owed military service to the Tower of London. The (originally whitewashed) White Tower was used as insignia for the area, for instance on cap badges of local units of the army.
* In recognition of the &#x27;West Ham Pals&#x27;, the 13th Battalion of the Essex Regiment which was raised in Stratford in 1915 and saw extensive action and heavy losses on the Western Front in the World War I. The Battalion was formed from volunteers from West Ham and East London generally. Their war cry was &quot;Up the Hammers&quot;. The cap badge of the Essex Regiment was the castle and key of Gibraltar, though the unit made an unsuccessful request to the War Office that crossed hammers could be used instead.
* The adoption (in 1904) of Boleyn Castle FC as the club&#x27;s reserve side when they took over their grounds on the site.

===Shield===
A shield has been used in many iterations of the club badge, and the shape of the 2016 version matches the cross-section on the hull of HMS Warrior, the most famous ship built by the Thames Ironworks.

===Iterations===
The crest was redesigned and updated in the late 1990s, featuring a wider yellow castle with fewer cruciform &quot;windows&quot; along with the peaked roofs being removed; the tops of the towers had previously made the castle appear more akin to Disneyland&#x27;s Sleeping Beauty&#x27;s Castle than a functioning fortress. The designer also altered other details to give a more substantial feel to the iconography.

When the club rebuilt the west stand of the Boleyn Ground (construction finished 2001–02) the &quot;castle&quot; from the redesigned badge was incorporated into the structure at the main entrance to the ground. A pair of towers were prominent features of the ground&#x27;s appearance, both bearing large club badges.

A new badge was introduced following the end of the 2015–16 season, when the club moved into the Olympic Stadium. It removes the Boleyn Castle due to the club moving away, leaving just the crossed hammers, which the club says is inspired by the crest before and during the career of Bobby Moore. The word &quot;London&quot; was introduced below to &quot;establish the club firmly on the international stage&quot;, and the more minimalist approach is to give a &quot;strong statement that is instantly West Ham United&quot;. The shape of the crest is that of the hull of , the first ironclad warship in the Royal Navy, which was built by Thames Ironworks.

==Colours==

The original colours of the team were dark blue, due to Thames Ironworks chairman Arnold Hills being a former student of Oxford University (see Oxford blue). However, the team used a variety of kits including the claret and sky blue house colours of Thames Ironworks, as well as sky blue or white kit.

The Irons permanently adopted claret and blue for home colours in 1903.

One story suggests that Thames Ironworks right-half Charlie Dove received the Aston Villa kit from William Belton, who was a professional sprinter of national repute, as well as being involved with the coaching at Thames Ironworks. Belton had been at a fair in Birmingham, close to Villa Park, the home ground of Aston Villa and was challenged to a race against four Villa players, who wagered money that one of them would win. Belton defeated them and, when they were unable to pay the bet, one of the Villa players who was responsible for washing the team&#x27;s kit offered a complete team&#x27;s &quot;football kits&quot; to Belton in payment. The Aston Villa player subsequently reported to his club that the kit was &quot;missing&quot;. This, however, is often disputed.

Thames Ironworks, and later West Ham United, retained the claret yoke/blue sleeves design, but also continued to use their previously favoured colours for their away kits.

==Supporters, hooliganism and rivalries==

===Supporters===
The team&#x27;s supporters are famous for their rendition of the chorus of their team&#x27;s anthem, &quot;I&#x27;m Forever Blowing Bubbles&quot; introduced to the club by former manager Charlie Paynter in the late 1920s. A Pears soap commercial featuring the curly haired child in the Millais&#x27; &quot;Bubbles&quot; was well known at the time. The child resembled a player, Billy J. &quot;Bubbles&quot; Murray, from local schoolboy team, Park School, where the headmaster was Cornelius Beal. Beal was known locally for his music and rhyme and wrote special words to the tune of &quot;I&#x27;m Forever Blowing Bubbles&quot; whenever any player was having a good game.

Beal was a friend of Paynter, while Murray was a West Ham trialist and played football at schoolboy level with a number of West Ham players such as Jim Barrett. Through this contrivance of association the club&#x27;s fans took it upon themselves to begin singing the popular music hall tune before home games, sometimes reinforced by the presence of a house band requested to play the refrain by Charlie Paynter.

The 1975 FA Cup version – which contains the original lyrics, and features vocals from the team&#x27;s then-current players – is always played before home games, with the home crowd joining in and carrying the song on after the music stops at the verse line &quot;Fortune&#x27;s always hiding&quot;. Bubbles was published as a waltz whereas during the game the crowd sing it in common time.

Since the 1950s, fans have also sung the East London pub song Knees Up Mother Brown. The song title is also the name of an internet forum related to the club.

Like other teams, the team also have a history of adopting or adapting popular songs of the day to fit particular events, themes, players or personas. These have included serious renditions of theatre and movie classics such as &quot;The Bells are Ringing&quot;, along with more pun-laden or humorous efforts, such as chanting former player Paolo Di Canio&#x27;s name to the canzone &quot;La donna è mobile&quot; by Giuseppe Verdi, or D.I. Canio to the tune of Ottawan&#x27;s &quot;D.I.S.C.O.&quot;, or the chant of &quot;Who Let The Potts Out?&quot; to the tune of Baha Men&#x27;s &quot;Who Let the Dogs Out?&quot; when Steve Potts could be seen warming up to come on as substitute late on in his career, or &quot;That&#x27;s Zamora&quot; to the tune of Dean Martin&#x27;s 1953 &quot;That&#x27;s Amore&quot; in honour of former striker Bobby Zamora. Other former players to be serenaded include Christian Dailly with vastly-altered lyrics to Frankie Valli&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Take My Eyes Off You&quot;, Joe Cole and Carlton Cole with Spandau Ballet&#x27;s &quot;Gold&quot; song title sung as &quot;Cole&quot; and Luděk Mikloško. A song for West Ham favourite Bobby Moore, &quot;Viva Bobby Moore&quot;, is also sung based on The Business&#x27;s &quot;Oi!&quot; rendition of the song, based on The Equals&#x27; 1969 release &quot;Viva Bobby Joe&quot;. In 2016, supporters adapted the lyrics of Billy Ray Cyrus&#x27; &quot;Achy Breaky Heart&quot; in honour of Dimitri Payet.

When the players come onto the pitch, and at other times of celebration, as the song &quot;I&#x27;m forever blowing bubbles&quot; is being sung, around 60 bubble machines produce copious bubbles that rise high into the stadium.
Fans gained national attention after giving a torrid time to David Beckham in his first away match of 1998–99 the season after the England midfielder was sent off for a petulant foul on Diego Simeone. Coinciding with the game, there were claims (and an image taken) that fans, organised by a hardcore, had hung an effigy of the player outside a local pub. Although it was later revealed that the pub was in South-East London, the heartland of West Ham&#x27;s greatest rivals Millwall. The West Ham fans did, however, boo Beckham&#x27;s every touch of the ball during the game.

They have also displayed a particular zeal when it comes to abusing former players, particularly those who are perceived to have abandoned the club or performed some disservice. Paul Ince, Frank Lampard, Jermain Defoe, Nigel Reo-Coker and Jesse Lingard have famously borne the brunt of verbal assaults and a guaranteed hostile reception at Upton Park. However, players such as Joe Cole, Michael Carrick, Rio Ferdinand, Bobby Zamora and Carlos Tevez receive applause and even standing ovations in honour of their contributions during their time at the club. Joe Cole subsequently rejoined West Ham from Liverpool midway through the 2012–13 season.

===Hooliganism===
The origins of West Ham&#x27;s links with hooliganism starts in the 1960s with the establishment of The Mile End Mob (named after an area of the East End of London). During the 1970s and 1980s (the main era for organised football-related violence), West Ham gained further notoriety for the levels of hooliganism in their fan base and antagonistic behaviour towards both their own and rival fans, and the police. During the 1970s in particular, rival groups of West Ham fans from neighbouring areas often did battle with each other at games, most often groups from the neighbouring districts of Barking and Dagenham.

The Inter City Firm were one of the first &quot;casuals&quot;, so called because they avoided police supervision by not wearing football-related clothing and travelled to away matches on regular InterCity trains, rather than on the cheap and more tightly policed &quot;football special&quot; charter trains. The group were an infamous West Ham-aligned gang. As the firm&#x27;s moniker &quot;inter city&quot; suggests violent activities were not confined to local derbies – the hooligans were content to cause trouble at any game, though nearby teams often bore the brunt.

Both the 1989 film &quot;The Firm&quot; (starring Gary Oldman), and the 2005 film &quot;Green Street&quot; (starring Elijah Wood and Charlie Hunnam) are based upon West Ham hooligan firms.

===Rivalries===

West Ham have strong rivalries with several other clubs. Most of these are with other London clubs, especially with Tottenham Hotspur in an East versus North London derby and with Chelsea in an East versus West London rivalry. The rivalry between West Ham and Tottenham has been fuelled by players such as Michael Carrick, Martin Peters, Paul Allen, Jermain Defoe and Scott Parker leaving the Hammers to join Tottenham. The rivalry deepened with the appointment of former Hammers manager Harry Redknapp as Tottenham&#x27;s manager. Since the 2006–07 Premier League season, West Ham have developed a strong rivalry with Yorkshire club Sheffield United due to the dubious circumstances surrounding the transfer of Carlos Tevez, who helped West Ham avoid relegation at Sheffield United&#x27;s expense.
The oldest and fiercest rivalry is with Millwall. The two sides are local rivals, having both been founded by employees of local companies, with players living in the same localities. The early history of both clubs are intertwined, with West Ham proving to be the more successful in a number of meetings between the two teams at the time, resulting in West Ham being promoted at the expense of Millwall. Millwall later declined to join the fledgling Football League while West Ham went on to the top division and an FA Cup final. Later in the 1920s, the rivalry was intensified during strike action which Isle of Dogs-based companies (i.e., Millwall fans) refused to support, breeding ill will between the two camps, the bitterness of this betrayal enduring for years. In 1972, a Millwall supporter died at New Cross station after falling out of a train during a fight with West Ham fans.

The rivalry between West Ham and Millwall has involved considerable violence and is one of the most notorious within the world of football hooliganism. The teams were drawn against each other in the second round of the 2009–10 League Cup and met on 25 August 2009 at Upton Park. This was the first time in four years that the two clubs had played each other, and the first ever in the League Cup. Clashes between fans occurred outside the ground, resulting in violence erupting up to half a mile away from the stadium, with serious injuries, including the stabbing of a Millwall supporter, damage to property and several arrests reported by police. There were also several pitch invasions by West Ham supporters which brought a temporary halt to the game. In January 2010, West Ham were fined after being found guilty of violent, threatening, obscene and provocative behaviour and of failing to prevent their fans entering the field of play. Millwall were cleared of all charges.

The team and supporters are known as The Hammers, in part because of the club&#x27;s origins as Thames Ironworks. They are also known as The Irons.

==Stadium==

Until 2016, West Ham were based at the Boleyn Ground, commonly known as Upton Park, in Newham, East London. The capacity of the Boleyn Ground was 35,016, and had been West Ham&#x27;s ground since 1904. Prior to this, in their previous incarnation of Thames Ironworks, they played at Hermit Road in Canning Town and briefly at Browning Road in East Ham, before moving to the Memorial Grounds in Plaistow in 1897. They retained the stadium during their transition to becoming West Ham United and were there for a further four seasons before moving to the Boleyn Ground in 1904.

Former chairman Eggert Magnússon made clear his ambition for West Ham to move to the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Summer Olympics, a desire reiterated by current chairmen Gold and Sullivan when they assumed control of the club stating that they felt it was a logical move for the government as it was in the borough of Newham.

In February 2010, however, the British Olympic Minister stated that West Ham would not get the stadium, and it would instead be used for track and field. On 17 May 2010, West Ham and Newham London Borough Council submitted a formal plan to the Olympic Park Legacy Company for the use of the Olympic Stadium following the 2012 Summer Olympics. The proposal was for a stadium with a capacity of 60,000 which would retain a competition athletics track. The proposal was welcomed by the chairman of UK athletics, Ed Warner, who said, &quot;I think it will feel great as a football stadium and I speak as a football fan as well the chairman of UK Athletics. I think you&#x27;d find West Ham would cover the track in the winter season so it wouldn&#x27;t look like you had a track between you and the pitch.&quot;

On 30 September 2010, the club formally submitted its bid for the Olympic Stadium with a presentation at 10 Downing Street, and on 8 October 2010 the world&#x27;s largest live entertainment company, Live Nation, endorsed the club&#x27;s Olympic Stadium plans. Three days after Live Nation&#x27;s backing, UK Athletics confirmed its formal support for West Ham United and Newham Council in their joint bid to take over the Olympic Stadium in legacy mode. In November 2010, West Ham began a search for potential developers for &quot;informal discussions&quot; about what would happen to the ground if it were to win its bid to take over the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games. According to the club, the site could be vacated and open to redevelopment by summer 2014. On 11 February 2011, the Olympic Park Legacy Committee selected West Ham as the preferred club to move into the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games.

The decision in favour of West Ham&#x27;s bid was unanimous, although controversial as local Premier League rivals Tottenham Hotspur had also been bidding for the venue. Hopes of moving to the stadium, however, were since placed under doubt following a legal challenge by Tottenham and Leyton Orient, with Leyton Orienta perennial (since 1980) tier 3 to tier 5 clubfearful that having West Ham playing less than a mile away from their Brisbane Road ground could steal support from the club and put them out of business. Both clubs&#x27; appeals for a judicial review, however, were rejected on 23 June 2011. On 3 March 2011, West Ham&#x27;s proposed move to the Olympic Stadium was formally approved by the British government and then-Mayor of London Boris Johnson.

On 8 June 2011, it was confirmed that the Westfield Shopping Centre had been in detailed talks with West Ham for naming rights of the new Olympic stadium which could be called the Westfield Stadium. West Ham announced plans to move from the Boleyn Ground from the 2014–15 season. In August 2011, an independent investigation initiated by the Olympic Park Legacy Company upheld the decision to award West Ham the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games. On 29 June 2011, however, Tottenham announced that they were returning to the High Court again to fight the decision to award West Ham the stadium, in an oral hearing, to try to overturn the original High Court appeal being rejected. On 25 August 2011, Tottenham and Leyton Orient were in fact granted a judicial review by the High Court into the Olympic Stadium bidding process. On 11 October 2011, the deal to award West Ham the Olympic Stadium collapsed over concerns of legal pressure, with the government deciding that the stadium will stay in public ownership. Six days later, Tottenham and Leyton Orient announced they had ended their legal challenge after the deal collapsed.

Once the original deal collapsed, a new process to select a tenant was begun. West Ham immediately announced plans to become tenants of the stadium. By March 2012, West Ham was one of the four bidders for the stadium. With a decision due by the Olympic Park Legacy Company in May 2012, Mayor of London Boris Johnson delayed the final selection of future tenants until completion of the 2012 Summer Olympics, stating that it was &quot;overwhelmingly likely&quot; that the tenants would be West Ham.

It was announced on 22 March 2013 that West Ham had signed a 99-year lease for the Olympic Stadium after the government agreed to put in an extra £1 million towards the costs of converting the site. The club&#x27;s plan was to move into the stadium prior to the start of the 2016–17 season. Supporters of rival clubs had pressed for an inquiry into the granting of West Ham&#x27;s tenancy, arguing that West Ham were being given an unfair advantage by the arrangement. In September 2015, however, the government rejected holding such an inquiry.

==The Academy of Football==
The club promotes the popular idea of West Ham being &quot;The Academy of Football&quot;, with the moniker adorning the ground&#x27;s new stadium façade. The comment predominantly refers to the club&#x27;s youth development system which was established by manager Ted Fenton during the 1950s, that has seen a number of international players emerge through the ranks. Most notably, the club contributed three players to the World Cup-winning England side of 1966, including club icon Bobby Moore, as well as Martin Peters and Geoff Hurst who between them scored all of England&#x27;s goals in the eventual 4–2 victory. Other academy players that have gone on to play for England have included Trevor Brooking, Alvin Martin, Tony Cottee, Paul Ince, and Declan Rice.

Since the late 1990s, Rio Ferdinand, Frank Lampard, Joe Cole, Michael Carrick and Glen Johnson began their careers at West Ham and all went on to play for other clubs. Most recently, the likes of first teamers Mark Noble and James Tomkins, as well as Welsh international Jack Collison, have emerged through the . Frustratingly for fans and managers alike, the club has struggled to retain many of these players due to (predominantly) financial reasons. West Ham, during the 2007–08 season, had an average of 6.61 English players in the starting line up, higher than any other Premier League club, which cemented their status as one of the few Premier League clubs left that were recognised to be bringing through young English talent and were recognised as having &quot;homegrown players&quot;. Between 2000 and 2011, the club produced eight England players, as many as Manchester United and one fewer than Arsenal. Much of the success of the academy has been attributed to Tony Carr, who was West Ham youth coach between 1973 and 2014.

===West Ham dream team===

In the 2003 book &quot;The Official West Ham United Dream Team&quot;, 500 fans were quizzed for who would be in their all time Hammers Eleven. The voting was restricted to players from the modern era.


===Hammer of the Year===
The following is a list of recipients of the &#x27;Hammer of the Year&#x27; award. The first award, to Andy Malcolm in 1957–58, was nominated by a journalist at &quot;The Stratford Express&quot;. Subsequent recipients would be awarded the title after a vote by supporters. Trevor Brooking was the first player for West Ham United to have been honoured with the title of Hammer of the Year three times in a row in 1976, 1977 and 1978. Scott Parker repeated this feat between 2009 and 2011. Brooking has won the award the most times, on five occasions: 1972, 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1984. Bobby Moore, Billy Bonds and Julian Dicks have each won it four times.

Bobby Moore has been runner-up four times, while Billy Bonds and Tony Cottee have both been runners-up three times.

Billy Bonds and Trevor Brooking&#x27;s wins are notable in the amount of time between first and last Hammer of the Year award. Bonds has 16 years separating his wins whilst Brooking has 12.

===Lifetime Achievement Award===
In 2013, West Ham United introduced a new annual award, the West Ham United Lifetime Achievement Award.

The first award was presented to club-record appearance maker Billy Bonds, who picked up the award on the pitch at Upton Park before kick-off against Cardiff City on the opening day of the 2013–14 season.

The 2014 award was presented to Sir Trevor Brooking, a record five-time winner of the Hammer of the Year award. Brooking received the award before the 2014–15 season curtain-raiser against Tottenham Hotspur on 16 August 2014. Brooking had already had the Centenary Stand at the Boleyn ground named after him in 2009.

The 2015 award was awarded to Martin Peters.

On 3 May 2016, it was announced via the club&#x27;s official website that the fourth recipient of the award would be Sir Geoff Hurst, the club&#x27;s second all-time leading goalscorer, and scorer of a hat-trick in the 1966 World Cup Final. Hurst would be honoured at the club&#x27;s 2015/16 Player Awards Ceremony. Ken Brown became the sixth recipient of the award, in April 2018. The 2019 honour was awarded to midfielder Ronnie Boyce who made his debut for West Ham in 1960.

===Mark Noble Young Hammer of the Year Award===
In honour of Mark Noble, who was also the award winner in 2004, and had been serving the club since 2000 and retired in 2022, the Young Hammer of the Year award was renamed to Mark Noble Young Hammer of the Year Award on 9 May 2022.

==Managers==
West Ham United have had 19 permanent managers in their history and an additional three caretaker managers.

==Ownership and chairmen==
In January 2010, David Sullivan and David Gold acquired a 50% share in West Ham, given them overall operational and commercial control. At the end of May 2010, Gold and Sullivan purchased a further 10% stake in the club at a cost of £8 million. Taking their controlling stake to 60%, they announced that they could open up shares for fans to purchase. On 9 August 2010, Gold and Sullivan increased their shares up to 30.6% each with &quot;minority investors&quot;, (which included former owner Terry Brown, purchasing a further 3.8% of the club at a cost of around −4 million) leaving Icelandic Straumur Investment Bank owning 35% of the club.

On 2 July 2013, Sullivan acquired a further 25% of shares after restructuring the debt of the club, leaving Straumur Bank with just 10%. In order to clear club debts before a move to the Olympic Stadium in 2016, in December 2014 Sullivan announced the availability for sale of 20% of the club. The clearing of club debts, given in July 2013 as £70 million, was given as a pre-condition to a move to the Olympic Stadium.

In September 2017, American billionaire J. Albert &quot;Tripp&quot; Smith, senior management director of Blackstone Inc., bought 10% of the shares of the club. On 10 November 2021, the club announced Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský had acquired 27% of the shares of the club, reducing Gold and Sullivan&#x27;s shares.

Co-chairman David Gold died on 4 January 2023, leaving Sullivan as the sole chairman. Seven months later, Gold&#x27;s daughter Vanessa became joint-chair with Sullivan.

<text>The substantia nigra (SN) is a basal ganglia structure located in the midbrain that plays an important role in reward and movement. &quot;Substantia nigra&quot; is Latin for &quot;black substance&quot;, reflecting the fact that parts of the substantia nigra appear darker than neighboring areas due to high levels of neuromelanin in dopaminergic neurons. Parkinson&#x27;s disease is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta.

Although the substantia nigra appears as a continuous band in brain sections, anatomical studies have found that it actually consists of two parts with very different connections and functions: the pars compacta (SNpc) and the pars reticulata (SNpr). The pars compacta serves mainly as a projection to the basal ganglia circuit, supplying the striatum with dopamine. The pars reticulata conveys signals from the basal ganglia to numerous other brain structures.

== Structure ==

The substantia nigra, along with four other nuclei, is part of the basal ganglia. It is the largest nucleus in the midbrain, lying dorsal to the cerebral peduncles. Humans have two substantiae nigrae, one on each side of the midline.

The SN is divided into two parts: the pars reticulata (SNpr) and the pars compacta (SNpc), which lies medial to the pars reticulata. Sometimes, a third region, the pars lateralis, is mentioned, though it is usually classified as part of the pars reticulata. The (SNpr) and the internal globus pallidus (GPi) are separated by the internal capsule.

===Pars reticulata===

The pars reticulata bears a strong structural and functional resemblance to the internal part of the globus pallidus. The two are sometimes considered parts of the same structure, separated by the white matter of the internal capsule. Like those of the globus pallidus, the neurons in pars reticulata are mainly GABAergic.

====Afferent connections====
The main input to the SNpr derives from the striatum. It comes by two routes, known as the direct and indirect pathways. The direct pathway consists of axons from medium spiny cells in the striatum that project directly to pars reticulata. The indirect pathway consists of three links: a projection from striatal medium spiny cells to the external part of the globus pallidus; a GABAergic projection from the globus pallidus to the subthalamic nucleus, and a glutamatergic projection from the subthalamic nucleus to the pars reticulata. Thus, striatal activity via the direct pathway exerts an inhibitory effect on neurons in the (SNpr) but an excitatory effect via the indirect pathway. The direct and indirect pathways originate from different subsets of striatal medium spiny cells: They are tightly intermingled, but express different types of dopamine receptors, as well as showing other neurochemical differences.

====Efferent connections====
Significant projections occur to the thalamus (ventral lateral and ventral anterior nuclei), superior colliculus, and other caudal nuclei from the pars reticulata (the nigrothalamic pathway), which use GABA as their neurotransmitter. In addition, these neurons form up to five collaterals that branch within both the pars compacta and pars reticulata, likely modulating dopaminergic activity in the pars compacta.

== Function ==
The substantia nigra is an important player in brain function, in particular, in eye movement, motor planning, reward-seeking, learning, and addiction. Many of the substantia nigra&#x27;s effects are mediated through the striatum. The nigral dopaminergic input to the striatum via the nigrostriatal pathway is intimately linked with the striatum&#x27;s function. The co-dependence between the striatum and substantia nigra can be seen in this way: when the substantia nigra is electrically stimulated, no movement occurs; however, the symptoms of nigral degeneration due to Parkinson&#x27;s is a poignant example of the substantia nigra&#x27;s influence on movement. In addition to striatum-mediated functions, the substantia nigra also serves as a major source of GABAergic inhibition to various brain targets.

===Pars reticulata===

The pars reticulata of the substantia nigra is an important processing center in the basal ganglia. The GABAergic neurons in the pars reticulata convey the final processed signals of the basal ganglia to the thalamus and superior colliculus. In addition, the pars reticulata also inhibits dopaminergic activity in the pars compacta via axon collaterals, although the functional organization of these connections remains unclear.

The GABAergic neurons of the pars reticulata spontaneously fire action potentials. In rats, the frequency of action potentials is roughly 25 Hz. The purpose of these spontaneous action potentials is to inhibit targets of the basal ganglia, and decreases in inhibition are associated with movement. The subthalamic nucleus gives excitatory input that modulates the rate of firing of these spontaneous action potentials. However, lesion of the subthalamic nucleus leads to only a 20% decrease in pars reticulata firing rate, suggesting that the generation of action potentials in the pars reticulata is largely autonomous, as exemplified by the pars reticulata&#x27;s role in saccadic eye movement. A group of GABAergic neurons from the pars reticulata projects to the superior colliculus, exhibiting a high level of sustained inhibitory activity. Projections from the caudate nucleus to the superior colliculus also modulate saccadic eye movement.
Altered patterns of pars reticulata firing such as single-spike or burst firing are found in Parkinson&#x27;s disease and epilepsy.

===Pars compacta===

The most prominent function of the pars compacta is motor control, though the substantia nigra&#x27;s role in motor control is indirect; electrical stimulation of the substantia nigra does not result in movement, due to mediation of the striatum in the nigral influence of movement. The pars compacta sends excitatory input to the striatum via D1 pathway that excites and activates the striatum, resulting in the release of GABA onto the globus pallidus to inhibit its inhibitory effects on the thalamic nucleus. This causes the thalamocortical pathways to become excited and transmits motor neuron signals to the cerebral cortex to allow the initiation of movement, which is absent in Parkinson&#x27;s disease. However, lack of pars compacta neurons has a large influence on movement, as evidenced by the symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s. The motor role of the pars compacta may involve fine motor control, as has been confirmed in animal models with lesions in that region.

The pars compacta is heavily involved in learned responses to stimuli. In primates, dopaminergic neuron activity increases in the nigrostriatal pathway when a new stimulus is presented. Dopaminergic activity decreases with repeated stimulus presentation. However, behaviorally significant stimulus presentation (i.e. rewards) continues to activate dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Dopaminergic projections from the ventral tegmental area (bottom part of the &quot;midbrain&quot; or mesencephalon) to the prefrontal cortex (mesocortical pathway) and to the nucleus accumbens (mesolimbic pathway – &quot;meso&quot; referring to &quot;from the mesencephalon&quot;... specifically the ventral tegmental area) are implicated in reward, pleasure, and addictive behavior. The pars compacta is also important in spatial learning, the observations about one&#x27;s environment and location in space. Lesions in the pars compacta lead to learning deficits in repeating identical movements, and some studies point to its involvement in a dorsal striatal-dependent, response-based memory system that functions relatively independent of the hippocampus, which is traditionally believed to subserve spatial or episodic-like memory functions.

The pars compacta also plays a role in temporal processing and is activated during time reproduction. Lesions in the pars compacta leads to temporal deficits. As of late, the pars compacta has been suspected of regulating the sleep-wake cycle, which is consistent with symptoms such as insomnia and REM sleep disturbances that are reported by patients with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Even so, partial dopamine deficits that do not affect motor control can lead to disturbances in the sleep-wake cycle, especially REM-like patterns of neural activity while awake, especially in the hippocampus.

==Clinical significance==
The substantia nigra is critical in the development of many diseases and syndromes, including parkinsonism and Parkinson&#x27;s disease. There exists a study showing that high-frequency stimulation delivery to the left substantia nigra can induce transient acute depression symptoms.

===Parkinson&#x27;s disease===
Parkinson&#x27;s disease is a neurodegenerative disease characterized, in part, by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc. The major symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease include tremor, akinesia, bradykinesia, and stiffness. Other symptoms include disturbances to posture, fatigue, sleep abnormalities, and depressed mood.

The cause of death of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc is unknown. However, some contributions to the unique susceptibility of dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta have been identified. For one, dopaminergic neurons show abnormalities in mitochondrial complex 1, causing aggregation of alpha-synuclein; this can result in abnormal protein handling and neuron death. Secondly, dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta contain less calbindin than other dopaminergic neurons. Calbindin is a protein involved in calcium ion transport within cells, and excess calcium in cells is toxic. The calbindin theory would explain the high cytotoxicity of Parkinson&#x27;s in the substantia nigra compared to the ventral tegmental area. Regardless of the cause of neuronal death, the plasticity of the pars compacta is very robust; Parkinsonian symptoms do not generally appear until at least 30% of pars compacta dopaminergic neurons have died. Most of this plasticity occurs at the neurochemical level; dopamine transport systems are slowed, allowing dopamine to linger for longer periods of time in the chemical synapses in the striatum.

Menke, Jbabdi, Miller, Matthews and Zari (2010) used diffusion tensor imaging, as well as T1 mapping to assess volumetric differences in the SNpc and SNpr, in participants with Parkinson&#x27;s compared to healthy individuals. These researchers found that participants with Parkinson&#x27;s consistently had a smaller substantia nigra, specifically in the SNpr. Because the SNpr is connected to the posterior thalamus, ventral thalamus and specifically, the motor cortex, and because participants with Parkinson&#x27;s disease report having a smaller SNprs (Menke, Jbabdi, Miller, Matthews and Zari, 2010), the small volume of this region may be responsible for motor impairments found in Parkinson&#x27;s disease patients. This small volume may be responsible for weaker and/or less controlled motor movements, which may result in the tremors often experienced by those with Parkinson&#x27;s.

Oxidative stress and oxidative damage in the SNpc are likely key drivers in the etiology of Parkinson&#x27;s disease as individuals age. DNA damages caused by oxidative stress can be repaired by processes modulated by alpha-synuclein. Alpha synuclein is expressed in the substantia nigra, but its DNA repair function appears to be compromised in Lewy body inclusion bearing neurons. This loss may trigger cell death.

===Schizophrenia===

Increased levels of dopamine have long been implicated in the development of schizophrenia. However, much debate continues to this day surrounding this dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia. Despite the controversy, dopamine antagonists remain a standard and successful treatment for schizophrenia. These antagonists include first generation (typical) antipsychotics such as butyrophenones, phenothiazines, and thioxanthenes. These drugs have largely been replaced by second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics such as clozapine and paliperidone. In general, these drugs do not act on dopamine-producing neurons themselves, but on the receptors on the post-synaptic neuron.

Other, non-pharmacological evidence in support of the dopamine hypothesis relating to the substantia nigra include structural changes in the pars compacta, such as reduction in synaptic terminal size. Other changes in the substantia nigra include increased expression of NMDA receptors in the substantia nigra, and reduced dysbindin expression. Increased NMDA receptors may point to the involvement of glutamate-dopamine interactions in schizophrenia. Dysbindin, which has been (controversially) linked to schizophrenia, may regulate dopamine release, and low expression of dysbindin in the substantia nigra may be important in schizophrenia etiology. Due to the changes to the substantia nigra in the schizophrenic brain, it may eventually be possible to use specific imaging techniques (such as neuromelanin-specific imaging) to detect physiological signs of schizophrenia in the substantia nigra.

=== Wooden Chest Syndrome ===
Wooden chest, also called fentanyl chest wall rigidity syndrome, is a rare side effect of synthetic opioids such as Fentanyl, Sulfentanil, Alfentanil, Remifentanil. It results in a generalised increase in skeletal muscle tone. The mechanism is thought to be via increased dopamine release and decreased GABA release in the nerves of the substantia nigra/striatum. The effect is most pronounced on the chest wall muscles and can lead to impaired ventilation. The condition is most commonly observed in anaesthesia where rapid and high doses of these drugs are given intravenously. 

===Multiple system atrophy===
Multiple system atrophy characterized by neuronal degeneration in the striatum and substantia nigra was previously called &quot;striatonigral degeneration&quot;.

==Chemical modification of the substantia nigra==
Chemical manipulation and modification of the substantia nigra is important in the fields of neuropharmacology and toxicology. Various compounds such as levodopa and MPTP are used in the treatment and study of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and many other drugs have effects on the substantia nigra.

===Amphetamine and trace amines===

Studies have shown that, in certain brain regions, amphetamine and trace amines increase the concentrations of dopamine in the synaptic cleft, thereby heightening the response of the post-synaptic neuron. The various mechanisms by which amphetamine and trace amines affect dopamine concentrations have been studied extensively, and are known to involve both DAT and VMAT2. Amphetamine is similar in structure to dopamine and trace amines; as a consequence, it can enter the presynaptic neuron via as well as by diffusing through the neural membrane directly. Upon entering the presynaptic neuron, amphetamine and trace amines activate TAAR1, which, through protein kinase signaling, induces dopamine efflux, phosphorylation-dependent internalization, and non-competitive reuptake inhibition. Because of the similarity between amphetamine and trace amines, it is also a substrate for monoamine transporters; as a consequence, it (competitively) inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and other monoamines by competing with them for uptake, as well.

In addition, amphetamine and trace amines are substrates for the neuronal vesicular monoamine transporter, vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). When amphetamine is taken up by , the vesicle releases (effluxes) dopamine molecules into the cytosol in exchange.

===Cocaine===

Cocaine&#x27;s mechanism of action in the human brain includes the inhibition of dopamine reuptake, which accounts for cocaine&#x27;s addictive properties, as dopamine is the critical neurotransmitter for reward. However, cocaine is more active in the dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area than the substantia nigra. Cocaine administration increases metabolism in the substantia nigra, which can explain the altered motor function seen in cocaine-using subjects. The inhibition of dopamine reuptake by cocaine also inhibits the firing of spontaneous action potentials by the pars compacta. The mechanism by which cocaine inhibits dopamine reuptake involves its binding to the dopamine transporter protein. However, studies show that cocaine can also cause a decrease in DAT mRNA levels, most likely due to cocaine blocking dopamine receptors rather than direct interference with transcriptional or translational pathways.

Inactivation of the substantia nigra could prove to be a possible treatment for cocaine addiction. In a study of cocaine-dependent rats, inactivation of the substantia nigra via implanted cannulae greatly reduced cocaine addiction relapse.

===Levodopa===

The substantia nigra is the target of chemical therapeutics for the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Levodopa (commonly referred to as L-DOPA), the dopamine precursor, is the most commonly prescribed medication for Parkinson&#x27;s disease, despite controversy concerning the neurotoxicity of dopamine and L-DOPA. The drug is especially effective in treating patients in the early stages of Parkinson&#x27;s, although it does lose its efficacy over time. Levodopa can cross the blood–brain barrier and increases dopamine levels in the substantia nigra, thus alleviating the symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. The drawback of levodopa treatment is that it treats the symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s (low dopamine levels), rather than the cause (the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra).

===MPTP===

MPTP, is a neurotoxin specific to dopaminergic cells in the brain, specifically in the substantia nigra. MPTP was brought to the spotlight in 1982 when heroin users in California displayed Parkinson&#x27;s-like symptoms after using MPPP contaminated with MPTP. The patients, who were rigid and almost completely immobile, responded to levodopa treatment. No remission of the Parkinson&#x27;s-like symptoms was reported, suggesting irreversible death of the dopaminergic neurons. The proposed mechanism of MPTP involves disruption of mitochondrial function, including disruption of metabolism and creation of free radicals.

Soon after, MPTP was tested in animal models for its efficacy in inducing Parkinson&#x27;s disease (with success). MPTP induced akinesia, rigidity, and tremor in primates, and its neurotoxicity was found to be very specific to the substantia nigra pars compacta. In other animals, such as rodents, the induction of Parkinson&#x27;s by MPTP is incomplete or requires much higher and frequent doses than in primates. Today, MPTP remains the most favored method to induce Parkinson&#x27;s disease in animal models.

==History==
The substantia nigra was discovered in 1784 by Félix Vicq-d&#x27;Azyr, and Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring alluded to this structure in 1791. The differentiation between the substantia nigra pars reticulata and compacta was first proposed by Sano in 1910. In 1963, Oleh Hornykiewicz concluded from his observation that &quot;cell loss in the substantia nigra (of Parkinson&#x27;s disease patients) could well be the cause of the dopamine deficit in the striatum.&quot;

<text>Basil II [[Porphyrogenitus]] ( ; 958 – 15 December 1025), nicknamed the Bulgar Slayer (, ), was the senior Byzantine emperor from 976 to 1025. He and his brother Constantine VIII were crowned before their father Romanos II died in 963, but they were too young to rule. The throne thus went to two generals, Nikephoros Phokas (963–969) and John Tzimiskes (r. 969–976) before Basil became senior emperor, though his influential great-uncle Basil Lekapenos remained as the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler until 985. His reign of 49 years and 11 months was the longest of any Roman emperor.

The early years of Basil&#x27;s reign were dominated by civil wars against two powerful generals from the Byzantine Anatolian aristocracy: first Bardas Skleros and later Bardas Phokas, which ended shortly after Phokas&#x27; death and Skleros&#x27; submission in 989. Basil then oversaw the stabilization and expansion of the eastern frontier of the Byzantine Empire and the complete subjugation of the First Bulgarian Empire, its foremost European foe, after a long struggle. Although the Byzantines had made a truce with the Fatimid Caliphate in 987–988, Basil led a campaign against the Caliphate that ended with another truce in 1000. He also conducted a campaign against the Khazar Khaganate that gained the Byzantine Empire part of Crimea and a series of successful campaigns against the Kingdom of Georgia.

Despite near-constant warfare, Basil distinguished himself as an administrator, reducing the power of the great land-owning families who dominated the Empire&#x27;s administration and military, filling its treasury, and leaving it with its greatest expanse in four centuries. Although his successors were largely incapable rulers, the Empire flourished for decades after Basil&#x27;s death. One of the most important decisions taken during his reign was to offer the hand of his sister Anna Porphyrogenita to Vladimir I of Kiev in exchange for military support, thus forming the Byzantine military unit known as the Varangian Guard. The marriage of Anna and Vladimir led to the Christianization of the Kievan Rus&#x27; and the incorporation of later successor states of Kievan Rus&#x27; within the Byzantine cultural and religious tradition. Basil is seen as a Greek national hero but is a despised figure among Bulgarians.

==Physical appearance and personality==
The courtier and historian Michael Psellos, who was born towards the end of Basil&#x27;s reign, gives a description of Basil in his &quot;Chronographia&quot;. Psellos describes him as a stocky man of shorter-than-average stature who nevertheless was an impressive figure on horseback. He had light-blue eyes, strongly arched eyebrows, luxuriant side whiskers—which he had a habit of rolling between his fingers when deep in thought or angry—and in later life a scant beard. Psellos also states that Basil was not an articulate speaker and had a loud laugh that convulsed his whole frame. Basil is described as having ascetic tastes and caring little for the pomp and ceremony of the Imperial court, typically wearing a sombre, dark-purple robe furnished with few of the gems that usually decorated imperial costumes. He is also described as a capable administrator who left a well-stocked treasury upon his death. Basil supposedly despised literary culture and affected scorn for the learned classes of Byzantium.

According to the 19th century historian George Finlay, Basil saw himself as &quot;prudent, just, and devout; others considered him severe, rapacious, cruel, and bigoted. For Greek learning he cared little, and he was a type of the higher Byzantine moral character, which retained far more of its Roman than its Greek origin&quot;. The modern historian John Julius Norwich wrote of Basil: &quot;No lonelier man ever occupied the Byzantine throne. And it is hardly surprising: Basil was ugly, dirty, coarse, boorish, and almost pathologically mean. He was in short deeply un-Byzantine. He cared only for the greatness of his Empire. No wonder that in his hands it reached its apogee&quot;.

==Early life and rule (960-976)==
Basil II was born in 958. He was a &quot;porphyrogennetos&quot; (&quot;born into the purple&quot;), as were his father Romanos II and his grandfather Constantine VII; this was the appellation used for children who were born to a reigning emperor. Basil was the eldest son of Romanos and his Laconian Greek second wife Theophano, who was the daughter of a poor tavern-keeper named Krateros and may have originated from the city of Sparta. He may have had an elder sister named Helena (born 955). Romanos succeeded Constantine VII as sole emperor upon the latter&#x27;s death in 959. Basil&#x27;s father crowned him as co-emperor on 22 April 960, and his brother Constantine (born 960 or 961, eventually to rule as sole emperor Constantine VIII in 1025–1028) in 962 or 963. Only two days after the birth of his youngest child Anna, Romanos II died on 15 March 963 at 24 years of age. His unexpected death was commonly thought at the time to be the result of poisoning with hemlock; the chroniclers Leo the Deacon and John Skylitzes imply that Theophano was responsible, and according to Skylitzes, she had been complicit in an earlier attempt by Romanos II to poison Constantine VII.

Basil and Constantine were too young to rule in their own right when Romanos died in 963. Therefore, although the Byzantine Senate confirmed them as emperors with their mother as the nominal regent, &quot;de facto&quot; power passed for the time into the hands of the &quot;parakoimomenos&quot; Joseph Bringas. Theophano did not trust Bringas, however, and another enemy of the powerful &quot;parakoimomenos&quot; was Basil Lekapenos, an illegitimate, eunuch son of Emperor Romanos I – Basil&#x27;s great-grandfather. Lekapenos himself had been &quot;parakoimomenos&quot; to Constantine VII and &quot;megas baioulos&quot; to Romanos II. Yet another enemy of Bringas was the successful and widely popular general Nikephoros Phokas, who had just returned from his conquest of the Emirate of Crete and a highly successful raid into Cilicia and Syria, which culminated in the sack of Aleppo. Phokas was proclaimed emperor by his men in July and marched on Constantinople. Bringas tried to bring in troops to stop his rival&#x27;s advance, but the capital&#x27;s populace supported Nikephoros. Bringas fled, leaving his post to Lekapenos, and on 16 August 963 Nikephoros Phokas was crowned emperor.

On 20 September, Phokas married Theophano, but problems resulted; it was a second marriage for each spouse and Nikephoros was thought to be the godfather of one or both of Theophano&#x27;s sons. Although Polyeuctus, the patriarch of Constantinople, disapproved of the marriage, the Church declared it to be valid. With it, Nikephoros secured his legitimacy and became the guardian of Basil and Constantine. He was murdered in December 969 by Theophano and his nephew John Tzimiskes, who then became emperor John I and exiled Theophano. John married Theodora, a sister of Romanos II. Basil II acceded to the throne as effective ruler and senior emperor when John died on 10 January 976. He immediately had his mother brought back from her convent.

== Sole emperor (976-1025) ==
===Rebellions in Anatolia and alliance with Rus&#x27;===

Basil was a very successful soldier on horseback and through his achievement he proved himself to be an able general and a strong ruler. In the early years of his reign, administration remained in the hands of Basil Lekapenos. As president of the Byzantine Senate, Lekapenos was a wily, gifted politician who hoped the young emperors would be his puppets. The younger Basil waited and watched without interfering, devoting himself to learning the details of administrative business and military science. 
Nikephoros II and John I were brilliant military commanders but proved to be poor administrators. Towards the end of his reign, John had belatedly planned to curb the power of the great landowners; his death, which occurred soon after he spoke out against them, led to rumors that he had been poisoned by Lekapenos, who had illegally acquired vast estates and feared an investigation and punishment. At the start of his reign, the failures of his immediate predecessors left Basil II with a serious problem: Bardas Skleros and Bardas Phokas, members of the wealthy military elite of Anatolia, had sufficient means to undertake open rebellion against his authority.

Skleros and Phokas, both of whom were experienced generals, wanted to assume the Imperial position that Nikephoros II and John I had held, and thus return Basil to the role of impotent cypher. Basil, showing a penchant for ruthlessness, took to the field himself and suppressed the rebellions of both Skleros (979) and Phokas (989) with the help of 12,000 Georgians of Tornikios and David III Kuropalates of Tao. The fall of Lekapenos occurred between the rebellions in 985; he was accused of plotting with the rebels and was punished with exile and the confiscation of his property.

The relationship between the two generals was complicated; Phokas was instrumental in defeating the rebellion of Skleros but when Phokas later rebelled, Skleros returned from exile to support him. When Phokas died in battle, Skleros, whom Phokas had imprisoned, assumed the leadership of the rebellion. Basil&#x27;s brother Constantine—who had no interest in politics, statecraft, or the military–led troops alongside Basil; this was the only military command Constantine would hold. The campaign ended without combat when Skleros was forced to surrender to Basil in 989. Skleros was allowed to live but he died blind, either through disease or from being blinded as punishment for his insurrection.

These rebellions had a profound effect on Basil&#x27;s outlook and methods of governance. Psellos describes the defeated Skleros giving Basil the following advice, which he took to heart: &quot;Cut down the governors who become over-proud. Let no generals on campaign have too many resources. Exhaust them with unjust exactions, to keep them busied with their own affairs. Admit no woman to the imperial councils. Be accessible to no-one. Share with few your most intimate plans.&quot;

To defeat these dangerous revolts, Basil formed an alliance with Prince Vladimir I of Kiev, who in 988 had captured Chersonesos, the Empire&#x27;s main base in the Crimean Peninsula. Vladimir offered to evacuate Chersonesos and to supply 6,000 of his soldiers as reinforcements to Basil. In exchange, he demanded to be married to Basil&#x27;s younger sister Anna. At first, Basil hesitated. The Byzantines viewed all of the peoples of Northern Europe—namely Franks and Slavs—as barbarians. Anna objected to marrying a barbarian ruler because such a marriage would have no precedent in Imperial annals.

Vladimir had researched various religions, having sent delegates to various countries. Marriage was not his main reason for choosing Christianity. When Vladimir promised to baptize himself and to convert his people to Christianity, Basil finally agreed. Vladimir and Anna were married in Crimea in 989. The Rus&#x27; warriors taken into Basil&#x27;s army were instrumental in ending the rebellion; they were later organized into the Varangian Guard. This marriage had important long-term implications, marking the beginning of the process by which the Grand Duchy of Moscow many centuries later would proclaim itself &quot;The Third Rome&quot;, and claim the political and cultural heritage of the Byzantine Empire.

===Campaigns against the Fatimid Caliphate===
Once the internal strife was quelled, Basil turned his attention to the Empire&#x27;s other enemies. The Byzantine civil wars had weakened the Empire&#x27;s position in the east, and the gains of Nikephoros II and John I had nearly been lost to the Fatimid Caliphate. In 987–988, a seven-year truce with the Fatimids was signed; it stipulated an exchange of prisoners, the recognition of the Byzantine emperor as protector of Christians under Fatimid rule and of the Fatimid Caliph as protector of Muslims under Byzantine rule, and the replacement of the name of the Abbasid caliph with that of the Fatimid caliph in the Friday prayer in the mosque at Constantinople. This lasted until the long-time vizier Yaqub ibn Killis died in 991. Fatimid caliph Al-Aziz Billah chose to pursue a more aggressive stance in Syria and appointed Manjutakin as governor of Damascus.

===Manjutakin&#x27;s attacks, and Basil&#x27;s first expedition to Syria===
Encouraged by the defectors after the death of emir Sa&#x27;d al-Dawla, Al-Aziz decided to renew his attacks on the Hamdanid Emirate of Aleppo, a Byzantine protectorate, perhaps expecting Basil would not interfere. Manjutakin invaded the emirate, defeated a Byzantine force under the &quot;doux&quot; of Antioch Michael Bourtzes in June 992, and laid siege to Aleppo. The city easily resisted. In early 993, after thirteen months of campaigning, a lack of supplies forced Manjutakin to return to Damascus.

In 994, Manjutakin resumed his offensive and in September scored a major victory at the Battle of the Orontes against Bourtzes. Bourtzes&#x27; defeat forced Basil to intervene personally in the East; with his army, he rode through Asia Minor to Aleppo in sixteen days, arriving in April 995. Basil&#x27;s sudden arrival and the exaggeration of his army&#x27;s strength circulating in the Fatimid camp caused panic in the Fatimid army, especially because Manjutakin, expecting no threat, had ordered his cavalry horses to be dispersed around the city for pasture. Despite having a considerably larger and well-rested army, Manjutakin was at a disadvantage. He burned his camp and retreated to Damascus without battle. The Byzantines besieged Tripoli unsuccessfully and occupied Tartus, which they refortified and garrisoned with Armenian troops. Al-Aziz now prepared to take to the field in person against the Byzantines and initiated large-scale preparations but they were abandoned upon his death.

====Second expedition to Syria, and peace====
Warfare between the two powers continued as the Byzantines supported an anti-Fatimid uprising in Tyre. In 998, the Byzantines under Damian Dalassenos, the successor of Bourtzes, launched an attack on Apamea but the Fatimid general Jaysh ibn al-Samsama defeated them in battle on 19 July 998. This defeat drew Basil back into the conflict; he arrived in Syria in October 999 and remained there for three months. Basil&#x27;s troops raided as far as Heliopolis, placed a garrison at Larissa, and burnt three minor forts in the vicinity of Abu Qubais, Masyath and Arca. The siege of Tripoli in December failed while Emesa was not threatened. Basil&#x27;s attention was diverted to developments in Georgia following the murder of David III Kuropalates; he departed for Cilicia in January and dispatched another embassy to Cairo.

In 1000, a ten-year truce was concluded between the two states. For the remainder of the reign of Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah ( 996–1021), relations remained peaceful as al-Hakim was more interested in internal affairs. Even the acknowledgement of Fatimid suzerainty by Abu Muhammad Lu&#x27;lu&#x27; al-Kabir of Aleppo in 1004 and the Fatimid-sponsored installment of Aziz al-Dawla as the city&#x27;s emir in 1017 did not lead to a resumption of hostilities, especially because al-Kabir continued to pay tribute to the Byzantines and al-Dawla quickly began acting as an independent ruler. Al-Hakim&#x27;s persecution of Christians in his realm and especially the 1009 destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at his orders strained relations and, along with Fatimid interference in Aleppo, provided the main focus of Fatimid–Byzantine diplomatic relations until the late 1030s.

===Conquest of Bulgaria===
Basil sought to restore former territories of the Byzantine Empire. At the start of the second millennium, he fought Samuel of Bulgaria, his greatest adversary. Bulgaria had been partly subjugated by John I after the invasion of Svyatoslav I of Kiev but parts of the country had remained outside Byzantine control under the leadership of Samuel and his brothers.

Because the Bulgars had been raiding Byzantine lands since 976, the Byzantine government sought to cause dissension among them by allowing the escape of their captive emperor Boris II of Bulgaria. This ploy failed so Basil used a respite from his conflict with the nobility to lead a 30,000-strong army into Bulgaria and besiege Sredets (Sofia) in 986. Taking losses and worried about the loyalty of some of his governors, Basil lifted the siege and returned for Thrace but he fell into an ambush and suffered a serious defeat at the Battle of the Gates of Trajan. Basil escaped with the help of his Varangian Guard and attempted to recover his losses by turning Samuel&#x27;s brother Aron against him. Aron was tempted by Basil&#x27;s offer of his sister Anna in marriage, but the negotiations failed when Aron discovered the bride he was sent was an imposter. By 987, Samuel had eliminated Aron. Another brother of Samuel, called David, was killed in 976 by the Vlachs, the guards of caravans, between Prespa and Kastoria. Although the titular emperor Roman of Bulgaria was captured in 991, Basil lost Moesia to the Bulgarians.

While Basil was distracted with internal rebellions and recovering the military situation on his eastern frontier, Samuel had extended his rule from the Adriatic Sea to the Black Sea, recovering most of the territory that was controlled by Bulgaria before the invasion of Svyatoslav. He also conducted damaging raids into Byzantine territory as far as central Greece. In 996, the Byzantine general Nikephoros Ouranos defeated a Bulgarian army raid at the Battle of Spercheios in Thessaly. Samuel and his son Gabriel narrowly escaped capture.

Beginning in 1000, Basil was free to focus on a war of conquest against Bulgaria, which he fought with grinding persistence and strategic insight. In 1000, the Byzantine generals Nikephoros Xiphias and Theodorokanos took the former Bulgarian capital Great Preslav, and the towns Lesser Preslav and Pliskova. In 1001, Basil, operating from Thessalonica, regained control of Vodena, Verrhoia and Servia. The following year, he based his army in Philippopolis and occupied the length of the military road from the western Haemus Mountains to the Danube, cutting off communications between Samuel&#x27;s Macedonian heartland and Paristrion (the lands south of the lower Danube). Following this success, Basil laid siege to Vidin, which fell after a prolonged resistance. Samuel reacted to the Byzantine campaign by launching a large-scale raid into the heart of Byzantine Thrace and took the major city of Adrianople by surprise.

After turning homeward with his extensive plunder, Samuel was intercepted near Skopje by a Byzantine army commanded by Basil, whose forces stormed the Bulgarian camp, defeating the Bulgarians and recovering the plunder from Adrianople. Skopje surrendered shortly after the battle, and Basil treated its governor Romanos with overt kindness. In 1005, the governor of Dyrrhachium Ashot Taronites surrendered his city to the Byzantines. The defection of Dyrrhachium completed the isolation of Samuel&#x27;s core territories in the highlands of western Macedonia. Samuel was forced into an almost entirely defensive stance; he extensively fortified the passes and routes from the coastlines and valleys held by the Byzantines to the territory remaining in his possession. During the next few years, the Byzantine offensive slowed and no significant gains were made, although an attempt by the Bulgarians to counter-attack in 1009 was defeated at the Battle of Kreta, to the east of Thessalonica.

In 1014, Basil was ready to launch a campaign aimed at destroying Bulgarian resistance. On 29 July 1014, in the Battle of Kleidion, he and his general Nikephoros Xiphias outmaneuvered the Bulgarian army, which was defending one of the fortified passes. Samuel avoided capture through the valor of his son Gabriel. Having crushed the Bulgarians, Basil exacted his vengeance cruelly—he was said to have captured 15,000 prisoners and fully blinded 99 of every 100 men, leaving one one-eyed man in each cohort to lead the rest back to their ruler. A possible reason for this vengeance was that, in Byzantine eyes, the Bulgarians were rebels against their authority, and blinding was the usual punishment meted out to rebels. Samuel was struck down by the sight of his blinded army and died two days later on 6 October 1014 after suffering a stroke.

Bulgaria fought on for four more years, its resistance fired by Basil&#x27;s cruelty, but it submitted in 1018. This submission was the result of continued military pressure and a successful diplomatic campaign aimed at dividing and suborning the Bulgarian leadership. This victory over the Bulgarians and the later submission of the Serbs fulfilled one of Basil&#x27;s goals; the Empire regained its ancient Danubian frontier for the first time in 400 years.

The rulers of neighbouring Croatia, Krešimir III and Gojslav, who were previously allies of Bulgaria, accepted Basil&#x27;s supremacy to avoid the same fate as Bulgaria; Basil warmly received their offers of vassalage and awarded them the honorary title of &quot;patrikios&quot;. Croatia remained a tributary state to Basil until his death in 1025. Before returning to Constantinople, Basil celebrated his triumph in Athens. He showed considerable statesmanship in his treatment of the defeated Bulgarians, giving many former Bulgarian leaders court titles, positions in provincial administration, and high commands in the army. In this way, he sought to absorb the Bulgarian elite into Byzantine society. Because Bulgaria did not have a monetary economy to the same extent as Byzantium, Basil decided to accept Bulgarian taxes in kind. Basil&#x27;s successors reversed this policy, a decision that led to considerable Bulgarian discontent and rebellion later in the 11th century.
===Khazar campaign===
Although the Kievan Rus&#x27; had broken the power of the Khazar Khaganate in the 960s, the Byzantines had not been able to fully exploit the power vacuum and restore their dominion over Crimea and other areas around the Black Sea. In 1016, Byzantine armies in conjunction with Mstislav of Chernigov attacked the Crimea, much of which had fallen under the control of the Khazar successor kingdom of George Tzoul based at Kerch. Kedrenos reports that Tzoul was captured and the Khazar successor kingdom was destroyed. Subsequently, the Byzantines occupied southern Crimea.

=== Campaigns against Georgia ===

The integrity of the Byzantine Empire was threatened after a full-scale rebellion led by Bardas Skleros broke out in 976. After winning a series of battles, the rebels conquered Asia Minor. In the urgency of the situation, Georgian prince David III of Tao aided Basil; after a decisive loyalist victory at the Battle of Pankaleia, he was rewarded by lifetime rule of key imperial territories in eastern Asia Minor. David&#x27;s rebuff of Basil in Bardas Phokas&#x27; revolt of 987, however, evoked Constantinople&#x27;s distrust of the Georgian rulers. After the revolt&#x27;s failure, David was forced to make Basil the legatee of his extensive possessions. In 1001, after the death of David of Tao, Basil inherited Tao, Phasiane and Speri. These provinces were then organized into the theme of Iberia with the capital at Theodosiopolis. This forced the successor Georgian Bagratid ruler Bagrat III to recognize the new rearrangement. Bagrat&#x27;s son George I, however, inherited a longstanding claim to David&#x27;s succession. George, who was young and ambitious, launched a campaign to restore the Kuropalates&#x27;s succession to Georgia and occupied Tao in 1015–1016. He entered in an alliance with the Fatimid caliph of Egypt, al-Hakim, forcing Basil to refrain from an acute response to George&#x27;s offensive. The Byzantines were also involved in a relentless war with the Bulgarians, limiting their actions to the west. As soon as Bulgaria was conquered in 1018 and al-Hakim was dead, Basil led his army against Georgia. Preparations for a larger-scale campaign against the Kingdom of Georgia were set, beginning with the re-fortification of Theodosiopolis.

In late 1021, Basil, at the head of a large Byzantine army reinforced by the Varangian Guard, attacked the Georgians and their Armenian allies, recovering Phasiane and continuing beyond the frontiers of Tao into inner Georgia. King George burned the city of Oltisi to prevent it falling to the enemy and retreated to Kola. A bloody battle was fought near the village Shirimni at Lake Palakazio on 11 September; the emperor won a costly victory, forcing George I to retreat northwards into his kingdom. Basil plundered the country and withdrew for winter to Trebizond.

Several attempts to negotiate the conflict failed. George received reinforcements from the Kakhetians and allied himself with the Byzantine commanders Nikephoros Phokas Barytrachelos and Nikephoros Xiphias in their abortive insurrection in the emperor&#x27;s rear. In December, George&#x27;s ally the Armenian king Senekerim of Vaspurakan, who was being harassed by the Seljuk Turks, surrendered his kingdom to the emperor. During early 1022, Basil launched a final offensive, defeating the Georgians at the Battle of Svindax. Menaced both by land and sea, George agreed to a treaty that handed over Tao, Phasiane, Kola, Artaan and Javakheti, and left his infant son Bagrat as Basil&#x27;s hostage.

===Fiscal policies===

In 992, Basil concluded a treaty with the Doge of Venice Pietro II Orseolo under terms reducing Venice&#x27;s custom duties in Constantinople from 30 &quot;nomismata&quot; to 17 &quot;nomismata&quot;. In return, the Venetians agreed to transport Byzantine troops to southern Italy in times of war. According to one estimate, a Byzantine landowning farmer might expect a profit of 10.2 &quot;nomismata&quot; after paying dues for half of his best-quality land. Basil was popular with the country farmers, the class that produced most of his army&#x27;s supplies and soldiers. To assure this continued, Basil&#x27;s laws protected small agrarian property owners and lowered their taxes. Despite the almost constant wars, Basil&#x27;s reign was considered an era of relative prosperity for the class.

Seeking to protect the lower and middle classes, Basil made ruthless war upon the system of immense estates in Asia Minor—which his predecessor Romanos I had endeavored to check—by executing a legal decree in January 996 that limited rights to property ownership. If the owner of an estate could prove that he claimed his estate prior to the Novels of Romanos, he would be allowed to keep it. If a person had illegally seized an estate following the Novels of Romanos, he would have his rights to the estate declared null and the legal owners could reclaim it. In 1002, Basil also introduced the &quot;allelengyon&quot; tax as a specific law obliging the &quot;dynatoi&quot; (wealthy landholders) to cover for the arrears of poorer tax-payers. Though it proved unpopular with the wealthier sections of Byzantine society, Basil did not abolish the tax; the emperor Romanos III abolished the &quot;allelengyon&quot; in 1028. By 1025, Basil—with an annual revenue of 7 million &quot;nomismata&quot;—was able to amass 14.4 million &quot;nomismata&quot; (or 200,000 pounds/90 tonnes of gold) for the Imperial treasury due to his prudent management. Despite his attempts to control the power of the aristocracy, they again took control of the government following his death.

===Military policies===
Basil II was praised by his army because he spent most of his reign campaigning with it rather than sending orders from Constantinople, as had most of his predecessors. This allowed his army to be largely supportive of him, often making his stance in political and church matters unquestionable. He lived the life of a soldier to the point of eating the same daily rations as the rest of the army. He also took the children of dead army officers under his protection and offered them shelter, food and education. Many of these children became his soldiers and officers, taking the places of their fathers. One of them, Isaac Komnenos, later became emperor himself.

Basil did not innovate in terms of military organization: in the conquered territories he introduced both the small themes or &quot;strategiai&quot;, centred around a fortress town, that were such a common feature of the 10th-century reconquests of the East under Phokas and Tzimiskes, as well as the extensive regional commands under a &quot;doux&quot; or &quot;katepano&quot; (Iberia in 1000, Asprakania or Upper Media in 1019/22, Paristrion in 1000/20, Bulgaria in 1018, and Sirmium in 1019). The exact size of the army under Basil II is unknown, but estimates put it as high as 110,000 men, excluding the imperial &quot;tagmata&quot; in Constantinople; a considerable force, compared with the nominal establishment force of 120,000 in the 9th–10th centuries, or the 150,000–160,000 of the field armies under Justinian I. At the same time, however, under Basil the practice began of relying on allied states—most notably Venice—for naval power, beginning the slow decline of the Byzantine navy during the 11th century.

===Later life, death and burial===

Basil II later secured the annexation of the sub-kingdoms of Armenia and a promise that its capital and surrounding regions would be willed to Byzantium following the death of its king Hovhannes-Smbat. In 1021, he also secured the cession of the Kingdom of Vaspurakan by its king Seneqerim-John, in exchange for estates in Sebasteia. Basil created a strongly fortified frontier in those highlands. Other Byzantine forces restored much of Southern Italy, which had been lost during the previous 150 years.

Basil was preparing a military expedition to recover the island of Sicily when he died on 15 December 1025, having had the longest reign among any Byzantine or Roman emperor. At the time of his death, the Empire stretched from southern Italy to the Caucasus and from the Danube to the Levant, which was its greatest territorial extent since the Muslim conquests four centuries earlier. Basil was to be buried in the last sarcophagus available in the rotunda of Constantine I in the Church of the Holy Apostles but he later asked his brother and successor Constantine VIII to be buried in the Church of St. John the Theologian (&quot;i.e.&quot;, the Evangelist) at the Hebdomon Palace complex outside the walls of Constantinople. The epitaph on Basil&#x27;s tomb celebrated his campaigns and victories. His final resting place carried the following inscription: In 1260, during the unsuccessful Nicean Byzantine siege of Constantinople, then held by the Latin Empire, a corpse was found, upright in a corner of the Church of St. John the Evangelist, with a shepherd&#x27;s flute placed in its mouth. An inscription allowed the Nicaean soldiers to identify the corpse as the remains of Basil II. The body of Basil II was transferred to the Monastery of the Saviour at Selymbria. The following year Constantinople was recovered by the Byzantines.

===Assessment===

An assessment of the reign in the eyes of the subsequent generations is given by Psellos:He crushed rebellions, subdued the feudal landowners, conquered the enemies of the Empire, notably in the Danubian provinces and the East. Everywhere the might of Roman arms was respected and feared. The treasury was overflowing with the accumulated plunder of Basil&#x27;s campaigns. Even the lamp of learning, despite the emperor&#x27;s known indifference, was burning still, if somewhat dimly. The lot of ordinary folk in Constantinople must have been pleasant enough. For most of them life was gay and colourful, and if the city&#x27;s defensive fortifications were at some points in disrepair they had no cause to dread attacks.

Basil II&#x27;s reign is one of the most significant in Byzantine history. His constant military campaigns led to the zenith of Byzantine power in the Middle Ages. The restoration of the Danubian frontier helped establish a more stable and secure border for the empire in Europe, maintaining a stronger barrier against Hungarian and Pecheneg raiders. The conquest of Bulgaria and the submission of the South Slavs created relative peace for the empire&#x27;s Balkan lands, keeping larger cities—including Constantinople—safe from the previously frequent sieges and looting. Basil&#x27;s military experience that allowed him to eventually turn the war against Bulgaria in the Byzantine Empire&#x27;s favor were gained through the revolts of Phokas and Skleros in Anatolia that challenged his throne and sometimes got close to deposing him. Basil&#x27;s creation of the Varangian Guard provided him and his successors with an elite mercenary force capable of changing battle outcomes and boosting morale that became feared by the emperor&#x27;s enemies.

At this time, the Macedonian Renaissance was taking effect, seeing the rise of classical Greek scholarship being assimilated into Christian art and the study of ancient Greek philosophy being widespread. The studies of these subjects, and the enlargement projects of the emperors, greatly expanded the library of the University of Constantinople, which again established itself as the main source of learning for its day. Though he was not a man of literature, Basil was a relatively pious ruler who involved himself in the construction of churches, monasteries and, to some extent, cities.

Literary works, eulogies and poems were made by the great cities of the Byzantine Empire that mostly tried to juxtapose the classic past of kingdoms and empires with the new expansion of Basil II in which he was compared with many important figures of the east such as Cyrus the Great and Artaxerxes. He was also particularly compared with Alexander the Great who was believed to be Basil&#x27;s ancestor. Classical works such as &quot;The Persians&quot; by the ancient Greek tragedian Aeschylus were among the most recited in the empire during the expansion given the different confrontations against the caliphates that the Byzantines indiscriminately and classically called &quot;Medes&quot;. Despite the great expansion during his reign, his military and non-scholastic character led him to be criticized and related to the ancient Spartan monarchs or tyrants who at that time were remembered for being men of action, cruelty and decision who, like Basil, paid little attention to promoting the arts or literary culture and preferred a military environment.

Basil II lacked heirs due to the &quot;dearth of cousins found within the Macedonian dynasty&quot;, so he was succeeded by his brother Constantine and his family, who proved to be ineffective rulers. Nevertheless, fifty years of prosperity and intellectual growth followed because the funds of state were full, the borders were safe from intruders, and the Empire remained the most powerful political entity of the age. At the end of Basil II&#x27;s reign, the Byzantine Empire had a population of approximately 12 million people.

Although they were beneficial, Basil&#x27;s achievements were reversed very quickly. Many of the Georgian, Armenian and Fatimid campaigns were undone after the succession crisis and eventual civil war after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. Because many of the empire&#x27;s governors went to the capital with their soldiers to seize power after the capture of emperor Romanos IV, the Anatolian frontier was largely left undefended against the Seljuk Empire. The Normans permanently pushed the Byzantines from Southern Italy in April 1071.

===Modern views and depictions in literature===
* Bulgarian commentator Alexander Kiossev wrote in &quot;Understanding the Balkans&quot;: &quot;The hero [of] a nation might be the villain of its neighbour ... The Byzantine emperor Basil the Murderer of Bulgarians, a crucial Greek pantheon figure, is no less important as [a] subject of hatred for our national mythology&quot;. During the 20th century in Greece, interest in Basil II led to a number of biographies and historical novels about him. One of these is &quot;Basil Bulgaroktonos&quot; (1964) by historical fiction writer . Written as a sequel to his previous work &quot;Theophano&quot; (1963) which focuses on Basil&#x27;s mother, it examines Basil&#x27;s life through three fictional narrators and has been continuously reprinted since 1964. Rosemary Sutcliff&#x27;s 1976 historical fiction novel &quot;Blood Feud&quot; depicts Basil II from the point of view of a member of his recently created Varangian Guard.
* Penelope Delta&#x27;s second novel &quot;Ton Kairo tou Voulgaroktonou&quot; (&quot;In the Years of the Bulgar-Slayer&quot;) is also set during the reign of Basil II. It was inspired by correspondence with the historian Gustave Schlumberger, a renowned specialist on the Byzantine Empire, and published in the early years of the 20th century, a time when the Struggle for Macedonia again set Greeks and Bulgarians in bitter enmity with each other. 
*Ion Dragoumis, who was Delta&#x27;s lover and was deeply involved in that struggle, in 1907 published the book &quot;Martyron kai Iroon Aima&quot; (&quot;Martyrs&#x27; and Heroes&#x27; Blood&quot;), which is resentful towards anything remotely Bulgarian. He urges Greeks to follow the example of Basil II: &quot;Instead of blinding so many people, Basil should have better killed them instead. On one hand these people would not suffer as eyeless survivors, on the other the sheer number of Bulgarians would have diminished by 15 000, which is something very useful.&quot; Later in the book, Dragoumis foresees the appearance of &quot;new Basils&quot; who would &quot;cross the entire country and will look for Bulgarians in mountains, caves, villages and forests and will make them flee in refuge or kill them&quot;.
* Basil Basileus is a comic book series by Theocharis Spyros and Chrysa Sakel. The plot and illustration is based on academic bibliography. The story is set in the early years of Basil II, from the time of John I Tzimiskes and the formation of the Varangian Guard until the final years of Basil II.

<text>Inspector Jacques Clouseau (), later granted the rank of Chief Inspector, is a fictional character in Blake Edwards&#x27; farcical &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; series. Clouseau&#x27;s immense ego, eccentricity, exaggerated French accent, and prominent mustache are all a parody of Hercule Poirot, the fictional Belgian detective created by Agatha Christie. He is portrayed by Peter Sellers in the original series, and also by Alan Arkin in the 1968 film &quot;Inspector Clouseau&quot; and, in a cameo, by Roger Moore (credited as Turk Thrust II) in the 1983 film &quot;Curse of the Pink Panther&quot;. In the 2006 reboot and its 2009 sequel, Clouseau is portrayed by Steve Martin. Clouseau&#x27;s likeness also appears in the Pink Panther animated cartoon shorts and segments, where he is known as simply &quot;the Inspector&quot;.

Clouseau is an inept and incompetent police detective in the French Sûreté, whose investigations quickly turn to chaos. His absent-mindedness and extreme clumsiness almost always lead to destruction of property: while interviewing witnesses in &quot;The Pink Panther Strikes Again&quot;, he falls down a set of stairs, gets his hand caught in a medieval knight&#x27;s gauntlet, then in a vase; knocks a witness senseless and voiceless, destroys a priceless piano, and accidentally causes a Scotland Yard superintendent to be shot in the buttocks, all within nearly five minutes. Despite his lack of judgment and skill, Clouseau always manages to solve his cases and finds the correct culprits almost entirely by accident. 

Clouseau is promoted to Chief Inspector over the course of the series, and is regarded in other countries as France&#x27;s greatest detective, until they encounter him directly. His incompetence, combined with his luck and his occasionally correct interpretations of the situation, frustrate his direct superior, former Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus so intensely, Dreyfus is eventually driven to insanity. 

While Clouseau is generally oblivious to his own ineptitude and genuinely believes he possesses superior expertise and intelligence, he occasionally appears to recognize his limitations. As a police detective, Clouseau also insists upon wearing ridiculously elaborate disguises and aliases that range from the mundane (a telephone company repairman) to the ludicrously preposterous (a buck-toothed hunchback with an oversized nose); but even in these absurd disguises he cannot hide his characteristic inanity.

Clouseau is a patriotic Frenchman; later films reveal he had fought in the French Resistance during the Second World War. He is repeatedly perplexed by transvestites, to the extent that he addresses them as &quot;Sir or Madam&quot;. He has been prone to infatuation (often reciprocated) ever since the first film, in which his antagonist cuckolds him. 

Clouseau&#x27;s faux French accent became much more exaggerated in the later films (for example, pronouncing &quot;room&quot; as &quot;reum&quot;; &quot;Pope&quot; as &quot;Peup&quot;; &quot;bomb&quot; as &quot;beumb&quot;; and &quot;bumps&quot; as &quot;beumps&quot;), and a frequent running gag in the movies was that even French characters had difficulty understanding what he was saying. In his earliest appearances, Clouseau appears slightly less inept than in the later films; but even in his first appearance he believes himself a skilled violinist, but plays out of tune, and often appears clumsy at moments of highest seriousness. Sellers maintained that Clouseau&#x27;s oversized ego made his klutziness even funnier, particularly in his regular attempts to remain dignified, elegant, and refined while causing comic chaos.

===Films===
====&quot;The Pink Panther&quot; (1963)====
Jacques Clouseau makes his first appearance as the Inspector in the 1963 film &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;, which was released in the United States in March 1964. The movie is centered on David Niven&#x27;s role as Sir Charles Lytton, the infamous jewel thief nicknamed &quot;the Phantom&quot;, and his plan to steal the Pink Panther diamond from a vacationing princess. The Clouseau character was a supporting, comedic role as Lytton&#x27;s incompetent and oblivious antagonist. Clouseau&#x27;s wife Simone (Capucine), is secretly Sir Charles&#x27;s lover and accomplice, and departs with him at the end of the film after they have framed Clouseau for the theft of the Pink Panther.

====&quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot; (1964)====
&quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot; (1964) was based upon a stage play that originally did not include the Clouseau character. In this film, Sellers began to develop the exaggerated French accent that later became a hallmark of the character. The film also introduces two of the series&#x27; regular characters: his superior, Commissioner Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), who is driven mad by Clouseau&#x27;s blundering in the investigation; and his long-suffering Chinese manservant, Cato (Burt Kwouk), who is expected to improve Clouseau&#x27;s martial arts skills by attacking him at random.

====&quot;Inspector Clouseau&quot; (1968)====
In &quot;Inspector Clouseau&quot;, the character was portrayed by American actor Alan Arkin; Blake Edwards was not involved in this production. The film&#x27;s opening credits, animated by TVC London for DePatie-Freleng Enterprises, feature their Inspector character from the series of cartoon shorts under that title. Sellers declined to appear as Clouseau in &quot;Inspector Clouseau&quot; (1968) but he returned for &quot;The Return of the Pink Panther&quot; (1975) and its sequels.

====&quot;The Return of the Pink Panther&quot; (1975)====
The 1968 film does appear to have influenced the Clouseau character when Sellers returned to the role in &quot;The Return of the Pink Panther&quot; (1975), particularly in the character&#x27;s mode of dress. According to DVD liner notes for &quot;The Return of the Pink Panther&quot;, Sellers and Edwards originally planned to produce a British television series centered on Clouseau, but this film was made instead. The opening credits were animated by Richard Williams. The plot centers on Clouseau once again seeking to retrieve the stolen Pink Panther diamond. David Niven was unavailable to reprise the role of Sir Charles Lytton, so Christopher Plummer was cast. Catherine Schell appears as Lady Lytton.
The film was a financial success and led to Edwards quickly developing a sequel.

====&quot;The Pink Panther Strikes Again&quot; (1976)====
&quot;The Pink Panther Strikes Again&quot; continues the story from the end of &quot;The Return of the Pink Panther&quot;, featuring the now-insane Dreyfus creating a crime syndicate and constructing a doomsday weapon with the intention of using it to blackmail world leaders to assassinate Clouseau. Like the previous film, it was a box office success. Unused footage from this film was used to include Sellers in &quot;Trail of the Pink Panther&quot;. The opening credits were again animated by Richard Williams.

====&quot;Revenge of the Pink Panther&quot; (1978)====
After the success of &quot;The Pink Panther Strikes Again&quot;, Edwards and Sellers reunited for their final film, &quot;Revenge of the Pink Panther&quot; which has Clouseau investigating a plot to kill him by a prominent businessman who is head of the French Connection. The movie was another box office success and led to several more sequels after Sellers death in July, 1980. Biographies of Sellers such as &quot;Peter Sellers—A Celebration&quot; reveal that he was involved in the pre-production of another Clouseau film, &quot;Romance of the Pink Panther&quot;, at the time of his death.

====&quot;Trail of The Pink Panther&quot; (1982)====
Blake Edwards attempted to continue telling Clouseau&#x27;s story despite the death of his lead actor. The 1982 film &quot;Trail of the Pink Panther&quot; utilized outtakes and alternative footage of Sellers as Clouseau in a new storyline in which a reporter (played by Joanna Lumley) investigates Clouseau&#x27;s disappearance. In the process, she interviews characters from past Clouseau films (including the Lyttons, played by the returning David Niven and Capucine), and also meets Clouseau&#x27;s equally inept father (played by Richard Mulligan).

====&quot;Curse of the Pink Panther&quot; (1983)====
The immediate sequel to &quot;Trail&quot;, &quot;Curse of the Pink Panther&quot;, reveals that Clouseau underwent plastic surgery to change his appearance; the character appears on screen briefly in the form of a joke cameo appearance by Roger Moore, billed as &quot;Turk Thrust II&quot;. David Niven and Capucine again reprise their original &quot;Pink Panther&quot; roles as the Lyttons, now also joined by the returning Robert Wagner as nephew George Lytton. Neither &quot;Trail&quot; nor &quot;Curse&quot; were box office moneymakers, and the series was retired for about a decade due to a lengthy period of litigation between Edwards and MGM over the film&#x27;s release date.

====&quot;Son of the Pink Panther&quot; (1993)====
Despite the failure of &quot;Curse&quot;, Edwards attempted to revive the series a decade later with &quot;Son of the Pink Panther&quot;, in which it is revealed that Clouseau had illegitimate children by Maria Gambrelli (played by Elke Sommer in &quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot;, although recast in this film as Claudia Cardinale, who played the Princess in &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;). Clouseau&#x27;s son, Jacques Jr., was portrayed by Roberto Benigni, and has a twin sister, Jacqueline, played by Nicoletta Braschi. Jacques Jr. attempts to follow in his father&#x27;s police footsteps, but is revealed to have inherited his ineptitude. Herbert Lom and Burt Kwouk made their final appearances as Dreyfus and Cato in this film.

====&quot;The Pink Panther&quot; (2006)====
Steve Martin&#x27;s portrayal of Clouseau in the reboot 2006 film has Clouseau as a bumbling Gendarme hired by Chief Inspector Dreyfus to serve as the visible face of a high-profile murder investigation, so that Dreyfus can carry out his own investigation without risking repercussions of failure; but Martin&#x27;s Clouseau is considerably older than Sellers&#x27;. Although foolish, Martin&#x27;s Clouseau is generally more intelligent and competent than Sellers&#x27; version, as he is able to locate the Pink Panther diamond and solve the case by knowledge, and observation, of obscure data. A running gag in this and the following film has Clouseau randomly attacking his partner, Gilbert Ponton, only to be countered each time. This is a mirror image of the running gag in the original films wherein Clouseau&#x27;s original sidekick, Cato Fong, attacked Clouseau in order to keep Clouseau&#x27;s skills sharp.

====&quot;The Pink Panther 2&quot; (2009)====

When a series of rare and historical artifacts are stolen by the mysterious jewel thief &quot;The Tornado&quot;, Clouseau is assigned to a &quot;dream team&quot; of international investigators to recover the artifacts and the Pink Panther. Despite appearing to be bumbling and clumsy as usual, Clouseau once again displays surprising cleverness through his unorthodox methods. For example, he replaces the Pink Panther with a near perfect fake, reasoning that if The Tornado were the culprit, he would have been able to tell that the Pink Panther was a fake. He also causes several problems for Dreyfus, as usual. The film culminates in his marriage to Nicole Durant, Dreyfus&#x27;s secretary.

<text>An assassination market is a prediction market where any party can place a bet (using anonymous electronic money and pseudonymous remailers) on the date of death of a given individual. This incentivises assassination of the individual, as parties with advanced knowledge of an assassination plot can profit by betting accurately on the date of the death. Because the payoff is for accurately picking the date rather than performing the assassination, it is substantially more difficult to assign criminal liability.

== History ==

Early uses of the terms &quot;assassination market&quot; and &quot;market for assassinations&quot; can be found (in both positive and negative lights) in 1994&#x27;s &quot;The Cyphernomicon&quot; by Timothy C. May, a cypherpunk. The concept and its potential effects are also referred to as assassination politics, a term popularized by Jim Bell in his 1995–96 essay of the same name.

Early in part 1, Jim Bell describes the idea as:

Bell then goes on to further specify the protocol of the assassination market in more detail. In the final part of his essay, Bell posits a market that is largely non-anonymous. He contrasts this version with the one previously described. Carl Johnson&#x27;s attempt to popularise the concept of assassination politics appeared to rely on the earlier version. There followed an attempt to popularise the second in 2001 that is ongoing today.

Technologies such as Tor and Bitcoin have enabled online assassination markets, as described in parts one to nine of &quot;Assassination Politics&quot;.

== Assassination Market website ==
The first prediction market entitled &#x27;Assassination Market&#x27; was created by a self-described crypto-anarchist in 2013. Utilising Tor to hide the site&#x27;s location and Bitcoin based bounties and prediction technology, the site lists bounties on US President Barack Obama, economist Ben Bernanke and former justice minister of Sweden Beatrice Ask (all of whom are still alive as of February 2025). In 2015, the site was suspected to be defunct, but the deposited Bitcoins were cashed out in 2018.

<text>Fun is defined by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; as &quot;light-hearted pleasure, enjoyment, or amusement; boisterous joviality or merrymaking; entertainment&quot;.

==Etymology and usage==
The word &quot;fun&quot; is associated with sports, entertaining media, high merriment, and amusement. Although its etymology is uncertain, it has been speculated that it may be derived from Middle English &#x27; (fool) and &#x27; (the one fooling the other). An 18th century meaning (still used in Orkney and Shetland) was &quot;cheat, trick, hoax&quot;, a meaning still retained in the phrase &quot;to make fun of&quot;.

The way the word &quot;fun&quot; is used demonstrates its distinctive elusiveness and happiness. Expressions such as &quot;!&quot; and &quot;That was fun!&quot; indicate that fun is pleasant, personal, and to some extent unpredictable. Expressions such as &quot;I was making fun of myself&quot; convey the sense that fun is something that can be amusing and not to be taken seriously. The adjective &quot;funny&quot; has two meanings, which often need to be clarified between a speaker and listener. One meaning is &quot;amusing, jocular, droll&quot; and the other meaning is &quot;odd, quirky, peculiar&quot;. These differences indicate the evanescent and experiential nature of fun and the difficulty of distinguishing &quot;fun&quot; from &quot;enjoyment&quot;.

Fun&#x27;s evanescence can be seen when an activity regarded as fun becomes goal-oriented. Many physical activities and individual sports are regarded as fun until the participant seeks to win a competition, at which point, much of the fun may disappear as the individual&#x27;s focus tightens. Surfing is an example. If you are a &quot;mellow soul&quot; (not in a competition or engaging in extreme sport) &quot;once you&#x27;re riding waves, you&#x27;re guaranteed to be having fun&quot;.

The pleasure of fun can be seen by the numerous efforts to harness its positive associations. For example, there are many books on serious subjects, about skills such as music, mathematics and languages, normally quite difficult to master, which have &quot;fun&quot; added to the title.

==Activities==
Many physical activities provide opportunities to play and have fun. Not only can these activities be fun, but can also improve physical and mental states.
==Psychology==

According to Johan Huizinga, fun is &quot;an absolutely primary category of life, familiar to everybody at a glance right down to the animal level.&quot; Psychological studies reveal both the importance of fun and its effect on time perception, which is sometimes said to be shortened when one is having fun. As the adage states: &quot;&quot;.

It has been suggested that games, toys, and activities perceived as fun are often challenging in some way. When a person is challenged to think consciously, overcome challenge and learn something new, they are more likely to enjoy a new experience and view it as fun. A change from routine activities appears to be at the core of this perception, since people spend much of a typical day engaged in activities that are routine and require limited conscious thinking. Routine information is processed by the brain as a &quot;chunked pattern&quot;: &quot;We rarely look at the real world&quot;, according to game designer Raph Koster, &quot;we instead recognize something we have chunked, and leave it at that. [...] One might argue that the essence of much of art is in forcing us to see things as they really are rather than as we assume them to be&quot;. Since it helps people to relax, fun is sometimes regarded as a &quot;social lubricant&quot;, important in adding &quot;to one&#x27;s pleasure in life&quot; and helping to &quot;act as a buffer against stress&quot;.

For children, fun is strongly related to play and they have great capacity to extract the fun from it in a spontaneous and inventive way. Play &quot;involves the capacity to have fun – to be able to return, at least for a little while, to never-never land and enjoy it.&quot;

==Physiology==
Some scientists have identified areas of the brain associated with the perception of novelty, which are stimulated when faced with &quot;unusual or surprising circumstances&quot;. Information is initially received in the hippocampus, the site of long-term memory consolidation, where the brain attempts to match the new information with recognizable patterns stored in long-term memory. When it is unable to do this, the brain releases dopamine, a chemical which stimulates the amygdala, the site of emotion, and creates a pleasurable feeling that is associated with the new memory. In other words, fun is created by stimulating the brain with novelty.

==In popular culture==
With the emergence of entertainment industry, fun is sold as a consumer product in the form of games, novelties, television, toys and other amusements. Marxist sociologists such as the Frankfurt School criticise mass-manufactured fun as too calculated and empty to be fully satisfying. Bill Griffith satirises this dysphoria when his cartoon character Zippy the Pinhead asks mechanically, &quot;Are we having fun yet?&quot; In The Beatles song &quot;She&#x27;s Leaving Home&quot; fun is called &quot;the one thing that money can&#x27;t buy.&quot;

<doc id="46435" wikidata="Q187715" url="?curid=46435" title="Order of Assassins">
<text>The Order of Assassins or simply the Assassins (; ) were a Nizari Isma&#x27;ili order that existed between 1090 and 1275 AD, founded by Hasan al-Sabbah.

During that time, they lived in the mountains of Persia and the Levant, and held a strict subterfuge policy throughout the Middle East, posing a substantial strategic threat to Fatimid, Abbasid, and Seljuk authority, and killing several Christian leaders. Over the course of nearly 200 years, they killed hundreds who were considered enemies of the Nizari Isma&#x27;ili state. The modern term assassination is believed to stem from the tactics used by the Assassins.

Contemporaneous historians include ibn al-Qalanisi, Ali ibn al-Athir, and Ata-Malik Juvayni. The former two referred to the Assassins as &quot;batiniyya&quot;, an epithet widely accepted by Isma&#x27;ilis themselves.

==Overview==
The Assassins were founded by Hassan-i Sabbah. The state was formed in 1090 after the capture of Alamut Castle in the Alborz mountain range of Persia, which served as the Assassins&#x27; headquarters. The Alamut and Lambsar castles became the foundation of a network of Isma&#x27;ili fortresses throughout Persia and Syria that formed the backbone of Assassin power, and included Syrian strongholds at Masyaf, Abu Qubays, al-Qadmus and al-Kahf. The Western world was introduced to the Assassins by the works of Marco Polo who understood the name as deriving from the word hashish.

While Assassins typically refers to the entire group, only a group of disciples known as the &quot;fida&#x27;i&quot; actually engaged in conflict. The preferred method of killing was by dagger, nerve poison or arrows. The Assassins posed a substantial strategic threat to Fatimid, Abbasid, and Seljuk authority. Over the course of nearly 200 years, they killed hundreds – including three caliphs, a ruler of Jerusalem and several Muslim and Christian leaders.

Other notable victims of the Assassins include Janah ad-Dawla, emir of Homs, (1103), Mawdud ibn Altuntash, atabeg of Mosul (1113), Fatimid vizier Al-Afdal Shahanshah (1121), Seljuk atabeg Aqsunqur al-Bursuqi (1126), Fatimid caliph al-Amir bi-Ahkami’l-Lah (1130), Taj al-Mulk Buri, atabeg of Damascus (1132), and Abbasid caliphs al-Mustarshid (1135) and ar-Rashid (1138). Saladin, a major foe of the Assassins, escaped assassination twice (1175–1176). The first Frank known to have been killed by the Assassins was Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, in 1152. The Assassins were acknowledged and feared by the Crusaders, losing the &quot;de facto&quot; King of Jerusalem, Conrad of Montferrat, to an Assassin&#x27;s blade in 1192 and Lord Philip of Montfort of Tyre in 1270.

Accounts of the Assassins were preserved within Western, Arabic, Syriac, and Persian sources where they are depicted as trained killers, responsible for the systematic elimination of opposing figures. European orientalists in the 19th and 20th centuries also referred to the Isma&#x27;ili Assassins in their works, writing about them based on accounts in seminal works by medieval Arab and Persian authors, particularly ibn al-Qalanisi&#x27;s &quot;Mudhayyal Ta&#x27;rikh Dimashq&quot; (&quot;Continuation of the Chronicle of Damascus&quot;), ibn al-Athir&#x27;s &quot;al-Kāmil fit-Tārīkh&quot; (&quot;The Complete History&quot;), and Juvayni&#x27;s &quot;Tarīkh-i Jahān-gushā&quot; (&quot;History of the World Conqueror&quot;)&quot;.&quot;

The Order would finally come to an end during the rule of Imam Rukn al-Din Khurshah when the Isma&#x27;ili State was eventually destroyed as Khurshah surrendered the castles after the Mongol invasion of Persia. Khurshah died in 1256 and, by 1275, the Mongols had destroyed and eliminated the order of Assassins.

==History==
===Origins===

Hassan-i Sabbah was born in Qom, ca. 1050, and did his religious studies in Cairo with the Fatimids. Sabbah&#x27;s father was a Qahtanite Arab, said to be a descendant of Himyaritic kings, having emigrated to Qom from Kufa. He made his way to Persia where, through subterfuge, he and his followers captured Alamut Castle in 1090. Sabbah adapted the fortress to suit his needs not only for defense from hostile forces, but also for indoctrination of his followers. After laying claim to the fortress at Alamut, Sabbah began expanding his influence outwards to nearby towns and districts, using his agents to gain political favour and to intimidate the local populations. Spending most of his days at Alamut producing religious works and developing doctrines for his order, Sabbah would never again leave his fortress. The strangler sects were stopped by the Umayyads; the Assassins would not be by the later caliphates.

Shortly after establishing their headquarters at Alamut Castle, the sect captured Lambsar Castle, to be the largest of the Isma&#x27;ili fortresses and confirming the Assassins&#x27; power in northern Persia. The estimated date of the capture of Lambsar varies between 1096 and 1102. The castle was taken under the command of Kiya Buzurg Ummid, later Sabbah&#x27;s successor, who remained commandant of the fortress for twenty years. No interactions between the Christian forces of the First Crusade and the Assassins have been noted, with the latter concentrating on the Muslim enemies of the former. Other than a mention of Tancred&#x27;s 1106 taking of Apamea (see below) in &quot;Gesta Tancredi&quot;, Western Europe likely first learned of the Assassins from the chronicles of William of Tyre, &quot;A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea,&quot; published much later.

One of Sabbah&#x27;s disciples named Dihdar Bu-Ali from Qazvin rallied local supporters to deflect the Seljuks. Their attack on Alamut Castle and surrounding areas was canceled upon the death of the sultan. The new sultan Berkyaruq, son of Malik Shah I, did not continue the direct attack on Alamut, concentrating on securing his position against rivals, including his half-brother Muhammad I Tapar, who eventually settled for a smaller role, becoming &quot;malik&quot; (translated as &quot;king&quot;) in Armenia and Azerbaijan.

Sabbah is reputed to have remarked, &quot;the killing of this devil is the beginning of bliss&quot;. Of the 50 assassinations conducted during Sabbah&#x27;s reign, more than half were Seljuk officials, many of whom supported Muhammad I Tapar.

The Assassins seized Persian castles of Rudkhan and Gerdkuh in 1096, before turning to Syria. Gerdkuh was re-fortified by Mu&#x27;ayyad al-Din Muzaffar ibn Ahmad Mustawfi, a Seljuk who was a secret Isma&#x27;ili convert, and his son Sharaf al-Din Muhammad. There they occupied the fortress at Shaizar held by the Banu Munqidh, using it to spread terror to Isfahan, the heart of the Seljuk Empire. A rebellion by the local population drove the Assassins out, but they continued to occupy a smaller fortress at Khalinjan. In 1097, Berkyaruq associate Bursuq was killed by Assassins.

By 1100, Berkyaruq had consolidated his power, and the Assassins increased their presence by infiltrating the sultan&#x27;s court and army. Day-to-day functions of the court were frequently performed while armored and with weapons. The next year, he tasked his brother Ahmad Sanjar, then ruler of Khorasan, to attack Assassin strongholds in Quhistan. The siege at Tabas was at first successful, with the walls of the fortress breached, but then was lifted, possibly because the Seljuk commander had been bribed. The subsequent attack was devastating to the Assassins, but the terms granted were generous and they were soon reestablished at both Quhistan and Tabas. In the years following, the Assassins continued their mission against religious and secular leaders. Given these successes, they began expanding their operations into Syria.

===Expansion into Syria===
The first &quot;da&#x27;i&quot; Hassan-i dispatched to Syria was al-Hakim al-Munajjim, a Persian known as the physician-astrologer, establishing a cell in Aleppo in the early 12th century. Ridwan, the emir of Aleppo, was in search of allies and worked closely with al-Hakim. The alliance was first shown in the assassination in 1103 of Janah ad-Dawla, emir of Homs and a key opponent of Ridwan. He was murdered by three Assassins at the Great Mosque of al-Nuri in Homs. Al-Hakim died a few weeks later and was succeeded by Abu Tahir al-Sa’igh, a Persian known as the goldsmith.

While successful in cleaning the Assassins, they remained untouchable in their strongholds in the north. An eight-year war of attrition was initiated by the son of the first Assassin victim. The mission had some successes, negotiating a surrender of Khalinjan with local Assassin leader Ahmad ibn &#x27;Abd al-Malik ibn Attāsh, with the occupants allowed to go to Tabas and Arrajan. During the siege of Alamut, a famine resulted and Hassan had his wife and daughters sent to the fortress at Gerdkuh. After that time, Assassins never allowed their women to be at their fortresses during military campaigns, both for protection and secrecy. In the end, ibn Attāsh did not fulfill his commitment and was flayed alive, his head delivered to the sultan.In Syria, Abu Tahir al-Sa’igh, Ridwan and Abu&#x27;l Fath of Sarmin conspired in 1106 to send a team of Assassins to murder Khalaf ibn Mula&#x27;ib, emir of Apamea (Qalaat al-Madiq). Some of Khalaf&#x27;s sons and guards were also killed and, after the murder, Ridwan became overlord of Apamea and its fortress Qal&#x27;at al-Madiq, with Abu&#x27;l Fath as emir. A surviving son of Khalaf escaped and turned to Tancred, who was at first content to leave the city in the hands of the Isma&#x27;ilis and simply collect tribute. Later, he returned and captured the city for Antioch, as the town&#x27;s residents overwhelmingly approved of Frankish rule. Abu&#x27;l Fath was tortured to death, while Abu Tahir ransomed himself and returned to Aleppo. This encounter, the first between the Crusaders and the Assassins, did not deter the latter from their prime mission against the Seljuks.

Not so lucky were Ubayd Allah al-Khatib, &quot;qadi&quot; of Isfahan, and a &quot;qadi&quot; of Nishapur, both of whom succumbed to the Assassins&#x27; blade.

The Assassins wreaked havoc on the Syrian rulers, with their first major kill being that of Mawdud, atabeg of Mosul, in 1113. Mawdud was felled by Assassins in Damascus while a guest of Toghtekin, atabeg of Damascus. He was replaced at Mosul by al-Bursuqi, who himself would be a victim of the Assassins in 1126. Toghtekin&#x27;s son, the great Buri, founder of the Burid dynasty, would fall victim to the Assassins in 1131, dying a year later due to his injuries.

Ridwan died in 1113 and was succeeded as ruler of Aleppo by his son Alp Arslan al-Akhras. Alp Arslan continued his father&#x27;s conciliatory approach to the Assassins. A warning from Muhammad I Tapar and a prior attempt of the assassination of Abu Harb Isa ibn Zayd, a wealthy Persian merchant, led to a wholescale expulsion of the Assassins from Aleppo in that same year. Led by militia commander Sāʿid ibn Badī, the attack resulted in the execution of Abu Tahir al-Sa’igh and the brother of al-Hakim al-Munajjim, with 200 other Assassins killed or imprisoned, some thrown from the top of the citadel. Many took refuge with the Banu Munqidh at Shaizar. Revenge was slow but sure, taken out on Sāʿid ibn Badī in 1119. The shiftless Arp Arslan had exiled Sāʿid to Qalʿat Jaʿbar, where he was murdered along with two of his sons by Assassins.

The Assassins struck again in Damascus in 1116. While a guest of Toghtekin&#x27;s, Kurdish emir Ahmad-Il ibn Ibrāhim ibn Wahsūdān was sitting next to his host when a grieving man approached with a petition he wished be conveyed to Muhammad I Tapar. When Ahmad-Il accepted the document, he was stuck with a dagger, then again and again by a second and third accomplice. It was thought that the real target may have been Toghtekin, but the attackers were discovered to be Assassins, likely after Ahmad-Il, the foster brother of sultan.

In 1118, Muhammad I Tapar died and his brother Ahmad Sanjar became Seljuk sultan, and Hassan sent ambassadors to seek peace. When Sanjar rebuffed these ambassadors, Hassan then sent his Assassins to the sultan. Sanjar woke up one morning with a dagger stuck in the ground beside his bed. Alarmed, he kept the matter a secret. A messenger from Hassan arrived and stated, &quot;Did I not wish the sultan well that the dagger which was struck in the hard ground would have been planted on your soft breast&quot;. For the next several decades there ensued a ceasefire between the Isma&#x27;ilis and the Seljuks. Sanjar himself pensioned the Assassins on taxes collected from the lands they owned, gave them grants and licenses, and even allowed them to collect tolls from travelers.

By 1120, the Assassins&#x27; position in Aleppo had improved to the point that they demanded the small citadel of Qal&#x27;at ash-Sharif from Ilghazi, then Artuqid emir of Aleppo. Rather than refuse, he had the citadel demolished. The Assassins&#x27; influence in Aleppo came to an end in 1124 when they were expelled by Belek Ghazi, a successor to Ilghazi. Nevertheless, the &quot;qadi&quot; ibn al-Khashahab who had overseen the demolition of Qal&#x27;at ash-Sharif was killed by Assassins in 1125. At the same time, the Assassins of Diyarbakir were set upon by the locals, resulting in hundreds killed.

In 1121, Al-Afdal Shahanshah, the vizier of the Fatimid Caliphate, was murdered by three Assassins from Aleppo, causing a seven-day celebration among the Isma&#x27;ilis and no great mourning among the court of Fatimid caliph al-Amir bi-Ahkam Allah who resented his growing boldness. Al-Afdal Shahanshah was replaced as vizier by al-Ma&#x27;mum al-Bata&#x27;ihi who was instructed to prepare a letter of rapprochement between Cairo and Alamut. Upon learning of a plot to kill both al-Amir and al-Ma&#x27;mum, such ideas were disbanded, and severe restrictions on dealing with the Assassins were instead put in place.

===The next generation===

In 1124, Hassan-i Sabbah died, leaving a legacy that reverberated throughout the Middle East for centuries. He was succeeded at Alamut by Kiya Buzurg Ummid.

The appointment of a new &quot;da&#x27;i&quot; at Alamut may have led the Seljuks to believe the Assassins were in a weakened position, and Ahmad Sanjar launched an attack on them in 1126. Led by Sanjar&#x27;s vizier Mu&#x27;in ad-Din Kashi, the Seljuks again struck at Quhistan and also Nishapur in the east, and at Rudbar to the north. In the east, the Seljuks had minor successes at a village near Sabzevar, where the population was destroyed, their leader leaping from the mosque&#x27;s minaret, and at Turaythirth in Nishapur, where the attackers &quot;killed many, took much booty, and then returned.&quot; At best, the results were not decisive, but superior to the routing the Seljuks received in the north, with one expedition driven back, losing their previous booty, and another having a Seljuk commander captured. In the end, the Isma&#x27;ili position was better than before the offensive. In the guise of a peace offering of two Arabian horses, Assassins gained the confidence of Mu&#x27;in ad-Din Kashi and killed him in 1127.

At the same time, in Syria, a Persian named Bahram al-Da&#x27;i, the successor to Abu Tahir al-Sa’igh who had been executed in Aleppo in 1113, appeared in Damascus reflecting cooperation between the Assassins and Toghtekin, including a joint operation against the Crusaders. Bahram, a Persian from Asterabad (present-day Gorgan), had lived in secrecy after the expulsion of the Assassins from Aleppo and was the nephew of the Assassin Abu Ibrahim al-Asterbadi who had been executed by Berkyaruq in 1101. Bahram was most likely behind the murder of al-Bursuqi in 1126, whose assassination may have been ordered by the Seljuk sultan Mahmud II. He later established a stronghold near Banias. During an attack on the Lebanese valley of Wadi al-Taym, Bahram captured and tortured to death a local chieftain named Baraq ibn Jandal. In retaliation, his brother Dahhak ibn Jandal killed Bahram in 1127. So great was the fear and hatred of the Assassins that the messenger delivering Bahram&#x27;s head and hands to Cairo was rewarded with a robe of honor. That fear was justified as caliph al-Amir bi-Ahkam Allah was murdered at court in 1130 by ten Assassins.

The Isma&#x27;ili response to the Seljuk invasion of 1126 was multi-faceted. In Rudbar, a new and powerful fortress was built at Maymundiz and new territories acquired. To the east, the Seljuk stronghold of Sistan was raided in 1129. That same year, Mahmud II, son of Muhammad I Tapar, and sultan of Isfahan, decided to sue for peace with Alamut. Unfortunately, the Isma&#x27;ili envoys to Mahmud II were lynched by an angry mob following their audience with the sultan. The demand by Kiya Buzurg Ummid for punishment of the perpetrators was refused. That prompted an Assassin attack on Qazvin, resulting in the loss of 400 lives in addition to a Turkish emir. A counterattack on Alamut was inconclusive.

In Syria, Assassin leader Bahram was replaced by another mysterious Persian named Isma&#x27;il al-&#x27;Ajami who, like Bahram, was supported by al-Mazdaghani, the pro-Isma&#x27;ili vizier to Toghtekin. After the death of Toghtekin in 1128, his son and successor Taj a-Mulk Buri began working to free Damascus of the Assassins, supported by his military commander Yusuf ibn Firuz. al-Mazdaghani was murdered and his head publicly displayed. The Damascenes turned on the Assassins, leaving &quot;dogs yelping and quarreling over their limbs and corpses.&quot; At least 6000 Assassins died, and the rest, including Isma&#x27;il (who had turned Banias over to the Franks), fled to Frankish territory. Isma&#x27;il was killed in 1130, temporarily disabling the Assassins&#x27; Syrian mission. Nevertheless, Alamut organized a counterstrike, with two Persian Assassins disguised as Turkish soldiers striking down Buri in 1131. The Assassins were hacked to pieces by Buri&#x27;s guards, but Buri died of his wounds the following year.

Mahmud II died in 1131 and his brother Ghiyath ad-Din Mas&#x27;ud (Mas&#x27;ud) was recognized as successor by Abbasid caliph al-Mustarshid. The succession was contested by Mahmud&#x27;s son and other brothers, and al-Mustarshid was drawn into the conflict. The caliph al-Mustarshid was taken prisoner by Seljuk forces in 1135 near Hamadan and pardoned with the proviso that he abdicate. Left in his tent studying the Quran, he was murdered by a large group of Assassins. Some suspected Mas&#x27;ud and even Ahmad Sanjar with complicity, but the chronicles of contemporaneous Arab historians ibn al-Athir and ibn al-Jawzi do not bear that out. The Isma&#x27;ilis commemorated the caliph&#x27;s death with seven days and nights of celebration.

The reign of Buzurg Ummid ended with his death in 1138, showing a relatively small list of assassinations. He was succeeded by his son Muhammad Buzurg Ummid, sometimes referred to as Kiya Muhammad.

The Abbasids&#x27; celebration of the death of the Assassin leader Buzurg Ummid was short-lived. The son and successor of the last high-profile victim of the Assassins, al-Mustarshid, was ar-Rashid. Ar-Rashid was deposed by his uncle al-Muqtafi in 1136 and, while recovering from an illness in Isfahan, was murdered by Assassins. The addition of a second caliph to the Assassins&#x27; so-called &quot;role of honor&quot; of victims again resulted in a week of celebration at Alamut. Another significant success was the assassination of the son of Mahmud II, Da&#x27;ud, who ruled in Azerbaijan and Jibal. Da&#x27;ud was felled by four Assassins in Tabriz in 1143, rumored to have been dispatched by Zengi, atabeg of Mosul.

The decades after the assassination of al-Mustarshid showed an expansion of Assassin castles in Jabal Bahrā&#x27;, to the northwest of their Syrian fortresses in Jabal as-Summaq. In 1132, Saif al-Mulk ibn Amrun, emir of al-Kahf, recovered the fortress of al-Qadmus from the Franks, known to them as &quot;Bokabeis.&quot; He then sold the fortress to the Assassins in 1133. This was followed by the ceding of al-Kahf Castle itself to Assassin control in 1138 by Saif&#x27;s son Musa in the midst of a succession struggle. These were followed by the acquisition of the castle at Masyaf in 1140 and of Qala&#x27;at al-Khawabi, known to the Crusaders as &quot;La Coible&quot;, in 1141.

Relatively little is recorded concerning Assassin activity during this period until the Second Crusade. In 1149, an Assassin named Ali ibn-Wafa allied with Raymond of Poitiers, son of William IX of Aquitaine, to defend the borders of the Principality of Antioch against Zengid expansion. The forces met at the battle of Inab, with Zengi&#x27;s son and heir Nur ad-Din defeating the Franks, killing both Raymond and ibn-Wafa. Nur ad-Din would again foil the Assassins in 1158, incorporating a castle at Shaizar that they had occupied after the 1157 earthquake into his territory. Two assassinations are known from this period. In a revenge attack, Dahhak ibn Jandal, the Wadi al-Taym chieftain who had killed Assassin &quot;da&#x27;i&quot; Bahram in 1127, died from an Assassin&#x27;s blade in 1149. A few years later in 1152, possibly in retaliation to the establishment of the Knights Templar at Tartus, Raymond II, count of Tripoli, was killed by Assassins. This marked the first known Christian victim.

===Hassan II and Rashid ad-Din Sinan===

The fourteen known assassinations during the reign of Kiya Muhammad was a far cry from the tally of his predecessors, representing a significant decline in the power of the Isma&#x27;ilis. This was exemplified by the governors of Mazandaran and of Rayy who were said to have built towers out of Isma&#x27;ili skulls.

In the middle of Ramadan in 559 AH, Hassan II gathered his followers and announced to &quot;jinn, men and angels&quot; that the Hidden Imam had freed them &quot;from the burden of the rules of Holy Law&quot;. With that, the assembled took part in a ritual violation of Sharia, a banquet with wine, in violation of the Ramadan fast, with their backs turned towards Medina. Observance of Islamic rites (fasting, salat prayer, etc.) was punishable by the utmost severity. (According to Shīʿa hadiths, when the Hidden Imam/mahdi reappears, &quot;he will bring a new religion, a new book and a new law&quot;).
Resistance was nonetheless deep, and Hasan was stabbed to death by his own brother-in-law.

Hassan II shifted the focus of his followers from the exoteric to the esoteric (batin). He abrogated the exoteric practice of Sharia and stressed on the esoteric (batini) side of the laws. And &quot;while outwardly he was known as the grandson of Buzurgumid&quot;, in this esoteric reality, Lewis writes, Hasan claimed &quot;he was the Imam of the time&quot; (the last Imam of Shia Islam before the end of the world). The impact of these changes on Isma&#x27;ili life and politics were vast and continued after Hassan II&#x27;s death in 1166 by his son Nūr al-Dīn Muhammad, known as the Imam Muhammad II, who ruled from 1166 to 1210. It is in this context and the changes in the Muslim world brought about by the disintegration of the Seljuk empire that a new chief &quot;da&#x27;i&quot; of the Assassins was thrust: Rashid ad-Din Sinan, referred to as Sinān.

Rashid ad-Din Sinan, an alchemist and schoolmaster, was dispatched to Syria by Hassan II as a messenger of his Islamic views and to continue the Assassins&#x27; mission. Known as the greatest of the Assassin chiefs, Sinān first made headquarters at al-Kahf Castle and then the fortress of Masyaf. At al-Kahf, he worked with chief &quot;da&#x27;i&quot; Abu-Muhammad who was succeeded at his death by Khwaja Ali ibn Mas&#x27;ud without authority from Alamut. Khwaja was murdered by Abu-Muhammad&#x27;s nephew Abu Mansur, causing Alamut to reassert control. After seven years at al-Kahf, Sinān assumed that role&quot;,&quot; operating independently of and feared by Alamut, relocating the capital to Masyaf. Among his first tasks were the refurbishing of the fortress of ar-Rusafa and of Qala&#x27;at al-Khawabi, constructing a tower at the citadel of the latter. Sinān also captured the castle of al-&#x27;Ullaiqah at Aleika, near Tartus.

One of the first orders of business that Sinān confronted was the continuing threat from Nur ad-Din as well as the Knights Templar&#x27;s presence at Tartus. In 1173, Sinān proposed to Amalric of Jerusalem an alliance against Nur ad-Din in exchange for cancellation of the tribute imposed upon Assassin villages near Tartus. The Assassin envoys to the king were ambushed and slain by a Templar knight named Walter du Mesnil near Tripoli while returning from the negotiations, an act apparently sanctioned by the Templar Grand Master Odo de Saint Amand. Amalric demanded the knight be surrendered, but Odo refused, claiming only the pope had the authority to punish du Mesnil. Amalric had du Mesnil kidnapped and imprisoned at Tyre. Sinān accepted the king&#x27;s apology, assured that justice had been done. The point of the alliance became moot as both Nur ad-Din and Amalric died of natural causes soon thereafter.

These developments could not have been better for Saladin who wished to expand beyond Egypt into Jerusalem and Syria, first taking Damascus. With the Kingdom of Jerusalem being led by the 13-year old leperous Baldwin IV and Syria by the 11-year old as-Salih Ismail al-Malik, son of Nur ad-Din, he continued his campaign in Syria, moving against Aleppo. While besieging Aleppo in late 1174 or early 1175, the camp of Saladin was infiltrated by Assassins sent by Sinān and As-Salih&#x27;s regent Gümüshtigin. Nasih al-Din Khumartekin, emir of Abu Qubays, was killed in the attack which left Saladin unscathed. The next year, after taking Azaz, Assassins again struck, wounding Saladin. Gümüshtigin was again believed to be complicit in the assassination attempt. Turning his attention to Aleppo, the city was soon conquered and Saladin allowed as-Salih and Gümüshtigin to continue to rule, but under his sovereignty. Saladin then turned his attention back to the Assassins, besieging Masyaf in 1176. Failing to capture the stronghold, he settled for a truce. Accounts of a mystical encounter between Saladin and Sinān have been offered :

Saladin had his guards supplied with link lights and had chalk and cinders strewed around his tent outside Masyaf—which he was besieging—to detect any footsteps by the Assassins. According to this version, one night Saladin&#x27;s guards noticed a spark glowing down the hill of Masyaf and then vanishing among the Ayyubid tents. Presently, Saladin awoke to find a figure leaving the tent. He saw that the lamps were displaced and beside his bed laid hot scones of the shape peculiar to the Assassins with a note at the top pinned by a poisoned dagger. The note threatened that he would be killed if he did not withdraw from his assault. Saladin gave a loud cry, exclaiming that Sinan himself was the figure that had left the tent.

Another version claims that Saladin hastily withdrew his troops from Masyaf because they were urgently needed to fend off a Crusader force in the vicinity of Mount Lebanon. In reality, Saladin sought to form an alliance with Sinan and his Assassins, consequently depriving the Crusaders of a potent ally against him. Viewing the expulsion of the Crusaders as a mutual benefit and priority, Saladin and Sinan maintained cooperative relations afterwards, the latter dispatching contingents of his forces to bolster Saladin&#x27;s army in a number of decisive subsequent battlefronts.

By 1177, the conflict between Sinān and as-Salih continued with the assassination of Shihab ad-Din abu-Salih, vizier to both as-Salih and Nur ad-Din. A letter from as-Salih to Sinān requesting the murder was found to be a forgery by Gümüshtigin, causing his removal. As-Salih seized the village of al-Hajira from the Assassins, and in response Sinān&#x27;s followers burned the marketplace in Aleppo.

In 1190, Isabella I was Queen of Jerusalem and the Third Crusade had just begun. The daughter of Amalric, she married her first husband Conrad of Montferrat, who became king by virtue of marriage, not yet crowned. Conrad was of royal blood, the cousin of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and Louis VII of France. Conrad had been in charge of Tyre during the siege of Tyre in 1187 launched by Saladin, successfully defending the city. Guy of Lusignan, married to Isabella&#x27;s half-sister Sybilla of Jerusalem, was king of Jerusalem by right of marriage and had been captured by Saladin during the battle of Hattin in that same year, 1187. When Guy was released in 1188, he was denied entry to Tyre by Conrad and launched the siege of Acre in 1189. Queen Sybilla died of an epidemic sweeping her husband&#x27;s military camp in 1190, negating Guy&#x27;s claim to the throne and resulting in Isabella becoming queen.

Assassins disguised as Christian monks had infiltrated the bishopric of Tyre, gaining the confidence of both the archbishop Joscius and Conrad of Montferrat. There in 1192, they stabbed Conrad to death. The surviving Assassin is reputed to have named Richard I of England as the instigator, who had much to gain as demonstrated by the rapidity at which the widow married Henry II of Champagne. That account is disputed by ibn al-Athir who names Saladin in a plot with Sinān to kill both Conrad and Richard. Richard I was captured by Leopold V, Duke of Austria, and held by Henry VI, who had become Holy Roman Emperor in 1191, accused of murder. Sinān wrote to Leopold V absolving Richard I of complicity in the plot. Regardless, Richard I was released in 1194 after England paid his ransom and the murder remains unsolved. Adding to the continued cold case is the belief by modern historians that Sinan&#x27;s letter to Leopold V is a forgery, written by members of Richard I&#x27;s administration.

Conrad was Sinān&#x27;s last assassination. The great Assassin Rashid ad-Din Sinan, the Old Man of the Mountain, died in 1193, the same year that claimed Saladin. He died of natural causes at al-Kahf Castle and was buried at Salamiyah, which had been a secret hub of Isma&#x27;ili activity in the 9th and 10th centuries. His successor was Nasr al-&#x27;Ajami, under the control of Alamut, who reportedly met with emperor Henry VI in 1194. Later successors through 1227 included Kamāl ad-Din al-Hasan and Majd ad-Din, again under the control of Alamut. Saladin left his Ayyubid dynasty under his sons al-Aziz Uthman, sultan of Egypt, al-Afdal ibn Salah ad-Din, emir of Damascus, and az-Zahir Ghazi, emir of Aleppo. Al-Aziz died soon thereafter, replaced by Saladin&#x27;s brother al-Adil I.

===13th century===

In 1210, Muhammad III died and his son Jalāl al-Din Hasan (known as Hassan III) became Imam of the Isma&#x27;ili State. His first actions included the return to the Islamic orthodoxy by practising Taqiyyah to ensure safety of the Ismailis in the hostile environment. He claimed allegiance to the Sunnis to protect himself and his followers from further persecution. He had a Sunni mother and four Sunni wives. Hassan III recognized the Abbasid caliph al-Nasir who in turn granted a diploma of investiture. The Alamuts had a previous history with al-Nasir, supplying Assassins to attack a Kwarezm representative of shah Ala ad-Din Tekish, but that was more of an action of convenience than formal alliance. Maintaining ties to western Christian influences, the Alamuts became tributaries to the Knights Hospitaller beginning at the Isma&#x27;ili stronghold Abu Qubays, near Margat.

The count of Tripoli in 1213 was Bohemond IV, the fourth prince of Antioch of that name. That year his 18-year-old son Raymond, namesake of his grandfather, was murdered by the Assassins under Nasr al-&#x27;Ajami while at church in Tartus. Suspecting both Assassin and Hospitaller involvement, Bohemond and the Knights Templar laid siege to Qala&#x27;at al-Khawabi, an Isma&#x27;ili stronghold near Tartus, Appealing to the Ayyubids for help, az-Zahir Ghazi dispatched a relief force from Aleppo. His forces were nearly destroyed at Jabal Bahra. Az-Zahir&#x27;s uncle al-Adil I, emir of Damascus, responded and the Franks ended the siege by 1216. Bohemond IV would again fight the Ayyubids in the Fifth Crusade.

Majd ad-Din was the new chief &quot;da&#x27;i&quot; in Syria in 1220, assuming that role from Kamāl ad-Din al-Hasan of whom very little is known. At that time the Seljuk sultanate of Rûm paid an annual tribute to Alamut, and Majd ad-Din notified the sultan Kayqubad I that henceforth the tribute was to be paid to him. Kayqubad I requested clarification from Hassan III who informed him that the monies had indeed been assigned to Syria.

Hassan III died in 1221, likely from poisoning. He was succeeded by his 9-year-old son Imam &#x27;Alā ad-Din Muhammad, known as Muhammad III, and was the penultimate Isma&#x27;ili ruler of Alamut before the Mongol conquest. Because of his age, Hassan&#x27;s vizier served as regent to the young Imam, and put Hassan&#x27;s wives and sister to death for the suspected poisoning. Muhammad III reversed the Sunni course his father had set, returning to Shi&#x27;ite orthodoxy. His attempts to accommodate the advancing Mongols failed.

In 1225, Frederick II was Holy Roman Emperor, a position his father Henry VI had held until 1197. He had committed to prosecuting the Sixth Crusade and married the heiress to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, Isabella II. The next year, the once and future king sent envoys to Majd ad-Din with significant gifts for the imam to ensure his safe passage. Khwarezm had collapsed under the Mongols, but many of the Kwarezmians still operated as mercenaries in northern Iraq. Under the pretense that the road to Alamut was unsafe due to these mercenaries, Majd ad-Din kept the gifts for himself, and provided the safe passage. As a precaution, Majd ad-Din informed al-Aziz Muhammad, emir of Aleppo and son of az-Zahir Ghazi, of the emperor&#x27;s embassy. In the end, Frederick did not complete that trip to the Holy Land due to illness, being excommunicated in 1227. The Knights Hospitaller were not as accommodating as Alamut, demanding their share of the tribute. When Majd ad-Din refused, the Hospitallers attacked and carried off the majority of the booty. Majd ad-Din was succeeded by Sirāj ad-Din Muzaffa ibn al-Husain in 1227, serving as chief &quot;da&#x27;i&quot; until 1239.

Taj ad-Din Abu&#x27;l-Futūh ibn Muhammad was chief &quot;da&#x27;i&quot; in Syria in 1239, succeeding Sirāj ad-Din Muzaffa. At this point, the Assassins were an integral part of Syrian politics. The Arab historian Ibn Wasil had a friendship with Taj ad-Din and writes of Badr ad-Din, &quot;qadi&quot; of Sinjar, who sought refuge with Taj ad-Din to escape the wrath of Egyptian Ayyubid ruler as-Salih Ayyub. Taj ad-Din served until at least 1249 when he was replaced by Radi ad-Din Abu&#x27;l-Ma&#x27;āli.

In that same year, Louis IX of France embarked on the Seventh Crusade in Egypt. He captured the port of Damietta from the aging al-Salih Ayyub which he refused to turn over to Conrad II, who had inherited the throne of Jerusalem from his parents Frederick II and Isabella II. The Frankish Crusaders were soundly defeated by Abu Futuh Baibars, then a commander in the Egyptian army, at the battle of al-Mansurah in 1250. Saint Louis, as Louis IX was known, was captured by the Egyptians and, after a handsome reward was paid, spent four years in Acre, Caesarea and Jaffa. One of the captives with Louis was Jean de Joinville, biographer of the king, who reported the interaction of the monarch with the Assassins. While at Acre, emissaries of Radi ad-Din Abu&#x27;l-Ma&#x27;āli met with him, demanding a tribute be paid to their chief &quot;as the emperor of Germany, the king of Hungary, the sultan of Egypt and the others because they know well they can only live as long as it please him.&quot; Alternately, the king could pay the tribute the Assassins paid the Templars and Hospitallers. Later the king&#x27;s Arabic interpreter Yves the Breton met personally with Radi ad-Din and discussed the respective beliefs. Afterwards, the chief &quot;da&#x27;i&quot; went riding, with his valet proclaiming: &quot;Make way before him who bears the death of kings in his hands!&quot;

The Egyptian victory at al-Mansurah led to the establishment of the Mamluk dynasty in Egypt. Muhammad III was murdered in 1255 and replaced by his son Rukn al-Din Khurshah, the last Imam to rule Alamut. Najm ad-Din later became chief &quot;da&#x27;i&quot; of the Assassins in Syria, the last to be associated with Alamut. Louis IX returned to north Africa during the Eighth Crusade where he died of natural causes in Tunis.

===Downfall and aftermath===

The Assassins suffered a significant blow at the hands of the Mongol Empire during the well-documented invasion of Khwarazm. A decree was handed over to the Mongol commander Kitbuqa who began to assault several Assassin fortresses in 1253 before Hulagu&#x27;s advance in 1256. During the siege of Maymun-Diz, the last Ismaili Imam capitulated to the Mongols. The Imam ordered his subordinates to surrender and demolish their fortresses likewise. The subsequent capitulation of the symbolic stronghold of Alamut marked the end of the Nizari state in Persia. Lambsar fell in 1257, Masyaf in 1267. The Assassins recaptured and held Alamut for a few months in 1275, but they were crushed and their political power was lost forever. Rukn al-Din Khurshah was put to death shortly thereafter. Some strongholds continued to resist for many years, notably Gerdkuh.

Though the Mongol massacre at Alamut was widely interpreted to be the end of Isma&#x27;ili influence in the region, various sources say that the Isma&#x27;ilis&#x27; political influence continued. In 1275, a son of Imam Rukn al-Din Khurshah managed to recapture Alamut, though only for a few years. Isma&#x27;ili political activity in the region also seems to have continued under the leadership of Sultan Muhammad b. Jahangir and his son, until the latter&#x27;s execution in 1597.

In Syria, the Assassins joined with other Muslim groups to oppose the Mongols and courted the Mamluks and Baibars. Baibars entered into a truce with the Hospitallers in 1266 and stipulated that the tribute paid by the Assassins be halted. The tribute once paid to the Franks was to come instead to Cairo. As early as 1260, Baibars&#x27; biographer ibn Abd al-Zahir reported that he was granting Assassin lands in &quot;iqta&#x27;&quot; to his generals, and in 1265 began to tax the &quot;gifts&quot; the Assassins received from various princes that apparently included Louis IX of France, Rudolph I of Germany, Alphonso X of Castile, and the Rasulid sultan of Yemen al-Muzaffar Yusuf. The Syrian branch of the Assassins was taken over by Baibars by 1270, recognizing the threat of an independent force with his sultanate.

Najm ad-Din was replaced by Baibars&#x27; son-in-law Sarim al-Din Mubarak, governor of al-&#x27;Ullaiqah in 1270. Sarim was soon deposed and sent as a prisoner to Cairo, and Najm ad-Din was restored at chief &quot;da&#x27;i&quot; at Masyaf. His son Shams ad-Din joined him in service, but owing a tribute to the sultan. The next year, in the midst of the siege of Tripoli, two Assassins were sent by Bohemond VI of Antioch, then Count of Tripoli, to murder his attacker Baibars. Shams ad-Din was arrested in the plot, but released when his father argued his case. The Isma&#x27;ili leaders were eventually implicated and agreed to surrender their castles and live at Baibars&#x27; court. Najm ad-Din died in Cairo in 1274.

In 1271, Baibars&#x27; forces seized al-&#x27;Ullaiqah and ar-Rusafa, after taking Masyaf the year before. Later in the year, Shams ad-Din surrendered and was deported to Egypt. Qala&#x27;at al-Khawabi fell that year and within two years Gerdkuh and all of the Assassin fortresses were held by the sultan. With the Assassins under his control, Baibars was able to use them to counter the forces arriving in the Ninth Crusade. The sultan threatened Bohemond VI, and the Assassins attacked future king Edward I of England unsuccessfully with Edward killing the Assassin.

The last known victim of the Assassins was Philip of Montfort, lord of Tyre, long an enemy of Baibars. Philip helped negotiate the truce following the capture of Damietta by Louis IX and had lost the castle at Toron to Baibars in 1266. Despite his advanced age, Philip was murdered by Baibars&#x27; Assassins in 1270.

The last of the Assassin strongholds was al-Kahf in the Syrian coastal mountains in 1273. The Mamluks reportedly continued to use the services of the remaining Assassins, and the 14th-century scholar ibn Battuta reported their fixed rate of pay per murder, with his children getting the fee if the Assassin did not survive the attack. There are, nevertheless, no recorded instances of Assassin activity after the later 13th century. They unremarkably settled near Salamiyah, with a still-large Isma&#x27;ili population that recognizes the Aga Khan as their Imam.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;asas&quot; in Arabic means &quot;principle&quot;. The &quot;Asāsiyyūn&quot; (plural, from literary Arabic) were, as defined in Arabic, the principle people. The term &quot;assassin&quot; likely has roots in &quot;hashshāshīn&quot; (&quot;hashish smokers or users&quot;), a mispronunciation of the original Asāsiyyūn, but not a mispronunciation of &quot;Assasiyeen&quot; (pronounced &quot;Asāsiyyeen&quot;, the plural of &quot;Asasi&quot;). Originally referring to the methods of political control exercised by the Assasiyuun, one can see how it became &quot;assassin&quot; in several languages to describe similar activities anywhere.

The Assassins were finally linked by the 19th-century orientalist Silvestre de Sacy to the Arabic word &quot;hashish&quot; using their variant names &quot;assassin&quot; and &quot;assissini&quot; in the 19th century. Citing the example of one of the first written applications of the Arabic term &quot;hashish&quot; to the Ismailis by 13th-century historian Abu Shama, de Sacy demonstrated its connection to the name given to the Ismailis throughout Western scholarship. Following de Sacy&#x27;s account, various popularizers of the &quot;Hashishi myth&quot; – including self-proclaimed Sufi scholar Idries Shah (who, in fact, never belonged to any Sufi tariqa nor even graduated from any university) – continue to pejoratively describe the Assassins (and, by extension, Ismailis in general) as &#x27;druggers&#x27; who used hashish &quot;in stupefying candidates for the ephemeral visit to &quot;paradise&quot;&quot;. However, the first known usage of the term &quot;hashishi&quot; has been traced back to 1122 when the Fatimid caliph al-Amir bi-Ahkami’l-Lah, himself later assassinated, employed it in derogatory reference to the Syrian. Used figuratively, the term &quot;hashishi&quot; connoted meanings such as outcasts or rabble. Without actually accusing the group of using the hashish drug, the caliph used the term in a pejorative manner. This label was quickly adopted by anti-Isma&#x27;ili historians and applied to the Isma&#x27;ilis of Syria and Persia. The spread of the term was further facilitated through military encounters, whose chroniclers adopted the term and disseminated it across Europe. To Crusaders, the Fedayeen concept of valuing a principle above your own life was alien to them, so they rationalized it using myths such as the &#x27;paradise legend&#x27;, the &#x27;leap of faith&#x27; legend, and the &#x27;hashish legend&#x27;, sewn together in the writings of Marco Polo.

During the medieval period, Western scholarship on the Isma&#x27;ilis contributed to the popular view of the community as a radical sect of assassins, believed to be trained for the precise murder of their adversaries. By the 14th century, European scholarship on the topic had not advanced much beyond the work and tales from the Crusaders. The origins of the word forgotten, across Europe the term assassin had taken the meaning of &quot;professional murderer&quot;. In 1603, the first Western publication on the topic of the Assassins was authored by a court official for King Henry IV of France and was mainly based on the narratives of Marco Polo from his visits to the Near East. While he assembled the accounts of many Western travellers, the author failed to explain the etymology of the term Assassin.

According to the Lebanese writer Amin Maalouf, based on texts from Alamut, Hassan-i Sabbah tended to call his disciples &quot;Asāsīyūn&quot; (, meaning &quot;people who are faithful to the foundation [of the faith]&quot;), and derivation from the term &quot;hashish&quot; is a misunderstanding by foreign travelers.

Another modern author, Edward Burman, states that:
The name &quot;Assassin&quot; is often said to derive from the Arabic word &quot;Hashishin&quot; or &quot;users of hashish&quot;, which was originally applied to the Assassins Isma&#x27;ilis by the rival Mustali Isma&#x27;ilis during the fall of the Isma&#x27;ili Fatimid Empire and the separation of the two Isma&#x27;ili streams. There is little evidence hashish was used to motivate the Assassins, contrary to the beliefs of their Medieval enemies. It is possible that the term &quot;hashishiyya&quot; or &quot;hashishi&quot; in Arabic sources was used metaphorically in its abusive sense relating to use of hashish, which due to its effects on the mind state is outlawed in Islam. Modern versions of this word include &quot;Mahashish&quot; used in the same derogatory sense, albeit less offensive nowadays, as the use of the substance is more widespread. The term hashashin was (and still is) used to describe absent minded criminals and is used derogatorily in all the Muslim sources referring to the Assassins as such.

The Sunni Muslims also used the term &quot;mulhid&quot; to refer to the Assassins, which is also recorded by the traveller and Franciscan William of Rubruck as &quot;&quot;.

==Military tactics==
In pursuit of their religious and political goals, the Isma&#x27;ilis adopted various military strategies popular in the Middle Ages. One such method was that of assassination, the selective elimination of prominent rival figures. The murders of political adversaries were usually carried out in public spaces, creating resounding intimidation for other possible enemies. Throughout history, many groups have resorted to assassination as a means of achieving political ends. The assassinations were committed against those whose elimination would most greatly reduce aggression against the Ismailis and, in particular, against those who had perpetrated massacres against the community. A single assassination was usually employed in contrast with the widespread bloodshed which generally resulted from factional combat. Assassins are also said to have been adept in &quot;furusiyya&quot;, or the Islamic warrior code, where they were trained in combat, disguises, and equestrianism. Codes of conduct were followed, and the Assassins were taught in the art of war, linguistics, and strategies. For about two centuries, the Assassins specialized in assassinating their religious and political enemies.

While the Seljuks and Crusaders both employed murder as a military means of disposing of factional enemies, during the Alamut period almost any murder of political significance in the Islamic lands was attributed to the Isma&#x27;ilis. So inflated had this association grown that, in the work of orientalists such as Bernard Lewis, the Isma&#x27;ilis were equated with the politically active &quot;fida&#x27;i&quot;s and thus were regarded as a radical and heretical sect known as the Assassins.

The military approach of the Assassins Isma&#x27;ili state was largely a defensive one, with strategically chosen sites that appeared to avoid confrontation wherever possible without the loss of life. The defining characteristic of the Assassins Isma&#x27;ili state was that it was scattered geographically throughout Persia and Syria. Alamut Castle therefore was only one of a nexus of strongholds throughout the regions where Isma&#x27;ilis could retreat to safety if necessary. West of Alamut in the Shahrud Valley, the major fortress of Lambsar served as just one example of such a retreat. In the context of their political uprising, the various spaces of Isma&#x27;ili military presence took on the name &quot;dar al-hijra&quot; (; land of migration, place of refuge). The notion of the &quot;dar al-hijra&quot; originates from the time of Muhammad, who migrated with his followers from persecution to a safe haven in &quot;Yathrib&quot; (Medina). In this way, the Fatimids found their &quot;dar al-hijra&quot; in North Africa. From 1101 to 1118, attacks and sieges were made on the fortresses, conducted by combined forces of the Seljuks Berkyaruq and Ahmad Sanjar. Although with the cost of lives and the capture and execution of Assassin &quot;da&#x27;i&quot; Ahmad ibn Attash, the Assassins managed to hold their ground and repel the attacks until the Mongol invasion. Likewise, during the revolt against the Seljuks, several fortresses served as spaces of refuge for the Isma&#x27;ilis.

Marco Polo recounts the following method how the Hashashin were recruited for jihad and assassinations on behalf of their master in Alamut:

“He was named Alo−eddin, and his religion was that of Mahomet. In a beautiful valley enclosed between two lofty mountains, he had formed a luxurious garden, stored with every delicious fruit and every fragrant shrub that could be procured. Palaces of various sizes and forms were erected in different parts of the grounds, ornamented with works in gold, with paintings, and with furniture of rich silks. By means of small conduits contrived in these buildings, streams of wine, milk, honey, and some of pure water, were seen to flow in every direction. The inhabitants of these palaces were elegant and beautiful damsels, accomplished in the arts of singing, playing upon all sorts of musical instruments, dancing, and especially those of dalliance and amorous allurement. Clothed in rich dresses they were seen continually sporting and amusing themselves in the garden and pavilions, their female guardians being confined within doors and never suffered to appear. The object which the chief had in view in forming a garden of this fascinating kind, was this: that Mahomet having promised to those who should obey his will the enjoyments of Paradise, where every species of sensual gratification should be found, in the society of beautiful nymphs, he was desirous of its being understood by his followers that he also was a prophet and the compeer of Mahomet, and had the power of admitting to Paradise such as he should choose to favor. In order that none without his licence might find their way into this delicious valley, he caused a strong and inexpugnable castle to be erected at the opening of it, through which the entry was by a secret passage. At his court, likewise, this chief entertained a number of youths, from the age of twelve to twenty years, selected from the inhabitants of the surrounding mountains, who showed a disposition for martial exercises, and appeared to possess the quality of daring courage. To them he was in the daily practice of discoursing on the subject of the paradise announced by the prophet, and of his own power of granting admission; and at certain times he caused opium to be administered to ten or a dozen of the youths; and when half dead with sleep he had them conveyed to the several apartments of the palaces in the garden. Upon awakening from this state of lethargy, their senses were struck with all the delightful objects that have been described, and each perceived himself surrounded by lovely damsels, singing, playing, and attracting his regards by the most fascinating caresses, serving him also with delicate viands and exquisite wines; until intoxicated with excess of enjoyment amidst actual rivulets of milk and wine, he believed himself assuredly in Paradise, and felt an unwillingness to relinquish its delights. When four or five days had thus been passed, they were thrown once more into a state of somnolency, and carried out of the garden. Upon their being introduced to his presence, and questioned by him as to where they had been, their answer was, “In Paradise, through the favor of your highness:” and then before the whole court, who listened to them with eager curiosity and astonishment, they gave a circumstantial account of the scenes to which they had been witnesses. The chief thereupon addressing them, said: “We have the assurances of our prophet that he who defends his lord shall inherit Paradise, and if you show yourselves devoted to the obedience of my orders, that happy lot awaits you.” Animated to enthusiasm by words of this nature, all deemed themselves happy to receive the commands of their master, and were forward to die in his service. 5 The consequence of this system was, that when any of the neighboring princes, or others, gave umbrage to this chief, they were put to death by these his disciplined assassins; none of whom felt terror at the risk of losing their own lives, which they held in little estimation, provided they could execute their master&#x27;s will.”

During the mid-12th century the Assassins captured or acquired several fortresses in the Nusayriyah Mountain Range in coastal Syria, including Masyaf, Rusafa, al-Kahf, al-Qadmus, Khawabi, Sarmin, Quliya, Ulayqa, Maniqa, and Abu Qubays. For the most part, the Assassins maintained full control over these fortresses until 1270–1273 when the Mamluk sultan Baibars annexed them. Most were dismantled afterwards, while those at Masyaf and Ulayqa were later rebuilt. From then on, the Ismailis maintained limited autonomy over those former strongholds as loyal subjects of the Mamluks.

==Legends and folklore==

The legends of the Assassins had much to do with the training and instruction of Assassins &quot;fida&#x27;i&quot;s, famed for their public missions during which they often gave their lives to eliminate adversaries. Some historians have contributed to the tales of &quot;fida&#x27;i&quot;s being fed with hashish as part of their training, but these are only, in reference to the travels of Marco Polo and polemics by enemies. Scholars including Vladimir Ivanov purport that the assassinations of key figures including Seljuk vizier al-Mulk likely provided encouraging impetus to others in the community who sought to secure the Assassins&#x27; protection from political aggression. Originally a &quot;local and popular term&quot; first applied to the Isma&#x27;ilis of Syria, the label was orally transmitted to Western historians and thus found itself in their histories of the Assassins.

It is unknown how Hassan-i-Sabbah was able to get the Assassins to perform with such fervent loyalty. One theory, possibly the best known but also the most criticized, comes from the reports of Marco Polo during his travels to the Orient. He recounts a story he heard that Muhammad III of Alamut would drug his young followers with hashish, lead them to a &quot;paradise&quot;, and then claim that only he had the means to allow for their return. Perceiving that Muhammad III was either a prophet or magician, his disciples, believing that only he could return them to &quot;paradise&quot;, were fully committed to his cause and willing to carry out his every request.

The tales of the &quot;fida&#x27;i&quot;s″ training collected from anti-Ismaili historians and orientalist writers were compounded and compiled in Marco Polo&#x27;s account, in which he described a &quot;secret garden of paradise&quot;. After being drugged, the Ismaili devotees were said to be taken to a paradise-like garden filled with attractive young maidens and beautiful plants in which these &quot;fida&#x27;i&quot;s would awaken. Here, they were told by an &quot;old&quot; man that they were witnessing their place in Paradise and that should they wish to return to this garden permanently, they must serve the Assassins cause. So went the tale of the &quot;Old Man in the Mountain&quot;, assembled by Marco Polo and accepted by Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall, an 18th-century Austrian orientalist writer responsible for much of the spread of this legend. Until the 1930s, von Hammer&#x27;s retelling of the Assassin legends served as the standard account of the Assassins across Europe.

A well-known legend tells how Count Henry II of Champagne, returning from Armenia, spoke with Grand Master Rashid ad-Din Sinan at al-Kahf. The count claimed to have the most powerful army and at any moment he claimed he could defeat the Hashashin, because his army was 10 times larger. Rashid replied that his army was instead the most powerful, and to prove it he told one of his men to jump off from the top of the castle in which they were staying. The man did. Surprised, the count immediately recognized that Rashid&#x27;s army was indeed the strongest, because it did everything at his command, and Rashid further gained the count&#x27;s respect.

The Ismaili were part of the Durbar of the Great Mogul (emperor), with high-ranking members of their community possibly called Khoja. Their community including the other communities of Islam in South Asia had become leaderless after the year 1857 when the Mughal Empire was abolished.

The Ismaili began settling in Bombay when the British Raj had established itself.

Modern works on the Assassins have elucidated their history and, in doing so, dispelled popular histories from the past as mere legends. In 1933, under the direction of the Imam Sultan Muhammad Shah, Aga Khan III, the Islamic Research Association was developed. Historian Vladimir Ivanov was central to both this institution and the 1946 Ismaili Society of Bombay. Cataloguing a number of Ismaili texts, Ivanov provided the ground for great strides in modern Isma&#x27;ili scholarship.

Ismaili leaders would later support the cause of Pakistan during the partition and have a considerable presence in that country.

In recent years, Peter Willey has provided interesting evidence that goes against the Assassin folklore of earlier scholars. Drawing on its established esoteric doctrine, Willey asserts that the Ismaili understanding of Paradise is a deeply symbolic one. While the Qur&#x27;anic description of Heaven includes natural imagery, Willey argues that no Assassins &quot;fida&#x27;i&quot; would seriously believe that he was witnessing Paradise simply by awakening in a beauteous garden. The Assassins&#x27; symbolic interpretation of the Qur&#x27;anic description of Paradise serves as evidence against the possibility of such an exotic garden used as motivation for the devotees to carry out their armed missions. Furthermore, Willey points out that a courtier of Hulagu Khan, Juvayni, surveyed the Alamut castle just before the Mongol invasion. In his reports about the fortress, there are elaborate descriptions of sophisticated storage facilities and the famous Alamut library. However, even this anti-Ismaili historian makes no mention of the gardens on the Alamut grounds. Having destroyed a number of texts in the library&#x27;s collection which he deemed to be heretical, it would be expected that Juvayni would pay significant attention to the Assassins&#x27; gardens, particularly if they were the site of drug use and temptation. Having not once mentioned such gardens, Willey concludes that there is no sound evidence in favor of these legends.

==In popular culture==
The Assassins were part of Medieval culture, and they were either demonized or romanticized. The Hashashin frequently appeared in the art and literature of the Middle Ages. Sometimes, they were portrayed as one of the knight&#x27;s archenemies, and they were also portrayed as a quintessential villain during the crusades.

The word Assassin, in variant forms, had already passed into European usage as a term for a hired professional murderer in this general sense. The Italian chronicler Giovanni Villani, who died in 1348, tells how the lord of Lucca sent &#x27;his assassins&#x27; (i suoi assassini) to Pisa to kill a troublesome enemy there. Even earlier, Dante, in a passing reference in the 19th canto of the &quot;Inferno&quot;, completed in 1320, speaks of &#x27;the treacherous assassin&#x27; (lo perfido assassin); his fourteenth-century commentator Francesco da Buti, explaining a term which for some readers at the time may still have been strange and obscure, remarks: &#x27;Assassino è colui che uccide altrui per danari&#x27; (An assassin is one who kills others for money).

The most widespread awareness of the Assassins in modern Europe, and their incorporation into the Romantic tradition, was created by the Austrian historian and Orientalist Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall in his 1818 book, &quot;Die Geschichte der Assassinen aus morgenländischen Quellen&quot; (translated into English in 1835 as &quot;The History of the Assassins&quot;). This work was the standard one on the history of the Assassins in the West until the 1930s.

The Assassins appear in many role-playing games and video games, especially in massively multiplayer online games, in addition to shows and books. The assassin character class is a common feature of many such games, usually specializing in single combat and stealth skills, often combined in order to defeat an opponent without exposing the assassin to counter-attack.

* The &quot;Exile&quot; series of action role-playing games revolves around a time-traveling Syrian Assassin who assassinates various religious historical figures and modern world leaders.
* The &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; video game series portrays a heavily fictionalized Ḥashshāshīn order, which has expanded beyond its Levantine confines and is depicted as having existed throughout recorded history (along with their nemesis, the Knights Templar). Both orders are portrayed as fundamentally philosophical orders, rather than religious orders, in nature, and they are expressly said to predate the faiths that their real-life counterparts arose from, thus allowing their respective &quot;histories&quot; to be expanded, both before and after their factual time-frames. In addition, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; draws much of its content from historical facts, and incorporates the purported last words of Hassan i Sabbah as the actual creed (&quot;Nothing is true; everything is permitted&quot;); the sources of that quote are largely unreliable. Since its release, the series has developed into a franchise which consists of novels, comic books, video games, manga, board games, short films and a theatrically released movie.
* In the &quot;Sword of Islam&quot; DLC for Paradox Interactive&#x27;s grand strategy game &quot;Crusader Kings II&quot;, the Hashashin are a holy order associated with Shi&#x27;a Islam. Once established, Shi&#x27;ite rulers may hire the Hashashin to fight against non-Shi&#x27;a realms, and can potentially vassalize them. The &quot;Monks and Mystics&quot; DLC expands their role, making the Assassins a unique secret society that Shi&#x27;a characters may join.
* In the Netflix series &quot;Marco Polo&quot;, the emperor Kublai Khan is attacked by a group of assassins, the Hashshashin, who are led by the Old Man of the Mountain, according to the Taoist monk Hundred Eyes, in the King&#x27;s court. The Old Man of the Mountain is then pursued by Marco Polo and Byamba. The episode Hashshashin (2014) shows how the Old Man leads Marco Polo into a hallucinogenic state.
* Louis L&#x27;Amour, in his book &quot;The Walking Drum&quot;, used the assassins and the stronghold of Alamut as the location of his main character&#x27;s enslaved father. Mathurin Kerbouchard, who initially seeks his father in the 12th-century Moor-controlled Spain, then throughout Europe, must ultimately travel to the Stronghold of Alamut in order to rescue Jean Kerbouchard.
* Many of Terry Pratchett&#x27;s Discworld series of fantasy novels are set in the fictional city of Ankh-Morpork, where crime has become officially regulated by being organised into a number of guilds, including a Guild of Assassins. In most of the novels, the city is led by the autocrat Patrician Lord Vetinari, who began his career as a member of the Assassins Guild.
* The Faceless men, a guild of assassins in the book series &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; by George R. R. Martin and in the TV series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; are inspired by the Order of Assassins.
* Dota 2, multiplayer online battle arena contains a character named &quot;Lanaya&quot;, who is described as a &quot;Templar Assassin&quot;.
*There are various Assassin class Servants who go by the name of &quot;Hassan-i Sabbah&quot; in the &quot;Fate/stay night&quot; anime-and-visual novel-franchise. It is established that &quot;Hassan-i-Sabbah&quot; is a title used by each of the nineteen leaders of the Hashshashin. The founder of the Order, identified as the &quot;First Hassan&quot;, appears in &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot; with the title of &quot;Grand Assassin&quot; due to being the origin of the word itself.
*In Batman comics and related media, the League of Assassins is a fictional offshoot of the Order of Assassins that has survived clandestinely into modern times under the immortal DC Comics supervillain Ra&#x27;s al Ghul.
*In the Turkish television series &quot;Uyanış: Büyük Selçuklu&quot;, the Order of Assassins and Hassan-i Sabbah are shown as villains who are the enemies of the Seljuk Empire and Malik-Shah I.
*The book &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot; by Dan Brown has a modern-day descendant of the Hassassin as a major character.
*In Umberto Eco&#x27;s &quot;Baudolino&quot;, a group of adventurers at the centre of the story are enslaved by the Old Man of the Mountain, being drugged, shown paradise, and serving the order for years before escaping.
*In the Egyptian television series Ḥashāshīn (in English: The Assassins).

<text>Colorless green ideas sleep furiously was composed by Noam Chomsky in his 1957 book &quot;Syntactic Structures&quot; as an example of a sentence that is grammatically well-formed, but semantically nonsensical. The sentence was originally used in his 1955 thesis &quot;The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory&quot; and in his 1956 paper &quot;Three Models for the Description of Language&quot;. There is no obvious understandable meaning that can be derived from it, which demonstrates the distinction between syntax and semantics, and the idea that a syntactically well-formed sentence is not guaranteed to also be semantically well-formed. As an example of a category mistake, it was intended to show the inadequacy of certain probabilistic models of grammar, and the need for more structured models.

==Senseless but grammatical==
Chomsky wrote in his 1957 book &quot;Syntactic Structures&quot;: 

It is fair to assume that neither sentence (1) nor (2) had ever previously occurred in an English discourse. Hence, in any statistical model that accounts for grammaticality, these sentences will be ruled out on identical grounds as equally &quot;remote&quot; from English. Yet (1), though nonsensical, is grammatical, while (2) is not grammatical.

&quot;Colorless green ideas&quot; – which functions as the subject of the sentence – is an anomalous string for at least two reasons:

* The adjective &quot;colorless&quot; can be understood as dull, uninteresting, or lacking in color, and so when it combines with the adjective &quot;green&quot;, this is nonsensical: an object cannot simultaneously lack color and have the color of green.
* In the phrase &quot;colorless green ideas&quot; the abstract noun &quot;idea&quot; is described as being colorless and green. However, due to its abstract nature, an idea cannot have or lack color.

&quot;Sleep furiously&quot; – which functions as the predicate of the sentence – is structurally well-formed; in other words, it is grammatical. However, the meaning that it expresses is peculiar, as the activity of sleeping is not generally taken to be something that can be done in a furious fashion. Nevertheless, &quot;sleep furiously&quot; is both grammatical and interpretable, though its interpretation is unusual.

Combining &quot;Colorless green ideas&quot; with &quot;sleep furiously&quot; creates a sentence that some believe to be nonsensical. On the one hand, an abstract noun like &quot;idea&quot; is taken to not have the ability to engage in an activity like sleeping. On the other hand, some think it possible for an idea to sleep.

Linguists account for the unusual nature of this sentence by distinguishing two types of selection: semantic selection (s-selection) and categorical selection (c-selection). Relative to s-selection, the sentence is semantically anomalous – senseless – for three reasons:

* The s-selection of the adjective &quot;colorless&quot; is violated because it can only describe objects that lack color.
* The s-selection of the adverb &quot;furiously&quot; is violated because it can only describe activity that is compatible with angry action, and such meanings are generally incompatible with the activity of sleeping.
* The s-selection of the verb &quot;sleep&quot; is violated because it can occur only with subjects that can engage in sleep.

However, relative to c-selection, the sentence is structurally well-formed:

* The c-selection of the adverb &quot;furiously&quot; is satisfied, as it combines with the verb &quot;sleep&quot;, satisfying the requirement that an adverb modifies a verb.
* The c-selection of the adjectives &quot;colorless&quot; and &quot;green&quot; are satisfied as they combine with noun &quot;idea&quot;, satisfying the requirement that an adjective modifies a noun.
* The c-selection of the intransitive verb &quot;sleep&quot; is satisfied as it combines with the subject &quot;colorless green ideas&quot;, satisfying the requirement that an intransitive verb combines with a subject.

This leads to the conclusion that although meaningless, the structural integrity of this sentence is high.

==Attempts at meaningful interpretations==

===Polysemy===
The mechanism of polysemy – where a word has multiple meanings – can be used to create an interpretation for an otherwise non-sensical sentence. For example, the adjectives &quot;green&quot; and &quot;colorless&quot; both have figurative meanings. &quot;Green&quot; has a wide range of figurative meanings, including &quot;immature&quot;, &quot;pertaining to environmental consciousness&quot;, &quot;newly formed&quot;, and &quot;naive&quot;. And &quot;colorless&quot; can be interpreted as &quot;nondescript&quot;. Likewise the verb &quot;sleep&quot; can have the figurative meaning of &quot;being in dormant state&quot;, and the adverb &quot;furiously&quot; can have the figurative meaning &quot;to do an action violently or quickly&quot;.

* figurative meanings of &quot;colorless&quot;: nondescript, unseen, drab
* figurative meanings of &quot;green&quot;: immature, pertaining to environmental consciousness, newly formed, naive, jealous
* figurative meanings of &quot;sleep&quot;: be in a dormant state
* figurative meanings of &quot;furiously&quot;: to do an action quickly, vigorously, intensely, energetically or violently

When these figurative meanings are taken into account the sentence &quot;Colorless green ideas sleep furiously&quot; can have legitimate meaning, with less oblique semantics, and so is compatible with the following interpretations:

# &quot;Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.&quot;= &quot;Nondescript immature ideas have violent nightmares.&quot;
# &quot;Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.&quot;= &quot;Naive ideas which have not yet attained their full scope can cause a mind to race even while it attempts to rest&quot;
# &quot;Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.=&quot; &quot;Suppressed envious ideas lie dormant, though the negative feelings intensify&quot;

===In popular culture===
Chomsky&#x27;s &quot;colorless green&quot; inspired written works, which all try to create meaning from the semantically meaningless utterance through added context. In 1958, linguist and anthropologist Dell Hymes presented his work to show that nonsense words can develop into something meaningful when in the right sequence.

Russian-American linguist and literary theorist Roman Jakobson (1959) interpreted &quot;colorless green&quot; as a pale green, and &quot;sleep furiously&quot; as the wildness of &quot;a state-like sleep, as that of inertness, torpidity, numbness.&quot; Jakobson gave the example that if &quot;[someone&#x27;s] hatred never slept, why then, cannot someone&#x27;s ideas fall into sleep?&quot; John Hollander, an American poet and literary critic, argued that the sentence operates in a vacuum as it is without context. He went on to write a poem based on that idea, entitled &quot;Coiled Alizarine&quot; that was included in his book, &quot;The Night Mirror&quot; (1971).

Years later, Hollander contacted Chomsky about whether the color choice of &#x27;green&#x27; was intentional; however, Chomsky denied any intentions or influences, especially the hypothesized influence from Andrew Marvell&#x27;s lines from &quot;The Garden&quot; (1681). 

One of the first writers to have attempted to provide the sentence meaning through context is Chinese linguist Yuen Ren Chao (1997). Chao&#x27;s poem, entitled &quot;Making Sense Out of Nonsense: The Story of My Friend Whose &quot;Colorless Green Ideas Sleep Furiously&quot; (after Noam Chomsky)&quot; was published in 1971. This poem attempts to explain what &quot;colorless green ideas&quot; are and how they are able to &quot;sleep furiously&quot;. Chao interprets &quot;colorless&quot; as plain, &quot;green&quot; as unripened, and &quot;sleep furiously&quot; as putting the ideas to rest; sleeping on them overnight whilst having internal conflict with these ideas.

British linguist Angus McIntosh was unable to accept that Chomsky&#x27;s utterance was entirely meaningless because to him, &quot;colorless green ideas may well sleep furiously&quot;. As if to prove that the sentences are in fact meaningful, McIntosh wrote two poems influenced by Chomsky&#x27;s utterance, one of which was entitled &quot;Nightmare I&quot;.

===Stanford 1985 competition===
In 1985, a literary competition was held at Stanford University in which the contestants were invited to make Chomsky&#x27;s sentence meaningful using not more than 100 words of prose or 14 lines of verse.

An example entry from the competition, by C. M. Street, is:
===Experimental usage===
Research has been done by implementing this into conversations on text. Research led by Bruno Galantucci at Yeshiva University has implemented the meaningless sentence into real conversations to test reactions. They ran 30 conversations with 1 male and 1 female slipping &quot;colorless green ideas sleep furiously&quot; eight minutes into the conversation during silence. After the conversation, the experimenters did a post-conversation questionnaire, mainly asking if they thought the conversation was unusual. Galantucci concluded that there was a trend of &quot;insensitivity&quot; to conversational coherence. 

There are two general theories that were garnered from this experiment. The first theory is that people tend to ignore the inconsistency of speech to protect the quality of the conversation. In particular, face-to-face conversation has a 33.33% lower detection rate of nonsensical sentences than online messaging. The authors further explain how humans often disregard some contents of every conversation. The second theory the authors deduced is that effective communication may be subconsciously undermined when dealing with &quot;conversational&quot; coherence. These conclusions support the idea that phatic communication plays a key role in social life.

==Statistical challenges==
Since the 1950s, the field has used techniques more in line with Chomsky&#x27;s approach. However, this all changed in the mid-1980s, when researchers started to experiment with statistical models, convincing over 90% of the researchers in the field to switch to statistical approaches.

In 2000, Fernando Pereira of the University of Pennsylvania fitted a simple statistical Markov model to a body of newspaper text, and showed that under this model, &quot;Furiously sleep ideas green colorless&quot; is about 200,000 times less probable than &quot;Colorless green ideas sleep furiously&quot;.

This statistical model defines a similarity metric, whereby sentences which are more like those within a corpus in certain respects are assigned higher values than sentences less alike. Pereira&#x27;s model assigns an ungrammatical version of the same sentence a lower probability than the syntactically well-formed structure demonstrating that statistical models can identify variations in grammaticality with minimal linguistic assumptions. However, it is not clear that the model assigns every ungrammatical sentence a lower probability than every grammatical sentence. That is, &quot;colorless green ideas sleep furiously&quot; may still be statistically more &quot;remote&quot; from English than some ungrammatical sentences. To this, it may be argued that &quot;no&quot; current theory of grammar is capable of distinguishing &quot;all&quot; grammatical English sentences from ungrammatical ones.

==Related and similar examples==
=== In other languages ===
The French syntactician Lucien Tesnière came up with the French language sentence &quot;Le silence vertébral indispose la voile licite&quot; (&quot;The vertebral silence indisposes the licit sail&quot;). He also compared the following two sentences to demonstrate the contrast between syntax and meaning:

* le signal vert indique le voie libre (&quot;the green signal indicates the clear way&quot;)
* le symbole veritable impose le vitesse lissant (&quot;the real symbol imposes the smoothing speed&quot;)

As he described, &quot;la syntaxe. Il est autonome&quot;.

In Russian schools of linguistics, the &quot;glokaya kuzdra&quot; example has similar characteristics.

=== In games ===
The game of &quot;exquisite corpse&quot; is a method for generating nonsense sentences. It was named after the first sentence generated in the game in 1925: &quot;Le cadavre exquis boira le vin nouveau&quot; (the exquisite corpse will drink the new wine).

In the popular game of &quot;Mad Libs&quot;, a chosen player asks each other player to provide parts of speech without providing any contextual information (e.g., &quot;Give me a proper noun&quot;, or &quot;Give me an adjective&quot;), and these words are inserted into pre-composed sentences with a correct grammatical structure, but in which certain words have been omitted. The humor of the game is in the generation of sentences which are grammatical but which are meaningless or have absurd or ambiguous meanings (such as &#x27;loud sharks&#x27;). The game also tends to generate humorous double entendres.

=== In philosophy ===
There are likely earlier examples of such sentences, possibly from the philosophy of language literature, but not necessarily uncontroversial ones, given that the focus has been mostly on borderline cases. For example, followers of logical positivism hold that &quot;metaphysical&quot; (i.e. not empirically verifiable) statements are simply meaningless; e.g. Rudolf Carnap wrote an article in which he argued that almost every sentence from Heidegger was grammatically well-formed, yet meaningless.

The philosopher Bertrand Russell used the sentence &quot;Quadruplicity drinks procrastination&quot; in his &quot;An Inquiry into Meaning and Truth&quot; from 1940, to make a similar point; W.V. Quine took issue with him on the grounds that for a sentence to be false is nothing more than for it not to be true; and since quadruplicity does not drink &quot;anything&quot;, the sentence is simply false, not meaningless.

Other arguably &quot;meaningless&quot; utterances are ones that make sense, are grammatical, but have no reference to the present state of the world, such as Russell&#x27;s &quot;The present King of France is bald&quot; (France does not presently have a king) from &quot;On Denoting&quot; (also see definite description).

=== In literature and entertainment ===
Another approach is to create a syntactically-well-formed, easily parsable sentence using nonsense words; a famous such example is &quot;The gostak distims the doshes&quot;. Lewis Carroll&#x27;s Jabberwocky is also famous for using this technique, although in this case for literary purposes; similar sentences used in neuroscience experiments are called Jabberwocky sentences.

In a sketch about linguistics, British comedy duo Fry and Laurie used the nonsensical sentence &quot;Hold the newsreader&#x27;s nose squarely, waiter, or friendly milk will countermand my trousers.&quot;

The &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Darmok&quot; features a race that communicates entirely by referencing folklore and stories. While the vessel&#x27;s universal translator correctly translates the characters and places from these stories, it fails to decipher the intended meaning, leaving Captain Picard unable to understand the alien.

<text>Philosophy of mathematics is the branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of mathematics and its relationship to other areas of philosophy, particularly epistemology and metaphysics. Central questions posed include whether or not mathematical objects are purely abstract entities or are in some way concrete, and in what the relationship such objects have with physical reality consists.

Major themes that are dealt with in philosophy of mathematics include:
*&quot;Reality&quot;: The question is whether mathematics is a pure product of human mind or whether it has some reality by itself.
*&quot;Logic and rigor&quot;
*&quot;Relationship with physical reality&quot;
*&quot;Relationship with science&quot;
*&quot;Relationship with applications&quot;
*&quot;Mathematical truth&quot;
*&quot;Nature as human activity&quot; (science, art, game, or all together)

==Major themes==
===Reality===
=== Logic and rigor ===
Mathematical reasoning requires rigor. This means that the definitions must be absolutely unambiguous and the proofs must be reducible to a succession of applications of syllogisms or inference rules, without any use of empirical evidence and intuition.

The rules of rigorous reasoning have been established by the ancient Greek philosophers under the name of &quot;logic&quot;. Logic is not specific to mathematics, but, in mathematics, the standard of rigor is much higher than elsewhere.

For many centuries, logic, although used for mathematical proofs, belonged to philosophy and was not specifically studied by mathematicians. Circa the end of the 19th century, several paradoxes made questionable the logical foundation of mathematics, and consequently the validity of the whole of mathematics. This has been called the foundational crisis of mathematics. Some of these paradoxes consist of results that seem to contradict the common intuition, such as the possibility to construct valid non-Euclidean geometries in which the parallel postulate is wrong, the Weierstrass function that is continuous but nowhere differentiable, and the study by Georg Cantor of infinite sets, which led to consider several sizes of infinity (infinite cardinals). Even more striking, Russell&#x27;s paradox shows that the phrase &quot;the set of all sets&quot; is self contradictory.

Several methods have been proposed to solve the problem by changing of logical framework, such as constructive mathematics and intuitionistic logic. Roughly speaking, the first one consists of requiring that every existence theorem must provide an explicit example, and the second one excludes from mathematical reasoning the law of excluded middle and double negation elimination. 

These logics have less inference rules than classical logic. On the other hand classical logic was a first order logic, which means roughly that quantifiers cannot be applied to infinite sets. This means, for example that the sentence &quot;every set of natural numbers has a least element&quot; is nonsensical in any formalization of classical logic. This led to the introduction of higher-order logics, which are presently used commonly in mathematics,

The problems of foundation of mathematics has been eventually resolved with the rise of mathematical logic as a new area of mathematics. In this framework, a mathematical or logical theory consists of a formal language that defines the well-formed of assertions, a set of basic assertions called axioms and a set of inference rules that allow producing new assertions from one or several known assertions. A &quot;theorem&quot; of such a theory is either an axiom or an assertion that can be obtained from previously known theorems by the application of an inference rule. The Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice, generally called &quot;ZFC&quot;, is a higher-order logic in which all mathematics have been restated; it is used implicitely in all mathematics texts that do not specify explicitly on which foundations they are based. Moreover, the other proposed foundations can be modeled and studied inside ZFC.

It results that &quot;rigor&quot; is no more a relevant concept in mathematics, as a proof is either correct or erroneous, and a &quot;rigorous proof&quot; is simply a pleonasm. Where a special concept of rigor comes into play is in the socialized aspects of a proof. In particular, proofs are rarely written in full details, and some steps of a proof are generally considered as &quot;trivial&quot;, &quot;easy&quot;, or &quot;straightforward&quot;, and therefore left to the reader. As most proof errors occur in these skipped steps, a new proof requires to be verified by other specialists of the subject, and can be considered as reliable only after having been accepted by the community of the specialists, which may need several years.

Also, the concept of &quot;rigor&quot; may remain useful for teaching to beginners what is a mathematical proof.

=== Relationship with sciences ===
Mathematics is used in most sciences for modeling phenomena, which then allows predictions to be made from experimental laws. The independence of mathematical truth from any experimentation implies that the accuracy of such predictions depends only on the adequacy of the model. Inaccurate predictions, rather than being caused by invalid mathematical concepts, imply the need to change the mathematical model used. For example, the perihelion precession of Mercury could only be explained after the emergence of Einstein&#x27;s general relativity, which replaced Newton&#x27;s law of gravitation as a better mathematical model.

There is still a philosophical debate whether mathematics is a science. However, in practice, mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists, and mathematics shares much in common with the physical sciences. Like them, it is falsifiable, which means in mathematics that if a result or a theory is wrong, this can be proved by providing a counterexample. Similarly as in science, theories and results (theorems) are often obtained from experimentation. In mathematics, the experimentation may consist of computation on selected examples or of the study of figures or other representations of mathematical objects (often mind representations without physical support). For example, when asked how he came about his theorems, Gauss once replied &quot;durch planmässiges Tattonieren&quot; (through systematic experimentation). However, some authors emphasize that mathematics differs from the modern notion of science by not on empirical evidence.
==== Unreasonable effectiveness ====

The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics is a phenomenon that was named and first made explicit by physicist Eugene Wigner. It is the fact that many mathematical theories (even the &quot;purest&quot;) have applications outside their initial object. These applications may be completely outside their initial area of mathematics, and may concern physical phenomena that were completely unknown when the mathematical theory was introduced. Examples of unexpected applications of mathematical theories can be found in many areas of mathematics.

A notable example is the prime factorization of natural numbers that was discovered more than 2,000 years before its common use for secure internet communications through the RSA cryptosystem. A second historical example is the theory of ellipses. They were studied by the ancient Greek mathematicians as conic sections (that is, intersections of cones with planes). It is almost 2,000 years later that Johannes Kepler discovered that the trajectories of the planets are ellipses.

In the 19th century, the internal development of geometry (pure mathematics) led to definition and study of non-Euclidean geometries, spaces of dimension higher than three and manifolds. At this time, these concepts seemed totally disconnected from the physical reality, but at the beginning of the 20th century, Albert Einstein developed the theory of relativity that uses fundamentally these concepts. In particular, spacetime of special relativity is a non-Euclidean space of dimension four, and spacetime of general relativity is a (curved) manifold of dimension four.

A striking aspect of the interaction between mathematics and physics is when mathematics drives research in physics. This is illustrated by the discoveries of the positron and the baryon formula_1 In both cases, the equations of the theories had unexplained solutions, which led to conjecture of the existence of an unknown particle, and the search for these particles. In both cases, these particles were discovered a few years later by specific experiments.

==History==

The origin of mathematics is of arguments and disagreements. Whether the birth of mathematics was by chance or induced by necessity during the development of similar subjects, such as physics, remains an area of contention.

Many thinkers have contributed their ideas concerning the nature of mathematics. Today, some philosophers of mathematics aim to give accounts of this form of inquiry and its products as they stand, while others emphasize a role for themselves that goes beyond simple interpretation to critical analysis. There are traditions of mathematical philosophy in both Western philosophy and Eastern philosophy. Western philosophies of mathematics go as far back as Pythagoras, who described the theory &quot;everything is mathematics&quot; (mathematicism), Plato, who paraphrased Pythagoras, and studied the ontological status of mathematical objects, and Aristotle, who studied logic and issues related to infinity (actual versus potential).

Greek philosophy on mathematics was strongly influenced by their study of geometry. For example, at one time, the Greeks held the opinion that 1 (one) was not a number, but rather a unit of arbitrary length. A number was defined as a multitude. Therefore, 3, for example, represented a certain multitude of units, and was thus &quot;truly&quot; a number. At another point, a similar argument was made that 2 was not a number but a fundamental notion of a pair. These views come from the heavily geometric straight-edge-and-compass viewpoint of the Greeks: just as lines drawn in a geometric problem are measured in proportion to the first arbitrarily drawn line, so too are the numbers on a number line measured in proportion to the arbitrary first &quot;number&quot; or &quot;one&quot;.

These earlier Greek ideas of numbers were later upended by the discovery of the irrationality of the square root of two. Hippasus, a disciple of Pythagoras, showed that the diagonal of a unit square was incommensurable with its (unit-length) edge: in other words he proved there was no existing (rational) number that accurately depicts the proportion of the diagonal of the unit square to its edge. This caused a significant re-evaluation of Greek philosophy of mathematics. According to legend, fellow Pythagoreans were so traumatized by this discovery that they murdered Hippasus to stop him from spreading his heretical idea. Simon Stevin was one of the first in Europe to challenge Greek ideas in the 16th century. Beginning with Leibniz, the focus shifted strongly to the relationship between mathematics and logic. This perspective dominated the philosophy of mathematics through the time of Boole, Frege and Russell, but was brought into question by developments in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

===Contemporary philosophy===
A perennial issue in the philosophy of mathematics concerns the relationship between logic and mathematics at their joint foundations. While 20th-century philosophers continued to ask the questions mentioned at the outset of this article, the philosophy of mathematics in the 20th century was characterized by a predominant interest in formal logic, set theory (both naive set theory and axiomatic set theory), and foundational issues.

It is a profound puzzle that on the one hand mathematical truths seem to have a compelling inevitability, but on the other hand the source of their &quot;truthfulness&quot; remains elusive. Investigations into this issue are known as the foundations of mathematics program.

At the start of the 20th century, philosophers of mathematics were already beginning to divide into various schools of thought about all these questions, broadly distinguished by their pictures of mathematical epistemology and ontology. Three schools, formalism, intuitionism, and logicism, emerged at this time, partly in response to the increasingly widespread worry that mathematics as it stood, and analysis in particular, did not live up to the standards of certainty and rigor that had been taken for granted. Each school addressed the issues that came to the fore at that time, either attempting to resolve them or claiming that mathematics is not entitled to its status as our most trusted knowledge.

Surprising and counter-intuitive developments in formal logic and set theory early in the 20th century led to new questions concerning what was traditionally called the &quot;foundations of mathematics&quot;. As the century unfolded, the initial focus of concern expanded to an open exploration of the fundamental axioms of mathematics, the axiomatic approach having been taken for granted since the time of Euclid around 300 BCE as the natural basis for mathematics. Notions of axiom, proposition and proof, as well as the notion of a proposition being true of a mathematical object , were formalized, allowing them to be treated mathematically. The Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms for set theory were formulated which provided a conceptual framework in which much mathematical discourse would be interpreted. In mathematics, as in physics, new and unexpected ideas had arisen and significant changes were coming. With Gödel numbering, propositions could be interpreted as referring to themselves or other propositions, enabling inquiry into the consistency of mathematical theories. This reflective critique in which the theory under review &quot;becomes itself the object of a mathematical study&quot; led Hilbert to call such study &quot;metamathematics&quot; or &quot;proof theory&quot;.

At the middle of the century, a new mathematical theory was created by Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane, known as category theory, and it became a new contender for the natural language of mathematical thinking. As the 20th century progressed, however, philosophical opinions diverged as to just how well-founded were the questions about foundations that were raised at the century&#x27;s beginning. Hilary Putnam summed up one common view of the situation in the last third of the century by saying:

When philosophy discovers something wrong with science, sometimes science has to be changed—Russell&#x27;s paradox comes to mind, as does Berkeley&#x27;s attack on the actual infinitesimal—but more often it is philosophy that has to be changed. I do not think that the difficulties that philosophy finds with classical mathematics today are genuine difficulties; and I think that the philosophical interpretations of mathematics that we are being offered on every hand are wrong, and that &quot;philosophical interpretation&quot; is just what mathematics doesn&#x27;t need.
Philosophy of mathematics today proceeds along several different lines of inquiry, by philosophers of mathematics, logicians, and mathematicians, and there are many schools of thought on the subject. The schools are addressed separately in the next section, and their assumptions explained.

==Contemporary schools of thought==
Contemporary schools of thought in the philosophy of mathematics include: artistic, Platonism, mathematicism, logicism, formalism, conventionalism, intuitionism, constructivism, finitism, structuralism, embodied mind theories (Aristotelian realism, psychologism, empiricism), fictionalism, social constructivism, and non-traditional schools.

===Artistic===
The view that claims that mathematics is the aesthetic combination of assumptions, and then also claims that mathematics is an art. A famous mathematician who claims that is the British G. H. Hardy. For Hardy, in his book, &quot;A Mathematician&#x27;s Apology&quot;, the definition of mathematics was more like the aesthetic combination of concepts.

===Platonism===
===Mathematicism===

Max Tegmark&#x27;s mathematical universe hypothesis (or mathematicism) goes further than Platonism in asserting that not only do all mathematical objects exist, but nothing else does. Tegmark&#x27;s sole postulate is: &quot;All structures that exist mathematically also exist physically&quot;. That is, in the sense that &quot;in those [worlds] complex enough to contain self-aware substructures [they] will subjectively perceive themselves as existing in a physically &#x27;real&#x27; world&quot;.

===Logicism===

Logicism is the thesis that mathematics is reducible to logic, and hence nothing but a part of logic. Logicists hold that mathematics can be known &quot;a priori&quot;, but suggest that our knowledge of mathematics is just part of our knowledge of logic in general, and is thus analytic, not requiring any special faculty of mathematical intuition. In this view, logic is the proper foundation of mathematics, and all mathematical statements are necessary logical truths.

Rudolf Carnap (1931) presents the logicist thesis in two parts:
#The &quot;concepts&quot; of mathematics can be derived from logical concepts through explicit definitions.
#The &quot;theorems&quot; of mathematics can be derived from logical axioms through purely logical deduction.

Gottlob Frege was the founder of logicism. In his seminal &quot;Die Grundgesetze der Arithmetik&quot; (&quot;Basic Laws of Arithmetic&quot;) he built up arithmetic from a system of logic with a general principle of comprehension, which he called &quot;Basic Law V&quot; (for concepts &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot;, the extension of &quot;F&quot; equals the extension of &quot;G&quot; if and only if for all objects &quot;a&quot;, &quot;Fa&quot; equals &quot;Ga&quot;), a principle that he took to be acceptable as part of logic.

Frege&#x27;s construction was flawed. Bertrand Russell discovered that Basic Law V is inconsistent (this is Russell&#x27;s paradox). Frege abandoned his logicist program soon after this, but it was continued by Russell and Whitehead. They attributed the paradox to &quot;vicious circularity&quot; and built up what they called ramified type theory to deal with it. In this system, they were eventually able to build up much of modern mathematics but in an altered, and excessively complex form (for example, there were different natural numbers in each type, and there were infinitely many types). They also had to make several compromises in order to develop much of mathematics, such as the &quot;axiom of reducibility&quot;. Even Russell said that this axiom did not really belong to logic.

Modern logicists (like Bob Hale, Crispin Wright, and perhaps others) have returned to a program closer to Frege&#x27;s. They have abandoned Basic Law V in favor of abstraction principles such as Hume&#x27;s principle (the number of objects falling under the concept &quot;F&quot; equals the number of objects falling under the concept &quot;G&quot; if and only if the extension of &quot;F&quot; and the extension of &quot;G&quot; can be put into one-to-one correspondence). Frege required Basic Law V to be able to give an explicit definition of the numbers, but all the properties of numbers can be derived from Hume&#x27;s principle. This would not have been enough for Frege because (to paraphrase him) it does not exclude the possibility that the number 3 is in fact Julius Caesar. In addition, many of the weakened principles that they have had to adopt to replace Basic Law V no longer seem so obviously analytic, and thus purely logical.

===Formalism===

Formalism holds that mathematical statements may be thought of as statements about the consequences of certain string manipulation rules. For example, in the &quot;game&quot; of Euclidean geometry (which is seen as consisting of some strings called &quot;axioms&quot;, and some &quot;rules of inference&quot; to generate new strings from given ones), one can prove that the Pythagorean theorem holds (that is, one can generate the string corresponding to the Pythagorean theorem). According to formalism, mathematical truths are not about numbers and sets and triangles and the like—in fact, they are not &quot;about&quot; anything at all.

Another version of formalism is known as deductivism. In deductivism, the Pythagorean theorem is not an absolute truth, but a relative one, if it follows deductively from the appropriate axioms. The same is held to be true for all other mathematical statements.

Formalism need not mean that mathematics is nothing more than a meaningless symbolic game. It is usually hoped that there exists some interpretation in which the rules of the game hold. (Compare this position to structuralism.) But it does allow the working mathematician to continue in his or her work and leave such problems to the philosopher or scientist. Many formalists would say that in practice, the axiom systems to be studied will be suggested by the demands of science or other areas of mathematics.
A major early proponent of formalism was David Hilbert, whose program was intended to be a complete and consistent axiomatization of all of mathematics. Hilbert aimed to show the consistency of mathematical systems from the assumption that the &quot;finitary arithmetic&quot; (a subsystem of the usual arithmetic of the positive integers, chosen to be philosophically uncontroversial) was consistent. Hilbert&#x27;s goals of creating a system of mathematics that is both complete and consistent were seriously undermined by the second of Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems, which states that sufficiently expressive consistent axiom systems can never prove their own consistency. Since any such axiom system would contain the finitary arithmetic as a subsystem, Gödel&#x27;s theorem implied that it would be impossible to prove the system&#x27;s consistency relative to that (since it would then prove its own consistency, which Gödel had shown was impossible). Thus, in order to show that any axiomatic system of mathematics is in fact consistent, one needs to first assume the consistency of a system of mathematics that is in a sense stronger than the system to be proven consistent.

Hilbert was initially a deductivist, but, as may be clear from above, he considered certain metamathematical methods to yield intrinsically meaningful results and was a realist with respect to the finitary arithmetic. Later, he held the opinion that there was no other meaningful mathematics whatsoever, regardless of interpretation.

Other formalists, such as Rudolf Carnap, Alfred Tarski, and Haskell Curry, considered mathematics to be the investigation of formal axiom systems. Mathematical logicians study formal systems but are just as often realists as they are formalists.

Formalists are relatively tolerant and inviting to new approaches to logic, non-standard number systems, new set theories, etc. The more games we study, the better. However, in all three of these examples, motivation is drawn from existing mathematical or philosophical concerns. The &quot;games&quot; are usually not arbitrary.

The main critique of formalism is that the actual mathematical ideas that occupy mathematicians are far removed from the string manipulation games mentioned above. Formalism is thus silent on the question of which axiom systems ought to be studied, as none is more meaningful than another from a formalistic point of view.

Recently, some formalist mathematicians have proposed that all of our &quot;formal&quot; mathematical knowledge should be systematically encoded in computer-readable formats, so as to facilitate automated proof checking of mathematical proofs and the use of interactive theorem proving in the development of mathematical theories and computer software. Because of their close connection with computer science, this idea is also advocated by mathematical intuitionists and constructivists in the &quot;computability&quot; tradition—.

===Conventionalism===

The French mathematician Henri Poincaré was among the first to articulate a conventionalist view. Poincaré&#x27;s use of non-Euclidean geometries in his work on differential equations convinced him that Euclidean geometry should not be regarded as &quot;a priori&quot; truth. He held that axioms in geometry should be chosen for the results they produce, not for their apparent coherence with human intuitions about the physical world.

===Intuitionism===
In mathematics, intuitionism is a program of methodological reform whose motto is that &quot;there are no non-experienced mathematical truths&quot; (L. E. J. Brouwer). From this springboard, intuitionists seek to reconstruct what they consider to be the corrigible portion of mathematics in accordance with Kantian concepts of being, becoming, intuition, and knowledge. Brouwer, the founder of the movement, held that mathematical objects arise from the &quot;a priori&quot; forms of the volitions that inform the perception of empirical objects.

A major force behind intuitionism was L. E. J. Brouwer, who rejected the usefulness of formalized logic of any sort for mathematics. His student Arend Heyting postulated an intuitionistic logic, different from the classical Aristotelian logic; this logic does not contain the law of the excluded middle and therefore frowns upon proofs by contradiction. The axiom of choice is also rejected in most intuitionistic set theories, though in some versions it is accepted.

In intuitionism, the term &quot;explicit construction&quot; is not cleanly defined, and that has led to criticisms. Attempts have been made to use the concepts of Turing machine or computable function to fill this gap, leading to the claim that only questions regarding the behavior of finite algorithms are meaningful and should be investigated in mathematics. This has led to the study of the computable numbers, first introduced by Alan Turing. Not surprisingly, then, this approach to mathematics is sometimes associated with theoretical computer science.

====Constructivism====

Like intuitionism, constructivism involves the regulative principle that only mathematical entities which can be explicitly constructed in a certain sense should be admitted to mathematical discourse. In this view, mathematics is an exercise of the human intuition, not a game played with meaningless symbols. Instead, it is about entities that we can create directly through mental activity. In addition, some adherents of these schools reject non-constructive proofs, such as using proof by contradiction when showing the existence of an object or when trying to establish the truth of some proposition. Important work was done by Errett Bishop, who managed to prove versions of the most important theorems in real analysis as constructive analysis in his 1967 &quot;Foundations of Constructive Analysis.&quot;

====Finitism====
Finitism is an extreme form of constructivism, according to which a mathematical object does not exist unless it can be constructed from natural numbers in a finite number of steps. In her book &quot;Philosophy of Set Theory&quot;, Mary Tiles characterized those who allow countably infinite objects as classical finitists, and those who deny even countably infinite objects as strict finitists.

The most famous proponent of finitism was Leopold Kronecker, who said:
Ultrafinitism is an even more extreme version of finitism, which rejects not only infinities but finite quantities that cannot feasibly be constructed with available resources. Another variant of finitism is Euclidean arithmetic, a system developed by John Penn Mayberry in his book &quot;The Foundations of Mathematics in the Theory of Sets&quot;. Mayberry&#x27;s system is Aristotelian in general inspiration and, despite his strong rejection of any role for operationalism or feasibility in the foundations of mathematics, comes to somewhat similar conclusions, such as, for instance, that super-exponentiation is not a legitimate finitary function.

===Structuralism===

Structuralism is a position holding that mathematical theories describe structures, and that mathematical objects are exhaustively defined by their &quot;places&quot; in such structures, consequently having no intrinsic properties. For instance, it would maintain that all that needs to be known about the number 1 is that it is the first whole number after 0. Likewise all the other whole numbers are defined by their places in a structure, the number line. Other examples of mathematical objects might include lines and planes in geometry, or elements and operations in abstract algebra.

Structuralism is an epistemologically realistic view in that it holds that mathematical statements have an objective truth value. However, its central claim only relates to what &quot;kind&quot; of entity a mathematical object is, not to what kind of &quot;existence&quot; mathematical objects or structures have (not, in other words, to their ontology). The kind of existence mathematical objects have would clearly be dependent on that of the structures in which they are embedded; different sub-varieties of structuralism make different ontological claims in this regard.

The &quot;ante rem&quot; structuralism (&quot;before the thing&quot;) has a similar ontology to Platonism. Structures are held to have a real but abstract and immaterial existence. As such, it faces the standard epistemological problem of explaining the interaction between such abstract structures and flesh-and-blood mathematicians .

The &quot;in re&quot; structuralism (&quot;in the thing&quot;) is the equivalent of Aristotelian realism. Structures are held to exist inasmuch as some concrete system exemplifies them. This incurs the usual issues that some perfectly legitimate structures might accidentally happen not to exist, and that a finite physical world might not be &quot;big&quot; enough to accommodate some otherwise legitimate structures.

The &quot;post rem&quot; structuralism (&quot;after the thing&quot;) is anti-realist about structures in a way that parallels nominalism. Like nominalism, the &quot;post rem&quot; approach denies the existence of abstract mathematical objects with properties other than their place in a relational structure. According to this view mathematical &quot;systems&quot; exist, and have structural features in common. If something is true of a structure, it will be true of all systems exemplifying the structure. However, it is merely instrumental to talk of structures being &quot;held in common&quot; between systems: they in fact have no independent existence.

===Embodied mind theories===
Embodied mind theories hold that mathematical thought is a natural outgrowth of the human cognitive apparatus which finds itself in our physical universe. For example, the abstract concept of number springs from the experience of counting discrete objects (requiring the human senses such as sight for detecting the objects, touch; and signalling from the brain). It is held that mathematics is not universal and does not exist in any real sense, other than in human brains. Humans construct, but do not discover, mathematics.

The cognitive processes of pattern-finding and distinguishing objects are also subject to neuroscience; if mathematics is considered to be relevant to a natural world (such as from realism or a degree of it, as opposed to pure solipsism).

Its actual relevance to reality, while accepted to be a trustworthy approximation (it is also suggested the evolution of perceptions, the body, and the senses may have been necessary for survival) is not necessarily accurate to a full realism (and is still subject to flaws such as illusion, assumptions (consequently; the foundations and axioms in which mathematics have been formed by humans), generalisations, deception, and hallucinations). As such, this may also raise questions for the modern scientific method for its compatibility with general mathematics; as while relatively reliable, it is still limited by what can be measured by empiricism which may not be as reliable as previously assumed (see also: &#x27;counterintuitive&#x27; concepts in such as quantum nonlocality, and action at a distance).

Another issue is that one numeral system may not necessarily be applicable to problem solving. Subjects such as complex numbers or imaginary numbers require specific changes to more commonly used axioms of mathematics; otherwise they cannot be adequately understood.

Alternatively, computer programmers may use hexadecimal for its &#x27;human-friendly&#x27; representation of binary-coded values, rather than decimal (convenient for counting because humans have ten fingers). The axioms or logical rules behind mathematics also vary through time (such as the adaption and invention of zero).

As perceptions from the human brain are subject to illusions, assumptions, deceptions, (induced) hallucinations, cognitive errors or assumptions in a general context, it can be questioned whether they are accurate or strictly indicative of truth (see also: philosophy of being), and the nature of empiricism itself in relation to the universe and whether it is independent to the senses and the universe.

The human mind has no special claim on reality or approaches to it built out of math. If such constructs as Euler&#x27;s identity are true then they are true as a map of the human mind and cognition.

Embodied mind theorists thus explain the effectiveness of mathematics—mathematics was constructed by the brain in order to be effective in this universe.

The most accessible, famous, and infamous treatment of this perspective is &quot;Where Mathematics Comes From&quot;, by George Lakoff and Rafael E. Núñez. In addition, mathematician Keith Devlin has investigated similar concepts with his book &quot;The Math Instinct&quot;, as has neuroscientist Stanislas Dehaene with his book &quot;The Number Sense&quot;. 

====Aristotelian realism====
Aristotelian realism holds that mathematics studies properties such as symmetry, continuity and order that can be literally realized in the physical world (or in any other world there might be). It contrasts with Platonism in holding that the objects of mathematics, such as numbers, do not exist in an &quot;abstract&quot; world but can be physically realized. For example, the number 4 is realized in the relation between a heap of parrots and the universal &quot;being a parrot&quot; that divides the heap into so many parrots. Aristotelian realism is defended by James Franklin and the Sydney School in the philosophy of mathematics and is close to the view of Penelope Maddy that when an egg carton is opened, a set of three eggs is perceived (that is, a mathematical entity realized in the physical world). A problem for Aristotelian realism is what account to give of higher infinities, which may not be realizable in the physical world.

The Euclidean arithmetic developed by John Penn Mayberry in his book &quot;The Foundations of Mathematics in the Theory of Sets&quot; also falls into the Aristotelian realist tradition. Mayberry, following Euclid, considers numbers to be simply &quot;definite multitudes of units&quot; realized in nature—such as &quot;the members of the London Symphony Orchestra&quot; or &quot;the trees in Birnam wood&quot;. Whether or not there are definite multitudes of units for which Euclid&#x27;s Common Notion 5 (the whole is greater than the part) fails and which would consequently be reckoned as infinite is for Mayberry essentially a question about Nature and does not entail any transcendental suppositions.

====Psychologism====

Psychologism in the philosophy of mathematics is the position that mathematical concepts and/or truths are grounded in, derived from or explained by psychological facts (or laws).

John Stuart Mill seems to have been an advocate of a type of logical psychologism, as were many 19th-century German logicians such as Sigwart and Erdmann as well as a number of psychologists, past and present: for example, Gustave Le Bon. Psychologism was famously criticized by Frege in his &quot;The Foundations of Arithmetic&quot;, and many of his works and essays, including his review of Husserl&#x27;s &quot;Philosophy of Arithmetic&quot;. Edmund Husserl, in the first volume of his &quot;Logical Investigations&quot;, called &quot;The Prolegomena of Pure Logic&quot;, criticized psychologism thoroughly and sought to distance himself from it. The &quot;Prolegomena&quot; is considered a more concise, fair, and thorough refutation of psychologism than the criticisms made by Frege, and also it is considered today by many as being a memorable refutation for its decisive blow to psychologism. Psychologism was also criticized by Charles Sanders Peirce and Maurice Merleau-Ponty.

====Empiricism====

Mathematical empiricism is a form of realism that denies that mathematics can be known &quot;a priori&quot; at all. It says that we discover mathematical facts by empirical research, just like facts in any of the other sciences. It is not one of the classical three positions advocated in the early 20th century, but primarily arose in the middle of the century. However, an important early proponent of a view like this was John Stuart Mill. Mill&#x27;s view was widely criticized, because, according to critics, such as A.J. Ayer, it makes statements like come out as uncertain, contingent truths, which we can only learn by observing instances of two pairs coming together and forming a quartet.

Karl Popper was another philosopher to point out empirical aspects of mathematics, observing that &quot;most mathematical theories are, like those of physics and biology, hypothetico-deductive: pure mathematics therefore turns out to be much closer to the natural sciences whose hypotheses are conjectures, than it seemed even recently.&quot; Popper also noted he would &quot;admit a system as empirical or scientific only if it is capable of being tested by experience.&quot;

Contemporary mathematical empiricism, formulated by W. V. O. Quine and Hilary Putnam, is primarily supported by the indispensability argument: mathematics is indispensable to all empirical sciences, and if we want to believe in the reality of the phenomena described by the sciences, we ought also believe in the reality of those entities required for this description. That is, since physics needs to talk about electrons to say why light bulbs behave as they do, then electrons must exist. Since physics needs to talk about numbers in offering any of its explanations, then numbers must exist. In keeping with Quine and Putnam&#x27;s overall philosophies, this is a naturalistic argument. It argues for the existence of mathematical entities as the best explanation for experience, thus stripping mathematics of being distinct from the other sciences.

Putnam strongly rejected the term &quot;Platonist&quot; as implying an over-specific ontology that was not necessary to mathematical practice in any real sense. He advocated a form of &quot;pure realism&quot; that rejected mystical notions of truth and accepted much quasi-empiricism in mathematics. This grew from the increasingly popular assertion in the late 20th century that no one foundation of mathematics could be ever proven to exist. It is also sometimes called &quot;postmodernism in mathematics&quot; although that term is considered overloaded by some and insulting by others. Quasi-empiricism argues that in doing their research, mathematicians test hypotheses as well as prove theorems. A mathematical argument can transmit falsity from the conclusion to the premises just as well as it can transmit truth from the premises to the conclusion. Putnam has argued that any theory of mathematical realism would include quasi-empirical methods. He proposed that an alien species doing mathematics might well rely on quasi-empirical methods primarily, being willing often to forgo rigorous and axiomatic proofs, and still be doing mathematics—at perhaps a somewhat greater risk of failure of their calculations. He gave a detailed argument for this in &quot;New Directions&quot;. Quasi-empiricism was also developed by Imre Lakatos.

The most important criticism of empirical views of mathematics is approximately the same as that raised against Mill. If mathematics is just as empirical as the other sciences, then this suggests that its results are just as fallible as theirs, and just as contingent. In Mill&#x27;s case the empirical justification comes directly, while in Quine&#x27;s case it comes indirectly, through the coherence of our scientific theory as a whole, i.e. consilience after E.O. Wilson. Quine suggests that mathematics seems completely certain because the role it plays in our web of belief is extraordinarily central, and that it would be extremely difficult for us to revise it, though not impossible.

For a philosophy of mathematics that attempts to overcome some of the shortcomings of Quine and Gödel&#x27;s approaches by taking aspects of each see Penelope Maddy&#x27;s &quot;Realism in Mathematics&quot;. Another example of a realist theory is the embodied mind theory.

===Fictionalism===

Mathematical fictionalism was brought to fame in 1980 when Hartry Field published &quot;Science Without Numbers&quot;, which rejected and in fact reversed Quine&#x27;s indispensability argument. Where Quine suggested that mathematics was indispensable for our best scientific theories, and therefore should be accepted as a body of truths talking about independently existing entities, Field suggested that mathematics was dispensable, and therefore should be considered as a body of falsehoods not talking about anything real. He did this by giving a complete axiomatization of Newtonian mechanics with no reference to numbers or functions at all. He started with the &quot;betweenness&quot; of Hilbert&#x27;s axioms to characterize space without coordinatizing it, and then added extra relations between points to do the work formerly done by vector fields. Hilbert&#x27;s geometry is mathematical, because it talks about abstract points, but in Field&#x27;s theory, these points are the concrete points of physical space, so no special mathematical objects at all are needed.

Having shown how to do science without using numbers, Field proceeded to rehabilitate mathematics as a kind of useful fiction. He showed that mathematical physics is a conservative extension of his non-mathematical physics (that is, every physical fact provable in mathematical physics is already provable from Field&#x27;s system), so that mathematics is a reliable process whose physical applications are all true, even though its own statements are false. Thus, when doing mathematics, we can see ourselves as telling a sort of story, talking as if numbers existed. For Field, a statement like is just as fictitious as &quot;Sherlock Holmes lived at 221B Baker Street&quot;—but both are true according to the relevant fictions.

Another fictionalist, Mary Leng, expresses the perspective succinctly by dismissing any seeming connection between mathematics and the physical world as &quot;a happy coincidence&quot;. This rejection separates fictionalism from other forms of anti-realism, which see mathematics itself as artificial but still bounded or fitted to reality in some way.

By this account, there are no metaphysical or epistemological problems special to mathematics. The only worries left are the general worries about non-mathematical physics, and about fiction in general. Field&#x27;s approach has been very influential, but is widely rejected. This is in part because of the requirement of strong fragments of second-order logic to carry out his reduction, and because the statement of conservativity seems to require quantification over abstract models or deductions.

===Social constructivism===

Social constructivism sees mathematics primarily as a social construct, as a product of culture, subject to correction and change. Like the other sciences, mathematics is viewed as an empirical endeavor whose results are constantly evaluated and may be discarded. However, while on an empiricist view the evaluation is some sort of comparison with &quot;reality&quot;, social constructivists emphasize that the direction of mathematical research is dictated by the fashions of the social group performing it or by the needs of the society financing it. However, although such external forces may change the direction of some mathematical research, there are strong internal constraints—the mathematical traditions, methods, problems, meanings and values into which mathematicians are enculturated—that work to conserve the historically defined discipline.

This runs counter to the traditional beliefs of working mathematicians, that mathematics is somehow pure or objective. But social constructivists argue that mathematics is in fact grounded by much uncertainty: as mathematical practice evolves, the status of previous mathematics is cast into doubt, and is corrected to the degree it is required or desired by the current mathematical community. This can be seen in the development of analysis from reexamination of the calculus of Leibniz and Newton. They argue further that finished mathematics is often accorded too much status, and folk mathematics not enough, due to an overemphasis on axiomatic proof and peer review as practices.

The social nature of mathematics is highlighted in its subcultures. Major discoveries can be made in one branch of mathematics and be relevant to another, yet the relationship goes undiscovered for lack of social contact between mathematicians. Social constructivists argue each speciality forms its own epistemic community and often has great difficulty communicating, or motivating the investigation of unifying conjectures that might relate different areas of mathematics. Social constructivists see the process of &quot;doing mathematics&quot; as actually creating the meaning, while social realists see a deficiency either of human capacity to abstractify, or of human&#x27;s cognitive bias, or of mathematicians&#x27; collective intelligence as preventing the comprehension of a real universe of mathematical objects. Social constructivists sometimes reject the search for foundations of mathematics as bound to fail, as pointless or even meaningless.

Contributions to this school have been made by Imre Lakatos and Thomas Tymoczko, although it is not clear that either would endorse the title. More recently Paul Ernest has explicitly formulated a social constructivist philosophy of mathematics. Some consider the work of Paul Erdős as a whole to have advanced this view (although he personally rejected it) because of his uniquely broad collaborations, which prompted others to see and study &quot;mathematics as a social activity&quot;, e.g., via the Erdős number. Reuben Hersh has also promoted the social view of mathematics, calling it a &quot;humanistic&quot; approach, similar to but not quite the same as that associated with Alvin White; one of Hersh&#x27;s co-authors, Philip J. Davis, has expressed sympathy for the social view as well.

===Beyond the traditional schools===
====Unreasonable effectiveness====
Rather than focus on narrow debates about the true nature of mathematical truth, or even on practices unique to mathematicians such as the proof, a growing movement from the 1960s to the 1990s began to question the idea of seeking foundations or finding any one right answer to why mathematics works. The starting point for this was Eugene Wigner&#x27;s famous 1960 paper &quot;The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences&quot;, in which he argued that the happy coincidence of mathematics and physics being so well matched seemed to be unreasonable and hard to explain.

====Popper&#x27;s two senses of number statements====
Realist and constructivist theories are normally taken to be contraries. However, Karl Popper argued that a number statement such as can be taken in two senses. In one sense it is irrefutable and logically true. In the second sense it is factually true and falsifiable. Another way of putting this is to say that a single number statement can express two propositions: one of which can be explained on constructivist lines; the other on realist lines.

====Philosophy of language====

Innovations in the philosophy of language during the 20th century renewed interest in whether mathematics is, as is often said, the &quot;language&quot; of science. Although some mathematicians and philosophers would accept the statement &quot;mathematics is a language&quot; (most consider that the language of mathematics is a part of mathematics to which mathematics cannot be reduced), linguists believe that the implications of such a statement must be considered. For example, the tools of linguistics are not generally applied to the symbol systems of mathematics, that is, mathematics is studied in a markedly different way from other languages. If mathematics is a language, it is a different type of language from natural languages. Indeed, because of the need for clarity and specificity, the language of mathematics is far more constrained than natural languages studied by linguists. However, the methods developed by Frege and Tarski for the study of mathematical language have been extended greatly by Tarski&#x27;s student Richard Montague and other linguists working in formal semantics to show that the distinction between mathematical language and natural language may not be as great as it seems.

Mohan Ganesalingam has analysed mathematical language using tools from formal linguistics. Ganesalingam notes that some features of natural language are not necessary when analysing mathematical language (such as tense), but many of the same analytical tools can be used (such as context-free grammars). One important difference is that mathematical objects have clearly defined types, which can be explicitly defined in a text: &quot;Effectively, we are allowed to introduce a word in one part of a sentence, and declare its part of speech in another; and this operation has no analogue in natural language.&quot;

==Arguments==
===Indispensability argument for realism===

This argument, associated with Willard Quine and Hilary Putnam, is considered by Stephen Yablo to be one of the most challenging arguments in favor of the acceptance of the existence of abstract mathematical entities, such as numbers and sets. The form of the argument is as follows.
#One must have ontological commitments to &quot;all&quot; entities that are indispensable to the best scientific theories, and to those entities &quot;only&quot; (commonly referred to as &quot;all and only&quot;).
#Mathematical entities are indispensable to the best scientific theories. Therefore,
#One must have ontological commitments to mathematical entities.

The justification for the first premise is the most controversial. Both Putnam and Quine invoke naturalism to justify the exclusion of all non-scientific entities, and hence to defend the &quot;only&quot; part of &quot;all and only&quot;. The assertion that &quot;all&quot; entities postulated in scientific theories, including numbers, should be accepted as real is justified by confirmation holism. Since theories are not confirmed in a piecemeal fashion, but as a whole, there is no justification for excluding any of the entities referred to in well-confirmed theories. This puts the nominalist who wishes to exclude the existence of sets and non-Euclidean geometry, but to include the existence of quarks and other undetectable entities of physics, for example, in a difficult position.

===Epistemic argument against realism===
The anti-realist &quot;epistemic argument&quot; against Platonism has been made by Paul Benacerraf and Hartry Field. Platonism posits that mathematical objects are &quot;abstract&quot; entities. By general agreement, abstract entities cannot interact causally with concrete, physical entities (&quot;the truth-values of our mathematical assertions depend on facts involving Platonic entities that reside in a realm outside of space-time&quot;). Whilst our knowledge of concrete, physical objects is based on our ability to perceive them, and therefore to causally interact with them, there is no parallel account of how mathematicians come to have knowledge of abstract objects. Another way of making the point is that if the Platonic world were to disappear, it would make no difference to the ability of mathematicians to generate proofs, etc., which is already fully accountable in terms of physical processes in their brains.

Field developed his views into fictionalism. Benacerraf also developed the philosophy of mathematical structuralism, according to which there are no mathematical objects. Nonetheless, some versions of structuralism are compatible with some versions of realism.

The argument hinges on the idea that a satisfactory naturalistic account of thought processes in terms of brain processes can be given for mathematical reasoning along with everything else. One line of defense is to maintain that this is false, so that mathematical reasoning uses some special intuition that involves contact with the Platonic realm. A modern form of this argument is given by Sir Roger Penrose.

Another line of defense is to maintain that abstract objects are relevant to mathematical reasoning in a way that is non-causal, and not analogous to perception. This argument is developed by Jerrold Katz in his 2000 book &quot;Realistic Rationalism&quot;.

A more radical defense is denial of physical reality, i.e. the mathematical universe hypothesis. In that case, a mathematician&#x27;s knowledge of mathematics is one mathematical object making contact with another.

==Aesthetics==

Many practicing mathematicians have been drawn to their subject because of a sense of beauty they perceive in it. One sometimes hears the sentiment that mathematicians would like to leave philosophy to the philosophers and get back to mathematics—where, presumably, the beauty lies.

In his work on the divine proportion, H.E. Huntley relates the feeling of reading and understanding someone else&#x27;s proof of a theorem of mathematics to that of a viewer of a masterpiece of art—the reader of a proof has a similar sense of exhilaration at understanding as the original author of the proof, much as, he argues, the viewer of a masterpiece has a sense of exhilaration similar to the original painter or sculptor. Indeed, one can study mathematical and scientific writings as literature.

Philip J. Davis and Reuben Hersh have commented that the sense of mathematical beauty is universal amongst practicing mathematicians. By way of example, they provide two proofs of the irrationality of . The first is the traditional proof by contradiction, ascribed to Euclid; the second is a more direct proof involving the fundamental theorem of arithmetic that, they argue, gets to the heart of the issue. Davis and Hersh argue that mathematicians find the second proof more aesthetically appealing because it gets closer to the nature of the problem.

Paul Erdős was well known for his notion of a hypothetical &quot;Book&quot; containing the most elegant or beautiful mathematical proofs. There is not universal agreement that a result has one &quot;most elegant&quot; proof; Gregory Chaitin has argued against this idea.

Philosophers have sometimes criticized mathematicians&#x27; sense of beauty or elegance as being, at best, vaguely stated. By the same token, however, philosophers of mathematics have sought to characterize what makes one proof more desirable than another when both are logically sound.

Another aspect of aesthetics concerning mathematics is mathematicians&#x27; views towards the possible uses of mathematics for purposes deemed unethical or inappropriate. The best-known exposition of this view occurs in G. H. Hardy&#x27;s book &quot;A Mathematician&#x27;s Apology&quot;, in which Hardy argues that pure mathematics is superior in beauty to applied mathematics precisely because it cannot be used for war and similar ends.

<text>Assassins is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and a book by John Weidman, based on an original concept by Charles Gilbert Jr.

Using the framing device of an all-American, yet sinister, carnival game, the semi-revue portrays a group of historical figures who attempted (successfully or not) to assassinate Presidents of the United States, and explores what their presence in American history says about the ideals of their country. The score is written to reflect both popular music of the various depicted eras and a broader tradition of &quot;patriotic&quot; American music.

The musical opened Off-Broadway in 1990 to many mixed and negative reviews, and ran for 73 performances; in 2004, the show was produced on Broadway to highly favorable notices and won five Tony Awards, including Best Revival of a Musical.

==Background and productions==
===Background===
In 1979, as a panelist at producer Stuart Ostrow&#x27;s Musical Theater Lab, Sondheim read a script by playwright Charles Gilbert Jr. entitled &quot;Assassins&quot;. Inspired by its title and use of quotations from various historical figures who had attempted to assassinate American Presidents, Sondheim asked Gilbert for permission to use his idea. Gilbert consented and offered to write the book, but Sondheim declined, having already had collaborator John Weidman in mind. Weidman had written the book for &quot;Pacific Overtures&quot; and would work with Sondheim again on &quot;Road Show&quot;.

Gilbert&#x27;s original concept involved a fictional Vietnam War veteran who becomes an assassin and around this central narrative he had woven diary entries, poems, and newspaper reports of historical assassins. Sondheim and Weidman, having no interest in the fictional element, focused the musical solely on the historical figures. Five assassins appear in both versions: John Wilkes Booth, Charles J. Guiteau, Leon Czolgosz, Giuseppe Zangara, and Squeaky Fromme. The model for Gilbert&#x27;s protagonist, Lee Harvey Oswald, also appears in the musical as himself. The musical omits three assassins included in Gilbert’s script—Arthur Bremer (cut in rehearsals), Sirhan Sirhan (mentioned by name only), and John Schrank—and instead features Samuel Byck, Sara Jane Moore, and John Hinckley Jr., the last of whom had not yet attempted an assassination when Gilbert&#x27;s version was written.

Aside from the title, Sondheim and Weidman also retained Gilbert&#x27;s distinctive conceptual metaphor of the shooting gallery, presided over by a character called Fat Man (somewhat analogous to Weidman’s Proprietor) who is encouraging would-be assassins to &quot;shoot the Prez and win a prize.&quot;

The first staged reading of the musical, at Playwrights Horizons on December 18, 1989, was directed by Jerry Zaks and featured Anthony Heald (Czolgosz), Paul McCrane (Hinckley), Michael Jeter (Zangara), Jonathan Hadary (Guiteau), Swoosie Kurtz (Fromme), Christine Baranski (Moore), Victor Garber (Booth), Kevin Anderson (Balladeer/Oswald) and Nathan Lane (Byck).

According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The show has been sold out since previews began, reflecting the strong appeal of Sondheim&#x27;s work among the theater crowd.&quot; Frank Rich in his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Assassins&quot; will have to fire with sharper aim and fewer blanks if it is to shoot to kill.&quot;

== Synopsis ==
This synopsis reflects the current licensed version of the show. The published script of the 1992 Off-Broadway production is slightly different.

The show opens in a fairground shooting gallery where, amid flashing lights, human figures trundle past on a conveyor belt. One by one, a collection of misfits enters the stage, where the Proprietor of the game entices them to play, promising that their problems will be solved by killing a President (&quot;Everybody’s Got the Right&quot;). Leon Czolgosz, John Hinckley, Charles Guiteau, Giuseppe Zangara, Samuel Byck, Lynette &quot;Squeaky&quot; Fromme, and Sara Jane Moore are given their guns one by one. John Wilkes Booth enters last and the Proprietor introduces him to the others as their pioneer before he begins distributing ammunition. The assassins take aim as &quot;Hail to the Chief&quot; heralds Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s offstage arrival. Booth excuses himself, a shot rings out and Booth shouts, &quot;Sic semper tyrannis!&quot;

The Balladeer, a personification of the American Dream, appears and begins to tell John Wilkes Booth&#x27;s story (&quot;The Ballad of Booth&quot;) as the scene changes to Richard H. Garrett&#x27;s barn in 1865. Booth, mudstained and with a broken leg, is attempting to write his reasons for killing Lincoln in his diary but cannot hold the pen. He forces his associate David Herold to write for him at gunpoint. As Booth dictates, blaming Lincoln for the Civil War and for destroying the South, the Balladeer interjects that Booth&#x27;s motives really had more to do with his personal problems, much to Booth&#x27;s annoyance. When a Union soldier calls for Booth&#x27;s surrender, Herold abandons him and surrenders. In desperation, Booth throws the Balladeer his diary so that he can tell his story to the world. The Balladeer reads out Booth&#x27;s justifications, and Booth laments that the act for which he has given up his life will not be enough to heal the country. As the Union soldiers set fire to the barn, Booth commits suicide, and the Balladeer concludes that Booth was a madman whose treacherous legacy only served as inspiration for other madmen like him to damage the country. The Balladeer rips Booth&#x27;s rationale from his diary and burns the pages.

The Assassins gather in a bar. Guiteau toasts to the Presidency of the United States, speaking of his ambition to become Ambassador to France. Hinckley accidentally breaks a bottle, and Czolgosz flies into a rage, describing the horrors he sees in the bottle factory he works in and how many men die or are injured just to make a bottle like the one Hinckley has just broken. Guiteau jokingly tells Czolgosz to find another job, and the two begin to argue about the American Dream, with Guiteau defending America and Czolgosz dismissing the &quot;land of opportunity&quot; as a lie. Czolgosz becomes enraged and grabs a bottle, barely stopping himself from throwing it across the room. Booth urges Czolgosz to take control of his fate by breaking a bottle himself, but Czolgosz cannot. Zangara complains about his stomach pains, and Booth suggests fixing them by shooting Franklin D. Roosevelt.

A radio broadcast, narrated by the Proprietor, describes Zangara&#x27;s failed attempt to assassinate Roosevelt. He misses Roosevelt and accidentally kills Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak instead. Five Bystanders are interviewed in turn, telling the audience their personal versions of the event; each is convinced that he or she personally saved the President (&quot;How I Saved Roosevelt&quot;). From an electric chair, Zangara sings his refusal to be afraid and that he hadn&#x27;t cared whom he killed as long as it was one of the men who control the money. Peeved that as an &quot;American Nothing&quot; he has no photographers at his execution, Zangara is electrocuted as the Bystanders preen for the cameras.

American anarchist leader Emma Goldman gives a lecture from offstage as Leon Czolgosz listens, enraptured. He introduces himself to her and declares his love, but she tells him to redirect his passion to the fight for social justice. She gives him a leaflet that she tells him contains an idea that is &quot;not mine alone, but mine&quot;. As she prepares to leave, Czolgosz offers to carry her bag, to which Goldman protests by saying, &quot;They make us servants, Leon. We do not make servants of each other.&quot; Czolgosz, in his first display of assertiveness, still insists.

Fromme and Moore meet on a park bench and share a joint. Fromme speaks of the apocalyptic preachings of mass murderer Charles Manson, remembering how they met and declaring herself his lover and slave. Juggling her purse, a can of Tab and a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken, Moore claims she is an informant for the FBI (or used to be), has been a CPA and had five husbands and three children. They connect over their shared hatred of their fathers, and using Colonel Sanders as a graven image, they give the bucket of chicken the evil eye and then shoot it to pieces while laughing hysterically. Moore realizes that she had known Manson in high school, and the scene ends as the women scream in delight over their memories of the charismatic killer.

Czolgosz reflects on how many men die in the mines, the steel mills and the factories just to make a gun. Booth, Guiteau and Moore enter one by one and join him in a barbershop quartet in which they honor a single gun&#x27;s power to change the world (&quot;The Gun Song&quot;). Czolgosz decides his gun will claim one more victim: the President.

Czolgosz arrives at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition and sees that William McKinley is shaking visitors&#x27; hands in the Temple of Music Pavilion. The Balladeer sings (&quot;The Ballad of Czolgosz&quot;) as Czolgosz joins the receiving line, and upon reaching McKinley, he shoots him.

Samuel Byck sits on a park bench in a dirty Santa suit with a picket sign and a shopping bag. He talks into a tape recorder, preparing a message to Leonard Bernstein telling Bernstein he can save the world by writing more love songs, and explaining that he is going to change things by crashing a 747 into the White House and killing Richard Nixon. Then he accuses Bernstein of ignoring him, just like the other celebrities he has recorded tapes for, such as Hank Aaron and Jonas Salk. After flying into an expletive-laden rage, Byck stands up on the bench and angrily sings the chorus to &quot;West Side Story&quot;″s song &quot;America&quot; before storming offstage.

John Hinckley sits in his rumpus room, aimlessly playing a guitar. Lynette Fromme enters and tries to convince him to play her a song (asking for &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; or &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;), but he refuses. Fromme notices a picture of Jodie Foster, who Hinckley claims is his girlfriend. When Fromme realizes the picture is a publicity photo from a film, she pulls out a picture of Charles Manson and mocks Hinckley for being in love with a woman he&#x27;s never met, which makes him throw her out in a fit of rage. Alone, he swears that he will win Foster&#x27;s love &quot;with one brave, historic act&quot; and sings a love song to her while Fromme individually does the same to Manson (&quot;Unworthy of Your Love&quot;). An image of Ronald Reagan appears on a wall in the back of the stage, and an enraged Hinckley shoots it over and over again, but the picture keeps reappearing. The Proprietor mocks Hinckley by quoting Reagan&#x27;s famous quips about the assassination and his There you go again speech as Hinckley fires and fires, missing each time.

Back at the Proprietor&#x27;s shooting range, Charles Guiteau flirts with Sara Jane Moore while giving her marksmanship tips before trying to kiss her. When she rebuffs him, he becomes suddenly enraged and attempts to attack her. Her gun goes off in his ear, and he backs off, angrily proclaiming that he is extraordinary and will be the next Ambassador to France. The scene changes to a train station, where Guiteau goes to meet James A. Garfield and James G. Blaine. He asks to be made Ambassador to France, but Garfield mockingly refuses, prompting Guiteau to shoot him.

Guiteau is arrested and sent to the gallows, where he recites a poem he wrote that morning titled &quot;I Am Going to the Lordy&quot;. When Guiteau finishes, the Balladeer enters and sings about Guiteau&#x27;s trial and sentencing while Guiteau merrily cakewalks up to the noose, getting more and more desperately optimistic with each verse. Guiteau sings along with the Balladeer about Guiteau&#x27;s optimism before he is finally hanged (&quot;The Ballad of Guiteau&quot;).

Squeaky Fromme and Sara Jane Moore prepare to assassinate Gerald Ford. Moore has brought along her nine-year-old son and her dog (which she accidentally shoots), which causes an argument between the two women, who briefly turn on each other. Moore accidentally spills her gun&#x27;s bullets just as President Ford enters the stage. Not recognizing him at first, the two women allow him to help them, but upon discovering who he is, Fromme tries to shoot him, but her gun jams. Having no other resource left, Moore tries to throw her bullets at Ford, shouting &quot;bang&quot; as she does so.

Samuel Byck is driving to the airport to hijack a plane, which he plans to crash into the White House. Growing completely unhinged, he records a message addressed to Richard Nixon, complaining about contemporary American life, how the American public is constantly lied to, and announces that killing him is the only solution.

The assassins congregate in the Proprietor&#x27;s shooting range once again and enumerate their reasons for taking action. Led by Byck, they lament that they haven&#x27;t gotten the rewards they were &quot;promised&quot;. The Balladeer tells them that their actions didn&#x27;t solve their problems or the country&#x27;s and that if they want their prizes they must follow the American Dream. The assassins realize that they will never get their prizes, that no one will ever care if they live or die, and briefly sink into absolute desperation until Byck and the Proprietor lead them in (&quot;Another National Anthem&quot;), a song for all Americans dispossessed by the dream. The Balladeer attempts to convince them to be optimistic and seek other ways to be happy, but the Anthem grows louder and louder until the assassins force the Balladeer offstage (in the 2004 revival and many productions that followed, the Assassins all surround the Balladeer, transforming him into Lee Harvey Oswald).

The scene changes to the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. The ghosts of John Wilkes Booth, Leon Czolgosz, Charles Guiteau, and the other &quot;would be&quot; assassins including John Hinckley, Giuseppe Zangara, Samuel Byck, Lynette &quot;Squeaky&quot; Fromme, and Sara Jane Moore, appear before a suicidally depressed and aggressive Lee Harvey Oswald, and convince him that the only way for him to truly connect with his country is to share his pain and disillusionment with it. They slowly and carefully attempt to convince him not to become his own victim and to instead assassinate John F. Kennedy. Booth tells Oswald that by joining them he will finally make a difference, but Oswald refuses. Booth tells him that in the future, when Hinckley&#x27;s room is searched, Oswald&#x27;s biographies will be found. Booth tells Oswald that the key to the future is in his hands. Oswald tries to leave, but Zangara addresses him passionately in Italian, his words translated by the other assassins, imploring him to act so their own acts can come alive again. They tell him that he has the power to cause worldwide grief and inspire global passion about himself, a man the world has never cared or heard about. Calling themselves his family, the assassins sing, imploring Oswald to act. He crouches at the window and shoots (&quot;November 22, 1963&quot;).

After the assassinations, a group of citizens from different time periods recount what they were doing when they heard that the President had been killed and lament that even though only a single man died, the nation has changed forever (&quot;Something Just Broke&quot;).

The assassins regroup once more at the shooting range, now with Oswald among their ranks, and they proudly restate their motto, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s got the right to be happy,&quot; before loading their guns and opening fire on the audience (&quot;Everybody&#x27;s Got the Right (Reprise)&quot;).

== Themes ==

=== Sacrificing for the greater good / fighting against political injustice ===
According to Valerie Lynn Schrader, out of the nine assassins in the musical, six of them (John Wilkes Booth, Giuseppe Zangara, Leon Czolgosz, Charles Guiteau, Lynette &quot;Squeaky&quot; Fromme, and Samuel Byck) are motivated to assassinate their targets due to &quot;political injustice and sacrifice for the greater good,&quot; and among the six assassins, Booth and Czolgosz have been portrayed to have such motives as their primary reason for their assassination.

In the musical, John Wilkes Booth believes that his assassination on President Abraham Lincoln is for the greater good (and is an act of patriotism), which is &quot;supported historically: the Ford’s Theatre Museum notes that Booth was part of a conspiracy to assassinate President Lincoln, Vice President Andrew Johnson, and Secretary of State William H. Seward in order to put the Union in a state of disarray and anarchy.&quot; Raymond Knapp states that Booth&#x27;s motivation is &quot;conveyed musically, self-servingly by his own singing in a quasi-hymnic, sometimes inspirational style,&quot; based on the 1991 original Off-Broadway Version.

In the scene before &quot;The Gun Song&quot;, the anarchist Emma Goldman inspires Leon Czolgosz to take action in light of his anarchist beliefs and the &quot;societal injustice&quot; that he has noticed. In &quot;The Gun Song&quot;, Czolgosz has a &quot;moody contemplation of how one gun connects backward to the many lifes it consumes in its manufacture,&quot; and later he claims that &quot;[a] gun claims many men before it&#x27;s done. Just one more,&quot; referring to his assassination target, President William McKinley. The political injustice in Czolgosz&#x27;s timeline would be the &quot;class inequalities in America.&quot;

=== Desiring attention ===
Many assassins in the musical have lines reflecting their need for attention, and according to Wang, &quot;what unites each of the assassins is the desire for attention.&quot; In &quot;How I Saved Roosevelt,&quot; Giuseppe Zangara is extremely angry about not having a photographer even at his execution: &quot;and why there no photographers? For Zangara no photographers! Only capitalists get photographers!&quot; Another assassin, Sara Jane Moore, &quot;proclaims that one of her motives was &#x27;so that her friends would know where [she] was coming from.&#x27;&quot;

Lynette &quot;Squeaky&quot; Fromme and John Hinckley Jr. are described as a &quot;loving couple&quot; in the musical, but the love that they show is in order to try to draw attention from two different persons. Unlike some assassins such as Zangara whose goals might reflect many of the themes of the musical, these two assassins have only one motive - to get attention from the person they love (for Fromme, it is Charles Manson; for Hinckley, it is Jodie Foster). In the short monologue before the song &quot;Unworthy of Your Love&quot;, Hinckley states that &quot;[he] will win [Foster&#x27;s] love, now and for all eternity.&quot;

=== Idealism and optimism ===
This theme is mainly represented by Charles Guiteau. His idealism and optimism might make audience members &quot;feel more sympathy for Guiteau than for some of the other assassins.&quot; Throughout the musical, Guiteau has lines and lyrics which show his idealism and optimism towards his life and the world. The quartet &quot;The Gun Song&quot;, which Guiteau participates in, and the song &quot;The Ballad of Guiteau&quot; both portray him as an optimist while others are depicted as dark and not so optimistic. For example, in &quot;The Gun Song&quot;, Guiteau &quot;waltzes in cheerfully, holding a gun up admiringly, and declares: &#x27;What a wonder is a gun! What a versatile invention,&#x27;&quot; while Czolgosz just states that &quot;[he hates] this gun.&quot; Guiteau&#x27;s idealism is delusional, an exuberant but transparently flimsy cover for decidedly more earthly and self-interested ambition, and when his desires are thwarted, he gets angry. For example, he angrily shouts to Moore that &quot;[he wants a kiss]&quot; after Moore has already turned him down, and he assassinates President Garfield when denied the ambassadorship to France. His idealism and optimism are shown even in his execution scene (in &quot;The Ballad of Guiteau&quot;): he believes that &quot;[he] shall be remembered&quot; for assassinating President Garfield.

=== Pain, desperation, and disillusionment ===
Pain and desperation are central to Zangara&#x27;s character: he is portrayed as a poor immigrant who suffers a very strong stomachache. In &quot;How I Saved Roosevelt&quot;, Zangara&#x27;s stomach pain and his desperation about not being able to cure his stomachache turn into his anger and hatred towards the upper class. According to Schrader, the real-life Moore attempted her assassination due to political reasons, yet in the musical, she does so due to an entirely different one: she is so frustrated and desperate about &quot;how to understand and express herself&quot; that she takes &quot;drastic action.&quot; On the other hand, Byck&#x27;s assassination attempt on President Richard Nixon is also to &quot;satisfy his personal frustrations.&quot; His solo scene, titled &quot;Have It Your Way&quot; in the 2004 Broadway cast recording, presents his pain and disillusionment through his words and emotional expressions.

Unlike all the other assassins in the musical, &quot;[Lee Harvey Oswald] is portrayed as a desperate man attempting to commit suicide and as the only assassin who had no intention of killing a President.&quot; In the scene corresponding to this (the original 1991 Off-Broadway version is called &quot;November 22, 1963&quot;), Booth, as the leader of all assassins, tries to convince Oswald to assassinate President John F. Kennedy instead of committing suicide using countless tactics, yet he has to rely on other assassins to ultimately convince Oswald to do so. Schrader argues that &quot;audience members who have encountered depression may find a level of consubstantiality with [him], at least until he is convinced to commit murder.&quot;

=== Community ===
As Schrader states, &quot;Mark Fulk and Angela Howard suggest that &#x27;family&#x27; is &quot;Assassins&quot;&#x27; central metaphor, particularly noting that family is &#x27;the central concept that binds the group of American assassins and would-be assassins.&#x27;&quot;

In the scene &quot;November 22, 1963&quot;, the assassins join together in order to persuade Oswald to assassinate President John F. Kennedy while assuring him that he can &quot;connect&quot; to the other assassins. In addition, the assassins interact with each other despite coming from different time periods, in the scene &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen a Toast&quot;, the scene &quot;I Am a Terrifying and Imposing Figure&quot;, and the songs &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Got the Right&quot;, &quot;Another National Anthem&quot;, and &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Got the Right (Reprise)&quot;.

Comparing the 1991 original production with other later versions, there is one song later added the musical, &quot;Something Just Broke&quot;. This song is an assassin-free one, where five bystanders mourn the assassinated Presidents. These bystanders have different occupations and are in different timelines, yet are brought together by the assassination tragedies, indicating a sense of community among them.

== Versions ==
The three versions of &quot;Assassins&quot; (original, London, and Broadway) are not identical, as some roles were combined, and the song &quot;Something Just Broke&quot; was new to the London production. In 1991, Theatre Communications Group published the libretto, which did not feature &quot;Something Just Broke&quot;.

The current licensed version of the musical reflects the 2004 Broadway revival. Although the script does not combine The Balladeer and Oswald into a single role, many productions have followed the revival in doing so.

== Musical numbers ==

&quot;Notes:&quot;

++Added for the 1992 London production

== Cultural impact ==
Sondheim said that he expected backlash from the public due to the content. &quot;There are always people who think that certain subjects are not right for musicals...[w]e&#x27;re not going to apologize for dealing with such a volatile subject. Nowadays, virtually everything goes,&quot; he told &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

Historian, commentator, and actress Sarah Vowell introduced her 2005 analysis of the Lincoln, McKinley, and Garfield murders, &quot;Assassination Vacation&quot;, with a journey from New York City into New England to attend a performance of &quot;Assassins&quot;.

&quot;Assassins&quot; was featured in episode 6 of Netflix&#x27;s &quot;The Politician&quot;. In the show, they are performing in a school production of the musical, which parallels events occurring in their own lives. The episode included a cover of &quot;Unworthy of Your Love&quot;, sung by Ben Platt and Zoey Deutch.

== Awards and nominations ==

=== Original Off-Broadway production ===
=== Original London production ===
=== Original Broadway production ===
Although &quot;Assassins&quot; had not run on Broadway prior to 2004, the 1992 London production and 1991 Off-Broadway production led to a ruling by the Tony Awards Administration Committee that the musical is a revival instead of an original musical.

=== 2014 Off-West End production ===
=== 2021 Off-Broadway Revival ===
== Recordings ==
Recordings of both the Off-Broadway production and the 2004 revival were released. The original Off-Broadway version lacks the song &quot;Something Just Broke&quot;, which was added to the show for the subsequent London production. The 1990 recording does however include the full 11-minute spoken-word climactic scene &quot;November 22, 1963&quot;. The 2004 Broadway recording adds &quot;Something Just Broke&quot; and several dialogue sections but only includes the second half of the &quot;November 1963&quot; scene.

While the original Off-Broadway production used just three musicians, the 1990 cast album was fully orchestrated by Michael Starobin, with 33 musicians directed by Paul Gemignani.

The 2021 Off-Broadway revival received its own cast recording on March 18, 2022, making it the third English language recording of the show. It includes the full score, and features the actor-musician cast members playing their respective instruments.
