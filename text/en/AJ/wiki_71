<text>James Longstreet (January 8, 1821January 2, 1904) was a Confederate general during the American Civil War and was the principal subordinate to General Robert E. Lee, who called him his &quot;Old War Horse&quot;. He served under Lee as a corps commander for most of the battles fought by the Army of Northern Virginia in the Eastern Theater, and briefly with Braxton Bragg in the Army of Tennessee in the Western Theater.

After graduating from the United States Military Academy at West Point, Longstreet served in the United States Army during the Mexican–American War. He was wounded at the Battle of Chapultepec, and during recovery married his first wife, Louise Garland. Throughout the 1850s, he served on frontier duty in the American Southwest. In June 1861, Longstreet resigned his U.S. Army commission and joined the Confederate Army. He commanded Confederate troops during an early victory at Blackburn&#x27;s Ford in July and played a minor role at the First Battle of Bull Run.

Longstreet made significant contributions to most major Confederate victories, primarily in the Eastern Theater as one of Robert E. Lee&#x27;s chief subordinates in the Army of Northern Virginia. He performed poorly at Seven Pines by accidentally marching his men down the wrong road, causing them to arrive late, but played an important role in the Confederate success of the Seven Days Battles in the summer of 1862, where he helped supervise repeated attacks that drove the Union army away from the Confederate capital of Richmond. Longstreet led a devastating counterattack that routed the Union army at Second Bull Run in August. His men held their ground in defensive roles at Antietam and Fredericksburg. He did not participate in the Confederate victory at Chancellorsville, as he and most of his soldiers had been detached on the comparatively minor Siege of Suffolk. Longstreet&#x27;s most controversial service was at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, where he openly disagreed with Lee on the tactics to be employed and reluctantly supervised several unsuccessful attacks on Union forces. Afterward, Longstreet was, at his own request, sent to the Western Theater to fight under Braxton Bragg, where his troops launched a ferocious assault on the Union lines at Chickamauga that carried the day. Afterward, his performance in semi-autonomous command during the Knoxville campaign resulted in a Confederate defeat. Longstreet&#x27;s tenure in the Western Theater was marred by his central role in numerous conflicts amongst Confederate generals. Unhappy serving under Bragg, Longstreet and his men were sent back to Lee. He ably commanded troops during the Battle of the Wilderness in 1864, where he was seriously wounded by friendly fire. He later returned to the field, serving under Lee in the Siege of Petersburg and the Appomattox campaign.

Longstreet enjoyed a successful post-war career working for the U.S. government as a diplomat, civil servant, and administrator. His support for the Republican Party and his cooperation with his pre-war friend President Ulysses S. Grant, as well as critical comments he wrote about Lee&#x27;s wartime performance, made him anathema to many of his former Confederate colleagues. His reputation in the South further suffered when he led African-American militia against the anti-Reconstruction White League at the Battle of Liberty Place in 1874. Authors of the Lost Cause movement focused on Longstreet&#x27;s actions at Gettysburg as a principal reason for why the South lost the Civil War. As an elderly man, he married Helen Dortch Longstreet, who worked to restore her husband&#x27;s image after his death. Since the late 20th century, Longstreet&#x27;s reputation has undergone a slow reassessment. Many Civil War historians now consider him among the war&#x27;s most gifted tactical commanders.

==Early life==
===Childhood===
James Longstreet was born on January 8, 1821, in Edgefield District, South Carolina, now part of North Augusta, Edgefield County. He was the fifth child and third son of James Longstreet, of Dutch descent, and Mary Ann Dent of English descent, originally from New Jersey and Maryland respectively, who owned a cotton plantation close to where the village of Gainesville would be founded in northeastern Georgia. James&#x27;s ancestor Dirck Stoffels Langestraet immigrated to the Dutch colony of New Netherland in 1657, but the name was Anglicized over the generations. The family was moderately prosperous and held dozens of slaves. James&#x27;s father was impressed by his son&#x27;s &quot;rocklike&quot; character, giving him the nickname Peter, and he was known as Pete or Old Pete for the rest of his life. Longstreet&#x27;s father decided on a military career for his son but felt that the available local education would not be adequate preparation. At age nine, James was sent to live with his aunt Frances Eliza and uncle Augustus Baldwin Longstreet in Augusta, Georgia. James spent eight years on his uncle&#x27;s plantation, Westover, just outside the city while he attended the Academy of Richmond County. His father died from a cholera epidemic while visiting Augusta in 1833. Although James&#x27;s mother and the rest of the family moved to Somerville, Alabama, following his father&#x27;s death, James remained with his uncle.

As a boy, Longstreet enjoyed swimming, hunting, fishing, and riding horses. He became adept at shooting firearms. Northern Georgia was very rural frontier territory, and Southern aristocratic traditions had not yet taken hold. As a result, Longstreet&#x27;s manners were sometimes rather rough in spite of his plantation background. He dressed unceremoniously and at times used coarse language, although not in the presence of women. In later life, Longstreet described his aunt and uncle as caring and loving. He made no known political statements before the war and appears to have been largely uninterested in politics. But Augustus, as a lawyer, judge, newspaper editor, and Methodist minister, was a fierce states&#x27; rights partisan who supported South Carolina during the Nullification crisis (1828–1833), ideas to which Longstreet probably would have been exposed. Augustus was also known for drinking whiskey and playing cards at a time when many Americans considered them immoral, habits he passed on to Longstreet.

===West Point and early military service===
In 1837, Augustus attempted to obtain an appointment for his nephew to the United States Military Academy, but the vacancy for his congressional district had already been filled. Longstreet was appointed the following year by a relative, Reuben Chapman, who represented the First District of Alabama, where Mary Longstreet lived. Longstreet was a poor student. By his own admission in his memoirs, he &quot;had more interest in the school of the soldier, horsemanship, exercise, and the outside game of foot-ball than in the academic courses&quot;.

Longstreet ranked in the bottom third of every subject during his four years at the academy. In January of his third year, Longstreet initially failed his mechanics exam, but took a second test two days later and passed. Longstreet&#x27;s engineering instructor in his fourth year was Dennis Hart Mahan, who stressed swift maneuvering, protection of interior lines, and positioning troops in strategic points rather than attempting to destroy the enemy&#x27;s army outright. Although Longstreet earned modest grades in the course, he used similar tactics during the Civil War. Longstreet was also a disciplinary problem at West Point. He earned a large number of demerits, especially in his final two years. His offenses included visiting after taps, absence at roll call, an untidy room, long hair, causing a disturbance during study time, and disobeying orders. Biographer Jeffry D. Wert says, &quot;Longstreet was neither a model student nor a gentleman.&quot;

Longstreet was popular with his classmates, however, and befriended a number of men who would become prominent during the Civil War, including George Henry Thomas, William Rosecrans (his roommate), John Pope, Daniel Harvey Hill, Lafayette McLaws, George Pickett, and Ulysses S. Grant. Longstreet ranked 54th out of 56 cadets when he graduated in 1842. He was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the United States Army.

After a brief furlough, Longstreet was stationed for two years at the 4th U.S. Infantry at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, under the command of Lieutenant colonel John Garland. In 1843, he was joined by his friend, Lieutenant Ulysses Grant. In 1844, Longstreet met Garland&#x27;s daughter and his future first wife Maria Louisa Garland, called Louise by her family. At about the same time as Longstreet began courting Louise, Grant courted Longstreet&#x27;s fourth cousin, Julia Dent, and that couple eventually married. Longstreet attended the Grant wedding on August 22, 1848, in St. Louis, but his role at the ceremony remains unclear. Grant biographers Jean Edward Smith and Ron Chernow state that Longstreet served as best man. John Y. Simon, editor of Julia Grant&#x27;s memoirs, concluded that Longstreet &quot;may have been a groomsman&quot;, and Longstreet biographer Donald Brigman Sanger called the role of best man &quot;uncertain&quot; while noting that neither Grant nor Longstreet mentioned such a role in their memoirs.

Later in 1844, the regiment, along with the Third Infantry, was transferred to Camp Salubrity near Natchitoches, Louisiana, as part of the Army of Observation under Major General Zachary Taylor. On March 8, 1845, Longstreet was promoted to second lieutenant and transferred to the Eighth Infantry, stationed at Fort Marion in St. Augustine, Florida. He served for the month of August on court-martial duty in Pensacola. The regiment was then transferred to Corpus Christi, Texas, where he was reunited with the officers of the Third and Fourth Regiments, including Grant. The men passed the winter by staging plays.

==Mexican–American War==
Longstreet served with distinction in the Mexican–American War with the 8th U.S. Infantry. He fought under Zachary Taylor as a lieutenant in May 1846 in the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma. He recounted both of these battles in his memoirs but wrote nothing about his personal role in them. On June 10, Longstreet was given command of Company A of the Eighth Infantry of William J. Worth&#x27;s Second Division. He fought again with Taylor&#x27;s army at the Battle of Monterrey in September 1846, during which about 200 Mexican lancers drove back a group of American troops. Longstreet, commanding companies A and B, led a counterattack, killing or wounding almost half of the lancers.

On February 23, 1847, he was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant. General-in-Chief Winfield Scott ordered Worth&#x27;s division out of Taylor&#x27;s army and under his direct command to participate in an assault on the Mexican capital of Mexico City. Worth&#x27;s division was sent first to Lobos Island, then sailed 180 miles (289.7 km) south to Veracruz. Worth led Scott&#x27;s army in its amphibious approach on the city, arriving there on March 9. Scott besieged the city and subjected it to regular bombardments. It surrendered on March 29. The American army then marched north towards the capital. In August, Longstreet served in the Battle of Churubusco, a pivotal battle as the U.S. Army moved closer to capturing Mexico City. The Eighth Infantry was the only force in Worth&#x27;s division to reach the Mexican earthworks. Longstreet carried the regimental banner under heavy Mexican fire. The troops found themselves stuck in a ditch and could only scale the Mexican defenses by standing on each other. In the fierce hand-to-hand combat that ensued, the Americans prevailed. Longstreet received a brevet promotion to captain for his actions.

He received a brevet promotion to major for Molino del Rey. In the Battle of Chapultepec on September 12, he was wounded in the thigh while charging up the hill with his regimental colors; falling, he handed the flag to his friend Lt. Pickett, who was able to reach the summit. The capture of the Chapultepec fortress led to the fall of Mexico City. Longstreet recovered in the home of the Escandón family, which treated wounded American soldiers. His wound was slow to heal and he did not leave until December. After a brief visit with his family, Longstreet went to Missouri to see Louise.

==Subsequent activities==

After the war and his recovery, Longstreet and Louise Garland were officially married on March 8, 1848. The marriage produced 10 children. Little is known of their courtship or marriage. Longstreet rarely mentions her in his memoirs, and never reveals any personal details. There are no surviving letters between the two. Most anecdotes about their relationship come through the writings of Longstreet&#x27;s second wife, Helen Dortch Longstreet. Novelist Ben Ames Williams, a descendant of Longstreet, included Longstreet as a minor character in two novels. Williams questioned Longstreet&#x27;s surviving children and grandchildren, and depicted him as a devoted family man with an exceptionally happy marriage.

Longstreet next served several months of recruiting duty in Poughkeepsie, New York. After travelling to St. Louis for the Grant wedding, Longstreet and his wife moved to Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania. On January 1, 1850, he was appointed Chief Commissary for the Department of Texas, responsible for the acquisition and distribution of food to the department&#x27;s soldiers and animals. The job was complex and consisted mainly of paperwork, although it provided experience in administrative military work. 1850 census records show that Longstreet owned two slaves, a 35-year old woman and a 13-year old girl. In June, Longstreet, hoping for promotion and an income above his $40-per-month salary to support his growing family, requested a transfer to the cavalry but was rejected. He resigned as commissary in March 1851 and returned to the Eighth Infantry. Longstreet served on frontier duty in Texas at Fort Martin Scott near Fredericksburg. The primary purpose of the military in Texas was to protect frontier communities against Indians, and Longstreet frequently participated in scouting missions against the Comanche. His family remained in San Antonio, and he saw them regularly. In 1854, he was transferred to Fort Bliss in El Paso, and Louise and the children moved in with him. In 1855, Longstreet was involved in fighting against the Mescalero. He assumed command of the garrison at Fort Bliss on two occasions between the spring of 1856 and the spring of 1858. The small size of the garrison allowed for easy socialization with the local people, and the fort&#x27;s location allowed for visits with Louise&#x27;s parents in Santa Fe. Longstreet performed scouting missions.

On March 29, 1858, Longstreet wrote to the adjutant general&#x27;s office in Washington, D.C. requesting that he be assigned to recruiting duty in the East, which would allow him to better educate his children. He was granted a six-month leave, but the request for assignment in the East was denied, and he was instead directed to serve as major and paymaster for the 8th Infantry in Leavenworth, Kansas. He left his son Garland in a school at Yonkers, New York, before journeying to Kansas. On the way, Longstreet came across his old friend Grant in St. Louis, Missouri. After about a year in Leavenworth he was transferred to Colonel Garland&#x27;s department in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to serve as paymaster, where he was joined by Louise and their children.

Knowledge of Longstreet&#x27;s prewar life is extremely limited. His experience resembles that of many Civil War generals insofar as he went to West Point, served with distinction in the War with Mexico, and continued his career in the peacetime army of the 1850s. But beyond that, there are few details. He left no diary, and his lengthy memoirs focus almost entirely on recounting and defending his Civil War military record. They reveal little of his personal side while providing only a very cursory view of his pre-war activities. An 1889 fire destroyed his personal papers, making it so that the number of &quot;[e]xisting antebellum private letters written by Longstreet [could] be counted on one hand&quot;.

==American Civil War==
===Joining the Confederacy and initial hostilities===
At the beginning of the American Civil War, Longstreet was paymaster for the United States Army and stationed in Albuquerque. After news of the Battle of Fort Sumter, he joined his fellow Southerners in leaving the post. In his memoirs, Longstreet calls it a &quot;sad day&quot;, and records that a number of Northern officers attempted to persuade him not to go. He writes that he asked one of them &quot;what course he would pursue if his State should pass ordinances of secession and call him to its defence. He confessed that he would obey the call.&quot;

Longstreet was not enthusiastic about secession from the Union, but he had long been infused with the concept of states&#x27; rights and felt he could not go against his homeland. Although he was born in South Carolina and brought up in Georgia, he offered his services to Alabama, which had appointed him to West Point and where his mother still lived. He was the senior West Point graduate from that state, which meant that he could potentially be placed in command of that state&#x27;s soldiers. After settling his accounts, he submitted his resignation letter from the United States Army on May 9, 1861, intending to join the Confederacy. He had already accepted a commission as a lieutenant colonel in the Confederate States Army on May 1. His resignation from the United States Army was accepted on June 1.
Longstreet arrived in Richmond, Virginia, with his new commission. He met with Confederate President Jefferson Davis at the executive mansion on June 22, 1861, where he was informed that he had been appointed a brigadier general with the date of rank on June 17, a commission he accepted on June 25. He was ordered to report to Brigadier General P. G. T. Beauregard at Manassas, where he was given command of a brigade of three Virginia regiments—the 1st, 11th, and 17th Virginia Infantry—in the Confederate Army of the Potomac.

Longstreet assembled his staff and trained his brigade incessantly. On July 16, Union Brigadier General Irvin McDowell began marching his army toward Manassas Junction. Longstreet&#x27;s brigade first saw action at Blackburn&#x27;s Ford on July 18, when it collided with McDowell&#x27;s advance division under Brigadier General Daniel Tyler, clashing heavily with the brigade of Israel B. Richardson. An infantry charge pushed Longstreet&#x27;s men back, and in his own words, Longstreet &quot;rode with sabre in hand for the leading files, determined to give them all that was in the sword and my horse&#x27;s heels, or stop the break&quot;. Colonel Jubal Early&#x27;s brigade arrived to reinforce Longstreet. One of Early&#x27;s regiments, the 7th Virginia, fired a volley while Longstreet was still in front of its position, forcing him to dive off of his horse. Under the renewed Confederate strength, the Union left wavered. Tyler withdrew, as he had orders not to bring on a general engagement.

The battle preceded the First Battle of Bull Run (First Manassas). When the main attack came at the opposite end of the line on July 21, Longstreet&#x27;s brigade endured artillery fire for nine hours but played a minor role in the fighting. Between 5 and 6 in the evening, Longstreet received an order from Brigadier General Joseph E. Johnston instructing him to take part in the pursuit of the Federal troops, who had been defeated and were fleeing the battlefield. He obeyed, but when he met Brigadier General Milledge Bonham&#x27;s brigade, Bonham, who outranked Longstreet, ordered him to retreat. The same order soon arrived from Johnston. Longstreet was infuriated that his commanders would not allow a vigorous pursuit of the defeated Union Army. His Chief of Staff, Moxley Sorrel, recorded that he was &quot;in a fine rage. He dashed his hat furiously to the ground, stamped, and bitter words escaped him.&quot; He quoted Longstreet as saying afterward, &quot;Retreat! Hell, the Federal army has broken to pieces.&quot;

On October 7, Longstreet was promoted to major general and assumed command of a division in the newly reorganized and renamed Confederate Army of Northern Virginia under Johnston (formed from the previous Army of the Potomac and the Army of the Shenandoah) – with four infantry brigades commanded by Generals D.H. Hill, David R. Jones, Bonham, and Louis Wigfall, as well as Hampton&#x27;s Legion commanded by Wade Hampton III.

===Family tragedy===
On January 10, 1862, Longstreet traveled under orders from Johnston to Richmond, where he discussed with Davis the creation of a conscription program. He spent much of the intervening time with Louise and their children, and was back at army headquarters in Centreville by January 20. A day or two later, he received a telegram informing him that all four of his children were extremely sick in an outbreak of scarlet fever. Longstreet immediately returned to the city.

Longstreet arrived in Richmond before the death of his one-year-old daughter Mary Anne on January 25. Four-year-old James died the following day. Eleven-year-old Augustus Baldwin (&quot;Gus&quot;) died on February 1. His 13-year-old son Garland remained ill but appeared to be out of mortal danger. George Pickett and his future wife LaSalle Corbell were in the Longstreets&#x27; company throughout the affair. They arranged the funeral and burials, which for unknown reasons neither Longstreet nor his wife attended. Longstreet returned to the army on February 5. He rushed back to Richmond later in the month when Garland took a turn for the worse, but came back after he recovered. The losses were devastating for Longstreet and he became withdrawn, both personally and socially. In 1861, his headquarters were noted for parties, drinking, and poker games. After he returned, the headquarters social life became for a time more somber. He rarely drank, and his religious devotion increased.

===Peninsula===

That spring, Union Major General George B. McClellan, commander of the Army of the Potomac, launched the Peninsula campaign intending to capture the Confederate capital of Richmond. In his memoirs, Longstreet wrote that while in temporary command of the Confederate army, he proposed to Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson that he march to Jackson in the Shenandoah Valley and combine forces. No evidence has emerged for this claim.

Following the delay of the Union offensive against Richmond at the Siege of Yorktown, Johnston oversaw a tactical withdrawal to the outskirts of Richmond, where defenses had already been prepared. Longstreet&#x27;s division formed the rearguard, which was heavily engaged at the Battle of Williamsburg on May 5. There, Union troops beginning with Joseph Hooker&#x27;s division of the Union III Corps, which was commanded by Samuel P. Heintzelman, came out of a forest into open ground to attack Longstreet&#x27;s men. To protect the army&#x27;s supply wagons, Longstreet counterattacked with the brigades of Cadmus M. Wilcox, A. P. Hill, Pickett, Raleigh E. Colston, and two other regiments. The assault drove the Union soldiers back. Finding the ground he occupied untenable, Longstreet requested reinforcements from D.H. Hill&#x27;s division a little further up the road and received Early&#x27;s brigade, to which was later added the entire division. Early then launched a fruitless and bloody attack well after the wagons had already been safely evacuated. Overall, the battle was a success, protecting the passage of Confederate supply wagons and delaying the advance of McClellan&#x27;s army toward Richmond. The affair gave the Confederates possession of four cannon. McClellan inaccurately characterized the battle as a Union victory in a dispatch to Washington.
On May 31, during the Battle of Seven Pines, Longstreet received his orders verbally from Johnston but apparently misremembered them. He marched his men in the wrong direction down the wrong road, causing congestion and confusion with other Confederate units, diluting the effect of the Confederate counterattack against McClellan. He then got into an argument with Major General Benjamin Huger over who had seniority, causing a significant delay. When D.H. Hill subsequently asked Longstreet for reinforcements, he complied, but failed to properly coordinate his brigades. Only one of Longstreet&#x27;s brigades and none of Huger&#x27;s reached the field. Late in the day, Major General Edwin Vose Sumner crossed the rain-swollen Chickahominy River with two divisions. General Johnston was wounded during the battle. Although Johnston preferred Longstreet as his replacement, command of the Army of Northern Virginia shifted to G. W. Smith, the senior major general, for a single day. On June 1, Richardson&#x27;s division of Sumner&#x27;s corps engaged Longstreet&#x27;s men, routing Lewis Armistead&#x27;s brigade, but the brigades of Pickett, William Mahone, and Roger Atkinson Pryor positioned in the woods managed to hold it back. After six hours of fighting, the battle ended in a draw. Johnston praised Longstreet&#x27;s performance in the battle. Biographer William Garrett Piston calls it &quot;the lowest point in Longstreet&#x27;s military career&quot;. Longstreet&#x27;s report unfairly blamed Huger for the mishaps. On June 1, the President&#x27;s military advisor Robert E. Lee assumed command of the Army of Northern Virginia. In his memoirs, Longstreet suggested that he initially doubted Lee&#x27;s capacity for command. He wrote that his arrival &quot;was far from reconciling the troops to the loss of our beloved chief, Joseph E. Johnston&quot;. He wrote that Lee did not have much of a reputation at the time that he took command and that there were therefore &quot;misgivings&quot; about Lee&#x27;s &quot;power and skill for field service&quot;.

In late June, Lee organized a plan to drive McClellan&#x27;s army away from the capital, which culminated in the Seven Days Battles. At daybreak on June 27 at Gaines&#x27;s Mill, the Confederate Army attacked the V Corps of the Union Army under Brigadier General Fitz John Porter, which was positioned north of the Chickahominy River on McClellan&#x27;s right flank. Federal troops held their lines for most of the day against attacks from the divisions of A.P. Hill and D.H. Hill, and Jackson did not arrive until the afternoon. At about 5 P.M., Longstreet received orders from Lee to join the battle. Longstreet&#x27;s fresh brigades under Pickett and Richard H. Anderson, accompanied by the brigades of Brigadier General John Bell Hood and Colonel Evander M. Law from William H.C. Whiting&#x27;s division, charged the Union lines, forcing them to retreat across the Chickahominy. Longstreet was engaged again on June 30 with about 20,000 men at Glendale. He departed from his usual strategy of placing troops several lines deep and instead spread them out, which in the opinion of some military historians cost him the battle. His efforts were further damaged by the slowness of other Confederate commanders, and McClellan was able to withdraw his army to the high plateau of Malvern Hill. Jackson, engaged at White Oak Swamp, ignored reports of ways in which to cross the swamp, and refused to answer an inquiry from Longstreet&#x27;s staff officer John Fairfax. Huger&#x27;s advance was slow enough to allow Federal troops to be transported away from guarding him and towards Longstreet, and Theophilus Holmes also performed poorly. Nearly 50,000 Confederate troops stood within a few miles of the field at Glendale and rendered little to no assistance. In a reconnaissance on the evening of June 30, Longstreet reported to Lee that conditions were favorable enough to justify assault. At the Battle of Malvern Hill the next day, Longstreet surrendered A.P. Hill&#x27;s entire division to John B. Magruder, and marched his remaining troops toward the Union positions on the Confederate extreme right. His men were exposed to fire on their flanks from McClellan&#x27;s troops and were forced to withdraw without success.

Throughout the Seven Days Battles, Longstreet had operational command of nearly half of Lee&#x27;s army—15 brigades—as it drove McClellan back down the Peninsula. Longstreet performed aggressively and quite well in his new, larger command, particularly at Gaines&#x27;s Mill and Glendale. Lee&#x27;s army suffered from poor maps, organizational flaws, and weak performances by Longstreet&#x27;s peers, including, uncharacteristically, Stonewall Jackson, and was unable to destroy the Union army. Moxley Sorrel wrote of Longstreet&#x27;s confidence and calmness in battle: &quot;He was like a rock in steadiness when sometimes in battle the world seemed flying to pieces.&quot; General Lee said shortly after Seven Days, &quot;Longstreet was the staff in my right hand.&quot; He had been established as Lee&#x27;s principal lieutenant. Lee reorganized the Army of Northern Virginia after Seven Days, increasing Longstreet&#x27;s command from six brigades to 28. Longstreet took command of the Right Wing (later known as the First Corps) and Jackson was given command of the Left Wing. Over time, Lee and Longstreet became good friends and set up headquarters very near each other. Despite sharing with Jackson a belief in temperance as well as a deep religious conviction, Lee never developed as strong a friendship with him. Piston speculates that the more relaxed atmosphere of Longstreet&#x27;s headquarters, which included gambling and drinking, allowed Lee to relax and take his mind off the war, and reminded him of his happier younger days.

After the campaign, an editorial appeared in the &quot;Richmond Examiner&quot; inaccurately claiming that the Battle of Glendale &quot;was fought exclusively by General A.P. Hill and the forces under his command&quot;. Longstreet drafted a letter refuting the article, which was published in the &quot;Richmond Whig.&quot; Hill took offense and requested that his division be transferred out of Longstreet&#x27;s command. Longstreet agreed, but Lee took no action. Then, Hill refused to accede to Longstreet&#x27;s repeated requests for information and was eventually arrested on Longstreet&#x27;s orders. He challenged Longstreet to a duel. Longstreet accepted, but Lee intervened and transferred Hill&#x27;s division into Jackson&#x27;s command.

===Second Bull Run===
The military reputations of Lee&#x27;s corps commanders are often characterized as Stonewall Jackson representing the audacious, offensive component of Lee&#x27;s army, with Longstreet more typically advocating and executing strong defensive strategies and tactics. Wert describes Jackson as the hammer and Longstreet as the anvil of the army. In the first part of the Northern Virginia campaign of August 1862, this stereotype held true, but in the climactic battle, it did not. In June, the Federal Government created the 50,000-strong Army of Virginia, and put Major General John Pope in command. Pope moved south in an attempt to attack Lee and threaten Richmond through an overland march. Lee left Longstreet near Richmond to guard the city and dispatched Jackson to hinder Pope&#x27;s advance. Jackson won a major victory at the Battle of Cedar Mountain. After learning that McClellan, as ordered, had dispatched troops north to assist Pope, Lee ordered Longstreet north as well, leaving only three divisions under G.W. Smith to protect Richmond against McClellan&#x27;s reduced force. Longstreet&#x27;s men began their march on August 17, aided by Stuart&#x27;s cavalry. On August 23, Longstreet engaged Pope&#x27;s position in a minor artillery duel at the First Battle of Rappahannock Station. The Confederate Washington Artillery was heavily damaged and a Union shell landed feet away from Longstreet and Wilcox but failed to explode. Meanwhile, Stuart&#x27;s cavalry rode around the Army of Virginia and captured hundreds of soldiers and horses as well as some of Pope&#x27;s personal belongings.

Jackson executed a sweeping flanking maneuver that captured Pope&#x27;s main supply depot. He placed his corps in the rear of Pope&#x27;s army, but he then took up a defensive position and effectively invited Pope to assault him. On August 28 and 29, the start of the Second Battle of Bull Run (Second Manassas), Pope pounded Jackson as Longstreet and the remainder of the army marched from the west, through Thoroughfare Gap, to reach the battlefield. On the afternoon of the 28th, Longstreet engaged a 5,000-man federal division under James B. Ricketts at the Battle of Thoroughfare Gap. Ricketts had been ordered to delay Longstreet&#x27;s march towards the main Confederate army, but he took up his position too late, allowing George T. Anderson&#x27;s brigade to occupy the high ground. Lee and Longstreet watched the battle together and decided to flank the Union position. Hood&#x27;s division and a brigade under Henry L. Benning advanced towards the gap from the north and the south, respectively, while Wilcox&#x27;s division followed in a six-mile march northward. Ricketts realized his position was untenable and withdrew that evening, allowing Longstreet to join up with the rest of Lee&#x27;s army. Postwar criticism of Longstreet claimed that he marched his men too slowly, leaving Jackson to bear the brunt of the fighting for two days, but they covered roughly in a little over 24 hours and Lee did not attempt to get his army concentrated any faster.

When Longstreet&#x27;s men arrived on the field around midday on August 29, Lee planned a flanking attack on the Union Army, which was concentrating its attention on Jackson. Longstreet demurred to three suggestions from Lee urging him to attack, recommending instead a reconnaissance in force to survey the ground in front of him. This confirmed the presence of Porter&#x27;s V Corps in front of his lines. By 6:30 P.M., Hood&#x27;s division moved forward against Porter and drove back the soldiers it encountered, but had to be withdrawn at night when it advanced too far ahead of the main lines. Despite the smashing victory that followed, Longstreet was eventually criticized for allegedly being slow, reluctant to attack, and disobedient to General Lee. Lee&#x27;s biographer, Douglas Southall Freeman, wrote: &quot;The seeds of much of the disaster at Gettysburg were sown in that instant—when Lee yielded to Longstreet and Longstreet discovered that he would.&quot; Wert disputes this conclusion, pointing out that in a post-war letter to Longstreet, Porter told him that had he attacked him that day, Longstreet&#x27;s &quot;loss would have been enormous&quot;.
Despite this criticism, the following day was, according to Wert, one of Longstreet&#x27;s finest performances of the war. After his attacks on the 29th, Pope came to believe with little evidence that Jackson was in retreat. He ordered a reluctant Porter to pursue, and his corps collided with Jackson&#x27;s men and suffered heavy casualties. The attack exposed the Union left flank, and Longstreet took advantage of this by launching a massive assault on the Union flank with over 25,000 men. For over four hours they &quot;pounded like a giant hammer&quot; with Longstreet actively directing artillery fire and sending brigades into the fray. Longstreet and Lee were together during the assault and both of them came under Union artillery fire. Although the Union troops put up a furious defense, Pope&#x27;s army was forced to retreat in a manner similar to the embarrassing Union defeat at First Bull Run, fought on roughly the same battleground. Longstreet gave the credit for the victory to Lee, describing the campaign as &quot;clever and brilliant&quot;. It established a strategic model he believed to be ideal—the use of defensive tactics within a strategic offensive. On September 1, Jackson&#x27;s corps moved to cut off the Union retreat at the Battle of Chantilly. Longstreet&#x27;s men remained on the field to fool Pope into thinking that Lee&#x27;s entire army was still on his front.

===Antietam===
After the Confederate success at Second Manassas, Lee, holding the strategic initiative, decided to take the war to Maryland to relieve Virginia and hopefully induce foreign nations to come to the Confederates&#x27; aid. Longstreet supported the plan. &quot;The situation called for action&quot;, he later said, &quot;and there was but one opening – across the Potomac.&quot; His men crossed into Maryland on September 6 and arrived in Frederick the following day, beginning the Maryland campaign. At the Battle of Antietam (Sharpsburg) on September 17, rather than commit his forces all at once, McClellan made a series of partial attacks on Confederate troops at different places throughout the day while holding many of his troops, including the entire V Corps, in reserve. At dawn, Hood&#x27;s division on the Confederate left was driven back by an assault from Hooker&#x27;s and Joseph K. Mansfield&#x27;s corps until reinforced by men from Jackson&#x27;s command. More troops from both sides soon poured into the fighting, which raged for three hours. At the center of the field, D.H. Hill&#x27;s division defended a 600-yard (548.6 meters) position dominated by a sunken wagon path. The position was naturally strong, made more so by the piling of planks from a wooden fence at the top of the ditch, and Hill&#x27;s men firmly repulsed two successive charges from the Union divisions of William H. French and Richardson. Hill suffered significant casualties, and Longstreet sent R.H. Anderson&#x27;s division, which consisted of 3,500 men, to reinforce him. Anderson was wounded and replaced by Pryor. At Pryor&#x27;s request, Longstreet sent artillery support in response to Union cannon being fired at Confederates in the road from across Antietam Creek. He also ordered a flanking movement by about 900 soldiers in several regiments led by Colonel John Rogers Cooke. Union troops arrested Cooke&#x27;s advance. An intense fight followed, and Cooke withdrew after his ammunition was expended. A mistaken order allowed Union troops to breach the Confederate position at the sunken road, but Confederate lines were stabilized.

At this point in the afternoon, fighting largely ceased except for on the Confederate right. The Union left-wing under Major General Ambrose Burnside attempted to cross the Antietam Creek at what would become known as Burnside&#x27;s Bridge, while Jones&#x27; division led by Brigadier General Robert Toombs&#x27;s brigade defended the heights on the western side of the creek. For hours, the Union troops tried to cross the river and failed five times. Finally at 4 P.M., a flanking maneuver forced Toombs to withdraw. After the further engagement, the remainder of Jones&#x27; division was forced to give way, and Burnside&#x27;s men occupied the crest overlooking the river before pressing their advantage. Their progress was arrested by the arrival of A.P. Hill&#x27;s division under Jackson from Harpers Ferry. Fighting ensued in the town of Sharpsburg until Burnside withdrew his men at dusk. The Confederates pursued their enemy but stopped once the retreating troops came under the protection of a battery on the opposite side of the river, ending the Battle of Antietam after 18 hours of fighting. At the end of that bloodiest day of the Civil War, Lee greeted his subordinate by saying, &quot;Ah! Here is Longstreet; here&#x27;s my old &quot;war-horse!&quot;&quot; Lee held his ground at Antietam until the evening of September 18, when he withdrew his army from the battlefield and took it back across the Potomac and into Virginia. On October 9, a few weeks after Antietam, Longstreet was promoted to lieutenant general. Lee arranged for Longstreet&#x27;s promotion to be dated one day earlier than Jackson&#x27;s, making the Old War-Horse the senior lieutenant general in the Army of Northern Virginia. In an army reorganization in November, Longstreet&#x27;s command was designated the First Corps, and Jackson&#x27;s the Second Corps. The First Corps consisted of five divisions, approximately 41,000 men. The divisions were commanded by Lafayette McLaws, R.H. Anderson, Hood, Pickett, and Robert Ransom Jr.

===Fredericksburg===
After a lengthy interlude with little military activity, beginning on October 26, McClellan marched his army across the Potomac River. On November 7, Lincoln replaced McClellan with Burnside. On November 15, Burnside began moving his army south towards Fredericksburg, Virginia, midway between the opposing capitals. On November 18, Longstreet began marching his men out of army headquarters in Culpeper towards Fredericksburg, where the Confederate army would make its stand against Burnside. Since Lee moved Longstreet to Fredericksburg early, it allowed Longstreet to build strong defenses. Longstreet ordered trenches, abatis, and fieldworks to be constructed south of the town along a stone wall at the foot of Marye&#x27;s Heights. After a lengthy delay, caused by waiting for the arrival of supplies to build pontoon bridges, Burnside attempted to cross the Rappahannock on December 11. Soldiers attempting to lay pontoon bridges encountered fierce resistance from Confederate troops inside Fredericksburg, led by William Barksdale&#x27;s brigade of McLaws&#x27; division. Burnside subsequently ordered an artillery bombardment of the town, and by the following day had moved his army across and occupied Fredericksburg. December 12 saw only a small amount of desultory fighting.

Longstreet had his men firmly entrenched. On December 13, under Burnside&#x27;s orders, troops from the Union Right Grand Division under Sumner and the Center Grand Division under Hooker undertook to carry the position held by Longstreet&#x27;s troops, who, contrary to some of their expectations, found themselves at the center of the battle. The first Union assault on Longstreet&#x27;s men at Marye&#x27;s Heights was a disastrous failure, causing approximately 1,000 casualties within 30 minutes. When Lee expressed apprehension that the Federal troops might overrun Longstreet&#x27;s men, Longstreet replied that as long as he had sufficient ammunition he would &quot;kill them all&quot; before any of them reached his line. He advised him to look towards Jackson&#x27;s more tenuous position to the right. Longstreet was proven correct, as from their strong position his troops easily repulsed several assaults. In some places behind the stone wall, Confederate ranks were four to five troops deep. Soldiers in the rear loaded rifles and passed them up to the front, so that the fire was virtually continuous. Confederate troops were well protected, although they did suffer one notable casualty when Brigadier General Thomas Reade Rootes Cobb, who commanded a brigade in McLaws&#x27; division that was positioned at the front of the stone wall, was killed. One Union general compared the scene before Marye&#x27;s Heights to &quot;a great slaughter pen&quot; and said that his men &quot;might as well have tried to take Hell&quot;. McLaws estimated that only one Union soldier lay dead within 30 yards of the wall, the rest having fallen much farther back. Jackson, meanwhile, managed with much greater difficulty to repel a strong Union assault spearheaded by the division of George Meade. Sensing that the rest of his troops would be adequate to defend his position on the Confederate left on the heights, Longstreet had ordered Hood to reinforce Jackson, and Pickett to cooperate with him, but Hood hesitated in sending his division forward, and by the time he did, the fighting on Jackson&#x27;s front had mostly ended. Longstreet expressed regret after the war for &quot;not bringing the delinquent [Hood] to trial&quot;.

Burnside intended to attack again the next day, but several of his officers, particularly Sumner, advised against it. He entrenched his men instead and withdrew on December 15. In Longstreet&#x27;s report, he praised his men and officers while asking them to contribute money for the residents of Fredericksburg. Lee&#x27;s report strongly commended Jackson and Longstreet. Burnside&#x27;s army had suffered 12,653 casualties at Fredericksburg. About 70% of them were in front of Marye&#x27;s Heights. Lee suffered only about 5,300 losses, about 1,900 of which came from Longstreet. Lt. Col. Edward Porter Alexander of the artillery described Fredericksburg as &quot;the easiest battle we ever fought.&quot;

===Suffolk===

In October 1862, Longstreet had suggested to Joe Johnston that he be sent to fight in the war&#x27;s Western Theater. Shortly after Fredericksburg, Longstreet vaguely suggested to Lee that &quot;one corps could hold the line of the Rappahannock while the other was operating elsewhere&quot;. In February 1863, he made a more specific request, suggesting to Wigfall that his corps be detached from the Army of Northern Virginia and sent to reinforce the Army of Tennessee, where General Braxton Bragg was being challenged in Middle Tennessee by the Army of the Cumberland under Union Major General William S. Rosecrans, Longstreet&#x27;s roommate at West Point. By this time, Longstreet could be identified as part of a &quot;western concentration bloc&quot; which believed that reinforcing Confederate armies operating in the Western Theater to protect the states in that part of the Confederacy from invasion was more important than offensive campaigns in the Eastern Theater. This group also included Johnston and Louis Wigfall, now a Confederate senator, both of whom Longstreet was very close with. These people were generally cautious and believed that the Confederacy, with its limited resources, should engage in a defensive rather than an offensive war. Lee did detach two divisions from the First Corps but ordered them to Richmond, not Tennessee. The Confederate Army was suffering from an acute food shortage. Southern Virginia was said to have large quantities of cattle and substantial stores of bacon and corn. Meanwhile, seaborne movements of the Union IX Corps were thought to be aimed at launching an invasion of the Confederate coast anywhere from South Carolina to Southern Virginia. In response, Lee ordered Pickett&#x27;s division to the capital in mid-February. Hood&#x27;s division followed, and then Longstreet himself was told to take command of the detached divisions and the Departments of North Carolina and Southern Virginia. The divisions of McLaws and Anderson remained with Lee.

In March, Longstreet&#x27;s men primarily conducted foraging expeditions in Virginia and North Carolina. Longstreet sent Brigadier General Richard B. Garnett&#x27;s brigade to D.H. Hill to participate in Hill&#x27;s attempt to capture New Bern, a town on the North Carolina coast which had fallen to the Union in March 1862. The campaign was unsuccessful but netted a considerable amount of supplies. In April, Longstreet besieged Union forces in the city of Suffolk, Virginia. Fighting was light and nothing came of the siege. At the end of April, Longstreet was ordered by Secretary of War James Seddon to join Lee&#x27;s army as it faced attack from the Army of the Potomac, now commanded by Hooker, at the Battle of Chancellorsville. He moved his divisions north but could not reach the battle in time. Longstreet&#x27;s foraging operations yielded enough food to feed Lee&#x27;s entire army for two months. However, no further military objective was reached, and the operation caused Longstreet and 15,000 men of the First Corps to be absent from Chancellorsville. Eventually, Longstreet came under criticism from political enemies claiming that he could have marched his men back from Suffolk in time to join Lee. However, Sorrel says that it was &quot;humanly impossible&quot; for the men to move any faster.

===Gettysburg===

====Campaign plans====

Following Chancellorsville and the death of Stonewall Jackson, Longstreet and Lee met in mid-May to discuss the army&#x27;s summer campaign. Longstreet once more pushed for the detachment of all or part of his corps to be sent to Tennessee. The justification for this course of action was becoming more urgent as Union Major General Ulysses S. Grant was advancing on the critical Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River, Vicksburg. Longstreet argued that a reinforced army under Bragg could defeat Rosecrans and drive toward the Ohio River, which would compel Grant to break his hold on Vicksburg. He advanced these views during a meeting with Seddon, who approved of the idea but doubted that Lee would, and opined that Davis would be unlikely to go against Lee&#x27;s wishes. Longstreet had criticized Bragg&#x27;s generalship and may have been hoping to replace him, although he also might have wished to see Joseph Johnston take command, and indicated that he would be content to serve under him as a corps commander. Lee prevented this by telling Davis that parting with large numbers of troops would force him to move his army closer to Richmond, and instead advanced a plan to invade Pennsylvania. A campaign in the North would relieve agricultural and military pressure that the war was placing on Virginia and North Carolina, and, by threatening a federal city, disrupt Union offensives elsewhere and erode support for the war among Northern civilians. In his memoirs, Longstreet described his reaction to Lee&#x27;s proposal:

There is conflicting evidence for the veracity of Longstreet&#x27;s account. It was written years after the campaign and is affected by hindsight, both of the results of the battle and of heavy postbellum criticism. In letters of the time, Longstreet made no reference to such a bargain. In April 1868, Lee said that he &quot;had never made any such promise, and had never thought of doing any such thing&quot;. Yet in his post-battle report, Lee wrote, &quot;It had not been intended to fight a general battle at such a distance from our base, unless attacked by the enemy.&quot;

The Army of Northern Virginia was reorganized after Jackson&#x27;s death. Two division commanders, Richard S. Ewell and A.P. Hill, were promoted to lieutenant general and assumed command of the Second and the newly created Third Corps respectively. Longstreet&#x27;s First Corps gave up R.H. Anderson&#x27;s division during the reorganization, leaving Longstreet with the divisions of Hood, McLaws, and Pickett.

After determining that an advance north was inevitable, Longstreet dispatched the scout Henry Thomas Harrison, whom he had met during the Suffolk Campaign, to gather information. He paid Harrison in gold and told him that he &quot;did not care to see him till he could bring information of importance&quot;. Ewell&#x27;s corps led the army north, followed by Longstreet&#x27;s and Hill&#x27;s. The First Corps crossed the Potomac River from June 25 to 26. Harrison reported to Longstreet on the evening of June 28 and was instrumental in warning the Confederates that the Army of the Potomac was advancing north to meet them more quickly than they had anticipated, and was already gathered around Frederick, Maryland. Lee was initially skeptical, but the report prompted him to order the immediate concentration of his army north of Frederick near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Harrison also brought news that Hooker had been replaced as commander of the Army of the Potomac by Meade.

====July 1–2====
Longstreet&#x27;s actions at the Battle of Gettysburg would become the centerpiece of lasting controversy. Longstreet arrived on the battlefield at about 4:30p.m on the first day, July 1, 1863, hours ahead of his troops. Lee had not intended to fight before his army was fully concentrated, but chance and decisions by A.P. Hill, whose troops were the first to be engaged, brought on the confrontation. The battle on the first day was a strong Confederate victory. Two Union corps had been driven by Ewell and Hill from their positions north of Gettysburg back through the town into defensive positions on the heights to the south. Meeting with Lee, Longstreet was concerned about the strength of the Union defensive position on elevated ground and advocated a strategic movement around their left flank, to &quot;secure good ground between him and his capital&quot;, which would presumably compel Meade to attack defensive positions erected by the Confederates. Instead, Lee exclaimed, &quot;If the enemy is there tomorrow, I will attack him.&quot; Longstreet replied, &quot;If he is there tomorrow it is because he wants you to attack.&quot; Lee, energized by the success of his army that day, again refused. Longstreet suggested an immediate assault on the federal positions, but Lee insisted on waiting for Hood and McLaws, who were marching towards Gettysburg on the Chambersburg Pike. Longstreet sent a courier down the Cashtown Road to hurry them along. They eventually bivouacked about four miles (6.4 km) behind the lines. Pickett was performing rearguard duty in Cashtown and would not be ready to move until morning. A major blunder occurred when Ewell failed to seize the heights on Cemetery Hill after being ordered to do so &quot;if practicable&quot; by Lee.

Lee&#x27;s plan for July 2 called for Longstreet to attack the Union&#x27;s left flank, to be followed by Hill&#x27;s attack on Cemetery Ridge near the center, while Ewell demonstrated on the Union right. Longstreet again argued for a flanking maneuver around the Union left, but Lee rejected his plan. Longstreet was not ready to attack as early as Lee envisioned. He received permission from Lee to wait for Law&#x27;s brigade of Hood&#x27;s division to reach the field before advancing. Law marched his men quickly, covering in eleven hours, but did not arrive until noon. Three of Longstreet&#x27;s brigades were still in march column some distance from their designated positions. Longstreet&#x27;s soldiers were forced to take a long detour while approaching the enemy position, misled by inadequate reconnaissance that failed to identify a completely concealed route.

Postbellum criticism of Longstreet claims that he was ordered by Lee to attack in the early morning and that his delays were a significant contributor to the loss of the battle. Early and William N. Pendleton testified that Lee had ordered Longstreet to attack at sunrise and that Longstreet disobeyed. This claim was factually untrue and denied by Lee&#x27;s staff officers Walter H. Taylor and Charles Marshall. Lee agreed to the delays for arriving troops and did not issue his formal order for the attack until 11 A.M. Longstreet did not aggressively pursue Lee&#x27;s orders to launch an attack. Sorrel writes that Longstreet, unenthusiastic about the attack, displayed lethargy in bringing his troops forward. While Lee expected an attack around noon, Longstreet was not ready until 4 P.M. Meade used the time to bring more of his troops forward. Campaign historian Edwin Coddington presents the approach to the federal positions as &quot;a comedy of errors such as one might expect of inexperienced commanders and raw militia, but not of Lee&#x27;s &#x27;War Horse&#x27; and his veteran troops&quot;.

Hood opposed an attack on the Union left, arguing that the Union position was too strong, and proposed that his troops be moved to the right near Big Round Top and hit the Union in the rear. Longstreet insisted that Lee had rejected this plan and ordered him to make the assault against the front of the enemy lines. Once the assault began at around 4 pm, Longstreet pressed McLaws and Hood strongly against heavy Union resistance. Longstreet personally led the attack on horseback. Union Major General Daniel Sickles, commanding the III Corps, had, contrary to Meade&#x27;s orders, marched his men to the Peach Orchard, an exposed position well in front of the main Union lines. R.H. Anderson&#x27;s division of Hill&#x27;s corps, alongside McLaws&#x27; division and part of the division of Hood, launched a ferocious assault against Sickles with heavy artillery support which, after extremely intense fighting, pushed his corps back to the main Union lines. The Confederates were eventually repulsed after encountering fierce resistance from Union reinforcements. General Hood was wounded and replaced in command of his division by Law. Brigade commanders Barksdale and Paul Jones Semmes, both under McLaws, were mortally wounded. Law&#x27;s brigade attempted to carry Little Round Top, a hill on the far left of the Union lines. The hill had originally been without troops before Union Brigadier General Gouverneur K. Warren, Chief of Engineers, taking advantage of the Confederate delay, sent soldiers from the V Corps to fortify it. Confederate troops took the part of the hill known as Devil&#x27;s Den, but were unable to drive off Union forces at the top of the hill. The attacks had failed, and Longstreet&#x27;s corps suffered more than 4,000 casualties. Contributing to Longstreet&#x27;s failure was the fact that his attacks did not occur simultaneously with those of A.P. Hill and Ewell. Large portions of Hill&#x27;s and Ewell&#x27;s corps, including soldiers who had seen significant action the day before, were unengaged, and Meade was able to shift Thomas H. Ruger&#x27;s division from Ewell&#x27;s front to oppose Longstreet.

====July 3====

On the night of July 2, Longstreet did not follow his usual custom of meeting Lee at his headquarters to discuss the day&#x27;s battle, claiming that he was too fatigued. Instead, he spent part of the night planning for a movement around Big Round Top that would allow him to attack the enemy&#x27;s flank and rear. Longstreet, despite his use of scouting parties, was apparently unaware that a considerable body of troops from the Union VI Corps under John Sedgwick was in position to block this move. Shortly after issuing orders for the attack, around sunrise, Longstreet was joined at his headquarters by Lee, who was dismayed at this turn of events. The commanding general had intended for Longstreet to attack the Union left early in the morning in a manner similar to the attack of July 2, using Pickett&#x27;s newly arrived division, in concert with a resumed attack by Ewell on Culp&#x27;s Hill. What Lee found was that no one had ordered Pickett&#x27;s division forward from its bivouac in the rear and that Longstreet had been planning an independent operation without consulting with him. Lee wrote in his after-battle report that Longstreet&#x27;s &quot;dispositions were not completed as early as was expected&quot;.
Since his plans for an early morning coordinated attack were now infeasible, Lee instead ordered Longstreet to coordinate a massive assault on the center of the Union line at Cemetery Ridge with his corps. The Union position was held by the II Corps under Winfield Scott Hancock. Longstreet strongly felt that this assault had little chance of success, and shared his concerns with Lee. The Confederates would have to march over close to one mile (1.6 km) of open ground and negotiate sturdy fences under fire. Longstreet urged Lee not to use his entire corps in the attack, arguing that the divisions of Law and McLaws were tired from the previous day and that shifting them towards Cemetery Ridge would dangerously expose the Confederate right flank. Lee conceded and instead decided to use men from A.P. Hill&#x27;s corps to accompany Pickett. The force would include about 14,000 or 15,000 men. Longstreet again told Lee that he believed the attack would fail.

Lee did not change his mind, and Longstreet relented. The final plan called for an artillery barrage by 170 cannon under Alexander. Then, the three brigades under Pickett and the four brigades in the division of Henry Heth, temporarily commanded by Brigadier General J. Johnston Pettigrew, positioned to Pickett&#x27;s left, would lead the attack. Two brigades from William Dorsey Pender&#x27;s division, temporarily commanded by Brigadier General Isaac R. Trimble, would fill in as support behind Pettigrew. Two brigades from R.H. Anderson&#x27;s division were to support Pickett&#x27;s right flank. Despite his vocal disapproval of the plan and although most of the units came from A.P. Hill&#x27;s corps, Lee designated Longstreet to lead the attack. Longstreet dutifully saw to the positioning of Pickett&#x27;s men. General Pickett placed the brigades of Garnett and Brigadier General James L. Kemper in front with Armistead behind them in support. However, Longstreet neglected to adequately check on Pettigrew&#x27;s division. Pettigrew had never commanded a division before, and the division which he had just been appointed to lead had suffered one-third casualties in the fighting on July 1. His men were positioned behind Pickett&#x27;s lines, leaving Pickett vulnerable, and the troops on his far left were dangerously exposed. Longstreet and Hill still had a tense relationship, which may have played a role in Longstreet not carefully overseeing Hill&#x27;s troops. Hill was with Lee and Longstreet throughout much of the morning, but wrote after the battle that he had ordered his men to report to Longstreet, implying that he felt he was not responsible for arranging them.

During preparations for the attack, Longstreet began to agonize over the assault. He attempted to pass the responsibility for launching Pickett&#x27;s division to Alexander. The artillery bombardment began at about 1 P.M. Union batteries responded, and the two sides fired back and forth for about one hour and forty minutes. When the time came to actually order Pickett forward, Longstreet could only nod in assent, unable to verbalize the order, thus beginning the assault known as Pickett&#x27;s Charge. Beginning at about 3 P.M., Confederate troops marched towards the Union positions. As Longstreet had anticipated, the attack was a complete disaster. The assaulting units suffered massive casualties. Pettigrew and Trimble were wounded. Pickett&#x27;s first two brigades were severely mauled. Kemper was wounded and Garnett was killed. Armistead&#x27;s brigade briefly breached the stone wall that marked Hancock&#x27;s lines, where Armistead fell mortally wounded, but the brigade was repulsed. To his men, Lee said, &quot;It is all my fault.&quot; According to two of Longstreet&#x27;s staff officers, Lee subsequently expressed regret for not taking Longstreet&#x27;s advice. On July 4, the Confederate army began its retreat from Gettysburg. Hampered by rain, the bulk of the army finally made it across the Potomac River on the night of July 13–14.

===Chickamauga===
In mid-August 1863, Longstreet resumed his attempts to be transferred to the Western Theater. He wrote a private letter to Seddon, requesting that he be transferred to serve under his old friend Joseph Johnston. He followed this up in conversations with his congressional ally Wigfall, who had long considered Longstreet a suitable replacement for Braxton Bragg. Bragg had a poor combat record and was very unpopular with his men and officers. Lee and President Davis agreed to the request on September 5. McLaws, Hood, a brigade from Pickett&#x27;s division, and Alexander&#x27;s 26-gun artillery battalion, traveled over 16 railroads on a route through the Carolinas to reach Bragg in northern Georgia. On September 8, with reinforcements on the way, Bragg gave up the fortified city and critical rail juncture of Chattanooga, Tennessee, to Rosecrans without a fight and retreated into Georgia. The troop transfer took over three weeks. Lead elements of the corps arrived on September 17.

On September 19 at the Battle of Chickamauga, Bragg began an unsuccessful attempt to interpose his army between Rosecrans and Chattanooga before the arrival of most of Longstreet&#x27;s corps. Throughout the day, Confederate troops launched largely ineffectual assaults on Union positions that were highly costly for both sides. One of Longstreet&#x27;s own divisions under Hood successfully resisted a strong Union counterattack from Jefferson C. Davis&#x27;s division of the XX Corps that afternoon. When Longstreet himself arrived on the field in the late evening, he failed to find Bragg&#x27;s headquarters. He and his staff spent considerable time riding looking for them. They accidentally came across a federal picket line and were nearly captured.

When the two finally met at Bragg&#x27;s headquarters late at night, Bragg placed Longstreet in command of the left wing of his army; Lieutenant General Leonidas Polk commanded the right. Longstreet&#x27;s command consisted of Simon Bolivar Buckner&#x27;s corps, under which were the divisions of Alexander P. Stewart and William Preston, Bushrod Johnson&#x27;s division, Thomas C. Hindman&#x27;s division, and Hood&#x27;s division. McLaws&#x27; division fell under Longstreet&#x27;s command but did not completely arrive from Virginia until September 21, after the Battle of Chickamauga had ended. Joseph B. Kershaw was placed in command of his two brigades which were on the field. Bragg made a plan for an attack at 8a.m. on September 20. Longstreet lined up most of his men into two lines, but he placed Hood&#x27;s division behind Johnson in a column, intended as shock troops. The attack was supposed to begin early in the morning shortly after an assault by Polk&#x27;s wing. However, confusion and mishandled orders caused Polk&#x27;s attack to be delayed, and Longstreet&#x27;s advance did not begin until just after 11 after hearing gunfire from his left. A mistaken order from General Rosecrans caused a gap to appear in the Union line by transferring Thomas J. Wood&#x27;s division from the right to reinforce the XIV Corps under George Henry Thomas in the center.

Longstreet took advantage of the confusion. The organization of the attack was well suited to the terrain and would have penetrated the Union line regardless. Johnson&#x27;s division poured through the gap, driving the Union forces back. After Longstreet ordered Hindman&#x27;s division forward, the Union right collapsed. Rosecrans fled as units began to retreat in panic. Thomas managed to rally the retreating units and solidify a defensive position on Snodgrass Hill. He held that position against repeated afternoon attacks by Longstreet, who was not adequately supported by the Confederate right wing. Sorrel told Stewart to move his division forward to attack the Union rearguard. Stewart initially declined, demanding confirmation from Longstreet. Longstreet was incensed at his refusal and ordered him to go forward. Stewart did so and captured about 400 prisoners, but Thomas had already managed to extricate the units under his control to Chattanooga. Bragg&#x27;s failure to coordinate the right wing and cavalry to further envelop Thomas prevented a total rout of the Union Army. Bragg also refused to pursue the retreating Federals aggressively, resulting in the futile Siege of Chattanooga. He had dismissed a proposal from Longstreet that he do so, citing a lack of transportation and calling the plan a &quot;visionary scheme&quot;. Nevertheless, Chickamauga was the greatest Confederate victory in the Western Theater and Longstreet received significant credit.

===Tennessee===

Not long after the Confederates entered Tennessee following their victory at Chickamauga, Longstreet clashed with Bragg and became a leader of the group of senior commanders who conspired to have him removed. Bragg&#x27;s subordinates had long been dissatisfied with his abrasive personality and poor battlefield record; the arrival of Longstreet (the senior lieutenant general in the Army) and his officers, and the fact that they quickly took their side, added credibility to the earlier claims. Longstreet wrote to Seddon, &quot;I am convinced that nothing but the hand of God can save us or help us as long as we have our present commander.&quot; The situation became so grave that Davis was forced to intercede in person. What followed was a scene in which Bragg sat red-faced as a procession of his subordinates condemned him. Longstreet stated that Bragg &quot;was incompetent to manage an army or put men into a fight&quot; and that he &quot;knew nothing of the business&quot;. On October 12, Davis declared his support for Bragg. He left him and his dissatisfied subordinates in their positions.
Bragg relieved or reassigned the generals who had testified against him and retaliated against Longstreet by reducing his command to only those units that he brought with him from Virginia. Bragg resigned himself to the siege in Chattanooga. At about this time, Longstreet learned of the birth of a son, who was named Robert Lee. Grant arrived in Chattanooga on October 23 and took overall command of the new Union Military Division of the Mississippi. He replaced Rosecrans with Thomas.

While Longstreet&#x27;s relationship with Bragg was extremely poor, his connections with his subordinates also deteriorated. He had a strong antebellum friendship with McLaws, but it began to show signs of souring after McLaws criticized Longstreet&#x27;s conduct at Gettysburg and was accused by Longstreet of displaying lethargy after Chickamauga. Hood&#x27;s old division was under the temporary command of Brigadier General Micah Jenkins. The brigadier general who had been in the division the longest was Evander Law, who had temporarily commanded the division more than once in the past. However, Jenkins outranked Law. Jenkins and Law disliked each other, and both desired permanent command of the division. Longstreet favored Jenkins, his longtime protégé, while most of the men favored Law. Longstreet had asked Davis to name a permanent commander, but he refused.

On October 27, Union troops managed to open up a &quot;cracker line&quot; to access food by defeating Law&#x27;s brigade under Jenkins at the Battle of Brown&#x27;s Ferry. In the nighttime Battle of Wauhatchie from October 28–29, Jenkins failed to regain the lost position, for which he blamed Law and Brigadier General Jerome B. Robertson. Longstreet took no immediate action against Law but complained about Robertson. A court of inquiry was set up, but its proceedings were suspended and Robertson returned to command.

After the Confederate failures, Longstreet devised a strategy to prevent reinforcement and lifting of the siege by Grant. He knew this Union reaction was underway, and that the nearest railhead was Bridgeport, Alabama, where portions of two Union corps would soon arrive. After sending his artillery commander, Porter Alexander, to reconnoiter the Union-occupied town, he devised a plan to shift most of the Army of Tennessee away from the siege, setting up logistical support in Rome, Georgia, to go after Bridgeport to take the railhead, possibly catching Hooker, who was leading a detachment of arriving Union troops from the Eastern Theater, in a disadvantageous position. The plan was well received and approved by President Davis, but it was disapproved by Bragg, who objected to the significant logistical challenges it posed. Longstreet accepted Bragg&#x27;s arguments and agreed to a plan in which he and his men were dispatched to East Tennessee to deal with an advance by the Union Army of the Ohio, commanded by Burnside. Longstreet was selected both due to enmity on Bragg&#x27;s part and because the War Department intended for Longstreet&#x27;s men to return to Lee&#x27;s army and this movement was in that direction. Thus began the Knoxville campaign.

Longstreet was criticized for the slow pace of his advance toward Knoxville in November, and some of his soldiers began using the nickname &quot;Peter the Slow&quot; to describe him. At the Battle of Campbell&#x27;s Station on November 16, the Federals evaded Longstreet&#x27;s troops. This was due both to the poor performance of Law, who exposed his brigade to the enemy and thus ruined what was supposed to be a surprise attack, and Burnside&#x27;s skillful retreat. The Confederates also dealt with muddy roads and a shortage of good supplies.

Burnside settled into entrenchments around the city, which Longstreet besieged. Longstreet learned that Bragg had been defeated at Chattanooga on November 25 and that Major General William Tecumseh Sherman&#x27;s men were marching to relieve Burnside. He decided to risk a frontal attack on Union entrenchments before they arrived. On November 29, he sent his troops forward at the Battle of Fort Sanders. The attack was repulsed, and Longstreet was forced to retreat. When Grant defeated Bragg, Longstreet was ordered to join forces with the Army of Tennessee in northern Georgia. He demurred and began to move back to Virginia, soon pursued by Sherman. Longstreet defeated federal troops in an engagement at Bean&#x27;s Station on December 14. The greatest effect of the campaign was to deprive Bragg of troops he sorely needed in Chattanooga. Longstreet&#x27;s second independent command (after Suffolk) was a failure and his self-confidence was damaged. He reacted to the failure of the campaign by blaming others. He relieved Lafayette McLaws from command and requested the court-martial of Robertson and Law. He also submitted a letter of resignation to Adjutant General Samuel Cooper on December 30, 1863, but his request to be relieved was denied. Bragg was relieved from command and replaced by Joseph Johnston on December 27.

Longstreet established winter quarters in Russellville and Morristown. He attempted to keep communications open with Lee&#x27;s army in Virginia, but Federal cavalry Brigadier General William W. Averell&#x27;s raids destroyed the railroads, isolating him and forcing him to rely only on Eastern Tennessee for supplies. Longstreet&#x27;s corps suffered through a severe winter in Eastern Tennessee with inadequate shelter and provisions. More than half of the men were without shoes. Writing to Georgia&#x27;s Quartermaster General Ira Roe Foster on January 24, 1864, Longstreet noted: &quot;There are five Georgia Brigades in this Army ... all alike in excessive need of shoes, clothing of all kinds, and blankets. All that you can send will be thankfully received.&quot;

In February 1864, the lines of communication were repaired. Once the weather warmed, Longstreet&#x27;s men marched north to the Army of Northern Virginia at Gordonsville.

===Wilderness to Appomattox===

In March, Longstreet rejoined the Army of Northern Virginia. Presented by Lee with a plan for a joint offensive by Johnston and Longstreet into Kentucky, Longstreet made the scheme bolder by adding 20,000 men under General Beauregard, who was headquartered in South Carolina. However, the plan met with disapproval from President Davis and his newly appointed military advisor, Braxton Bragg, and Longstreet remained in Virginia.

Longstreet discovered that his old friend Grant had been appointed General-in-Chief of the Union Army, with headquarters in the field alongside the Army of the Potomac. Longstreet told his fellow officers that &quot;he will fight us every day and every hour until the end of the war.&quot; Longstreet helped save the Confederate Army from defeat in his first battle back with Lee&#x27;s army, the Battle of the Wilderness in May 1864. After Grant moved south of the Rapidan River in an attempt to take Richmond, Lee intended to delay battle to give Longstreet&#x27;s 14,000 men time to arrive. Grant disrupted these plans by attacking him on May 5, and the fighting was inconclusive. The following morning at 5 am, Hancock led two divisions in a ferocious attack on A.P. Hill&#x27;s corps, driving the men back two miles (3.2 km). As this was happening, Longstreet&#x27;s men arrived. They took advantage of an old roadbed built for an out-of-use railroad to creep through a densely wooded area unnoticed before launching a powerful flanking attack.

Longstreet&#x27;s men moved forward along the Orange Plank Road against the II Corps and in two hours nearly drove it from the field. He developed tactics to deal with difficult terrain, ordering the advance of six brigades by heavy skirmish lines, which allowed his men to deliver a continuous fire into the enemy while proving to be elusive targets themselves. Historian Edward Steere attributed much of the success of the Army to &quot;the display of tactical genius by Longstreet which more than redressed his disparity in numerical strength&quot;. After the war, Hancock said to Longstreet of this flanking maneuver: &quot;You rolled me up like a wet blanket.&quot;

During the assault, Longstreet was wounded by friendly fire only away from where Stonewall Jackson was accidentally wounded almost exactly a year earlier during the Chancellorsville campaign. A bullet passed through his shoulder, severing nerves, and tearing a gash in his throat. Jenkins, who was riding with Longstreet, was also shot and died from his wounds. The momentum of the attack subsided. As he was taken from the field, Longstreet urged Lee to press the attack. Instead, Lee delayed further movement until units could be realigned, giving the Union defenders adequate time to reorganize. The subsequent attack was a failure. According to Alexander: &quot;I have always believed that, but for Longstreet&#x27;s fall, the panic which was fairly underway in Hancock&#x27;s [II] Corps would have been extended &amp; have resulted in Grant&#x27;s being forced to retreat back across the Rapidan.&quot;

Longstreet was succeeded in command of his corps by R.H. Anderson. He missed the rest of the 1864 spring and summer campaign, where Lee sorely missed his skill in handling the army. Without him, the Confederate army fought Grant at Spotsylvania Court House and was besieged by Union forces at Petersburg. On May 1, he was confirmed as an Episcopalian. He was treated in Lynchburg, Virginia, and recuperated in Augusta, Georgia, with his cousin, Emma Eve Longstreet Sibley, the daughter of his father&#x27;s brother Gilbert. While in Augusta, he participated in the funeral service for Polk at Saint Paul&#x27;s Church, casting earth onto the coffin. He rejoined Lee in October 1864, with his right arm paralyzed and in a sling, initially unable to ride a horse. He had taught himself to write with his left hand; by periodically pulling on his arm, as advised by doctors, he regained the use of his right hand in later years. At this time, Longstreet&#x27;s staff underwent major changes, most significantly the transfer of Sorrel, Longstreet&#x27;s Chief of Staff, to brigade command. He was replaced by Major Osmun Latrobe. For the remainder of the Siege of Petersburg, Longstreet commanded the defenses in front of the capital of Richmond, including all forces north of the James River and Pickett&#x27;s Division at Bermuda Hundred. He retreated with Lee in the Appomattox campaign, commanding both the First and Third Corps, following the death of A.P. Hill on April 2.

As Lee&#x27;s army attempted to escape to Farmville, Longstreet was engaged at Sailor&#x27;s Creek on April 6. The Confederates were unable to reach the town, but with the assistance of troops under Anderson and Ewell, managed to prevent federal troops from blocking the army&#x27;s last path of escape. The overall battle ended in disaster, with nearly 7,000 of the 10,000 Confederate troops engaged killed, wounded, or captured. By April 7, Lee&#x27;s army had been reduced from nearly 40,000 men on March 31 to 25,000. A group of Confederate officers including William Pendleton, the Chief of Artillery, concluded that the time had come to ask Lee to open negotiations for the army&#x27;s surrender. Pendleton approached Longstreet and asked him to intercede with Lee, but he refused, saying, &quot;If General Lee doesn&#x27;t know when to surrender until I tell him, he will never know.&quot; Pendleton approached Lee, who was in communication with Grant on the subject of surrender. Lee refused to surrender the army. Lee held his last conference of war on the night of April 8. It was decided that at daybreak, Longstreet would hold the Union troops back while John B. Gordon would lead an escape towards Lynchburg, and then cover his retreat. At the Battle of Appomattox Court House that morning, Longstreet was heavily engaged with the Union II Corps under Andrew A. Humphreys. Gordon&#x27;s troops were surrounded, and he requested reinforcements which Longstreet could not furnish. Lee was left with no alternative but to meet Grant to discuss surrender.

Lee worried that his refusal to meet with Grant to discuss surrender terms at the latter&#x27;s first request would cause him to demand harsher terms. Longstreet advised him of his belief that Grant would treat them fairly. As Lee rode toward Appomattox Court House on April 9, Longstreet said that if Grant gave too strong demands, he ought to &quot;break off the interview and tell General Grant to do his worst&quot;. After Lee&#x27;s surrender, Longstreet arrived in the McLean House, where Grant happily greeted him. He offered Longstreet a cigar and invited him to play cards. &quot;Why do men fight who were born to be brothers?...His whole greeting and conduct towards us was as though nothing had ever happened to mar our pleasant relations&quot;, Longstreet told a reporter.

==Reconstruction era==
On June 7, 1865, Lee, Longstreet, and other former Confederate officers were indicted by a grand jury in Norfolk, Virginia for the high crime of treason against the United States, a capital offense. Grant objected and went to the White House, telling President Andrew Johnson that the men were on parole and protected by the surrender terms at Appomattox. When Grant threatened to resign, Johnson backed down, and on June 20, Attorney General James Speed ordered the United States Attorney in Norfolk to drop treason proceedings.

Longstreet and his family settled in New Orleans, popular among former Confederate generals. He entered into a cotton-brokerage partnership and became president of the Southern and Western Life and Accident Insurance Company. He sought the presidency of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad but was unsuccessful, and also failed in an attempt to get investors for a proposed railroad from New Orleans to Monterrey, Mexico. With Grant&#x27;s support, he applied for a pardon from Johnson. Johnson refused, telling Longstreet: &quot;There are three persons of the South who can never receive amnesty: Mr. Davis, General Lee, and yourself. You have given the Union cause too much trouble.&quot;

Longstreet called for Southern acceptance of Reconstruction and acquiescence to federal laws, including those abolishing slavery and granting citizenship to blacks. He encouraged Southern whites to join the heavily Northern Republican Party, arguing that if they did not, the Southern wing of the party would be exclusively dominated by blacks, whereas white men joining the party would allow the black vote to be controlled. In June 1868, the Radical Republican-controlled United States Congress enacted a law that granted pardons and restored political rights to numerous former Confederate officers, including Longstreet. Longstreet joined the Republicans, or, as Southerners sometimes called them, &quot;Black Republicans&quot;. He endorsed Grant for president in the 1868 election, attended his inauguration in Washington, D.C., and six days later was appointed by Grant as surveyor of customs in New Orleans. The post carried an annual salary of $6,000, and Longstreet was confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 25–10. For these acts, he lost favor with many white Southerners, who regarded him as a traitor for supporting the people they viewed as oppressive occupiers. His old friend D.H. Hill wrote to a newspaper: &quot;Our scalawag is the local leper of the community.&quot; In contrast to Northerners who moved South and were sometimes referred to as &quot;Carpetbaggers&quot;, Hill wrote, Longstreet &quot;is a native, which is so much the worse&quot;. Longstreet did not retreat in face of the criticism. He actively supported Henry C. Warmoth, the Republican Governor of Louisiana and a former Union officer. In May 1870, Warmoth named him adjutant general of the Louisiana State Militia. About one month later, he was named president of the newly organized New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad. On January 8, 1872, Longstreet was commissioned a major general in the state militia and assigned to the command of all militia and police forces in New Orleans. Shortly after, he resigned his posts as a collector of customs and as railroad president, followed in April by his position as adjutant general in the militia.

Authors espousing the Lost Cause, a movement that glorified the Southern cause and denounced Reconstruction, attacked Longstreet&#x27;s war career for years after his death. Modern authors trace that criticism to Longstreet&#x27;s acceptance of the defeat and accommodations both with the Republican party and freed blacks. The attacks formally began on January 19, 1872, the anniversary of Lee&#x27;s birth and less than two years after Lee died. Jubal Early, in a speech at Washington College, exonerated Lee for the defeat at Gettysburg. He accused Longstreet of attacking late on the second day and held him accountable for the debacle on the third. The following year, William Pendleton claimed in the same venue that Longstreet disobeyed an explicit order to attack at sunrise on July 2. The so-called sunrise order was a fabrication.
In April 1873, Longstreet dispatched a police force under Colonel Theodore W. DeKlyne to Colfax, Louisiana, to help the local government and its majority-black supporters defend themselves against an insurrection by white supremacists. DeKlyne did not arrive until April 14, one day after the Colfax massacre. His men&#x27;s task consisted mainly of burying blacks who had been killed and attempting to arrest the culprits. During protests of election irregularities in 1874, referred to as the Battle of Liberty Place, an armed force of 8,400 members of the anti-Reconstructionist White League advanced on the State House in New Orleans, which was the capitol of Louisiana at the time, after Republican William Pitt Kellogg was declared the winner of a close and heavily disputed gubernatorial election. Longstreet commanded a force of 3,600 Metropolitan Police, city policemen, and African-American militia troops, armed with two Gatling guns and a battery of artillery. He rode to meet the protesters but was pulled from his horse, shot by a spent ball, and taken prisoner. The White League charged, causing many of Longstreet&#x27;s men to flee or surrender. Total casualties amounted to 38 killed and 79 wounded. Federal troops sent by President Grant were required to restore order. Longstreet&#x27;s use of armed black troops during the disturbances increased the denunciations by anti-Reconstructionists.

In 1875, Longstreet began to challenge the criticisms of his war record, demanding evidence from Pendleton and Lee&#x27;s staff officers. By then, these charges, alongside anger at him for his use of black troops in Louisiana, had destroyed his reputation. Longstreet published a series of articles defending his war record. At the same time, he became popular with Northerners, who thought highly of his support for Reconstruction and praise for Grant. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s, Longstreet often gave speeches in the North, many of them in the presence of Union veterans, and was received favorably. A large ceremony took place in Atlanta in 1886 to mark the 25th anniversary of the attack on Fort Sumter. Longstreet was not invited, but he went anyway. He was embraced by Jefferson Davis, and a crowd cheered.

In 1875 the Longstreet family left New Orleans with concerns over health and safety, returning to Gainesville, Georgia. By this time Louise had given birth to ten children, five of whom lived to adulthood. Longstreet continued to serve on the city school board and as an administrator of the University of Louisiana, later Tulane University. In March 1877, on one of his frequent trips to New Orleans on business, Longstreet converted to Catholicism and remained a devout believer until his death. Fr. Abram J. Ryan, author of &quot;The Conquered Banner&quot;, encouraged Longstreet to convert, assuring him he would be welcomed with open arms if he came into the Church.

==Later life==

Longstreet applied for various jobs through the Rutherford B. Hayes administration of 1877–1881 and was briefly considered for Secretary of the Navy. He served briefly as deputy collector of internal revenue and as postmaster of Gainesville. Longstreet&#x27;s chief ambition was to be U.S. Marshal of Georgia. President Hayes appointed Longstreet as his Minister Resident to the Ottoman Empire, a position he held from December 14, 1880, to April 29, 1881. Longstreet suffered from the high cost of living in Constantinople. It prevented him from bringing his family, and the entertainment that he was expected to provide left him financially worse off than when he arrived. His only known accomplishment was convincing Sultan Abdul Hamid II to reverse his position forbidding American archeologists from undertaking research in Ottoman territories. He was granted a 60-day leave to tour Europe before being recalled in accordance with his own desires after the marshal position became available.

Longstreet served as a U.S. Marshal of Georgia from 1881 to 1884, but the return of a Democratic administration under Grover Cleveland in 1885 ended his political career and he went into semi-retirement on a farm near Gainesville, where he raised turkeys and planted orchards and vineyards on terraced ground that his neighbors referred to jokingly as &quot;Gettysburg&quot;. A devastating fire on April 9, 1889, destroyed his house and many of his possessions, including his personal papers and memorabilia. That December, Louise Longstreet died.

Longstreet rebutted criticism of his war record from other Confederates in his memoirs, &quot;From Manassas to Appomattox&quot;, a labor of five years published in 1896. Piston describes the prose as &quot;entertaining, if occasionally labored&quot;. In the book, Longstreet praises several Civil War officers but frequently disparages others, particularly his postwar detractors Jubal Early and Fitzhugh Lee. He expresses personal affection for Lee but is at times critical of his strategy. Piston argues that the quality of the book is diminished by bitterness and lack of objectivity. It did little to alter the views of Longstreet&#x27;s opponents.

Longstreet served from 1897 to 1904, under presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt, as U.S. Commissioner of Railroads, succeeding Wade Hampton III. In 1897, at the age of 76, in a ceremony at the governor&#x27;s mansion in Atlanta, Longstreet married 34-year-old librarian Helen Dortch. Although Longstreet&#x27;s children reacted poorly to the marriage, Helen became a devoted wife and an avid supporter of his legacy after his death. She outlived him by 58 years, dying in 1962. In 1898, Longstreet, then 77, volunteered to lead U.S. troops in Cuba during the Spanish–American War. Longstreet&#x27;s final years were marked by poor health and partial deafness. In 1902 he suffered from severe rheumatism and was unable to stand for more than a few minutes at a time. His weight diminished from 200 to 135 pounds by January 1903. Cancer developed in his right eye, and in December he had X-ray therapy in Chicago to treat it. He contracted pneumonia and died in Gainesville on January 2, 1904. Bishop Benjamin Joseph Keiley, who had served under Longstreet, said his funeral Mass. Longstreet is buried in Alta Vista Cemetery in Gainesville. He outlived most of his detractors and was one of only a few general officers from the Civil War to live into the 20th century.

==Legacy==
===Historical reputation===
Longstreet was subject to vigorous attacks over his war record beginning in the 1870s and continuing after his death. His widow published &quot;Lee and Longstreet at High Tide&quot; in his defense and stated that &quot;the South was seditiously taught to believe that the Federal Victory was wholly the fortuitous outcome of the culpable disobedience of General Longstreet&quot;.

In the first half of the 20th century, Freeman kept criticism of Longstreet foremost in Civil War scholarship in his biography of Lee. Speaking of Gettysburg on July 2, 1863, he writes: &quot;The battle was being decided at that very hour in the mind of Longstreet, who at his camp, a few miles away, was eating his heart away in sullen resentment that Lee had rejected his long cherished plan of a strategic offensive and a tactical defensive.&quot; He called Longstreet&#x27;s performance so sluggish that &quot;it has often been asked why Lee did not arrest him for insubordination or order him before a court-martial&quot;. Freeman moderated his views in his later &quot;Lee&#x27;s Lieutenants: a Study in Command&quot;, where he states that Longstreet&#x27;s &quot;attitude was wrong but his instinct was correct. He should have obeyed orders, but the order should not have been given.&quot; Clifford Dowdey, a Virginia newspaperman and novelist, was noted for his severe criticism of Longstreet in the 1950s and 1960s.

In 1974, Michael Shaara&#x27;s novel &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; about the Battle of Gettysburg was published, based in part on Longstreet&#x27;s memoirs. In 1993 the book was adapted into a film, &quot;Gettysburg&quot;. Longstreet is depicted very favorably in both, significantly improving his standing in popular imagination. Historians Thomas L. Connelly and Barbara L. Bellows&#x27; book &quot;God and General Longstreet&quot; (1982) also upgraded Longstreet &quot;through an attack on Lee, the Lost Cause, and the Virginia revisionists&quot;. In 1993, Wert published a new Longstreet biography, stating that his subject was &quot;the finest corps commander in the Army of Northern Virginia; in fact, he was arguably the best corps commander in the conflict on either side.&quot; Military historian Richard L. DiNardo wrote: &quot;Even Longstreet&#x27;s most virulent critics have conceded that he put together the best staff employed by any commander, and that his &quot;de facto&quot; chief of staff, Lieutenant Colonel G. Moxley Sorrel, was the best staff officer in the Confederacy.&quot; Noting Longstreet&#x27;s delegation of control of battlefield movements to his staff, DiNardo argues that this allowed him to communicate more effectively during battles. Praise for Longstreet&#x27;s political conduct is tempered by the fact that he urged white acceptance of Reconstruction at least in part so that whites, and not blacks, would have the preeminent role in rebuilding the South. Nevertheless, he has been commended for his willingness to work with the North, support for black voting rights, and bravery in leading a partially black militia to suppress a white supremacist insurrection.

===Memorials===
Longstreet is remembered in his hometown of Gainesville, Georgia, through the Longstreet Bridge, a portion of U.S. Route 129 that crosses the Chattahoochee River (later dammed to form Lake Sidney Lanier), and the Longstreet Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy.

In 1998, one of the last monuments erected at Gettysburg National Military Park was dedicated to Longstreet: an equestrian statue by sculptor Gary Casteel. The monument was funded through a grassroots campaign, and is one of the only Confederate monuments in the park &quot;not paid for by taxpayers in the states of the former Confederacy.&quot;

These two monuments are the only two memorials to Longstreet, whereas there were once more statues of Nathan Bedford Forrest in Tennessee than there were of U.S. President Andrew Jackson. At least one historian attributes this to Longstreet&#x27;s defense of the &quot;rights of the freedmen and women&quot; whereas Forrest was considered the &quot;avenging angel&quot; of American white supremacy and the Lost Cause myth.

Longstreet&#x27;s Billet, the house in Russellville, Tennessee, that was occupied by Longstreet in the winter of 1863–64, is now The Longstreet Museum.

==In popular culture==
Longstreet is a minor character in two novels by Ben Ames Williams, one of his descendants: &quot;House Divided&quot; (1947) and &quot;The Unconquered&quot; (1953). He appears as a cadet in &quot;Santa Fe Trail&quot; (1940), played by actor Frank Wilcox.

Longstreet plays a prominent role in Michael Shaara&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize–winning novel &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; and in the film &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, portrayed by Tom Berenger. He is also featured in Shaara&#x27;s son Jeff Shaara&#x27;s novel &quot;Gods and Generals&quot;, a prequel to his father&#x27;s novel focused on the Eastern Theater before Gettysburg. In the film &quot;Gods and Generals&quot; (2003), he is portrayed by Bruce Boxleitner in a minor role.

In Harry Turtledove&#x27;s alternate history series Southern Victory, Longstreet served as the fourth President of the Confederate States of America.

<text>A fortune cookie is a crisp and sugary cookie wafer made from flour, sugar, vanilla, and sesame seed oil with a piece of paper inside, a &quot;fortune&quot;, an aphorism, or a vague prophecy. The message inside may also include a Chinese phrase with translation and/or a list of lucky numbers used by some as lottery numbers. Fortune cookies are often served as a dessert in Chinese restaurants in the United States, Canada, Australia, and other countries, but they are not Chinese in origin. The exact origin of fortune cookies is unclear, though various immigrant groups in California claim to have popularized them in the early 20th century. They most likely originated from cookies made by Japanese immigrants to the United States in the late 19th or early 20th century. The Japanese version did not have the Chinese lucky numbers and were eaten with tea.

== Translations of the name ==

There is no single accepted Chinese name for the cookies, with a large variety of translations being used to describe them in the Chinese, all of which being more-or-less literal translations of the English &quot;fortune cookie&quot;. Examples include: 幸运籤饼 &quot;xìngyùn qiān bǐng&quot; &quot;good luck lot cookie&quot;, 籤语饼 &quot;qiān yǔ bǐng&quot; &quot;fortune words cookie&quot;, 幸运饼 &quot;xìngyùn bǐng&quot; &quot;good luck cookie&quot;, 幸运籤语饼 &quot;xìngyùn qiān yǔ bǐng&quot; &quot;lucky fortune words cookie&quot;, 幸运甜饼 &quot;xìngyùn tián bǐng&quot; &quot;good luck sweet cookie&quot;, 幸福饼干 &quot;xìngfú bǐnggān&quot; &quot;good luck biscuit&quot;, or 占卜饼 &quot;zhānbǔ bǐng&quot; &quot;divining cookie&quot;.

== History ==
As far back as the 19th century, a cookie very similar in appearance to the modern fortune cookie was made in Kyoto, Japan, and there is a Japanese temple tradition of random fortunes, called omikuji. The Japanese version of the cookie differs in several ways: they are a little bit larger; are made of darker dough; and their batter contains sesame and miso rather than vanilla and butter. They contain a fortune; however, the small slip of paper was wedged into the bend of the cookie rather than placed inside the hollow portion. This kind of cookie is called and is still sold in some regions of Japan, especially in Kanazawa, Ishikawa. It is also sold in the neighborhood of Fushimi Inari-taisha shrine in Kyoto.

Makoto Hagiwara of Golden Gate Park&#x27;s Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco is reported to have been the first person in the U.S. to have served the modern version of the cookie when he did so at the tea garden in the early 1900s. The fortune cookies were made by a San Francisco bakery, Benkyodo.

David Jung, founder of the Hong Kong Noodle Company in Los Angeles, made a competing claim that he invented the cookie in 1918. San Francisco&#x27;s Court of Historical Review attempted to settle the dispute in 1983. During the proceedings, a fortune cookie was introduced as a piece of evidence with a message reading, &quot;S.F. Judge who rules for L.A. Not Very Smart Cookie&quot;. A federal judge of the Court of Historical Review, from San Francisco themselves, determined that the cookie originated with Hagiwara and the court ruled in favor of San Francisco. Subsequently, the city of Los Angeles condemned the decision.

Seiichi Kito, the founder of Fugetsu-do of Little Tokyo in Los Angeles, also claims to have invented the cookie. Kito claims to have gotten the idea of putting a message in a cookie from Omikuji (fortune slip) which are sold at temples and shrines in Japan. According to his story, he sold his cookies to Chinese restaurants where they were greeted with much enthusiasm in both the Los Angeles and San Francisco areas, before spreading.

Up to around World War II, fortune cookies were known as &quot;fortune tea cakes&quot;—likely reflecting their origins in Japanese tea cakes.

Fortune cookies moved from being a confection dominated by Japanese-Americans to one dominated by Chinese-Americans sometime around World War II. One theory for why this occurred is because of the Japanese American internment during World War II, which forcibly put over 100,000 Japanese-Americans in internment camps, including those who had produced fortune cookies. This gave an opportunity for Chinese manufacturers.
Fortune cookies before the early 20th century were all made by hand. Fortune cookies are made from a simple batter of sugar, flour, water, and eggs. When heated, the dough stays flexible, allowing it to be shaped. As it cools, the sugar crystallizes, creating a crisp, glossy cookie. Traditionally, bakers would bake 3-inch circles of dough, insert a fortune while still warm, and use chopsticks to fold the cookie into its iconic shape before it hardened. The fortune cookie industry changed dramatically after the fortune cookie machine was invented by Edward Louie in the late 1960s. The machine allowed for mass production of fortune cookies which subsequently allowed the cookies to drop in price to become the novelty and courtesy dessert many Americans are familiar with after their meals at most Chinese restaurants today.

== Manufacturers ==

There are approximately 3 billion fortune cookies made each year globally, the majority of them consumed in the US. The largest manufacturer of the cookies is Wonton Food, Inc., headquartered in Brooklyn, New York. They make over 4.5 million fortune cookies per day. Other large manufacturers are Baily International in the Midwest and Peking Noodle in Los Angeles. There are other smaller, local manufacturers including Tsue Chong Co. in Seattle, Keefer Court Food in Minneapolis, Sunrise Fortune Cookie in Philadelphia, and Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory in San Francisco. Many smaller companies will also sell custom fortunes.

Manufacturing processes vary, but they generally follow the same procedure. The ingredients (typically made with a base of flour, sugar, vanilla, and sesame seed oil) are mixed in a large tank and squirted onto fast moving trays. These function like a conveyor belt and are heated to cook the dough. Cookies are compressed with round hot plates to shape and cook them. The cookies bake for approximately one minute and are reshaped. They can be mechanically shaped or folded by hand. When automated, a machine folds the cookie into the correct orientation with the fortune inside. Cooled and hardened cookies are sealed in plastic wrappers, which are inspected before being shipped. Today, most cookies are produced in the United States with the biggest factory located in Brooklyn.

== Marketing ==

The message inside may include a list of lucky numbers used by some as lottery numbers; since relatively few distinct messages are printed, in the recorded case where winning numbers happened to be printed, the lottery had an unexpectedly high number of winners sharing a prize. Authorities briefly investigated Wonton Food in 2005, after 110 Powerball lottery players won about $19 million after using the &quot;lucky numbers&quot; on the back of fortunes.

Fortune cookies are sometimes used for special marketing promotions. For example, the film &quot;Kung Fu Panda 3&quot; was promoted by putting quotations from the protagonist of the film on fortune cookie slips.

In 1989, fortune cookies were reportedly imported into Hong Kong and sold as &quot;genuine American fortune cookies&quot;. Wonton Food attempted to expand its fortune cookie business into China in 1992, but gave up after fortune cookies were considered &quot;too American&quot;.

== Nutrition ==
Cookies from different manufacturers have different ingredients and nutritional content. One cookie typically contains around of food energy and 5–7 g of total carbohydrates. A cookie may have sugar varying from 0–3 g, between 2–8 mg of sodium, and may have significant (compared to their size) amounts of iron or protein. The small size means they have little overall nutritional value.

== Around the world ==

Fortune cookies, while largely an American item, have been served in Chinese restaurants in Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United Arab Emirates, among others. In Peru, they are served in &quot;chifas&quot;, Chinese-Peruvian fusion food restaurants.

There are also multi-cultural versions of the fortune cookie. For instance, the Mexican version of the fortune cookie, called the &quot;Lucky Taco&quot;, is a red taco-shaped cookie with a fortune inside. The same company that makes the Lucky Taco also makes a &quot;Lucky Cannoli&quot;, inspired by Italian cannolis.

<doc id="49593" wikidata="Q1461873" url="?curid=49593" title="Candiru (fish)">
<text>Candiru (Vandellia cirrhosa), also known as cañero, toothpick fish, or vampire fish, is a species of parasitic freshwater catfish in the family Trichomycteridae native to the Amazon basin where it is found in the countries of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. The name &quot;candiru&quot; is also used to refer to the entire genus &quot;Vandellia&quot;.

This species is known for an alleged tendency to invade and parasitize the human urethra and other bodily openings; however, despite ethnological reports dating back to the late 19th century, the first documented case of the removal of a candiru from a human urethra did not occur until 1997, and even that incident has remained a matter of controversy.

==Description==

&quot;Vandellia cirrhosa&quot; is a small, freshwater catfish. Members of the genus &quot;Vandellia&quot; can reach up to in standard length, but some others can grow to around . The fish has an elongated body with an anterior dorsal fin and pelvic fin, and an anal fin slightly larger than the dorsal fin. The caudal fin is fairly small with a truncated shape. Each has a rather small head and a belly that can appear distended, especially after a large blood meal. The body is translucent, making it quite difficult to spot in the turbid waters of its home. Blood is often visible through the translucent body after feeding. The fish has small eyes with yellow irises. There are short sensory barbels around the head, together with short, backward pointing spines on the gill covers. These spines have been described as popping out in an umbrella-like fashion, which could be used to help lodge the fish into its host.

All members of the subfamily Vandelliinae share the traits of blood parasitism, with parasitism in general being a shared ancestral trait of all members of Trichomycteridae. They have individual claw-like teeth for this purpose. Their bodies are very small and elongated to easily slip into the gills of host fish.

==Habitat and distribution==
Candiru inhabits the Amazon and Orinoco basins of lowland Amazonia. 

This fish lives in shallow water with muddy, sandy, or rocky bottoms. It can be found in riffles. Its distribution is patchy and it does not seem to move very far from its spawning sites.

One location that &quot;Vandellia cirrhosa&quot; is specifically known to inhabit is the Purus River of Brazil. This location is hard to study due to its geographic isolation, something that is common among the habitats of candiru.

== Diet ==
Candiru is hematophagous and parasitizes the gills of larger Amazonian fish, especially catfish of the family Pimelodidae (Siluriformes) and members of the family Characidae. However, it has been known to parasitize many species in the same location, suggesting that its feeding habit is based more on availability than species preference. Vandellinae is one of only two groups of jawed vertebrates that exclusively feed on blood.

The feeding mechanism of the candiru was not understood until fairly recently, but many theories had been proposed before. Some suggested that it uses its sharp teeth to latch onto an artery or vein and stays attached to the host until it has ingested enough blood. It then lets go of the host and continues swimming. Others suggested that it extracts blood from its hosts by latching onto the gill filaments, which bleed freely into the alimentary tract of the candiru. In one experiment involving &quot;Vandellia cirrhosa&quot;, no evidence of gill damage was found on the fish hosts. Thus, the experimenter suggested a hypothetical blood-pumping mechanism in which the candiru is able to quickly ingest large amounts of blood without permanently damaging the host.

Modern experiments have shown that the candiru feeds by approaching a host fish and swimming alongside it until close to the gill cover. It then attempts to penetrate the gill chamber by forcing itself underneath. The candiru has also been seen entering the host through its mouth, though this behavior seems to be rare. While latched onto the host fish&#x27;s gill chamber with sharp teeth, the candiru goes limp and quickly swells up with blood. The gut of this species is a straight tube with loosely-spaced fibers lining the walls of the connective tissue, most likely facilitating the swelling of the belly that is associated with the candiru. The lack of any protrusible jaw supports the theory that this species does not suck blood, but rather bites into a blood vessel and ingests the fluid that flows freely into the mouth. Because the candiru relies on the blood pressure of the host to ingest blood from the ventral or dorsal arteries, host fish must be selected by size.

The time taken to get its fill of blood depends on the size of the candiru and whether it has attached to a large or small blood vessel. Because of the small size of &quot;Vandellia cirrhosa&quot;, it generally seems to take no more than two minutes to ingest the required amount of blood from the host fish. This short duration is theoretically beneficial to the candiru because it is only vulnerable to predators for a short period of time.

In most cases, the host fish do not seem to be badly wounded by this process. There is generally no observable damage to the gill filaments. However, relatively deep crescent or elliptical-shaped wounds with coagulated blood inside can be found beneath the gill cover.

When starving, the candiru may resort to entering unusual orifices such as the nostril of a host fish. This behavior may relate to reported cases of these fish penetrating human orifices such as the urethra.

==Alleged attacks on humans==
Although lurid anecdotes of attacks on humans abound, only one somewhat questionable case has evidence behind it, and some alleged traits of the fish have been discredited as myth or superstition. It is likely that, while the fish&#x27;s spines can cause physical trauma, it merely poses as much danger of actually entering a human as any other fish of its size.

===Historical accounts===
The earliest published report of candiru attacking a human host comes from German biologist C. F. P. von Martius in 1829. The biologist never actually observed this; rather, von Martius was told about it by an interpreter relaying the speech of the native people of the area, who reported that men would tie ligatures around their penises while going into the river to prevent this from happening. Other sources also suggest that other tribes in the area used various forms of protective coverings for their genitals while bathing, though it was also suggested that these were to prevent bites from piranha. Martius also speculated that the fish were attracted by the &quot;odor&quot; of urine. Later experimental evidence has shown this to be false, as the fish actually hunt by sight and have no attraction to urine at all.

Another report, from French naturalist Francis de Castelnau in 1855, relates an allegation by local Araguay fisherman, saying that it is dangerous to urinate in the river as the fish &quot;springs out of the water and penetrates into the urethra by ascending the length of the liquid column.&quot; While Castelnau himself dismissed this claim as &quot;absolutely preposterous&quot;, and the fluid mechanics of such a maneuver defy the laws of physics, it remains one of the more stubborn myths about the candiru. It has been suggested this claim evolved out of the real observation that certain species of fish in the Amazon will gather at the surface near the point where a urine stream enters, having been attracted by the noise and agitation of the water.

In 1836, Eduard Poeppig documented a statement by a local physician in Pará, known only as Dr. Lacerda, who offered an eyewitness account of a case where a candiru had entered a human orifice. However, it was lodged in a native woman&#x27;s vagina, rather than a male urethra. He relates that the fish was extracted after external and internal application of the juice from a Xagua plant (believed to be a name for &quot;Genipa americana&quot;). Another account was documented by biologist George A. Boulenger from a Brazilian physician, named Dr. Bach, who had examined a man and several boys whose penises had been amputated. Bach believed this was a remedy performed because of parasitism by candiru, but he was merely speculating, as he did not speak his patients&#x27; language. American biologist Eugene Willis Gudger noted that the area which the patients were from did not have candiru in its rivers, and suggested the amputations were much more likely the result of having been attacked by piranha.

In 1891, naturalist Paul Le Cointe provides a rare first-hand account of a candiru entering a human body, and like Lacerda&#x27;s account, it involved the fish being lodged in the vaginal canal, not the urethra. Le Cointe supposedly removed the fish himself, by pushing it forward to disengage the spines, turning it around and removing it head-first.

However, the veracity of both Le Cointe&#x27;s and Poeppig&#x27;s accounts are questionable, due to a trend of Europeans from various careers residing in Brazil including scientists, &quot;explorers, medical men, and missionaries&quot; regularly using exaggerated accounts of native people to advance their economic and social status through writing and building rapport with others with similar positions.

Gudger, in 1930, noted there have been several other cases reported wherein the fish was said to have entered the vaginal canal, but not a single case of a candiru entering the anus was ever documented. According to Gudger, this lends credence to the unlikelihood of the fish entering the male urethra, based on the comparatively small opening that would accommodate only the most immature members of the species.

===Modern cases===
To date, there is only one documented case of a candiru entering a human urethra, which took place in Itacoatiara, Brazil, in 1997. In this incident, the victim (a 23-year-old man named Silvio Barbossa, also known as &quot;F.B.C.&quot;) claimed a candiru &quot;jumped&quot; from the water into his urethra as he urinated while thigh-deep in a river. After traveling to Manaus on October 28, 1997, the victim underwent a two-hour urological surgery by Dr. Anoar Samad to remove the fish from his body.

In 1999, American marine biologist Stephen Spotte traveled to Brazil to investigate this particular incident in detail. He recounts the events of his investigation in his book &quot;Candiru: Life and Legend of the Bloodsucking Catfishes&quot;. Spotte met Dr. Samad in person and interviewed him at his practice and home. Samad gave him photos, the original VHS tape of the cystoscopy procedure, and the actual fish&#x27;s body preserved in formalin as his donation to the National Institute of Amazonian Research. Spotte and his colleague Paulo Petry took these materials and examined them at the institute, comparing them with Samad&#x27;s formal paper. While Spotte did not overtly express any conclusions as to the veracity of the incident, he did remark on several observations that were suspicious about the claims of the patient and/or Samad himself.

* According to Samad, the patient claimed &quot;the fish had darted out of the water, up the urine stream, and into his urethra.&quot; While this is the most popularly known legendary trait of the candiru, according to Spotte it has been known conclusively to be a myth for more than a century, as it is impossible because of simple fluid physics.
* The documentation and specimen provided indicate a fish that was 133.5 mm in length and had a head with a diameter of 11.5 mm. This would have required significant force to pry the urethra open to this extent. The candiru has no appendages or other apparatus that would have been necessary to accomplish this, and if it were leaping out of the water as the patient claimed, it would not have had sufficient leverage to force its way inside.
* Samad&#x27;s paper claims the fish must have been attracted by the urine. This belief about the fish has been held for centuries, but was discredited in 2001. While this was merely speculation on Samad&#x27;s part based on the prevailing scientific knowledge at the time, it somewhat erodes the patient&#x27;s story by eliminating the motivation for the fish to have attacked him in the first place.
* Samad claimed the fish had &quot;chewed&quot; its way through the ventral wall of the urethra into the patient&#x27;s scrotum. Spotte notes that the candiru does not possess the right teeth or strong enough dentition to have been capable of this. Additionally, the fish would most likely have died before it could have chewed even a somewhat large part of what was needed to reach it.
* Samad claimed he had to snip the candiru&#x27;s grasping spikes off in order to extract it, yet the specimen provided had all its spikes intact.
* The cystoscopy video depicts traveling into a tubular space (presumed to be the patient&#x27;s urethra) containing the fish&#x27;s carcass and then pulling it out backwards through the urethral opening, something that would have been almost impossible with the fish&#x27;s spikes intact.

When subsequently interviewed, Spotte stated that even if a person were to urinate while &quot;submerged in a stream where candiru live&quot;, the odds of that person being attacked by candiru are &quot;(a)bout the same as being struck by lightning while simultaneously being eaten by a shark.&quot;

== Taxonomy ==
Candiru belong to the family Trichomycteridae, which is monophyletic and contains 207 species. The taxonomic placement of this fish has long been debated, with the first proposed phylogenetic relationships of Trichomycteridae being proposed by Jonathan N. Baskin in 1973. Most proposed phylogenies have relied on morphological data, often placing &quot;Vandellinae&quot; and &quot;Stegophilinae&quot; as sister taxa among the subfamilies. A study conducted by Luis Fernández and Scott A. Schaefer, published in 2009, used DNA sequence data to create the first comprehensive treatment of phylogenetic relationships of trichomycterid catfish. Relationships among &quot;Vandelliinae&quot; were strongly supported, and &quot;Vandellia&quot; was found to be the sister group of &quot;Plectrochilus&quot;. The results of Fernández and Schaefer were fully congruent with previous statements based on morphological data. Nonetheless, the taxonomy of the Vandellia genus is still incomplete and hindered by the fact that several species within the genus have often been attributed the same name.

== Discovery ==
&quot;Vandellia cirrhosa&quot; was discovered in the early 1800s by Alexandre Rodrigues Ferreira, a Native Brazilian scholar studying under the Italian naturalist Professor Domingos Vandelli, of which the fish would be named after. The Spanish name &quot;cañero&quot; is a derivative of &quot;carnero&quot;, meaning flesh-eater.

One of the most well known scientific mentions of the candiru appeared in &quot;The American Journal of Surgery&quot; published in 1930, summarizing the supposedly centuries old tale of a fish that penetrates the urethras of nude bathers in the Amazon.

== Conservation status ==
The remote habitat of the candiru, as well as the indigenous cultural customs surrounding its location, makes it difficult to study. The number of &quot;Vandellia cirrhosa&quot; in the wild is unknown, but there are no conservation efforts in place to protect these fish.

One of its main habitats, the Purus River, is currently the main source of fish for human consumption in the most populous city of the Central Amazon, Manaus. This creates a huge pressure on fish stocks, which may be indirectly affecting the candiru by depleting its population of potential host fish.

<doc id="49597" wikidata="Q366102" url="?curid=49597" title="Nathan Bedford Forrest">
<text>Nathan Bedford Forrest (July 13, 1821October 29, 1877) was a 19th-century American slave trader active in the lower Mississippi River valley, a Confederate States Army general during the American Civil War. He was a founding member and the first Grand Wizard of the Reconstruction-era Ku Klux Klan, serving from 1867 to 1869.

Before the war, Forrest amassed substantial wealth as a horse and cattle trader, real estate broker, slave jail operator, interstate slave trader, and cotton plantation owner. In June 1861, he enlisted in the Confederate Army and became one of the few soldiers during the war to enlist as a private and be promoted to general without previous military training. An expert cavalry leader, Forrest was given command of a corps and established new doctrines for mobile forces, earning the nickname &quot;The Wizard of the Saddle&quot;. He used his cavalry troops as mounted infantry and often deployed artillery as the lead in battle, thus helping to &quot;revolutionize cavalry tactics&quot;. His role in the massacre of several hundred U.S. Army soldiers at Fort Pillow remains controversial, as the most infamous application of the Confederate no-quarter policy toward black enemy combatants. In April 1864, in what has been called &quot;one of the bleakest, saddest events of American military history&quot;, troops under Forrest&#x27;s command at the Battle of Fort Pillow massacred hundreds of surrendered troops, composed of black soldiers and white Tennessean Southern Unionists fighting for the United States. Forrest was blamed for the slaughter in the U.S. press, and this news may have strengthened the United States&#x27;s resolve to win the war. Forrest&#x27;s level of responsibility for the massacre is still debated by historians.

Forrest joined the Ku Klux Klan in 1867 (two years after its founding) and was elected its first Grand Wizard. The group was a secretive network of dens, across the post-war South, where ex-Confederate reactionaries having a good horse and a gun, threatened, assaulted and murdered politically active black people and their allies for political power in a system newly dominated by those whom the unreconstructed termed &quot;niggers, carpetbaggers and scalawags.&quot; The Klan, with Forrest at the lead, suppressed the voting rights of blacks through violence and intimidation during the elections of 1868. In 1869, Forrest expressed disillusionment with the terrorist group&#x27;s lack of discipline, and issued a letter ordering the dissolution of the Ku Klux Klan as well as the destruction of its costumes; he then withdrew from the organization. Forrest later denied being a Klan member, and in the 1870s twice made statements in support of racial harmony and black dignity. During the last years of his life, he served on the board of a railroad and farmed President&#x27;s Island using convict labor. Forrest died of illness in 1877, at the age of 56.

While scholars generally acknowledge Forrest&#x27;s skills and acumen as a cavalry leader and tactician, due to his pre-war slave trading and his post-war leadership of the Klan, he is now considered a shameful signifier of a bleaker, less-equal United States. Forrest&#x27;s racism and use of violence were sanctified by the Lost Cause mythology that was widely promulgated during the nadir of American race relations era, and he continues to be a favorite figure of American white supremacists. As such, in the 21st century, several Forrest monuments and memorials have been removed or renamed to better reflect the current state of race relations in the United States.

==Early life and career==

Nathan Bedford Forrest was born July 13, 1821 to Miriam (Beck) and William Forrest, a poor settler family living in a secluded frontier cabin near the hamlet of Chapel Hill, Tennessee (then part of Bedford County, but now in Marshall County).
His father was of English descent, and while most of Nathan&#x27;s biographers state that his mother was of Scotch-Irish descent, the Memphis Genealogical Society asserts that she, too, was of English descent.

He and his twin sister, Fanny, were the two eldest of 12 children. Their great-grandfather, Shadrach Forrest, moved between 1730 and 1740 from Virginia to North Carolina, where both his son (Bedford&#x27;s grandfather) and grandson (Bedford&#x27;s father) were born; they moved to Tennessee in 1806 and he died in Bedford, Tennessee the year before Nathan Bedford was born. Forrest&#x27;s family lived in a log house (now preserved as the Nathan Bedford Forrest Boyhood Home) from 1830 to 1833. John Allan Wyeth, who served in an Alabama regiment under Forrest, described it as a one-room building with a loft and no windows.

William Forrest continued blacksmithing in Tennessee until 1834, when the family moved to Salem, Mississippi. When his father died in 1837, Nathan became the primary caretaker of the family at age 16. Forrest ventured into a business partnership with his uncle Jonathan Forrest in Hernando, Mississippi in 1841. His uncle was subsequently killed at the business in 1845 by the Matlock brothers during an argument. In retaliation, Bedford shot and killed two of them with his two-shot pistol and wounded two others with a borrowed knife thrown to him. One brother later served under Forrest&#x27;s command, for a time, during the Civil War. Forrest&#x27;s early business ventures included a livery stable, a stagecoach line, and a brickyard. He became well known as a Memphis speculator and Mississippi gambler.
In 1858, Forrest was elected a Memphis city alderman as a Southern Democrat and served two consecutive terms. He purchased two large cotton plantations in Coahoma County, Mississippi and bought a one-half property interest in an Arkansas plantation in 1859; by October 1860, he owned at least 3,345 acres in Mississippi. He acquired several cotton plantations in the Delta region of West Tennessee. By the time the American Civil War started in 1861, he had become one of the wealthiest men in the Southern United States, having amassed a &quot;personal fortune that he claimed was worth $1.5 million&quot;.

Forrest stood in height, weighed about , rarely drank and abstained from tobacco use. He was known as a tireless rider in the saddle and a skilled swordsman. Forrest was noted as having a &quot;striking and commanding presence&quot; by U.S. Army Captain Lewis Hosea, an aide to Gen. James H. Wilson. He was often described as generally mild-mannered, but according to Hosea and other contemporaries who knew him, his demeanor changed drastically when provoked or angered. Although he was not formally educated, according to Spaulding, Forrest was able to read and write clear and grammatical English, although he was a poor speller. He was initiated into Freemasonry, but did not progress beyond the Entered Apprentice degree.

==Marriage and family==
Forrest had twelve brothers and sisters; two of his eight brothers and three of his four sisters died of typhoid fever at an early age, all at about the same time. He also contracted the disease, but survived; his father recovered but died from residual effects of the disease five years later when Bedford was 16. His mother, Miriam, then married James Horatio Luxton, of Marshall, Texas, in 1843 and gave birth to four more children. All of Forrest&#x27;s younger brothersin order, John N. Forrest, William H. Forrest, Aaron H. Forrest, Jesse A. Forrest, and Jeffrey E. Forrestworked as slave traders with Bedford before the war. All but John, who was a disabled veteran of the Mexican–American War, served as Confederate military officers in Tennessee and Mississippi during the American Civil War. Forrest&#x27;s son William M. Forrest served as his aide-de-camp, and his half-brother Mat Luxton was a sergeant and scout in his cavalry.

In 1845, Forrest married Mary Ann Montgomery (1826–1893), the niece of a Presbyterian minister who was her legal guardian. They had two children, William Montgomery Bedford Forrest IIII (1846–1908), who enlisted at the age of 15 and served alongside his father in the war, and a daughter, Fanny (1849–1854), who died in childhood. There are also reports dating to 1864 that Forrest had two children, Thomas and Narcissa, with an enslaved woman named Catharine.

Forrest&#x27;s grandson, Nathan Bedford Forrest II (1872–1931), became commander-in-chief of the Sons of Confederate Veterans and a Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan in Georgia and secretary of the national organization. A great-grandson, Nathan Bedford Forrest III (1905–1943), graduated from West Point and rose to the rank of brigadier general in the U.S. Army Air Corps; he was killed during a bombing raid over Nazi Germany in 1943, becoming the first American general to die in combat in the European theater during World War II.

== Slave trading ==
Nathan Bedford Forrestdisparaged by Parson Brownlow in 1864 as a &quot;sin-hardened negro trader, and livery stable man of Memphis&quot;was a notable slave trader of the United States from 1851 to 1860. Forrest was considered one of the &quot;big four&quot; &quot;phenomenally large&quot; traders of Memphis, which was the &quot;first-class market&quot; for slave trading in Tennessee. He is believed to have sold thousands of slaves during his career and had profits of hundreds of thousands of dollars in 1850s currency. Primarily based in Memphis, he was able to open a second storefront in Vicksburg in 1858. During the American Civil War, Forrest cited his business experience in a written request for an independent command: &quot;I have resided on the Mississippi for over twenty years, was for many years engaged in buying and selling negroes, and know the country perfectly well between Memphis and Vicksburg, and also am well acquainted with all the prominent planters in that region, as well as above Memphis.&quot;

After initially working as an independent slave trader, he was first in partnership with Seaborne S. Jones, second in partnership with Byrd Hill (a more experienced manager of negro marts), third in partnership with Josiah Maples, then again a sole proprietor, and finally reunited with Jones.

Beginning in the Forrest &amp; Maples era, his business was headquartered at 87 Adams Street in Memphis, where several other slave traders had their slave pens and auction yards, thus making the area an efficient business cluster. After the war, a woman named Nellie Harbold placed a family reunification ad hoping to find her children, Lydia, Miley A., and Samuel Tirley, all of whom had been sold to separate buyers out of &quot;the yard of Forrest the Trader&quot; in Memphis in 1854. Forrest was traditionally said to have been trained by the principals of Bolton, Dickens &amp; Co., a multimillion-dollar operation that traded in a dozen Southern cities, but recent research suggests this may be apocryphal. In 1859, media coverage of Forrest&#x27;s business spotlighted a particular product, an enslaved girl said to be the daughter of Frederick Douglass. Historian Tim Huebner asserts this was likely Anna Marie Bailey, a niece of Douglass.


In 1859, a federal investigation found that Forrest also sold 37 individuals illegally imported to the United States from Africa on the slave ship &quot;Wanderer&quot;. Forrest, who advocated for the reopening of the transatlantic slave trade, later told an interviewer that he had been an initial investor in the &quot;Wanderer&quot; shipment. In January 1860, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that the Forrest, Jones &amp; Co. negro mart building in Memphis had both collapsed and then caught fire; two people died. The firm&#x27;s bills of sale for people, &quot;amounting in the aggregate to &quot; were salvaged. Forrest had recently moved from 87 Adams to 89 Adams, which allowed him to increase his holding capacity from a maximum of 300 slaves to a maximum of 500. Forrest subsequently sold his interest in the business after the building catastrophe and reinvested the profit into plantations. A marker was erected at the former site of Forrest&#x27;s slave mart in downtown Memphis, on land currently owned by Calvary Episcopal Church, and was dedicated on April 4, 2018.

==American Civil War==

===Early cavalry command===
After the Civil War broke out, Forrest returned to Tennessee from his Mississippi ventures and enlisted in the Confederate States Army (CSA) on June 14, 1861. He reported for training at Fort Wright near Randolph, Tennessee, joining Captain Josiah White&#x27;s cavalry company, the Tennessee Mounted Rifles (Seventh Tennessee Cavalry), as a private along with his youngest brother and 15-year-old son. Upon seeing how badly equipped the CSA was, Forrest offered to buy horses and equipment with his own money for a regiment of Tennessee volunteer soldiers.

His superior officers and Governor of Tennessee Isham G. Harris were surprised that someone of Forrest&#x27;s wealth and prominence had enlisted as a soldier, especially since significant planters were exempted from service. They commissioned him as a lieutenant colonel and authorized him to recruit and train a battalion of Confederate mounted rangers. In October 1861, Forrest was given command of a regiment, the 3rd Tennessee Cavalry. Though Forrest had no prior formal military training or experience, he had exhibited leadership and soon proved he could successfully employ military tactics.

Forrest gained a reputation for his willingness to maintain discipline through the use of physical force. When the information with which a scout returned proved to be erroneous, Forrest struck the man&#x27;s head against a tree. After a lieutenant refused to join his troops in a river where they were building a bridge, Forrest pushed him into the water. A soldier who refused to paddle across the Tennessee River was hit with an oar by his general. Two others who fled from a rout were beaten with a branch, and Forrest shot the one who had borne the colors. Along with brutal treatment of his prisoners, this led many soldiers and junior officers to refuse to serve under him.

Public debate surrounded Tennessee&#x27;s decision to join the Confederacy, and both the Confederate and United States armies recruited soldiers from the state. Over 100,000 men from Tennessee served with the Confederacy, and over 31,000 served with the U.S. Army. Forrest posted advertisements to join his regiment, with the slogan, &quot;Let&#x27;s have some fun and kill some Yankees!&quot;. Forrest&#x27;s command included his Escort Company (his &quot;Special Forces&quot;), for which he selected the best soldiers available. This unit, which varied in size from 40 to 90 men, constituted the elite of his cavalry.

===Sacramento and Fort Donelson===

Forrest won praise for his performance under fire during an early victory in the Battle of Sacramento in Kentucky, the first in which he commanded troops in the field, where he routed a U.S. Army force by personally leading a cavalry charge that Brigadier General Charles Clark later commended. Forrest distinguished himself further at the Battle of Fort Donelson in February 1862. After his cavalry captured a U.S. artillery battery, he broke out of a siege headed by Major General Ulysses S. Grant, rallying nearly 4,000 troops and leading them to escape across the Cumberland River.

A few days after the Confederate surrender of Fort Donelson, with the fall of Nashville to U.S. forces imminent, Forrest took command of the city. All available carts and wagons were pressed into service to haul 600 boxes of army clothing, 250,000 pounds of bacon, and 40 wagon-loads of ammunition to the railroad depots, to be sent off to Chattanooga and Decatur. Forrest arranged for heavy ordnance machinery, including a new cannon rifling machine and 14 cannons, as well as parts from the Nashville Armory, to be sent to Atlanta for use by the Confederate Army.

===Shiloh and Murfreesboro===
A month later, Forrest was back in action at the Battle of Shiloh, fought April 6–7, 1862. After the U.S. victory, Forrest commanded a Confederate rear guard. In the battle of Fallen Timbers, he drove through the U.S. skirmish line. Not realizing that the rest of his men had halted their charge when they reached the full U.S. brigade, Forrest charged the brigade alone and soon found himself surrounded. He emptied his Colt Army revolvers into the swirling mass of U.S. Army soldiers and pulled out his saber, hacking, and slashing. A U.S. infantryman on the ground beside Forrest fired a musket ball at him with a point-blank shot, nearly knocking him out of the saddle. The ball went through Forrest&#x27;s pelvis and lodged near his spine. A surgeon removed the musket ball a week later without anesthesia, which was unavailable.

By early summer, Forrest commanded a new brigade of inexperienced cavalry regiments. He led them into Middle Tennessee in July under orders to launch a cavalry raid. On July 13, 1862, he led them into the First Battle of Murfreesboro, as a result of which all of the U.S. units surrendered to Forrest. The Confederates destroyed much of the U.S. Army&#x27;s supplies and railroad tracks in the area.

===West Tennessee raids===

Promoted on July 21, 1862, to brigadier general, Forrest was given command of a Confederate cavalry brigade. In December 1862, Forrest&#x27;s veteran troopers were reassigned by General Braxton Bragg to another officer despite his protest. Forrest had to recruit a new brigade of about 2,000 inexperienced men, most of whom lacked weapons. Again, Bragg ordered a series of raids to disrupt the communications of the U.S. Army forces under Grant, which were threatening the city of Vicksburg, Mississippi. Forrest protested that sending such untrained men behind enemy lines was suicidal, but Bragg insisted, and Forrest obeyed his orders. In the ensuing raids, he was pursued by thousands of U.S. soldiers trying to locate his fast-moving forces. Avoiding attack by never staying in one place long, Forrest eventually led his troops during the spring and summer of 1864 on raids into west Tennessee, as far north as the banks of the Ohio River in southwest Kentucky and into north Mississippi.

Forrest returned to his base in Mississippi with more men than he had started with. By then, all were fully armed with captured U.S. Army weapons. As a result, Grant was forced to revise and delay his Vicksburg campaign strategy. Newspaper correspondent Sylvanus Cadwallader, who traveled with Grant for three years during his campaigns, wrote that Forrest &quot;was the only Confederate cavalryman of whom Grant stood in much dread&quot;.

===Dover, Brentwood, and Chattanooga===
The U.S. Army gained military control of Tennessee in 1862 and occupied it for the duration of the war, having taken control of strategic cities and railroads. Forrest continued to lead his men in small-scale operations, including the Battle of Dover and the Battle of Brentwood until April 1863. The Confederate army dispatched him with a small force into the backcountry of northern Alabama and western Georgia to defend against an attack of 3,000 U.S. Army cavalrymen commanded by Colonel Abel Streight. Streight had orders to cut the Confederate railroad south of Chattanooga, Tennessee, to seal off Bragg&#x27;s supply line and force him to retreat into Georgia. Forrest chased Streight&#x27;s men for 16 days, harassing them all the way. Streight&#x27;s goal changed from dismantling the railroad to escaping the pursuit. On May 3, Forrest caught up with Streight&#x27;s unit east of Cedar Bluff, Alabama. Forrest had fewer men than the U.S. side but feigned having a larger force by repeatedly parading some around a hilltop until Streight was convinced to surrender his 1,500 or so exhausted troops (historians Kevin Dougherty and Keith S. Hebert say he had about 1,700 men).

===Day&#x27;s Gap, Chickamauga, and Paducah===
Not all of Forrest&#x27;s exploits of individual combat involved enemy troops. Lieutenant Andrew Wills Gould, an artillery officer in Forrest&#x27;s command, was being transferred, presumably because cannons under his command were spiked (disabled) by the enemy during the Battle of Day&#x27;s Gap. On June 13, 1863, Gould confronted Forrest about his transfer, which escalated into a violent exchange. Gould shot Forrest in the left side, and Forrest mortally stabbed Gould. Forrest was thought to have been fatally wounded by Gould, but he recovered and was ready to fight in the Chickamauga Campaign.

Forrest served with the main army at the Battle of Chickamauga on September 18–20, 1863, in which he pursued the retreating U.S. Army and took hundreds of prisoners. Like several others under Bragg&#x27;s command, he urged an immediate follow-up attack to recapture Chattanooga, which had fallen a few weeks before. Bragg failed to do so, upon which Forrest was quoted as saying, &quot;What does he fight battles for?&quot;

Forrest (along with other subordinates of Bragg) was not blameless for the disorganization that had led Bragg to decide against pursuit after the Chickamauga victory. He and Wheeler had regularly failed throughout the entire Chattanooga campaign to gather intelligence on the disposition of Union forces, in Forrest&#x27;s case because he often involved himself in the thick of battles where he could not gather this information. Forrest also failed tactically on the first day of battle, moving his troops north up the creek in response to a perceived threat instead of screening the Confederate advance as he had been ordered to. As a result, the time it took the infantry to fight for the crossings at Alexander&#x27;s and Reed&#x27;s bridges allowed General William Rosecrans to shore up his Union defenses in the area. That night, Forrest again declined to screen the army&#x27;s right flank; if he had he would have found a wide gap in the Union lines, a misstep that has been called &quot;the most significant intelligence oversight of the entire battle&quot; as it left Bragg utterly uninformed about Union dispositions even as he planned a counterattack. The next morning a poorly planned attack Forrest initiated in that area led to heavy casualties and delayed the counterattack.

In an attempt to build a foothold to retake Chattanooga, Bragg ordered Forrest and Wheeler north after the battle in order that they might disrupt Rosecrans&#x27;s fragile supply line from Nashville. But Forrest diverted to Knoxville, allowing Rosecrans to consolidate his hold on the city, leading Bragg to describe Forrest as &quot;nothing more than a good raider&quot; as he signed orders to transfer Forrest out of his command, to western Tennessee, a month or so later. This supposedly led to a meeting where Forrest confronted and threatened Bragg&#x27;s life, calling him a coward and saying &quot;you might as well not give me any orders, for I will not obey them&quot;, one of several instances in his career where Forrest was openly insubordinate to his superior officers. It is now considered to be apocryphal, although it was repeated in biographies published with Forrest&#x27;s approval, suggesting it reflected his assessment of Bragg.

On December 4, 1863, Forrest was promoted to the rank of major general. On March 25, 1864, Forrest&#x27;s cavalry raided the town of Paducah, Kentucky, in the Battle of Paducah, during which Forrest demanded the surrender of U.S. Colonel Stephen G. Hicks: &quot;if I have to storm your works, you may expect no quarter.&quot; Hicks refused to comply with the ultimatum, and according to his subsequent report, Forrest&#x27;s troops took a position and set up a battery of guns while a flag of truce was still up. As soon as they received the U.S. reply, they moved forward at the command of a junior officer, and the U.S. forces opened fire. The Confederates tried to storm the fort but were repulsed; they rallied and made two more attempts, both of which failed.

===Fort Pillow massacre===
Fort Pillow, located upriver from Memphis (near Henning, Tennessee), was initially constructed by Confederate forces under General Gideon Johnson Pillow on the bluffs of the Mississippi River, and taken over by U.S. forces in 1862 after the Confederates had abandoned the fort. The fort was defended by 557 U.S. Army troops, 295 white and 262 black, under U.S. Army Maj. L.F. Booth.

On April 12, 1864, Forrest&#x27;s men, under Brigadier General James R. Chalmers, attacked and recaptured Fort Pillow. Booth and his adjutant were killed in the battle, leaving Fort Pillow under the command of Major William Bradford. Forrest had reached the fort at 10 a.m. after a hard ride from Mississippi, during which two horses were shot out from under him. By 3:30 p.m., Forrest had concluded that the U.S. troops could not hold the fort; thus, he ordered a flag of truce raised and demanded that the fort be surrendered. As he often did to avoid the high casualties that came with having to storm fortifications, Forrest warned Bradford that he could not be held responsible for what his men might do in the heat of such a battle. Bradford refused to surrender, believing his troops could escape to the U.S. Navy gunboat, USS &quot;New Era&quot;, on the Mississippi River. Forrest&#x27;s men immediately took over the fort, while U.S. Army soldiers retreated to the lower bluffs of the river, but the gunboat did not come to their rescue.

What happened next became known as the Fort Pillow Massacre. As the U.S. Army troops surrendered, Forrest&#x27;s men opened fire, slaughtering black and white U.S. Army soldiers. According to historians John Cimprich and Bruce Tap, although their numbers were roughly equal, two-thirds of the black U.S. Army soldiers were killed, while only a third of the whites were killed. The atrocities at Fort Pillow continued throughout the night. Conflicting accounts of what occurred were given later.

Forrest&#x27;s Confederate forces were accused of subjecting captured U.S. Army soldiers to extreme brutality, with allegations of back-shooting soldiers who fled into the river, shooting wounded soldiers, burning men alive, nailing men to barrels and igniting them, crucifixion, and hacking men to death with sabers. Forrest&#x27;s men were alleged to have set fire to a U.S. barracks with wounded U.S. Army soldiers inside. In defense of their actions, Forrest&#x27;s men insisted that the U.S. soldiers, although fleeing, kept their weapons and frequently turned to shoot, forcing the Confederates to keep firing in self-defense. The rebels said the U.S. flag was still flying over the fort, which indicated that the force had not formally surrendered. A contemporary newspaper account from Jackson, Tennessee, stated that &quot;General Forrest begged them to surrender&quot;, but &quot;not the first sign of surrender was ever given&quot;. Similar accounts were reported in many Confederate newspapers at the time. These statements were contradicted by U.S. Army survivors and by the letter of Achilles Clark, a Confederate soldier with the 20th Tennessee Cavalry who graphically recounted a massacre. Clark wrote to his sisters immediately after the battle:

Following the cessation of hostilities, Forrest transferred the 14 most seriously wounded United States Colored Troops (USCT) to the U.S. steamer &quot;Silver Cloud&quot;. The 226 U.S. Army troops taken prisoner at Fort Pillow were marched under guard to Holly Springs, Mississippi, and then convoyed to Demopolis, Alabama. On April 21, Capt. John Goodwin, of Forrest&#x27;s cavalry command, forwarded a dispatch listing the prisoners captured. The list included the names of 7 officers and 219 white enlisted soldiers. According to Richard L. Fuchs, &quot;records concerning the fate of the black prisoners are either nonexistent or unreliable&quot;. President Abraham Lincoln asked his cabinet for opinions as to how the United States should respond to the massacre.
At the time of the massacre, General Grant was no longer in Tennessee but had transferred to the east to command all U.S. troops. Grant wrote in his memoirs that Forrest, in his report of the battle, had &quot;left out the part which shocks humanity to read&quot;.

Because of the events at Fort Pillow, the U.S. public and press viewed Forrest as a war criminal. A Knoxville correspondent for the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; wrote that Forrest and his brothers were &quot;slave drivers and woman whippers&quot;, while Forrest himself was described as &quot;mean, vindictive, cruel, and unscrupulous&quot;. The Confederate press steadfastly defended Forrest&#x27;s reputation.

According to a historian studying in the Cumberland River valley during the Civil War, &quot;Fully aware of the significance of the large-scale recruitment of black troops, the Confederates did what they could to disrupt it...Forrest himself, operating in west Tennessee, chose to interpret his stunning victory over a racially mixed garrison at Fort Pillow in April as, in part, a warning about using black troops. He described the battle graphically, recounted exaggerated Union casualty figures, and noted, &#x27;It is hoped that these facts will demonstrate to the Northern people that negro soldiers cannot cope with the Southerners.&#x27;&quot;

S.C. Gwynne writes, &quot;Forrest&#x27;s responsibility for the massacre has been actively debated for a century and a half. ... No direct evidence suggests that he ordered the shooting of surrendering or unarmed men, but to fully exonerate him from responsibility is also impossible&quot;.

===Brices Cross Roads and Tupelo===
Forrest&#x27;s most decisive victory came on June 10, 1864, when his 3,500-man force clashed with 8,500 men commanded by U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Samuel D. Sturgis at the Battle of Brices Crossroads in northeastern Mississippi. Here, the mobility of the troops under his command and his superior tactics led to victory, allowing him to continue harassing U.S. forces in southwestern Tennessee and northern Mississippi throughout the war. Forrest set up a position for an attack to repulse a pursuing force commanded by Sturgis, who had been sent to impede Forrest from destroying U.S. Army supply lines and fortifications. When Sturgis&#x27;s Federal army came upon the crossroads, they collided with Forrest&#x27;s cavalry. Sturgis ordered his infantry to advance to the front line to counteract the cavalry. The infantry, tired, weary, and suffering under the heat, were quickly broken and sent into mass retreat. Forrest sent a full charge after the retreating army and captured 16 artillery pieces, 176 wagons, and 1,500 stands of small arms. In all, the maneuver cost Forrest 96 men killed and 396 wounded. The day was worse for U.S. troops, who suffered 223 killed, 394 wounded, and 1,623 missing. The losses were a deep blow to the black regiment under Sturgis&#x27;s command. In the hasty retreat, they stripped off commemorative badges that read &quot;Remember Fort Pillow&quot; to avoid goading the Confederate force pursuing them.

One month later, while serving under General Stephen D. Lee, Forrest experienced tactical defeat at the Battle of Tupelo in 1864. Concerned about U.S. Army supply lines, Maj. Gen. Sherman sent a force under the command of Maj. Gen. Andrew J. Smith to deal with Forrest. U.S. Army forces drove the Confederates from the field, and Forrest was wounded in the foot, but his forces were not wholly destroyed. He continued to oppose U.S. Army efforts in the West for the remainder of the war.

===Tennessee Raids===

Forrest led other raids that summer and fall, including a famous one into U.S. Army-held downtown Memphis in August 1864 (the Second Battle of Memphis) and another on a major U.S. Army supply depot at Johnsonville, Tennessee. On November 4, 1864, during the Battle of Johnsonville, the Confederates shelled the city, sinking three gunboats and nearly thirty other ships and destroying many tons of supplies. During Hood&#x27;s Tennessee Campaign, he fought alongside General John Bell Hood, the newest commander of the Confederate Army of Tennessee, in the Second Battle of Franklin on November 30. Facing a disastrous defeat, Forrest argued bitterly with Hood (his superior officer) demanding permission to cross the Harpeth River and cut off the escape route of U.S. Army Maj. Gen. John M. Schofield&#x27;s army. He eventually attempted, but it was too late.

===Murfreesboro, Nashville, and Selma===

After his bloody defeat at Franklin, Hood continued to Nashville. Hood ordered Forrest to conduct an independent raid against the Murfreesboro garrison. After success in achieving the objectives specified by Hood, Forrest engaged U.S. forces near Murfreesboro on December 5, 1864. In what would be known as the Third Battle of Murfreesboro, a portion of Forrest&#x27;s command broke and ran. When Hood&#x27;s battle-hardened Army of Tennessee, consisting of 40,000 men deployed in three infantry corps plus 10,000 to 15,000 cavalry, was all but destroyed on December 15–16, at the Battle of Nashville, Forrest distinguished himself by commanding the Confederate rear guard in a series of actions that allowed what was left of the army to escape. For this, he would later be promoted to the rank of lieutenant general on March 2, 1865. A portion of his command, now dismounted, was surprised and captured in their camp at Verona, Mississippi on December 25, 1864, during a raid of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad by a brigade of Brig. Gen. Benjamin Grierson&#x27;s cavalry division.

In the spring of 1865, Forrest led an unsuccessful defense of the state of Alabama against Wilson&#x27;s Raid. His opponent, U.S. Army Brig. Gen. James H. Wilson, defeated Forrest at the Battle of Selma on April 2, 1865. A week later, General Robert E. Lee surrendered to Grant in Virginia. When he received news of Lee&#x27;s surrender, Forrest surrendered as well. On May 9, 1865, at Gainesville, Forrest read his farewell address to the men under his command, urging them to &quot;submit to the powers to be, and to aid in restoring peace and establishing law and order throughout the land.&quot;

===War record and promotions===
==Postwar years and later life==

===Business ventures===

As a former slave owner and slave trader, Forrest experienced the abolition of slavery at the war&#x27;s end as a major financial setback. During the war, he became interested in the area around Crowley&#x27;s Ridge and took up civilian life in 1865 in Memphis, Tennessee. In 1866, Forrest and C.C. McCreanor contracted to finish the Memphis &amp; Little Rock Railroad, including a right-of-way that passed over the ridge. The ridgetop commissary he built as a provisioning store for the 1,000 Irish laborers hired to lay the rails became the nucleus of a town, which most residents called &quot;Forrest&#x27;s Town&quot; and which was incorporated as Forrest City, Arkansas in 1870.

The historian Court Carney writes that Forrest was not universally popular in the white Memphis community: he alienated many of the city&#x27;s business people in his commercial dealings and was criticized for questionable business practices that caused him to default on debts.

He later found employment at the Selma-based Marion &amp; Memphis Railroad and eventually became the company president. He was not as successful in railroad promotion as in war, and, under his direction, the company went bankrupt. Nearly ruined as the result of this failure, Forrest spent his final days running an eight-hundred-acre farm on land he leased on President&#x27;s Island in the Mississippi River, where he and his wife lived in a log cabin. There, with the labor of over a hundred prison convicts, he grew corn, potatoes, vegetables, and cotton profitably, but his health steadily declined. In May 1877, Forrest&#x27;s use of convict labor was described as indistinguishable from slavery, in its use of bloodhounds, shotgun-wielding guards, and corporal punishment. Critics also argued it was unjust and exploitative: &quot;The convict farmer has a financial interest in the conviction of as many persons as he may need...and the obsequious and corrupt myrmidons and magistrates of the law can readily supply the demand at a short notice in a country where the unprotected negro is left to steal or starve.&quot;
===Offers his services to Sherman===
During the &quot;Virginius&quot; Affair of 1873, some of Forrest&#x27;s old Confederate friends were filibusters aboard the vessel; consequently, he wrote a letter to the then General-in-Chief of the United States Army William T. Sherman and offered his services in case a war were to break out between the United States and Spain. Sherman, who had recognized how formidable an opponent Forrest was in battle during the Civil War, replied after the crisis settled down. He thanked Forrest for the offer and stated that had war broken out, he would have considered it an honor to have served side by side with him.

===Ku Klux Klan leadership===

Forrest was an early member of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), which was formed by six veterans of the Confederate Army in Pulaski, Tennessee, during the spring of 1866 and soon expanded throughout the state and beyond. Forrest became involved sometime in late 1866 or early 1867. A common report was that Forrest arrived in Nashville while the Klan was meeting at the Maxwell House Hotel in April 1867, probably at the encouragement of former fellow CSA general, turned state Klan leader, George Gordon. The organization had grown to the point that an experienced commander was needed, and Forrest was well-suited to assume the role. In Room 10 of the Maxwell, Forrest was sworn in as a member by John W. Morton. Brian Steel Wills quotes two KKK members who identified Forrest as a Klan leader. James R. Crowe stated, &quot;After the order grew to large numbers we found it necessary to have someone of large experience to command. We chose General Forrest&quot;. Another member wrote, &quot;N. B. Forrest of Confederate fame was at our head, and was known as the Grand Wizard. I heard him make a speech in one of our Dens&quot;. The title &quot;Grand Wizard&quot; was chosen because Forrest had been known as &quot;The Wizard of the Saddle&quot; during the war. According to Jack Hurst&#x27;s 1993 biography, &quot;Two years after Appomattox, Forrest was reincarnated as grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. As the Klan&#x27;s first national leader, he became the Lost Cause of the Confederacy&#x27;s avenging angel, galvanizing a loose collection of boyish secret social clubs into a reactionary instrument of terror still feared today.&quot; Forrest was the Klan&#x27;s first and only Grand Wizard, and he was active in recruitment for the Klan from 1867 to 1868.

Following the war, the United States Congress began passing the Reconstruction Acts to specify conditions for the readmission of former Confederate States to the United States, including ratification of the Fourteenth (1868), and Fifteenth (1870) Amendments to the United States Constitution. The Fourteenth addressed citizenship rights and equal protection of the laws for formerly enslaved people, while the Fifteenth specifically secured the voting rights of black men. According to Wills, in the August 1867 state elections the Klan was relatively restrained in its actions. White Americans who made up the KKK hoped to persuade black voters that returning to their pre-war state of bondage was in their best interest. Forrest assisted in maintaining order. After these efforts failed, Klan violence and intimidation escalated and became widespread. Author Andrew Ward, however, writes, &quot;In the spring of 1867, Forrest and his dragoons launched a campaign of midnight parades; &#x27;ghost&#x27; masquerades; and &#x27;whipping&#x27; and even &#x27;killing Negro voters and white Republicans, to scare blacks off voting and running for office. In 1868, &quot;Klan organizers circulated printed rituals. Forrest and his business partners were then promoting an insurance venture, and their travels facilitated the movement .&quot;

In an 1868 interview by a Cincinnati newspaper, Forrest claimed that the Klan had 40,000 members in Tennessee and 550,000 total members throughout the Southern United States. He said he sympathized with them, but denied any formal connection, although he claimed he could muster thousands of men himself. He described the Klan as &quot;a protective political military organization ... The members are sworn to recognize the government of the United States ... Its objects originally were protection against Loyal Leagues and the Grand Army of the Republic ...&quot;. After only a year as Grand Wizard, in January 1869, faced with an ungovernable membership employing methods that seemed increasingly counterproductive, Forrest dissolved the Klan, ordered their costumes destroyed, and withdrew from participation. His declaration had little effect, and few Klansmen destroyed their robes and hoods.

In 1871, the &quot;U.S. Congressional Committee Report&quot; stated that &quot;The natural tendency of all such organizations is to violence and crime, hence it was that Gen. Forrest and other men of influence by the exercise of their moral power, induced them to disband&quot;.

====Democratic convention 1868====
The Klan&#x27;s activity infiltrated the Democratic Party&#x27;s campaign for the presidential election of 1868. Prominent ex-Confederates, including Forrest, the Grand Wizard of the Klan, and South Carolina&#x27;s Wade Hampton, attended as delegates at the 1868 Democratic Convention, held at Tammany Hall headquarters at 141 East 14th Street in New York City. Forrest rode to the convention on a train that was stopped just outside of a small town along the way, when he was confronted by a well-known fighter shouting &quot;d[amne]d butcher&quot; and wanting to &quot;thrash&quot; him. When Forrest rose and approached the bully, his larger challenger&#x27;s &quot;purpose evaporated.&quot; Former governor of New York Horatio Seymour was nominated as the Democratic presidential candidate, while Forrest&#x27;s friend, Francis Preston Blair Jr., was nominated as the Democratic vice presidential candidate, Seymour&#x27;s running mate. The Seymour–Blair Democratic ticket&#x27;s campaign slogan was: &quot;Our Ticket, Our Motto, This Is a White Man&#x27;s Country; Let White Men Rule&quot;. The Democratic Party platform denounced the Reconstruction Acts as unconstitutional, void, and revolutionary. The party advocated the termination of the Freedman&#x27;s Bureau and any government policy designed to aid blacks in the Southern United States. These developments worked to the advantage of the Republicans, who focused on the Democratic Party&#x27;s alleged disloyalty during and after the Civil War.

====Election of 1868 and Grant====

During the presidential election of 1868, the Ku Klux Klan, under the leadership of Forrest, and other terrorist groups, used brutal violence and intimidation against blacks and Republican voters. Forrest played a prominent role in the spread of the Klan in the Southern United States, meeting with racist whites in Atlanta several times between February and March 1868. Forrest probably organized a statewide Klan network in Georgia during these visits. On March 31, the Klan struck, killing prominent Republican organizer George Ashburn in Columbus.

The Republicans had nominated one of Forrest&#x27;s battle adversaries, U.S. war hero Ulysses S. Grant, for the presidency at their convention held in October. Klansmen took their orders from their former Confederate officers. In Louisiana, 1,000 blacks were killed to suppress Republican voting. In Georgia, blacks and Republicans also faced a lot of violence. The Klan&#x27;s violence was primarily designed to intimidate voters, targeting black and white supporters of the Republican Party. The Klan&#x27;s violent tactics backfired, as Grant, whose slogan was &quot;Let us have peace&quot;, won the election and Republicans gained a majority in Congress. Grant defeated Horatio Seymour, the Democratic presidential candidate, by a comfortable electoral margin, 214 to 80. The popular vote was much closer: Grant received 3,013,365 (52.7%) votes, while Seymour received 2,708,744 (47.3%) votes. Grant lost Georgia and Louisiana, where the violence and intimidation against blacks were most prominent.

====Klan prosecution and Congressional testimony (1871)====
Many in the United States, including President Grant, backed the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, which gave voting rights to American men regardless of &quot;race, color, or previous condition of servitude&quot;. Congress and Grant passed the Enforcement Acts from 1870 to 1871 to protect the &quot;registration, voting, officeholding, or jury service&quot; of African Americans. Under these laws enforced by Grant and the newly formed Department of Justice, there were over 5,000 indictments and 1,000 convictions of Klan members across the Southern United States.

Forrest testified before the Congressional investigation of Klan activities on June 27, 1871. He denied membership, but his role in the KKK was beyond the scope of the investigating committee, which wrote: &quot;Our design is not to connect General Forrest with this order (the reader may form his own conclusion upon this question)&quot;. The committee also noted, &quot;The natural tendency of all such organizations is to violence and crime; hence it was that General Forrest and other men of influence in the state, by the exercise of their moral power, induced them to disband&quot;. George Cantor, a biographer of Confederate generals, wrote, &quot;Forrest ducked and weaved, denying all knowledge, but admitted he knew some of the people involved. He sidestepped some questions and pleaded failure of memory on others. Afterwards, he admitted to &#x27;gentlemanly lies&#x27;. He wanted nothing more to do with the Klan, but felt honor bound to protect former associates.&quot;

====Race and politics (1870s)====

After the lynch mob murder of four black people who had been arrested for defending themselves in a brawl at a barbecue, Forrest wrote to Tennessee governor John C. Brown in August 1874 volunteering to personally lead a posse to punish the &quot;white marauders&quot; responsible. Brown politely declined the offer.

In January 1875, Forrest came to Nashville to work against the re-election of Andrew Johnson for Senate; four of the six other candidates being considered by the Tennessee Assembly were fellow former high officers in the Confederate Army, namely generals John C. Brown, William B. Bate, W. A. Quarles, and Colonel John H. Savage. According to historian Fay W. Brabson, when Forrest arrived Johnson cunningly told him, &quot;When the gods arrive, the half-gods depart; if the people really wanted to bestow honor where honor was due, they should support Forrest for the Senate instead of any one-horse general.&quot; Forrest was duly flattered and left town for Memphis that night, leaving the &quot;lesser military contenders&quot; to fight amongst themselves amidst a losing battle with Johnson.

In his last public appearance, Forrest gave a speech on July 5, 1875 before the Independent Order of Pole-Bearers Association, a post-war organization of black Southerners advocating to both improve black people&#x27;s economic condition and gain equal rights for all citizens. He made what &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as a &quot;friendly speech&quot; during which, when offered a bouquet by the daughter of a Pole Bearers’ officer, he accepted them, thanked the young black woman and kissed her on the cheek. Forrest spoke in encouragement of black advancement and endeavored to be a proponent for espousing peace and harmony between black and white Americans.

In response to the Pole-Bearers speech, the Cavalry Survivors Association of Augusta, the first Confederate organization formed after the war, held a meeting on July 30, 1875 in which Captain Francis Edgeworth Eve, a former enlisted cavalry soldier who had been elected to his rank in the Georgia Hussars, gave a speech expressing strong disapproval of Forrest&#x27;s remarks promoting inter-ethnic harmony, ridiculing his faculties and judgment and berating the woman who gave Forrest flowers as &quot;a mulatto wench&quot;. The association voted unanimously to amend its constitution to expressly forbid publicly advocating for or hinting at any association of white women and girls as being in the same classes as &quot;females of the negro race&quot;. The &quot;Macon Weekly Telegraph&quot; newspaper also condemned Forrest for his speech, describing the event as &quot;the recent disgusting exhibition of himself at the negro jamboree&quot; and quoting part of a &quot;Charlotte Observer&quot; article, which read &quot;We have infinitely more respect for Longstreet, who fraternizes with negro men on public occasions, with the pay for the treason to his race in his pocket, than with Forrest and [General] Pillow, who equalize with the negro women, with only &#x27;futures&#x27; in payment&quot;.

===Death===

Forrest reportedly died from acute complications of diabetes at the Memphis home of his brother Jesse on October 29, 1877. His eulogy was delivered by his recent spiritual mentor, former Confederate chaplain George Tucker Stainback, who declared in his eulogy: &quot;Lieutenant-General Nathan Bedford Forrest, though dead, yet speaketh. His acts have photographed themselves upon the hearts of thousands, and will speak there forever.&quot;

Forrest&#x27;s funeral procession was over two miles long. The crowd of mourners was estimated to include 20,000 people. According to Forrest biographer Jack Hurst, writers present at the public viewing of Forrest&#x27;s body and the funeral procession noted many black citizens among them.
Forrest was buried on October 30, 1877 at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis with military honors and rites as a member of the Oddfellows. In 1904, the remains of Forrest and his wife Mary were disinterred from Elmwood and moved to a Memphis city park that was originally named Forrest Park in his honor but has since been renamed Health Sciences Park.

On July 7, 2015, the Memphis City Council unanimously voted to remove the statue of Forrest from Health Sciences Park, and to return the remains of Forrest and his wife to Elmwood Cemetery. However, on October 13, 2017, the Tennessee Historical Commission invoked the Tennessee Heritage Protection Act of 2013 and U.S. Public Law 85-425: Sec. 410 to overrule the city. Consequently, Memphis sold the park land to Memphis Greenspace, a non-profit entity not subject to the Tennessee Heritage Protection Act, which immediately removed the monument as explained below.

==Historical reputation and legacy==
===Specific monuments===
Many memorials have been erected to Forrest, especially in Tennessee and adjacent southern states. Forrest was elevated in Memphis—where he lived and died—to the status of folk hero. Historian Court Carney suggested that &quot;embarrassed by their city&#x27;s early capitulation during the Civil War, white Memphians desperately needed a hero and therefore crafted a distorted depiction of Forrest&#x27;s role in the war.&quot; Moreover, a &quot;strong Forrest cult exists among fans of the Lost Cause.&quot; Forrest&#x27;s legacy as &quot;one of the most controversial—and popular—icons of the war&quot; still draws heated public debate. , Tennessee had 32 dedicated historical markers linked to Nathan Bedford Forrest, more than were dedicated to all three former Presidents associated with the state combined: Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk, and Andrew Johnson. A Tennessee-based organization, the Sons of Confederate Veterans, posthumously awarded Forrest their Confederate Medal of Honor, created in 1977.

Public schools: High schools named for Forrest were built in Chapel Hill, Tennessee, and Jacksonville, Florida. The school in Jacksonville was named for Forrest in 1959 at the urging of the Daughters of the Confederacy because they were upset about the 1954 &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision. In 2008, the Duval County School Board voted 5–2 against a push to change the name of Nathan Bedford Forrest High School in Jacksonville. In 2013, the board voted 7–0 to begin the process to rename the school. The school was all white until Duval County schools were ordered to be desegregated in 1971, but now more than half the student body is black. After several public forums and discussions, Westside High School was unanimously approved in January 2014 as the school&#x27;s new name. The Forrest Hill Academy high school in Atlanta, Georgia, which had been named for Forrest, was renamed the Hank Aaron New Beginnings Academy in April 2021 after the Atlanta Braves baseball star who had died less than three months prior.

Middle Tennessee State University: In 1978, Middle Tennessee State University abandoned imagery it had formerly used (in 1951, the school&#x27;s yearbook, &quot;The Midlander&quot;, featured the first appearance of Forrest&#x27;s likeness as MTSU&#x27;s official mascot) and MTSU president M. G. Scarlett removed the General&#x27;s image from the university&#x27;s official seal. The Blue Raiders&#x27; athletic mascot was changed to an ambiguous swash-buckler character called the &quot;Blue Raider&quot; to avoid association with Forrest or the Confederacy. The school unveiled its latest mascot, a winged horse named &quot;Lightning&quot; inspired by the mythological Pegasus, during halftime of a basketball game against rival Tennessee State University on January 17, 1998. The ROTC building at MTSU had been named Forrest Hall to honor him in 1958, but the frieze depicting him on horseback that had adorned the side of the building was removed amid protests in 2006. A significant push to change its name failed on February 16, 2018, when the governor-controlled Tennessee Historical Commission denied Middle Tennessee State University&#x27;s petition to rename Forrest Hall.
Mississippi license plate plan: A 2011 proposal by the Sons of Confederate Veterans to honor Forrest with a Mississippi license plate revived tensions and raised objections from Mississippi NAACP chapter president Derrick Johnson, who compared Forrest to Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. The Mississippi NAACP petitioned Governor Haley Barbour to denounce the plates and prevent their distribution. Barbour refused to denounce the honor. Instead, he noted that the state legislature would not likely approve the plate anyway.

Forrest monument in Old Live Oak Cemetery, Selma, Alabama: In 2000, a monument to Forrest was unveiled in Selma, Alabama. The monument to Forrest in the Confederate Circle section of Old Live Oak Cemetery in Selma, Alabama, reads &quot;Defender of Selma, Wizard of the Saddle, Untutored Genius, The first with the most. This monument stands as testament of our perpetual devotion and respect for Lieutenant General Nathan Bedford Forrest. CSA 1821–1877, one of the South&#x27;s finest heroes. In honor of Gen. Forrest&#x27;s unwavering defense of Selma, the great state of Alabama, and the Confederacy, this memorial is dedicated. DEO VINDICE&quot;. The bust of Forrest was stolen from the cemetery monument in March 2012 and replaced in May 2015.

Forrest Park, now Health Sciences Park, in Memphis: A memorial to him, the first Civil War memorial in Memphis, was erected in 1905 in a new Nathan Bedford Forrest Park. In 2005, Shelby County Commissioner Walter Bailey started an effort to move the statue over Forrest&#x27;s grave and rename Forrest Park. Former Memphis Mayor Willie Herenton, who is black, blocked the move. In 2013, Forrest Park in Memphis was renamed the Health Sciences Park amid substantial controversy. In light of the 2015 church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, some Tennessee lawmakers advocated removing a bust of Forrest located in the state&#x27;s Capitol building. Subsequently, then-Mayor A C Wharton urged that the statue of Forrest be removed from the Health Sciences Park and suggested that the remains of Forrest and his wife be relocated to their original burial site in nearby Elmwood Cemetery. In a nearly unanimous vote on July 7, the Memphis City Council passed a resolution in favor of removing the statue and securing the couple&#x27;s remains for transfer. The Tennessee Historical Commission denied removal on October 21, 2016, under the authority granted it by the Tennessee Heritage Protection Act of 2013, which prevents cities and counties from relocating, removing, renaming, or otherwise disturbing without permission war memorials on public property. The city council then voted on December 20, 2017, to sell Health Sciences Park to Memphis Greenspace, a new non-profit corporation not subject to the Heritage Protection Act, which removed the statue and another of Jefferson Davis that same evening. The Sons of Confederate Veterans threatened a lawsuit against the city. On April 18, 2018, the Tennessee House of Representatives punished Memphis by cutting $250,000 (~$ in ) in appropriations for the city&#x27;s bicentennial celebration. On June 3, 2021, the remains of Forrest and his wife were exhumed from their burial place in the park, where they had been for over a century, to be reburied in Columbia, Tennessee. The exhumation and reburial were the results of a campaign that began after the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. The effort was spearheaded by Shelby County Commissioner Tami Sawyer, an educator and Memphis native who founded a group called Take &#x27;Em Down 901 to advocate for the removal of Confederate iconography. After the Forrests&#x27; remains were removed from Memphis, they were reportedly buried in Munford, Tennessee until their reburial in Columbia in September 2021 by the Sons of Confederate Veterans.

Nathan Bedford Forrest Day: The Tennessee legislature established July 13 as &quot;Nathan Bedford Forrest Day&quot;. As of 2019, Nathan Bedford Forrest Day was still observed in Tennessee, though some Democrats in the state had attempted to change the law, which required Tennessee&#x27;s governor to sign a proclamation honoring the holiday. However, since that time, Governor Bill Lee&#x27;s administration introduced a billpassed by the Tennessee legislature on June 10, 2020which released the governor from the former requirement that he proclaim that observance each year and a spokesperson for Governor Lee confirmed that he would not be signing a Forrest Day proclamation in July 2020. In June 2020, after black members of the Tennessee House of Representatives unsuccessfully asked it to eliminate a state celebration of Forrest, Representative Cameron Sexton opined: &quot;I don&#x27;t think anybody here is truly racist. I think people may make insensitive comments.&quot;

Nathan Bedford Forrest bust: A bust sculpted by Jane Baxendale is on display at the Tennessee State Capitol building in Nashville. Brett Joseph Forrest, a direct descendant of Nathan, spoke in support of the bust&#x27;s removal. In 2021 Sexton voted against the removal of the bust of Forrest from the Tennessee State Capitol and into the Tennessee State Museum, but only one other legislator agreed with him, and the bust was removed. Sexton said that he believed the removal of the bust &quot;aligns ... with the teaching of communism.&quot;

Other monuments and memorials:
* Forrest County, Mississippi is named after him, as is Forrest City, Arkansas.
* Obelisks in his memory were placed at his birthplace in Chapel Hill, Tennessee, and at Nathan Bedford Forrest State Park near Camden.
* A monument to Forrest at a corner of Veterans Plaza in Rome, Georgia, was erected by the United Daughters of the Confederacy in 1909 to honor his bravery for defending Rome from U.S. Army Colonel Abel Streight and his cavalry.
* The World War II Army base Camp Forrest in Tullahoma, Tennessee, was named after him. It is now the site of the Arnold Engineering Development Center.
* The Nathan Bedford Forrest Statue in Nashville was particularly notable for its idiosyncratic depiction of Forrest on horseback.
* In August 2000, a road on Fort Bliss named for Forrest decades earlier was renamed for former post commander Richard T. Cassidy.
* In 2023, Forrest Street in Alexandria, Virginia, named after Forrest has been proposed by local legislators for renaming.

===Military doctrines===
Forrest is considered one of the Civil War&#x27;s most brilliant tacticians by the historian Spencer C. Tucker. Forrest fought by simple rules; he maintained that &quot;war means fighting and fighting means killing&quot; and the way to win was &quot;to get there first with the most men&quot;. U.S. Army General William Tecumseh Sherman called him &quot;that devil Forrest&quot; in wartime communications with Ulysses S. Grant and considered him &quot;the most remarkable man our civil war produced on either side&quot;.

Forrest became well known for his early use of maneuver tactics as applied to a mobile horse cavalry deployment. He grasped the doctrines of mobile warfare that would eventually become prevalent in the 20th century. Paramount in his strategy was fast movement, even if it meant pushing his horses at a killing pace, to constantly harass the enemy during raids by disrupting their supply trains and communications with the destruction of railroad tracks and the cutting of telegraph lines, as he wheeled around his opponent&#x27;s flank. The Civil War scholar Bruce Catton writes:

Forrest is often erroneously quoted as saying his strategy was &quot;to git thar fustest with the mostest&quot;. Now often recast as &quot;Getting there firstest with the mostest&quot;, this misquote first appeared in a &quot;New York Tribune&quot; article written to provide colorful comments in reaction to European interest in Civil War generals. The aphorism was addressed and corrected as &quot;Ma&#x27;am, I got there first with the most men&quot; by a &quot;New York Times&quot; story in 1918. Though it was a novel and succinct condensation of the military principles of mass and maneuver, Bruce Catton writes of the spurious quote:
====Criticism====

Military historian Christopher Rein takes a dim view of Forrest. While agreeing that Forrest was a skilled cavalryman, perhaps the best on the Confederate side, and tactically shrewd, Rein points out that the latter quality was most evident only in smaller engagements such as the First Battle of Murfreesboro, Brice&#x27;s Crossroads and Parker&#x27;s Cross Roads, victories that were strategically peripheral to the Confederate cause and often came through bluffery or at the expense of inferior enemy troops. Forrest&#x27;s celebrated personal bravery, willingness to lead from the front and get &quot;in the mix&quot; may have earned him considerable admiration in his day from both sides in the war, Rein notes. But those virtues, he continues, are useful to armies when they are demonstrated by junior officers and enlisted men, not generals who must consider the larger picture, as Forrest failed to do when he led troops to Ebenezer Church rather than prepare a more robust defense at Selma, a loss that effectively ended the war as the Union destroyed the Confederacy&#x27;s last manufacturing center.

As part of larger formations, writes Rein, Forrest&#x27;s tendency to take the initiative and fight without consulting his superiors hurt the Confederacy more than once. His failures at Chickamauga left Bragg with a more ephemeral victory than he might have otherwise gained, at Tupelo he escaped but at the cost of his ability to mount serious raids on Sherman&#x27;s supply lines, and Johnsonville, despite its overwhelming success, hurt the Confederacy as it led Hood to delay his advance into Tennessee, allowing Thomas to consolidate his defenses for the Battle of Nashville, where Union victory ended the Army of Tennessee as a force to reckon with, and with it the Confederacy&#x27;s Western Theater campaign.

In the anthology &quot;The Worst Military Leaders in History&quot;, Rein further contends that the glorification of Forrest and his tactical brilliance by his many defenders, many like him minimally educated U.S. military cadets from the South who have seen him as also exemplifying the Southern virtues celebrated by the Lost Cause of the Confederacy myth, has had longterm negative effects on U.S. military performance:
===Fort Pillow===

Modern historians generally believe that Forrest&#x27;s attack on Fort Pillow was a massacre, noting high casualty rates and the rebels targeting black soldiers. Forrest&#x27;s claim that the Fort Pillow massacre was an invention of U.S. reporters is contradicted by letters written by Confederate soldiers to their own families, which described extreme brutality on the part of Confederate troops. It was the Confederacy&#x27;s publicly stated position that former slaves firing on whites would be killed on the spot, along with Southern whites that fought for the Union, whom the Confederacy considered traitors. According to this analysis, Forrest&#x27;s troops were carrying out Confederate policy. The historical record does not support his repeated denials that he knew a massacre was taking place or that he even knew a massacre had occurred at all.
Consequently, his role at Fort Pillow was a stigmatizing one for him the rest of his life, both professionally and personally, and contributed to his business problems after the war.

Historians have differed in their interpretations of the events at Fort Pillow. Richard L. Fuchs, author of &quot;An Unerring Fire&quot;, concluded:

Andrew Ward downplays the controversy:

John Cimprich states:

The site is now a Tennessee State Historic Park.

Grant himself described Forrest as &quot;a brave and intrepid cavalry general&quot; while noting that Forrest sent a dispatch on the Fort Pillow Massacre &quot;in which he left out the part which shocks humanity to read&quot;.

===In popular culture===
In the 1990 PBS documentary &quot;The Civil War&quot; by Ken Burns, historian Shelby Foote states in Episode 7 that the Civil War produced two &quot;authentic geniuses&quot;: Abraham Lincoln and Nathan Bedford Forrest. When he expressed his opinion to one of Forrest&#x27;s granddaughters, she replied after a pause, &quot;You know, we never thought much of Mr. Lincoln in my family&quot;. Foote also made Forrest a major character in his novel &quot;Shiloh&quot;, which used numerous first-person stories to illustrate a detailed timeline and account of the battle.

Tom Hanks&#x27;s title character in the film &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; remarks in one scene that his mother named him after Nathan Bedford Forrest and &quot;we was related to him in some way&quot;. The following scene satirically depicts Hanks as Forrest in a Ku Klux Klan outfit, donning a hood and being superimposed into scenes of the Klan from &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;.

<text>A pigment is a powder used to add color or change visual appearance. Pigments are completely or nearly insoluble and chemically unreactive in water or another medium; in contrast, dyes are colored substances which are soluble or go into solution at some stage in their use. Dyes are often organic compounds whereas pigments are often inorganic. Pigments of prehistoric and historic value include ochre, charcoal, and lapis lazuli.
==Economic impact==
In 2006, around 7.4 million tons of inorganic, organic, and special pigments were marketed worldwide. According to an April 2018 report by &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot;, the estimated value of the pigment industry globally is $30 billion. The value of titanium dioxide – used to enhance the white brightness of many products – was placed at $13.2 billion per year, while the color Ferrari red is valued at $300 million each year.

==Physical principles==
Like all materials, the color of pigments arises because they absorb only certain wavelengths of visible light. The bonding properties of the material determine the wavelength and efficiency of light absorption. Light of other wavelengths are reflected or scattered. The reflected light spectrum defines the color that we observe.

The appearance of pigments is sensitive to the source light. Sunlight has a high color temperature and a fairly uniform spectrum. Sunlight is considered a standard for white light. Artificial light sources are less uniform.

Color spaces used to represent colors numerically must specify their light source. Lab color measurements, unless otherwise noted, assume that the measurement was recorded under a D65 light source, or &quot;Daylight 6500 K&quot;, which is roughly the color temperature of sunlight.
Other properties of a color, such as its saturation or lightness, may be determined by the other substances that accompany pigments. Binders and fillers can affect the color.

==History==
Minerals have been used as colorants since prehistoric times. Early humans used paint for aesthetic purposes such as body decoration. Pigments and paint grinding equipment believed to be between 350,000 and 400,000 years old have been reported in a cave at Twin Rivers, near Lusaka, Zambia. Ochre, iron oxide, was the first color of paint. A favored blue pigment was derived from lapis lazuli. Pigments based on minerals and clays often bear the name of the city or region where they were originally mined. Raw sienna and burnt sienna came from Siena, Italy, while raw umber and burnt umber came from Umbria. These pigments were among the easiest to synthesize, and chemists created modern colors based on the originals. These were more consistent than colors mined from the original ore bodies, but the place names remained. Also found in many Paleolithic and Neolithic cave paintings are Red Ochre, anhydrous Fe2O3, and the hydrated Yellow Ochre (Fe2O3.H2O). Charcoal—or carbon black—has also been used as a black pigment since prehistoric times.

The first known synthetic pigment was Egyptian blue, which is first attested on an alabaster bowl in Egypt dated to Naqada III (&quot;circa&quot; 3250 BC). Egyptian blue (blue frit), calcium copper silicate CaCuSi4O10, made by heating a mixture of quartz sand, lime, a flux and a copper source, such as malachite. Already invented in the Predynastic Period of Egypt, its use became widespread by the 4th Dynasty. It was the blue pigment par excellence of Roman antiquity; its art technological traces vanished in the course of the Middle Ages until its rediscovery in the context of the Egyptian campaign and the excavations in Pompeii and Herculaneum. Later premodern synthetic pigments include white lead (basic lead carbonate, (PbCO3)2Pb(OH)2), vermilion, verdigris, and lead-tin yellow. Vermilion, a mercury sulfide, was originally made by grinding a powder of natural cinnabar. From the 17th century on, it was also synthesized from the elements. It was favored by old masters such as Titian. Indian yellow was once produced by collecting the urine of cattle that had been fed only mango leaves. Dutch and Flemish painters of the 17th and 18th centuries favored it for its luminescent qualities, and often used it to represent sunlight. Since mango leaves are nutritionally inadequate for cattle, the practice of harvesting Indian yellow was eventually declared to be inhumane. Modern hues of Indian yellow are made from synthetic pigments. Vermillion has been partially replaced in by cadmium reds.

Because of the cost of lapis lazuli, substitutes were often used. Prussian blue, the oldest modern synthetic pigment, was discovered by accident in 1704. By the early 19th century, synthetic and metallic blue pigments included French ultramarine, a synthetic form of lapis lazuli. Ultramarine was manufactured by treating aluminium silicate with sulfur. Various forms of cobalt blue and Cerulean blue were also introduced. In the early 20th century, Phthalo Blue, a synthetic metallo-organic pigment was prepared. At the same time, Royal Blue, another name once given to tints produced from lapis lazuli, has evolved to signify a much lighter and brighter color, and is usually mixed from Phthalo Blue and titanium dioxide, or from inexpensive synthetic blue dyes.

The discovery in 1856 of mauveine, the first aniline dyes, was a forerunner for the development of hundreds of synthetic dyes and pigments like azo and diazo compounds. These dyes ushered in the flourishing of organic chemistry, including systematic designs of colorants. The development of organic chemistry diminished the dependence on inorganic pigments.

==Manufacturing and industrial standards==
Before the development of synthetic pigments, and the refinement of techniques for extracting mineral pigments, batches of color were often inconsistent. With the development of a modern color industry, manufacturers and professionals have cooperated to create international standards for identifying, producing, measuring, and testing colors.

First published in 1905, the Munsell color system became the foundation for a series of color models, providing objective methods for the measurement of color. The Munsell system describes a color in three dimensions, hue, value (lightness), and chroma (color purity), where chroma is the difference from gray at a given hue and value.

By the middle 20th century, standardized methods for pigment chemistry were available, part of an international movement to create such standards in industry. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) develops technical standards for the manufacture of pigments and dyes. ISO standards define various industrial and chemical properties, and how to test for them. The principal ISO standards that relate to all pigments are as follows:
* ISO-787 General methods of test for pigments and extenders.
* ISO-8780 Methods of dispersion for assessment of dispersion characteristics.

Other ISO standards pertain to particular classes or categories of pigments, based on their chemical composition, such as ultramarine pigments, titanium dioxide, iron oxide pigments, and so forth.

Many manufacturers of paints, inks, textiles, plastics, and colors have voluntarily adopted the Colour Index International (CII) as a standard for identifying the pigments that they use in manufacturing particular colors. First published in 1925—and now published jointly on the web by the Society of Dyers and Colourists (United Kingdom) and the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (US)—this index is recognized internationally as the authoritative reference on colorants. It encompasses more than 27,000 products under more than 13,000 generic color index names.

In the CII schema, each pigment has a generic index number that identifies it chemically, regardless of proprietary and historic names. For example, Phthalocyanine Blue BN has been known by a variety of generic and proprietary names since its discovery in the 1930s. In much of Europe, phthalocyanine blue is better known as Helio Blue, or by a proprietary name such as Winsor Blue. An American paint manufacturer, Grumbacher, registered an alternate spelling (Thanos Blue) as a trademark. Colour Index International resolves all these conflicting historic, generic, and proprietary names so that manufacturers and consumers can identify the pigment (or dye) used in a particular color product. In the CII, all phthalocyanine blue pigments are designated by a generic color index number as either PB15 or PB16, short for pigment blue 15 and pigment blue 16; these two numbers reflect slight variations in molecular structure, which produce a slightly more greenish or reddish blue.

==Figures of merit==
The following are some of the attributes of pigments that determine their suitability for particular manufacturing processes and applications:
* Lightfastness and sensitivity for damage from ultraviolet light
* Heat stability
* Toxicity
* Tinting strength
* Staining
* Dispersion (which can be measured with a Hegman gauge)
* Opacity or transparency
* Resistance to alkalis and acids
* Reactions and interactions between pigments

==Swatches==
Swatches are used to communicate colors accurately. The types of swatches are dictated by the media, i.e., printing, computers, plastics, and textiles. Generally, the medium that offers the broadest gamut of color shades is widely used across diverse media.

===Printed swatches===
Reference standards are provided by printed swatches of color shades. PANTONE, RAL, Munsell, etc. are widely used standards of color communication across diverse media like printing, plastics, and textiles.

===Plastic swatches===
Companies manufacturing color masterbatches and pigments for plastics offer plastic swatches in injection molded color chips. These color chips are supplied to the designer or customer to choose and select the color for their specific plastic products.

Plastic swatches are available in various special effects like pearl, metallic, fluorescent, sparkle, mosaic etc. However, these effects are difficult to replicate on other media like print and computer display. Plastic swatches have been created by 3D modelling to including various special effects.

===Computer swatches===
The appearance of pigments in natural light is difficult to replicate on a computer display. Approximations are required. The Munsell Color System provides an objective measure of color in three dimensions: hue, value (or lightness), and chroma. Computer displays in general fail to show the true chroma of many pigments, but the hue and lightness can be reproduced with relative accuracy. However, when the gamma of a computer display deviates from the reference value, the hue is also systematically biased.

The following approximations assume a display device at gamma 2.2, using the sRGB color space. The further a display device deviates from these standards, the less accurate these swatches will be. Swatches are based on the average measurements of several lots of single-pigment watercolor paints, converted from Lab color space to sRGB color space for viewing on a computer display. The appearance of a pigment may depend on the brand and even the batch. Furthermore, pigments have inherently complex reflectance spectra that will render their color appearance greatly different depending on the spectrum of the source illumination, a property called metamerism. Averaged measurements of pigment samples will only yield approximations of their true appearance under a specific source of illumination. Computer display systems use a technique called chromatic adaptation transforms to emulate the correlated color temperature of illumination sources, and cannot perfectly reproduce the intricate spectral combinations originally seen. In many cases, the perceived color of a pigment falls outside of the gamut of computer displays and a method called gamut mapping is used to approximate the true appearance. Gamut mapping trades off any one of lightness, hue, or saturation accuracy to render the color on screen, depending on the priority chosen in the conversion&#x27;s ICC rendering intent.

==Biological pigments==

In biology, a pigment is any colored material of plant or animal cells. Many biological structures, such as skin, eyes, fur, and hair contain pigments (such as melanin).
Animal skin coloration often comes about through specialized cells called chromatophores, which animals such as the octopus and chameleon can control to vary the animal&#x27;s color. Many conditions affect the levels or nature of pigments in plant, animal, some protista, or fungus cells. For instance, the disorder called albinism affects the level of melanin production in animals.

Pigmentation in organisms serves many biological purposes, including camouflage, mimicry, aposematism (warning), sexual selection and other forms of signalling, photosynthesis (in plants), and basic physical purposes such as protection from sunburn.

Pigment color differs from structural color in that pigment color is the same for all viewing angles, whereas structural color is the result of selective reflection or iridescence, usually because of multilayer structures. For example, butterfly wings typically contain structural color, although many butterflies have cells that contain pigment as well.

<text>Mantophasmatidae is a family of carnivorous wingless insects within the monotypic order Mantophasmatodea, which was discovered in Africa in 2001. Recent evidence indicates a sister group relationship with Grylloblattidae (classified in the order Grylloblattodea), and Arillo and Engel have combined the two groups into a single order, Notoptera, with Grylloblattodea and Mantophasmatodea ranked as suborders.

==Overview==
The most common vernacular name for this order is gladiators, although they also are called rock crawlers, heelwalkers, mantophasmids, and colloquially, mantos. Their modern centre of endemism is western South Africa and Namibia (Brandberg Massif), although the modern relict population of &quot;Tanzaniophasma subsolana&quot; in Tanzania and Eocene fossils suggest a wider ancient distribution.

Mantophasmatodea are wingless even as adults, making them relatively difficult to identify. They resemble a cross between praying mantises and phasmids, and molecular evidence indicates that they are most closely related to the equally enigmatic group Grylloblattodea. Initially, the gladiators were described from old museum specimens that originally were found in Namibia (&quot;Mantophasma zephyra&quot;) and Tanzania (&quot;M. subsolana&quot;), and from a 45-million-year-old specimen of Baltic amber (&quot;Raptophasma kerneggeri&quot;).

Live specimens were found in Namibia by an international expedition in early 2002; &quot;Tyrannophasma gladiator&quot; was found on the Brandberg Massif, and &quot;Mantophasma zephyra&quot; was found on the Erongoberg Massif.

Since then, a number of new genera and species have been discovered, the most recent being two new genera, &quot;Kuboesphasma&quot; and &quot;Minutophasma&quot;, each with a single species, described from Richtersveld in South Africa in 2018.

== Biology ==
Mantophasmatids are wingless carnivores. During courtship, they communicate using vibrations transmitted through the ground or substrate.

==Classification==
The classification of Mantophasmatodea in Arillo &amp; Engel (2006) recognizes numerous genera, including fossils, in a single family Manophasmatidae:

**** Species &quot;Karoophasma botterkloofense&quot; 
*** Genus &quot;Kuboesphasma&quot; – South Africa
**** Species &quot;Kuboesphasma compactum&quot; 
*** Genus &quot;Lobatophasma&quot; (formerly &quot;Lobophasma&quot; ) – South Africa

**** Species &quot;Striatophasma naukluftense&quot; 
*** Genus &quot;Viridiphasma&quot; – South Africa
**** Species &quot;Viridiphasma clanwilliamense&quot; 

Some taxonomists assign full family status to the subfamilies and tribes, and sub-ordinal status to the family. In total, there are 21 extant species described as of 2018.

<doc id="49603" wikidata="Q10285" url="?curid=49603" title="Colosseum">
<text>The Colosseum ( ; , ultimately from Ancient Greek word &quot;kolossos&quot; meaning a large statue or giant) is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world, despite its age. Construction began under the Emperor Vespasian () in 72 and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus (). Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (). The three emperors who were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre (; ) by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family name (Flavius).

The Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete. It could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its history, having an average audience of some 65,000; it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, dramas based on Roman mythology, and briefly mock sea battles. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.

Although substantially ruined by earthquakes and stone robbers taking &quot;spolia&quot;, the Colosseum is still a renowned symbol of Imperial Rome and was listed as one of the New 7 Wonders of the World. It is one of Rome&#x27;s most popular tourist attractions and has links to the Catholic Church, as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit &quot;Way of the Cross&quot; procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum. The Colosseum is depicted on the Italian version of the 5 euro cent coin.

==Name==

Originally, the building&#x27;s Latin name was simply . Though the modern name Flavian Amphitheatre () is often used, there is no evidence it was used in classical antiquity. This name refers to the patronage of the Flavian dynasty, during whose reigns the building was constructed, but the structure is better known as the Colosseum. In antiquity, Romans may have referred to the Colosseum by the unofficial name &quot;Amphitheatrum Caesareum&quot; (with &quot;Caesareum&quot; an adjective pertaining to the title &quot;Caesar&quot;), but this name may have been strictly poetic as it was not exclusive to the Colosseum; Vespasian and Titus, builders of the Colosseum, also constructed a Flavian Amphitheatre in Puteoli (modern Pozzuoli).

The name &quot;Colosseum&quot; is believed to be derived from a colossal statue of Nero on the model of the Colossus of Rhodes. The giant bronze sculpture of Nero as a solar deity was moved to its position beside the amphitheatre by the emperor Hadrian (). The word &quot;colosseum&quot; is a neuter Latin noun formed from the adjective &quot;colosseus&quot;, meaning &quot;gigantic&quot; or &quot;colossean&quot;. By the year 1000 the Latin name &quot;Colosseum&quot; had been coined to refer to the amphitheatre from the nearby &quot;Colossus Solis&quot;.

In the 8th century, an epigram attributed to the Venerable Bede celebrated the symbolic significance of the statue in a prophecy that is variously quoted: &quot;Quamdiu stat Colisæus, stat et Roma; quando cadet colisæus, cadet et Roma; quando cadet Roma, cadet et mundus&quot; (&quot;as long as the Colossus stands, so shall Rome; when the Colossus falls, Rome shall fall; when Rome falls, so falls the world&quot;). This is often mistranslated to refer to the Colosseum rather than the Colossus (as in, for instance, Byron&#x27;s poem &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot;). However, at the time that the Pseudo-Bede wrote, the masculine noun &quot;coliseus&quot; was applied to the statue rather than to the amphitheatre.

The spelling was sometimes altered in and &quot;coliseum&quot; are attested from the 12th and 14th centuries respectively. In the 12th century, the structure was recorded as the . In the High Middle Ages, the Flavian amphitheatre is attested as the late 13th-century , and in by the early 16th century, by which time the word could be applied to any amphitheatre. From derived the , in use by the middle of the 15th century and employed by John Capgrave in his &quot;Solace of Pilgrims&quot;, in which he remarked: . An English translation by John Bourchier, 2nd Baron Berners, of Antonio de Guevara&#x27;s biography of Marcus Aurelius () in about 1533 referred to ... Similarly, the , or , are attested as referring first to the amphitheatre in Rome, and then to any amphitheatre (as in 1367).

The earliest citation for the name Colosseum in Early Modern English is the 1600 translation, by Philemon Holland, of the &quot;Urbis Romae topographia&quot; of Bartolomeo Marliani, which he used in the preparation of his translation of Livy&#x27;s Augustan era &quot;Ab Urbe Condita Libri&quot;. The text states: &quot;This Amphitheatre was commonly called Colosseum, of Neroes Colossus, which was set up in the porch of Neroes house.&quot; Similarly, John Evelyn, translating the used by the architectural theorist Roland Fréart de Chambray, wrote &quot;And &#x27;tis indeed a kind of miracle to see that the Colosseum … and innumerable other Structures which seemed to have been built for Eternity, should be at present so ruinous and dilapidated&quot;.

== History ==

=== Construction, inauguration, and Roman renovations ===

The site chosen was a flat area on the floor of a low valley between the Caelian, Esquiline and Palatine Hills, through which a canalised stream ran as well as an artificial lake/marsh. By the 2nd century BC the area was densely inhabited. It was devastated by the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD, following which Nero seized much of the area to add to his personal domain. He built the grandiose Domus Aurea on the site, in front of which he created an artificial lake surrounded by pavilions, gardens and porticoes. The existing Aqua Claudia aqueduct was extended to supply water to the area and the gigantic bronze Colossus of Nero was set up nearby at the entrance to the Domus Aurea. Although the Colossus was preserved, much of the Domus Aurea was torn down. The lake was filled in and the land reused as the location for the new Flavian Amphitheatre. Gladiatorial schools and other support buildings were constructed nearby within the former grounds of the Domus Aurea. Vespasian&#x27;s decision to build the Colosseum on the site of Nero&#x27;s lake can be seen as a populist gesture of returning to the people an area of the city which Nero had appropriated for his own use. In contrast to many other amphitheatres, which were on the outskirts of a city, the Colosseum was constructed in the city centre, in effect, placing it both symbolically and geographically at the heart of Rome.

Construction was funded by the opulent spoils taken from the Jewish Temple after the First Jewish–Roman War in 70 AD led to the Siege of Jerusalem. According to a reconstructed inscription found on the site, &quot;the emperor Vespasian ordered this new amphitheatre to be erected from his general&#x27;s share of the booty.&quot; It is often assumed that Jewish prisoners of war were brought back to Rome and contributed to the massive workforce needed for the construction of the amphitheatre. This claim is disputed; it would, nonetheless, be commensurate with Roman practice to add humiliation to the defeated population. Along with this free source of unskilled labor, teams of professional Roman builders, engineers, artists, painters and decorators undertook the more specialized tasks necessary for building the Colosseum. The Colosseum was constructed with several different materials: wood, limestone, tuff, tiles, cement, and mortar.

Construction of the Colosseum began under the rule of Vespasian in around 70–72 AD (73–75 AD according to some sources). The Colosseum had been completed up to the third story by the time of Vespasian&#x27;s death in 79. The top level was finished by his son, Titus, in 80, and the inaugural games were held in 80 or 81 AD. Dio Cassius recounts that over 9,000 wild animals were killed during the inaugural games of the amphitheatre. Commemorative coinage was issued celebrating the inauguration. The building was remodelled further under Vespasian&#x27;s younger son, the newly designated Emperor Domitian, who constructed the &quot;hypogeum&quot;, a series of tunnels used to house animals and slaves. He also added a gallery to the top of the Colosseum to increase its seating capacity.

In 217, the Colosseum was badly damaged by a major fire (caused by lightning, according to Dio Cassius), which destroyed the wooden upper levels of the amphitheatre&#x27;s interior. It was not fully repaired until about 240 and underwent further repairs in 250 or 252 and again in 320. Honorius banned the practice of gladiator fights in 399 and again in 404. Gladiatorial fights are last mentioned around 435. An inscription records the restoration of various parts of the Colosseum under Theodosius II and Valentinian III (reigned 425–455), possibly to repair damage caused by a major earthquake in 443; more work followed in 484 and 508. The arena continued to be used for contests well into the 6th century. Animal hunts continued until at least 523, when Anicius Maximus celebrated his consulship with some &quot;venationes&quot;, criticised by King Theodoric the Great for their high cost.

=== Medieval ===

The Colosseum underwent several radical changes of use. By the late 6th century a small chapel had been built into the structure of the amphitheater, though this apparently did not confer any particular religious significance on the building as a whole. The arena was converted into a cemetery. The numerous vaulted spaces in the arcades under the seating were converted into housing and workshops, and are recorded as still being rented out as late as the 12th century. Around 1200 the Frangipani family took over the Colosseum and fortified it, apparently using it as a castle. In the early to mid 14th century, the Pope&#x27;s relocation to Avignon caused a population decline in Rome that left the region insecure. The colosseum was largely abandoned by the public and became a popular den for bandits.

Severe damage was inflicted on the Colosseum by the great earthquake in 1349, causing the outer south side, lying on a less stable alluvial terrain, to collapse. Much of the tumbled stone was reused to build palaces, churches, hospitals and other buildings elsewhere in Rome. In 1377, after the Pope&#x27;s return to Rome, the Colosseum was restored by a religious order called Arciconfraternita del SS. Salvatore ad Sancta Sanctorum, who then inhabited a northern portion of it until as late as the early 19th century. The interior of the amphitheater was extensively stripped of stone, which was reused elsewhere, or (in the case of the marble façade) was burned to make quicklime. The iron clamps which held the stonework together were pried or hacked out of the walls, leaving numerous pockmarks which still scar the building today.

=== Modern ===

During the 16th and 17th century, Church officials sought a productive role for the Colosseum. Pope Sixtus V (1585–1590) planned to turn the building into a wool factory to provide employment for Rome&#x27;s prostitutes, though this proposal fell through with his premature death. In 1671, Cardinal Paluzzo Altieri authorized its use for bullfights; a public outcry caused the idea to be hastily abandoned.
In 1749, Pope Benedict XIV endorsed the view that the Colosseum was a sacred site where early Christians had been martyred. He forbade the use of the Colosseum as a quarry and consecrated the building to the Passion of Christ and installed Stations of the Cross, declaring it sanctified by the blood of the Christian martyrs who perished there (&quot;see Significance in Christianity&quot;).

However, there is no historical evidence to support Benedict&#x27;s claim, nor is there even any evidence that anyone before the 16th century suggested this might be the case; the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; concludes that there are no historical grounds for the supposition, other than the reasonably plausible conjecture that some of the many martyrs may well have been.
Later popes initiated various stabilization and restoration projects, removing the extensive vegetation which had overgrown the structure and threatened to damage it further. The façade was reinforced with triangular brick wedges in 1807 and 1827, and the interior was repaired in 1831, 1846 and in the 1930s. The arena substructure was partly excavated in 1810–1814 and 1874 and was fully exposed under Benito Mussolini in the 1930s.

The Colosseum is today one of Rome&#x27;s most popular tourist attractions, receiving millions of visitors annually. The effects of pollution and general deterioration over time prompted a major restoration programme carried out between 1993 and 2000, at a cost of 40 billion lire ($19.3 million or €20.6 million at 2000 prices).
In recent years, the Colosseum has become a symbol of the international campaign against capital punishment, which was abolished in Italy in 1948. Several anti–death penalty demonstrations took place in front of the Colosseum in 2000. Since that time, as a gesture against the death penalty, the local authorities of Rome change the color of the Colosseum&#x27;s night time illumination from white to gold whenever a person condemned to the death penalty anywhere in the world gets their sentence commuted or is released, or if a jurisdiction abolishes the death penalty. Most recently, the Colosseum was illuminated in gold in November 2012 following the abolishment of capital punishment in the American state of Connecticut in April 2012.

Because of the ruined state of the interior, it is impractical to use the Colosseum to host large events; only a few hundred spectators can be accommodated in temporary seating. However, much larger concerts have been held just outside, using the Colosseum as a backdrop. Performers who have played at the Colosseum in recent years have included Ray Charles (May 2002), Paul McCartney (May 2003), Elton John (September 2005), and Billy Joel (July 2006).

== Physical description ==

=== Exterior ===

Unlike Roman theatres that were built into hillsides, the Colosseum is an entirely free-standing structure. It derives its basic exterior and interior architecture from that of two theatres back to back. It is elliptical in plan and is 189 meters (615 ft / 640 Roman feet) long, and 156 meters (510 ft / 528 Roman feet) wide, with a base area of . The height of the outer wall is 48 meters (157 ft / 165 Roman feet). The perimeter originally measured 545 meters (1,788 ft / 1,835 Roman feet). The central arena is an ellipse 87 m (287 ft) long and 55 m (180 ft) wide, surrounded by a wall 5 m (15 ft) high, above which rose tiers of seating.

The outer wall is estimated to have required over of travertine stone which were set without mortar; they were held together by 300 tons of iron clamps. However, it has suffered extensive damage over the centuries, with large segments having collapsed following earthquakes. The north side of the perimeter wall is still standing; the distinctive triangular brick wedges at each end are modern additions, having been constructed in the early 19th century to shore up the wall. The remainder of the present-day exterior of the Colosseum is in fact the original interior wall.
The surviving part of the outer wall&#x27;s monumental façade comprises three superposed storeys surmounted by a podium on which stands a tall attic, both of which are pierced by windows interspersed at regular intervals. The arcades are framed by half-columns of the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders, while the attic is decorated with Corinthian pilasters. Each of the arches in the second- and third-floor arcades framed statues, probably honoring divinities and other figures from Classical mythology.

Two hundred and forty mast corbels were positioned around the top of the attic. They originally supported a retractable awning, known as the &quot;velarium&quot;, that kept the sun and rain off spectators. This consisted of a canvas-covered, net-like structure made of ropes, with a hole in the center. It covered two-thirds of the arena, and sloped down towards the center to catch the wind and provide a breeze for the audience. Sailors, specially enlisted from the Roman naval headquarters at Misenum and housed in the nearby &quot;Castra Misenatium&quot;, were used to work the &quot;velarium&quot;.

The Colosseum&#x27;s huge crowd capacity made it essential that the venue could be filled or evacuated quickly. Its architects adopted solutions very similar to those used in modern stadia to deal with the same problem. The amphitheatre was ringed by eighty entrances at ground level, 76 of which were used by ordinary spectators. Each entrance and exit was numbered, as was each staircase. The northern main entrance was reserved for the Roman Emperor and his aides, whilst the other three axial entrances were most likely used by the elite. All four axial entrances were richly decorated with painted stucco reliefs, of which fragments survive. Many of the original outer entrances have disappeared with the collapse of the perimeter wall, but entrances XXIII (23) to LIIII (54) survive.

Spectators were given tickets in the form of numbered pottery shards, which directed them to the appropriate section and row. They accessed their seats via &quot;vomitoria&quot; (singular &quot;vomitorium&quot;), passageways that opened into a tier of seats from below or behind. These quickly dispersed people into their seats and, upon conclusion of the event or in an emergency evacuation, could permit their exit within only a few minutes. The name &quot;vomitoria&quot; derived from the Latin word for a rapid discharge, from which English derives the word vomit.

=== Interior seating ===

According to the Codex-Calendar of 354, the Colosseum could accommodate 87,000 people, although modern estimates put the figure at around 50,000. They were seated in a tiered arrangement that reflected the rigidly stratified nature of Roman society. Special boxes were provided at the north and south ends respectively for the Emperor and the Vestal Virgins, providing the best views of the arena. Flanking them at the same level was a broad platform or &quot;podium&quot; for the senatorial class, who were allowed to bring their own chairs. The names of some 5th century senators can still be seen carved into the stonework, presumably reserving areas for their use.

The tier above the senators, known as the &quot;maenianum primum&quot;, was occupied by the non-senatorial noble class or knights (&quot;equites&quot;). The next level up, the &quot;maenianum secundum&quot;, was originally reserved for ordinary Roman citizens (&quot;plebeians&quot;) and was divided into two sections. The lower part (the &quot;immum&quot;) was for wealthy citizens, while the upper part (the &quot;summum&quot;) was for poor citizens. Specific sectors were provided for other social groups: for instance, boys with their tutors, soldiers on leave, foreign dignitaries, scribes, heralds, priests and so on. Stone (and later marble) seating was provided for the citizens and nobles, who presumably would have brought their own cushions with them. Inscriptions identified the areas reserved for specific groups.

Another level, the &quot;maenianum secundum in legneis&quot;, was added at the very top of the building during the reign of Domitian. This comprised a gallery for the common poor, slaves and women. It would have been either standing room only, or would have had very steep wooden benches. Some groups were banned altogether from the Colosseum, notably gravediggers, actors and former gladiators.

Each tier was divided into sections (&quot;maeniana&quot;) by curved passages and low walls (&quot;praecinctiones&quot; or &quot;baltei&quot;), and were subdivided into &quot;cunei&quot;, or wedges, by the steps and aisles from the vomitoria. Each row (&quot;gradus&quot;) of seats was numbered, permitting each individual seat to be exactly designated by its gradus, cuneus, and number.

=== Arena and hypogeum ===

The arena itself was 83 meters by 48 meters (272 ft by 157 ft / 280 by 163 Roman feet). It comprised a wooden floor covered by sand (the Latin word for sand is &quot;harena&quot; or &quot;arena&quot;), covering an elaborate underground structure called the &quot;hypogeum&quot; (literally meaning &quot;underground&quot;). The hypogeum was not part of the original construction but was ordered to be built by Emperor Domitian. Little now remains of the original arena floor, but the &quot;hypogeum&quot; is still clearly visible. It consisted of a two-level subterranean network of tunnels and cages beneath the arena where gladiators and animals were held before contests began. Eighty vertical shafts provided instant access to the arena for caged animals and scenery pieces concealed underneath; larger hinged platforms, called &quot;hegmata&quot;, provided access for elephants and the like. It was restructured on numerous occasions; at least twelve different phases of construction can be seen.
The &quot;hypogeum&quot; was connected by tunnels to a number of points outside the Colosseum. Animals and performers were brought through the tunnel from nearby stables, with the gladiators&#x27; barracks at the Ludus Magnus to the east also being connected by tunnels. Separate tunnels were provided for the Emperor and the Vestal Virgins to permit them to enter and exit the Colosseum without needing to pass through the crowds.

Substantial quantities of machinery also existed in the &quot;hypogeum&quot;. Elevators and pulleys raised and lowered scenery and props, as well as lifting caged animals to the surface for release. There is evidence for the existence of major hydraulic mechanisms and according to ancient accounts, it was possible to flood the arena rapidly, presumably via a connection to a nearby aqueduct. However, the construction of the hypogeum at Domitian&#x27;s behest put an end to the practise of flooding, and thus also to naval battles, early in the Colosseum&#x27;s existence. There is however wide debate over the practicality and logistics of this phenomenon which leads to speculation over its actuality. This is mostly because there is no physical evidence of naumachiae at the Colosseum remains.

=== Supporting buildings ===

The Colosseum and its activities supported a substantial industry in the area. In addition to the amphitheatre itself, many other buildings nearby were linked to the games. Immediately to the east is the remains of the &quot;Ludus Magnus&quot;, a training school for gladiators. This was connected to the Colosseum by an underground passage, to allow easy access for the gladiators. The &quot;Ludus Magnus&quot; had its own miniature training arena, which was itself a popular attraction for Roman spectators. Other training schools were in the same area, including the &quot;Ludus Matutinus&quot; (Morning School), where fighters of animals were trained, plus the Dacian and Gallic Schools.

Also nearby were the &quot;Armamentarium&quot;, comprising an armory to store weapons; the &quot;Summum Choragium&quot;, where machinery was stored; the &quot;Sanitarium&quot;, which had facilities to treat wounded gladiators; and the &quot;Spoliarium&quot;, where bodies of dead gladiators were stripped of their armor and disposed of.

Around the perimeter of the Colosseum, at a distance of from the perimeter, was a series of tall stone posts, with five remaining on the eastern side. Various explanations have been advanced for their presence; they may have been a religious boundary, or an outer boundary for ticket checks, or an anchor for the &quot;velarium&quot; or awning.

== Use ==

The Colosseum was used to host gladiatorial shows as well as a variety of other events. The shows, called , were always given by private individuals rather than the state. They had a strong religious element but were also demonstrations of power and family prestige and were immensely popular. Another major attraction was the animal hunt, or &quot;venatio&quot;. This utilized a great variety of wild beasts, mainly imported from Africa and the Middle East, and included creatures such as rhinoceros, hippopotamuses, elephants, giraffes, aurochs, wisents, Barbary lions, panthers, leopards, bears, Caspian tigers, crocodiles and ostriches. Battles and hunts were often staged amid elaborate sets with movable trees and buildings. These events could be huge in scale; Trajan is said to have celebrated his victories in Dacia in 107 with contests involving 11,000 animals and 10,000 gladiators over the course of 123 days. During lunch intervals, executions &quot;ad bestias&quot; would be staged. Those condemned to death would be sent into the arena, naked and unarmed, to face the beasts of death which would literally tear them to pieces. Acrobats and magicians would also perform, usually during the intervals.

During the early days of the Colosseum, ancient writers recorded that the building was used for &quot;naumachiae&quot; (more properly known as &quot;navalia proelia&quot;) or simulated sea battles. Accounts of the inaugural games held by Titus in AD 80 describe it being filled with water for a display of specially trained swimming horses and bulls. There is also an account of a re-enactment of a famous sea battle between the Corcyrean (Corfiot) Greeks and the Corinthians. This has been the subject of some debate among historians; although providing the water would not have been a problem, it is unclear how the arena could have been waterproofed, nor would there have been enough space in the arena for the warships to move around. It has been suggested that the reports either have the location wrong or that the Colosseum originally featured a wide floodable channel down its central axis (which would later have been replaced by the hypogeum).

&quot;Sylvae&quot; or recreations of natural scenes were also held in the arena. Painters, technicians and architects would construct a simulation of a forest with real trees and bushes planted in the arena&#x27;s floor, and animals would then be introduced. Such scenes might be used simply to display a natural environment for the urban population, or could otherwise be used as the backdrop for hunts or dramas depicting episodes from mythology. They were also occasionally used for executions in which the hero of the story — played by a condemned person — was killed in one of various gruesome but mythologically authentic ways, such as being mauled by beasts or burned to death.

=== Modern use ===

Beneath the Colosseum, a network of subterranean passageways that were once used for transporting wild animals and gladiators to the arena, opened to the public in summer 2010.

The Colosseum is also the site of Roman Catholic ceremonies in the 20th and 21st centuries. For instance, Pope Benedict XVI led the Stations of the Cross called the Scriptural Way of the Cross (which calls for more meditation) at the Colosseum on Good Fridays.

====Restoration====

In 2011, Diego Della Valle, head of the shoe firm Tod&#x27;s, entered into an agreement with local officials to sponsor a €25 million restoration of the Colosseum. Work was planned to begin at the end of 2011, taking up to two and a half years. Due to the controversial nature of using a public–private partnership to fund the restoration, work was delayed and began in 2013. The restoration is the first full cleaning and repair in the Colosseum&#x27;s history. The first stage is to clean and restore the Colosseum&#x27;s arcaded façade and replace the metal enclosures that block the ground-level arches. After three years, the work was completed on 1 July 2016, when the Italian minister of culture, Dario Franceschini, also announced that the funds have been committed to replace the floors by the end of 2018. These will provide a stage that Franceschini says will be used for &quot;cultural events of the highest level.&quot; The project also includes creating a services center and restoring the galleries and underground spaces inside the Colosseum. Since 1 November 2017, the top two levels have been opened for guided visits. The fourth level held the marketplace, and the top fifth tier is where the poorest citizens, the plebeians, gathered and watched the show, bringing picnics for the day-long event.

== Significance in Christianity ==
The Colosseum is generally regarded by Christians as a site of the martyrdom of large numbers of believers during the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire, as evidenced by Church history and tradition. On the other hand, other scholars believe that the majority of martyrdoms may have occurred at other venues within the city of Rome, rather than at the Colosseum, citing a lack of still-intact physical evidence or historical records. These scholars assert that &quot;some Christians were executed as common criminals in the Colosseum—their crime being refusal to reverence the Roman gods&quot;, but most Christian martyrs of the early Church were executed for their faith at the Circus Maximus. According to Irenaeus (died about 202), Ignatius of Antioch was fed to the lions in Rome around 107 A.D. and although Irenaeus says nothing about this happening at the Colosseum, tradition ascribes it to that place.

In the Middle Ages, the Colosseum was not regarded as a monument, and was used as what some modern sources label a &quot;quarry,&quot; which is to say that stones from the Colosseum were taken for the building of other sacred sites. This fact is used to support the idea that, at a time when sites associated with martyrs were highly venerated the Colosseum was not being treated as a sacred site. It was not included in the itineraries compiled for the use of pilgrims nor in works such as the 12th century &quot;Mirabilia Urbis Romae&quot; (&quot;Marvels of the City of Rome&quot;), which claims the Circus Flaminius – but not the Colosseum – as the site of martyrdoms. Part of the structure was inhabited by a Christian religious order, but it is not known whether this was for any particular religious reason.

Pope Pius V (1566–1572) is said to have recommended that pilgrims gather sand from the arena of the Colosseum to serve as a relic, on the grounds that it was impregnated with the blood of martyrs, although some of his contemporaries did not share his conviction. A century later Fioravante Martinelli listed the Colosseum at the head of a list of places sacred to the martyrs in his 1653 book &quot;Roma ex ethnica sacra&quot;. Martinelli&#x27;s book evidently had an effect on public opinion; in response to Cardinal Altieri&#x27;s proposal some years later to turn the Colosseum into a bullring, Carlo Tomassi published a pamphlet in protest against what he regarded as an act of desecration. The ensuing controversy persuaded Pope Clement X to close the Colosseum&#x27;s external arcades and declare it a sanctuary.

At the insistence of St. Leonard of Port Maurice, Pope Benedict XIV (1740–1758) forbade the quarrying of the Colosseum and erected Stations of the Cross around the arena, which remained until February 1874. Benedict Joseph Labre spent the later years of his life within the walls of the Colosseum, living on alms, before he died in 1783. Several 19th century popes funded repair and restoration work on the Colosseum, and it still retains its Christian connection today. A Christian cross stands in the Colosseum, with a plaque, stating:

The amphitheater, one consecrated to triumphs, entertainments, and the impious worship of pagan gods, is now dedicated to the sufferings of the martyrs purified from impious superstitions.
Other Christian crosses stand in several points around the arena and every Good Friday the Pope leads a Via Crucis procession to the amphitheater.

== Flora ==

The Colosseum has a wide and well-documented history of flora ever since Domenico Panaroli made the first catalogue of its plants in 1643. Since then, 684 species have been identified there. The peak was in 1855 (420 species). Attempts were made in 1871 to eradicate the vegetation, because of concerns over the damage that was being caused to the masonry, but much of it has returned. Two hundred forty-two species have been counted today and of the species first identified by Panaroli, 200 remain.

The variation of plants can be explained by the change of climate in Rome through the centuries. Additionally, bird migration, flower blooming, and the growth of Rome that caused the Colosseum to become embedded within the modern city centre rather than on the outskirts of the ancient city, as well as deliberate transport of species, are also contributing causes. Another reason often given is their seeds being unwittingly transported either on the fur or in the feces of animals brought there from all corners of the empire.

== In popular culture ==
The Colosseum has appeared in numerous films, artworks and games. It is featured in films such as &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;, &quot;Gladiator&quot;, &quot;The Way of the Dragon&quot;, &quot;Jumper,&quot; and &quot;Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire&quot;.

Several architectural works have also been modelled on or inspired by, the Colosseum. These include:
* The &quot;Kongresshalle&quot;, or &quot;Congress Hall&quot;, (1935, unfinished) at the Nazi Party Rally grounds, Nuremberg, Germany
* The Summer Olympic Games medal from 1928 to 2000, designed by Giuseppe Cassioli, features a depiction of the Colosseum. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens the Colosseum was replaced by a depiction of the Panathinaiko Stadium
* The exterior of the Vancouver Public Library in British Columbia resembles the current state of the Colosseum. It was designed by Moshe Safdie.
* The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum entrance was inspired by the Colosseum.
* The Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana was very closely modelled on the Colosseum. It was built for Mussolini for the Universal Exhibition of 1942 but the exhibition never happened due to the outbreak of World War II. The architects were Giovanni Guerrini, Ernesto Bruno La Padula, and Mario Romano.
* McCaig&#x27;s Tower, overlooking Oban, Scotland.

<text>Hearing loss is a partial or total inability to hear. Hearing loss may be present at birth or acquired at any time afterwards. Hearing loss may occur in one or both ears. In children, hearing problems can affect the ability to acquire spoken language, and in adults it can create difficulties with social interaction and at work. Hearing loss can be temporary or permanent. Hearing loss related to age usually affects both ears and is due to cochlear hair cell loss. In some people, particularly older people, hearing loss can result in loneliness.
Hearing loss may be caused by a number of factors, including: genetics, ageing, exposure to noise, some infections, birth complications, trauma to the ear, and certain medications or toxins. A common condition that results in hearing loss is chronic ear infections. Certain infections during pregnancy, such as cytomegalovirus, syphilis and rubella, may also cause hearing loss in the child. Hearing loss is diagnosed when hearing testing finds that a person is unable to hear 25 decibels in at least one ear. Testing for poor hearing is recommended for all newborns. Hearing loss can be categorized as mild (25 to 40 dB), moderate (41 to 55 dB), moderate-severe (56 to 70 dB), severe (71 to 90 dB), or profound (greater than 90 dB). There are three main types of hearing loss: conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss.
About half of hearing loss globally is preventable through public health measures. Such practices include immunization, proper care around pregnancy, avoiding loud noise, and avoiding certain medications. The World Health Organization recommends that young people limit exposure to loud sounds and the use of personal audio players to an hour a day in an effort to limit exposure to noise. Early identification and support are particularly important in children. For many, hearing aids, sign language, cochlear implants and subtitles are useful. Lip reading is another useful skill some develop. Access to hearing aids, however, is limited in many areas of the world.
As of 2013 hearing loss affects about 1.1 billion people to some degree. It causes disability in about 466 million people (5% of the global population), and moderate to severe disability in 124 million people. Of those with moderate to severe disability 108 million live in low and middle income countries. Of those with hearing loss, it began during childhood for 65 million. Those who use sign language and are members of Deaf culture may see themselves as having a difference rather than a disability. Many members of Deaf culture oppose attempts to cure deafness and some within this community view cochlear implants with concern as they have the potential to eliminate their culture.

==Definition==

* Hearing loss is defined as diminished acuity to sounds which would otherwise be heard normally. The terms hearing impaired or hard of hearing are usually reserved for people who have relative inability to hear sound in the speech frequencies. Hearing loss occurs when sound waves enter the ears and damage the sensitive tissues The severity of hearing loss is categorized according to the increase in intensity of sound above the usual level required for the listener to detect it.
* Deafness is defined as a degree of loss such that a person is unable to understand speech, even in the presence of amplification. In profound deafness, even the highest intensity sounds produced by an audiometer (an instrument used to measure hearing by producing pure tone sounds through a range of frequencies) may not be detected. In total deafness, no sounds at all, regardless of amplification or method of production, can be heard.
* Speech perception is another aspect of hearing which involves the perceived clarity of a word rather than the intensity of sound made by the word. In humans, this is usually measured with speech discrimination tests, which measure not only the ability to detect sound, but also the ability to understand speech. There are very rare types of hearing loss that affect speech discrimination alone. One example is auditory neuropathy, a variety of hearing loss in which the outer hair cells of the cochlea are intact and functioning, but sound information is not faithfully transmitted by the auditory nerve to the brain.

Use of the terms &quot;hearing impaired&quot;, &quot;deaf-mute&quot;, or &quot;deaf and dumb&quot; to describe deaf and hard of hearing people is discouraged by many in the deaf community as well as advocacy organizations, as they are offensive to many deaf and hard of hearing people.

===Hearing standards===

Human hearing extends in frequency from 20 to 20,000 Hz, and in intensity from 0 dB to 120 dB HL or more. 0 dB does not represent absence of sound, but rather the softest sound an average unimpaired human ear can hear; some people can hear down to −5 or even −10 dB. Sound is generally uncomfortably loud above 90 dB and 115 dB represents the threshold of pain. The ear does not hear all frequencies equally well: hearing sensitivity peaks around 3,000 Hz. There are many qualities of human hearing besides frequency range and intensity that cannot easily be measured quantitatively. However, for many practical purposes, normal hearing is defined by a frequency versus intensity graph, or audiogram, charting sensitivity thresholds of hearing at defined frequencies. Because of the cumulative impact of age and exposure to noise and other acoustic insults, &#x27;typical&#x27; hearing may not be normal.

==Signs and symptoms==
The presentation is as follows:
* difficulty using the telephone
* loss of sound localization
* difficulty understanding speech, especially of children and women whose voices are of a higher frequency.
* difficulty understanding speech in the presence of background noise (cocktail party effect)
* sounds or speech sounding dull, muffled or attenuated
* need for increased volume on television, radio, music and other audio sources

Hearing loss is sensory, but may have accompanying symptoms:
* pain or pressure in the ears
* a blocked feeling

There may also be accompanying secondary symptoms:
* hyperacusis, heightened sensitivity with accompanying auditory pain to certain intensities and frequencies of sound, sometimes defined as &quot;auditory recruitment&quot;
* tinnitus, ringing, buzzing, hissing or other sounds in the ear when no external sound is present
* vertigo and disequilibrium
* tympanophonia, also known as autophonia, abnormal hearing of one&#x27;s own voice and respiratory sounds, usually as a result of a patulous (a constantly open) eustachian tube or dehiscent superior semicircular canals
* disturbances of facial movement (indicating a possible tumour or stroke) or in persons with Bell&#x27;s palsy

=== Complications ===
Hearing loss is associated with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and dementia. The risk increases with the hearing loss degree. A systematic review and meta analysis assessed the link between hearing loss and dementia subtypes. Hearing loss was linked to an increased risk of mild to severe cognitive problems, including mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease. Hearing loss was not linked to an increased risk of vascular dementia. There are several hypotheses including cognitive resources being redistributed to hearing and social isolation from hearing loss having a negative effect. According to preliminary data, hearing aid usage can slow down the decline in cognitive functions.

Hearing loss is responsible for causing thalamocortical dysrthymia in the brain which is a cause for several neurological disorders including tinnitus and visual snow syndrome.

==== Cognitive decline ====
Hearing loss is an increasing concern especially in aging populations. The prevalence of hearing loss increases about two-fold for each decade increase in age after age 40. While the secular trend might decrease individual level risk of developing hearing loss, the prevalence of hearing loss is expected to rise due to the aging population in the US. Another concern about aging process is cognitive decline, which may progress to mild cognitive impairment and eventually dementia. The association between hearing loss and cognitive decline has been studied in various research settings. Despite the variability in study design and protocols, the majority of these studies have found consistent association between age-related hearing loss and cognitive decline, cognitive impairment, and dementia. The association between age-related hearing loss and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease was found to be nonsignificant, and this finding supports the hypothesis that hearing loss is associated with dementia independent of Alzheimer pathology. There are several hypotheses about the underlying causal mechanism for age-related hearing loss and cognitive decline. One hypothesis is that this association can be explained by common etiology or shared neurobiological pathology with decline in other physiological system. Another possible cognitive mechanism emphasize on individual&#x27;s cognitive load. As people developing hearing loss in the process of aging, the cognitive load demanded by auditory perception increases, which may lead to change in brain structure and eventually to dementia. One other hypothesis suggests that the association between hearing loss and cognitive decline is mediated through various psychosocial factors, such as decrease in social contact and increase in social isolation. Findings on the association between hearing loss and dementia have significant public health implication, since about 9% of dementia cases are associated with hearing loss.

==== Falls ====
People with hearing loss are at a higher risk of falling. There is also a potential dose–response relationship between hearing loss and falls—greater severity of hearing loss is associated with increased difficulties in postural control and increased prevalence of falls. The underlying causal link between the association of hearing loss and falls is yet to be elucidated. There are several hypotheses that indicate that there may be a common process between decline in auditory system and increase in incident falls, driven by physiological, cognitive, and behavioral factors. This evidence suggests that treating hearing loss has potential to increase health-related quality of life in older adults.Falls have important health implications, especially for an aging population where they can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Elderly people are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of injuries caused by falls, since older individuals typically have greater bone fragility and poorer protective reflexes. Fall-related injury can also lead to burdens on the financial and health care systems. In literature, age-related hearing loss is found to be significantly associated with incident falls. 

==== Depression ====
Hearing loss can contribute to decrease in health-related quality of life, increase in social isolation and decline in social engagement, which are all risk factors for increased risk of developing depression symptoms. Depression is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In older adults, the suicide rate is higher than it is for younger adults, and more suicide cases are attributable to depression. Some chronic diseases are found to be significantly associated with risk of developing depression, such as coronary heart disease, pulmonary disease, vision loss and hearing loss. 

==== Spoken language ability ====
Prelingual deafness is profound hearing loss that is sustained before the acquisition of language, which can occur due to a congenital condition or through hearing loss before birth or in early infancy. Prelingual deafness impairs an individual&#x27;s ability to acquire a &quot;spoken&quot; language in children, but deaf children can acquire spoken language through support from cochlear implants (sometimes combined with hearing aids). Non-signing (hearing) parents of deaf babies (90–95% of cases) usually go with oral approach without the support of sign language, as these families lack previous experience with sign language and cannot competently provide it to their children without learning it themselves. This may in some cases (late implantation or not sufficient benefit from cochlear implants) bring the risk of language deprivation for the deaf baby because the deaf baby would not have a sign language if the child is unable to acquire spoken language successfully. The 5–10% of cases of deaf babies born into signing families have the potential of age-appropriate development of language due to early exposure to a &quot;sign language&quot; by sign-competent parents, thus they have the potential to meet language milestones, in sign language in lieu of spoken language.

Post-lingual deafness is hearing loss that is sustained after the acquisition of language, which can occur due to disease, trauma, or as a side-effect of a medicine. Typically, hearing loss is gradual and often detected by family and friends of affected individuals long before the patients themselves will acknowledge the disability. Post-lingual deafness is far more common than pre-lingual deafness. Those who lose their hearing later in life, such as in late adolescence or adulthood, face their own challenges, living with the adaptations that allow them to live independently.

==Causes==

Hearing loss has multiple causes, including ageing, genetics, perinatal problems and acquired causes like noise and disease. For some kinds of hearing loss the cause may be classified as of unknown cause.

There is a progressive loss of ability to hear high frequencies with aging known as presbycusis. For men, this can start as early as 25 and women at 30. Although genetically variable, it is a normal concomitant of ageing and is distinct from hearing losses caused by noise exposure, toxins or disease agents. Common conditions that can increase the risk of hearing loss in elderly people are high blood pressure, diabetes (hearing loss in diabetes), or the use of certain medications harmful to the ear. While everyone loses hearing with age, the amount and type of hearing loss is variable.

Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), also known as acoustic trauma, typically manifests as elevated hearing thresholds (i.e. less sensitivity or muting). Noise exposure is the cause of approximately half of all cases of hearing loss, causing some degree of problems in 5% of the population globally. The majority of hearing loss is not due to age, but due to noise exposure. Various governmental, industry and standards organizations set noise standards. Many people are unaware of the presence of environmental sound at damaging levels, or of the level at which sound becomes harmful. Common sources of damaging noise levels include car stereos, children&#x27;s toys, motor vehicles, crowds, lawn and maintenance equipment, power tools, gun use, musical instruments, and even hair dryers. Noise damage is cumulative; all sources of damage must be considered to assess risk. In the US, 12.5% of children aged 6–19 years have permanent hearing damage from excessive noise exposure. The World Health Organization estimates that half of those between 12 and 35 are at risk from using personal audio devices that are too loud. Hearing loss in adolescents may be caused by loud noise from toys, music by headphones, and concerts or events.

Hearing loss can be inherited. Around 75–80% of all these cases are inherited by recessive genes, 20–25% are inherited by dominant genes, 1–2% are inherited by X-linked patterns, and fewer than 1% are inherited by mitochondrial inheritance. Syndromic deafness occurs when there are other signs or medical problems aside from deafness in an individual, such as Usher syndrome, Stickler syndrome, Waardenburg syndrome, Alport&#x27;s syndrome, and neurofibromatosis type 2. Nonsyndromic deafness occurs when there are no other signs or medical problems associated with the deafness in an individual.

Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are reported to cause hearing loss in up to 64% of infants born to alcoholic mothers, from the ototoxic effect on the developing fetus plus malnutrition during pregnancy from the excess alcohol intake. Premature birth can be associated with sensorineural hearing loss because of an increased risk of hypoxia, hyperbilirubinaemia, ototoxic medication and infection as well as noise exposure in the neonatal units. Also, hearing loss in premature babies is often discovered far later than a similar hearing loss would be in a full-term baby because normally babies are given a hearing test within 48 hours of birth, but doctors must wait until the premature baby is medically stable before testing hearing, which can be months after birth. The risk of hearing loss is greatest for those weighing less than 1500 g at birth.

Disorders responsible for hearing loss include auditory neuropathy, Down syndrome, Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease variant 1E, autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis, meningitis, cholesteatoma, otosclerosis, perilymph fistula, Ménière&#x27;s disease, recurring ear infections, strokes, superior semicircular canal dehiscence, Pierre Robin, Treacher-Collins, Usher Syndrome, Pendred Syndrome, and Turner syndrome, syphilis, vestibular schwannoma, and viral infections such as measles, mumps, congenital rubella (also called German measles) syndrome, several varieties of herpes viruses, HIV/AIDS, and West Nile virus.

Some medications may reversibly or irreversibly affect hearing. These medications are considered ototoxic. This includes loop diuretics such as furosemide and bumetanide, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) both over-the-counter (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen) as well as prescription (celecoxib, diclofenac, etc.), paracetamol, quinine, and macrolide antibiotics. Others may cause permanent hearing loss. The most important group is the aminoglycosides (main member gentamicin) and platinum based chemotherapeutics such as cisplatin and carboplatin.

In addition to medications, hearing loss can also result from specific chemicals in the environment: metals, such as lead; solvents, such as toluene (found in crude oil, gasoline and automobile exhaust, for example); and asphyxiants. Combined with noise, these ototoxic chemicals have an additive effect on a person&#x27;s hearing loss. Hearing loss due to chemicals starts in the high frequency range and is irreversible. It damages the cochlea with lesions and degrades central portions of the auditory system. For some ototoxic chemical exposures, particularly styrene, the risk of hearing loss can be higher than being exposed to noise alone. The effects is greatest when the combined exposure include impulse noise. A 2018 informational bulletin by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) introduces the issue, provides examples of ototoxic chemicals, lists the industries and occupations at risk and provides prevention information.

There can be damage either to the ear, whether the external or middle ear, to the cochlea, or to the brain centers that process the aural information conveyed by the ears. Damage to the middle ear may include fracture and discontinuity of the ossicular chain. Damage to the inner ear (cochlea) may be caused by temporal bone fracture. People who sustain head injury are especially vulnerable to hearing loss or tinnitus, either temporary or permanent.

==Pathophysiology==

Sound waves reach the outer ear and are conducted down the ear canal to the eardrum, causing it to vibrate. The vibrations are transferred by the 3 tiny ear bones of the middle ear to the fluid in the inner ear. The fluid moves hair cells (stereocilia), and their movement generates nerve impulses which are then taken to the brain by the cochlear nerve. The auditory nerve takes the impulses to the brainstem, which sends the impulses to the midbrain. Finally, the signal goes to the auditory cortex of the temporal lobe to be interpreted as sound.

Hearing loss is most commonly caused by long-term exposure to loud noises, from recreation or from work, that damage the hair cells, which do not grow back on their own.

Older people may lose their hearing from long exposure to noise, changes in the inner ear, changes in the middle ear, or from changes along the nerves from the ear to the brain.

==Diagnosis==

Identification of a hearing loss is usually conducted by a general practitioner medical doctor, otolaryngologist, certified and licensed audiologist, school or industrial audiometrist, or other audiometric technician. Diagnosis of the cause of a hearing loss is carried out by a specialist physician (audiovestibular physician) or otorhinolaryngologist.

Hearing loss is generally measured by playing generated or recorded sounds, and determining whether the person can hear them. Hearing sensitivity varies according to the frequency of sounds. To take this into account, hearing sensitivity can be measured for a range of frequencies and plotted on an audiogram. Other method for quantifying hearing loss is a hearing test using a mobile application or hearing aid application, which includes a hearing test. Hearing diagnosis using mobile application is similar to the audiometry procedure. Audiograms, obtained using mobile applications, can be used to adjust hearing aid applications. Another method for quantifying hearing loss is a speech-in-noise test. which gives an indication of how well one can understand speech in a noisy environment. Otoacoustic emissions test is an objective hearing test that may be administered to toddlers and children too young to cooperate in a conventional hearing test. Auditory brainstem response testing is an electrophysiological test used to test for hearing deficits caused by pathology within the ear, the cochlear nerve and also within the brainstem.

A case history (usually a written form, with questionnaire) can provide valuable information about the context of the hearing loss, and indicate what kind of diagnostic procedures to employ. Examinations include otoscopy, tympanometry, and differential testing with the Weber, Rinne, Bing and Schwabach tests. In case of infection or inflammation, blood or other body fluids may be submitted for laboratory analysis. MRI and CT scans can be useful to identify the pathology of many causes of hearing loss.

Hearing loss is categorized by severity, type, and configuration. Furthermore, a hearing loss may exist in only one ear (unilateral) or in both ears (bilateral). Hearing loss can be temporary or permanent, sudden or progressive. The &quot;severity&quot; of a hearing loss is ranked according to ranges of nominal thresholds in which a sound must be so it can be detected by an individual. It is measured in decibels of hearing loss, or dB HL. There are three main &quot;types&quot; of hearing loss: conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. An additional problem which is increasingly recognised is auditory processing disorder which is not a hearing loss as such but a difficulty perceiving sound. The shape of an audiogram shows the relative &quot;configuration&quot; of the hearing loss, such as a Carhart notch for otosclerosis, &#x27;noise&#x27; notch for noise-induced damage, high frequency rolloff for presbycusis, or a flat audiogram for conductive hearing loss. In conjunction with speech audiometry, it may indicate central auditory processing disorder, or the presence of a schwannoma or other tumor.

People with unilateral hearing loss or single-sided deafness (SSD) have difficulty in hearing conversation on their impaired side, localizing sound, and understanding speech in the presence of background noise. One reason for the hearing problems these patients often experience is due to the head shadow effect.

Idiopathic sudden hearing loss is a condition where a person as an immediate decrease in the sensitivity of their sensorineural hearing that does not have a known cause. This type of loss is usually only on one side (unilateral) and the severity of the loss varies. A common threshold of a &quot;loss of at least 30 dB in three connected frequencies within 72 hours&quot; is sometimes used, however there is no universal definition or international consensus for diagnosing idiopathic sudden hearing loss.

==Prevention==
It is estimated that half of cases of hearing loss are preventable. About 60% of hearing loss in children under the age of 15 can be avoided. There are a number of effective preventative strategies, including: immunization against rubella to prevent congenital rubella syndrome, immunization against &quot;H. influenza&quot; and &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; to reduce cases of meningitis, and avoiding or protecting against excessive noise exposure. The World Health Organization also recommends immunization against measles, mumps, and meningitis, efforts to prevent premature birth, and avoidance of certain medication as prevention. World Hearing Day is a yearly event to promote actions to prevent hearing damage.

Avoiding exposure to loud noise can help prevent noise-induced hearing loss. 18% of adults exposed to loud noise at work for five years or more report hearing loss in both ears as compared to 5.5% of adults who were not exposed to loud noise at work. Different programs exist for specific populations such as school-age children, adolescents and workers. But the HPD (without individual selection, training and fit testing) does not significantly reduce the risk of hearing loss. The use of antioxidants is being studied for the prevention of noise-induced hearing loss, particularly for scenarios in which noise exposure cannot be reduced, such as during military operations.

===Workplace noise regulation===
Noise is widely recognized as an occupational hazard. In the United States, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) work together to provide standards and enforcement on workplace noise levels. The hierarchy of hazard controls demonstrates the different levels of controls to reduce or eliminate exposure to noise and prevent hearing loss, including engineering controls and personal protective equipment (PPE). Other programs and initiative have been created to prevent hearing loss in the workplace. For example, the Safe-in-Sound Award was created to recognize organizations that can demonstrate results of successful noise control and other interventions. Additionally, the Buy Quiet program was created to encourage employers to purchase quieter machinery and tools. By purchasing less noisy power tools like those found on the NIOSH Power Tools Database and limiting exposure to ototoxic chemicals, great strides can be made in preventing hearing loss.

Companies can also provide personal hearing protector devices tailored to both the worker and type of employment. Some hearing protectors universally block out all noise, and some allow for certain noises to be heard. Workers are more likely to wear hearing protector devices when they are properly fitted.

Often interventions to prevent noise-induced hearing loss have many components. A 2017 Cochrane review found that stricter legislation might reduce noise levels. Providing workers with information on their sound exposure levels was not shown to decrease exposure to noise. Ear protection, if used correctly, can reduce noise to safer levels, but often, providing them is not sufficient to prevent hearing loss. Engineering noise out and other solutions such as proper maintenance of equipment can lead to noise reduction, but further field studies on resulting noise exposures following such interventions are needed. Other possible solutions include improved enforcement of existing legislation and better implementation of well-designed prevention programmes, which have not yet been proven conclusively to be effective. The conclusion of the Cochrane Review was that further research could modify what is now regarding the effectiveness of the evaluated interventions.

The Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German Social Accident Insurance has created a hearing impairment calculator based on the ISO 1999 model for studying threshold shift in relatively homogeneous groups of people, such as workers with the same type of job. The ISO 1999 model estimates how much hearing impairment in a group can be ascribed to age and noise exposure. The result is calculated via an algebraic equation that uses the A-weighted sound exposure level, how many years the people were exposed to this noise, how old the people are, and their sex. The model&#x27;s estimations are only useful for people without hearing loss due to non-job related exposure and can be used for prevention activities.

===Screening===
The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends neonatal hearing screening for all newborns, as the first three years of life are believed to be the most important for language development. Universal neonatal hearing screenings have now been widely implemented across the U.S., with rates of newborn screening increasing from less than 3% in the early 1990s to 98% in 2009. Newborns whose screening reveals a high index of suspicion of hearing loss are referred for additional diagnostic testing with the goal of providing early intervention and access to language.

The American Academy of Pediatrics advises that children should have their hearing tested several times throughout their schooling:
* When they enter school
* At ages 6, 8, and 10
* At least once during middle school
* At least once during high school
While the American College of Physicians indicated that there is not enough evidence to determine the utility of screening in adults over 50 years old who do not have any symptoms, the American Language, Speech Pathology and Hearing Association recommends that adults should be screened at least every decade through age 50 and at three-year intervals thereafter, to minimize the detrimental effects of the untreated condition on quality of life. For the same reason, the US Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion included as one of Healthy People 2020 objectives: to increase the proportion of persons who have had a hearing examination.

==Management==
Management depends on the specific cause if known as well as the extent, type and configuration of the hearing loss. Sudden hearing loss due to an underlying nerve problem may be treated with corticosteroids.

Most hearing loss, that result from age and noise, is progressive and irreversible, and there are currently no approved or recommended treatments. A few specific kinds of hearing loss are amenable to surgical treatment. In other cases, treatment is addressed to underlying pathologies, but any hearing loss incurred may be permanent. Some management options include hearing aids, cochlear implants, middle ear implants, assistive technology, and closed captioning; in movie theaters, a Hearing Impaired (HI) audio track may be available via headphones to better hear dialog.

This choice depends on the level of hearing loss, type of hearing loss, and personal preference. Hearing aid applications are one of the options for hearing loss management. For people with bilateral hearing loss, it is not clear if bilateral hearing aids (hearing aids in both ears) are better than a unilateral hearing aid (hearing aid in one ear).

=== Idiopathic sudden hearing loss ===
For people with idiopathic sudden hearing loss, different treatment approaches have been suggested that are usually based on the suspected cause of the sudden hearing loss. Treatment approaches may include corticosteroid medications, rheological drugs, vasodilators, anesthetics, and other medications chosen based on the suspected underlying pathology that caused the sudden hearing loss. The evidence supporting most treatment options for idiopathic sudden hearing loss is very weak and adverse effects of these different medications is a consideration when deciding on a treatment approach.

==Epidemiology==
Globally, hearing loss affects about 10% of the population to some degree. It caused moderate to severe disability in 124.2 million people as of 2004 (107.9 million of whom are in low and middle income countries). Of these 65 million acquired the condition during childhood. At birth ~3 per 1000 in developed countries and more than 6 per 1000 in developing countries have hearing problems.

Hearing loss increases with age. In those between 20 and 35 rates of hearing loss are 3% while in those 44 to 55 it is 11% and in those 65 to 85 it is 43%.

A 2017 report by the World Health Organization estimated the costs of unaddressed hearing loss and the cost-effectiveness of interventions, for the health-care sector, for the education sector and as broad societal costs. Globally, the annual cost of unaddressed hearing loss was estimated to be in the range of $750–790 billion international dollars.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed the ISO 1999 standards for the estimation of hearing thresholds and noise-induced hearing impairment. They used data from two noise and hearing study databases, one presented by Burns and Robinson (&quot;Hearing and Noise in Industry,&quot; Her Majesty&#x27;s Stationery Office, London, 1970) and by Passchier-Vermeer (1968). As race are some of the factors that can affect the expected distribution of pure-tone hearing thresholds several other national or regional datasets exist, from Sweden, Norway, South Korea, the United States and Spain.

In the United States hearing is one of the health outcomes measure by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a survey research program conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics. It examines health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. Data from the United States in 2011–2012 found that rates of hearing loss has declined among adults aged 20 to 69 years, when compared with the results from an earlier time period (1999–2004). It also found that adult hearing loss is associated with increasing age, sex, ethnicity, educational level, and noise exposure. Nearly one in four adults had audiometric results suggesting noise-induced hearing loss. Almost one in four adults who reported excellent or good hearing had a similar pattern (5.5% on both sides and 18% on one side). Among people who reported exposure to loud noise at work, almost one third had such changes.

==Social and cultural aspects==
People with extreme hearing loss may communicate through sign languages. Sign languages convey meaning through manual communication and body language instead of acoustically conveyed sound patterns. This involves the simultaneous combination of hand shapes, orientation and movement of the hands, arms or body, and facial expressions to express a speaker&#x27;s thoughts. &quot;Sign languages are based on the idea that vision is the most useful tool a deaf person has to communicate and receive information&quot;.

Deaf culture refers to a tight-knit cultural group of people whose primary language is signed, and who practice social and cultural norms which are distinct from those of the surrounding hearing community. This community does not automatically include all those who are clinically or legally deaf, nor does it exclude every hearing person. According to Baker and Padden, it includes any person or persons who &quot;identifies him/herself as a member of the Deaf community, and other members accept that person as a part of the community,&quot; an example being children of deaf adults with normal hearing ability. It includes the set of social beliefs, behaviors, art, literary traditions, history, values, and shared institutions of communities that are influenced by deafness and which use sign languages as the main means of communication. Members of the Deaf community tend to view deafness as a difference in human experience rather than a disability or disease. When used as a cultural label especially within the culture, the word &quot;deaf&quot; is often written with a capital &quot;D&quot; and referred to as &quot;big D Deaf&quot; in speech and sign. When used as a label for the audiological condition, it is written with a lower case &quot;d&quot;.

There also multiple educational institutions for both deaf and Deaf people, that usually use sign language as the main language of instruction. Famous institutions include Gallaudet University and the National Technical Institute for the Deaf in the US, and the National University Corporation of Tsukuba University of Technology in Japan.

== Research ==

===Stem cell transplant and gene therapy===
A 2005 study achieved successful regrowth of cochlea cells in guinea pigs. However, the regrowth of cochlear hair cells does not imply the restoration of hearing sensitivity, as the sensory cells may or may not make connections with neurons that carry the signals from hair cells to the brain. A 2008 study has shown that gene therapy targeting Atoh1 can cause hair cell growth and attract neuronal processes in embryonic mice. Some hope that a similar treatment will one day ameliorate hearing loss in humans.

Recent research reported in 2012 achieved growth of cochlear nerve cells resulting in hearing improvements in gerbils by using stem cells. Also reported in 2013 was regrowth of hair cells in deaf adult mice using a drug intervention resulting in hearing improvement. The Hearing Health Foundation in the US has embarked on a project called the Hearing Restoration Project. Also Action on Hearing Loss in the UK is also aiming to restore hearing.

Researchers reported in 2015 that genetically deaf mice which were treated with TMC1 gene therapy recovered some of their hearing. In 2017, additional studies were performed to treat Usher syndrome and here, a recombinant adeno-associated virus seemed to outperform the older vectors.

===Audition===
Besides research studies seeking to improve hearing, such as the ones listed above, research studies on the deaf have also been carried out in order to understand more about audition. Pijil and Shwarz (2005) conducted their study on the deaf who lost their hearing later in life and, hence, used cochlear implants to hear. They discovered further evidence for rate coding of pitch, a system that codes for information for frequencies by the rate that neurons fire in the auditory system, especially for lower frequencies as they are coded by the frequencies that neurons fire from the basilar membrane in a synchronous manner. Their results showed that the subjects could identify different pitches that were proportional to the frequency stimulated by a single electrode. The lower frequencies were detected when the basilar membrane was stimulated, providing even further evidence for rate coding.

<text>Jargon, or technical language, is the specialized terminology associated with a particular field or area of activity. Jargon is normally employed in a particular communicative context and may not be well understood outside that context. The context is usually a particular occupation (that is, a certain trade, profession, vernacular or academic field), but any ingroup can have jargon. The key characteristic that distinguishes jargon from the rest of a language is its specialized vocabulary, which includes terms and definitions of words that are unique to the context, and terms used in a narrower and more exact sense than when used in colloquial language. This can lead outgroups to misunderstand communication attempts. Jargon is sometimes understood as a form of technical slang and then distinguished from the official terminology used in a particular field of activity.

The terms &quot;jargon&quot;, &quot;slang,&quot; and &quot;argot&quot; are not consistently differentiated in the literature; different authors interpret these concepts in varying ways. According to one definition, jargon differs from slang in being secretive in nature; according to another understanding, it is specifically associated with professional and technical circles. Some sources, however, treat these terms as synonymous. The use of jargon became more popular around the sixteenth century attracting persons from different career paths. This led to there being printed copies available on the various forms of jargon.

==Specifics==
Jargon, also referred to as &quot;technical language&quot;, is &quot;the technical terminology or characteristic idiom of a special activity or group&quot;. Most jargon is &quot;technical terminology&quot; (&quot;technical terms&quot;), involving &quot;terms of art&quot; or &quot;industry terms&quot;, with particular meaning within a specific industry. The primary driving forces in the creation of technical jargon are precision, efficiency of communication, and professionalism. Terms and phrases that are considered jargon have meaningful definitions, and through frequency of use, can become .

While jargon allows greater efficiency in communication among those familiar with it, a side effect is that it raises the threshold of comprehensibility for outsiders. This is usually accepted as an unavoidable trade-off, but it may also be used as a means of social exclusion (reinforcing ingroup–outgroup barriers) or social aspiration (when introduced as a way of demonstrating expertise). Some academics promote the use of jargon-free language, or plain language, as an audience may be alienated or confused by the technical terminology, and thus lose track of a speaker or writer&#x27;s broader and more important arguments.

Some words with both a technical and a non-technical meaning are referred to as semi-technical vocabulary: for example, Chinh Ngan Nguyen Le and Julia Miller refer to &quot;colon&quot; as an anatomical term and also a punctuation mark; and Derek Matravers refers to &quot;person&quot; and its plural form &quot;persons&quot; as technical language used in philosophy, where their meaning is more specific than &quot;person&quot; and &quot;people&quot; in their everyday use.

==Etymology==
The French word is believed to have been derived from the Latin word , meaning &quot;to chatter&quot;, which was used to describe speech that the listener did not understand. The word may also come from Old French meaning &quot;chatter of birds&quot;. Middle English also has the verb meaning &quot;to chatter&quot;, or &quot;twittering&quot;, deriving from Old French.
The first known use of the word in English is found within &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, written by Geoffrey Chaucer between 1387 and 1400. Chaucer related &quot;jargon&quot; to the vocalizations of birds.

In colonial history, jargon was seen as a device of communication to bridge the gap between two speakers who did not speak the same tongue. Jargon was synonymous with pidgin in naming specific language usages. Jargon then began to have a negative connotation with lacking coherent grammar, or gibberish as it was seen as a &quot;broken&quot; language of many different languages with no full community to call their own. In the 1980s, linguists began restricting this usage of jargon to keep the word to more commonly define a technical or specialized language use.

===Fields using the term===
In linguistics, it is used to mean &quot;specialist language&quot;, with the term also seen as closely related to slang, argot and cant. Various kinds of language peculiar to ingroups can be named across a semantic field. Slang can be either culture-wide or known only within a certain group or subculture. Argot is slang or jargon purposely used to obscure meaning to outsiders. Conversely, a lingua franca is used for the opposite effect, helping communicators to overcome unintelligibility, as are pidgins and creole languages. For example, the Chinook Jargon was a pidgin. Although technical jargon&#x27;s primary purpose is to aid technical communication, not to exclude outsiders by serving as an argot, it can have both effects at once and can provide a technical ingroup with shibboleths. For example, medieval guilds could use this as one means of informal protectionism. On the other hand, jargon that once was obscure outside a small ingroup can become generally known over time. For example, the terms &quot;bit, byte,&quot; and &quot;hexadecimal&quot; (which are terms from computing jargon) are now recognized by many people outside computer science.

===Referenced===
The philosopher Étienne Bonnot de Condillac observed in 1782 that &quot;every science requires a special language because every science has its own ideas&quot;. As a rationalist member of the Enlightenment, he continued: &quot;It seems that one ought to begin by composing this language, but people begin by speaking and writing, and the language remains to be composed.&quot;

==Industry term==
An industry word is a specialized kind of technical terminology used in a certain industry. Industry words and phrases are often used in a specific area, and those in that field know and use the terminology.

Precise technical terms and their definitions are formally recognized, documented, and taught by educators in the field. Other terms are more colloquial, coined and used by practitioners in the field, and are similar to slang. The boundaries between formal and slang jargon, as in general English, are quite fluid. This is especially true in the rapidly developing world of computers and networking. For instance, the term &quot;firewall&quot; (in the sense of a device used to filter network traffic) was at first technical slang. As these devices became more widespread and the term became widely understood, the word was adopted as formal terminology.

Technical terminology evolves due to the need for experts in a field to communicate with precision and brevity but often has the effect of excluding those who are unfamiliar with the particular specialized language of the group. This can cause difficulties, for example, when a patient is unable to follow the discussions of medical practitioners, and thus cannot understand his own condition and treatment. Differences in jargon also cause difficulties where professionals in related fields use different terms for the same phenomena.

=== Corporate jargon ===
The use of jargon in the business world is a common occurrence. The use of jargon in business correspondence reached a high popularity between the late 1800s into the 1950s. In this context, jargon is most frequently used in modes of communication such as emails, reports, and other forms of documentation. Common phrases used in corporate jargon include:

* Common share
* Dividend
* KPI (Key Performance Indicator)
* Pursuant
* ROI (Return on Investment)
* SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) 
* Undersigned

=== Medical jargon ===
Medicine professionals make extensive use of scientific terminology. Most patients encounter medical jargon when referring to their diagnosis or when receiving or reading their medication. Some commonly used terms in medical jargon are:

* Code blue
* Dyspnea
* Hematoma
* Hypertension
* Palliative care
* Tachycardia

At first glance, many people do not understand what these terms mean and may panic when they see these scientific names being used in reference to their health. The argument as to whether medical jargon is a positive or negative attribute of a patient&#x27;s experience has evidence to support both sides. On one hand, as mentioned before, these phrases can be overwhelming for some patients who may not understand the terminology. However, with the accessibility of the internet, it has been suggested that these terms can be used and easily researched for clarity.

=== Legal jargon ===
Jargon is commonly found in the field of law. These terms are often used in legal contexts such as legal documents, court proceedings, contracts, and more. Some common terms in this profession include:

* Acquittal
* Affidavit
* Adjudication
* Libel
* Litigation
* Tort

=== Education jargon ===
There is specialized terminology within the field of education. Educators and administrators use these terms to communicate ideas specific to the education system. Common terms and acronyms considered to be jargon that are used within this profession include:

* Capstone project
* Curriculum
* ELL (English Language Learner)
* IEP (Individualized Education Program)
* Pedagogy
* PLC (Professional Learning Community)
* STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)
=== In practice ===
Jargon may serve the purpose of a &quot;gatekeeper&quot; in conversation, signaling who is allowed into certain forms of conversation. Jargon may serve this function by dictating to which direction or depth a conversation about or within the context of a certain field or profession will go. For example, a conversation between two professionals in which one person has little previous interaction or knowledge of the other person could go one of at least two possible ways. One of the professionals (who the other professional does not know) does not use, or does not correctly use the jargon of their respective field, and is little regarded or remembered beyond small talk or fairly insignificant in this conversation. Or, if the person does use particular jargon (showing their knowledge in the field to be legitimate, educated, or of particular significance) the other professional then opens the conversation up in an in-depth or professional manner. The use of jargon can create a divide in communication, or strengthen it. Outside of conversation, jargon can become confusing in writing. When used in text, readers can become confused if there are terms used that require outside knowledge on the subject.

== Positivity ==
Ethos is used to create an appeal to authority. It is one of three pillars of persuasion created by Aristotle to create a logical argument. Ethos uses credibility to back up arguments. It can indicate to the audience that a speaker is an insider with using specialized terms in the field to make an argument based on authority and credibility.

Jargon can be used to convey meaningful information and discourse in a convenient way within communities. A subject expert may wish to avoid jargon when explaining something to a layperson. Jargon may help communicate contextual information optimally. For example, a football coach talking to their team or a doctor working with nurses.

== Accessibility and criticism ==
With the rise of the self-advocacy within the Disability Rights Movement, &quot;jargonized&quot; language has started to face repeated rejection for being language that is widely inaccessible. However, jargon is largely present in everyday language such as in newspapers, financial statements, and instruction manuals. To combat this, several advocacy organizations are working on influencing public agents to offer accessible information in different formats. One accessible format that offers an alternative to jargonized language is &quot;easy read&quot;, which consists of a combination of plain language and images.

The criticism against jargon can be found in certain fields where professionals communicate with individuals with no industry background. In a study done by analyzing 58 patients and 10 radiation therapists, professionals diagnosed and explained the treatment of a disease to a patient with the use of jargon. It was found that using jargon left patients confused about what the treatments and risks were, suggesting that jargon in the medical field is not the best in communicating the terminology and concepts. 

==Jargon glossaries==
Many examples of jargon exist because of its use among specialists and subcultures alike. In the professional world, those who are in the business of filmmaking may use words like &quot;vorkapich&quot; to refer to a montage when talking to colleagues. In rhetoric, rhetoricians use words like &quot;arete&quot; to refer to a person of power&#x27;s character when speaking with one another.

<text>The Bay of Biscay ( ) is a gulf of the northeast Atlantic Ocean located south of the Celtic Sea. It lies along the western coast of France from Point Penmarc&#x27;h to the Spanish border, and along the northern coast of Spain, extending westward to Cape Ortegal.

The average depth is and the greatest depth is .

==Etymology==
The Bay of Biscay is known in Spain as the Gulf of Biscay (; ). In France, it is called the Gulf of Gascony ( ; ; ). In Latin, the bay was known as (Cantabrian Gulf); the name Cantabrian Sea is still used locally for the southern area of the Bay of Biscay that washes over the northern coast of Spain (Cantabria). The English name comes from Biscay on the northern Spanish coast, probably standing for the western Basque districts (&quot;Biscay&quot; up to the early 19th century).

==Geography==

Parts of the continental shelf extend far into the bay, resulting in fairly shallow waters in many areas and thus the rough seas for which the region is known. Heavy storms occur in the bay, especially during the winter months. The Bay of Biscay is home to some of the Atlantic Ocean&#x27;s fiercest weather; abnormally high waves occur there. Up until recent years it was a regular occurrence for merchant vessels to founder in Biscay storms.

===Extent===
The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Bay of Biscay as &quot;a line joining Cap Ortegal () to Penmarch Point ()&quot;.

The southernmost portion is the Cantabrian Sea.

===Rivers===
The main rivers that empty into the Bay of Biscay are Loire, Charente, Garonne, Dordogne, Adour, Nivelle, Bidasoa, Oiartzun, Urumea, Oria, Urola, Deba, Artibai, Lea, Oka, Nervión, Agüera, Asón, Miera, Pas, Saja, Nansa, Deva, Sella, Nalón, Navia, Esva, Eo, Landro and Sor.

===Climate===
In late spring and early summer, a large fog triangle fills the southwestern half of the bay, covering just a few kilometres inland.

As winter begins, weather becomes severe. Depressions enter from the west very frequently, and either they bounce north to the British Isles or they enter the Ebro Valley, dry out, and are finally reborn in the form of powerful thunderstorms as they reach the Mediterranean Sea. These depressions cause severe weather at sea and bring light but very constant rain to its shores (known as &quot;orballo&quot;, &quot;sirimiri&quot;, &quot;morrina&quot;, &quot;orbayu&quot;, &quot;orpin&quot; or &quot;calabobos&quot;). Sometimes powerful windstorms form if the pressure falls rapidly (galerna), traveling along the Gulf Stream at great speed, resembling a hurricane, and finally crashing in this bay with their maximum power, such as the Klaus storm.

The Gulf Stream enters the bay following the continental shelf&#x27;s border anti-clockwise (the Rennell Current), keeping temperatures moderate all year long.

===Main cities===

The main cities on the shores (or close to) of the Bay of Biscay are Bordeaux, Bayonne, Biarritz, Nantes, La Rochelle, Donostia-San Sebastián, Bilbao, Santander, Gijón and Avilés.

==History==
The southern end of the gulf is also called &quot;&quot;Mar Cantábrico&quot; in Spanish&quot; (Cantabrian Sea), from the Estaca de Bares, as far as the mouth of Adour river, but this name is not generally used in English. It was named by Romans in the 1st century BC as &quot;Sinus Cantabrorum&quot; (Bay of the Cantabri) and also, &quot;Mare Gallaecum&quot; (the Sea of the Galicians). On some medieval maps, the Bay of Biscay is marked as &quot;El Mar del los Vascos&quot; (the Basque Sea).

The Bay of Biscay has been the site of many famous naval engagements over the centuries. In 1592 the Spanish defeated an English fleet during the Battle of the Bay of Biscay. The Biscay campaign of June 1795 consisted of a series of manoeuvres and two battles fought between the British Channel Fleet and the French Atlantic Fleet off the southern coast of Brittany during the second year of the French Revolutionary Wars. The sank here after striking a naval mine on 22 June 1918. In 1920 the sank after losing power and drifting into a reef in a storm with the loss of 575 lives. On 28 December 1943, the Battle of the Bay of Biscay was fought between and , and a group of German destroyers as part of Operation Stonewall during World War II. The area became known as the &quot;Valley of Death&quot; by U-boat crews following a series of repeated losses from RAF attacks on U-boats from 1943 until the end of the war. The sank on 25 August 1944 in position , when she struck a mine. All hands were lost.

On 12 April 1970, sank in the Bay of Biscay due to a fire that crippled the submarine&#x27;s nuclear reactors. An attempt to save the sub failed, resulting in the death of forty sailors and the loss of four nuclear torpedoes. Due to the great depth (), no salvage operation was attempted.

==Wildlife==

=== Plaiaundi Ecology Park ===
The Plaiaundi Ecology Park is a 24-hectare coastal wetland lying where the Bidasoa River meets the sea in the Bay of Biscay.The nature of Plaiaundi consists of a wide variety of flora (visitors view them mainly in the spring) and fauna (visitors with binoculars arrive all during the year, because of the birds&#x27; migratory habits). This nature park contains a variety of birds, reptiles, mammals and insects.

===Marine mammals===

The car ferries from Gijón to Nantes/Saint-Nazaire, Portsmouth to Bilbao and from Plymouth, Portsmouth and Poole to Santander provide one of the most convenient ways to see cetaceans in European waters. Often specialist groups take the ferries to collect more information. Volunteers and employees of ORCA regularly observe and monitor cetacean activity from the bridge of the ships on Brittany Ferries&#x27; Portsmouth to Santander route. Many species of whales and dolphins can be seen in this area. Most importantly, it is one of the few places in the world where the beaked whales, such as the Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale, have been observed relatively frequently. Biscay Dolphin Research monitored cetacean activity from the P&amp;O Ferries cruise ferry &quot;Pride of Bilbao&quot;, on voyages from Portsmouth to Bilbao.

North Atlantic right whales, one of the most endangered species of whales, once came to the bay for feeding and probably for calving as well, but whaling activities by Basque people almost wiped them out sometime prior to the 1850s. The eastern population of this species are considered to be almost extinct, and there has been no record of right whales in the Bay of Biscay except for a pair in 1977 (possibly a mother and calf) at , and another pair in June 1980. Other records in the late 20th century include one off Galicia at in September 1977 reported by a whaling company and another one seen off the Iberian Peninsula.

The best areas to see the larger cetaceans are in the deep waters beyond the continental shelf, particularly over the Santander Canyon and Torrelavega Canyon in the south of the Bay.

The alga &quot;Colpomenia peregrina&quot; was introduced and first noticed in 1906 by oyster fishermen in the Bay of Biscay.

&quot;Grammatostomias flagellibarba&quot; (scaleless dragonfish) are native to these waters.

<text>English grammar is the set of structural rules of the English language. This includes the structure of words, phrases, clauses, sentences, and whole texts.

==Overview==
This article describes a generalized, present-day Standard English – forms of speech and writing used in public discourse, including broadcasting, education, entertainment, government, and news, over a range of registers, from formal to informal. Divergences from the grammar described here occur in some historical, social, cultural, and regional varieties of English, although these are minor compared to the differences in pronunciation and vocabulary.

Modern English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system of Indo-European in favor of analytic constructions. The personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class (a remnant of the more extensive Germanic case system of Old English). For other pronouns, and all nouns, adjectives, and articles, grammatical function is indicated only by word order, by prepositions, and by the &quot;Saxon genitive or English possessive&quot; (&quot;-&#x27;s&quot;).

==Word classes and phrases==

Nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are open classes – word classes that readily accept new members, such as the noun &quot;celebutante&quot; (a celebrity who frequents the fashion circles), and other similar relatively new words. The rest are closed classes; for example, it is rare for a new pronoun to enter the language. Determiners, traditionally classified along with adjectives, have not always been regarded as a separate part of speech. Interjections are another word class, but these are not described here as they do not form part of the clause and sentence structure of the language.

Linguists generally accept nine English word classes: nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, determiners, and exclamations. English words are not generally marked for word class. It is not usually possible to tell from the form of a word which class it belongs to; inflectional endings and derivational suffixes are unique and specific to. On the other hand, most words belong to more than one word class. For example, &quot;run&quot; can serve as either a verb or a noun (these are regarded as two different lexemes). Lexemes may be inflected to express different grammatical categories. The lexeme &quot;run&quot; has the forms &quot;runs&quot;, &quot;ran&quot;, &quot;runny&quot;, &quot;runner&quot;, and &quot;running&quot;. Words in one class can sometimes be derived from those in another. This has the potential to give rise to new words. For example, the noun &quot;aerobics&quot; has given rise to the adjective &quot;aerobicized&quot;.

Words combine to form phrases. A phrase typically serves the same function as a word from some particular word class. For example, &quot;my very good friend Peter&quot; is a phrase that can be used in a sentence as if it were a noun, and is therefore called a noun phrase. Similarly, adjectival phrases and adverbial phrases function as if they were adjectives or adverbs, but with other types of phrases, the terminology has different implications. For example, a verb phrase consists of a verb together with any objects and other dependents; a prepositional phrase consists of a preposition and its complement (and is therefore usually a type of adverbial phrase); and a determiner phrase is a type of noun phrase containing a determiner.

===Nouns===

Many common suffixes form nouns from other nouns or from other types of words, such as &quot;-age&quot; (&quot;shrinkage&quot;), &quot;-hood&quot; (&quot;sisterhood&quot;), and so on, though many nouns are base forms containing no such suffix (&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;grass&quot;, &quot;France&quot;). Nouns are also created by converting verbs and adjectives, as with the words &quot;talk&quot; and &quot;reading&quot; (&quot;a boring talk&quot;, &quot;the assigned reading&quot;).

Nouns are sometimes classified semantically (by their meanings) as proper and common nouns (&quot;Cyrus&quot;, &quot;China&quot; vs &quot;frog&quot;, &quot;milk&quot;) or as concrete and abstract nouns (&quot;book&quot;, &quot;laptop&quot; vs &quot;embarrassment&quot;, &quot;prejudice&quot;). A grammatical distinction is often made between count (countable) nouns such as &quot;clock&quot; and &quot;city&quot;, and non-count (uncountable) nouns such as &quot;milk&quot; and &quot;decor&quot;. Some nouns can function both as countable and as uncountable such as &quot;wine&quot; in &quot;This is a good wine&quot;.

Countable nouns generally have singular and plural forms. In most cases the plural is formed from the singular by adding &quot;-[e]s&quot; (as in &quot;dogs&quot;, &quot;bushes&quot;), although there are also irregular forms (&quot;woman/women&quot;, &quot;foot/feet&quot;), including cases where the two forms are identical (&quot;sheep&quot;, &quot;series&quot;). For more details see English plural. Certain nouns can be used with plural verbs even though they are singular in form, as in &quot;The government were...&quot; (where &quot;the government&quot; is considered to refer to the people constituting the government). This is a form of synesis, and is more common in British than American English. See .

English nouns are not marked for case as they are in some languages, but they have possessive forms, through the addition of &quot;-&#x27;s&quot; (as in &quot;John&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;children&#x27;s&quot;) or just an apostrophe (with no change in pronunciation) in the case of &quot;-[e]s&quot; plurals (&quot;the dogs&#x27; owners&quot;) and sometimes other words ending with &quot;-s&quot; (&quot;Jesus&#x27; love&quot;). More generally the ending can be applied to noun phrases (as in &quot;the man you saw yesterday&#x27;s sister&quot;); see below. The possessive form can be used either as a determiner (&quot;Manyanda&#x27;s cat&quot;) or as a noun phrase (&quot;Manyanda&#x27;s is the one next to Jane&#x27;s&quot;).

The status of the possessive as an affix or a clitic is the subject of debate. It differs from the noun inflection of languages such as German, in that the genitive ending may attach to the last word of the phrase. To account for this, the possessive can be analysed, for instance as a clitic construction (an &quot;enclitic postposition&quot;) or as an inflection of the last word of a phrase (&quot;edge inflection&quot;).

====Phrases====
Noun phrases are phrases that function grammatically as nouns within sentences, for example as the subject or object of a verb. Most noun phrases have a noun as their head.

An English noun phrase typically takes the following form (not all elements need be present):

In this structure:
*the &quot;determiner&quot; may be an article (&quot;the&quot;, &quot;a[n]&quot;) or other equivalent word, as described in the following section. In many contexts, it is required for a noun phrase to include some determiner.
*&quot;pre-modifiers&quot; include adjectives and some adjective phrases (such as &quot;red&quot;, &quot;really lovely&quot;), and noun adjuncts (such as &quot;college&quot; in the phrase &quot;the college student&quot;). Adjectival modifiers usually come before noun adjuncts.
*a &quot;complement&quot; or &quot;postmodifier&quot; may be a prepositional phrase (&quot;... of London&quot;), a relative clause (like &quot;... which we saw yesterday&quot;), certain adjective or participial phrases (&quot;... sitting on the beach&quot;), or a dependent clause or infinitive phrase appropriate to the noun (like &quot;... that the world is round&quot; after a noun such as &quot;fact&quot; or &quot;statement&quot;, or &quot;... to travel widely&quot; after a noun such as &quot;desire&quot;).

An example of a noun phrase that includes all of the above-mentioned elements is &quot;that rather attractive young college student to whom you were talking&quot;. Here &quot;that&quot; is the determiner, &quot;rather attractive&quot; and &quot;young&quot; are adjectival pre-modifiers, &quot;college&quot; is a noun adjunct, &quot;student&quot; is the noun serving as the head of the phrase, and &quot;to whom you were talking&quot; is a post-modifier (a relative clause in this case). Notice the order of the pre-modifiers; the determiner &quot;that&quot; must come first and the noun adjunct &quot;college&quot; must come after the adjectival modifiers.

Coordinators such as &quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, and &quot;but&quot; can be used at various levels in noun phrases, as in &quot;John, Paul, and Mary&quot;; &quot;the matching green coat and hat&quot;; &quot;a dangerous but exciting ride&quot;; &quot;a person sitting down or standing up&quot;. See below for more explanation.

Noun phrases can also be placed in &quot;apposition&quot; (where two consecutive phrases refer to the same thing), as in &quot;that president, Abraham Lincoln, ...&quot; (where &quot;that president&quot; and &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; are in apposition). In some contexts, the same can be expressed by a prepositional phrase, as in &quot;the twin curses of famine and pestilence&quot; (meaning &quot;the twin curses&quot; that are &quot;famine and pestilence&quot;).

Particular forms of noun phrases include:
* phrases formed by the determiner &quot;the&quot; with an adjective, as in &quot;the homeless&quot;, &quot;the English&quot; (these are plural phrases referring to homeless people or English people in general);
* phrases with a pronoun rather than a noun as the head (see below);
* phrases consisting just of a possessive;
* infinitive and gerund phrases, in certain positions;
* certain clauses, such as &quot;that&quot; clauses and content clauses like &quot;what he said&quot;, in certain positions.

====Gender====

A system of grammatical gender, whereby every noun was treated as either masculine, feminine, or neuter, existed in Old English, but fell out of use during the Middle English period. Modern English retains features relating to natural gender, most prominently the use of pronouns (such as &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot;) to refer specifically to persons or animals of one or other genders and certain others (such as &quot;it&quot;) for sexless objects – although feminine pronouns are sometimes used when referring to ships (and more uncommonly some airplanes and analogous machinery) and nation-states.

Some aspects of gender usage in English have been influenced by the movement towards a preference for gender-neutral language. Animals are triple-gender nouns, being able to take masculine, feminine and neuter pronouns. While the vast majority of nouns in English do not carry gender, there remain some gendered nouns (e.g. &quot;ewe&quot;, &quot;sow&quot;, &quot;rooster&quot;) and derivational affixes (e.g. &quot;widower, waitress&quot;) that denote gender.


Many nouns that mention people&#x27;s roles and jobs can refer to either a masculine or a feminine subject, for instance &quot;cousin&quot;, &quot;teenager&quot;, &quot;teacher&quot;, &quot;doctor&quot;, &quot;student&quot;, &quot;friend&quot;, and &quot;colleague&quot;.

*Jane is my friend. She is a dentist.
*Paul is my cousin. He is a dentist.

Often the gender distinction for these neutral nouns is established by inserting the word &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot;.

*Sam is a male nurse.
*No, he is not my boyfriend; he is just a male friend.
*I have three female cousins and two male cousins.

Rarely, nouns illustrating things with no gender are referred to with a gendered pronoun to convey familiarity. It is also standard to use the gender-neutral pronoun (&quot;it&quot;).

*I love my car. She [the car] is my greatest passion.
*France is popular with her [France&#x27;s] neighbors at the moment.
*I traveled from England to New York on the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;; she [the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;] is a great ship.

===Determiners===

English determiners constitute a relatively small class of words. They include the articles &quot;the&quot; and &quot;a[n]&quot;; certain demonstrative and interrogative words such as &quot;this&quot;, &quot;that&quot;, and &quot;which&quot;; possessives such as &quot;my&quot; and &quot;whose&quot; (the role of determiner can also be played by noun possessive forms such as &quot;John&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;the girl&#x27;s&quot;); various quantifying words like &quot;all&quot;, &quot;some&quot;, &quot;many&quot;, &quot;various&quot;; and numerals (&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, etc.). There are also many phrases (such as &quot;a couple of&quot;) that can play the role of determiners.

Determiners are used in the formation of noun phrases (see above). Many words that serve as determiners can also be used as pronouns (&quot;this&quot;, &quot;that&quot;, &quot;many&quot;, etc.).

Determiners can be used in certain combinations, such as all the water&quot; and the many problems&quot;.

In many contexts, it is required for a noun phrase to be completed with an article or some other determiner. It is not grammatical to say just &quot;cat sat on table&quot;; one must say &quot;my cat sat on the table&quot;. The most common situations in which a complete noun phrase can be formed without a determiner are when it refers generally to a whole class or concept (as in &quot;dogs are dangerous&quot; and &quot;beauty is subjective&quot;) and when it is a name (&quot;Jane&quot;, &quot;Spain&quot;, etc.). This is discussed in more detail at English articles and Zero article in English.

===Pronouns===

Pronouns are a relatively small, closed class of words that function in the place of nouns or noun phrases. They include personal pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, relative pronouns, interrogative pronouns, and some others, mainly indefinite pronouns. The full set of English pronouns is presented in the following table. Nonstandard, informal and archaic forms are in &quot;italics&quot;.

† Interrogative only.

====Personal====

The personal pronouns of modern standard English are presented in the table above. They are &quot;I, you, she, he, it, we&quot;, and &quot;they&quot;. The personal pronouns are so-called not because they apply to persons (which other pronouns also do), but because they participate in the system of grammatical person (1st, 2nd, 3rd).

The second-person forms such as &quot;you&quot; are used with both singular and plural reference. In the Southern United States, y&#x27;all (you all) is used as a plural form, and various other phrases such as &quot;you guys&quot; are used in other places. An archaic set of second-person pronouns used for singular reference is &quot;thou, thee, thyself, thy, thine&quot;, which are still used in religious services and can be seen in older works, such as Shakespeare&#x27;s—in such texts, the &quot;you&quot; set of pronouns are used for plural reference, or with singular reference as a formal V-form. &quot;You&quot; can also be used as an indefinite pronoun, referring to a person in general (see generic &quot;you&quot;), compared to the more formal alternative, &quot;one&quot; (reflexive &quot;oneself&quot;, possessive &quot;one&#x27;s&quot;).

The third-person singular forms are differentiated according to the gender of the referent. For example, &quot;she&quot; is used to refer to a woman, sometimes a female animal, and sometimes an object to which feminine characteristics are attributed, such as a ship or a country. A man, and sometimes a male animal, is referred to using &quot;he&quot;. In other cases, &quot;it&quot; can be used. (See Gender in English.) The word &quot;it&quot; can also be used as a dummy subject, concerning abstract ideas like time, weather, etc., or a dummy object of a verb or preposition.

The third-person form &quot;they&quot; is used with both plural and singular referents. Historically, singular &quot;they&quot; was restricted to quantificational constructions such as &quot;Each employee should clean their desk&quot; and referential cases where the referent&#x27;s gender was unknown. However, it is increasingly used when the referent&#x27;s gender is irrelevant or when the referent is neither male nor female.

The possessive determiners such as &quot;my&quot; are used as determiners together with nouns, as in &quot;my old man&quot;, &quot;some of his friends&quot;. The second possessive forms like &quot;mine&quot; are used when they do not qualify a noun: as pronouns, as in &quot;mine is bigger than yours&quot;, and as predicates, as in &quot;this one is mine&quot;. Note also the construction &quot;a friend of mine&quot; (meaning &quot;someone who is my friend&quot;). See English possessive for more details.

====Demonstrative ====
The demonstrative pronouns of English are &quot;this&quot; (plural &quot;these&quot;), and &quot;that&quot; (plural &quot;those&quot;), as in &quot;these are good, I like that&quot;. All four words can also be used as determiners (followed by a noun), as in &quot;those cars&quot;. They can also form the alternative pronominal expressions &quot;this/that one&quot;, &quot;these/those ones&quot;.

==== Interrogative ====
The interrogative pronouns are &quot;who&quot;, &quot;what&quot;, and &quot;which&quot; (all of them can take the suffix &quot;-ever&quot; for emphasis). The pronoun &quot;who&quot; refers to a person or people; it has an oblique form &quot;whom&quot; (though in informal contexts this is usually replaced by &quot;who&quot;), and a possessive form (pronoun or determiner) &quot;whose&quot;. The pronoun &quot;what&quot; refers to things or abstracts. The word &quot;which&quot; is used to ask about alternatives from what is seen as a closed set: &quot;which (of the books) do you like best?&quot; (It can also be an interrogative determiner: &quot;which book?&quot;; this can form the alternative pronominal expressions &quot;which one&quot; and &quot;which ones&quot;.) &quot;Which&quot;, &quot;who&quot;, and &quot;what&quot; can be either singular or plural, although &quot;who&quot; and &quot;what&quot; often take a singular verb regardless of any supposed number. For more information see &quot;who&quot;.

In Old and Middle English, the roles of the three words were different from their roles today. &quot;The interrogative pronoun &quot;hwā&quot; &#x27;who, what&#x27; had only singular forms and also only distinguished between non-neuter and neuter, the neuter nominative form being &quot;hwæt&quot;&quot;. Note that neuter and non-neuter refers to the grammatical gender system of the time, rather than the so-called natural gender system of today. A small holdover of this is the ability of relative (but not interrogative) &quot;whose&quot; to refer to non-persons (e.g., &quot;the car whose door won&#x27;t open&quot;).

All the interrogative pronouns can also be used as relative pronouns, though &quot;what&quot; is quite limited in its use; see below for more details.

====Relative====
The main relative pronouns in English are &quot;who&quot; (with its derived forms &quot;whom&quot; and &quot;whose&quot;), &quot;which&quot;, and &quot;that&quot;.

The relative pronoun &quot;which&quot; refers to things rather than persons, as in &quot;the shirt, which used to be red, is faded&quot;. For persons, &quot;who&quot; is used (&quot;the man who saw me was tall&quot;). The oblique case form of &quot;who&quot; is &quot;whom&quot;, as in &quot;the man whom I saw was tall&quot;, although in informal registers &quot;who&quot; is commonly used in place of &quot;whom&quot;.

The possessive form of &quot;who&quot; is &quot;whose&quot; (for example, &quot;the man whose car is missing&quot;); however the use of &quot;whose&quot; is not restricted to persons (one can say &quot;an idea whose time has come&quot;).

The word &quot;that&quot; as a relative pronoun is normally found only in restrictive relative clauses (unlike &quot;which&quot; and &quot;who&quot;, which can be used in both restrictive and unrestrictive clauses). It can refer to either persons or things, and cannot follow a preposition. For example, one can say &quot;the song that&quot; [or &quot;which&quot;] &quot;I listened to yesterday&quot;, but &quot;the song to which&quot; [not &quot;to that&quot;] &quot;I listened yesterday&quot;. The relative pronoun &quot;that&quot; is usually pronounced with a reduced vowel (schwa), and hence differently from the demonstrative &quot;that&quot; (see Weak and strong forms in English). If &quot;that&quot; is not the subject of the relative clause, it can be omitted (&quot;the song I listened to yesterday&quot;).

The word &quot;what&quot; can be used to form a free relative clause – one that has no antecedent and that serves as a complete noun phrase in itself, as in &quot;I like what he likes&quot;. The words &quot;whatever&quot; and &quot;whichever&quot; can be used similarly, in the role of either pronouns (&quot;whatever he likes&quot;) or determiners (&quot;whatever book he likes&quot;). When referring to persons, &quot;who(ever)&quot; (and &quot;whom(ever)&quot;) can be used in a similar way.

====&quot;There&quot;====
The word &quot;there&quot; is used as a pronoun in some sentences, playing the role of a dummy subject, normally of an intransitive verb. The &quot;logical subject&quot; of the verb then appears as a complement after the verb.

This use of &quot;there&quot; occurs most commonly with forms of the verb &quot;be&quot; in existential clauses, to refer to the presence or existence of something. For example: &quot;There is a heaven&quot;; &quot;There are two cups on the table&quot;; &quot;There have been a lot of problems lately&quot;. It can also be used with other verbs: &quot;There exist two major variants&quot;; &quot;There occurred a very strange incident&quot;.

The dummy subject takes the number (singular or plural) of the logical subject (complement), hence it takes a plural verb if the complement is plural. In informal English, however, the contraction &quot;there&#x27;s&quot; is often used for both singular and plural.

The dummy subject can undergo inversion, &quot;Is there a test today?&quot; and &quot;Never has there been a man such as this&quot;. It can also appear without a corresponding logical subject, in short sentences and question tags: &quot;There wasn&#x27;t a discussion, was there? There was&quot;.

The word &quot;there&quot; in such sentences has sometimes been analyzed as an adverb, or as a dummy predicate, rather than as a pronoun. However, its identification as a pronoun is most consistent with its behavior in inverted sentences and question tags as described above.

Because the word &quot;there&quot; can also be a deictic adverb (meaning &quot;at/to that place&quot;), a sentence like &quot;There is a river&quot; could have either of two meanings: &quot;a river exists&quot; (with &quot;there&quot; as a pronoun), and &quot;a river is in that place&quot; (with &quot;there&quot; as an adverb). In speech, the adverbial &quot;there&quot; would be given stress, while the pronoun would not – in fact, the pronoun is often pronounced as a weak form, .

==== Reciprocal ====
The English reciprocal pronouns are &quot;each other&quot; and &quot;one another&quot;. Although they are written with a space, they&#x27;re best thought of as single words. No consistent distinction in meaning or use can be found between them. Like the reflexive pronouns, their use is limited to contexts where an antecedent precedes it. In the case of the reciprocals, they need to appear in the same clause as the antecedent.

====Other====
Other pronouns in English are often identical in form to determiners (especially quantifiers), such as &quot;many&quot;, &quot;a little&quot;, etc. Sometimes, the pronoun form is different, as with &quot;none&quot; (corresponding to the determiner &quot;no&quot;), &quot;nothing&quot;, &quot;everyone&quot;, &quot;somebody&quot;, etc. Many examples are listed as indefinite pronouns. Another indefinite (or impersonal) pronoun is &quot;one&quot; (with its reflexive form &quot;oneself&quot; and possessive &quot;one&#x27;s&quot;), which is a more formal alternative to generic &quot;you&quot;.

===Verbs===
The basic form of an English verb is not generally marked by any ending, although there are certain suffixes that are frequently used to form verbs, such as &quot;-ate&quot; (&quot;formulate&quot;), &quot;-fy&quot; (&quot;electrify&quot;), and &quot;-ise/ize&quot; (&quot;realise/realize&quot;). Many verbs also contain prefixes, such as &quot;un-&quot; (&quot;unmask&quot;), &quot;out-&quot; (&quot;outlast&quot;), &quot;over-&quot; (&quot;overtake&quot;), and &quot;under-&quot; (&quot;undervalue&quot;). Verbs can also be formed from nouns and adjectives by zero derivation, as with the verbs &quot;snare&quot;, &quot;nose&quot;, &quot;dry&quot;, and &quot;calm&quot;.

Most verbs have three or four inflected forms in addition to the base form: a third-person singular present tense form in &quot;-(e)s&quot; (&quot;writes&quot;, &quot;botches&quot;), a present participle and gerund form in &quot;-ing&quot; (&quot;writing&quot;), a past tense (&quot;wrote&quot;), and – though often identical to the past tense form – a past participle (&quot;written&quot;). Regular verbs have identical past tense and past participle forms in &quot;-ed&quot;, but there are 100 or so irregular English verbs with different forms (see list). The verbs &quot;have&quot;, &quot;do&quot; and &quot;say&quot; also have irregular third-person present tense forms (&quot;has&quot;, &quot;does&quot; , &quot;says&quot; ). The verb &quot;be&quot; has the largest number of irregular forms (&quot;am, is, are&quot; in the present tense, &quot;was, were&quot; in the past tense, &quot;been&quot; for the past participle).

Most of what are often referred to as verb tenses (or sometimes aspects) in English are formed using auxiliary verbs. Apart from what are called the simple present (&quot;write&quot;, &quot;writes&quot;) and simple past (&quot;wrote&quot;), there are also continuous (progressive) forms (&quot;am/is/are/was/were writing&quot;), perfect forms (&quot;have/has/had written&quot;, and the perfect continuous &quot;have/has/had been writing&quot;), future forms (&quot;will write&quot;, &quot;will be writing&quot;, &quot;will have written&quot;, &quot;will have been writing&quot;), and conditionals (also called &quot;future in the past&quot;), so forms equivalent to future ones but with &quot;would&quot; instead of &quot;will&quot;. The auxiliaries &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;should&quot; sometimes replace &quot;will&quot; and &quot;would&quot; in the first person. For the uses of these various verb forms, see English verbs and English clause syntax.

The basic form of the verb (&quot;be, write, play&quot;) is used as the infinitive, although there is also a &quot;to-infinitive&quot; (&quot;to be&quot;, &quot;to write&quot;, &quot;to play&quot;) used in many syntactical constructions. There are also infinitives corresponding to other aspects: &quot;(to) have written&quot;, &quot;(to) be writing&quot;, &quot;(to) have been writing&quot;. The second-person imperative is identical to the (basic) infinitive; other imperative forms may be made with &quot;let&quot; (&quot;let us go&quot;, or &quot;let&#x27;s go&quot;; &quot;let them eat cake&quot;).

A form identical to the infinitive can be used as a present subjunctive in certain contexts: &quot;It is important that he follow them&quot; or &quot;... that he be committed to the cause&quot;. There is also a past subjunctive (distinct from the simple past only in the possible use of &quot;were&quot; instead of &quot;was&quot;), used in some conditional sentences and similar: &quot;if I were&quot; (or &quot;was&quot;) &quot;rich...&quot;; &quot;were he to arrive now...&quot;; &quot;I wish she were&quot; (or &quot;was&quot;) &quot;here&quot;. For details see English subjunctive.

The passive voice is formed using the verb &quot;be&quot; (in the appropriate tense or form) with the past participle of the verb in question: &quot;cars are driven, he was killed, I am being tickled, it is nice to be pampered&quot;, etc. The performer of the action may be introduced in a prepositional phrase with &quot;by&quot; (as in &quot;they were killed by the invaders&quot;).

The English modal verbs consist of the core modals &quot;can&quot;, &quot;could&quot;, &quot;may&quot;, &quot;might&quot;, &quot;must&quot;, &quot;shall&quot;, &quot;should&quot;, &quot;will&quot;, &quot;would&quot;, as well as &quot;ought (to&quot;), &quot;had better&quot;, and in some uses &quot;dare&quot; and &quot;need&quot;. These do not inflect for person or number, do not occur alone, and do not have infinitive or participle forms (except synonyms, as with &quot;be/being/been able (to&quot;) for the modals &quot;can/could&quot;). The modals are used with the basic infinitive form of a verb (&quot;I can swim, he may be killed&quot;, &quot;we dare not move&quot;, &quot;need they go?&quot;), except for &quot;ought&quot;, which takes &quot;to&quot; (&quot;you ought to go&quot;). Modals can indicate the condition, probability, possibility, necessity, obligation and ability exposed by the speaker&#x27;s or writer&#x27;s attitude or expression.

The copula &quot;be&quot;, along with the modal verbs and the other auxiliaries, form a distinct class, sometimes called &quot;special verbs&quot; or simply &quot;auxiliaries&quot;. These have different syntax from ordinary lexical verbs, especially in that they make their interrogative forms by plain inversion with the subject, and their negative forms by adding &quot;not&quot; after the verb (&quot;could I...? I could not...&quot;). Apart from those already mentioned, this class may also include &quot;used to&quot; (although the forms &quot;did he use to?&quot; and &quot;he didn&#x27;t use to&quot; are also found), and sometimes &quot;have&quot; even when not an auxiliary (forms like &quot;have you a sister?&quot; and &quot;he hadn&#x27;t a clue&quot; are possible, though becoming less common). It also includes the auxiliary &quot;do&quot; (&quot;does&quot;, &quot;did&quot;); this is used with the basic infinitive of other verbs (those not belonging to the &quot;special verbs&quot; class) to make their question and negation forms, as well as emphatic forms (&quot;do I like you?&quot;; &quot;he doesn&#x27;t speak English&quot;; &quot;we did close the fridge&quot;). For more details of this, see &quot;do&quot;-support.

Some forms of the copula and auxiliaries often appear as contractions, as in &quot;I&#x27;m&quot; for &quot;I am&quot;, &quot;you&#x27;d&quot; for &quot;you would&quot; or &quot;you had&quot;, and &quot;John&#x27;s&quot; for &quot;John is&quot;. Their negated forms with following &quot;not&quot; are also often contracted (see below). For detail see English auxiliaries and contractions.

====Phrases====
A verb together with its dependents, excluding its subject, may be identified as a verb phrase (although this concept is not acknowledged in all theories of grammar). A verb phrase headed by a finite verb may also be called a predicate. The dependents may be objects, complements, and modifiers (adverbs or adverbial phrases). In English, objects and complements nearly always come after the verb; a direct object precedes other complements such as prepositional phrases, but if there is an indirect object as well, expressed without a preposition, then that precedes the direct object: &quot;give me the book&quot;, but &quot;give the book to me&quot;. Adverbial modifiers generally follow objects, although other positions are possible (see under below). Certain verb–modifier combinations, particularly when they have independent meaning (such as &quot;take on&quot; and &quot;get up&quot;), are known as &quot;phrasal verbs&quot;.

For details of possible patterns, see English clause syntax. See the Non-finite clauses section of that article for verb phrases headed by non-finite verb forms, such as infinitives and participles.

===Adjectives===
English adjectives, as with other word classes, cannot in general be identified as such by their form, although many of them are formed from nouns or other words by the addition of a suffix, such as &quot;-al&quot; (&quot;habitual&quot;), &quot;-ful&quot; (&quot;blissful&quot;), &quot;-ic&quot; (&quot;atomic&quot;), &quot;-ish&quot; (&quot;impish&quot;, &quot;youngish&quot;), &quot;-ous&quot; (&quot;hazardous&quot;), etc.; or from other adjectives using a prefix: &quot;disloyal&quot;, &quot;irredeemable&quot;, &quot;unforeseen&quot;, &quot;overtired&quot;.

Adjectives may be used attributively, as part of a noun phrase (nearly always preceding the noun they modify; for exceptions see postpositive adjective), as in &quot;the big house&quot;, or predicatively, as in &quot;the house is big&quot;. Certain adjectives are restricted to one or other use; for example, &quot;drunken&quot; is attributive (&quot;a drunken sailor&quot;), while &quot;drunk&quot; is usually predicative (&quot;the sailor was drunk&quot;).

====Comparison====
Many adjectives have comparative and superlative forms in &quot;-er&quot; and &quot;-est&quot;, such as &quot;faster&quot; and &quot;fastest&quot; (from the positive form &quot;fast&quot;). Spelling rules which maintain pronunciation apply to suffixing adjectives just as they do for similar treatment of regular past tense formation; these cover consonant doubling (as in &quot;bigger&quot; and &quot;biggest&quot;, from &quot;big&quot;) and the change of &quot;y&quot; to &quot;i&quot; after consonants (as in &quot;happier&quot; and &quot;happiest&quot;, from &quot;happy&quot;).

The adjectives &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; have the irregular forms &quot;better, best&quot; and &quot;worse, worst&quot;; also &quot;far&quot; becomes &quot;farther, farthest&quot; or &quot;further, furthest&quot;. The adjective &quot;old&quot; (for which the regular &quot;older&quot; and &quot;oldest&quot; are usual) also has the irregular forms &quot;elder&quot; and &quot;eldest&quot;, these generally being restricted to use in comparing siblings and in certain independent uses. For the comparison of adverbs, see Adverbs below.

Many adjectives, however, particularly those that are longer and less common, do not have inflected comparative and superlative forms. Instead, they can be qualified with &quot;more&quot; and &quot;most&quot;, as in &quot;beautiful, more beautiful, most beautiful&quot; (this construction is also sometimes used even for adjectives for which inflected forms do exist).

Certain adjectives are classed as ungradable. These represent properties that cannot be compared on a scale; they simply apply or do not, as with &quot;pregnant&quot;, &quot;dead&quot;, &quot;unique&quot;. Consequently, comparative and superlative forms of such adjectives are not normally used, except in a figurative, humorous or imprecise context. Similarly, such adjectives are not normally qualified with modifiers of degree such as &quot;very&quot; and &quot;fairly&quot;, although with some of them it is idiomatic to use adverbs such as &quot;completely&quot;. Another type of adjective sometimes considered ungradable is those that represent an extreme degree of some property, such as &quot;delicious&quot; and &quot;terrified&quot;.

====Phrases====
An adjective phrase is a group of words that plays the role of an adjective in a sentence. It usually has a single adjective as its head, to which modifiers and complements may be added.

Adjectives can be modified by a preceding adverb or adverb phrase, as in &quot;very warm&quot;, &quot;truly imposing&quot;, &quot;more than a little excited&quot;. Some can also be preceded by a noun or quantitative phrase, as in &quot;fat-free&quot;, &quot;two-meter-long&quot;.

Complements following the adjective may include:
* prepositional phrases: &quot;proud of him&quot;, &quot;angry at the screen&quot;, &quot;keen on breeding toads&quot;;
* infinitive phrases: &quot;anxious to solve the problem&quot;, &quot;easy to pick up&quot;;
* content clauses, i.e. &quot;that&quot; clauses and certain others: &quot;certain that he was right&quot;, &quot;unsure where they are&quot;;
* after comparatives, phrases or clauses with &quot;than&quot;: &quot;better than you&quot;, &quot;smaller than I had imagined&quot;.

An adjective phrase may include both modifiers before the adjective and a complement after it, as in &quot;very difficult to put away&quot;.

Adjective phrases containing complements after the adjective cannot normally be used as attributive adjectives &quot;before&quot; a noun. Sometimes they are used attributively after the noun, as in &quot;a woman proud of being a midwife&quot; (where they may be converted into relative clauses: &quot;a woman who is proud of being a midwife&quot;), but it is wrong to say *&quot;a proud of being a midwife woman&quot;. Exceptions include very brief and often established phrases such as &quot;easy-to-use&quot;. (Certain complements can be moved to after the noun, leaving the adjective before the noun, as in &quot;a better man than you&quot;, &quot;a hard nut to crack&quot;.)

Certain attributive adjective phrases are formed from other parts of speech, without any adjective as their head, as in &quot;a two-bedroom house&quot;, &quot;a no-jeans policy&quot;.

===Adverbs===

Adverbs perform a wide range of functions. They typically modify verbs (or verb phrases), adjectives (or adjectival phrases), or other adverbs (or adverbial phrases). However, adverbs also sometimes qualify noun phrases (only the boss&quot;; quite a lovely place&quot;), pronouns and determiners (almost all&quot;), prepositional phrases (halfway through the movie&quot;), or whole sentences, to provide contextual comment or indicate an attitude (&quot;Frankly, I don&#x27;t believe you&quot;). They can also indicate a relationship between clauses or sentences (&quot;He died, and consequently I inherited the estate&quot;).

Many English adverbs are formed from adjectives by adding the ending &quot;-ly&quot;, as in &quot;hopefully&quot;, &quot;widely&quot;, &quot;theoretically&quot; (for details of spelling and etymology, see &quot;-ly&quot;). Certain words can be used as both adjectives and adverbs, such as &quot;fast&quot;, &quot;straight&quot;, and &quot;hard&quot;; these are flat adverbs. In earlier usage more flat adverbs were accepted in formal usage; many of these survive in idioms and colloquially. (&quot;That&#x27;s just plain ugly&quot;.) Some adjectives can also be used as flat adverbs when they actually describe the subject. (&quot;The streaker ran naked, not &quot;The streaker ran nakedly.) The adverb corresponding to the adjective &quot;good&quot; is &quot;well&quot; (note that &quot;bad&quot; forms the regular &quot;badly&quot;, although &quot;ill&quot; is occasionally used in some phrases).

There are also many adverbs that are not derived from adjectives, including adverbs of time, of frequency, of place, of degree and with other meanings. Some suffixes that are commonly used to form adverbs from nouns are &quot;-ward[s]&quot; (as in &quot;homeward[s]&quot;) and &quot;-wise&quot; (as in &quot;lengthwise&quot;).

Adverbs are also formed by adding -&quot;ly&quot; to the participles. For example, &quot;according,&quot; a present participle adjective, becomes &quot;accordingly,&quot; an adverb, by adding -&quot;ly&quot; after it. The past participle adjective &quot;repeated&quot; becomes &quot;repeatedly&quot; by adding -&quot;ly&quot; after it.

Most adverbs form comparatives and superlatives by modification with &quot;more&quot; and &quot;most&quot;: &quot;often&quot;, &quot;more often&quot;, &quot;most often&quot;; &quot;smoothly&quot;, &quot;more smoothly&quot;, &quot;most smoothly&quot; (see also comparison of adjectives, above). However, a few adverbs retain irregular inflection for comparative and superlative forms: &quot;much&quot;, &quot;more&quot;, &quot;most&quot;; &quot;a little&quot;, &quot;less&quot;, &quot;least&quot;; &quot;well&quot;, &quot;better&quot;, &quot;best&quot;; &quot;badly&quot;, &quot;worse&quot;, &quot;worst&quot;; &quot;far&quot;, &quot;further&quot; (&quot;farther&quot;), &quot;furthest&quot; (&quot;farthest&quot;); or follow the regular adjectival inflection: &quot;fast&quot;, &quot;faster&quot;, &quot;fastest&quot;; &quot;soon&quot;, &quot;sooner&quot;, &quot;soonest&quot;; etc.

Adverbs indicating the manner of an action are generally placed after the verb and its objects (&quot;We considered the proposal carefully), although other positions are often possible (&quot;We carefully considered the proposal&quot;). Many adverbs of frequency, degree, certainty, etc. (such as &quot;often&quot;, &quot;always&quot;, &quot;almost&quot;, &quot;probably&quot;, and various others such as &quot;just&quot;) tend to be placed before the verb (&quot;they usually have chips&quot;), although if there is an auxiliary or other &quot;special verb&quot; (see above), then the normal position for such adverbs is after that special verb (or after the first of them, if there is more than one): &quot;I have just finished the crossword&quot;; &quot;She can usually manage a pint&quot;; &quot;We are never late&quot;; &quot;You might possibly have been unconscious&quot;. Adverbs that provide a connection with previous information (such as &quot;next&quot;, &quot;then&quot;, &quot;however&quot;), and those that provide the context (such as time or place) for a sentence, are typically placed at the start of the sentence: Yesterday we went on a shopping expedition&quot;. If the verb has an object, the adverb comes after the object (&quot;He finished the test quickly). When there is more than one type of adverb, they usually appear in the order: manner, place, time (&quot;His arm was hurt severely at home yesterday).

A special type of adverb is the adverbial particle used to form phrasal verbs (such as &quot;up&quot; in &quot;pick up&quot;, &quot;on&quot; in &quot;get on&quot;, etc.) If such a verb also has an object, then the particle may precede or follow the object, although it will normally follow the object if the object is a pronoun (&quot;pick the pen up&quot; or &quot;pick up the pen&quot;, but &quot;pick it up&quot;).

====Phrases====
An adverb phrase is a phrase that acts as an adverb within a sentence. An adverb phrase may have an adverb as its head, together with any modifiers (other adverbs or adverb phrases) and complements, analogously to the adjective phrases described above. For example: &quot;very sleepily&quot;; &quot;all too suddenly&quot;; &quot;oddly enough&quot;; &quot;perhaps shockingly for us&quot;.

Another very common type of adverb phrase is the prepositional phrase, which consists of a preposition and its object: &quot;in the pool&quot;; &quot;after two years&quot;; &quot;for the sake of harmony&quot;.

===Prepositions===

Prepositions form a closed word class, although there are also certain phrases that serve as prepositions, such as &quot;in front of&quot;. A single preposition may have a variety of meanings, often including temporal, spatial and abstract. Many words that are prepositions can also serve as adverbs. Examples of common English prepositions (including phrasal instances) are: &quot;of&quot;, &quot;in&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, &quot;over&quot;, &quot;under&quot;, &quot;to&quot;, &quot;from&quot;, &quot;with&quot;, &quot;in front of&quot;, &quot;behind&quot;, &quot;opposite&quot;, &quot;by&quot;, &quot;before&quot;, &quot;after&quot;, &quot;during&quot;, &quot;through&quot;, &quot;in spite of&quot; or &quot;despite&quot;, &quot;between&quot;, &quot;among&quot;, etc.

A preposition is usually used with a noun phrase as its complement. A preposition together with its complement is called a prepositional phrase. Examples are &quot;in England&quot;, &quot;under the table&quot;, &quot;after six pleasant weeks&quot;, &quot;between the land and the sea&quot;. A prepositional phrase can be used as a complement or post-modifier of a noun in a noun phrase, as in &quot;the man in the car&quot;, &quot;the start of the fight&quot;; as a complement of a verb or adjective, as in &quot;deal with the problem&quot;, &quot;proud of oneself&quot;; or generally as an adverb phrase (see above).

English allows the use of &quot;stranded&quot; prepositions. This can occur in interrogative and relative clauses, where the interrogative or relative pronoun that is the preposition&#x27;s complement is moved to the start (fronted), leaving the preposition in place. This kind of structure is avoided in some kinds of formal English. For example:
*&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; (Possible alternative version: &quot;About what are you talking?&quot;)
*&quot;The song that you were listening to...&quot; (more formal: &quot;The song to which you were listening...&quot;)
Notice that in the second example the relative pronoun &quot;that&quot; could be omitted.

Stranded prepositions can also arise in passive voice constructions and other uses of passive past participial phrases, where the complement in a prepositional phrase can become zero in the same way that a verb&#x27;s direct object would: &quot;it was looked at&quot;; &quot;I will be operated on&quot;; &quot;get your teeth seen to&quot;. The same can happen in certain uses of infinitive phrases: &quot;he is nice to talk to&quot;; &quot;this is the page to make copies of&quot;.

===Conjunctions===
Conjunctions express a variety of logical relations between items, phrases, clauses and sentences. They help link ideas, show relationships, and form more complex sentences. 

The principal coordinating conjunctions in English are: &quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, &quot;but&quot;, &quot;nor&quot;, &quot;so&quot;, &quot;yet&quot;, and &quot;for&quot;. These can be used in many grammatical contexts to link two or more items of equal grammatical status, for example:
*Noun phrases combined into a longer noun phrase, such as &quot;John, Eric, and Jill&quot;, &quot;the red coat or the blue one&quot;. When &quot;and&quot; is used, the resulting noun phrase is plural. A determiner does not need to be repeated with the individual elements: &quot;the cat, the dog, and the mouse&quot; and &quot;the cat, dog, and mouse&quot; are both correct. The same applies to other modifiers. (The word &quot;but&quot; can be used here in the sense of &quot;except&quot;: &quot;nobody but you&quot;.)
*Adjective or adverb phrases combined into a longer adjective or adverb phrase: &quot;tired but happy&quot;, &quot;over the fields and far away&quot;.
*Verbs or verb phrases combined as in &quot;he washed, peeled, and diced the turnips&quot; (verbs conjoined, object shared); &quot;he washed the turnips, peeled them, and diced them&quot; (full verb phrases, including objects, conjoined).
*Other equivalent items linked, such as prefixes linked in &quot;pre- and post-test counselling&quot;, numerals as in &quot;two or three buildings&quot;, etc.
*Clauses or sentences linked, as in &quot;We came, but they wouldn&#x27;t let us in. They wouldn&#x27;t let us in, nor would they explain what we had done wrong&quot;. 
Another example of clauses or sentences linked is: &quot;I like reading books, and I also enjoy watching movies&quot;.

There are also correlative conjunctions, where as well as the basic conjunction, an additional element appears before the first of the items being linked. The common correlatives in English are:
* &quot;either... or...&quot; (&quot;either a man or a woman&quot;);
* &quot;neither... nor...&quot; (&quot;neither clever nor funny&quot;);
* &quot;both... and...&quot; (&quot;they both punished and rewarded them&quot;);
* &quot;not... but...&quot;, particularly in &quot;not only... but also...&quot; (not exhausted but exhilarated&quot;, not only football but also many other sports&quot;).

An example of a correlative conjunction can be seen in: &quot; Not only did I finish my homework, but I also helped my sibling&quot;.

Subordinators make relations between clauses, making the clause in which they appear into a subordinate clause. Some common subordinators in English are:
*conjunctions of time, including &quot;after&quot;, &quot;before&quot;, &quot;since&quot;, &quot;until&quot;, &quot;when&quot;, &quot;while&quot;;
*conjunctions of cause and effect, including &quot;because&quot;, &quot;since&quot;, &quot;now that&quot;, &quot;as&quot;, &quot;in order that&quot;, &quot;so&quot;;
*conjunctions of opposition or concession, such as &quot;although&quot;, &quot;though&quot;, &quot;even though&quot;, &quot;whereas&quot;, &quot;while&quot;;
*conjunctions of condition: such as &quot;if&quot;, &quot;unless&quot;, &quot;only if&quot;, &quot;whether or not&quot;, &quot;even if&quot;, &quot;in case (that)&quot;;
*the conjunction &quot;that&quot;, which produces content clauses, as well as words that produce interrogative content clauses: &quot;whether&quot;, &quot;where&quot;, &quot;when&quot;, &quot;how&quot;, etc.

Subordinating conjunction generally comes at the very start of its clause, although many of them can be preceded by qualifying adverbs, as in &quot;probably because...&quot;, &quot;especially if...&quot;. The conjunction &quot;that&quot; can be omitted after certain verbs, as in &quot;she told us (that) she was ready&quot;. (For the use of &quot;that&quot; in relative clauses, see above.)

An example of a subordinating conjunction being used is: &quot;I went to the store because I needed milk&quot;.

===Case===
Although English has largely lost its case system, personal pronouns still have three morphological cases that are simplified forms of the nominative, objective and genitive cases:

* The &quot;nominative case&quot; (&quot;subjective pronouns&quot; such as &quot;I&quot;, &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;they&quot;, &quot;who&quot;, &quot;whoever&quot;), used for the subject of a finite verb and sometimes for the complement of a copula.
* The &quot;oblique case&quot; (&quot;object pronouns&quot; such as &quot;me&quot;, &quot;him&quot;, &quot;her&quot;, &quot;it&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, &quot;them&quot;, &quot;whom&quot;, &quot;whomever&quot;), used for the direct or indirect object of a verb, for the object of a preposition, for an absolute disjunct, and sometimes for the complement of a copula.
* The &quot;genitive case&quot; (&quot;possessive pronouns&quot; such as &quot;my/mine&quot;, &quot;his&quot;, &quot;her(s)&quot;, &quot;its&quot;, &quot;our(s)&quot;, &quot;their(s)&quot;, &quot;whose&quot;), used for a grammatical possessor. This is not always considered to be a case; see .

Most English personal pronouns have five forms: the nominative and oblique case forms, the possessive case, which has both a &quot;determiner&quot; form (such as &quot;my&quot;, &quot;our&quot;) and a distinct &quot;independent&quot; form (such as &quot;mine&quot;, &quot;ours&quot;) (with two exceptions: the third person singular masculine and the third person singular neuter &quot;it&quot;, which use the same form for both determiner and independent [&quot;his car&quot;, &quot;it is his&quot;]), and a distinct &quot;reflexive&quot; or &quot;intensive&quot; form (such as &quot;myself&quot;, &quot;ourselves&quot;). The interrogative personal pronoun &quot;who&quot; exhibits the greatest diversity of forms within the modern English pronoun system, having definite nominative, oblique, and genitive forms (&quot;who&quot;, &quot;whom&quot;, &quot;whose&quot;) and equivalently coordinating indefinite forms (&quot;whoever&quot;, &quot;whomever&quot;, and &quot;whosever&quot;).

Forms such as &quot;I&quot;, &quot;he&quot;, and &quot;we&quot; are used for the subject (&quot;I kicked the ball&quot;), whereas forms such as &quot;me&quot;, &quot;him&quot; and &quot;us&quot; are used for the object (&quot;John kicked me&quot;).

===Declension===

Nouns have distinct singular and plural forms; that is, they &quot;decline&quot; to reflect their grammatical number; consider the difference between &quot;book&quot; and &quot;books&quot;. In addition, a few English pronouns have distinct nominative (also called subjective) and oblique (or objective) forms; that is, they decline to reflect their relationship to a verb or preposition, or case. Consider the difference between &quot;he&quot; (subjective) and &quot;him&quot; (objective), as in &quot;He saw it&quot; and &quot;It saw him&quot;; similarly, consider &quot;who&quot;, which is subjective, and the objective &quot;whom&quot;. Further, these pronouns and a few others have distinct possessive forms, such as &quot;his&quot; and &quot;whose&quot;. By contrast, nouns have no distinct nominative and objective forms, the two being merged into a single &quot;plain case&quot;. For example, &quot;chair&quot; does not change form between &quot;the chair is here&quot; (subject) and &quot;I saw the chair&quot; (direct object). Possession is shown by the clitic &quot;-&#x27;s&quot; attached to a possessive noun phrase, rather than by declension of the noun itself.

==Negation==
As noted above under , a finite indicative verb (or its clause) is negated by placing the word &quot;not&quot; after an auxiliary, modal or other &quot;special&quot; verb such as &quot;do&quot;, &quot;can&quot; or &quot;be&quot;. For example, the clause &quot;I go&quot; is negated with the appearance of the auxiliary &quot;do&quot;, as &quot;I do not go&quot; (see &quot;do&quot;-support). When the affirmative already uses auxiliary verbs (&quot;I am going&quot;), no other auxiliary &quot;verbs&quot; are added to negate the clause (&quot;I am not going&quot;). (Until the period of early Modern English, negation was effected without additional auxiliary verbs: &quot;I go not&quot;.)

Most combinations of auxiliary verbs etc. with &quot;not&quot; have contracted forms: &quot;don&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;can&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;isn&#x27;t&quot;, etc. (Also the uncontracted negated form of &quot;can&quot; is written as a single word &quot;cannot&quot;.) On the inversion of subject and verb (such as in questions; see below), the subject may be placed after a contracted negated form: &quot;Should he not pay?&quot; or &quot;Shouldn&#x27;t he pay?&quot;

Other elements, such as noun phrases, adjectives, adverbs, infinitive and participial phrases, etc., can be negated by placing the word &quot;not&quot; before them: &quot;not the right answer&quot;, &quot;not interesting&quot;, &quot;not to enter&quot;, &quot;not noticing the train&quot;, etc.

When other negating words such as &quot;never&quot;, &quot;nobody&quot;, etc. appear in a sentence, the negating &quot;not&quot; is omitted (unlike its equivalents in many languages): &quot;I saw nothing&quot; or &quot;I didn&#x27;t see anything&quot;, but not (except in non-standard speech) *&quot;I didn&#x27;t see nothing&quot; (see Double negative). Such negating words generally have corresponding negative polarity items (&quot;ever&quot; for &quot;never&quot;, &quot;anybody&quot; for &quot;nobody&quot;, etc.) which can appear in a negative context but are not negative themselves (and can thus be used after a negation without giving rise to double negatives).

==Clause and sentence structure==

A typical sentence contains one independent clause and possibly one or more dependent clauses, although it is also possible to link together sentences of this form into longer sentences, using coordinating conjunctions (see above). A clause typically contains a subject (a noun phrase) and a predicate (a verb phrase in the terminology used above; that is, a verb together with its objects and complements). A dependent clause also normally contains a subordinating conjunction (or in the case of relative clauses, a relative pronoun, or phrase containing one).

===Word order===
English word order has moved from the Germanic verb-second (V2) word order to being almost exclusively subject–verb–object (SVO). The combination of SVO order and use of auxiliary verbs often creates clusters of two or more verbs at the center of the sentence, such as &quot;he had hoped to try to open it&quot;. In most sentences, English marks grammatical relations only through word order. The subject constituent precedes the verb and the object constituent follows it. The Object–subject–verb (OSV) may on occasion be seen in English, usually in the future tense or used as a contrast with the conjunction &quot;but&quot;, such as in the following examples: &quot;Rome I shall see!&quot;, &quot;I hate oranges, but apples I&#x27;ll eat!&quot;.

===Questions===
Like many other Western European languages, English historically allowed questions to be formed by inverting the positions of the verb and subject. Modern English permits this only in the case of a small class of verbs (&quot;special verbs&quot;), consisting of auxiliaries as well as forms of the copula &quot;be&quot; (see subject–auxiliary inversion). To form a question from a sentence which does not have such an auxiliary or copula present, the auxiliary verb &quot;do&quot; (&quot;does&quot;, &quot;did&quot;) needs to be inserted, along with inversion of the word order, to form a question (see &quot;do&quot;-support). For example:
* She can dance. → Can she dance? (inversion of subject &quot;she&quot; and auxiliary &quot;can&quot;)
* I am sitting here. → Am I sitting here? (inversion of subject &quot;I&quot; and copula &quot;am&quot;)
* The milk goes in the fridge. → Does the milk go in the fridge? (no special verb present; &quot;do&quot;-support required)

The above concerns yes–no questions, but inversion also takes place in the same way after other questions, formed with interrogative words such as &quot;where&quot;, &quot;what&quot;, &quot;how&quot;, etc. An exception applies when the interrogative word is the subject or part of the subject, in which case there is no inversion. For example:
* I go. → Where do I go? (&quot;wh&quot;-question formed using inversion, with &quot;do&quot;-support required in this case)
* He goes. → Who goes? (no inversion, because the question word &quot;who&quot; is the subject)

Inversion does not apply in indirect questions: &quot;I wonder where he is&quot; (not *&quot;... where is he&quot;). Indirect yes–no questions can be expressed using &quot;if&quot; or &quot;whether&quot; as the interrogative word: &quot;Ask them whether/if they saw him&quot;.

Negative questions are formed similarly; however, if the verb undergoing inversion has a contraction with &quot;not&quot;, then it is possible to invert the subject with this contraction as a whole. For example:
* John is going. (affirmative)
* John is not going. / John isn&#x27;t going. (negative, with and without contraction)
* Isn&#x27;t John going? / Is John not going? (negative question, with and without contraction respectively)

===Dependent clauses===
The syntax of a dependent clause is generally the same as that of an independent clause, except that the dependent clause usually begins with a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun (or phrase containing such). In some situations (as already described) the conjunction or relative pronoun &quot;that&quot; can be omitted. Another type of dependent clause with no subordinating conjunction is the conditional clause formed by inversion (see below).

===Other uses of inversion===
The clause structure with an inverted subject and verb, used to form questions as described above, is also used in certain types of declarative sentences. This occurs mainly when the sentence begins with adverbial or other phrases that are essentially negative or contain words such as &quot;only&quot;, &quot;hardly&quot;, etc.: &quot;Never have I known someone so stupid; Only in France can such food be tasted&quot;.

In elliptical sentences (see below), inversion takes place after &quot;so&quot; (meaning &quot;also&quot;) as well as after the negative &quot;neither&quot;: &quot;so do I, neither does she&quot;.

Inversion can also be used to form conditional clauses, beginning with &quot;should&quot;, &quot;were&quot; (subjunctive), or &quot;had&quot;, in the following ways:
*&quot;should I win the race&quot; (equivalent to &quot;if I win the race&quot;);
*&quot;were he a soldier&quot; (equivalent to &quot;if he were a soldier&quot;);
*&quot;were he to win the race&quot; (equivalent to &quot;if he were to win the race&quot;, i.e. &quot;if he won the race&quot;);
*&quot;had he won the race&quot; (equivalent to &quot;if he had won the race&quot;).
Other similar forms sometimes appear but are less common. There is also a construction with subjunctive &quot;be&quot;, as in &quot;be he alive or dead&quot; (meaning &quot;no matter whether he is alive or dead&quot;).

Use of inversion to express a third-person imperative is now mostly confined to the expression &quot;long live X&quot;, meaning &quot;let X live long&quot;.

===Imperatives===
In an imperative sentence (one giving an order), there is usually no subject in the independent clause: &quot;Go away until I call you&quot;. It is possible, however, to include &quot;you&quot; as the subject for emphasis: &quot;You stay away from me&quot;.

===Elliptical constructions===
Many types of elliptical construction are possible in English, resulting in sentences that omit certain redundant elements. Various examples are given in the article on Ellipsis.

Some notable elliptical forms found in English include:
*Short statements of the form &quot;I can&quot;, &quot;he isn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;we mustn&#x27;t&quot;. Here the verb phrase (understood from the context) is reduced to a single auxiliary or other &quot;special&quot; verb, negated if appropriate. If there is no special verb in the original verb phrase, it is replaced by &quot;do/does/did&quot;: &quot;he does&quot;, &quot;they didn&#x27;t&quot;.
*Clauses that omit the verb, in particular those like &quot;me too&quot;, &quot;nor me&quot;, &quot;me neither&quot;. The latter forms are used after negative statements. (Equivalents including the verb: &quot;I do too&quot; or &quot;so do I&quot;; &quot;I don&#x27;t either&quot; or &quot;neither do I&quot;.)
*Tag questions, formed with a special verb and pronoun subject: &quot;isn&#x27;t it?&quot;; &quot;were there?&quot;; &quot;am I not?&quot;

==History of English grammars==

The first published English grammar was a &quot;Pamphlet for Grammar&quot; of 1586, written by William Bullokar with the stated goal of demonstrating that English was just as rule-based as Latin. Bullokar&#x27;s grammar was faithfully modeled on William Lily&#x27;s Latin grammar, &quot;Rudimenta Grammatices&quot; (1534), used in English schools at that time, having been &quot;prescribed&quot; for them in 1542 by Henry VIII. Bullokar wrote his grammar in English and used a &quot;reformed spelling system&quot; of his own invention; but much English grammar, for much of the century after Bullokar&#x27;s effort, was written in Latin, especially by authors who were aiming to be scholarly. John Wallis&#x27;s &quot;Grammatica Linguae Anglicanae&quot; (1685) was the last English grammar written in Latin.

Even as late as the early 19th century, Lindley Murray, the author of one of the most widely used grammars of the day, was having to cite &quot;grammatical authorities&quot; to bolster the claim that grammatical cases in English are different from those in Ancient Greek or Latin.

English parts of speech are based on Latin and Greek parts of speech. Some English grammar rules were adopted from Latin, for example John Dryden is thought to have created the rule no sentences can end in a preposition because Latin cannot end sentences in prepositions. The rule of no split infinitives was adopted from Latin because Latin has no split infinitives.

<text>Menopause, also known as the climacteric, is the time when menstrual periods permanently stop, marking the end of the reproductive stage for the female human. It typically occurs between the ages of 45 and 55, although the exact timing can vary. Menopause is usually a natural change related to a decrease in circulating blood estrogen levels. It can occur earlier in those who smoke tobacco. Other causes include surgery that removes both ovaries, some types of chemotherapy, or anything that leads to a decrease in hormone levels. At the physiological level, menopause happens because of a decrease in the ovaries&#x27; production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. While typically not needed, measuring hormone levels in the blood or urine can confirm a diagnosis. Menopause is the opposite of menarche, the time when periods start.
In the years before menopause, a woman&#x27;s periods typically become irregular, which means that periods may be longer or shorter in duration, or be lighter or heavier in the amount of flow. During this time, women often experience hot flashes; these typically last from 30 seconds to ten minutes and may be associated with shivering, night sweats, and reddening of the skin. Hot flashes can recur for four to five years. Other symptoms may include vaginal dryness, trouble sleeping, and mood changes. The severity of symptoms varies between women. Menopause before the age of 45 years is considered to be &quot;early menopause&quot;, and when ovarian failure/surgical removal of the ovaries occurs before the age of 40 years this is termed &quot;premature ovarian insufficiency&quot;.

In addition to symptoms (hot flushes/flashes, night sweats, mood changes, arthralgia and vaginal dryness), the physical consequences of menopause include bone loss, increased central abdominal fat, and adverse changes in a woman&#x27;s cholesterol profile and vascular function. These changes predispose postmenopausal women to increased risks of osteoporosis and bone fracture, and of cardio-metabolic disease (diabetes and cardiovascular disease).
Medical professionals often define menopause as having occurred when a woman has not had any menstrual bleeding for a year. It may also be defined by a decrease in hormone production by the ovaries. In those who have had surgery to remove their uterus but still have functioning ovaries, menopause is not considered to have yet occurred. Following the removal of the uterus, symptoms of menopause typically occur earlier. Iatrogenic menopause occurs when both ovaries are surgically removed (Oophorectomy) along with the uterus for medical reasons.
Medical treatment of menopause is primarily to ameliorate symptoms and prevent bone loss. Mild symptoms may be improved with treatment. With respect to hot flashes, avoiding nicotine, caffeine, and alcohol is often recommended; sleeping naked in a cool room and using a fan may help. The most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms is menopausal hormone therapy (MHT). Non-hormonal therapies for hot flashes include cognitive-behavioral therapy, clinical hypnosis, gabapentin, fezolinetant or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. These will not improve symptoms such as joint pain or vaginal dryness, which affect over 55% of women. Exercise may help with sleeping problems. Many of the concerns about the use of MHT raised by older studies are no longer considered barriers to MHT in healthy women. High-quality evidence for the effectiveness of alternative medicine has not been found.
== Signs and symptoms ==

During early menopause transition, the menstrual cycles remain regular but the interval between cycles begins to lengthen. Hormone levels begin to fluctuate. Ovulation may not occur with each cycle.

The term &quot;menopause&quot; refers to a point in time that follows one year after the last menstruation. During the menopausal transition and after menopause, women can experience a wide range of symptoms. However, for women who enter the menopause transition without having regular menstrual cycles (due to prior surgery, other medical conditions or ongoing hormonal contraception) the menopause cannot be identified by bleeding patterns and is defined as the permanent loss of ovarian function.

===Vagina, uterus and bladder (urogenital tract)===

During the transition to menopause, menstrual patterns can show shorter cycling (by 2–7 days); longer cycles remain possible. There may be irregular bleeding (lighter, heavier, spotting). Dysfunctional uterine bleeding is often experienced by women approaching menopause due to the hormonal changes that accompany the menopause transition. Spotting or bleeding may simply be related to vaginal atrophy, a benign sore (polyp or lesion), or may be a functional endometrial response. The European Menopause and Andropause Society has released guidelines for assessment of the endometrium, which is usually the main source of spotting or bleeding.

In post-menopausal women, however, any unscheduled vaginal bleeding is of concern and requires an appropriate investigation to rule out the possibility of malignant diseases.

Urogenital symptoms may appear during menopause and continue through postmenopause and include painful intercourse, vaginal dryness and atrophic vaginitis (thinning of the membranes of the vulva, the vagina, the cervix and the outer urinary tract). There may also be considerable shrinking and loss in elasticity of all of the outer and inner genital areas. Urinary urgency may also occur and urinary incontinence in some women.

=== Other physical effects ===

The most common physical symptoms of menopause are heavy night sweats, and hot flashes (also known as vasomotor symptoms). Sleeping problems and insomnia are also common. Other physical symptoms may be reported that are not specific to menopause but may be exacerbated by it, such as lack of energy, joint soreness, stiffness, back pain, breast enlargement, breast pain, heart palpitations, headache, dizziness, dry, itchy skin, thinning, tingling skin, rosacea, weight gain.

=== Mood and memory effects ===
Psychological symptoms are often reported but they are not specific to menopause and can be caused by other factors. They include anxiety, poor memory, inability to concentrate, depressive mood, irritability, mood swings, and less interest in sexual activity.

Menopause-related cognitive impairment can be confused with the mild cognitive impairment that precedes dementia. There is evidence of small decreases in verbal memory, on average, which may be caused by the effects of declining estrogen levels on the brain, or perhaps by reduced blood flow to the brain during hot flashes. However, these tend to resolve for most women during the postmenopause. Subjective reports of memory and concentration problems are associated with several factors, such as lack of sleep, and stress.

=== Long-term effects ===
==== Cardiovascular health ====
Exposure to endogenous estrogen during reproductive years provides women with protection against cardiovascular disease, which is lost around 10 years after the onset of menopause. The menopausal transition is associated with an increase in fat mass (predominantly in visceral fat), an increase in insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, and endothelial dysfunction. Women with vasomotor symptoms during menopause seem to have an especially unfavorable cardiometabolic profile, as well as women with premature onset of menopause (before 45 years of age). These risks can be reduced by managing risk factors, such as tobacco smoking, hypertension, increased blood lipids and body weight.

==== Bone health ====
The annual rates of bone mineral density loss are highest starting one year before the final menstrual period and continuing through the two years after it. Thus, post menopausal women are at increased risk of osteopenia, osteoporosis and fractures.

== Causes ==
Menopause is a normal event in a woman&#x27;s life and a natural part of aging. Menopause can also be induced early. Induced menopause occurs as a result of medical treatment such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, oophorectomy, or complications of tubal ligation, hysterectomy, unilateral or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or leuprorelin usage.

=== Age ===
Menopause typically occurs at some point between 47 and 54 years of age. According to various data, more than 95% of women have their last period between the ages of 44–56 (median 49–50). 2% of women under the age of 40, 5% between the ages of 40–45 and the same number between the ages of 55–58 have their last bleeding. The average age of the last period in the United States is 51 years, in Russia is 50 years, in Greece is 49 years, in Turkey is 47 years, in Egypt is 47 years and in India is 46 years. Beyond the influence of genetics, these differences are also due to early-life environmental conditions and associated with epigenetic effects. The menopausal transition or perimenopause leading up to menopause usually lasts 3–4 years (sometimes as long as 5–14 years).

Undiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease is a risk factor for early menopause. Coeliac disease can present with several non-gastrointestinal symptoms, in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, and most cases escape timely recognition and go undiagnosed, leading to a risk of long-term complications. A strict gluten-free diet reduces the risk. Women with early diagnosis and treatment of coeliac disease present a normal duration of fertile life span.

Women who have undergone hysterectomy with ovary conservation go through menopause on average 1.5 years earlier than the expected age.

=== Premature ovarian insufficiency ===
In rare cases, a woman&#x27;s ovaries stop working at a very early age, ranging anywhere from the age of puberty to age 40. This is known as premature ovarian failure or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) and affects 1 to 2% of women by age 40. It is diagnosed or confirmed by high blood levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) on at least three occasions at least four weeks apart.

Premature ovarian insufficiency may be related to an auto immune disorder and therefore might co-occur with other autoimmune disorders such as thyroid disease, [adrenal insufficiency], and diabetes mellitus. Other causes include chemotherapy, being a carrier of the fragile X syndrome gene, and radiotherapy. However, in about 50–80% of cases of premature ovarian insufficiency, the cause is unknown, i.e., it is generally idiopathic.

Early menopause can be related to cigarette smoking, higher body mass index, racial and ethnic factors, illnesses, and the removal of the uterus.

=== Surgical menopause ===
Menopause can be surgically induced by bilateral oophorectomy (removal of ovaries), which is often, but not always, done in conjunction with removal of the fallopian tubes (salpingo-oophorectomy) and uterus (hysterectomy). Cessation of menses as a result of removal of the ovaries is called &quot;surgical menopause&quot;. Surgical treatments, such as the removal of ovaries, might cause periods to stop altogether. The sudden and complete drop in hormone levels may produce extreme withdrawal symptoms such as hot flashes, etc. The symptoms of early menopause may be more severe.

Removal of the uterus &quot;without&quot; removal of the ovaries does &quot;not&quot; directly cause menopause, although pelvic surgery of this type can often precipitate a somewhat earlier menopause, perhaps because of a compromised blood supply to the ovaries. The time between surgery and possible early menopause is due to the fact that ovaries are still producing hormones.

== Mechanism ==

The menopausal transition, and postmenopause itself, is a natural change, not usually a disease state or a disorder. The main cause of this transition is the natural depletion and aging of the finite amount of oocytes (ovarian reserve). This process is sometimes accelerated by other conditions and is known to occur earlier after a wide range of gynecologic procedures such as hysterectomy (with and without ovariectomy), endometrial ablation and uterine artery embolisation. The depletion of the ovarian reserve causes an increase in circulating follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels because there are fewer oocytes and follicles responding to these hormones and producing estrogen.

The transition has a variable degree of effects.

The stages of the menopause transition have been classified according to a woman&#x27;s reported bleeding pattern, supported by changes in the pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels.

In younger women, during a normal menstrual cycle the ovaries produce estradiol, testosterone and progesterone in a cyclical pattern under the control of FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH), which are both produced by the pituitary gland. During perimenopause (approaching menopause), estradiol levels and patterns of production remain relatively unchanged or may increase compared to young women, but the cycles become frequently shorter or irregular. The often observed increase in estrogen is presumed to be in response to elevated FSH levels that, in turn, is hypothesized to be caused by decreased feedback by inhibin. Similarly, decreased inhibin feedback after hysterectomy is hypothesized to contribute to increased ovarian stimulation and earlier menopause.

The menopausal transition is characterized by marked, and often dramatic, variations in FSH and estradiol levels. Because of this, measurements of these hormones are &quot;not&quot; considered to be reliable guides to a woman&#x27;s exact menopausal status.

Menopause occurs because of the sharp decrease of estradiol and progesterone production by the ovaries. After menopause, estrogen continues to be produced mostly by aromatase in fat tissues and is produced in small amounts in many other tissues such as ovaries, bone, blood vessels, and the brain where it acts locally. The substantial fall in circulating estradiol levels at menopause impacts many tissues, from brain to skin.

In contrast to the sudden fall in estradiol during menopause, the levels of total and free testosterone, as well as dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and androstenedione appear to decline more or less steadily with age. An effect of natural menopause on circulating androgen levels has not been observed. Thus specific tissue effects of natural menopause cannot be attributed to loss of androgenic hormone production.

Hot flashes and other vasomotor and body symptoms accompanying the menopausal transition are associated with estrogen insufficiency and changes that occur in the brain, primarily the hypothalamus and involve complex interplay between the neurotransmitters kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin, which are found in KNDy neurons in the infundibular nucleus.

=== Ovarian aging ===
Decreased inhibin feedback after hysterectomy is hypothesized to contribute to increased ovarian stimulation and earlier menopause. Hastened ovarian aging has been observed after endometrial ablation. While it is difficult to prove that these surgeries are causative, it has been hypothesized that the endometrium may be producing endocrine factors contributing to the endocrine feedback and regulation of the ovarian stimulation. Elimination of these factors contributes to faster depletion of the ovarian reserve. Reduced blood supply to the ovaries that may occur as a consequence of hysterectomy and uterine artery embolisation has been hypothesized to contribute to this effect.

Impaired DNA repair mechanisms may contribute to earlier depletion of the ovarian reserve during aging. As women age, double-strand breaks accumulate in the DNA of their primordial follicles. Primordial follicles are immature primary oocytes surrounded by a single layer of granulosa cells. An enzyme system is present in oocytes that ordinarily accurately repairs DNA double-strand breaks. This repair system is called &quot;homologous recombinational repair&quot;, and it is especially effective during meiosis. Meiosis is the general process by which germ cells are formed in all sexual eukaryotes; it appears to be an adaptation for efficiently removing damages in germ line DNA.

Human primary oocytes are present at an intermediate stage of meiosis, termed prophase I (see Oogenesis). Expression of four key DNA repair genes that are necessary for homologous recombinational repair during meiosis (BRCA1, MRE11, Rad51, and ATM) decline with age in oocytes. This age-related decline in ability to repair DNA double-strand damages can account for the accumulation of these damages, that then likely contributes to the depletion of the ovarian reserve.

== Diagnosis ==
Ways of assessing the impact on women of some of these menopause effects, include the Greene climacteric scale questionnaire, the Cervantes scale and the Menopause rating scale.

=== Perimenopause ===
The term &quot;perimenopause&quot;, which literally means &quot;around the menopause&quot;, refers to the menopause transition years before the date of the final episode of flow. According to the North American Menopause Society, this transition can last for four to eight years. The Centre for Menstrual Cycle and Ovulation Research describes it as a six- to ten-year phase ending 12 months after the last menstrual period.

During perimenopause, estrogen levels average about 20–30% higher than during premenopause, often with wide fluctuations. These fluctuations cause many of the physical changes during perimenopause as well as menopause, especially during the last 1–2 years of perimenopause (before menopause). Some of these changes are hot flashes, night sweats, difficulty sleeping, mood swings, vaginal dryness or atrophy, incontinence, osteoporosis, and heart disease. Perimenopause is also associated with a higher likelihood of depression (affecting from 45 percent to 68 percent of perimenopausal women), which is twice as likely to affect those with a history of depression.

During this period, fertility diminishes but is not considered to reach zero until the official date of menopause. The official date is determined retroactively, once 12 months have passed after the last appearance of menstrual blood.

The menopause transition typically begins between 40 and 50 years of age (average 47.5). The duration of perimenopause may be for up to eight years. Women will often, but not always, start these transitions (perimenopause and menopause) about the same time as their mother did.

Some research appears to show that melatonin supplementation in perimenopausal women can improve thyroid function and gonadotropin levels, as well as restoring fertility and menstruation and preventing depression associated with menopause.

=== Postmenopause ===
The term &quot;postmenopausal&quot; describes women who have not experienced any menstrual flow for a minimum of 12 months, assuming that they have a uterus and are not pregnant or lactating. The reason for this delay in declaring postmenopause is that periods are usually erratic during menopause. Therefore, a reasonably long stretch of time is necessary to be sure that the cycling has ceased. At this point a woman is considered infertile; however, the possibility of becoming pregnant has usually been very low (but not quite zero) for a number of years before this point is reached.

In women with or without a uterus, menopause or postmenopause can also be identified by a blood test showing a very high follicle-stimulating hormone level, greater than 25 IU/L in a random blood draw; it rises as ovaries become inactive. FSH continues to rise, as its counterpart estradiol continues to drop for about 2 years after the last menstrual period, after which the levels of each of these hormones stabilize. The stabilization period after the begin of early postmenopause has been estimated to last 3 to 6 years, so early postmenopause lasts altogether about 5 to 8 years, during which hormone withdrawal effects such as hot flashes disappear. Finally, late postmenopause has been defined as the remainder of a woman s lifespan, when reproductive hormones do not change any more.

A period-like flow during postmenopause, even spotting, may be a sign of endometrial cancer.

== Management ==
Perimenopause is a natural stage of life. It is not a disease or a disorder. Therefore, it does not automatically require any kind of medical treatment. However, in those cases where the physical, mental, and emotional effects of perimenopause are strong enough that they significantly disrupt the life of the woman experiencing them, palliative medical therapy may sometimes be appropriate.

=== Menopausal hormone therapy ===

In the context of the menopause, menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the use of estrogen in women without a uterus and estrogen plus progestogen in women who have an intact uterus.

MHT may be reasonable for the treatment of menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes. It is the most effective treatment option, especially when delivered as a skin patch. Its use, however, appears to increase the risk of strokes and blood clots. When used for menopausal symptoms the global recommendation is MHT should be prescribed for a long as there are defined treatment effects and goals for the individual woman.

MHT is also effective for preventing bone loss and osteoporotic fracture, but it is generally recommended only for women at significant risk for whom other therapies are unsuitable.

MHT may be unsuitable for some women, including those at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, increased risk of thromboembolic disease (such as those with obesity or a history of venous thrombosis) or increased risk of some types of cancer. There is some concern that this treatment increases the risk of breast cancer. Women at increased risk of cardiometabolic disease and VTE may be able to use transdermal estradiol which does not appear to increase risks in low to moderate doses.

Adding testosterone to hormone therapy has a positive effect on sexual function in postmenopausal women, although it may be accompanied by hair growth or acne if used in excess. Transdermal testosterone therapy in appropriate dosing is generally safe.

=== Selective estrogen receptor modulators ===
SERMs are a category of drugs, either synthetically produced or derived from a botanical source, that act selectively as agonists or antagonists on the estrogen receptors throughout the body. The most commonly prescribed SERMs are raloxifene and tamoxifen. Raloxifene exhibits oestrogen agonist activity on bone and lipids, and antagonist activity on breast and the endometrium. Tamoxifen is in widespread use for treatment of hormone sensitive breast cancer. Raloxifene prevents vertebral fractures in postmenopausal, osteoporotic women and reduces the risk of invasive breast cancer.

=== Other medications ===
Some of the SSRIs and SNRIs appear to provide some relief from vasomotor symptoms. The most effective SSRIs and SNRIs are paroxetine, escitalopram, citalopram, venlafaxine, and desvenlafaxine. They may, however, be associated with appetite and sleeping problems, constipation and nausea.

Gabapentin or fezolinetant can also improve the frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms. Side effects of using gabapentin include drowsiness and headaches.

=== Therapy ===
Cognitive behavioural therapy and clinical hypnosis can decrease the amount women are affected by hot flashes. Mindfulness is not yet proven to be effective in easing vasomotor symptoms.

=== Lifestyle and exercise ===
Exercise has been thought to reduce postmenopausal symptoms through the increase of endorphin levels, which decrease as estrogen production decreases. However, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that exercise helps with the symptoms of menopause. Similarly, yoga has not been shown to be useful as a treatment for vasomotor symptoms.

However a high BMI is a risk factor for vasomotor symptoms in particular. Weight loss may help with symptom management.

There is no strong evidence that cooling techniques such as using specific clothing or environment control tools (for example fans) help with symptoms. Paced breathing and relaxation are not effective in easing symptoms.

=== Dietary supplements ===
There is no evidence of consistent benefit of taking any dietary supplements or herbal products for menopausal symptoms. These widely marketed but ineffective supplements include soy isoflavones, pollen extracts, black cohosh, omega-3 among many others.

=== Alternative medicine ===
There is no evidence of consistent benefit of alternative therapies for menopausal symptoms despite their popularity.

As of 2023, there is no evidence to support the efficacy of acupuncture as a management for menopausal symptoms. The Cochrane review found not enough evidence in 2016 to show a difference between Chinese herbal medicine and placebo for the vasomotor symptoms.

=== Other efforts ===
* Lack of lubrication is a common problem during and after perimenopause. Vaginal moisturizers can help women with overall dryness, and lubricants can help with lubrication difficulties that may be present during intercourse. It is worth pointing out that moisturizers and lubricants are different products for different issues: some women complain that their genitalia are uncomfortably dry all the time, and they may do better with moisturizers. Those who need only lubricants do well using them only during intercourse.
* Low-dose prescription vaginal estrogen products such as estrogen creams are generally a safe way to use estrogen topically, to help vaginal thinning and dryness problems (see vaginal atrophy) while only minimally increasing the levels of estrogen in the bloodstream.
* Individual counseling or support groups can sometimes be helpful to handle sad, depressed, anxious or confused feelings women may be having as they pass through what can be for some a very challenging transition time.
* Osteoporosis can be minimized by smoking cessation, adequate vitamin D intake and regular weight-bearing exercise. The bisphosphonate drug alendronate may decrease the risk of a fracture, in women that have both bone loss and a previous fracture and less so for those with just osteoporosis.
* A surgical procedure where a part of one of the ovaries is removed earlier in life and frozen and then over time thawed and returned to the body (ovarian tissue cryopreservation) has been tried. While at least 11 women have undergone the procedure and paid over £6,000, there is no evidence it is safe or effective.

== Society and culture ==

=== Attitudes and experiences ===
The menopause transition is a process, involving hormonal, menstrual, and typically vasomotor changes. However, the experience of the menopause as a whole is very much influenced by psychological and social factors, such as past experience, lifestyle, social and cultural meanings of menopause, and a woman&#x27;s social and material circumstances. Menopause has been described as a biopsychosocial experience, with social and cultural factors playing a prominent role in the way menopause is experienced and perceived.

The paradigm within which a woman considers menopause influences the way she views it: women who understand menopause as a medical condition rate it significantly more negatively than those who view it as a life transition or a symbol of aging. There is some evidence that negative attitudes and expectations, held before the menopause, predict symptom experience during the menopause, and beliefs and attitudes toward menopause tend to be more positive in postmenopausal than in premenopausal women. Women with more negative attitudes towards the menopause report more symptoms during this transition.

Menopause is a stage of life experienced in different ways. It can be characterized by personal challenges, changes in personal roles within the family and society. Women&#x27;s approaches to changes during menopause are influenced by their personal, family and sociocultural background. Women from different regions and countries also have different attitudes. Postmenopausal women had more positive attitudes toward menopause compared with peri- or premenopausal women. Other influencing factors of attitudes toward menopause include age, menopausal symptoms, psychological and socioeconomical status, and profession and ethnicity.

Ethnicity and geography play roles in the experience of menopause. American women of different ethnicities report significantly different types of menopausal effects. One major study found Caucasian women most likely to report what are sometimes described as psychosomatic symptoms, while African-American women were more likely to report vasomotor symptoms.

There may be variations in experiences of women from different ethnic backgrounds regarding menopause and care. Immigrant women reported more vasomotor symptoms and other physical symptoms and poorer mental health than non-immigrant women and were mostly dissatisfied with the care they had received. Self-management strategies for menopausal symptoms were also influenced by culture.

Two multinational studies of Asian women, found that hot flushes were not the most commonly reported symptoms, instead body and joint aches, memory problems, sleeplessness, irritability and migraines were. In another study comparing experiences of menopause amongst White Australian women and women in Laos, Australian women reported higher rates of depression, as well as fears of aging, weight gain and cancer – fears not reported by Laotian women, who positioned menopause as a positive event. Japanese women experience menopause effects, or &quot;kōnenki&quot; (更年期), in a different way from American women. Japanese women report lower rates of hot flashes and night sweats; this can be attributed to a variety of factors, both biological and social. Historically, &quot;kōnenki&quot; was associated with wealthy middle-class housewives in Japan, i.e., it was a &quot;luxury disease&quot; that women from traditional, inter-generational rural households did not report. Menopause in Japan was viewed as a symptom of the inevitable process of aging, rather than a &quot;revolutionary transition&quot;, or a &quot;deficiency disease&quot; in need of management. As of 2005, in Japanese culture, reporting of vasomotor symptoms has been on the increase, with research finding that of 140 Japanese participants, hot flashes were prevalent in 22.1%. This was almost double that of 20 years prior. Whilst the exact cause for this is unknown, possible contributing factors include dietary changes, increased medicalisation of middle-aged women and increased media attention on the subject. However, reporting of vasomotor symptoms is still &quot;significantly&quot; lower than in North America.

Additionally, while most women in the United States apparently have a negative view of menopause as a time of deterioration or decline, some studies seem to indicate that women from some Asian cultures have an understanding of menopause that focuses on a sense of liberation and celebrates the freedom from the risk of pregnancy. Diverging from these conclusions, one study appeared to show that many American women &quot;experience this time as one of liberation and self-actualization&quot;.

In some women, menopause may bring about a sense of loss related to the end of fertility. In addition, this change often aligns with other stressors, such as the responsibility of looking after elderly parents or dealing with the emotional challenges of &quot;empty nest syndrome&quot; when children move out of the family home. This situation can be accentuated in cultures where being older is negatively perceived.

=== Impact on work ===

Midlife is typically a life stage when men and women may be dealing with demanding life events and responsibilities, such as work, health problems, and caring roles. For example, in 2018 in the UK women aged 45–54 report more work-related stress than men or women of any other age group. Hot flashes are often reported to be particularly distressing at work and lead to embarrassment and worry about potential stigmatisation. A June 2023 study by the Mayo Clinic estimated an annual loss of $1.8 billion in the United States due to workdays missed as a result of menopause symptoms. This was one of the largest studies to date examining the impact of menopause symptoms on work outcomes. The research concluded there was a strong need to improve medical treatment for menopausal women and make the workplace environment more supportive to avoid such productivity losses.

=== Etymology ===
Menopause literally means the &quot;end of monthly cycles&quot; (the end of monthly periods or menstruation), from the Greek word &quot;pausis&quot; (&quot;pause&quot;) and &quot;mēn&quot; (&quot;month&quot;). This is a medical coinage; the Greek word for menses is actually different. In Ancient Greek, the menses were described in the plural, (&quot;the monthlies&quot;), and its modern descendant has been clipped to &quot;ta emmēna&quot;. The Modern Greek medical term is &quot;emmenopausis&quot; in Katharevousa or &quot;emmenopausi&quot; in Demotic Greek. The Ancient Greeks did not produce medical concepts about any symptoms associated with end of menstruation and did not use a specific word to refer to this time of a woman&#x27;s life. The word menopause was invented by French doctors at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Greek etymology was reconstructed at this time and it was the Parisian student doctor Charles-Pierre-Louis de Gardanne who invented a variation of the word in 1812, which was edited to its final French form in 1821.

Some of them noted that peasant women had no complaints about the end of menses, while urban middle-class women had many troubling symptoms. Doctors at this time considered the symptoms to be the result of urban lifestyles of sedentary behaviour, alcohol consumption, too much time indoors, and over-eating, with a lack of fresh fruit and vegetables.

The word &quot;menopause&quot; was coined specifically for female humans, where the end of fertility is traditionally indicated by the permanent stopping of monthly menstruations. However, menopause exists in some other animals, many of which do not have monthly menstruation; in this case, the term means a natural end to fertility that occurs before the end of the natural lifespan.

=== In popular culture, law and politics ===
In the 21st century, celebrities have spoken out about their experiences of the menopause, which has led to it becoming less of a taboo as it has boosted awareness of the debilitating symptoms. Subsequently, TV shows have been running features on the menopause to help women experiencing symptoms. In the UK Lorraine Kelly has been an advocate for getting women to speak about their experiences including sharing her own. This has led to an increase in women seeking treatment such as HRT. Davina McCall also led an awareness campaign based on a documentary on Channel 4.

In the UK, Carolyn Harris sponsored the Menopause (Support and Services) Bill in June 2021. It was to exempt hormone replacement therapy from National Health Service prescription charges and to make provisions about menopause support and services, including public education and communication in supporting perimenopausal and post-menopausal women, and to raise awareness of menopause and its effects. The bill was withdrawn on 29 October 2021.

In the US, David McKinley, Republican from West Virginia introduced the Menopause Research Act in September 2022 for $100 million in 2023 and 2024, but it stalled.

== Other animals ==
The majority of mammal species reach menopause when they cease the production of ovarian follicles, which contain eggs (oocytes), between one-third and two-thirds of their maximum possible lifespan. However, few live long enough in the wild to reach this point. Humans are joined by a limited number of other species in which females live substantially longer than their ability to reproduce. Examples of others include cetaceans: beluga whales, narwhals, orcas, false killer whales and short-finned pilot whales.

Menopause has been reported in a variety of other vertebrate species, but these examples tend to be from captive individuals, and thus are not necessarily representative of what happens in natural populations in the wild. Menopause in captivity has been observed in several species of nonhuman primates, including rhesus monkeys and chimpanzees. Some research suggests that wild chimpanzees do not experience menopause, as their fertility declines are associated with declines in overall health. Menopause has been reported in elephants in captivity and guppies. Dogs do not experience menopause; the canine estrus cycle simply becomes irregular and infrequent. Although older female dogs are not considered good candidates for breeding, offspring have been produced by older animals, see Canine reproduction. Similar observations have been made in cats.

Life histories show a varying degree of senescence; rapid senescing organisms (e.g., Pacific salmon and annual plants) do not have a post-reproductive life-stage. Gradual senescence is exhibited by all placental mammalian life histories.

== Evolution ==
There are various theories on the origin and process of the evolution of the menopause. These attempt to suggest evolutionary benefits to the human species stemming from the cessation of women&#x27;s reproductive capability before the end of their natural lifespan. It is conjectured that in highly social groups natural selection favors females that stop reproducing and devote that post-reproductive life span to continuing to care for existing offspring, both their own and those of others to whom they are related, especially their granddaughters and grandsons.

<doc id="49613" wikidata="Q52937" url="?curid=49613" title="Christina, Queen of Sweden">
<text>Christina (; 18 December O.S. 8 December] 1626 – 19 April 1689), a member of the House of Vasa, was Queen of Sweden from 1632 until her abdication in 1654. Her conversion to Catholicism and refusal to marry led her to relinquish her throne and move to Rome.

Christina is remembered as one of the most erudite women of the 17th century, wanting Stockholm to become the &quot;Athens of the North&quot; and was given the special right to establish a university at will by the Peace of Westphalia. She is also remembered for her unconventional lifestyle and occasional adoption of masculine attire, which have been depicted frequently in media; gender and cultural identity are pivotal themes in many of her biographies.

At the age of seven, Christina succeeded her father Gustavus Adolphus upon his death at the Battle of Lützen, though she only began ruling the Swedish Empire when she reached the age of eighteen. During the Torstenson War in 1644, she initiated the issuance of copper in lumps to be used as currency. Her lavish spending habits pushed the state towards bankruptcy, sparking public unrest. Christina argued for peace to end the Thirty Years&#x27; War and received indemnity. Following scandals over her not marrying and converting to Catholicism, she relinquished the throne to her cousin Charles X Gustav and settled in Rome.

Pope Alexander VII described Christina as &quot;a queen without a realm, a Christian without faith, and a woman without shame.&quot; She played a leading part in the theatrical and musical communities and protected many Baroque artists, composers, and musicians. Christina, who was the guest of five consecutive popes and a symbol of the Counter-Reformation, is one of the few women buried in the Vatican Grottoes.

==Early life==

Christina was born in the royal castle Tre Kronor. Her parents were the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus and his German wife, Maria Eleonora. They had already had three children: two daughters (a stillborn princess in 1621, then the first Princess Christina, who was born in 1623 and died the following year) and a stillborn son in May 1625. Excited expectations surrounded Maria Eleonora&#x27;s fourth pregnancy in 1626. When the baby was born, it was first thought to be a boy. It was &quot;hairy&quot; and screamed &quot;with a strong, hoarse voice.&quot; She later wrote in her autobiography that &quot;Deep embarrassment spread among the women when they discovered their mistake.&quot; The king, though, was very happy, saying, &quot;She&#x27;ll be clever, she has made fools of us all!&quot; Gustavus Adolphus was closely attached to his daughter, whereas her mother remained aloof in her disappointment at the child being a girl. In the year after Christina&#x27;s birth, Maria Eleonora was described as being in a state of hysteria owing to her husband&#x27;s absences. She showed little affection for her daughter and was not allowed any influence in Christina&#x27;s upbringing. The king was worried that her instability might pass on to their daughter.

The Crown of Sweden was hereditary in the House of Vasa, but following the reign of Christina&#x27;s grandfather (r. 1604–11), it excluded Vasa princes descended from a deposed brother (Eric XIV of Sweden) and a deposed nephew (Sigismund III of Poland). Gustavus Adolphus&#x27;s legitimate younger brothers had died years earlier. The one legitimate female left, his half-sister Catharine, came to be excluded in 1615 when she married John Casimir, Count Palatine of Kleeburg, a non-Lutheran. Christina became the undisputed heir presumptive. From Christina&#x27;s birth, King Gustav Adolphus recognized her eligibility even as a female heir, and although she was called &quot;queen,&quot; the official title the Riksdag gave at her coronation in February 1633 was &quot;king&quot;.

== Regency ==
In June 1630, when Christina was three years old, Gustavus Adolphus left for Germany to defend Protestantism and became involved in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. He secured his daughter&#x27;s right to inherit the throne, in case he never returned, and gave orders to Axel Gustafsson Banér, his marshal, that Christina should receive an education of the type normally only afforded to boys.

When Gustavus Adolphus did not come home as expected after the summer campaign of 1630, Maria wrote to John Casimir, her brother-in-law that she could not stand it; she wanted to die. She begged him to try to persuade the king to come home. It was decided that Maria would travel to Germany the following spring. She arrived on 10 July 1631, to Wolgast in Pomerania. On 11 January 1632, she met with her spouse near Hanau. The couple were spotted for the last time on 28 October 1632 at Erfurt. The very next day, Gustavus Adolphus broke camp and left. On 3 November, Maria wrote to Axel Oxenstierna: &quot;without H.R.M.&#x27;s presence, I am worth nothing, not even my life.&quot;

Her mother, of the House of Hohenzollern, was said to be the most beautiful queen in Europe, but she was also considered hysterical, unstable and overly emotional. It is suggested that she inherited madness, from both the paternal and maternal lines. However, this image of the hysterical, depressive and profligate queen dowager, which has become part of historiography, has been put into perspective in more recent research, first in the 1980s by the archivist Åke Kromnov, among others, and more recently in the monograph &quot;Drottningen som sa nej&quot; by Moa Matthis, published in 2010.

After the king died on the battlefield on 6 November 1632, Maria Eleonora returned to Sweden with the embalmed body of her husband. The 7-year-old Queen Christina came in solemn procession to Nyköping to receive her mother. Maria Eleonora declared that the burial should not take place during her lifetime - she often spoke of shortening her life - or at least should be postponed as long as possible. She also demanded that the coffin be kept open and went to see it regularly, patting it and taking no notice of the putrefaction. They tried to persuade Maria not to visit the corpse so often. Axel Oxenstierna managed to have the corpse interred in Riddarholmen Church on 22 June 1634, but had to post guards after she tried to dig it up.

Maria Eleanora had been indifferent to her daughter, but after Gustavus Adolphus&#x27;s death, Christina became the center of her mother&#x27;s attention. Gustavus Adolphus had decided that in the event of his death, his daughter should be cared for by his half-sister, Catherine of Sweden and half-brother Carl Gyllenhielm as regent. This solution did not suit Maria Eleonora, who had her sister-in-law banned from the castle. In 1634, the Instrument of Government, a new constitution, was introduced by Oxenstierna. The constitution stipulated that the &quot;King&quot; must have a Privy Council, which Oxenstierna himself headed.
Maria Eleonora was considered very difficult, and in 1636 she lost her parental rights to her daughter. The Riksråd justified its decision by asserting that she neglected Christina and her upbringing and that she had a bad influence on her daughter. Chancellor Oxenstierna saw no other solution than to exile the widow to Gripsholm castle, while the governing regency council would decide when she was allowed to see her daughter. For the subsequent years, Christina thrived in the company of her aunt Catherine and her family.

In 1638, after the death of her aunt and foster mother, the Royal Regency Council under Axel Oxenstierna saw the need to appoint a new foster mother to the underage monarch, which resulted in a reorganization of the queen&#x27;s household. To prevent the young queen from being dependent upon a single individual and favorite mother figure, the Royal Council decided to split the office of head lady-in-waiting (responsible for the queen&#x27;s female courtiers) and the office royal governess (or foster-mother) in four, with two women appointed to share each office. Accordingly, Ebba Leijonhufvud and Christina Natt och Dag were appointed to share the position of royal governess and foster mother with the title &quot;Upptuktelse-Förestånderska&quot; (&#x27;Castigation Mistress&#x27;), while Beata Oxenstierna and Ebba Ryning were appointed to share the position of head lady-in-waiting, all four with the formal rank and title of &quot;Hovmästarinna&quot;.

The Royal Council&#x27;s method of giving Queen Christina several foster mothers to avoid her forming an attachment to a single person appears to have been effective, as Christina did not mention her foster mothers directly in her memoirs and did not seem to have formed an attachment to any of them; in fact, with only a few exceptions, including Ebba Sparre, Lady Jane Ruthven and Louise van der Nooth, Christina did not show any interest in any of her female courtiers. She generally mentions them in her memoirs only to compare herself favorably toward them by referring to herself as more masculine than they.

Christina was educated as a royal male would have been. The theologian Johannes Matthiae Gothus became her tutor; he gave her lessons in religion, philosophy, Greek and Latin. Chancellor Oxenstierna taught her politics and discussed Tacitus with her. Oxenstierna proudly wrote of the 14-year-old girl that &quot;she is not at all like a female&quot; and had &quot;a bright intelligence.&quot; Christina seemed happy to study ten hours a day. Besides Swedish and German, she learned at least six more languages: Dutch, Danish, French, Italian, Arabic and Hebrew.

==Reign==
In 1644, at the age of 18, Christina was declared an adult, although the coronation was postponed because of the Torstenson War. She was visited by a group of Dutch diplomats, including Johan de Witt, to find a solution for the Sound Dues. In the Treaty of Brömsebro, signed at a creek in Blekinge, Denmark added the isles of Gotland and Ösel to Christina&#x27;s domain while Norway lost the districts of Jämtland and Härjedalen to her. Under Christina&#x27;s rule, Sweden, virtually controlling the Baltic Sea, had unrestricted access to the North Sea and was no longer encircled by Denmark–Norway.

Chancellor Oxenstierna soon discovered that her political views differed from his own. In 1645, he sent his son, Johan Oxenstierna, to the Peace Congress in the Westphalian city of Osnabrück, to argue against peace with the Holy Roman Empire. Christina, however, wanted peace at any cost and sent her own delegate, Johan Adler Salvius.

The Peace of Westphalia was signed in October 1648, effectively ending the European wars of religion. Sweden received an indemnity of five million thalers, used primarily to pay its troops. Sweden further received Western Pomerania (henceforth Swedish Pomerania), Wismar, the Archbishopric of Bremen, and the Bishopric of Verden as hereditary fiefs, thus gaining a seat and vote in the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire and in the respective diets (&quot;Kreistage&quot;) of three Imperial Circles: the Upper Saxon Circle, Lower Saxon Circle, and Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Circle; the city of Bremen was disputed.

Shortly before the conclusion of the peace settlement, she admitted Salvius into the council, against Oxenstierna&#x27;s wishes. Salvius was no aristocrat, but Christina wanted the opposition to the aristocracy present. In 1649, with the help of her uncle, John Casimir, Christina tried to reduce the influence of Oxenstierna when she declared her cousin Charles Gustav as her heir presumptive. The following year, Christina resisted demands from the other estates (clergy, burghers, and peasants) in the Riksdag of the Estates for the reduction of the number of noble landholdings that were tax-exempt. She never implemented such a policy. In 1649, Louis de Geer founded the Swedish Africa Company and in 1650, Christina hired Hendrik Carloff to improve trade on the Gold Coast. Her reign also saw the founding of the colony of New Sweden in 1638; it lasted until 1655.

===Patronage of the arts===

Christina has been described as the &quot;Minerva of the North&quot; due to her strong support of arts and academics. In 1645, Christina invited Hugo Grotius, the author of &quot;Mare Liberum&quot;, to become her librarian, but he died on his way in Rostock. That same year she founded &quot;Ordinari Post Tijdender&quot; (&quot;Regular Mail Times&quot;), the oldest currently published newspaper in the world. In 1647, Johann Freinsheim was appointed as her librarian. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Swedish troops looted books from conquered territories and dispatched them to Sweden to win favour with Christina. After the Battle of Prague (1648), when her armies looted Prague Castle, many of the treasures collected by Rudolph II were brought back to Stockholm. Thus, Christina acquired a number of valuable illustrated works and rare manuscripts for her library. The inventory drawn up at the time mentions 100 &quot;an allerhand Kunstbüchern&quot; (&quot;a hundred art books of different kinds&quot;), among them two world-famous manuscripts: the and the .

In 1649, 760 paintings, 170 marble and 100 bronze statues, 33,000 coins and medallions, 600 pieces of crystal, 300 scientific instruments, manuscripts, and books (including the by Rabanus Maurus) were transported to Stockholm. The art, from Prague Castle, had belonged to Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor and had been captured by Hans Christoff von Königsmarck during the Battle of Prague and the negotiations of the Peace of Westphalia. By 1649–1650, &quot;her desire to collect men of learning round her, as well as books and rare manuscripts, became almost a mania&quot;, Goldsmith wrote. To catalog her new collection she asked Isaac Vossius to come to Sweden and Heinsius to purchase more books on the market.

Her ambitions naturally demanded a wide-ranging correspondence. Not infrequently, she sat and wrote far into the night while the servants came and went with new wax candles. The &quot;Semiramis from the North&quot; corresponded with Pierre Gassendi, her favorite author. Blaise Pascal offered her a copy of his pascaline. She had a firm grasp of classical history and philosophy. Christina studied Neostoicism, the Church Fathers, and Islam; she systematically looked for a copy of the &quot;Treatise of the Three Impostors&quot;, a work bestowing doubt on all organized religion. In 1651, the kabbalist Menasseh ben Israel offered to become her agent or librarian for Hebrew books and manuscripts; they discussed his messianic ideas as he had recently spelled them out in his latest book, &quot;Hope of Israel&quot;. Other illustrious scholars who came to visit were Claude Saumaise, Johannes Schefferus, Olaus Rudbeck, Johann Heinrich Boeckler, Gabriel Naudé, Christian Ravis, Nicolaas Heinsius and Samuel Bochart, together with Pierre Daniel Huet and Marcus Meibomius, who wrote a book about Greek dance.

Christina was interested in theatre, especially the plays of Pierre Corneille; she was herself an amateur actress. From 1638 Oxenstierna employed a French ballet troupe under Antoine de Beaulieu, who also had to teach Christina to move around more elegantly. In 1647, the Italian architect Antonio Brunati was ordered to build a theatrical setting in one of the larger rooms of the palace. In 1648, she commissioned 35 paintings from Jacob Jordaens for a ceiling in Uppsala Castle. The court poet Georg Stiernhielm wrote several plays in the Swedish language, such as &quot;Den fångne Cupido eller Laviancu de Diane&quot;, performed with Christina taking the main part of the goddess Diana. She invited foreign companies to play at Bollhuset. An Italian opera troupe visited in 1652 with Vincenzo Albrici and Angelo Michele Bartolotti, a guitarist. A Dutch theater troupe with Ariana Nozeman and Susanna van Lee visited her in 1653. Among the French artists she employed was Anne Chabanceau de La Barre, who was made court singer.

===Descartes===
In 1646, Christina&#x27;s good friend, the French ambassador Pierre Chanut, met and corresponded with the philosopher René Descartes, asking him for a copy of his &quot;Meditations&quot;. Upon showing the queen some of the letters, Christina became interested in beginning a correspondence with Descartes. She invited him to Sweden, but Descartes was reluctant until she asked him to organize a scientific academy. Christina sent a ship to pick up the philosopher and 2,000 books. Descartes arrived on 4 October 1649. He resided with Chanut and finished his &quot;Passions of the Soul&quot;. It is highly unlikely Descartes wrote a &quot;Ballet de la Naissance de la Paix,&quot; performed on her birthday. On the day after, 19 December 1649, he probably started his private lessons for the queen. With Christina&#x27;s strict schedule, he was invited to the cold and draughty castle at 5:00 am daily to discuss philosophy and religion. Soon, it became clear they did not like each other; she disapproved of his mechanical view, and he did not appreciate her interest in Ancient Greek. On 15 January Descartes wrote he had seen Christina only four or five times. On 1 February 1650, Descartes caught a cold. He died ten days later, early in the morning of 11 February 1650, and according to Chanut, the cause of his death was pneumonia.

===Marriage issue===

By the age of nine, Christina was already impressed by the Catholic religion and the merits of celibacy. She read a biography of the virgin queen Elizabeth I of England with interest. But Christina understood that she was expected to provide an heir to the Swedish throne. Her first cousin Charles was infatuated with her, and they became secretly engaged before he left in 1642 to serve in the Swedish army in Germany for three years. Christina revealed in her autobiography that she felt &quot;an insurmountable distaste for marriage&quot; and &quot;for all the things that females talked about and did.&quot; She once stated, &quot;It takes more courage to marry than to go to war.&quot; As she was chiefly occupied with her studies, she slept three to four hours a night, forgot to comb her hair, donned her clothes in a hurry and wore men&#x27;s shoes for the sake of convenience. (In fact, her permanent bed-head became her trademark look in paintings.) When Christina left Sweden, she continued to write passionate letters to her intimate friend Ebba Sparre, in which she told her that she would always love her. However, such emotional letters were relatively common at that time, and Christina would use the same style when writing to women she had never met but whose writings she admired. 

===Coronation===
Christina&#x27;s coronation took place on 22 October 1650. Christina went to the castle of Jacobsdal, where she boarded a coronation carriage draped in black velvet embroidered in gold and pulled by three white horses. The procession to Storkyrkan was so long that when the first carriages arrived, the last ones had not yet left Jacobsdal (a distance of roughly 10.5 km or 6.5 miles). All four estates were invited to dine at the castle. Fountains at the marketplace splashed out wine for three days, a whole roast ox was served, and illuminations sparkled, followed by a themed parade (&quot;The Illustrious Splendors of Felicity&quot;) on 24 October.

=== Religion and health ===
Her tutor, Johannes Matthiae, influenced by John Dury and Comenius, who since 1638 had been working on a new Swedish school system, represented a gentler attitude than most Lutherans. In 1644, he suggested a new church order, but it was voted down as this was interpreted as Crypto-Calvinism. Queen Christina defended him against the advice of Chancellor Oxenstierna, but three years later, the proposal had to be withdrawn. In 1647, the clergy wanted to introduce the Book of Concord () – a book defining correct Lutheranism versus heresy, making some aspects of free theological thinking impossible. Matthiae was strongly opposed to this and was again backed by Christina. The Book of Concord was not introduced.

In 1651, after reigning for almost twenty years, working at least ten hours a day, Christina had a nervous breakdown or burnout. For an hour, she seemed to be dead. She suffered from high blood pressure and complained about bad eyesight and her crooked back. She had already seen many court physicians. In February 1652, the French doctor Pierre Bourdelot arrived in Stockholm. Unlike most doctors of that time, he held no faith in blood-letting; instead, he ordered sufficient sleep, warm baths, and healthy meals, in contrast to Christina&#x27;s hitherto ascetic way of life. She was only twenty-five; and advising that she should take more pleasure in life, Bourdelot asked her to stop studying and working so hard and to remove the books from her apartments.

For years, Christina knew by heart all the poems from the Ars Amatoria and was keen on the works by Martial and Petronius. The physician showed her the 16 erotic sonnets of Pietro Aretino, which he kept secretly in his luggage. By subtle means, Bourdelot undermined her principles. Having been Stoic, she now became an Epicurean. Her mother and de la Gardie were very much against the activities of Bourdelot and tried to convince her to change her attitude towards him; Bourdelot returned to France in 1653 &quot;laden in riches and curses&quot;.

The Queen had long conversations about Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Francis Bacon, and Kepler with Antonio Macedo, secretary and interpreter for Portugal&#x27;s ambassador. Macedo was a Jesuit, and in August 1651, smuggled on his person a letter from Christina to his general in Rome. In reply, Paolo Casati and Francesco Malines, trained in both natural sciences and theology, came to Sweden in the spring of 1652. She had more conversations with them, being interested in Catholic views on sin, the immortality of the soul, rationality, and free will. The two scholars revealed her plans to Cardinal Fabio Chigi. Around May 1652 Christina, raised in the Lutheran Church of Sweden, decided to become Catholic. She sent Matthias Palbitzki to Madrid and King Philip IV of Spain sent the diplomat Antonio Pimentel de Prado to Stockholm in August.

== Abdication ==

On 26 February 1649, Christina announced that she had decided not to marry and instead wanted her first cousin Charles Gustav to be heir to the throne. While the nobility objected to this, the three other estates – clergy, burghers, and peasants – accepted it. She agreed to stay on the condition the councils never again asked her to marry. In 1651, Christina lost much of her popularity after the beheading of Arnold Johan Messenius, together with his 17-year-old son, who had accused her of serious misbehavior and of being a &quot;Jezebel&quot;. According to them &quot;Christina was bringing everything to ruin, and that she cared for nothing but sport and pleasure.&quot;

In 1653, she founded the Amaranten order. Antonio Pimentel was appointed as its first knight; all members had to promise not to marry (again). In the same year, she ordered Vossius (and Heinsius) to make a list of about 6,000 books and manuscripts to be packed and shipped to Antwerp. In February 1654, she plainly told the Council of her plans to abdicate. Oxenstierna told her she would regret her decision within a few months. In May, the Riksdag discussed her proposals. She had asked for 200,000 &quot;rikstalers&quot; a year but received dominions instead. Financially she was secured through a pension and revenue from the town of Norrköping, the isles of Gotland, Öland, Ösel, and Poel, Wolgast and Neukloster in Mecklenburg, and estates in Pomerania. 

Her plan to convert was not the only reason for her abdication, as there was increasing discontent with her arbitrary and wasteful ways. Within ten years, she and Oxenstierna had created 17 counts, 46 barons, and 428 lesser nobles. To provide these new peers with adequate appanages, they had sold or mortgaged crown property representing an annual income of 1,200,000 rikstalers. During the ten years of her reign, the number of noble families increased from 300 to about 600, rewarding people such as Lennart Torstenson, Louis De Geer and Johan Palmstruch for their efforts. These donations took place with such haste that they were not always registered, and on some occasions, the same piece of land was given away twice.

Christina abdicated her throne on 6 June 1654 in favor of Charles Gustav. During the abdication ceremony at Uppsala Castle, Christina wore her regalia, which were ceremonially removed from her, one by one. Per Brahe, who was supposed to remove the crown, did not move, so she had to take the crown off herself. Dressed in a simple white taffeta dress, she gave her farewell speech with a faltering voice, thanked everyone, and left the throne to Charles X Gustav, who was dressed in black. Per Brahe felt that she &quot;stood there as pretty as an angel.&quot; Charles Gustav was crowned later on that day. Christina left the country within a few days.

==Departure and exile==
In the summer of 1654, Christina left Sweden in men&#x27;s clothing with the help of Bernardino de Rebolledo and rode as Count Dohna through Denmark. Relations between the two countries were still so tense that a former Swedish queen could not have traveled safely in Denmark. Christina had already packed and shipped abroad valuable books, paintings, statues, and tapestries from her Stockholm castle, leaving its treasures severely depleted.

Christina visited Frederick III, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp and, while there, thought that her successor should have a bride. She sent letters recommending two of the Duke&#x27;s daughters to Charles. Based on this recommendation, he married Hedwig Eleonora. On 10 July Christina arrived in Hamburg and stayed with Jacob Curiel at Krameramtsstuben.
Christina visited Johann Friedrich Gronovius, and Anna Maria van Schurman in the Dutch Republic.

In August, she arrived in the Southern Netherlands and settled down in Antwerp. For four months Christina was lodged in the mansion of a Jewish merchant. She was visited by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria; the Prince de Condé, the ambassador Pierre Chanut, as well as the former governor of Norway, Hannibal Sehested. In the afternoons, she went for a ride, and each evening, parties were held; there was always a play to watch or music to listen to. Christina quickly ran out of money and had to sell some of her tapestries, silverware, and jewelry. When her financial situation did not improve, the archduke invited her to his Brussels palace on Coudenberg. On 24 December 1654, she converted to the Catholic faith in the archduke&#x27;s chapel in the presence of the Dominican Juan Guêmes, Raimondo Montecuccoli and Pimentel. Baptized as Kristina Augusta, she adopted the name Christina Alexandra. She did not declare her conversion in public, in case the Swedish council might refuse to pay her alimony. In addition, Sweden was preparing for war against Pomerania, which meant that her income from there was considerably reduced. The pope and Philip IV of Spain could not support her openly either, as she was not publicly a Catholic yet. Christina succeeded in arranging a major loan, leaving books and statues to settle her debts.

In September, she left for Italy with her entourage of 255 persons and 247 horses. The pope&#x27;s messenger, the librarian Lucas Holstenius, himself a convert, waited for her in Innsbruck. On 3 November 1655, Christina announced her conversion to Catholicism in the Hofkirche and wrote to Pope Alexander VII and her cousin Charles X about it. To celebrate her official conversion, , an opera by Antonio Cesti, was performed. Ferdinand Charles, Archduke of Austria, already in financial trouble, is said to have been almost ruined by her visit. Her departure was on 8 November.

=== Setting off to Rome ===
The southbound journey through Italy was planned in detail by the Vatican and included brilliant triumphs in Ferrara, Bologna, Faenza and Rimini. In Pesaro, Christina became acquainted with the handsome brothers Santinelli, who so impressed her with their poetry and adeptness of dancing that she took them into service, as well as a certain Gian Rinaldo Monaldeschi. The official entry into Rome took place on 20 December, in a sedan chair designed by Bernini through Porta Flaminia, which today is known as Porta del Popolo. Christina met Bernini on the next day, she invited him to her apartment the same evening and they became lifelong friends. &quot;Two days afterwards she was conducted to the Vatican Basilica, where the pope gave her confirmation. It was then that she received from the pope her second name of Alexandra, the feminine form of his own.&quot; She was granted her own wing inside the Vatican, decorated by Bernini.

Christina&#x27;s visit to Rome was the triumph of Pope Alexander VII and the occasion for splendid Baroque festivities. For several months, she was the only preoccupation of the Pope and his court. The nobles vied for her attention and treated her to a never-ending round of fireworks, jousts, mock duels, acrobatics, and operas. On 31 January &quot;Vita Humana&quot; an opera by Marco Marazzoli was performed. At the Palazzo Barberini, where she was welcomed on 28 February by a few hundred privileged spectators, she watched an amazing carousel in the courtyard.

=== Palazzo Farnese ===
Christina finally settled down in the Palazzo Farnese, which belonged to the Duke of Parma. Every Wednesday she held the palace open to visitors from the higher classes who kept themselves busy with poetry and intellectual discussions. Christina opened an academy in the palace on 24 January 1656, called Academy of Arcadia, where the participants enjoyed music, theater, and literature. The poet Reyer Anslo was presented to her. Belonging to the Arcadia-circle was also Francesco Negri, a Franciscan from Ravenna who is regarded as the first tourist to visit North Cape, Norway. Another Franciscan was the Swede Lars Skytte, who, under the name pater Laurentius, served as Christina&#x27;s confessor for eight years.

Twenty-nine-year-old Christina gave occasion to much gossip when socializing freely with men her own age. One of them was Cardinal Decio Azzolino, who had been a secretary to the ambassador in Spain, and responsible for the Vatican&#x27;s correspondence with European courts. He was also the leader of the &quot;Squadrone Volante&quot;, the free-thinking &quot;Flying Squad&quot; movement within the Catholic Church. Christina and Azzolino were so close that the pope asked him to shorten his visits to her palace, but they remained lifelong friends. In a letter on 26 January 1676 to Azzolino Christina writes (in French) that she would never offend God or give Azzolino reason to take offense, but this &quot;does not prevent me from loving you until death, and since piety relieves you from being my lover, then I relieve you from being my servant, for I shall live and die as your slave.&quot; As he had promised to remain celibate, his replies were more reserved. In the meantime Christina learned that the Swedes had confiscated all her revenue as the princess had become a Catholic.
== Visits to France and Italy ==
King Philip IV of Spain ruled the Duchy of Milan and the Kingdom of Naples. The French politician Mazarin, an Italian himself, had attempted to liberate Naples from Spanish rule, against which the locals had fought before the Neapolitan Republic was created. A second expedition in 1654 had failed and the Duke of Guise gave up. Christina&#x27;s goal was to become a mediator between France and Spain in their contest to control Naples. Her plan detailed that she would lead French troops to take Naples and rule until bequeathing the crown to France after her death. Christina sent home all her Spanish servants, including her confidant Pimentel and her confessor Guêmes. On 20 July 1656 Christina set sail from Civitavecchia for Marseille where she arrived nine days later. In early August, she traveled to Paris, accompanied by the Duke of Guise. Mazarin gave her no official sponsorship but gave instructions that she be celebrated and entertained in every town on her way north.

On 8 September she arrived in Paris and was shown around; ladies were shocked by her masculine appearance and demeanor and the unguarded freedom of her conversation. When visiting the ballet with la Grande Mademoiselle, she, as the latter recalls, &quot;surprised me very much – applauding the parts which pleased her, taking God to witness, throwing herself back in her chair, crossing her legs, resting them on the arms of her chair, and assuming other postures, such as I had never seen taken but by Travelin and Jodelet, two famous buffoons... She was in all respects a most extraordinary creature&quot;.

Christina was treated with respect by the young Louis XIV and his mother, Anne of Austria, in Compiègne. On 22 September 1656, the arrangement between her and Louis XIV was ready. He would recommend Christina as queen to the Kingdom of Naples and serve as guarantor against Spanish aggression. As Queen of Naples, she would be financially independent of the Swedish king, and also capable of negotiating peace between France and Spain.

On her way back Christina visited French courtesan and author Ninon de l&#x27;Enclos in the convent at Lagny-sur-Marne. In early October, she left France and arrived in Torino. During the winter Christina lived in the apostolic palace in Pesaro, probably to flee the plague which infested several regions including Naples. During the Naples Plague (1656) almost half of the population died within two years. In July 1657, she returned to France, either being impatient or not so anxious to become queen of Naples. 

=== The death of Monaldeschi ===

On 15 October 1657 apartments were assigned to her at the Palace of Fontainebleau, where she committed an action that stained her memory: the execution of marchese Gian Rinaldo Monaldeschi, her master of the horse and formerly leader of the French party in Rome. For two months she had suspected Monaldeschi of disloyalty; she secretly seized his correspondence, which revealed that he had betrayed her interests. Christina gave three packages of letters to Le Bel, a priest, to keep them for her in custody. Three days later, at one o&#x27;clock on Saturday afternoon, she summoned Monaldeschi into the &quot;Galerie des Cerfs&quot;, discussing the matter and letters with him. He insisted that betrayal should be punished with death. She was convinced that he had pronounced his own death sentence. After an hour or so Le Bel was to receive his confession. Both Le Bel and Monaldeschi entreated for mercy, but he was stabbed by her domestics – notably Ludovico Santinelli – in his stomach and in his neck. Wearing his coat of mail, which protected him, he was chased around in an adjacent room before they finally succeeded in dealing him a fatal wound in his throat. &quot;In the end, he died, confessing his infamy and admitting [Santinelli&#x27;s] innocence, protesting that he had invented the whole fantastic story in order to ruin [him].&quot;

Father Le Bel was told to have him buried inside the church, and Christina, seemingly unfazed, paid an abbey to say a number of Masses for his soul. She &quot;was sorry that she had been forced to undertake this execution, but claimed that justice had been carried out for his crime and betrayal.

Mazarin, who had sent her old friend Chanut, advised Christina to place the blame due to a brawl among courtiers, but she insisted that she alone was responsible for the act. She wrote to Louis XIV who two weeks later paid her a friendly visit without mentioning it. In Rome, people felt differently; Monaldeschi had been an Italian nobleman, murdered by a foreign barbarian with Santinelli as one of her executioners. The letters proving his guilt are gone; Christina left them with Le Bel and only he confirmed that they existed. Christina never revealed what was in the letters, but according to Le Bel, it is supposed to have dealt with her &quot;amours&quot;, either with Monaldeschi or another person. She herself wrote her version of the story for circulation in Europe.

The killing of Monaldeschi in a French palace was legal, since Christina had judicial rights over the members of her court, as her vindicator Gottfried Leibniz claimed. As her contemporaries saw it, Christina as queen had to emphasize right and wrong, and her sense of duty was strong. She continued to regard herself as queen regnant all her life.

She would gladly have visited England, but she received no encouragement from Cromwell and stayed in Fontainebleau as nobody else offered her a place. Anne of Austria, the mother of Louis XIV, was impatient to be rid of her cruel guest; Christina had no choice but to depart. She returned to Rome and dismissed Santinelli in 1659, claiming to be her ambassador in Vienna without her approval.

== Back to Rome ==
On 15 May 1658, Christina arrived in Rome for the second time, but this time it was definitely no triumph. With the execution of Monaldeschi, her popularity was lost. Pope Alexander VII remained in his summer residence and wanted no further visits from her. He described her as &#x27;a woman born of a barbarian, barbarously brought up and living with barbarous thoughts ... with a ferocious and almost intolerable pride&#x27;. She began examining her past life and started with her autobiography. Christina stayed at the Palazzo Rospigliosi, which belonged to Mazarin, the French cardinal, situated close to the Quirinal Palace; so the pope was enormously relieved when in July 1659, she moved to Trastevere to live in Palazzo Riario, below the Janiculum, designed by Bramante. It was Cardinal Azzolino, her &quot;bookkeeper&quot; who signed the contract, as well as provided her with new servants to replace Francesco Santinelli, who had been Monaldeschi&#x27;s executioner.

The Riario Palace became her home for the rest of her life. She decorated the walls with tapestries by Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi and paintings, mainly from the Venetian School and Renaissance; and almost no paintings from northern European painters, except Holbein, Van Dyck and Rubens. Her collections included very little religious subject matter and an abundance of mythological imagery, and it seems that Christina was also much interested in classical history, prompting misbegotten academic speculation about the genuineness of her conversion. No Roman collection of art could match hers. She owned Correggio&#x27;s &quot;Danaë&quot; and two versions of Titian&#x27;s &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;, tapestries, sculpture, medaillons, drawings by Raphael, Michelangelo, Caravaggio, Titian, Veronese and Goltzius and portraits of her friends Azzolino, Bernini, Ebba Sparre, Descartes, ambassador Chanut and doctor Bourdelot.

== Revisiting Sweden ==
In April 1660 Christina was informed that Charles X Gustav had died in February. His son, Charles XI, was only five years old. That summer, she went to Sweden, pointing out that she had left the throne to her first cousin and his descendant, so if Charles XI died, she would take over the throne again. But as she was a Catholic that was impossible, and the clergy refused to let the priests in her entourage celebrate any Masses. Christina left Stockholm and went to Norrköping. Eventually she submitted to a second renunciation of the throne, spending a year in Hamburg to get her finances in order on her way back to Rome. Already in 1654, she had left her income to the banker Diego Teixeira in return for him sending her a monthly allowance and covering her debts in Antwerp. She visited the Teixeira family at Jungfernstieg and entertained them in her own lodgings.

In the summer of 1662, she arrived in Rome for the third time, followed by some fairly happy years. A variety of complaints and allegations made her resolve in 1666 once more to return to Sweden. She proceeded no farther than Norrköping, where she received a decree she was only allowed to settle in Swedish Pomerania. Christina immediately decided to go back to Hamburg. There she was informed that Alexander VII, her patron and tormentor, had died in May 1667. The new pope Clement IX, a victory for the Squadrone Volante, had been a regular guest at her palace. In her delight at his election, she threw a brilliant party at her lodgings in Hamburg, with illuminations and wine in the fountain outside. The party enraged Hamburg&#x27;s Lutheran populace, and the party ended in a shooting, an attempt to seize the Queen, and her escape in disguise through a back door. Again she met with the freethinker and eye doctor Giuseppe Francesco Borri.

On 16 September 1668, John II Casimir abdicated the Polish–Lithuanian throne and left to France. The Polish monarchy was elective and Christina, as a member of the House of Vasa, put herself forward as a candidate for the throne. She recommended herself being Catholic, an old maid and intended to remain one. She had Pope Clement IX&#x27;s support; but her failure seemed to please her since this meant that she could return to her beloved Azzolino. She left the city on 20 October 1668.

==Later life==

Christina&#x27;s fourth and last entry in Rome took place on 22 November 1668. Clement IX often visited her; they had a shared interest in plays. Christina organized meetings of the Accademia in the Great Hall which had ‘a platform for singers and players’. When the pope suffered a stroke, she was among the few he wanted to see at his deathbed. In 1671, Christina established Rome&#x27;s first public theatre in a former jail, Tor di Nona.

The new pope, Clement X, worried about the influence of theatre on public morals. When Innocent XI became pope, things turned even worse; within a few years he turned Christina&#x27;s theatre into a storeroom for grain, although he had been a frequent guest in her royal box with the other cardinals. He forbade women to perform with song or acting, and the wearing of decolleté dresses. Christina considered this sheer nonsense, and let women perform in her palace. In 1675, she invited António Vieira to become her confessor. Itinerant doctor Nicolaas Heinsius the Younger, the legitimized son of a former literatus at Christina&#x27;s court in Stockholm, arrived in Rome in 1679, converted and was appointed the Queen&#x27;s personal physician until about 1687, providing autobiographical material for his picaresque novel,&quot;The Delightful Adventures and Wonderful Life of Mirandor&quot; (1695). Christina wrote an unfinished autobiography, of which there are several drafts extant, essays on her heroes Alexander the Great, Cyrus the Great and Julius Cæsar, on art and music (“Pensées, L’Ouvrage du Loisir” and “Les Sentiments Héroïques”) and acted as patron to musicians and poets as Vincenzo da Filicaja. Carlo Ambrogio Lonati and Giacomo Carissimi were Kapellmeister; Lelio Colista luteplayer; Loreto Vittori and Marco Marazzoli singers and Sebastiano Baldini librettist. She had Alessandro Stradella and Bernardo Pasquini to compose for her; Arcangelo Corelli dedicated his first work, &quot;Sonata da chiesa opus 1&quot;, to her. On 2 February 1687 Corelli or Alessandro Scarlatti directed a tremendous orchestra performing a Pasquini cantata in praise for James II, England&#x27;s first Catholic monarch since Mary I to welcome Roger Palmer, 1st Earl of Castlemaine as the new ambassador to the Vatican, accompanied by the painter John Michael Wright, who knew Rome and spoke Italian.

In 1656, Christina appointed Carissimi as her &quot;maestro di cappella del concerto di camera&quot;. Lars Berglund has hypothesized that Christina&#x27;s early involvement with Italian music when still in Sweden, and in particular church music from Rome, &quot;was likely closely linked to Christina’s self-fashioning strategies and related to the precarious negotiations she was about to embark on as a result of her extraordinary decisions to abdicate, leave the country, convert to Catholicism, and settle in Papal Rome.&quot;

Christina&#x27;s politics and rebellious spirit persisted long after her abdication of power. When Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes, abolishing the rights of French Protestants (Huguenots), Christina wrote an indignant letter, dated 2 February 1686, directed at the French ambassador Cesar d&#x27;Estrees. Louis did not appreciate her views, but Christina was not to be silenced. In Rome, she made Pope Clement X prohibit the custom of chasing Jews through the streets during the carnival. On 15 August 1686, she issued a declaration that Roman Jews were under her protection, signed &quot;la Regina&quot; – the queen.

Christina remained very tolerant towards the beliefs of others all her life. She on her part felt more attracted to the views of the Spanish priest Miguel Molinos, whom she employed as a private theologian. He had been investigated by the Holy Inquisition for proclaiming that sin belonged to the lower sensual part of man and was not subject to man&#x27;s free will. Christina sent him food and hundreds of letters when he was locked up in Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo.

==Death and burial ==
In February 1689, the 62-year-old Christina fell seriously ill after a visit to the temples in Campania, and received the last rites. She suffered from diabetes mellitus. Christina seemed to recover, but in the middle of April she developed an acute streptococcus bacterial infection known as erysipelas, then contracted pneumonia and a high fever. On her deathbed, she sent the pope a message asking if he could forgive her insults. She died on 19 April 1689 in Palazzo Corsini at six in the morning.

Christina had asked for a simple burial in the Pantheon, Rome, but the pope insisted on her being displayed on a &quot;lit de parade&quot; for four days in the Riario Palace. She was embalmed, covered with white brocade, a silver mask, a gilt crown, and a scepter. &quot;The Queen wore a thin mantle, decorated with hundreds of crowns and fur bordered with ermine, under this a splendid garment in two pieces, thin gloves and drawers of knitted silk and a pair of elegant textile bootees&quot;. In similar fashion to the popes, her body was placed in three coffins – one of cypress, one of lead and finally one made of oak. The funeral procession on 2 May led from Santa Maria in Vallicella to St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, where she was buried within the Vatican Grottoes – one of only three women ever given this honor (the other two being Matilda of Tuscany and Maria Clementina Sobieska). Her intestines were placed in a high urn.

In 1702, Clement XI commissioned a monument for the queen, in whose conversion he vainly foresaw a return of her country to the Faith and to whose contribution towards the culture of the city he looked back with gratitude. This monument was placed in the body of the basilica and directed by the artist Carlo Fontana.

Christina had named Azzolino her sole heir to make sure her debts were settled, but he was too ill and worn out even to join her funeral, and died in June the same year. His nephew, Pompeo Azzolino, was his sole heir, and he rapidly sold off Christina&#x27;s art collections.

==Art collector==
Until 1649, when Christina was twenty-three, the Swedish royal art collection was unimpressive, with good tapestries but for paintings, little more than &quot;about a hundred works by minor German, Flemish, and Swedish painters&quot;. But in May 1649, the fabulous loot from the occupation of Prague Castle the previous year arrived, with the pick of the collection amassed by the obsessive collector Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor (1552–1612), one of the most important in Europe. Rudolf&#x27;s bulk purchases had included the famous collection of Emperor Charles V&#x27;s leading minister Cardinal Granvelle (1517–1586), which he had forced Granvelle&#x27;s nephew and heir to sell to him. Granvelle had been the &quot;greatest private collector of his time, the friend and patron of Titian and Leoni and many other artists&quot;.

Christina was entranced by her new possessions, and remained a keen collector for the rest of her life, and as a female art collector is only exceeded by Catherine the Great of Russia in the Early Modern period. Rudolf had collected old and contemporary works from both Italy and northern Europe, but it was the Italian paintings that excited Christina, and by her death, her collection contained relatively few northern works other than portraits.

Most of the Prague booty remained in Sweden after Christina&#x27;s departure for exile: she only took about 70 to 80 paintings with her, including about 25 portraits of her friends and family, and some 50 paintings, mostly Italian, from the Prague loot, as well as statues, jewels, 72 tapestries, and various other works of art. She was concerned that the royal collections would be claimed by her successor, and prudently sent them ahead to Antwerp in a ship in August 1653, almost a year before she abdicated, an early sign of her intentions.

Christina greatly expanded her collection during her exile in Rome, for example adding the five small Raphael predella panels from the Colonna Altarpiece, including the &quot;Agony in the Garden&quot; now reunited with the main panel in New York, which were bought from a convent near Rome. She was apparently given Titian&#x27;s &quot;Death of Actaeon&quot; by the greatest collector of the age, Archduke Leopold William of Austria, Viceroy in Brussels – she received many such gifts from Catholic royalty after her conversion, and gave some generous gifts herself, notably Albrecht Dürer&#x27;s panels of &quot;Adam&quot; and &quot;Eve&quot; to Philip IV of Spain (now Prado), likewise seven marble statues of the Muses she acquired from Hadrian&#x27;s villa in 1670. She also gave away two paintings by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, &quot;Dull Gret&quot; and &quot;The Cripples&quot; (now Louvre). In such ways, the balance of her collection shifted to Italian art.

The Riario Palace finally provided a suitable setting for her collection, and the &quot;Sala dei Quadri&quot; (&quot;Paintings Room&quot;) had her finest works, with thirteen Titians and eleven Veroneses, five Raphaels and several Correggios. Titian&#x27;s &quot;Venus Anadyomene&quot; was among them. &quot;Venus mourns Adonis&quot; by Veronese was from Prague, and is now back in Sweden (Nationalmuseum).
Christina liked to commission portraits of herself, friends, and also notable people she had not met, from 1647 sending David Beck, her Dutch court painter, to several countries to paint notabilities. She encouraged artists to study her collection, including the drawings, and exhibited some of her paintings, but apart from portraits she commissioned or bought few works by living painters, except for drawings. Sculptors did rather better, and Bernini was a friend, while others were commissioned to restore the large collection of classical sculpture which she had begun to assemble while still in Sweden.

On her death she left her collection to Cardinal Decio Azzolino, who himself died within a year, leaving the collection to his nephew, who sold it to Don Livio Odescalchi, commander of the Papal army, at which point it contained 275 paintings, 140 of them Italian. The year after Odescalchi&#x27;s death in 1713, his heirs began protracted negotiations with the great French connoisseur and collector Pierre Crozat, acting as intermediary for Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, from 1715 the Regent of France. The sale was finally concluded and the 123 paintings included in the sale were delivered in 1721, forming the core of the Orleans Collection, the paintings from which were mostly sold in London after the French Revolution, with many of them being on display in the National Gallery. The French experts complained that Christina had cut down several paintings to fit her ceilings, and had over-restored some of the best works, especially the Correggios, implicating Carlo Maratti.

At first, removing her collections from Sweden was seen as a great loss to the country; but in 1697, Stockholm castle burned down with the loss of almost everything inside, so they would have been destroyed if they had remained there. Today very few major works from her collection still remain in the country. The sculpture collection was sold to the King of Spain and mostly remains in Spanish museums and palaces. Her large and important library was bought by Alexander VIII for the Vatican Library, while most of the paintings ended up in France, as the core of the Orleans Collection – many remain together in the National Gallery of Scotland. 1700 drawings from her collection (among them works by Michelangelo (25) and Raphael) were acquired in 1790 by Willem Anne Lestevenon for the Teylers Museum in Haarlem, the Netherlands.

== Appearance ==


Historical accounts of Christina include regular reference to her physical features, mannerisms and style of dress. Christina was known to have a bent back, a deformed chest, and irregular shoulders. Some historians have speculated that references to her physical attributes may be over-represented in related historiography, thus giving the impression that this was of greater interest to her contemporaries than was actually the case. However, given how influential Christina became in her own era (especially for those in Rome), it is likely her style and mannerisms were at least of general interest to those around her, and this is reflected in many accounts. As a result of conflicting and unreliable accounts (some no better than gossip), the way in which Christina is described, even today, is a matter of debate.

According to Christina&#x27;s autobiography, the midwives at her birth first believed her to be a boy because she was &quot;completely hairy and had a coarse and strong voice&quot;. Such ambiguity did not end with her birth; Christina made cryptic statements about her &quot;constitution&quot; and body throughout her life. Christina also believed a wet nurse had carelessly dropped her to the floor when she was a baby. A shoulder bone broke, leaving one shoulder higher than the other for the rest of her life. A number of her contemporaries made reference to the differing height of her shoulders.

As a child, Christina&#x27;s mannerisms could probably best be described as those of a tomboy. Her father insisted she should receive &quot;the education of a prince&quot;, and some have interpreted this as acceptance, on the part of the king, that she had masculine features or that there was some form of gender ambiguity in her upbringing. She was educated as a prince and was taught (and enjoyed) fencing, horse riding and bear hunting. She was said to have preferred these masculine hobbies to more feminine ones.

As an adult, it was said that Christina &quot;walked like a man, sat and rode like a man, and could eat and swear like the roughest soldiers&quot;. Christina&#x27;s contemporary John Bargrave described her comportment in a similar fashion but said witnesses ascribed her style more to childishness or madness than masculinity. When she arrived in Rome in 1655, she had shaven her head and wore a big, dark wig. By 1665, according to Edward Browne, she regularly wore a velvet justacorps, cravat, and peruke (man&#x27;s wig).

While Christina may not have been alone in her own time for choosing masculine dress (Leonora Christina Ulfeldt, for example, was known for dressing the same way), she also had physical features some described as masculine. According to Henry II, Duke of Guise, &quot;she wears men&#x27;s shoes and her voice and nearly all her actions are masculine&quot;. When she arrived in Lyon, she again wore a toque and had styled her hair like that of a young man. It was noted that she also wore large amounts of powder and face cream. In one account she &quot;was sunburnt, and she looked like a sort of Egyptian street girl, very strange, and more alarming than attractive&quot;.

Living in Rome, she formed a close relationship with Cardinal Azzolino, which was controversial but symbolic of her attraction to relationships that were not typical for a woman of her era and station. She abandoned her manly clothes and took to wearing &quot;décolleté&quot; dresses so risqué that they drew a rebuke from the Pope. 

As an older woman, Christina&#x27;s style changed a little. François Maximilian Misson (visiting Rome in the spring of April 1688) wrote:
=== Gender ambiguity and sexuality ===
In her &quot;Autobiography&quot; (1681), Christina is flirting with her androgynous personality. The question of her sexuality has been debated, even as a number of modern biographers generally consider her to have been a lesbian, and her relationships with women were noted during her lifetime; Christina seems to have written passionate letters to Ebba Sparre, and Guilliet suggested a relationship between Christina and Gabrielle de Rochechouart de Mortemart, Rachel, a niece of Diego Teixeira, and the singer Angelina Giorgino. Some historians assert she maintained heterosexual, non-sexual, lesbian, or bisexual relationships during the course of her life depending on which source is consulted. According to Veronica Buckley, Christina was a &quot;dabbler&quot; who was &quot;painted a lesbian, a prostitute, a hermaphrodite, and an atheist&quot; by her contemporaries, though &quot;in that tumultuous age, it is hard to determine which was the most damning label&quot;. Christina wrote near the end of her life that she was &quot;neither Male nor Hermaphrodite, as some People in the World have pass&#x27;d me for&quot;.

Bargrave recounted that Christina&#x27;s relationship with Azzolino was both &quot;familiar&quot; (intimate) and &quot;amorous&quot; and that Azzolino had been sent (by the Pope) to Romania as punishment for maintaining it. Buckley, on the other hand, believed there was &quot;in Christina a curious squeamishness with regard to sex&quot; and that &quot;a sexual relationship between herself and Azzolino, or any other man, seems unlikely&quot;. Based on historical accounts of Christina&#x27;s physicality, some scholars believe that she may have been an intersex individual.

In 1965, these conflicting accounts led to an investigation of Christina&#x27;s remains. Physical anthropologist and anatomist Carl-Herman Hjortsjö, who undertook the investigation, explained: &quot;Our imperfect knowledge concerning the effect of intersex on the skeletal formation ... makes it impossible to decide which positive skeletal findings should be demanded upon which to base the diagnosis [of an intersex condition].&quot; Nevertheless, Hjortsjö speculated that Christina had reasonably typical female genitalia because it is recorded by her physicians Bourdelot and Macchiati that she menstruated. Hjortsjö&#x27;s osteological analysis of Christina&#x27;s skeleton led him to state that they were of a &quot;typically female&quot; structure.

Some of the symptoms could be due to polycystic ovary syndrome, a complex multi-endocrine disorder including hirsutism (male pattern/type hair growth) due to increased androgen hormone levels, and abdominal obesity due to the hormone insulin receptor defects. Buckley suggested that her low comprehension of the need for most social norms, little desire to act, dress, or do other social norms, and her preference to wear, act, and do only that which she deemed logically practical, point to her having a pervasive developmental disorder, such as autism.

=== Depictions ===
The complex character of Christina has inspired numerous plays, books, and operatic works, including:

==== 19th century ====
* Jacopo Foroni&#x27;s 1849 opera &quot;Cristina, regina di Svezia&quot; is based on the events surrounding her abdication. Operas based on her life include Alessandro Nini&#x27;s &quot;Cristina di Svezia&quot; (1840), Giuseppe Lillo&#x27;s &quot;Cristina di Svezia&quot; (1841), and Sigismond Thalberg&#x27;s &quot;Cristina di Svezia&quot; (1855)
* Finnish historical novelist Zacharias Topelius wrote in Swedish the allegorical story &quot;Stjärnornas Kungabarn&quot; (Royal Children of the Stars) - the first part, &quot;Nattens barn&quot; (Night&#x27;s Child, 1899) takes place during the reign of Queen Christina of Sweden.

==== 20th century ====
* August Strindberg&#x27;s play Kristina (1901) centers on the final day of her reign. It was adapted for radio, most famously by Sweden&#x27;s national radio in 1964. Sveriges Radio 1964 production of &quot;Kristina&quot;
* Christina&#x27;s life was fictionalized in the classic feature film &quot;Queen Christina&quot; (1933). This film, starring Greta Garbo, depicted a heroine whose life diverged considerably from that of the real Christina.
* In the Italian film &quot;Love and Poison&quot; (1950/52) Christina is played by actress Lois Maxwell.
* Kaari Utrio published &quot;Kartanonherra ja kaunis Kristin&quot; (1969).
* In &quot;The Abdication&quot; (1974), starring Liv Ullmann, Christina arrives in the Vatican and falls in love with cardinal Azzelino. The script was based on a play by Ruth Wolff.
* Herta J. Enevoldsen wrote two novels in Danish on her life, &quot;Heltekongens Datter&quot; (1975) and &quot;En Dronning Værdig&quot; (1976).

==== 21st century ====
* Laura Ruohonen wrote &quot;Queen C&quot; (2003), which presents a woman centuries ahead of her time who lives by her own rules.
* In Eric Flint&#x27;s alternative history 1632 series (begun in 2000) she is a major character.
* Comedian Jade Esteban Estrada portrayed her (2004) in the solo musical &quot;ICONS: The Lesbian and Gay History of the World&quot; Vol. 2.
*Michel Marc Bouchard&#x27;s 2012 play &quot;Christina, The Girl King&quot;, is a fictional depiction of Queen Christina&#x27;s short rule and her queer identity, adapted also for Mika Kaurismäki&#x27;s film in 2015 and for the Canadian French-language opera &quot;La reine-garçon&quot; in 2024; in the former Christina is played by Swedish actress Malin Buska, fictionalised as the lesbian lover of Countess Ebba Sparre.
* In 2019 she was featured as the leader of the Swedish civilization, Kristina, in the video game expansion pack Civilization VI: Gathering Storm. She was depicted as having a strong focus on culture and art.
* &quot;La Reine-garçon&quot;, an all-Canadian adaptation of Christina&#x27;s life into opera created by composer Julien Bilodeau and playwright Michel Marc Bouchard (2012&#x27;s &quot;Christina the Girl-King&quot;) was jointly commissioned by the Canadian Opera Company and L&#x27;opéra de Montréal.

=== Geography and Toponymy ===
In 1636–1637, Peter Minuit and Samuel Blommaert negotiated with the government to found New Sweden, the first Swedish colony in the New World where, in 1638, Minuit erected Fort Christina in what is now Wilmington, Delaware. The Christina River in Delware was also named after her.

In the state of Pennsylvania, the Queen Village neighborhood in Center City, Philadelphia is named for her.
*Kristiine District of Tallinn, Estonia.
*Kristinestad, Finland.

<doc id="49615" wikidata="Q2564704" url="?curid=49615" title="Kuru Kuru Kururin">
<text>is a puzzle video game developed by Eighting and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance (GBA). It was released in Japan on March 21, 2001, and in Europe and Australia on June 22 as a launch title. It was not released in North America until February 2016 via the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console service. &quot;Kuru Kuru Kururin&quot; is the first title in the &quot;Kururin&quot; series and was followed by two Japan-only sequels, &quot;Kururin Paradise&quot; and &quot;Kururin Squash!&quot;. The game was released on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack in February 2023.

==Gameplay==

The player controls a slowly spinning stick, and must maneuver it through a series of mazes without touching the walls. Infamously difficult, the single player offers several goals per course, while the 4 player (single cart) multiplayer pits players in a race for fastest clear times.

The game starts with simple training levels, in which players are told how to play and how to get around the first corners. After that, there are three levels in each stage, which get progressively harder and longer. The obstacles and the look of the levels (ice, cave, machine, etc.) vary between stages. Taking damage incurs a time penalty, and losing all lives results in failing the level, requiring the player to restart the level from the beginning. Beginners can play the levels on Easy mode, where the stick is only half of its usual size.

There is a mode called Challenge mode, which is a collection of smaller levels, usually involving only one or two corners or objects to dodge.

==Plot==
The story begins when Kururin&#x27;s brothers and sisters go missing, and it is up to him to find them. Kururin is initially unsure that he is up to the task because he has never left his home world before. Being the adventurous and helpful fellow he is, Kururin agrees to rescue his lost family. Teacher Hare trains Kururin in the art of controlling the Helirin, a stick-shaped helicopter that has a slow-spinning propeller. Piloting the Helirin through the different worlds will be a difficult task, but using Teacher Hare&#x27;s valuable lessons, Kururin bravely sets out on his adventure to rescue his lost family.

==Development==
&quot;Kuru Kuru Kururin&quot; was developed by the Japanese company Eighting and first announced at the Nintendo Space World 2000.

==Reception==

&quot;Kuru Kuru Kururin&quot; received mostly positive reviews from critics. It was praised for its simple yet addictive gameplay. Eurogamer rated the game a score of 9 out of 10 points. The reviewer lauded the game&#x27;s learning curve and stated that there would be no other puzzle game on the Game Boy Advance at the time that can &quot;rival &quot;Kuru Kuru Kururin&quot; for its sheer addictiveness and fun-value&quot;. Nintendo World Report, then known as Planet GameCube, gave &quot;Kuru Kuru Kururin&quot; the same score as Eurogamer and declared that it is &quot;simple enough that anyone can pick this game up and play&quot;. The reviewer praised the game&#x27;s multiplayer mode, which he described as &quot;an absolute blast&quot;, as well as its lasting appeal, but also commented that the &quot;cutesy&quot; characters and music would be a turn-off for &quot;a lot of people&quot;. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot rated &quot;Kuru Kuru Kururin&quot; 7.1 out of 10 and described its graphics as &quot;simple but effective&quot;. He stated that the game is &quot;excellent at filling up small periods of free time with its short, level-based nature&quot;. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; was less impressed by the game, rating it 5 out of 10. The reviewer declared the game to be &quot;extremely frustrating&quot; and said that it lacks &quot;the perfect simplicity&quot; of other puzzle games such as &quot;Mr. Driller&quot; and &quot;Tetris&quot;. Nonetheless, he also commented that the novel gameplay of &quot;Kuru Kuru Kururin&quot; &quot;will find many fans&quot; and that the multiplayer mode is &quot;unexpectedly brilliant&quot;.

==Legacy==
The first sequel, &quot;Kururin Paradise&quot;, was released in 2002 for the Game Boy Advance. It was released in Japan only, even though &quot;Kururin Paradise&quot; was previously showcased at E3 2002, the first time a &quot;Kururin&quot; game had been announced for the American market. Another sequel was also released only in Japan for the GameCube in 2004, entitled &quot;Kururin Squash!&quot;, which became the only title of the series to use 3D computer graphics, as well as to appear on a home console.

Several references to the &quot;Kururin&quot; series are made in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series. The Helirin makes a cameo appearance as a trophy in &quot;Melee&quot;, but is incorrectly referred to as &quot;Heririn&quot; in the American version. The Helirin later appears in &quot;Brawl&quot; as an Assist Trophy. Unlike most Assist Trophies, it doesn&#x27;t attack, but it becomes part of the stage, and can be used as a platform or a wall. Several other things in the &quot;Kururin&quot; series appear as Trophies and Stickers in the game.

<text>Susan Mary Cooper (born 23 May 1935) is an English author of children&#x27;s books. She is best known for &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot;, a contemporary fantasy series set in England and Wales, which incorporates British mythology such as the Arthurian legends and Welsh folk heroes. For that work, in 2012 she won the lifetime Margaret A. Edwards Award from the American Library Association, recognizing her contribution to writing for teens. In the 1970s two of the five novels were named the year&#x27;s best English-language book with an &quot;authentic Welsh background&quot; by the Welsh Books Council. In 2024, the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association named her the 40th Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master in recognition of her significant contributions to the literature of science fiction and fantasy.  

== Biography ==

Cooper was born in 1935 in Burnham, Buckinghamshire, to Ethel May (&quot;née&quot; Field) and her husband John Richard Cooper. Her father had worked in the reading room of the Natural History Museum until going off to fight in the Second World War, from which he returned with a wounded leg. He then pursued a career in the offices of the Great Western Railway. Her mother was a teacher of ten-year-olds and eventually became deputy head of a large school. Her younger brother Roderick also grew up to become a writer.

Cooper lived in Buckinghamshire until she was 21, when her parents moved to her grandmother&#x27;s village of Aberdyfi in Wales. She attended Slough High School and then earned a degree in English at Somerville College at the University of Oxford, where she was the first woman to edit the undergraduate newspaper &quot;Cherwell&quot;.

After graduating, she worked as a reporter for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; (London) under Ian Fleming and wrote in her spare time. During that period she began work on the series &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot; and finished her debut novel, the science fiction &quot;Mandrake&quot;, published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton in 1964.

Cooper emigrated to the United States in 1963 to marry Nicholas J. Grant, a professor of metallurgy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and a widower with three teenage children. She had two children with him, Jonathan Roderick Howard Grant (b. 1965) and Katharine Mary Grant (b. 1966; later Katharine Glennon). She then became a full-time writer, focusing on &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot; and on &quot;Dawn of Fear&quot; (1970), a novel based on her experiences of the Second World War. Eventually she wrote fiction for both children and adults, a series of picture books, film screenplays, and works for the stage.

Around the time of writing &quot;Seaward&quot; (1983), both of her parents died, and her marriage to Grant was dissolved.

In July 1996, she married the Canadian-American actor and her sometime co-author Hume Cronyn, the widower of Jessica Tandy. (Cronyn and Tandy had starred in the Broadway production of &quot;Foxfire&quot;, written by Cooper and Cronyn and staged in 1982.)

After Cronyn&#x27;s death in 2003, she moved back to Massachusetts, building a house facing the North River in Marshfield, and also living in Cambridge. The history of the Marshfield area was the basis for her 2013 book &quot;Ghost Hawk&quot;, in which the spirit of a Wampanoag, whose people were decimated by European disease, witnesses the transformation of Massachusetts by the Plymouth Colony. She is a member of First Parish Unitarian Universalist Church of Scituate.

Hollywood adapted &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot; (1973) as a film in 2007, &quot;The Seeker&quot;.
Before she saw the film, Cooper stated that she had requested some changes to it, but had received no response.
From 2006 to 2012, Cooper was on the Board of the National Children&#x27;s Book and Literacy Alliance (NCBLA), a US nonprofit organization that advocates for literacy, literature, and libraries.

In April 2017, Cooper gave the fifth annual Tolkien Lecture at Pembroke College, Oxford, speaking on the role of fantasy literature in contemporary society.

In 2019 she published &quot;The Shortest Day&quot;, based on her performance poem of the same title written for the Cambridge Christmas &quot;Revels&quot; in the 1970s.

==Awards==

For her lifetime contribution as a children&#x27;s writer, Cooper was U.S. nominee in 2002 for the biennial, international Hans Christian Andersen Award, the highest international recognition available to creators of children&#x27;s books.

The American Library Association&#x27;s Margaret A. Edwards Award recognises one writer and a particular body of work for &quot;significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature&quot;. Cooper won the award in 2012 citing the five Dark Is Rising novels, published 1965 to 1977. The citation observed, &quot;In one of the most influential epic high fantasies in literature, Cooper evokes Celtic and Arthurian mythology and masterly world-building in a high-stakes battle between good and evil, embodied in the coming of age journey of Will Stanton.&quot;

In 2024, the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association named her the 40th Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master in recognition of her significant contributions to the literature of science fiction and fantasy.

She has also been recognised for single books:
*1974, Newbery Honor (runner-up for the Medal), &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot; (1973 novel)
*1976, Newbery Medal, &quot;The Grey King&quot;

<doc id="49619" wikidata="Q298234" url="?curid=49619" title="Mercedes Lackey">
<text>Mercedes Ritchie Lackey (born June 24, 1950) is an American writer of fantasy novels. Many of her novels and trilogies are interlinked and set in the world of Velgarth, mostly in and around the country of Valdemar. Her Valdemar novels include interaction between human and non-human protagonists with many different cultures and social mores.

Her other main world is similar to Earth, but it includes clandestine populations of elves, mages, vampires, and other mythical beings. The &quot;Bedlam&#x27;s Bard&quot; books describe a young man with the power to work magic through music; the &quot;SERRAted Edge&quot; books are about racecar driving elves; and the &quot;Diana Tregarde&quot; thrillers center on a Wiccan who combats evil.

She has also published several novels re-working well-known fairy tales set in a mid-19th to early 20th century setting in which magic is real, although hidden from the mundane world. These novels explore issues of ecology, social class, and gender roles.

Lackey has published over 140 books and writes novels at a rate of 5.5 per year on average. She has been called one of the &quot;most prolific science fiction and fantasy writers of all time.&quot; In 2021, Lackey was named the 38th Damon Knight Grand Master.

==Background==
Lackey was born in Chicago. Her birth prevented her father from being called to serve in the Korean War.

She placed her meeting with science fiction at age 10 or 11, when she picked up her father&#x27;s copy of James H. Schmitz&#x27;s &quot;Agent of Vega&quot;. She then read Andre Norton&#x27;s &quot;Beast Master&quot; and &quot;Lord of Thunder&quot; and continued to read all of Norton&#x27;s works. Lackey had difficulties obtaining enough interesting books from the public library to sate her passion for reading. She wrote for herself but without real direction or purpose until she attended Purdue University. Lackey graduated from Purdue in 1972.

While at Purdue, she took a one-on-one class of English Literature Independent Studies with a professor who was a fellow science fiction fan. He helped her analyze books she enjoyed and then use that knowledge. Lackey then encountered fan fiction, which further encouraged her writing. She began publishing work in science fiction fanzines and then discovered filk and had some filk lyrics published by Off Centaur Publications.

==Professional sales==
Lackey submitted a story to &quot;Sword and Sorceress&quot;, then sold the rewritten story to &quot;Fantasy Book Magazine&quot;. Her first sale was to &quot;Friends of Darkover&quot;.

She met C. J. Cherryh through filk. Cherryh helped Lackey through 17 rewrites of &#x27;Arrows&#x27;. During this time, Marion Zimmer Bradley included Lackey&#x27;s short stories in an anthology, &quot;Friends of Darkover&quot;. Lackey claims to have been writing so much during this time that she had no social life at all. She divorced Tony Lackey, and eventually married Larry Dixon.

===Stance on fanfiction===
Despite getting her own start as a fanfiction author, she and her agent forbade fan fiction based on her own books for many years, whether distributed offline or online. Lackey stated on her website that this was due to the 1992 Marion Zimmer Bradley fan fiction affair, when a fan accused Bradley of copying the fan&#x27;s work, and demanded writing credit and remuneration. After several years, Lackey&#x27;s policy permitted offline fanfic, but only if the author got a release form from Mercedes Lackey that said the author acknowledged that they were using characters that belong to Mercedes Lackey and that the author&#x27;s work essentially became Mercedes Lackey&#x27;s property to prevent &quot;infringing on my right to make a living from my own imagination&quot;. As of 2009 this policy changed, permitting fan fiction to be licensed as derivative fiction under the Creative Commons umbrella.

==Personal life==
She married Anthony Lackey in 1972, and they divorced in 1990. In 1990, she married Larry Dixon. The couple live outside of Tulsa, Oklahoma.

===Other interests===

Lackey and Dixon have in the past worked in raptor rehabilitation. She refers to her various parrots as her &quot;feathered children&quot;. The afterwords to some of her books refer to rehabilitation and falconry, and this interest has influenced and informed her writing. She also enjoys beadwork, costuming, and needlework. She claims, however, to be a &quot;wretched housekeeper, and by and large an indifferent cook&quot; Besides this, she does radar-reading during tornado season. She helps support the Alex Foundation.

Historically, Lackey was active in the filking community. She was a major contributor to an early album of space filk, &quot;Minus Ten and Counting&quot;. She has won five Pegasus Awards, mostly for her songwriting. She was also active in the Society for Creative Anachronism, and belongs to the Great Dark Horde.

She participates in The Stellar Guild series published by Phoenix Pick. The series pairs bestselling authors like Lackey with lesser known authors in science fiction and fantasy to help provide additional visibility to them.

==Related writers==
Mercedes Lackey was a protégée of Marion Zimmer Bradley, and got her start writing short stories in Bradley&#x27;s story collections. Other mentors include writers C. J. Cherryh and Andre Norton, along with her editor, Elizabeth (Betsy) Wollheim of DAW Books.

Her earlier Velgarth novels are all solo projects, but later volumes in the Valdemar saga are illustrated by her husband Larry Dixon, and in many of her latest works he is also credited as co-author. Many of her other novels are collaborations. She has worked with fantasy authors Andre Norton (such as the Halfblood Chronicles), Marion Zimmer Bradley (such as &quot;Rediscovery&quot; and &quot;Tigers Burning Bright&quot;), Anne McCaffrey (such as &quot;The Ship Who Searched&quot;), and Piers Anthony (&quot;If I Pay Thee Not in Gold&quot;). She has most recently written &quot;The Obsidian Trilogy&quot; with historian James Mallory; a historical fantasy series about an &quot;alternative&quot; Elizabeth I with romance writer Roberta Gellis; and the &quot;Heirs of Alexandria series&quot; with Dave Freer and Eric Flint.

== Adaptations ==

=== Television and film ===
On August 3, 2021, Deadline reported that Radar Pictures had acquired the television rights to the Valdemar novels and that Ted Field would be Executive Producer on the series. The first season is being developed as an adaptation of the Last Herald-Mage trilogy. Kit Williamson and Brittany Cavallaro have been announced as writers and producers for the show.

<doc id="49625" wikidata="Q1519334" url="?curid=49625" title="The New York Sun">
<text>The New York Sun is an American conservative news website and former newspaper based in Manhattan, New York. From 2009 to 2021, it operated as an (occasional and erratic) online-only publisher of political and economic opinion pieces, as well as occasional arts content. Coming under new management in November 2021, it began full-time online publication in 2022.

From 2002 to 2008, &quot;The Sun&quot; was a printed daily newspaper distributed in New York City. It debuted on April 16, 2002, claiming descent from, and adopting the name, motto, and nameplate of, the earlier New York paper &quot;The Sun&quot; (1833–1950). It became the first general-interest broadsheet newspaper to be started in New York City in several decades.

On November 2, 2021, &quot;The New York Sun&quot; was acquired by Dovid Efune, former CEO and editor-in-chief of the &quot;Algemeiner Journal&quot;. Efune confirmed Seth Lipsky in the position of editor-in-chief. Following Efune&#x27;s acquisition, &quot;The New York Sun&quot; resumed full-time online reporting in 2022, focusing on a digital-first strategy.

==History==

=== 2001–2008 ===

The Sun was named with a desire for conscious association with the previous newspaper The Sun which was published from 1833 to 1950. The relaunched &quot;Sun&quot; was founded by a group of investors including publishing magnate Conrad Black. The goal was to provide an alternative to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, featuring front-page news about local and state events, in contrast to the emphasis on national and international news by the &quot;Times&quot;. The Sun began business operations, prior to first publication, in October 2001.

The newspaper&#x27;s president and editor-in-chief was Seth Lipsky, former editor of &quot;The Jewish Daily Forward&quot;. Managing editor Ira Stoll also served as company vice-president. Stoll had been a longtime critic of &quot;The New York Times&quot; in his media watchdog blog smartertimes.com.

Published from the Cary Building in Lower Manhattan, it ceased print publication on September 30, 2008. When asked why, Lipsky said, &quot;we needed additional funds. . . . [T]he 2008 financial collapse was sweeping the world, and the Internet was emerging as a challenge to traditional newspapering.&quot;

The paper&#x27;s motto, which it shared with its predecessor and namesake, was &quot;It Shines For All&quot;.

=== 2009–2021 ===
Its website resumed activity on April 28, 2009.

Despite the closure of the newspaper, &quot;The New York Sun&quot; website renewed activity on April 28, 2009, prompting some observers to consider the possible implications. Michael Calderone of &quot;Politico&quot; quoted Lipsky as saying not to read too much into the initial items since &quot;...a business plan for the site is still in formation,&quot; and &quot;... these are just some very, very early bulbs of spring (or late winter).&quot; It only contained a small subset of the original content of the paper, mostly editorials at irregular intervals, op-ed commentaries and frequent contributions from economist and noted television commentator Lawrence Kudlow. In addition, commentaries on the arts have been published.

=== Online relaunch, 2021 ===
On November 2, 2021, &quot;The New York Sun&quot; was acquired by Dovid Efune, former CEO and editor-in-chief of the &quot;Algemeiner Journal&quot;. Efune confirmed Seth Lipsky in the position of editor-in-chief. Following Efune&#x27;s acquisition, &quot;The New York Sun&quot; resumed full-time online reporting in 2022, focusing on a digital-first strategy.

==Editorial perspective and reception, 2001–2008==
In 2002, Editor-in-chief Lipsky said that the paper&#x27;s prominent op-ed page would champion &quot;limited government, individual liberty, constitutional fundamentals, equality under the law, economic growth ... standards in literature and culture, education&quot;. Another goal, said Lipsky in 2009, was &quot;to seize the local beat from which &quot;The New York Times&quot; was retreating as it sought to become a national newspaper&quot;. In 2004, Stoll characterized &quot;The Sun&quot;&#x27;s political orientation as &quot;right-of-center&quot;, and an associate of Conrad Black predicted in 2002 that the paper would be neoconservative in its outlook. Unsigned editorials in the paper advocated prosecuting Iraq War protestors for treason (2003), nominating Dick Cheney for the presidency (2007), and lowering, rather than raising, the debt ceiling in response to the debt ceiling crisis (2013).

&quot;The Sun&quot;&#x27;s columnists included prominent conservative and neoconservative pundits, including William F. Buckley, Jr., Michael Barone, Daniel Pipes, and Mark Steyn.

&quot;The Sun&quot; supported President George W. Bush and his decision to launch the Iraq War in 2003. The paper also urged strong action against the perceived threat of the Islamic Republic of Iran and also was known for its forceful coverage of Jewish-related issues, and advocacy for Israel&#x27;s right of self-defense, as evidenced in articles by pro-Israel reporter Aaron Klein.

Conservative Catholic commentator and anti-abortionist Richard John Neuhaus, writing in 2006 in &quot;First Things&quot;, described the &quot;Sun&quot; as a paper that had &quot;made itself nearly indispensable for New Yorkers&quot;.

According to Scott Sherman, writing in &quot;The Nation&quot; in April 2007, &quot;The Sun&quot; was &quot;a broadsheet that injects conservative ideology into the country&#x27;s most influential philanthropic, intellectual and media hub; a paper whose day-to-day coverage of New York City emphasizes lower taxes, school vouchers and free-market solutions to urban problems; a paper whose elegant culture pages hold their own against the Times in quality and sophistication; a paper that breaks news and crusades on a single issue; a paper that functions as a journalistic SWAT team against individuals and institutions seen as hostile to Israel and Jews; and a paper that unapologetically displays the scalps of its victims.&quot;

In the same article, Mark Malloch Brown, Kofi Annan&#x27;s chief of staff at the United Nations, described &quot;The Sun&quot; as &quot;a pimple on the backside of American journalism.&quot; According to Sherman, Brown &quot;accepts that the paper&#x27;s obsession with the UN translates into influence ... he admitted &quot;The Sun&quot; &quot;does punch way above its circulation number, on occasion&quot;. He goes on to say, &quot;Clearly amongst its minuscule circulation were a significant number of diplomats. And so it did at times act as some kind of rebel house paper inside the UN. It fed the gossip mills and what was said in the cafeterias.&quot; Brown&#x27;s insult was in the context of &quot;The Sun&quot;″s reporting of the UN&#x27;s central role in the Saddam Hussein Oil-for-Food scandal.

In May 2007, &quot;Adweek&quot; columnist Tom Messner called &quot;The Sun&quot; &quot;the best paper in New York&quot;, noting that &quot;&quot;The New York Sun&quot; is a conservative paper, but it gets the respect of the left. &quot;The Nation&quot;″s April 30 issue contains an article on the &quot;Sun&quot;″s rise by Scott Sherman that is as balanced an article as I have ever read in the magazine (not a gibe; you don&#x27;t read &quot;The Nation&quot; for balance).&quot;

Alex Jones of the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy said in 2008, &quot;It was a newspaper especially savored by people who don&#x27;t like &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and there are plenty of those in New York.&quot; The paper also scored more scoops than would be expected for its size and Stephen B. Shepard, dean of the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York said in 2008 that its effective coverage of local news earned it a place in the New York media world. Accordingly, it was known as a good place for young, ambitious, scrappy reporters to start out.

==Features, 2001–2008==
&quot;The Sun&quot; received critical praise for its sports section, writers for which included Steven Goldman, Thomas Hauser, Sean Lahman, Tim Marchman, and John Hollinger. Its crossword puzzle, edited by Peter Gordon, was called one of the two best in the United States. It also published the first regular wine column in a New York newspaper, &quot;Along the Wine Trail&quot;, written by G. Selmer Fougner.

In its first edition, the paper carried the solution to the last crossword puzzle of the earlier &quot;Sun&quot; published in 1950.

==Financial problems, circulation, and end of print run, 2001–2008==
&quot;The Sun&quot; was started anew in 2002 in the face of a long-term decline of newspapers in the United States, loss of advertising revenue to the Internet and the rise of new media. From the beginning, it struggled for existence. &quot;The Sun&quot; was the first new daily newspaper launched in New York since 1976, when News World Communications, a company controlled by the Unification Church, launched &quot;The News World&quot; (that was later renamed the &quot;New York City Tribune&quot; and folded in 1991).

At the time of its creation, one media financial analyst said the &quot;Sun&#x27;s&quot; chances of survival were &quot;pretty grim&quot;, while another media commentator characterized it as &quot;the unlikeliest of propositions&quot;.

It was underfunded from the start, with ten investors putting up a total of approximately $15 million—not enough for long-term running. Beyond Conrad Black, who pulled out in 2003, these included hedge fund managers Michael Steinhardt and Bruce Kovner, private equity fund manager Thomas J. Tisch, and financier and think tank figure Roger Hertog.
&quot;The Sun&quot;″s physical plant, in the Cary Building at Church Street and Chambers Street in Lower Manhattan, was antiquated, with malfunctioning telephones and computers, a trouble-prone elevator and fire alarm system, and dubious bathroom plumbing. Nevertheless, Lipsky had hopes of breaking even within the first year of operation.

The Audit Bureau of Circulations confirmed that in its first six months of publication &quot;The Sun&quot; had an average circulation of just under 18,000. By 2005 the paper reported an estimated circulation of 45,000. In December 2005, &quot;The Sun&quot; withdrew from the Audit Bureau of Circulations to join the Certified Audit of Circulations, whose other New York clients are the free papers &quot;The Village Voice&quot; and &quot;AM New York Metro&quot;, and began an aggressive campaign of free distribution in select neighborhoods.

While &quot;The Sun&quot; claimed &quot;150,000 of New York City&#x27;s Most Influential Readers Every Day&quot;, &quot;The Sun&quot;″s own audit indicated that it was selling approximately 14,000 copies a day—while giving away between 66,000 and 85,000 a day. (The New York &quot;Daily News&quot; sold about 700,000 copies a day during that period.) It offered free subscriptions for a full year to residents in advertiser-desired zip codes; this and other uses of controlled circulation made it more attractive to advertisers, but further diminished its chances of ever becoming profitable.
Similarly, &quot;The Sun&quot;″s online edition was accessible for free since August 2006. &quot;The Sun&quot; acquired the web address www.LatestPolitics.com in 2007.

In a letter to readers published on the front page of the September 4, 2008, edition, Lipsky announced that the paper had suffered substantial losses and would &quot;cease publication at the end of September unless we succeed in our efforts to find additional financial backing.&quot; In particular, the paper&#x27;s existing backers would not put forward more money unless new backers with capital were found. The chance that funding had of materializing was negated by the onset of the financial crisis of 2007–2008, and &quot;The Sun&quot; ceased publication on September 30, 2008. It had approximately 110 employees at that time, and also made use of many freelance writers. Mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg commented that &quot;The Sun shone brightly, though too briefly,&quot; and that its writers were &quot;smart, thoughtful, provocative&quot;.

==Controversies==
Allegations were published in the paper&#x27;s January 9, 2008 issue, written by contributing editor Daniel Johnson about then-candidate Barack Obama and Kenya&#x27;s candidate (and subsequent Prime Minister) Raila Odinga, based on what was later described as &quot;a patently fallacious story ... or at the very least to shirk their responsibility to the truth.&quot;

&quot;The Sun&quot; was listed as a three-time victim of plagiarism when &quot;The News-Sentinel&quot; announced March 1, 2008, that &quot;20 of 38 guest columns ... contributed ... since 2000&quot; by Bush White House staffer Timothy Goeglein were subsequently discovered to have been plagiarized; three were attributed to original articles in &quot;The Sun&quot;. Goeglein resigned.

<text>Suspended: A Cryogenic Nightmare is an interactive fiction video game written by Michael Berlyn and published by Infocom in 1983. Infocom&#x27;s sixth game, it was released for Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Atari 8-bit computers, Commodore 64, Commodore Plus/4, IBM PC compatibles (as a self-booting disk), TRS-80, and TI-99/4A. It was later available for Mac, Amiga, and Atari ST.

==Plot==

The player&#x27;s character has been embedded within a facility that controls vital systems, such as moving public transportation belts and weather control, for an Earth-settled planet called Contra. During the player&#x27;s five-hundred-year tenure, the player would normally be kept in stasis while his sleeping mind serves as the Central Mentality for the largely self-maintaining systems. As the game opens, however, he is awakened by severe error messages; something is going wrong. The facility has suffered catastrophic damage from an earthquake, and the Filtering Computers are shutting down or becoming dangerously unstable. The inhabitants of the city assume that the Central Mentality has gone insane and is purposely harming the city, as a previous CM had done. The player&#x27;s task is to repair the damage and restore the systems to normal states before a crew arrives at the facility to &quot;disconnect&quot; his mind, killing him, to be replaced with a clone.

==Gameplay==

Rather than being free to move about and interact with the game world directly, the player&#x27;s character spends the entire game in a state of suspended animation (hence the title) and can only interact by controlling the actions of a number of robot surrogates. Each robot has its own unique strengths and weaknesses, and describes the same rooms and objects in completely different terms based upon those specializations. The robots are:

#Iris - The only robot with visual sensors, Iris can provide visual descriptions of locations and objects. As the game begins, however, Iris has suffered a burnt-out microchip and cannot see. Iris is confined to the area surrounding the Central Chamber.
#Whiz - The most technical robot, Whiz is used mainly for interfacing with a central library computer for historical and technical information.
#Waldo - The most capable physical manipulator, with several limbs for grasping and holding objects, Waldo perceives the world using sonar. (The term &quot;Waldo&quot; was originally coined by Robert A. Heinlein to describe teleoperated robots.)
#Auda - Auda is equipped with sensitive audio receptors and can provide information on sounds and vibrations.
#Poet - A diagnostic robot, Poet can sense the flow of electricity; he tends to communicate in somewhat cryptic language.
#Sensa - Sensa is specialized for the detection of magnetic and photon emissions.

So, for example, Auda will describe a room primarily in terms of the sounds being generated there, Poet will describe it in terms of diagnostics of the equipment there (and phrase it in amusingly metaphorical language), and Iris will provide a visual description. All six of the robots can be given orders in conjunction, and some of the challenges the player faces require that several of the robots work together to solve them.

There is a seventh robot, an all-purpose multifunction repair robot named Fred, who spends the entirety of the game broken and cannot be repaired.

&quot;Suspended&quot; has six ways to die.

==Release==
The cover of the original release was a three-dimensional moulded plastic mask, with cut-outs that revealed eyes printed on the game&#x27;s manual. Reissues of the game had a more conventional cover. Each package included the following physical items:

#A map of the facility and small tokens representing each robot. These were intended to allow the player to more easily keep track of each character&#x27;s whereabouts in the somewhat confusing layout of the facility. Unlike most other text adventure games, the room descriptions of Suspended do not mention the directions of possible exits, which makes the map vital to playing.
#&quot;Briefing for the Contra Central Mentality&quot;, a booklet that provides an overview of the facility, the robots, the computer system, and the player character&#x27;s responsibilities
#A letter from the Contra Central Lottery Commission Headquarters explaining that the player has been chosen to serve as Central Mentality for the next 500 years
#A Contra Central Mentality Lottery Card

==Reception==
The game sold 99,956 copies.

&quot;Suspended&quot; was well received by critics. &quot;Softline&quot; praised the feelies as &quot;continued breakthroughs in packaging and merchandising&quot;, and noted the game&#x27;s replayability. The magazine concluded that &quot;&quot;Suspended&quot; represents another milestone in the continuing evolution of the interactive computer novel.&quot; &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; considered each robot to have a unique personality, and praised the use of the library computer as an in-game hint system. The game&#x27;s parser and time-saving techniques (such as a &quot;follow&quot; command) were similarly praised. Brian Moriarty of &quot;ANALOG Computing&quot; also praised the robots&#x27; characterization, stating that &quot;a few hours with these electronic personalities will make them your friends&quot; and comparing the experience to that of &quot;a fine novel&quot;. He concluded that &quot;Suspended&quot; and other Infocom products &quot;are among the finest examples of a new and entertaining means of self-expression which can now be regarded as &#x27;literature&#x27; without apology.&quot; &quot;Ahoy!&quot; wrote that Berlyn &quot;has lavished a good deal of complexity and eccentricity into his game. I recommend it.&quot; &quot;Compute!&#x27;s Gazette&quot; called &quot;Suspended&quot; &quot;an exciting, imaginative adventure game that&#x27;s likely to keep you glued to your keyboard for hours.&quot; Although it also noted how the &quot;response time can be somewhat slow&quot; and &quot;some commands require as long as two or more minutes for a response.&quot; But the &quot;Compute!&quot; review concluded: &quot;If the small inconvenience of a sometimes slow response does not bother you, then I can highly recommend Suspended.&quot; &quot;Hi-Res&quot; wrote that &quot;Suspended&quot; &quot;is an excellent game&quot; and &quot;a worthy successor to the &quot;Zork&quot; series.&quot;

The game received a Certificate of Merit in the category of &quot;1984 Best Science Fiction/Fantasy Computer Game&quot; at the 5th annual Arkie Awards.

Bill Wallace reviewed &quot;Suspended&quot; in &quot;Space Gamer&quot; No. 68. Wallace commented that &quot;If you do like text adventures - difficult ones - then this game is a must.&quot;

In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; declared &quot;Suspended&quot; the 58th-best computer game ever released.

<doc id="49627" wikidata="Q853645" url="?curid=49627" title="Universal Disk Format">
<text>Universal Disk Format (UDF) is an open, vendor-neutral file system for computer data storage for a broad range of media. In practice, it has been most widely used for DVDs and newer optical disc formats, supplanting ISO 9660. Due to its design, it is very well suited to incremental updates on both write-once and re-writable optical media. UDF was developed and maintained by the Optical Storage Technology Association (OSTA).

In engineering terms, Universal Disk Format is a profile of the specifications known as ISO/IEC 13346 and ECMA-167.

== Usage ==
Normally, authoring software will master a UDF file system in a batch process and write it to optical media in a single pass. But when packet writing to rewritable media, such as CD-RW, UDF allows files to be created, deleted and changed on-disc just as a general-purpose filesystem would on removable media like floppy disks and flash drives. This is also possible on write-once media, such as CD-R, but in that case the space occupied by the deleted files cannot be reclaimed (and instead becomes inaccessible).

Multi-session mastering is also possible in UDF, though some implementations may be unable to read disks with multiple sessions.

== History ==
The Optical Storage Technology Association standardized the UDF file system to form a common file system for all optical media: both for read-only media and for re-writable optical media. When first standardized, the UDF file system aimed to replace ISO 9660, allowing support for both read-only and writable media. After the release of the first version of UDF, the DVD Consortium adopted it as the official file system for DVD-Video and DVD-Audio.

UDF shares the basic volume descriptor format with ISO 9660. A &quot;UDF Bridge&quot; format is defined since 1.50 so that a disc can also contain a ISO 9660 file system making references to files on the UDF part.

=== Revisions ===

Multiple revisions of UDF have been released:
* Revision 1.00 (24 October 1995). Original Release.
* Revision 1.01 (3 November 1995). Added DVD Appendix and made a few minor changes.
* Revision 1.02 (30 August 1996). This format is used by DVD-Video discs.
* Revision 1.50 (4 February 1997). Added support for CD-R/W Packet Writing and (virtual) rewritability on CD-R/DVD-R media by introducing the Virtual Allocation Table (VAT) structure. Added sparing tables for defect management on rewritable media such as CD-RW, and DVD-RW and DVD+RW. Add UDF bridge.
* Revision 2.00 (3 April 1998). Added support for Stream Files, Access Control lists, Power Calibration, real-time files (for DVD recording) and simplified directory management. VAT support was extended.
* Revision 2.01 (15 March 2000) is mainly a bugfix release to UDF 2.00. Many of the UDF standard&#x27;s ambiguities were resolved in version 2.01.
* Revision 2.50 (30 April 2003). Added the Metadata Partition facilitating metadata clustering, easier crash recovery and optional duplication of file system information: All metadata like nodes and directory contents are written on a separate partition which can optionally be mirrored. This format is used by some versions of Blu-rays and most HD-DVD discs.
* Revision 2.60 (1 March 2005). Added Pseudo OverWrite method for drives supporting pseudo overwrite capability on sequentially recordable media. Has read-only compatibility with UDF 2.50 implementations. (Some Blu-rays use this format.)

UDF Revisions are internally encoded as binary-coded decimals; Revision 2.60, for example, is represented as . In addition to declaring its own revision, compatibility for each volume is defined by the minimum read and minimum write revisions, each signalling the requirements for these operations to be possible for every structure on this image. A &quot;maximum write&quot; revision additionally records the highest UDF support level of all the implementations that has written to this image. For example, a UDF 2.01 volume that does not use Stream Files (introduced in UDF 2.00) but uses VAT (UDF 1.50) created by a UDF 2.60-capable implementation may have the revision declared as , the minimum read revision set to , the minimum write to , and the maximum write to .

== Specifications ==
The UDF standard defines three file system variations, called &quot;builds&quot;. These are:
* &quot;Plain&quot; (Random Read/Write Access). This is the original format supported in all UDF revisions
* &quot;Virtual Allocation Table&quot;, also known as &quot;VAT&quot; (Incremental Writing). Used specifically for writing to write-once media
* &quot;Spared&quot; (Limited Random Write Access). Used specifically for writing to rewritable media

=== Plain build ===
Introduced in the first version of the standard, this format can be used on any type of disk that allows random read/write access, such as hard disks, DVD+RW and DVD-RAM media. Metadata (up to v2.50) and file data is addressed more or less directly. In writing to such a disk in this format, any physical block on the disk may be chosen for allocation of new or updated files.

Since this is the &quot;basic&quot; format, practically any operating system or file system driver claiming support for UDF should be able to read this format.

=== VAT build ===
Write-once media such as DVD-R and CD-R have limitations when being written to, in that each physical block can only be written to once, and the writing must happen incrementally. Thus the &quot;plain&quot; build of UDF can only be written to CD-Rs by pre-mastering the data and then writing all data in one piece to the media, similar to the way an ISO 9660 file system gets written to CD media.

To enable a CD-R to be used virtually like a hard disk, whereby the user can add and modify files on a CD-R at will (so-called &quot;drive letter access&quot; on Windows), OSTA added the &quot;VAT&quot; build to the UDF standard in its revision 1.5. The VAT is an additional structure on the disc that allows packet writing; that is, remapping physical blocks when files or other data on the disc are modified or deleted. For write-once media, the entire disc is virtualized, making the write-once nature transparent for the user; the disc can be treated the same way one would treat a rewritable disc.

The write-once nature of CD-R or DVD-R media means that when a file is deleted on the disc, the file&#x27;s data still remains on the disc. It does not appear in the directory any more, but it still occupies the original space where it was stored. Eventually, after using this scheme for some time, the disc will be full, as free space cannot be recovered by deleting files. Special tools can be used to access the previous state of the disc (the state before the delete occurred), making recovery possible.

Not all drives fully implement version 1.5 or higher of the UDF, and some may therefore be unable to handle VAT builds.

=== Spared (RW) build ===
Rewriteable media such as DVD-RW and CD-RW have fewer limitations than DVD-R and CD-R media. Sectors can be rewritten at random (though in packets at a time). These media can be erased entirely at any time, making the disc blank again, ready for writing a new UDF or other file system (e.g., ISO 9660 or CD Audio) to it. However, sectors of &quot;-RW&quot; media may &quot;wear out&quot; after a while, meaning that their data becomes unreliable, through having been rewritten too often (typically after a few hundred rewrites, with CD-RW).

The plain and VAT builds of the UDF format can be used on rewriteable media, with some limitations. If the plain build is used on a -RW media, file-system level modification of the data must not be allowed, as this would quickly wear out often-used sectors on the disc (such as those for directory and block allocation data), which would then go unnoticed and lead to data loss. To allow modification of files on the disc, rewriteable discs can be used like -R media using the &quot;VAT&quot; build. This ensures that all blocks get written only once (successively), ensuring that there are no blocks that get rewritten more often than others. This way, a RW disc can be erased and reused many times before it should become unreliable. However, it will eventually become unreliable with no easy way of detecting it. When using the &quot;VAT&quot; build, CD-RW/DVD-RW media effectively appears as CD-R or DVD+/-R media to the computer. However, the media may be erased again at any time.

The &quot;spared&quot; build was added in revision 1.5 to address the particularities of rewriteable media. This build adds an extra &quot;Sparing Table&quot; in order to manage the defects that will eventually occur on parts of the disc that have been rewritten too many times. This table keeps track of worn-out sectors and remaps them to working ones. UDF defect management does not apply to systems that already implement another form of defect management, such as Mount Rainier (MRW) for optical discs, or a disk controller for a hard drive.

The tools and drives that do not fully support revision 1.5 of UDF will ignore the sparing table, which would lead them to read the outdated worn-out sectors, leading to retrieval of corrupted data.

An overhead that is spread over the entire disc reserves a portion of the data storage space, limiting the usable capacity of a CD-RW with e.g. 650 MB of original capacity to around 500 MB.

== Character set ==

The UDF specifications allow only one Character Set &quot;OSTA CS0&quot;, which can store any Unicode Code point excluding U+FEFF and U+FFFE. Additional character sets defined in ECMA-167 are not used.

Since Errata DCN-5157, the range of code points was expanded to all code points from Unicode 4.0 (or any newer or older version), which includes Plane 1-16 characters such as Emoji. DCN-5157 also recommends normalizing the strings to Normalization Form C.

The OSTA CS0 character set stores a 16-bit Unicode string &quot;compressed&quot; into 8-bit or 16-bit units, preceded by a single-byte &quot;compID&quot; tag to indicate the compression type. The 8-bit storage is functionally equivalent to ISO-8859-1, and the 16-bit storage is UTF-16 in big endian. 8-bit-per-character file names save space because they only require half the space per character, so they should be used if the file name contains no special characters that can not be represented with 8 bits only.

The reference algorithm neither checks for forbidden code points nor interprets surrogate pairs, so like NTFS the string may be malformed. (No specific form of storage is specified by DCN-5157, but UTF-16BE is the only well-known method for storing all of Unicode while being mostly backward compatible with UCS-2.)

== Compatibility ==

Many DVD players do not support any UDF revision other than version 1.02. Discs created with a newer revision may still work in these players if the ISO 9660 bridge format is used. Even if an operating system claims to be able to read UDF 1.50, it still may only support the &quot;plain&quot; build and not necessarily either the &quot;VAT&quot; or &quot;Spared&quot; UDF builds.

Mac OS X 10.4.5 claims to support Revision 1.50 (see &quot;man mount_udf&quot;), yet it can only mount disks of the &quot;plain&quot; build properly and provides no virtualization support at all. It cannot mount UDF disks with VAT, as seen with the Sony Mavica issue. Releases before 10.4.11 mount disks with Sparing Table but does not read its files correctly. Version 10.4.11 fixes this problem.

Similarly, Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) cannot read DVD-RW discs that use the UDF 2.00 sparing tables as a defect management system. This problem occurs if the UDF defect management system creates a sparing table that spans more than one sector on the DVD-RW disc. Windows XP SP2 can recognize that a DVD is using UDF, but Windows Explorer displays the contents of a DVD as an empty folder. A hotfix is available for this and is included in Service Pack 3.

Due to the default UDF versions and options, a UDF partition formatted by Windows cannot be written under macOS. On the other hand, a partition formatted by macOS cannot be directly written by Windows, due to the requirement of a MBR partition table. In addition, Linux only supports writing to UDF 2.01. A script for Linux and macOS called handles these incompatibilities by using UDF 2.01 and adding a fake MBR; for Windows the best solution is using the command-line tool .

Tools for repairing UDF file systems and for modifying their properties have been made for some operating systems. On Windows, the chkdsk tool is able to repair UDF file systems (if not too damaged, like any file system). A similar tool for Linux, codice_1, was under development by Vojtech Vladyka as an extension of fsck, and it was planned to be added to the &quot;udftools&quot; package. However, it was abandoned by its developer in 2018. 

A tool for toggling the write protection flag, codice_2, was under development by Johannes Truschnigg in 2023 but could not be merged into the main &quot;udftools&quot; package because its maintainer Pali Rohár has reportedly lost access to his GitHub account.

<text>In computing, the SEX assembly language mnemonic has often been used for the &quot;codice_1&quot; machine instruction found in the Motorola 6809. A computer&#x27;s or CPU&#x27;s &quot;sex&quot; can also mean the endianness of the computer architecture used. x86 computers do not have the same &quot;byte sex&quot; as HC11 computers, for example. Functions are sometimes needed for computers of different endianness to communicate with each other over the internet, as protocols often use big endian byte coding by default.

On the RCA 1802 series of microprocessors, the SEX, for &quot;codice_2,&quot; instruction is used to designate which of the machine&#x27;s sixteen 16-bit registers is to be the X (index) register.

==SEX in software: rarely used jargon==
The TLA SEX has humorously been said to stand for &quot;Software EXchange&quot;, meaning copying of software. As file sharing has sometimes spread computer viruses, it has been stated that “illicit SEX can transmit viral diseases to your computer.” The involvement of FTP servers&#x27; /pub directories in this process has led to the name being explained as a contraction of &#x27;pubic&#x27;.

<text>This list of castles in England is not a list of every building and site that has &quot;castle&quot; as part of its name, nor does it list only buildings that conform to a strict definition of a castle as a medieval fortified residence. It is not a list of every castle ever built in England, many of which have vanished without trace, but is primarily a list of buildings and remains that have survived. In almost every case the buildings that survive are either ruined, or have been altered over the centuries. For several reasons, whether a given site is that of a medieval castle has not been taken to be a sufficient criterion for determining whether or not that site should be included in the list.

Castles that have vanished or whose remains are barely visible are not listed, except for some important or well-known buildings and sites. Fortifications from before the medieval period are not listed, nor are architectural follies. In other respects it is difficult to identify clear and consistent boundaries between two sets of buildings, comprising those that indisputably belong in a list of castles and those that do not. The criteria adopted for inclusion in the list include such factors as: how much survives from the medieval period; how strongly fortified the building was; how castle-like the surviving building is; whether the building has been given the title of &quot;castle&quot;; how certain it is that a medieval castle stood on the site, or that the surviving remains are those of a medieval castle; how well-known or interesting the building is; and whether including or excluding a building helps make the list, in some measure, more consistent.

In order to establish a list that is as far as possible comprehensive as well as consistent, it is necessary to establish its boundaries. Before the list itself, a discussion of its scope includes lengthy lists of buildings excluded from the main lists for various reasons. The &quot;Castellarium Anglicanum&quot;, an authoritative index of castles in England and Wales published in 1983, lists over 1,500 castle sites in England. Many of these castles have vanished or left almost no trace. The present list includes more than 800 medieval castles of which there are visible remains, with over 300 having substantial surviving stone or brick remains.

==History==
A castle is a type of fortified structure, developed in Europe during the Middle Ages. The first castles appeared in France in the 10th century, and in England during the 11th century. A few castles are known to have been built in England before the Normans invaded in 1066; a great many were built in the years following, the principal mechanism by means of which the Normans were able to consolidate their control over the country. Whilst a few important castles, such as the White Tower in the Tower of London, were built of stone, most early castles were motte-and-bailey castles of earthwork and timber, which could be constructed quickly. Some were later rebuilt in stone, but there are a great many castle sites in England where all that is visible today are traces of earthworks.

Castles continued to be built in England for several hundred years, reaching a peak of military sophistication in the late 13th century. The two principal elements in their construction were the great tower or keep, such as the White Tower, and the fortified enclosure, such as is provided by the outer wall of the Tower of London. During the 14th century, largely as a result of the decline of feudalism, the construction of strong castles began to decline, in favour of more lightly fortified structures often described as fortified manor houses. In the far north of England, where conditions remained unsettled, fortified buildings continued to be built as late as the 16th century, not only by the rich and powerful but by any with adequate means, as defence not against great armies, but against the notorious Border Reivers. Many took the form of the pele tower, a smaller, more modest version of the castle keep, and many of these still survive, often incorporated in later buildings.

Castles differed from earlier fortifications in that they were generally private fortified residences. Typically, a castle was the residence of a feudal lord, providing the owner with a secure base from which to control his lands, and also a symbol of wealth and power. Earlier fortified structures, such as the Saxon burh or the Iron Age hillfort, provided public or communal defences, as did medieval town or city walls. The many Roman forts of which ruins survive in Britain differed in being wholly military in nature; they were camps or strongholds of the Roman army. The Romans also built town or city walls in England, which can still be seen, for instance at Silchester.

By the 16th century the role of fortifications had changed once more with the development of artillery capable of breaching even thick stone walls. In the reign of Henry VIII, fears of invasion led to the building of a series of new fortresses along the south coast of England, known as the Device Forts or Henrician Castles. These were designed to use and to defend against artillery, and since they were not private residences, but national fortifications, they do not possess what architectural historians have come to see as the defining characteristics of a castle. Nonetheless, they are visibly castle-like, being compact, with battlemented walls, squat turrets and sometimes a keep; and they were the last generation of fortresses in England to be known as castles, long before architectural historians began to argue that they should not be. One of them, Pendennis Castle, was one of the last Royalist strongholds to fall to the Parliamentarians during the English Civil War—starvation forcing surrender after a siege of five months.
As the role of the castle as a fortress declined in the later medieval period, its role as a residence increasingly became the more important. Castles such as Herstmonceux were built with fortifications seemingly designed more for show than for strength, implying a further evolution in the role and concept of the castle, becoming less a means of enforcing power but instead a symbol of its possession, a castle becoming a grand residence proclaiming the status of its owner. Once fortifications had become altogether redundant, it became increasingly rare in England for new buildings to be described as castles, in contrast to France, where country houses continued to be known as châteaux.

Once no longer needed as fortresses, castles – if they were not abandoned – were, over the centuries, adapted and modernised to make them more suitable for continued use as residences: large windows were inserted in defensive walls, as at Lumley; outer walls were demolished or lowered to open up views from within, as at Raby; new residential ranges were built to improve and extend accommodation, as at Windsor. Some castles were restored after falling into ruin, like Bamburgh; others, like Belvoir, were demolished and rebuilt, retaining little or none of the original structure. In the 18th and 19th centuries especially, many castles underwent &quot;improvements&quot; by architects such as Anthony Salvin, and in this period a fashion developed for entirely new houses to be built in the style of castles, and to be known as castles. Amongst these was Peckforton Castle, built by Salvin: a building so authentic in its recreation of a medieval castle that it has been described as possibly the last serious fortified home built in Britain.

==Scope and exclusions==
No list of castles in England is ever likely to be complete, because there will never be complete agreement in every case as to whether the remains of a building are those of a castle, whether a given place is the site of a castle, or whether a surviving building should be considered to be a castle.

Perhaps because the castle has become the most familiar type of fortification, many sites of fortifications earlier than the 10th century have become known as castles. Most of these are Iron Age hill forts. Amongst the best known are Abbotsbury Castle, Barbury Castle, Bratton Castle, Cadbury Castle, Castle Dore, Chûn Castle, Liddington Castle, Maen Castle, Maiden Castle and Uffington Castle, whilst many more appear in the List of hillforts in England. Others, such as Melandra Castle, Reculver Castle, Richborough Castle and Whitley Castle, are Roman forts, whilst Daw&#x27;s Castle is a Saxon burh. None of these is included in the present list unless it is also the site of a medieval castle, as is the case with, for instance, Portchester Castle, where an imposing castle was built within the surviving walls of the Roman fort.

Nor are all medieval fortified sites included in the present list. The remains of town and city walls are excluded—most of these appear in the List of town walls in England and Wales. Also excluded are churches with defensive towers, such as Ancroft, Burgh by Sands, Edlingham, Garway, Great Salkeld and Newton Arlosh, as well as other fortified ecclesiastical sites such as Alnwick Abbey, Battle Abbey, Thornton Abbey, Wetheral Priory, Whalley Abbey and St Mary&#x27;s Abbey, York. Some of the pele towers of Northern England are included, but the more modest fortified buildings known as bastles are not, though the distinction between them is not always altogether clear. Amongst fortified manor houses, those given the title of castle are included, whilst many others were more lightly fortified and are excluded. Amongst these are Baddesley Clinton, Cowdray House, Farnhill Hall, Hipswell Hall, Ightham Mote, Little Wenham Hall, Markenfield Hall and Walburn Hall.

The list includes pele towers that became known as castles, or preserve a castle-like aspect. Many others, or their remains, survive much altered—incorporated in later country houses or farmhouses, and are excluded. Amongst these are: Aske Hall, Biddlestone RC Chapel, Bolling Hall, Bolton Old Hall, Boltongate Rectory, Causey Park House, Clennell Hall, Cliburn Hall, Corbridge Low Hall, Cowmire Hall, Craster Arms (Beadnell), Croglin Old Pele, Denton Hall, Dovenby Hall, Dunstan Hall, East Shaftoe Hall, Godmond Hall, Great Salkeld Rectory, Hardrigg Hall, Hepscott Hall, Hetton Hall, Hollin Hall, Hutton Hall (Penrith), Irton Hall, Johnby Hall, Killington Hall, Kirkoswald College, Levens Hall, Little Harle Tower, Nether Hall, Netherby Hall, Ormside Hall, Pockerley Pele, Preston Patrick Hall, Randalholme Hall, Rock Hall, Rudchester Hall, Sella Park, Selside Hall, Skelsmergh Hall, Smardale Hall, Thistlewood Farmhouse, Warnell Hall, Weetwood Hall and Witton Tower.

In the post-medieval period, the distinction between true castles and later mock castles is blurred by the extent to which medieval castles were adapted and rebuilt. At Greystoke a new castle was built incorporating a medieval pele tower; at Thurland a new castle was built from the ruins of the old; at Belvoir the old castle was demolished and a new one built. The building of mock castles might be seen as the logical conclusion of a process already apparent in castles such as Herstmonceux or Tattershall, where the castle-like aspect of the building was becoming more for show than for strength.
Amongst post-medieval buildings in England that are known as castles, a few, such as Peckforton Castle, closely resemble medieval castles. Many others, such as Clearwell Castle, have some castle-like features, and some, like Mereworth Castle, bear no resemblance whatsoever to a castle. The list excludes buildings that neither look like castles, nor incorporate the remains of castles. Amongst these are Bolebroke Castle, Bovey Castle, Bruce Castle, Castle Ashby, Castle Howard, Clifton Castle, Highclere Castle, Mereworth Castle, New Wardour Castle, Sherborne Castle, Wentworth Castle, and Wisbech Castle. Many other buildings with some castle-like features are also excluded. Amongst these are Acton Castle, Allerton Castle, Augill Castle, Avon Castle, Bell&#x27;s Castle, Bolesworth Castle, Bude Castle, Castle Eden Castle, Castle Goring, Cave Castle, Cholmondeley Castle, Clearwell Castle, Cliffe Castle, Coates Castle, Creech Castle, Droskyn Castle, Edmond Castle, Enmore Castle, Ewell Castle, Farleigh Castle, Farley Castle, Fillingham Castle, Hatherop Castle, Headingley Castle, Highcliffe Castle, Hilfield Castle, Kenwith Castle, Kirby Knowle Castle, Knepp Castle, Luscombe Castle, Midford Castle, Mulgrave Castle, Otterburn Tower, Pentillie Castle, Reeve Castle, Ryde Castle, St. Clare Castle, Sibdon Castle, Sneaton Castle, Stanhope Castle, Studley Castle, Swinton Castle, The Citadel (Weston-under-Redcastle), Tregenna Castle, Vanbrugh Castle, Wadhurst Castle, Wattisham Castle, Whitehaven Castle, Whitstable Castle, Willersley Castle, and Willsbridge Castle. Amongst those that have been demolished is Steephill Castle.

Artificial ruins and follies, often built as memorials or landscape features, are also excluded. Amongst these are Appley Tower, Black Castle, Bladon Castle, Blaise Castle, Bollitree Castle, Boston Castle, Braylsham Castle, Broadway Tower, Carr Hall Castle, Castlebourne, Clent Castle, Clopton Tower, Dinton Castle, Doyden Castle, Dunstall Castle, Durlston Castle, Fort Putnam, Hadlow Castle, Castle in Hagley Park Lawrence Castle, Long&#x27;s Park Castle, Mow Cop Castle, Mowbray Castle, Pirton Castle, Radford Castle, Radway Tower, Ragged Castle (Badminton), Rivington Castle, Rodborough Fort, Ross Castle, Rothley Castle, Roundhay Castle, Sebergham Castle, Severndroog Castle, Shaldon Castle, Sham Castle (Bath), Sledmere Castle, Speedwell Castle, Stainborough Castle, Starlight Castle, Stowe Castle, Strattenborough Castle, Sundorne Castle, Toll House (Clevedon) and Wyke Castle. Finally, the 16th-century Henrician Castles, whose design was closely inspired by medieval castles, are included, but later military fortifications—with just a few exceptions—are not.

However carefully the criteria for including a building or site on this list are set out, borderline cases are inevitable. Many buildings known to incorporate northern pele towers in their fabric, but are no longer castle-like—such as the Red Lion Tower in Haltwhistle—have been excluded. On the other hand, Corby Castle, in which a pele tower survives wholly encased in a later building, is included because it is known as a castle, and by implication continued to fulfil the role of one, at least in part. Kimbolton Castle is included as the site of a medieval castle, and because the present mansion has a castellated aspect in deference to the medieval castle it replaced.

<doc id="49639" wikidata="Q174971" url="?curid=49639" title="Itō Hirobumi">
<text>Prince , born , was a Japanese politician who served as the first prime minister of Japan from 1885 to 1888, and later from 1892 to 1896, in 1898, and from 1900 to 1901. He was a leading member of the &quot;genrō&quot;, a group of senior statesmen that dictated policy during the Meiji era. 

Born into a poor farming family in the Chōshū Domain, Itō and his father were adopted into a low-ranking samurai family. After the opening of Japan in 1854, he joined the nationalist &quot;sonnō jōi&quot; movement before being sent to England to study at University College London in 1863. Following the Meiji Restoration of 1868, Itō was appointed the junior councilor for foreign affairs in the newly formed Empire of Japan. In 1870, he traveled to the United States to study Western currency, and subsequently helped establish Japan&#x27;s taxation system in 1871. Itō then set off on another overseas trip with the Iwakura Mission to the U.S. and Europe. Upon his return to Japan in 1873, he became a full councilor and public works minister.

During the 1880s, Itō emerged as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the Meiji oligarchy. In 1881, he was officially entrusted with overseeing the drafting of Japan&#x27;s first Constitution. After traveling to Europe to study its nations&#x27; political systems, Itō settled on adopting a constitution emulating that of Prussia by reserving considerable power with the emperor while limiting political parties&#x27; involvement in government. In 1885, he replaced the Daijō-kan with a cabinet composed of ministry heads, and himself took up the new position of prime minister. When a draft of the constitution was prepared in 1888, he established a supra-cabinet Privy Council led by himself to discuss and approve it on the emperor&#x27;s behalf before having the Meiji Constitution officially proclaimed in 1899. Even out of office as Japan&#x27;s head of government, Itō continued to wield vast influence over the country&#x27;s policies as a permanent imperial adviser, or &quot;genkun&quot;, and as the President of the Emperor&#x27;s Privy Council. 

On the world stage, Itō Hirobumi presided over an ambitious foreign policy. He strengthened diplomatic ties with the Western powers including Germany, the United States and especially the United Kingdom. In Asia, he oversaw the First Sino-Japanese War and negotiated the surrender of China&#x27;s ruling Qing dynasty on terms aggressively favourable to Japan, including the annexation of Taiwan and the release of Korea from the Chinese Imperial tribute system. While expanding his country&#x27;s claims in Asia, Itō sought to avoid conflict with the Russian Empire through the policy of &quot;Man-Kan kōkan&quot; – the proposed surrender of Manchuria to Russia&#x27;s sphere of influence in exchange for recognition of Japanese hegemony in Korea. However, in a diplomatic visit to Saint Petersburg in November 1901, Itō found Russian authorities completely unreceptive to such terms. Consequently, Japan&#x27;s incumbent prime minister, Katsura Tarō, elected to abandon the pursuit of &quot;Man-Kan kōkan&quot;, which resulted in an escalation of tensions culminating in the Russo-Japanese War.

After Japanese forces emerged victorious over Russia, the ensuing Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905 made Itō the first Japanese Resident-General of Korea. He consented to the total annexation of Korea in response to pressure from the increasingly powerful Imperial Army. Shortly thereafter, he resigned as Resident-General in 1909 and assumed office once again as President of the Imperial Privy Council. Four months later, Itō was assassinated by Korean-independence activist and nationalist An Jung-geun in Harbin, Manchuria. 

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===

Hayashi Risuke () was born on 16 October 1841, in Tsukari, Kumage, Suō Province (present-day Hikari, Yamaguchi Prefecture), the eldest son of farmer Hayashi Jūzō and his wife Kotoko. After his father went bankrupt and left for Hagi, Yamaguchi in 1846, he went to live at his mother&#x27;s parental home. In 1849, Jūzō invited the family to Hagi and the family reunited. There Risuke entered Kubo Gorō Saemon&#x27;s school. Because the family was poor, when Risuke was 12, Jūzō was adopted by samurai servant Mizui Buhē. In 1854, Mizui Buhē was adopted by samurai foot soldier (&quot;ashigaru&quot;) Itō Yaemon from Aihata, Saba. Mizui Buhē was renamed Itō Naoemon, Jūzō took the name Itō Jūzō, and Hayashi Risuke was renamed Itō Shunsuke at first, then Itō Hirobumi. These adoptions allowed both Hirobumi and his father Jūzō to rise to the samurai class and become &quot;ashigaru&quot;. Jūzō was the biological son of , a 5th generation descendant of who was a member of the .

He was a student of Yoshida Shōin at the Shōka Sonjuku and later joined the &quot;Sonnō jōi&quot; movement (&quot;to revere the Emperor and expel the barbarians&quot;), together with Katsura Kogorō. Active in the movement, he took part in an incendiary attack of the British legation on 31 January 1863 led by Takasugi Shinsaku, and in the company of Yamao Yōzō attacked and mortally wounded the head of the Wagakukōdansho institute on 2 February 1863, believing a false report that the institute was looking into ways of toppling the Emperor. Itō was chosen as one of the Chōshū Five who studied at University College London in 1863, and the experience in Great Britain eventually convinced him Japan needed to adopt Western ways.

In 1864, Itō returned to Japan with fellow student Inoue Kaoru to attempt to warn Chōshū Domain against going to war with the foreign powers (the Bombardment of Shimonoseki) over the right of passage through the Straits of Shimonoseki. At that time, he met Ernest Satow for the first time, later a lifelong friend.

=== Political career ===

==== Rise to power ====
After the Meiji Restoration of 1868, Itō was appointed governor of Hyōgo Prefecture, junior councilor for Foreign Affairs, and sent to the United States in 1870 to study Western currency systems. Returning to Japan in 1871, he established Japan&#x27;s taxation system. With the advice of Edmund Morel, a chief engineer of the railway department, Itō endeavored to found the Public Works together with Yamao Yozo. Later that year, he was sent on the Iwakura Mission around the world as vice-envoy extraordinary, during which he won the confidence of Ōkubo Toshimichi, one of the leaders of the Meiji government.

In 1873, Itō was made a full councilor, Minister of Public Works, and in 1875 chairman of the first Assembly of Prefectural Governors. He participated in the Osaka Conference of 1875. After Ōkubo&#x27;s assassination, he took over the post of Home Minister and secured a central position in the Meiji government. By 1881, he successfully pushed for the resignation of Ōkuma Shigenobu, thereby allowing him to emerge as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the Meiji government.

Itō went to Europe in 1882 to study the constitutions of those countries, spending nearly 18 months away from Japan. While working on a constitution for Japan, he also wrote the first Imperial Household Law and established the Japanese peerage system (&quot;kazoku&quot;) in 1884.

In 1885, he negotiated the Convention of Tientsin with Li Hongzhang, normalizing Japan&#x27;s diplomatic relations with Qing-dynasty China. In the same year, In 1885, Itō established a cabinet system of government based on European ideas, replacing the Daijō-kan as the nation&#x27;s main policy-making organization.

==== As Prime Minister ====

On 22 December 1885, Itō became the first Prime Minister of Japan, as the head of First Itō Cabinet. The first Itō Cabinet endeavored to establish institutions preparatory to the promulgation of the Constitution, and in February 1886 established a system of government for each ministry, and in March, the Imperial University (now the University of Tokyo) was established, and in March of the following year, a national academic association was established and supported it. On the other hand, Inoue Kaoru was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs and was given responsibility for amending the treaty, but the amendment proposed by Inoue included the appointment of foreign judges, leading to the problem of appointing private officials. foreign legislation, leading to In July 1887, a revision meeting aimed at foreign countries was cancelled, and Inoue Kaoru resigned in September, leading to defeat. In June of the same year, he began studying the draft constitution with Itō Miyoji, Inoue Tsuyoshi, Kaneko Kentaro and others in Tsushima.

On 30 April 1888, Itō resigned as prime minister, but headed the new Privy Council to maintain power behind-the-scenes. In 1889, he also became the first &quot;genrō&quot;. The Meiji Constitution was promulgated in February 1889. He had added to it the references to the &quot;kokutai&quot; or &quot;national polity&quot; as the justification of the emperor&#x27;s authority through his divine descent and the unbroken line of emperors, and the unique relationship between subject and sovereign. This stemmed from his rejection of some European notions as unfit for Japan, as they stemmed from European constitutional practice and Christianity.

He remained a powerful force while Kuroda Kiyotaka and Yamagata Aritomo, his political nemeses, were prime ministers.

During Itō&#x27;s second term as prime minister (8 August 1892 – 31 August 1896), he supported the First Sino-Japanese War and negotiated the Treaty of Shimonoseki in March 1895, made Taiwan a Japanese colony with his ailing foreign minister Mutsu Munemitsu. In the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation of 1894, he succeeded in removing some of the onerous unequal treaty clauses that had plagued Japanese foreign relations since the start of the Meiji era.

During Itō&#x27;s third term as prime minister (12 January – 30 June 1898), he was forced to contend with the rise of political parties. Both the Liberal Party and the &quot;Shimpotō&quot; opposed his proposed new land taxes, and in retaliation, Itō dissolved the lower house of the Imperial Diet and called for general election. As a result, both parties merged into the &quot;Kenseitō&quot;, won a majority of the seats, and forced Itō to resign. This lesson taught Itō the need for a pro-government political party, so he organized the &quot;Rikken Seiyūkai&quot; (Constitutional Association of Political Friendship) in 1900. Itō&#x27;s womanizing was a popular theme in editorial cartoons and in parodies by contemporary comedians, and was used by his political enemies in their campaign against him.

Itō returned to office as prime minister for a fourth term from 19 October 1900, to 10 May 1901, this time facing political opposition from the House of Peers. Weary of political back-stabbing, he resigned in 1901, but remained as head of the Privy Council as the premiership alternated between Saionji Kinmochi and Katsura Tarō.
Toward the end of August 1901, Itō announced his intention of visiting the United States to recuperate. This turned into a long journey in the course of which he visited the major cities of the United States and Europe. He set off from Yokohama on 18 September, traveled through the U.S. to New York City, and received an honorary doctorate (LL.D.) from Yale University in late October. He then sailed to Boulogne, reaching Paris on 4 November. On 25 November, he reached Saint Petersburg, having been asked by the new prime minister, Katsura Tarō, to sound out the Russians, entirely unofficially, on their intentions in the Far East. Japan hoped to achieve what it called &quot;Man-Kan kōkan&quot;, the exchange of a free hand for Russia in Manchuria for a free hand for Japan in Korea, but Russia, feeling greatly superior to Japan and unwilling to give up the use of Korean ports for its navy, was in no mood to compromise. Foreign minister Vladimir Lamsdorf &quot;thought that time was on the side of his country because of the [Trans-Siberian] railway and there was no need to make concessions to the Japanese&quot;. Itō left empty-handed for Berlin (where he received honors from Kaiser Wilhelm), Brussels, and London. Meanwhile, Katsura had decided that &quot;Man-Kan kōkan&quot; was no longer desirable for Japan, which should not renounce activity in Manchuria. In Britain, Itō met with Lord Lansdowne, which helped lay the groundwork for the Anglo-Japanese Alliance announced early the following year. The failure of his mission to Russia was &quot;one of the most important events in the run-up to the Russo-Japanese War&quot;.

While Prime Minister, Itō invited Professor George Trumbull Ladd of Yale University to serve as a diplomatic adviser to promote mutual understanding between Japan and the United States. Lectures delivered by Ladd in Japan revolutionized its educational methods; he was the first foreigner to receive the Third Class honor (conferred by the Emperor in 1899) and the Second Class honor (in 1907) in the Orders of the Rising Sun. He later wrote a book on his personal experiences in Korea and with Resident-General Itō. When Ladd died, half his ashes were buried in a Buddhist temple in Tokyo and a monument was erected to him.

==== As Resident-General of Korea ====

On 9 November 1905, following the Russo-Japanese War, Itō arrived in Hanseong and gave a letter from the Emperor of Japan to Gojong, Emperor of Korea, asking him to sign the Japan–Korea Protectorate Treaty, which would make Korea a Japanese protectorate. On 15 November 1905, he ordered Japanese troops to encircle the Korean imperial palace.

On 17 November 1905, Itō and Japanese Field Marshal Hasegawa Yoshimichi entered the Jungmyeongjeon Hall, a Russian-designed building that was once part of Deoksu Palace, to persuade Gojong to approve the treaty, but the Emperor refused. Itō then pressured the Emperor&#x27;s ministers with the implied, and later stated, threat of bodily harm, to sign the treaty. Five ministers signed an agreement that had been prepared by Itō in the Jungmyeongjeon. The agreement gave Imperial Japan complete responsibility for Korea&#x27;s foreign affairs, and placed all trade through Korean ports under Imperial Japanese supervision.

After the treaty had been signed, Itō became the first Resident-General of Korea on 21 December 1905. In 1907, he urged Emperor Gojong to abdicate in favor of his son Sunjong and secured the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1907, thereby giving Japan authority to dictate Korea&#x27;s internal affairs.

While Itō was firmly against Korea falling into China or Russia&#x27;s sphere of influence, he also opposed its annexation, advocating instead that the territory should be treated as a protectorate. When the cabinet voted in favor of annexing Korea, he proposed that the process be delayed in the hopes that the decision could eventually be reversed. However, Itō ultimately changed his mind and approved plans to have the region annexed on 10 April 1909. Despite changing his position, he was forced to resign on 14 June 1909 by the Imperial Japanese Army (one of the foremost advocates for Korea&#x27;s annexation). His assassination is believed to have accelerated the path to the Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty.

== Assassination ==

Itō arrived at the Harbin railway station on 26 October 1909 for a meeting with Vladimir Kokovtsov, a Russian representative in Manchuria. There An Jung-geun, a Korean nationalist and independence activist, fired six shots, three of which hit Itō in the chest. He died shortly thereafter. His body was returned to Japan on the Imperial Japanese Navy cruiser , and he was accorded a state funeral on 4 November 1909 at Hibiya Park. An Jung-geun later listed &quot;15 reasons why Itō should be killed&quot; at his trial. On 14 February 1910, Ahn was sentenced to death by hanging, Woo DeukSun to two years in prison, and Jo DoSeon and You Dongha to one year and six months in prison for murder and crimes against the Imperial Japanese Government.

==Legacy==
=== In Japan ===

* A portrait of Itō Hirobumi was on the obverse of the Series C 1,000 yen note from 1963 until a new series was issued in 1984. 
* The publishing company Hakubunkan takes its name from &quot;Hakubun&quot;, an alternate pronunciation of Itō&#x27;s given name.

====Itō Hirobumi former residence in Hagi====

The house where Itō lived from age 14 in Hagi after his father was adopted by Itō Naoemon still exists, and is preserved as a museum. It is a one-story house with a thatched roof and a gabled roof, with a total floor area of 29 &quot;tsubo&quot; and is located 150 meters south of the Shōkasonjuku Academy. The adjacent villa is a portion of a house built by Itō in 1907 in Oimura, Shimoebara-gun, Tokyo (currently Shinagawa, Tokyo). It was a large Western-style mansion, of which three structures, a part of the entrance, a large hall, and a detached room, were transported Hagi. The large hall has a mirrored ceiling and its wooden paneling uses 1000-year old cedar trees from Yoshino. The buildings were collectively designated a National Historic Site in 1932.

=== In Korea ===
The Annals of Sunjong record that Gojong held a positive view of Itō&#x27;s governorship. In an entry for 28 October 1909, almost three years after being forced to abdicate his throne, the former emperor praised Itō, who had died two days earlier, for his efforts to develop Japanese civilization in Korea. However, the integrity of Joseon dated after the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905 is considered dubious by Korean scholars due to the influence exerted over record-keeping by the Japanese.

Itō has been portrayed several times in Korean cinema. His assassination was the subject of North Korea&#x27;s &quot;An Jung-gun Shoots Itō Hirobumi&quot; in 1979 and South Korea&#x27;s &quot;Thomas Ahn Joong Keun&quot; in 2004; both films made his assassin An Jung-geun the protagonist. The 1973 South Korean film &quot;Femme Fatale: Bae Jeong-ja&quot; is a biopic of Itō&#x27;s alleged adopted Korean daughter Bae Jeong-ja (1870–1952).

Itō argued the Pan-Asian view that if East Asians did not co-operate closely with one another, Japan, Korea and China would all fall victim to Western imperialism. Initially, Gojong and the Joseon government shared that belief and agreed to collaborate with the Japanese military. Korean intellectuals had predicted that the victor of the Russo-Japanese War would assume hegemony over their peninsula, and as an Asian power, Japan enjoyed greater public support in Korea than Russia. However, policies such as land confiscation and the drafting of forced labor turned Korean popular opinion against the Japanese, a trend exacerbated by the arrest or execution of those who resisted. An Jung-geun was also a proponent of what was later called Pan-Asianism. He believed in a union of the three East Asian nations to repel Western imperialism and restore peace in the region.

=== Itō memorial temple built ===
On 26 October 1932, the Japanese unveiled in Seoul the Hakubun-ji 博文寺 Buddhist Temple dedicated to Prince Itō. Full official name &quot;Prince Itō Memorial Temple (伊藤公爵祈念寺院)&quot;. Situated in then Susumu Tadashidan Park on the north slope of Namsan, which after liberation became Jangchungdan Park 장충단 공원. From October 1945, the main hall served as student home, ca. 1960 replaced by a guest house of the Park Chung-Hee administration, then reconstructed and again a student guest house. In 1979 it was incorporated into the grounds of the Shilla Hotel then opened. Several other parts of the temple are still at the site.

<text>María de los Ángeles Félix Güereña (; 8 April 1914 – 8 April 2002) was a Mexican actress and singer. Along with Pedro Armendáriz and Dolores del Río, she was one of the most successful figures of Latin American cinema in the 1940s and 1950s. Considered one of the most beautiful actresses of the Golden Age of Mexican cinema, her strong personality and taste for finesse garnered her the title of diva early in her career. She was known as &quot;La Doña&quot;, a name derived from her character in &quot;Doña Bárbara&quot; (1943), and &quot;María Bonita&quot;, thanks to the anthem composed exclusively for her as a wedding gift by her second husband, Agustín Lara. Her acting career consists of 47 films made in Mexico, Spain, France, Italy and Argentina.

==Early life==

María de los Ángeles Félix Güereña was born in Álamos, Sonora, Mexico, on 8 April 1914. Her birth was registered on May 4, which was later misreported as her date of birth.

She was the daughter of Bernardo Félix Flores, a military officer and politician who was of distant Yaqui descent, and Josefina Güereña Rosas, who grew up in the U.S. state of California; both were of Mexican ancestry. She had fifteen siblings: Josefina, María de la Paz, Pablo, Bernardo, Miguel, María de las Mercedes, Fernando, Victoria Eugenia, Ricardo, Benjamín and Ana María del Sacramento.

She spent her childhood in Álamos. During her childhood, she had a close relationship with her brother Pablo. Her mother separated the two siblings, thinking they might be involved in an incestuous relationship. For that reason, Pablo was sent to the Colegio Militar, in Mexico City.

Later, the Félix family moved to Guadalajara. When María was 17, her beauty soon began to attract attention. She was crowned Beauty Queen at the University of Guadalajara. It was at this time that she met Enrique Álvarez Alatorre, a salesman for the cosmetics firm Max Factor. After a brief romance, the couple married in 1931. In 1935, Félix gave birth to her only child, Enrique, nicknamed &quot;Quique&quot;. Her marriage with Álvarez was unsuccessful and the couple divorced in 1937. After her divorce, Félix returned to Guadalajara with her family, where she was the subject of gossip and rumors due to her status as a divorcée. Because of this situation, Félix decided to move to Mexico City with her son.

In Mexico City, she worked as a receptionist in a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office, and lived in a guest house. One day, the father of her son visited the child, and deliberately refused to give the boy back to his mother. Álvarez took the child to Guadalajara. Félix&#x27;s son was recovered with the help of Agustín Lara, her second husband. They planned an elaborate recovery that tricked the grandmother and took the child.

One afternoon after work when walking down the street in Mexico City, director and filmmaker Fernando Palacios approached her asking if she wanted to make movies. Her response was:

Palacios finally persuaded her to break into the movies. Becoming her &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, he began to train her and present her in film circles. She made her first appearance in the &quot;White and Black Ballroom&quot; of the Mexico City Country Club where some of the great Mexican movie stars of the era (Esther Fernández, Lupe Vélez, Andrea Palma) gathered. Eventually she was taken to Hollywood, to the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, where she met Cecil B. DeMille, who offered to launch her film career in Hollywood, but Félix was not interested. She preferred to begin her career in her own country. Finally, thanks to Palacios, she was offered the female lead role in a film by Grovas Productions: &quot;El Peñón de las Ánimas&quot;, directed by Miguel Zacarías.

In the film &quot;El Peñón de las Ánimas&quot;, Félix starred opposite the popular Mexican actor and singer Jorge Negrete. María Félix and Jorge Negrete got off to a bad relationship during the filming because he had asked that his girlfriend, the actress Gloria Marín, be given the lead role. For this reason the filming of the movie was difficult and led to a direct confrontation between Félix and Negrete. That confrontation helped to cement the reputation of Félix as a tough and arrogant woman.

In her second film, &quot;María Eugenia&quot;, Félix would be projected in a role out of her temperamental film personality. However, the film is remembered as the only movie where Félix appeared in swimwear. The same happened with the film &quot;La china poblana&quot; (1943), where Félix claimed to have paid a debt of gratitude to her discoverer Fernando Palacios, who directed the film. Nobody has heard from this movie (the second color film of the Mexican cinema), so it is considered lost. She called both films &quot;her beginner sins&quot;.

Félix was known as &quot;La Doña&quot; for her role in the movie &quot;Doña Bárbara&quot; (1943), based on the novel by the Venezuelan writer Rómulo Gallegos. For the film, another actress (Isabela Corona) was already hired, but when Gallegos first saw Félix, he was charmed by her and said: &quot;Here is my Doña Bárbara!&quot; This movie was filmed in Venezuela with Mexican and Venezuelan actors. &quot;Doña Bárbara&quot; was to be the start of her major collaborations with the Mexican film director Fernando de Fuentes. Félix and de Fuentes filmed together another two films: &quot;La Mujer sin Alma&quot; (1944) and &quot;La Devoradora&quot; (1946). As María Félix herself said, &quot;With these films, I became the number one enemy of the Mexican family morals.&quot;

Without her stereotyped role of a &quot;femme fatale&quot;, María Félix filmed two sophisticated films: &quot;El monje blanco&quot; (1945), directed by Julio Bracho, and &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1946), directed by Antonio Momplet. Both characters required a great dramatic intensity.

Under the direction of Emilio Fernández, María Félix made three successful films: &quot;Enamorada&quot; (1946), &quot;Río Escondido&quot; (1947), and &quot;Maclovia&quot; (1948). The relationship between Félix and Fernández was cordial and smooth, despite the strong and famous temperament of the film director. In &quot;Enamorada&quot;, María Félix found her perfect film partner, the actor Pedro Armendáriz. The films of María Félix with Fernández and his team (writer Mauricio Magdaleno, photographer Gabriel Figueroa, and Armendáriz) had strong presence in several international film festivals. In turn, they gave María Félix her first Ariel Award for &quot;Enamorada&quot; and &quot;Río Escondido&quot;.

Between the films with Fernández, María Félix also worked with Roberto Gavaldón, another director who showcased some of her best performances. Their first collaboration was in &quot;La diosa arrodillada&quot; (1947) with Arturo de Córdova. Thanks to these films, María Félix&#x27;s fame crossed the Atlantic.

In 1948 she was contracted by the Spanish film producer Cesáreo González. In this manner María Félix began her film adventure in Europe. She made only one more film in Mexico (&quot;Doña Diabla&quot;, 1949) until her return in 1952.

=== Europe ===

Félix debuted in the European cinema in Spain, with the film &quot;Mare Nostrum&quot; (1948), directed by Rafael Gil. With Gil as director, she made another two films in 1950: &quot;Una mujer cualquiera&quot; and &quot;La noche del sábado&quot;. In 1951, she filmed the French-Spanish production &quot;La Couronne Noire&quot; directed by Luis Saslavsky based on a story by Jean Cocteau. She debuted in Italy with the film &quot;Incantesimo Tragico&quot; (1951). In the same year, she filmed &quot;Messalina&quot; (1951), directed by Carmine Gallone. During the filming of this movie Félix suffered an emotional shock: her father died of a heart attack in Navojoa.

In 1952, Félix traveled to Argentina, where she filmed &quot;La pasión desnuda&quot; of the Argentine filmmaker Luis César Amadori. In the same year Félix returned to Mexico. She concluded her working relationship with Cesáreo González with the film &quot;Camelia&quot; filmed in her native country. Her stay in Mexico was mainly based on her marriage to the actor and singer Jorge Negrete, her former film rival, with whom she filmed &quot;El rapto&quot;, directed by Emilio Fernández, Negrete&#x27;s last film.

After Negrete&#x27;s death on 5 December 1953, Félix returned to Europe. In France she made the films &quot;La Belle Otero&quot; (1954), and &quot;Les Héros sont Fatigués&quot; (1955), alongside Yves Montand. However, the most important film of Félix in this period was &quot;French Cancan&quot; (1954) directed by Jean Renoir with the legendary French actor Jean Gabin. Her last film shot entirely in Europe was the Spanish film &quot;Faustina&quot;.

===Last films===
Félix returned to Mexico in 1955. This period of her career was characterized by performing in period pieces inspired by the Mexican Revolution. This cycle begins with &quot;La Escondida&quot; (1955). In this film, as well as in stories like &quot;Canasta de cuentos mexicanos&quot; (1955) and &quot;Café Colón&quot; (1958), she worked again with Pedro Armendáriz. In 1956 she starred in &quot;Tizoc&quot; with the actor and singer Pedro Infante. However, the film was not liked by the actress, despite her international success. Eventually she filmed &quot;Beyond All Limits&quot; (1957) with Jack Palance, and the melodramas &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot; and &quot;The Empty Star&quot; (both 1958). In 1959 she played the title role in &quot;The Soldiers of Pancho Villa&quot; with top billing lead Dolores del Río. In 1959 she performed in the Spanish-Mexican co-production &quot;Sonatas&quot; directed by Juan Antonio Bardem and the French-Mexican co-production &quot;La Fièvre Monte à El Pao&quot;, directed by Luis Buñuel.

In the 1960s Félix&#x27;s presence in the cinema was limited to only a few films. The most prominent were &quot;Juana Gallo&quot; (1960), &quot;La bandida&quot; (1963), &quot;Amor y sexo&quot; (&quot;Sapho &#x27;63&quot;, 1963)), and &quot;La Valentina&quot; (1966). In 1970 she filmed &quot;La Generala&quot;, which would be her last film. The Mexican historical telenovela &quot;La Constitución&quot; (1971) would be her last professional acting job. Félix attempted to return to the cinema twice. First, in 1982, with the film &quot;Toña Machetes&quot;, and again in 1986 with the film &quot;Insólito resplandor&quot;. Neither project crystallized, and Félix never reappeared in film.

===Roles declined in Hollywood===
Almost from the beginning of her career, Félix received job offers in Hollywood, but Félix herself said: &quot;They only give me huehuenche (Indian) roles&quot;. While she was in France, Hollywood offered her the female role of &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot;, but she passed and the part went to Jennifer Jones. Another proposal was &quot;The Barefoot Contessa&quot; with Humphrey Bogart, but she refused it, instead making &quot;La Belle Otero&quot; in France. Ava Gardner ended up with the part. Later, the director Robert Aldrich sent her the script of &quot;The Legend of Lylah Clare&quot;, but she did not reach an agreement with the director and Kim Novak got the role.

==Personal life==
Félix was married four times. Her first marriage (1931–1938) was with the cosmetics sales agent Enrique Álvarez Alatorre. 

He fathered her only child, actor Enrique Álvarez Félix (1934–1996). According to journalist Sergio Almázon, once she found her son wearing a white dress and necklace. Infuriated, she beat him unconscious. Álvarez retaliated by taking their son to Guadalajara. Years later Félix was able to get her son back with the help of her second husband, Agustín Lara. Félix&#x27;s relationship with her son was distant in his early years because she sent him to schools abroad &quot;to discipline&quot; him. Years later, Enrique returned to Mexico and started a career as an actor in film and television. Regarding her son, Félix said: &quot;Enrique is a very gifted man, with admirable common sense. He&#x27;s my best friend. I have so much fun with him. He&#x27;s not a &#x27;mama&#x27;s boy&#x27; as many believe. Self-employed, fight like being independent. He has his own career, his audience, his poster and assumes his responsibilities without relying on me.&quot; The unexpected death of Enrique from a heart attack in 1996 affected Félix greatly.

There are conflicting rumors that, in between her marriages to Enrique Álvarez and Agustín Lara, Félix had a brief marriage to Raúl Prado, member of the Trío Calaveras, but no concrete evidence has emerged that the marriage ever took place. Most of the rumors agree in claiming that Prado and Félix allegedly got married in 1943 after meeting on the set of &quot;The Rock of Souls&quot; and separated two months after the wedding. Mexican writer Enrique Serna interviewed the last survivor of the trio, Miguel Bermego, who told him he was a witness to the wedding. Prado&#x27;s niece María Escalera also corroborated the marriage, saying that the marriage ended when Agustín Lara sent Félix a white piano as a gift, and &quot;Raúl threw her out — with the piano. They later divorced. So, it appears, María Félix was my &quot;tía política&quot; [aunt-in-law].&quot; In his book about Félix &quot;María Félix: 47 pasos por el cine&quot;, Paco Ignacio Taibo I wrote about the marriage as factual, saying &quot;While filming this movie, María would meet Raúl Prado, a member of the Los Calaveras trio. After a quick courtship they got married and shortly after they divorced. This is one of the most carefully protected chapters of the star&#x27;s life. María&#x27;s friends keep claiming that it was crazy.&quot; Prado&#x27;s obituary in the Spanish newspaper &quot;El País&quot; in April 1989 reported the marriage as factual, as did some obituaries of Félix&#x27;s, such as the one in Argentine newspaper &quot;La Nación&quot;, the latter which only cited &quot;a biography&quot; as a source. It was cited by &quot;TVyNovelas&quot; as one of the &quot;myths&quot; surrounding Félix. It is known that Félix vehemently denied ever having married Prado. Serna, who also interviewed Félix, said &quot;On our first meeting I asked her about her marriage to Raúl Prado (which she denied until the end), the member of the Calaveras trio who sang in Jorge Negrete&#x27;s films, and she told me that if I was going to go on with those lies, we were not going to be able to work on the book.&quot; Serna added, &quot;At one point she told me: &#x27;Write what you want about me, because they believe anything about me. Say that I slept with an octopus.&#x27;&quot;

Her second marriage (1945–1947) was to the composer Agustín Lara. Félix was a fan of Lara since her adolescence. They were formally introduced by a mutual friend, the actor Tito Novaro. The couple began a highly publicized relationship, which culminated in marriage in 1945. Lara immortalized Félix in a number of songs, such as &quot;Humo en los ojos&quot; (&quot;Smoke in the eyes&quot;), &quot;Cuando vuelvas&quot; (&quot;When you come back&quot;), &quot;Dos puñales&quot; (&quot;Two daggers&quot;), &quot;&quot;Madrid&quot; and especially the famous theme &quot;María Bonita&quot;, composed in Acapulco during their honeymoon. &quot;María Bonita&quot;&quot; would become one of Lara&#x27;s most popular songs. However, the relationship ended in 1947 due to Lara&#x27;s jealousy. Félix said that Lara even tried to kill her in a fit of violent jealousy.

After her second divorce, Félix had romances with some well-known men, such as Mexican aviation entrepreneur Jorge Pasquel, Spanish bullfighter Luis Miguel Dominguín, and Argentine actor Carlos Thompson. Félix met Thompson in Argentina in 1952 during the filming of Luis César Amadori&#x27;s &quot;La pasión desnuda&quot;, and the relationship was reportedly serious to the point that they became engaged to be married, and Félix even called for her son Enrique Álvarez Félix to meet his potential stepfather. However, during filming, Félix received a call from director Emilio Fernández to offer her the leading role in &quot;The Rapture&quot;, which Félix accepted, telling Thompson that after filming of &quot;La pasión desnuda&quot; ended she would return to Mexico to promote the film and announce their future marriage. However, once in Mexico, Félix canceled the wedding days before it would take place, stating that she concluded that the only thing that united her to Thompson was a mere physical attraction and not true love.

During her stay in France, Félix was introduced by the painter Leonor Fini to French writer Jean Cau, assistant of the writer Jean Paul Sartre. Félix had a brief romance with Cau. From the end of 1950 to the spring of 1954, Félix also had a passionate same-sex affair with Suzanne Baulé, better-known as Frede, who at the time ran the cabaret &quot;Le Carroll&#x27;s&quot; on Rue de Ponthieu in Paris, and the two women lived together at the Hotel George-V. The relationship was captured in a painting made by Fini of a plant with two flowers; one had the face of Félix and the other Frede&#x27;s. Frede followed Félix on her filming trips to Buenos Aires and São Paulo upon learning of Félix&#x27;s relationship with Carlos Thompson. Félix and Frede&#x27;s relationship was interrupted by Félix&#x27;s marriage to Jorge Negrete, but upon Negrete&#x27;s death in 1953, Félix returned to Paris to briefly rekindle her relationship with Frede. However, they would violently break-up for good in 1954, leading to a trial in which Félix wanted to take back jewellery she had given to Frede and accused her of theft. Félix lost her lawsuit, and Frede was acquitted and kept the jewellery. Félix retained ownership of the painting Fini made of the two women, and after the break-up persuaded Fini to modify it to erase Frede&#x27;s face, changing it to hers, resulting in the painting&#x27;s two flowers both having Felix&#x27;s face.

In 1953, when Félix returned to Mexico after her stay in Europe and Argentina, she was reunited with an &quot;old enemy&quot;: the actor and singer Jorge Negrete. Unlike their difficult first meeting ten years ago on the set of &quot;El peñón de las ánimas&quot;, Félix found Negrete, in her own words: &quot;surrendered to my feet&quot;. After a brief romance, the couple married in 1953, transmitted by radio to all Latin America, held at the House of Catipoato in Tlalpan. Negrete was already ill when the marriage took place, and died eleven months later at a hospital in Los Angeles, United States, while Félix was in Europe shooting &quot;La Belle Otero&quot;. Félix&#x27;s appearance at his funeral, dressed in trousers, caused a huge scandal, which led her to take refuge in Europe.

Her fourth marriage (1956–1974), was with the Romanian-born French banker Alexander Berger. Félix met Berger in the 1940s, when they were both married. Years later they met again. Félix was married to Berger for 18 years. She tried becoming a mother again, but an accident during a filming in 1957 caused Félix to lose the child. It was at this time that she built her famous home, &quot;La Casa de las Tortugas&quot; (The House of Turtles), designed by Pepe Mendoza and resembling an Italian villa, in Cuernavaca. Berger died in 1974 of lung cancer months after the death of Félix&#x27;s mother, which plunged her into a deep depression. To overcome this depression, she developed a new passion: horses. Some of her horses won major international equestrian awards. Félix kept horses for 11 years.

Her last romantic relationship was the Russian-French painter Antoine Tzapoff, who was 31 years her junior. About him, Félix said: &quot;I don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s the man who has most loved me, but he&#x27;s who has loved me better.&quot;

The press speculated about a strong rivalry between Félix and Dolores del Río, the other leading female figure of Mexican cinema and a successful Hollywood star. Regarding this &quot;rivalry&quot;, Félix said: &quot;With Dolores I had no rivalry. On the contrary, we were friends and always treated each other with great respect, each with our own personality. We were completely different. She was refined, interesting, gentle on the deal, and I&#x27;m energetic, arrogant and bossy.&quot;

== Influence==

=== Art ===
During her life, Félix was a model for many renowned painters. In her adolescence she was painted in Guadalajara by José Clemente Orozco, but Félix said, &quot;He painted me like a skull with make-up.&quot; Félix met the artist Diego Rivera during the filming of &quot;Río Escondido&quot; (1947). Félix developed a friendship with him and his wife, Frida Kahlo. In 1949, Rivera painted a portrait of her, which Félix classified as &quot;very bad&quot;. In later years, Rivera asked to borrow the painting to be displayed as part of a retrospective on Rivera&#x27;s work, but Félix refused. Félix did not like the painting and she sold it to Juan Gabriel for 15 million pesos. Félix would say, “I&#x27;ve never liked Rivera&#x27;s painting, I told him. I wanted him to paint me as a Tehuana, but he said it was very vulgar, so he painted me as he wanted ... naked, because he was very much in love with me. Later, Diego wanted that portrait for an exhibition in the Palacio de Bellas Artes, but since I did not lend it to him, he stopped talking to me for more than a year. One day there was a bricklayer fixing my house, and I sent him to paint [my nude portrait] with white to cover a bit of everything and that&#x27;s how it ended up. I sold it, very badly sold by the way.&quot;

Other renowned artists who recorded Félix in their canvases were the Surrealists Leonor Fini, Leonora Carrington, Remedios Varo and Bridget Tichenor among others. In the 1980s, the Russian-French artist Antoine Tzapoff (Félix&#x27;s last partner) captured her in numerous portraits.

=== Literature, Music, and Theater ===
Félix also had dealings with numerous Mexican and foreign writers and playwrights some of whom have dedicated several novels. Among them they are Renato Leduc, Xavier Villaurrutia, Salvador Novo, Pita Amor, Jean Cocteau and Octavio Paz. Luis Spota was inspired by her life for his novel &quot;The Empty Star&quot;, and Félix even starred in the film version in 1958. Carlos Fuentes did the same in the novel &quot;Zona sagrada&quot;. Her relationship with Fuentes was terminated when the author made the play &quot;Orchids in the Moonlight&quot;, in which he parodies the figures of Félix and Dolores del Río. Félix, angry, called him &quot;mujerujo&quot; (&quot;womanish&quot;).

Songs were composed for Félix, including &quot;María de Todas las Marías&quot; by Juan Gabriel and &quot;Je l&#x27;aime à mourir&quot; by Francis Cabrel.

=== Fashion ===
In fashion, Félix was dressed by designers like Christian Dior, Givenchy, Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel, and Balenciaga. The House of Hermès (Couture Department) designed extravagant creations just for her. She was a noted collector of fine antiques, favoring pieces like her famous collection of Second French Empire furniture. She was also a jewelry connoisseur and had an extensive jewelry collection, including the 41.37 carat (8.274 g), D-flawless &quot;Ashoka&quot; diamond. In 1968, she commissioned a serpent diamond necklace from Cartier. The result was a completely articulated serpent made out of platinum and white gold and encrusted with 178.21 carats (35.642 g) of diamonds. In 1975, she again asked Cartier to create a necklace for her, this time in the shape of two crocodiles. The two crocodile bodies were made of 524.9 grams of gold, one covered with 1,023 yellow diamonds, while the other was adorned with 1,060 circular cut emeralds. Later she sold most of her jewelry back to Cartier. She also left a Rolls-Royce in Paris.

Since Félix&#x27;s death, these jewelry pieces have been displayed as part of &quot;The Art of Cartier Collection&quot; in several museums around the world. To pay tribute to the actress, in 2006 Cartier debuted its &quot;La Doña de Cartier collection&quot;. &quot;The La Doña de Cartier watch&quot; with reptilian links was created to impress by its wild look. The case of the &quot;La Doña de Cartier&quot; features a trapezoid shape with an asymmetrical profile reminiscent of a crocodile&#x27;s head. The wristband of the watch resembles the contours of a crocodile in large, bold and gold scales. The &quot;La Doña de Cartier Collection&quot; also includes jewelry, accessories, and handbags.

Mexican milliner to the stars Gladys Tamez dedicated a hat collection &quot;El Fénix&quot; inspired by and intended to honor Félix.

In 2023, Museo Jumex in Mexico City displayed iconic jewelry pieces worn by Maria Félix in the exhibition “Cartier Design: A Living Legacy” that featured more than 160 pieces and was designed by renowned Mexican architect Frida Escobedo and curated by the Mexican art critic Ana Elena Mallet.

==Death and legacy==

María Félix died in her sleep on 8 April 2002, her 88th birthday in Mexico City. She was buried in her family&#x27;s mausoleum alongside her son Enrique and parents at the Panteón Francés located in Mexico City. In 2018, Google celebrated Felix&#x27;s 104th birthday with a Google Doodle. A skeletal version of Felix appears briefly in the 2017 Pixar film &quot;Coco&quot;, as a guest at a party in the Land of the Dead, with luchador El Santo as her date.

On 21 July 2022, the TelevisaUnivision produced biopic &quot;María Félix: La Doña&quot;, starring Sandra Echeverría, was released on streaming service Vix.

<text>Franz Krienbühl (24 March 1929 – 13 April 2002) was a Swiss speed skater who is mostly known for his inventions that changed the sport.

Starting his international sporting career only in his late thirties at the 1968 Winter Olympics of Grenoble, Krienbühl mostly skated at the back of the field. However, in 1974, he introduced the one-piece skin suit into speed skating. In spite of the fact that he improved his times dramatically, he was initially laughed at. However, when other skaters also showed improvement, the top skaters quickly switched to the suits as well. Krienbühl also introduced minor improvements for skates.

Krienbühl&#x27;s best performance was the eighth position on the 10,000 m at the 1976 Winter Olympics. He stopped speed skating internationally at age 48 the next season, though he continued to skate competitively until 1986. During his career, he won at least 14 Swiss Allround Championships. In 1989, Krienbühl was severely injured in a cycling accident. He died in April 2002, aged 73.
