<text>William Wilberforce (24 August 1759 – 29 July 1833) was a British politician, philanthropist, and a leader of the movement to abolish the slave trade. A native of Kingston upon Hull, Yorkshire, he began his political career in 1780, and became an independent Member of Parliament (MP) for Yorkshire (1784–1812). In 1785, he underwent a conversion experience and became an Evangelical Anglican, which resulted in major changes to his lifestyle and a lifelong concern for reform.

In 1787, Wilberforce came into contact with Thomas Clarkson and a group of activists against the slave trade, including Granville Sharp, Hannah More and Charles Middleton. They persuaded Wilberforce to take on the cause of abolition, and he became a leading English abolitionist. He headed the parliamentary campaign against the British slave trade for 20 years until the passage of the Slave Trade Act 1807.

Wilberforce was convinced of the importance of religion, morality and education. He championed causes and campaigns such as the Society for the Suppression of Vice, British missionary work in India, the creation of a free colony in Sierra Leone, the foundation of the Church Mission Society and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. He supported politically and socially repressive legislation. His critics thought that he was ignoring injustices at home while campaigning for the enslaved abroad.

In later years, Wilberforce supported the campaign for the complete abolition of slavery and continued his involvement after 1826, when he resigned from Parliament because of his failing health. That campaign led to the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, which abolished slavery in most of the British Empire. Wilberforce died just three days after hearing that the passage of the act through Parliament was assured. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, close to his friend William Pitt the Younger.

==Early life and education==

Wilberforce was born in Hull, in Yorkshire, England, on 24 August 1759. He was the only son of Robert Wilberforce (1728–1768), a wealthy merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth Bird (1730–1798). His grandfather, William (1690–1774), had made the family fortune in the maritime trade with Baltic countries. He was twice elected mayor of Hull.

Wilberforce was a small, sickly and delicate child with poor eyesight. In 1767, he began attending Hull Grammar School, which at the time was headed by Joseph Milner, who would become a lifelong friend. Wilberforce profited from the supportive atmosphere at the school, until his father died in 1768. With his mother struggling to cope, the nine-year-old Wilberforce was sent to a prosperous uncle and aunt with houses in both St James&#x27;s Place, London, and Wimbledon. He attended an &quot;indifferent&quot; boarding school in Putney for two years and spent his holidays in Wimbledon, where he grew extremely fond of his relatives. He became interested in evangelical Christianity due to his relatives&#x27; influence, especially that of his aunt Hannah, sister of the wealthy merchant John Thornton, a philanthropist and a supporter of the leading Methodist preacher George Whitefield.

Wilberforce&#x27;s staunchly Church of England mother and grandfather, alarmed at these nonconformist influences and at his leanings towards evangelicalism, brought the 12-year-old boy back to Hull in 1771. Wilberforce was heartbroken at being separated from his aunt and uncle. His family opposed a return to Hull Grammar School because the headmaster had become a Methodist, and Wilberforce continued his education at Pocklington School from 1771 to 1776. Influenced by Methodist scruples, he initially resisted Hull&#x27;s lively social life, but, as his religious fervour diminished, he embraced theatre-going, attended balls, and played cards.
In October 1776, at the age of seventeen, Wilberforce went up to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. The deaths of his grandfather and uncle, in 1774 and 1777 respectively, had left him independently wealthy and as a result he had little inclination or need to apply himself to serious study. Instead he immersed himself in the social round of student life and pursued a hedonistic lifestyle, enjoying cards, gambling and late-night drinking sessions – although he found the excesses of some of his fellow students distasteful. Witty, generous and an excellent conversationalist, Wilberforce was a popular figure. He made many friends, including the more studious future Prime Minister William Pitt. Despite his lifestyle and lack of interest in studying, he managed to pass his examinations and was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1781 and a Master of Arts degree in 1788.

==Early parliamentary career==
Wilberforce began to consider a political career while still at university and during the winter of 1779–1780, he and Pitt frequently watched House of Commons debates from the gallery. Pitt, already set on a political career, encouraged Wilberforce to join him in obtaining a parliamentary seat. In September 1780, at the age of 21 and while still a student, Wilberforce was elected Member of Parliament for Kingston upon Hull, spending over £8,000, as was the custom of the time, to ensure he received the necessary votes. Free from financial pressures, Wilberforce sat as an independent, resolving to be &quot;no party man&quot;. Criticised at times for inconsistency, he supported both Tory and Whig governments according to his conscience, working closely with the party in power, and voting on specific measures according to their merits.

Wilberforce attended Parliament regularly, but he also maintained a lively social life, becoming an habitué of gentlemen&#x27;s gambling clubs such as Goostree&#x27;s and Boodle&#x27;s in Pall Mall, London. The writer and socialite Madame de Staël described him as the &quot;wittiest man in England&quot; and, according to Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, the Prince of Wales said that he would go anywhere to hear Wilberforce sing. Wilberforce used his speaking voice to great effect in political speeches; the diarist and author James Boswell witnessed Wilberforce&#x27;s eloquence in the House of Commons and noted, &quot;I saw what seemed a mere shrimp mount upon the table; but as I listened, he grew, and grew, until the shrimp became a whale.&quot;

During the frequent government changes of 1781–1784, Wilberforce supported his friend Pitt in parliamentary debates. In autumn 1783, Pitt, Wilberforce and Edward Eliot travelled to France for a six-week holiday together. After a difficult start in Rheims, where their presence aroused police suspicion that they were English spies, they visited Paris, meeting Benjamin Franklin, General Lafayette, Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI, and joined the French court at Fontainebleau.

Pitt became Prime Minister in December 1783, with Wilberforce a key supporter of his minority government. Despite their close friendship, there is no record that Pitt offered Wilberforce a ministerial position in this or future governments. This may have been due to Wilberforce&#x27;s wish to remain an independent MP. Alternatively, Wilberforce&#x27;s frequent tardiness and disorganisation, as well as his chronic eye problems that at times made reading impossible, may have convinced Pitt that he was not ministerial material. When Parliament was dissolved in the spring of 1784, Wilberforce decided to stand as a candidate for the county of Yorkshire in the 1784 general election. On 6 April, he was returned as MP for Yorkshire at the age of twenty-four.

===Conversion===
In October 1784, Wilberforce embarked upon a tour of Europe with his mother, sister and Isaac Milner, the younger brother of his former headmaster. They visited the French Riviera and had dinners, played cards, and gambled. In February 1785, Wilberforce returned to London temporarily, to support Pitt&#x27;s proposals for parliamentary reforms. He rejoined the party in Genoa, Italy, and they continued their tour to Switzerland. Milner accompanied Wilberforce to England, and on the journey they read &quot;The Rise and Progress of Religion in the Soul&quot; by Philip Doddridge, a leading early 18th-century English nonconformist.
Wilberforce&#x27;s spiritual journey is thought to have changed course at this time. He started to rise early to read the Bible and pray and kept a private journal. He underwent an evangelical conversion, regretting his past life and resolving to commit his future life and work to the service of God. His conversion changed some of his habits, but not his nature: he remained outwardly cheerful, interested and respectful, tactfully urging others towards his new faith. Inwardly, he became self-critical, harshly judging his spirituality, use of time, vanity, self-control and relationships with others.

At the time, religious enthusiasm was generally regarded as a social transgression and was stigmatised in polite society. Evangelicals in the upper classes were exposed to contempt and ridicule, and Wilberforce&#x27;s conversion led him to question whether he should remain in public life. He sought guidance from John Newton, a leading evangelical Anglican clergyman of the day and Rector of St Mary Woolnoth. Both counselled him to remain in politics, and he resolved to do so &quot;with increased diligence and conscientiousness&quot;. His political views were informed by his faith and by his desire to promote Christianity and Christian ethics in private and public life. His views were often deeply conservative, opposed to radical changes in a God-given political and social order, and focused on issues such as the observance of the Sabbath and the eradication of immorality through education and reform. He was often distrusted by progressive voices because of his conservatism, and regarded with suspicion by many Tories who saw evangelicals as radicals who wanted the overthrow of church and state.

In 1786, Wilberforce leased a house in Old Palace Yard, Westminster, in order to be near Parliament. He began using his parliamentary position to advocate reform by introducing a Registration Bill, proposing limited changes to parliamentary election procedures. In response to the need for bodies for dissection by surgeons, he brought forward a bill to extend the measure permitting the dissection after execution of criminals such as rapists, arsonists, burglars and violent robbers. The bill also advocated the reduction of sentences for women convicted of treason, a crime that at the time included a husband&#x27;s murder. The House of Commons passed both bills, but they were defeated in the House of Lords.

===Abolition of the transatlantic slave trade===

====Initial decision====
The British initially became involved in the slave trade during the 16th century. By 1783, the triangular route that took British-made goods to Africa to buy slaves, transported the enslaved to the West Indies, and then brought slave-grown products such as sugar, tobacco, and cotton to Britain, represented about 80 percent of Great Britain&#x27;s foreign income. British ships dominated the slave trade, supplying French, Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese and British colonies, and in peak years carried forty thousand enslaved men, women and children across the Atlantic in the horrific conditions of the middle passage. Of the estimated 11 million Africans transported into slavery, about 1.4 million died during the voyage.

The British campaign to abolish the slave trade is generally considered to have begun in the 1780s with the establishment of the Quakers&#x27; anti-slavery committees, and their presentation to Parliament of the first slave trade petition in 1783. The same year, Wilberforce, while dining with his Cambridge friend Gerard Edwards, met Rev. James Ramsay, a ship&#x27;s surgeon who had become a clergyman and medical supervisor on the island of St Christopher (later St Kitts). Ramsay was horrified by the conditions endured by the enslaved peoples, both at sea and on the plantations and returned to England and joined abolitionist movements. Wilberforce did not follow up on his meeting with Ramsay, but three years later, inspired by his new faith, Wilberforce became interested in humanitarian reform. In November 1786, he received a letter from Sir Charles Middleton that re-opened his interest in the slave trade. Middleton suggested that Wilberforce bring forward the abolition of the slave trade in Parliament. Wilberforce responded that he &quot;felt the great importance of the subject, and thought himself unequal to the task allotted to him, but yet would not positively decline it&quot;. He began to read widely on the subject and met with a group of abolitionists called the Testonites at Middleton&#x27;s home in the early winter of 1786–1787.

In early 1787, Thomas Clarkson met with Wilberforce for the first time at Old Palace Yard and brought a copy of his essay on the subject. Clarkson visited Wilberforce weekly, bringing first-hand evidence he had obtained about the slave trade. The Quakers, already working for abolition, recognised the need for influence within Parliament, and urged Clarkson to secure a commitment from Wilberforce to bring forward the case for abolition in the House of Commons. It was arranged that Bennet Langton, a Lincolnshire landowner and mutual acquaintance of Wilberforce and Clarkson, would organise a dinner party on 13 March 1787 to ask Wilberforce formally to lead the parliamentary campaign. By the end of the evening, Wilberforce had agreed in general terms that he would bring forward the abolition of the slave trade in Parliament, &quot;provided that no person more proper could be found&quot;.

The same spring, on 12 May 1787, the still hesitant Wilberforce held a conversation with William Pitt and the future Prime Minister William Grenville as they sat under a large oak tree on Pitt&#x27;s estate in Kent. Under what came to be known as the &quot;Wilberforce Oak&quot; at Holwood House, Pitt challenged his friend to give notice of a motion concerning the slave trade before another parliamentarian did. Wilberforce&#x27;s response is not recorded, but he later declared this was when he decided to bring forward the motion.

==Early parliamentary action==

Wilberforce had planned to introduce a motion giving notice that he would bring forward a bill for the Abolition of the Slave Trade during the 1789 parliamentary session. However, in January 1788, he was taken ill with a probable stress-related condition, now thought to be ulcerative colitis. It was several months before he was able to resume work, and he spent time convalescing at Bath and Cambridge. His regular bouts of gastrointestinal illnesses precipitated the use of moderate quantities of opium, which proved effective in alleviating his condition, and which he continued to use for the rest of his life. In Wilberforce&#x27;s absence, Pitt, who had long been supportive of abolition, introduced the preparatory motion himself, and ordered a Privy Council investigation into the slave trade, followed by a House of Commons review.
With the publication of the Privy Council report in April 1789 and following months of planning, Wilberforce commenced his parliamentary campaign. On 12 May 1789, he made his first major speech on the subject of abolition in the House of Commons, in which he reasoned that the trade was morally reprehensible and an issue of natural justice. Drawing on Thomas Clarkson&#x27;s mass of evidence, he described in detail the appalling conditions in which enslaved people travelled from Africa in the middle passage and argued that abolishing the trade would also bring an improvement to the conditions of existing slaves in the West Indies. He moved twelve resolutions condemning the slave trade, but did not refer to the abolition of slavery itself, instead dwelling on the potential for reproduction in the existing slave population should the trade be abolished. With several parliamentarians signalling support for the bill, the opponents of abolition delayed the vote by proposing that the House of Commons hear its own evidence; Wilberforce, in a decision that has been criticised for prolonging the slave trade, reluctantly agreed. The hearings were not completed by the end of the parliamentary session and were deferred until the following year. In the meantime, Wilberforce and Clarkson tried unsuccessfully to take advantage of the egalitarian atmosphere of the French Revolution to press for France&#x27;s abolition of the trade. In January 1790, Wilberforce succeeded in speeding up the hearings by gaining approval for a smaller parliamentary select committee to consider the vast quantity of evidence which had been accumulated. Wilberforce&#x27;s house in Old Palace Yard became a centre for the abolitionists&#x27; campaign and the location for many strategy meetings. Petitioners for other causes also besieged him there.

Interrupted by a general election in June 1790, the committee finished hearing witnesses and in April 1791, with a closely reasoned four-hour speech, Wilberforce introduced the first parliamentary bill to abolish the slave trade. After two evenings of debate, the bill was easily defeated by 163 votes to 88, as the political climate having swung in a conservative direction after the French Revolution and in reaction to an increase in radicalism and to slave revolts in the French West Indies.

A protracted parliamentary campaign to abolish slavery continued, and Wilberforce remained committed to this cause despite frustration and hostility. He was supported by fellow members of the Clapham Sect, among whom was his best friend and cousin Henry Thornton. Wilberforce accepted an invitation to share a house with Henry Thornton in 1792, moving into his own home after Thornton&#x27;s marriage in 1796. Wilberforce, the Clapham Sect and others were anxious to demonstrate that Africans, and particularly freed slaves, had human and economic abilities beyond the slave trade and capable of sustaining a well-ordered society, trade and cultivation. Inspired in part by the utopian vision of Granville Sharp, they became involved in the establishment in 1792 of a free colony in Sierra Leone with black settlers from Britain, Nova Scotia and Jamaica, as well as native Africans and some whites. They formed the Sierra Leone Company, with Wilberforce subscribing liberally to the project in money and time.

On 2 April 1792, Wilberforce brought another bill calling for abolition of the slave trade. Henry Dundas, as Home Secretary, proposed a compromise solution of gradual abolition of the trade over several years. This was passed by 230 to 85 votes, but Wilberforce believed that it was little more than a clever ploy to ensure that total abolition would be delayed indefinitely.

===War with France===
On 26 February 1793, another vote to abolish the slave trade was narrowly defeated by eight votes. The outbreak of war with France the same month prevented further consideration of the issue, as politicians concentrated on the national crisis and the threat of invasion. The same year, and again in 1794, Wilberforce unsuccessfully brought before Parliament a bill to outlaw British ships from supplying enslaved people to foreign colonies. He voiced his concern about the war and urged Pitt and his government to make greater efforts to end hostilities. Growing more alarmed, on 31 December 1794, Wilberforce moved that the government seek a peaceful resolution with France, a stance that created a temporary breach in his long friendship with Pitt.

Abolition continued to be associated in the public consciousness with the French Revolution and with British radical groups, resulting in a decline in public support. Despite this, Wilberforce continued to introduce abolition bills throughout the 1790s.

The early years of the 19th century saw an increased public interest in abolition. In June 1804, Wilberforce&#x27;s bill to abolish the slave trade successfully passed all its stages through the House of Commons. However, it was too late in the parliamentary session for it to complete its passage through the House of Lords. On its reintroduction during the 1805 session, it was defeated, with even the usually sympathetic Pitt failing to support it. On this occasion and throughout the campaign, abolition was held back by Wilberforce&#x27;s trusting, even credulous nature, and his deferential attitude towards those in power. He found it difficult to believe that men of rank would not do what he perceived to be the right thing, and was reluctant to confront them when they did not.

===Final phase of the campaign===

Following Pitt&#x27;s death in January 1806, Wilberforce increased his collaboration with the Whigs, especially the abolitionists. He gave general support to the Grenville–Fox administration, which brought more abolitionists into the cabinet; Wilberforce and Charles Fox led the campaign in the House of Commons.

A radical change of tactics, which involved the introduction of a bill to ban British subjects from aiding or participating in the slave trade to the French colonies, was suggested by the maritime lawyer James Stephen. A bill was introduced and approved by the cabinet, and Wilberforce and other abolitionists maintained a self-imposed silence, so as not to draw any attention to the effect of the bill. The approach was successful and the Foreign Slave Trade Bill received royal assent on 23 May 1806. Wilberforce and Clarkson collected a large volume of evidence against the slave trade over the previous two decades, and Wilberforce spent the latter part of 1806 writing &quot;A Letter on the Abolition of the Slave Trade&quot;, which was a comprehensive restatement of the abolitionists&#x27; case.

Wilberforce was re-elected as an MP for Yorkshire in the 1806 United Kingdom general election, after which he returned to finishing and publishing his &quot;Letter&quot;, a 400-page book which formed the basis for the final phase of the campaign. Lord Grenville, the Prime Minister, successfully introduced an Abolition Bill in the House of Lords first, then Charles Grey moved for a second reading in the Commons on 23 February 1807. As tributes were made to Wilberforce, whose face streamed with tears, the bill was carried by 283 votes to 16. Excited supporters suggested taking advantage of the large majority to seek the abolition of slavery itself, but Wilberforce made it clear that total emancipation was not the immediate goal.

==Personal life==
In his youth, William Wilberforce showed little interest in women, but when he was in his late thirties his friend Thomas Babington recommended 25-year-old Barbara Ann Spooner (1771–1847) as a potential bride. Wilberforce met her two days later on 15 April 1797, and was immediately smitten; following an eight-day whirlwind romance, he proposed. Despite the urgings of friends to slow down, the couple married at the Church of St Swithin in Bath, Somerset, on 30 May 1797. They were devoted to each other, and Barbara was very attentive and supportive to Wilberforce in his increasing ill health, though she showed little interest in his political activities. They had six children in fewer than ten years: William (born 1798), Barbara (born 1799), Elizabeth (born 1801), Robert (born 1802), Samuel (born 1805) and Henry (born 1807). Wilberforce was an indulgent and adoring father who revelled in his time at home and at play with his children.

==Other concerns==

===Political and social reform===
Wilberforce was highly conservative on many political and social issues. He advocated change in society through Christianity and improvement in morals, education and religion, fearing and opposing radical causes and revolution. The radical writer William Cobbett was among those who attacked what they saw as Wilberforce&#x27;s hypocrisy in campaigning for better working conditions for enslaved people while British workers lived in terrible conditions at home. Critics noted Wilberforce&#x27;s support of the suspension of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; in 1795 and his votes for Pitt&#x27;s &quot;Gagging Bills&quot;, which banned meetings of more than 50 people, allowing speakers to be arrested and imposing harsh penalties on those who attacked the constitution. Wilberforce was opposed to giving workers&#x27; rights to organise into unions, in 1799 speaking in favour of the Combination Act, which suppressed trade union activity throughout Britain, and calling unions &quot;a general disease in our society&quot;. He also opposed an enquiry into the 1819 Peterloo Massacre in which eleven protesters were killed at a political rally demanding reform. Concerned about &quot;bad men who wished to produce anarchy and confusion&quot;, he approved of the government&#x27;s Six Acts, which further limited public meetings and seditious writings. Wilberforce&#x27;s actions led the essayist William Hazlitt to condemn him as one &quot;who preaches vital Christianity to untutored savages, and tolerates its worst abuses in civilised states.&quot;

Wilberforce&#x27;s views of women and religion were also conservative. He disapproved of women anti-slavery activists such as Elizabeth Heyrick, who organised women&#x27;s abolitionist groups in the 1820s, protesting: &quot;[F]or ladies to meet, to publish, to go from house to house stirring up petitions—these appear to me proceedings unsuited to the female character as delineated in Scripture.&quot; Wilberforce initially strongly opposed bills for Catholic emancipation, which would have allowed Catholics to become MPs, hold public office and serve in the army, although by 1813, he had changed his views and spoke in favour of a similar bill.

Wilberforce advocated legislation to improve the working conditions for chimney-sweeps and textile workers, engaged in prison reform, and supported campaigns to restrict capital punishment and the severe punishments meted out under the Game laws. He recognised the importance of education in alleviating poverty, and when Hannah More and her sister established Sunday schools for the poor in Somerset and the Mendips, he provided financial and moral support as they faced opposition from landowners and Anglican clergy. From the late 1780s onward, Wilberforce campaigned for limited parliamentary reform, such as the abolition of rotten boroughs and the redistribution of Commons seats to growing towns and cities, though by 1832, he feared that such measures went too far. With others, Wilberforce founded the world&#x27;s first animal welfare organisation, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (later the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals). He was also opposed to duelling, which he described as the &quot;disgrace of a Christian society&quot; and was appalled when his friend Pitt engaged in a duel with George Tierney in 1798, particularly as it occurred on a Sunday, the Christian day of rest.

Wilberforce was generous with his time and money, believing that those with wealth had a duty to give a significant portion of their income to the needy. Yearly, he gave away thousands of pounds, much of it to clergymen to distribute in their parishes. He paid off the debts of others, supported education and missions, and in a year of food shortages, gave to charity more than his own yearly income. He was exceptionally hospitable, and could not bear to sack any of his servants. As a result, his home was full of old and incompetent servants kept on in charity. Although he was often months behind in his correspondence, Wilberforce responded to numerous requests for advice or for help in obtaining professorships, military promotions and livings for clergymen, or for the reprieve of death sentences.

===Evangelical Christianity===
A supporter of the evangelical wing of the Church of England, Wilberforce believed that the revitalisation of the church and individual Christian observance would lead to a harmonious, moral society. He sought to elevate the status of religion in public and private life, making piety fashionable in both the upper- and middle-classes of society. To this end, in April 1797, Wilberforce published &quot;A Practical View of the Prevailing Religious System of Professed Christians in the Higher and Middle Classes of This Country Contrasted With Real Christianity&quot;, on which he had been working since 1793. This was an exposition of New Testament doctrine and teachings and a call for a revival of Christianity, as a response to the moral decline of the nation, illustrating his own testimony and the views which inspired him. The book was influential and a best-seller; 7,500 copies were sold within six months, and it was translated into several languages.

Wilberforce fostered and supported missionary activity in Britain and abroad, and was involved with other members of the Clapham Sect in various evangelical and charitable organisations. He was a founding member of the Church Missionary Society (since renamed the Church Mission Society) and an early vice-president of the London Society for promoting Christianity among the Jews (later the Church&#x27;s Ministry Among Jewish People). Horrified by the lack of Christian evangelism in India, Wilberforce used the 1793 renewal of the British East India Company&#x27;s charter to propose the addition of clauses requiring the company to provide teachers and chaplains and to commit to the &quot;religious improvement&quot; of Indians. The plan was unsuccessful due to lobbying by the directors of the company, who feared that their commercial interests would be damaged. Wilberforce tried again in 1813 when the charter next came up for renewal. Using petitions, meetings, lobbying and letter writing, he successfully campaigned for changes to the charter. Speaking in favour of the Charter Act 1813, he criticised the East India Company and their rule in India for its hypocrisy and racial prejudice, while also condemning aspects of Hinduism including the caste system, infanticide, polygamy and sati.

===Moral reform===
Greatly concerned by what he perceived to be the degeneracy of British society, Wilberforce was active in matters of moral reform, lobbying against &quot;the torrent of profaneness that every day makes more rapid advances&quot;, and considered this issue and the abolition of the slave trade as equally important goals. At the suggestion of Wilberforce and Bishop Porteus, King George III was requested by the Archbishop of Canterbury to issue in 1787 &quot;A Proclamation for the Encouragement of Piety and Virtue&quot;, as a remedy for the rising tide of immorality. The proclamation commanded the prosecution of those guilty of &quot;excessive drinking, blasphemy, profane swearing and cursing, lewdness, profanation of the Lord&#x27;s Day, and other dissolute, immoral, or disorderly practices&quot;. Greeted largely with public indifference, Wilberforce sought to increase its impact by mobilising public figures to the cause, and by founding the Society for the Suppression of Vice. This and other societies in which Wilberforce was a prime mover, mustered support for the prosecution of those who had been charged with violating relevant laws, including brothel keepers, distributors of pornographic material, and those who did not respect the Sabbath.

The writer and clergyman Sydney Smith criticised Wilberforce for being more interested in the sins of the poor than those of the rich, and suggested that a better name would be the &quot;Society for suppressing the vices of persons whose income does not exceed £500 per annum&quot;. Wilberforce&#x27;s attempts to legislate against adultery and Sunday newspapers were also in vain; his involvement and leadership in other, less punitive, approaches were more successful in the long-term, however. By the end of his life, British morals, manners, and sense of social responsibility had increased, paving the way for future changes in societal conventions and attitudes during the Victorian era.

===Emancipation of enslaved Africans===
Wilberforce worked with the members of the African Institution to ensure the enforcement of the abolition of the slave trade and to promote abolitionist negotiations with other countries. In particular, the United States had abolished the slave trade after 1808 and Wilberforce lobbied the American government to enforce its own mandated prohibition more strongly. The same year, Wilberforce moved his family from Clapham to a sizeable mansion with a large garden in Kensington Gore, closer to the Houses of Parliament. In worsening health by 1812, Wilberforce resigned his Yorkshire seat, and became MP for the rotten borough of Bramber in Sussex, a seat with little or no constituency obligations, thus allowing him more time for his family and the causes that interested him. From 1816, Wilberforce introduced a series of bills which would require the compulsory registration of enslaved people, together with details of their country of origin, permitting the illegal importation of foreign slaves to be detected. Later in the same year he began to publicly denounce slavery itself, though he did not demand immediate emancipation, believing incremental change to be more effective in achieving abolition.

In 1820, after a period of poor health and with his eyesight failing, Wilberforce further limited public activities, although he became embroiled in unsuccessful mediation attempts between King George IV, and his estranged wife Caroline of Brunswick, who had sought her rights as queen of the realm. Wilberforce still hoped &quot;to lay a foundation for some future measures for the emancipation of the poor slaves&quot;. Aware that the cause would need younger men to continue the work, in 1821 he asked MP Thomas Fowell Buxton to take over leadership of the campaign in the Commons. As the 1820s continued, Wilberforce increasingly became more of a figurehead for the abolitionist movement, although he continued to appear at anti-slavery meetings, welcoming visitors, and maintaining a busy correspondence on the subject.

In 1823 Wilberforce&#x27;s 56-page &quot;Appeal to the Religion, Justice and Humanity of the Inhabitants of the British Empire in Behalf of the Negro Slaves in the West Indies&quot; was published. The treatise stated that total emancipation was morally and ethically required and that slavery was a national crime which must be ended by parliamentary legislation to gradually abolish slavery. Members of Parliament did not agree, and government opposition in March 1823 stymied Wilberforce&#x27;s call for abolition. On 15 May 1823, Buxton moved another resolution in Parliament for gradual emancipation. Subsequent debates followed on 16 March and 11 June 1824 in which Wilberforce made his last speeches in the House of Commons, and which again saw the emancipationists outmanoeuvred by the government.

==Last years==
Wilberforce&#x27;s health was continuing to fail, and he suffered further illnesses in 1824 and 1825. With his family concerned that his life was endangered, he declined a peerage and resigned his seat in Parliament, leaving the campaign to others.

In 1826, Wilberforce moved from his large house in Kensington Gore to Hendon Park, a more modest property in the countryside of Mill Hill, north of London, where he was joined by his son William and family. William had attempted a series of educational and career paths, and a venture into farming in 1830 led to huge losses, which his father repaid in full, despite offers from others to assist. This left Wilberforce with little income, and he was obliged to let his home and spend the rest of his life visiting family members and friends. He continued his support for the anti-slavery cause, including attending and chairing meetings of the Anti-Slavery Society. Wilberforce approved of the 1830 election victory of the more progressive Whigs, though he was concerned about the implications of their Reform Bill which proposed the redistribution of parliamentary seats towards newer towns and cities and an extension of the franchise.

In 1833, Wilberforce&#x27;s health declined further and he suffered a severe attack of influenza from which he never fully recovered. He made a final anti-slavery speech in April 1833 at a public meeting in Maidstone, Kent. The following month, the Whig government introduced the Bill for the Abolition of Slavery, formally saluting Wilberforce in the process. On 26 July 1833, Wilberforce heard of government concessions that guaranteed the passing of the Bill for the Abolition of Slavery. The following day he grew much weaker, and he died early on the morning of 29 July at his cousin&#x27;s house in Cadogan Place, London.

=== Funeral ===
Wilberforce had left instructions that he be buried with his sister and daughter at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Stoke Newington, just north of London. However, the leading members of both Houses of Parliament urged that he be honoured with a burial in Westminster Abbey. The family agreed and, on 3 August 1833, Wilberforce was buried in the north transept, close to his friend William Pitt. The funeral was attended by many Members of Parliament, as well as by members of the public. The pallbearers included the Duke of Gloucester, the Lord Chancellor Henry Brougham, and the Speaker of the House of Commons Charles Manners-Sutton. While tributes were paid and Wilberforce was laid to rest, both Houses of Parliament suspended their business as a mark of respect.

==Legacy==
Five years after his death, sons Robert and Samuel Wilberforce published a five-volume biography about their father, and subsequently a collection of his letters in 1840. The biography was controversial in that the authors emphasised Wilberforce&#x27;s role in the abolition movement and played down the important work of Thomas Clarkson. Clarkson wrote a book refuting their version of events, and the sons eventually made a half-hearted private apology to him and removed the offending passages in a revision of their biography. For more than a century, Wilberforce&#x27;s role in the campaign dominated the historical record. Later historians have noted the warm and highly productive relationship between Clarkson and Wilberforce, and have termed it one of history&#x27;s great partnerships: without both the parliamentary leadership supplied by Wilberforce and the research and public mobilisation organised by Clarkson, abolition could not have been achieved.

As his sons had desired and planned, Wilberforce has long been viewed as a Christian hero, a statesman-saint held up as a role model for putting his faith into action. Contemporary evangelical and conservative movements in North America appropriate his name and example in their activism. The strategies of Wilberforce and other abolitionists are invoked by anti-abortion activists, who controversially equate the abolition of slavery with ending abortion.

Wilberforce has also been described as a humanitarian reformer who contributed to reshaping the political and social attitudes of the time by promoting concepts of social responsibility and action. In the 1940s, the role of Wilberforce and the Clapham Sect in abolition was downplayed by historian Eric Williams, who argued that abolition was motivated not by humanitarianism but by economics, as the West Indian sugar industry was in decline. Williams&#x27;s approach strongly influenced historians for much of the latter part of the 20th century. More recent historians have noted that the sugar industry was still making large profits at the time of the abolition of the slave trade, and this has led to a renewed interest in Wilberforce and the evangelicals, as well as a recognition of the anti-slavery movement as a prototype for subsequent humanitarian campaigns.

==Memorials==
 In 2019, St Clements University, which is registered in the Turks &amp; Caicos Islands (British West Indies), founded the William Wilberforce Centre for Law and Religion.

Wilberforce&#x27;s life and work have been commemorated in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. In Westminster Abbey, a seated statue of Wilberforce by Samuel Joseph was erected in 1840, bearing an epitaph praising his Christian character and his long labour to abolish the slave trade and slavery.

In Wilberforce&#x27;s hometown of Hull, a public subscription in 1834 funded the Wilberforce Monument, a Greek Doric column topped by a statue of Wilberforce, which stands in the grounds of Hull College near Queen&#x27;s Gardens. Wilberforce Memorial School for the Blind in York was established in 1833 in his honour. Wilberforce&#x27;s birthplace was acquired by the city corporation in 1903 and, following renovation, Wilberforce House in Hull was opened as Britain&#x27;s first slavery museum. In 2006, the University of Hull established the Wilberforce Institute for the study of Slavery and Emancipation in a building beside Wilberforce House.

Various churches within the Anglican Communion commemorate Wilberforce in their liturgical calendars, and Wilberforce University in Ohio, United States, founded in 1856, is named after him. The university was the first owned by African-American people, and is an historically black college. In Ontario, Canada, the Wilberforce Colony was founded by black reformers, and inhabited by freed slaves from the United States.

== In media ==
* &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, a film about Wilberforce and the struggle against the slave trade, was released in 2007 to coincide with the 200th anniversary of Parliament&#x27;s anti-slave trade legislation.
* In 2007, Focus on the Family produced an audio drama called &quot;Grace Victorious: The Story of William Wilberforce&quot;, starring Chris Larkin as Wilberforce.

<text>Erich Johann Albert Raeder (24 April 1876 – 6 November 1960) was a German admiral who played a major role in the naval history of World War II and was convicted of war crimes after the war. He attained the highest possible naval rank, that of grand admiral, in 1939. Raeder led the Kriegsmarine for the first half of the war; he resigned in January 1943 and was replaced by Karl Dönitz. At the Nuremberg trials he was sentenced to life imprisonment but was released early owing to failing health in 1955.

==Early years==
Raeder was born into a middle-class Protestant family in Wandsbek in the Prussian province of Schleswig-Holstein in the German Empire. His father was a headmaster. 

Raeder idolised his father Hans Raeder, who as a teacher and a father was noted for his marked authoritarian views, and who impressed upon his son the values of hard work, thrift, religion and discipline – all of which Raeder was to preach throughout his life. Hans Raeder also taught his children to support the existing government of alleged &quot;non-political&quot; experts led by Bismarck who were said to stand &quot;above politics&quot; and were alleged to only do what was best for Germany. In the same way, Hans Raeder warned his children that if Germany were to become a democracy, that would be a disaster as it would mean government by men &quot;playing politics&quot;-doing what was only best for their petty sectarian interests instead of the nation. 

Like many other middle-class Germans of his time, Hans Raeder strongly disliked the Social Democrats, whom he accused of playing &quot;party politics&quot; in the &quot;Reichstag&quot; by promoting working class interests instead of thinking about the national good, a stance that his son also adopted. Throughout his entire life, Raeder claimed that he was &quot;apolitisch&quot; (someone who was &quot;above politics&quot;, i.e. only thought about the good of the nation instead of his party), and as an &quot;apolitical&quot; officer, Raeder thus maintained that his support for sea power was based upon objective consideration of the national good.

==Naval career until World War II==
===Imperial German Navy===

Raeder joined the &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot; (Imperial Navy) in 1894 and rapidly rose in rank, becoming chief of staff for Franz von Hipper in 1912. Raeder&#x27;s rise up the ranks was due mostly to his intelligence and hard work though from 1901 to 1903 Raeder served on the staff of Prince Heinrich of Prussia, and gained a powerful patron in the process. Owing to his cold and distant personality, Raeder was a man whom even his friends often admitted to knowing very little about. The dominating figure of the Navy was Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the autocratic State Secretary of the Navy. Tirpitz&#x27;s preferred means of obtaining &quot;world power status&quot; was through his &quot;Risikotheorie&quot; (risk theory) where Germany would build a &quot;Risikoflotte&quot; (Risk Fleet) that would make it too dangerous for Britain to risk a war with Germany, and thereby alter the international balance of power decisively in the &quot;Reich&quot; favor. Tirpitz transformed the Navy from the small coastal defense force of 1897 into the mighty High Seas Fleet of 1914.

In 1904, Raeder, who spoke fluent Russian, was sent to the Far East as an observer of the Russo-Japanese War. Starting in 1905, Raeder worked in the public relations section of the Navy, where he first met Tirpitz and began his introduction to politics by briefing journalists to run articles promoting the &quot;Seemachtideologie&quot; and meeting politicians who held seats in the &quot;Reichstag&quot; in order to convert them to the &quot;Seemachtideologie&quot;. Working closely with Tirpitz, Raeder was heavily involved in the lobbying the &quot;Reichstag&quot; to pass the Third Navy Law of 1906 which committed Germany to building &quot;all big gun battleships&quot; to compete with the new British in the Anglo-German naval race that had only begun at the start of the 20th century.

Raeder was the captain of Kaiser Wilhelm II&#x27;s private yacht in the years leading up to World War I. In itself, this was not a rewarding post, but often people in this post were quickly promoted afterwards.

===World War I===
Raeder served as Hipper&#x27;s chief of staff during World War I, as well as in combat posts. He took part in the Battle of Dogger Bank in 1915 and in the Battle of Jutland in 1916. Raeder later described Hipper as an admiral who &quot;hated paperwork&quot;; accordingly, Hipper delegated considerable power to Raeder, who thus enjoyed more influence than his position as chief of staff would suggest.

During and after World War I the German navy was divided into two schools of thought. One, led by Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz (1849–1930), consisted of avid followers of the teachings of the American historian Alfred Thayer Mahan (1840–1914) and believed in building a &quot;balanced fleet&quot; centered around the battleship that would seek out and win a decisive battle of annihilation (&quot;Entscheidungsschlacht&quot;) against the Royal Navy in the event of war. The other school, led by Commander Wolfgang Wegener (1875–1956), argued that because of superior British shipbuilding capacity Germany could never hope to build a &quot;balanced fleet&quot; capable of winning an &quot;Entscheidungsschlacht&quot;, and so the best use of German naval strength was to build a fleet of cruisers and submarines that would wage a &quot;guerre de course&quot; (commerce raiding against an enemy&#x27;s merchant shipping). After reading all three of Wegener&#x27;s papers setting out his ideas, Admiral Hipper decided to submit them to the Admiralty in Berlin, but changed his mind after reading a paper by Raeder attacking the Wegener thesis as flawed. This marked the beginning of a long feud between Raeder and Wegener, with Wegener claiming that his former friend Raeder was jealous of what Wegener insisted were his superior ideas.

In May 1916 Raeder played a major role planning a raid by Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers that aimed to lure out the British battlecruiser force which would then be destroyed by the main High Seas Fleet. This raid turned into the Battle of Jutland. Raeder played a prominent role, and was forced midway through the battle to transfer from to as a result of damage to Hipper&#x27;s flagship.

As chief of staff to Admiral Hipper he was closely involved in a plan of Hipper&#x27;s for a German battlecruiser squadron to sail across the Atlantic and sweep through the waters off Canada down to the West Indies and on to South America to sink the British cruisers operating in those waters, and thereby force the British to redeploy a substantial part of the Home Fleet to the New World. Though Hipper&#x27;s plans were rejected as far too risky, they significantly influenced Raeder&#x27;s later thinking.

On 14 October 1918, Raeder received a major promotion with appointment as deputy to Admiral Paul Behncke, the Naval State Secretary. Raeder had doubts about submarines, but he spent the last weeks of the war working to achieve the Scheer Programme of building 450 U-boats.

On 28 October 1918 the Imperial German fleet at Kiel mutinied when some of the ships&#x27; crews refused to sail out for the a final battle against the British Grand Fleet that the Admiralty had ordered without the knowledge or approval of the German government. Raeder played a major role in attempting to crush the mutiny.

==Weimar Republic==
Raeder&#x27;s two younger brothers were both killed in action in the First World War, and in 1919 his first marriage, which had been under heavy strain due to war-related stress, ended in divorce. For the puritanical Raeder, the divorce was a huge personal disgrace, and for the rest of his life he always denied his first marriage. The years 1918–1919 were some of the most troubled in his life.

===High Seas Fleet mutiny===
In the winter of 1918–19, Raeder was closely involved in the efforts of the naval officer corps, strongly backed by the Defense Minister Gustav Noske to disband the workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; councils established after the Kiel mutiny. Noske was a Majority Social Democrat with firm &quot;law and order&quot; views. During this period, Raeder served as the liaison between the naval officer corps and Noske, and it was Raeder who suggested to Noske on 11 January 1919 that Adolf von Trotha be appointed commander-in-chief of the Navy. Tirpitz&#x27;s attacks on the Emperor&#x27;s leadership during the war had caused a split in the officer corps between the followers of &quot;the Master&quot; and the Kaiser, and Raeder saw Trotha as the only officer acceptable to both factions. Noske in turn asked the Navy for volunteers for the &quot;Freikorps&quot; to crush uprisings from the Communists. The Navy contributed two brigades to the &quot;Freikorps&quot;. Under the Weimar Republic, the military considered itself &quot;überparteilich&quot; (above party), which did not mean political neutrality as implied. The military argued that there were two types of &quot;politics&quot;: &quot;parteipolitisch&quot; (party politics) which was the responsibility of the politicians, and &quot;staatspolitisch&quot; (state politics) which was the responsibility of the military. &quot;Staatspolitisch&quot; concerned Germany&#x27;s &quot;eternal&quot; interests and the &quot;historic mission&quot; of winning world power, which was to be pursued regardless of what the politicians or the people wanted.

===Kapp &quot;putsch&quot;===

After the war, in 1920, Raeder was involved in the failed Kapp Putsch when, together with almost the entire naval officer corps, he declared himself openly for the &quot;government&quot; of Wolfgang Kapp against the leaders of the Weimar Republic. In the summer of 1920 Raeder married his second wife, with whom he later had one son.

After the failure of the Kapp &quot;Putsch&quot; he was marginalized in the Navy, being transferred to the Naval Archives, where for two years he played a leading role in writing the official history of the Navy in World War I. After this, Raeder resumed his steady rise in the navy hierarchy, becoming &quot;Vizeadmiral&quot; (vice admiral) in 1925.

===Commander-in-chief===

On 1 October 1928, Raeder was promoted to admiral and made chief of the Naval Command (&quot;Chef der Marineleitung&quot;) of the &quot;Reichsmarine&quot;, the Weimar Republic Navy. On 1 June 1935, the &quot;Reichsmarine&quot; was renamed the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; and Raeder became its commander-in-chief with the title of &quot;Oberbefehlshaber der Kriegsmarine&quot;. On 20 April 1936, Raeder was promoted to the new rank of &quot;Generaladmiral&quot; and granted the rank and authority of a &quot;Reichsminister&quot; but without the formal title. On 30 January 1937, Hitler conferred the Golden Party Badge on Raeder, thereby enrolling him in the Party (membership number 3,805,228).

==World War II==

Raeder believed the navy was unprepared for the start of World War II by at least five years. The surface fleet was inadequate to fight the Royal Navy and instead adopted a strategy of convoy raiding. Raeder wanted the Kriegsmarine to play an active part because he feared the budget would be cut after the war. The smaller ships were dispersed around the world in order to force the Royal Navy to disperse their ships to combat them, while the battleships would carry out raids in the North Sea, with a view towards gradually reducing the Royal Navy&#x27;s strength at home.

Raeder was unhappy with the outcome of the Battle of the River Plate and believed that Hans Langsdorff should not have scuttled the ship, but instead sailed out to engage the Royal Navy. Fleet commander Hermann Boehm was held responsible and was sacked by Raeder, who also issued orders that ships were to fight until the last shell and either win or sink with their flags flying.

The Allies were using Norwegian airfields to transfer aircraft to the Finns fighting against the Soviets in the Winter War, as well as mining Norwegian waters, and the Germans were alarmed by these developments. If the Allies were to use Norwegian naval bases or successfully mine Norwegian waters, they could cut off Germany&#x27;s vital iron ore imports from Sweden and tighten the blockade of Germany. The Allies had made plans to invade Norway and Sweden in order to cut off those iron ore shipments. Admiral Rolf Carls, commander of the Kriegsmarine in the Baltic Sea region, proposed the invasion of Norway to Raeder in September 1939. Raeder briefed Hitler on the idea in October, but planning did not begin until December 1939. The operation was in low-priority planning until the &quot;Altmark&quot; incident in February 1940, during which a German tanker carrying 300 Allied prisoners in then-neutral Norwegian waters was boarded by sailors from a Royal Navy destroyer and the prisoners were freed. After this, plans for the Norwegian invasion took on a new sense of urgency. The invasion proved costly for the Kriegsmarine, which lost a heavy cruiser, two of its six light cruisers, 10 of its 20 destroyers and six U-boats. In addition, almost all of the other capital ships were damaged and required dockyard repairs, and for a time the German surface fleet had only three light cruisers and four destroyers operational in the aftermath of the Norwegian campaign.

The swift victory over France allowed the Kriegsmarine to base itself in ports on France&#x27;s west coast. This was strategically important as German warships would no longer have to navigate through the dangerous English Channel in order to return to friendly ports, as well as allow them to range farther out into the Atlantic to attack convoys. With the surrender of France, Raeder saw the opportunity to greatly enhance the navy&#x27;s power by confiscating the ships of the French Navy and manning them with his crews. Hitler however, vetoed this idea, afraid that doing so would push the French navy to join the Royal Navy. British fears of Raeder&#x27;s plan resulted in the Attack on Mers-el-Kébir, in which the Royal Navy attacked the French navy despite being at peace with France.
On 11 July 1940, Hitler and Raeder agreed to continue building the battleships called for by Plan Z. Raeder also had bases built at Trondheim on the Norwegian Sea and at Saint-Nazaire and Lorient on the Bay of Biscay. At this time, Raeder and other senior officers began submitting memos to invade (among others) Shetland, Iceland, the Azores, Iran, Madagascar, Kuwait, Egypt and the Dutch East Indies.

In January 1941, the battlecruisers and were sent on a successful commerce-raiding mission in the Atlantic. On 18 March, following the beginning of Lend-Lease, Raeder wanted to start firing on US warships even if unprovoked. He declined to invade the Azores because of the surface ship losses the previous year. Raeder urged Hitler to declare war on the United States throughout 1941 so the Kriegsmarine could begin sinking American warships escorting British convoys.

In April 1941, Raeder planned to follow up the success of &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot;″s commerce-raiding mission with an even larger mission involving a battleship, two battlecruisers and a heavy cruiser under the command of Lütjens, codenamed Operation Rheinübung. The original plan was to have the battlecruisers &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; involved in the operation, but &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was undergoing heavy repairs to her engines, and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; had just suffered a damaging torpedo hit days before which put her out of action for six months. In the end only the and were sent out on the mission, which ended with &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s sinking. The debacle almost saw the end of using capital ships against merchant shipping. Hitler was not pleased and saw the resources used in the construction and operation of the large &quot;Bismarck&quot; as a poor investment.

In late 1941, Raeder planned the &quot;channel dash&quot; which sent the remaining two battleships in the French ports to Germany, for further operations in Norwegian waters. The plan was to threaten the Lend-Lease convoys to the Soviet Union, to deter an invasion of Norway, and to tie down elements of the Home Fleet that might otherwise have been used in the Atlantic against the U-boat wolfpacks.

After the attack on Pearl Harbor Raeder, along with Field Marshal Keitel and Reichsmarschall Göring, urged Hitler to immediately declare war on the United States in view of the US war plan Rainbow Five, and to begin the U-boat attacks off the US east coast, which was later called the &quot;Second Happy Time&quot; by German submariners.

===Resignation===
On 30 January 1943, following Hitler&#x27;s outrage over the Battle of the Barents Sea, Karl Dönitz, the supreme commander of the Kriegsmarine&#x27;s U-boat arm, was promoted to grand admiral, and Raeder was named admiral inspector, a ceremonial office. Raeder had failed to inform Hitler of the battle, which Hitler learned about from the foreign press. Hitler thought the &quot;Lützow&quot; and lacked fighting spirit, according to Albert Speer. The reorganisation fitted Speer&#x27;s goal of working more closely with Dönitz.

==Post-war==

===Nuremberg trial===

Raeder was captured by Soviet troops on 23 June 1945 and imprisoned in Moscow. At the end of July, he was taken to Nuremberg to stand trial on the counts of: (1) conspiracy to commit crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity; (2) planning, initiating, and waging wars of aggression; and (3) crimes against the laws of war.

Raeder was found guilty on all counts and sentenced to life imprisonment. He was surprised as he had expected to be sentenced to death. His wife, supported by German veterans, led several campaigns to free him until, on account of his ill health, he was released on 26 September 1955.

===Death===

Raeder wrote his autobiography, &quot;Mein Leben&quot;, using a ghostwriter.

He died of natural causes in Kiel on 6 November 1960. His wife had died the previous year. He is buried in the &quot;Nordfriedhof&quot; (North Cemetery) in Kiel. Former Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz attended his funeral on 12 November 1960.

<text>Bruce Nauman (born December 6, 1941) is an American artist. His practice spans a broad range of media including sculpture, photography, neon, video, drawing, printmaking, and performance. Nauman lives near Galisteo, New Mexico.

==Life and work==

Nauman was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana, but his father&#x27;s work as an engineer for General Electric meant that the family moved often. He studied mathematics and physics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison (1960–64), and art with William T. Wiley and Robert Arneson at the University of California, Davis (1965–6). In 1964, he gave up painting to dedicate himself to sculpture, performance and cinema collaborations with William Allan and Robert Nelson. He worked as an assistant to Wayne Thiebaud. Upon graduation (MFA, 1966), he taught at the San Francisco Art Institute from 1966 to 1968, and at the University of California at Irvine in 1970. In 1968, he met the singer and performance artist Meredith Monk and signed with the dealer Leo Castelli. Nauman moved from Northern California to Pasadena in 1969. In 1979, Nauman further moved to Pecos, New Mexico. In 1989, he established a home and studio in Galisteo, New Mexico, where he continued to work and live with his second wife, the painter Susan Rothenberg, until her death in 2020. Nauman has two children, Erik and Zoë, with his first wife, Judy Govan, and he also has two grandchildren.

Confronted with &quot;What to do?&quot; in his studio soon after graduating, Nauman had the simple but profound realization that “If I was an artist and I was in the studio, then whatever I was doing in the studio must be art. At this point art became more of an activity and less of a product.” Nauman set up a studio in a former grocery shop in the Mission district of San Francisco and then in a sublet from his university tutor in Mill Valley. These two locations provided the setting for a series of performed actions which he captured in real time, on a fixed camera, over the 10-minute duration of a 16mm film reel. Between 1966 and 1970, he made several videos, in which he used his body to explore the potentials of art and the role of the artist, and to investigate psychological states and behavioural codes.

Much of his work is characterized by an interest in language, often manifesting itself as visual puns. He has an interest in setting the metaphoric and descriptive functions of language against each other, which he also derives from the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein and his concept of the language-game. For example, the neon &quot;Run From Fear – Fun From Rear,&quot; or the photograph &quot;Bound To Fail,&quot; which literalizes the title phrase and shows the artist&#x27;s arms tied behind his back. He seems to be fascinated by the nature of communication and language&#x27;s inherent problems, as well as the role of the artist as supposed communicator and manipulator of visual symbols.

In the 1960s, Nauman began to exhibit his work at Nicholas Wilder&#x27;s gallery in Los Angeles and in New York at Leo Castelli in 1968 along with early solo shows at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum in 1972.

Nauman&#x27;s use of neon as a medium recurs in his works over the decades. He uses neon to make allusions to the numinous connotations of light, similar to Mario Merz, who used neon to bring new life to assemblages of mundane objects. Neon also connotes the public atmosphere by the means of advertising, and in his later works he uses it ironically with private, erotic imagery as seen in his &quot;Hanged Man&quot; (1985).

His &quot;Self Portrait as a Fountain&quot; (1966) shows the artist spouting a stream of water from his mouth. At the end of the 1960s, Nauman began constructing claustrophobic and enclosed corridors and rooms that could be entered by visitors and which evoked the experience of being locked in and of being abandoned. A series of works inspired by one of the artist&#x27;s dreams was brought together under the title of &quot;Dream Passage&quot; and created in 1983, 1984, and 1988. In his installation &quot;Changing Light Corridor with Rooms&quot; (1971), a long corridor is shrouded in darkness, whilst two rooms on either side are illuminated by bulbs that are timed to flash at different rates.

Since the mid-1980s, primarily working with sculpture and video, Nauman developed disturbing psychological and physical themes incorporating images of animal and human body parts, depicting sadistic allusions to games and torture together with themes of surveillance. In 1988, after a hiatus of nearly two decades focused on time-based media, he resumed his work with cast objects.

===Selected works===

Some of Nauman&#x27;s best-known works include:

*&quot;A Rose Has No Teeth&quot; (1966) — Lead, 7.5 x 8 x 2.25 in.

*&quot;Henry Moore bound to fail, back view&quot; (1967–1970) – cast wax relief of a man&#x27;s back with arms tied by ropes. In 2001, this work sold for $9 million at auction. This is one of the highest prices paid for Nauman&#x27;s work.
*&quot;Please/Pay/Attention/Please&quot; (1973) - Collage and letraset, 27.5 x 27.5 in.
*&quot;Elke allowing the floor to rise up over her face&quot; (1973) 39 minutes color sound. She lies on her back, turns over, moves around as the video makes her seem to sink below the floor.

*&quot;One Hundred Fish Fountain&quot; (2005) comprises hollow bronze fish, cast from catfish, bass, whitefish and other species, suspended by wires from the ceiling at different heights, as if swimming in deep water. Below them is a broad, shallow basin, cobbled together from rubber sheeting, which measures 25 feet by 28 feet, from which water is pumped up to each fish through a hose connected to its belly. The environmentally scaled sculpture all but fills the room, allowing just a narrow track for the viewer to edge around the perimeter, in much the same way as Nauman&#x27;s early corridor works first invited then restricted movement.
*&quot;Untitled &quot;Leave the Land Alone&quot;&quot; (1969/2009) – premiered as a public skywriting project over Pasadena for the Armory Center for the Arts in September 2009, initiated by curator Andrew Berardini.

In 2013, &quot;Complex&quot; ranked &quot;Wall-Floor Positions&quot; the 19th best work of performance art in history.

==Influences==
Nauman has cited as major influences the following writers, philosophers, and artists: 
*HC Westermann
*Samuel Beckett
*Ludwig Wittgenstein - Throughout Nauman&#x27;s long career, to a greater or lesser extent, Nauman has credited Wittgenstein as an influence of his work. He has spoken of this influence in several interviews. In a 1970 interview Nauman speaks to the broader sense of Wittgenstein&#x27;s influence: “Just the way Wittgenstein proceeds in thinking about things, his awareness of how to think about things. I don&#x27;t think you can point to any specific piece that&#x27;s the result of reading Wittgenstein, but it has to do with some sort of process of how to go about thinking about things.” This sentiment was also stated in a 1980 article. Nauman makes these statements even though he has pointed to a piece that was directly influenced, in a 1966 interview where Nauman speaks about the piece “A rose has no teeth”, the title of which was a direct quote from one of Wittgenstein&#x27;s &quot;language games&quot;. This relationship is something that art writers have continued to see in his work throughout his career, especially in his linguistic works, whether written or spoken. Arthur C. Danto speaks of Nauman&#x27;s work and his relationship to Wittgenstein in an article written in 1995: “A great deal of the work of Bruce Nauman consists in issuing commands ... it is perhaps helpful to consider those works as having at times the framework and logic of language games — which means, since the works are often directed at us, that we are meant to do something in response ... designed as language games, they address us less as viewers than participants. To experience a Nauman is to interact with it in some way that goes beyond appreciating it as a work of art.&quot; In a similar line of thinking, Janet Kraynak in the book &quot;Please pay attention please&quot; makes a case that a set of works has a similar effect, by the fact that all the pieces &quot;Contain Directive or imperative verbs, calling out &#x27;You&#x27;&quot;, bringing the viewer into this language game that Nauman is setting up. 
*John Cage
*Philip Glass
*La Monte Young
*Meredith Monk
Nauman was a part of the Process Art Movement.

==Art market==
Nauman&#x27;s earliest supporters, in the 1970s, were mainly European patrons and institutions, such as the Kunstmuseum Basel. Chicago-based collector Gerald Elliott was the first American to amass a sizable number of Naumans, including the 1966 plaster sculpture &quot;Mold for a Modernized Slant Step&quot;, all of which went to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, when he died in 1994. Emerging later as a prominent buyer was Friedrich Christian Flick, who collected more than 40 pieces from throughout Nauman&#x27;s career.

Two of Nauman&#x27;s early auction records were for monumental neons, both walls of blinking punning phrases: Sotheby&#x27;s New York hammered down &quot;One Hundred Live and Die&quot; (1984) to the Benesse Art Site, in Naoshima, Japan, for $1.9 million in 1992, and five years later sold &quot;Good Boy/Bad Boy&quot; (1986–87) to the Daros Collection in Zürich for $2.2 million. Nauman&#x27;s neon work &quot;Violins Violence Silence&quot; (1981/82) realized $4 million at Sotheby&#x27;s New York in 2009.

By 2001, the sculpture &quot;Henry Moore Bound to Fail&quot; (1967), a wax and plaster cast of Nauman&#x27;s own arms tied behind his back, had set a new auction record for postwar art when Christie&#x27;s sold it for $9.9 million to François Pinault. In 2002, Sperone Westwater Gallery sold &quot;Mapping the Studio (Fat Chance John Cage)&quot; (2001), four videos showing Nauman&#x27;s cat chasing mice during the night, for $1.2 million apiece to such museums as Tate Modern, London; Dia Art Foundation, New York; Kunstmuseum Basel; and Centre Pompidou, Paris.

Nauman is represented by Sperone Westwater Gallery, New York, and Galerie Konrad Fischer, Düsseldorf and Berlin (since 1968).

<text>The Battle of Wakefield took place in Sandal Magna near Wakefield in northern England, on 30 December 1460. It was a major battle of the Wars of the Roses. The opposing forces were an army led by nobles loyal to the captive King Henry VI of the House of Lancaster and his Queen Margaret of Anjou on one side, and the army of Richard, Duke of York, the rival claimant to the throne, on the other.

For several years before the battle, the Duke of York had become increasingly opposed to the weak King Henry&#x27;s court. After open warfare broke out between the factions and Henry became his prisoner, he laid claim to the throne, but lacked sufficient support. Instead, in an agreement known as the Act of Accord, he was made Henry&#x27;s heir to the throne, displacing from the succession Henry&#x27;s and Margaret&#x27;s 7-year-old son Edward, Prince of Wales. Margaret of Anjou and several prominent nobles were irreconcilably opposed to this accord, and massed their armies in the north. Richard of York marched north to deal with them, but found he was outnumbered.

Although he occupied Sandal Castle, York sortied from the castle on 30 December. His reasons for doing so have been variously ascribed to deception by the Lancastrian armies, or treachery by some nobles and Lancastrian officers who York thought were his allies, or simple rashness or miscalculation by York. He was killed and his army was destroyed. Many of the prominent Yorkist leaders and their family members died in the battle or were captured and executed.

==Background==
King Henry VI ascended the throne in 1422, when he was only nine months old. He grew up to be an ineffective king, and prone to spells of mental illness. There were increasingly bitter divisions among the officials and councillors who governed in Henry&#x27;s name, mainly over the conduct of the Hundred Years&#x27; War with France. By the early 1450s, the most important rivalry was that between Richard, Duke of York, and Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset. York argued for a more vigorous prosecution of the war, to recover territories recently lost to the French, while Somerset belonged to the party which tried to secure peace by making concessions. York had been Lieutenant in France for several years and resented being supplanted in that office by Somerset, who had then failed to defend Normandy against French armies.

York was not only the wealthiest magnate in the land, but was also descended through both his parents from King Edward III, leading to calls that he be recognised as successor to the childless King Henry. His rival, Somerset, belonged to the Beaufort family, who were distant cousins of King Henry. Originally illegitimate, the Beauforts had been made legitimate by an act of Parliament but were supposedly barred from the line of succession to the throne. However, there was always the possibility that this could be circumvented and the Beaufort line eventually produced King Henry VII and the Tudor dynasty (via Somerset&#x27;s niece, Margaret Beaufort).

York was appointed Lieutenant of Ireland, effectively exiling him from court, while Somerset increased his influence over the king. In 1452, York marched on London in an attempt to force Henry to dismiss Somerset from the government, but at this stage he lacked support and was forced to swear not to take arms against the king at Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Then in 1453, Henry VI suffered a complete mental breakdown. The Great Council of peers appointed York Lord Protector and he governed the country responsibly, but Henry recovered his sanity after eighteen months and restored Somerset to favour. During Henry&#x27;s madness his queen, Margaret of Anjou, had given birth to a son, which dashed York&#x27;s hopes of becoming king if Henry died.

Fearing arrest for treason, York and his most prominent allies, the Nevilles (York&#x27;s brother in law, the Earl of Salisbury and Salisbury&#x27;s son, the Earl of Warwick, later known as the &quot;Kingmaker&quot;), finally resorted to armed force in 1455. At the First Battle of St Albans, many of York&#x27;s and Salisbury&#x27;s rivals and enemies were killed, including Somerset, the Earl of Northumberland (whose family, the Percys, had been involved in a long-running feud with the Nevilles) and Lord Clifford.

After the battle, York reaffirmed his loyalty to King Henry, who had been found abandoned in a shop in the town. He was reappointed Lord Protector and Lieutenant of Ireland. Margaret of Anjou nevertheless suspected York of wishing to supplant her infant son, Edward, as Henry&#x27;s successor, and the heirs of the Lancastrian nobles who were killed at St Albans remained at deadly feud with York.

==Events of the year preceding Wakefield==
After an uneasy peace during which attempts at reconciliation failed, hostilities broke out again in 1459. Richard of York once again feared indictment for rebellion by a Great Council dominated by his opponents. He and the Nevilles concentrated their forces near York&#x27;s stronghold at Ludlow Castle in the Welsh Marches but at the confrontation with the much larger royal army which became known as the Battle of Ludford, some of Warwick&#x27;s contingent from the garrison of Calais, led by experienced captain Andrew Trollope, defected overnight. York and the Nevilles promptly abandoned their troops and fled. The next day, the outnumbered and leaderless Yorkist army surrendered.

York went to Ireland, where he had unchallenged support, while Salisbury, Warwick and York&#x27;s eldest son Edward, Earl of March, made their way to Calais, where Warwick was Constable. They narrowly forestalled the new Duke of Somerset who, with Trollope, had been sent to regain it. Lancastrian attempts to reassert their authority over Ireland and Calais failed, but York and his supporters were declared traitors and attainted. The victorious Lancastrians became reviled for the manner in which their army had looted the town of Ludlow after the Yorkist surrender at Ludford Bridge, and the repressive acts of a compliant Parliament of Devils which caused many uncommitted peers to fear for their own property and titles. The country remained in disorder.

In 1460, the Nevilles invaded England through a foothold they had already established at Sandwich and rapidly secured London and the South of England where Warwick had popular support. Warwick and March then advanced north to engage Henry&#x27;s army in the Midlands. At the Battle of Northampton, part of the Lancastrian army defected and the rest were decisively defeated. Henry was captured on the battlefield for the second time. He was taken to London, and confined in the Bishop of London&#x27;s palace. George Neville, Bishop of Exeter, was appointed Chancellor of England and Viscount Bourchier (another of York&#x27;s brothers in law) was appointed Treasurer.

The Duke of York landed in Chester some weeks later and made his way to London with much pomp. Entering Parliament, he attempted to claim the throne, but was met with stunned silence. Even his close allies were not prepared to support such a drastic step. Instead, after the House of Lords had considered his claim, they passed the Act of Accord, by which Henry would remain king, but York would govern the country as Lord Protector. Henry&#x27;s son was disinherited, and York or his heirs would become king on Henry&#x27;s death. The powerless and frightened Henry was forced to assent.

===Lancastrian moves===
When the Battle of Northampton was fought, Queen Margaret and her seven-year-old son Edward had been at Eccleshall Castle near Stafford. After many adventures with brigands and outlaws, they fled via Cheshire to Harlech Castle in North Wales, where they joined Lancastrian nobles (including Henry&#x27;s half-brother Jasper Tudor and the Duke of Exeter) who were recruiting armies in Wales and the West Country. They later proceeded by ship to Scotland, where Margaret gained troops and other aid for the Lancastrian cause from the queen and regent, Mary of Guelders, in return for the surrender of the town and castle of Berwick upon Tweed.

At the same time, other Lancastrians were rallying in Northern England. Many of them, including the Earl of Northumberland and Lords Clifford and Ros, had estates and influence in the north. They were later joined by the Duke of Somerset and the Earl of Devon, who brought their forces from the West Country. Northumberland, Clifford and Somerset were the sons of York&#x27;s and Salisbury&#x27;s rivals who had been killed at St. Albans. The Lancastrian forces mustered near Kingston upon Hull, and were said (in &quot;Gregory&#x27;s Chronicle&quot;, a near-contemporary account) to number 15,000. A substantial part of these forces encamped at Pontefract began pillaging York&#x27;s and Salisbury&#x27;s estates nearby.

===York&#x27;s response===
Faced with these challenges to his authority as Protector, York despatched his eldest son Edward to the Welsh Marches to contain the Lancastrians in Wales and left the Earl of Warwick in charge in London. He himself marched to the north of England on 9 December, accompanied by his second son Edmund, Earl of Rutland, and the Earl of Salisbury. He tried to bring a train of artillery under &quot;one called Lovelace, a gentleman of Kent&quot; but bad weather forced the artillery to return to London.

York&#x27;s and Salisbury&#x27;s army was said by some to number 8,000 to 9,000 men, but by others to be only a few hundred strong, as York intended to recruit local forces with a Commission of Array. He had probably underestimated both the numbers of the Lancastrian army in the north and the degree of opposition he had provoked by his attempt to seize the throne. On an earlier expedition to the north during his first protectorship in 1454, he and the Nevilles had easily subdued a rebellion by the Percys and the Duke of Exeter. In 1460, not only had almost every other northern peer joined the Lancastrian army, but York&#x27;s nominal supporters were also divided. The Nevilles were one of the wealthiest and most influential families in the North and in addition to controlling large estates, the Earl of Salisbury had held the office of Warden of the Eastern March for several years. However, in the Neville–Neville feud, the cadet branch of the family headed by Salisbury had largely disinherited and eclipsed the senior branch (sometimes referred to as the &quot;northern Nevilles&quot;) under his great-nephew, the Earl of Westmoreland. Westmoreland had spent several years trying to recover his lands. He had since become too ill, perhaps with some mental disorder, to play any active part. His younger brother, John Neville of Raby, had much to gain by York&#x27;s and Salisbury&#x27;s destruction.

The Lancastrians were still being reinforced. On 16 December, at the Battle of Worksop in Nottinghamshire, York&#x27;s vanguard clashed with Somerset&#x27;s contingent from the West Country moving north to join the Lancastrian army, and was defeated.

==Battle==

On 21 December, York reached his own fortress of Sandal Castle near Wakefield. He sent probes towards the Lancastrian camp at Pontefract to the east, but these were repulsed. York sent for help to his son Edward, but before any reinforcements could arrive, he sortied from the castle on 30 December.

It is not known for certain why York did so. One theory was later recounted in &quot;Edward Hall&#x27;s chronicle&quot;, written a few decades after the event, but partly from first-hand sources, and the contemporary Burgundian Jean de Waurin&#x27;s chronicle. In a stratagem possibly devised by the veteran Andrew Trollope (who by Waurin&#x27;s account had also sent messages to York via feigned deserters that he was prepared to change sides once again) half the Lancastrian army under Somerset and Clifford advanced openly towards Sandal Castle, over the open space known as &quot;Wakefield Green&quot; between the castle and the River Calder, while the remainder under Ros and the Earl of Wiltshire were concealed in the woods surrounding the area. York was probably short of provisions in the castle and, seeing that the enemy were apparently no stronger than his own army, seized the opportunity to engage them in the open rather than withstand a siege while waiting for reinforcements.

Other accounts suggested that, possibly in addition to Trollope&#x27;s deception, York was fooled by some of John Neville of Raby&#x27;s forces displaying false colours into thinking that reinforcements sent by Warwick had arrived. By another contemporary account, William Worcester&#x27;s &quot;Annales Rerum Anglicorum&quot;, John Neville himself obtained a Commission of Array from Richard of York to raise 8,000 men to fight on York&#x27;s side under the Earl of Westmoreland. Having gathered this force and enticed York to leave the castle to rendezvous with him, John Neville then defected to the Lancastrians.

Another suggestion was that York and Somerset had agreed a truce during Christmas until 6 January, the Feast of Epiphany, but the Lancastrians had no intention of honouring the truce. On three successive days, they sent heralds to provoke York into premature action with insulting messages and when York moved into the open the Lancastrians treacherously attacked earlier than had been agreed, catching York at a disadvantage while many of his men were absent foraging for supplies.

The simplest suggestion was that York acted rashly. For example, historian John Sadler states that there was no Lancastrian deception or ambush; York led his men from the castle on a foraging expedition (or by popular belief, to rescue some of his foragers who were under attack) and as successive Lancastrian contingents joined the battle (the last being Clifford&#x27;s division, encamped south and east of Sandal Magna), York&#x27;s army was outnumbered, surrounded and overwhelmed.

The Yorkists marched out of Sandal Castle down the present-day Manygates Lane towards the Lancastrians located to the north of the castle. It is generally accepted that, as York engaged the Lancastrians to his front, others attacked him from the flank and rear, cutting him off from the castle. In Edward Hall&#x27;s words:

... but when he was in the plain ground between his castle and the town of Wakefield, he was environed on every side, like a fish in a net, or a deer in a buckstall; so that he manfully fighting was within half an hour slain and dead, and his whole army discomfited.

===Casualties===
One near-contemporary source (&quot;Gregory&#x27;s Chronicle&quot;) claimed that 2,500 Yorkists and 200 Lancastrians were killed, but other sources give wildly differing figures, from 2,200 to only 700 Yorkists dead.

The Duke of York was either killed in the battle or captured and immediately executed. Some later works support the folklore that he suffered a crippling wound to the knee and was unhorsed, and he and his closest followers then fought to the death at that spot; others relate the account that he was taken prisoner (by one Sir James Luttrell of Devonshire), mocked by his captors and beheaded.

His son Edmund, Earl of Rutland, attempted to escape over Wakefield Bridge, but was overtaken and killed, possibly by Clifford in revenge for his father&#x27;s death at St Albans. Salisbury&#x27;s second son Sir Thomas Neville also died in the battle. Salisbury&#x27;s son in law William, Lord Harington, and Harington&#x27;s father, William Bonville, were captured and executed immediately after the battle. (The Bonvilles had been engaged in a feud with the Earl of Devon and the Courtenay family in Devon and Cornwall.) Salisbury himself escaped the battlefield but was captured during the night, and was taken to the Lancastrian camp. Although the Lancastrian nobles might have been prepared to allow Salisbury to ransom himself, he was dragged out of Pontefract Castle and beheaded by local commoners, to whom he had been a harsh overlord. The mob may have been led by the &quot;Bastard of Exeter&quot;, an illegitimate son of the Duke of Exeter.

Among the &quot;commoners&quot; in York&#x27;s army who were killed was John Harrowe, a prominent mercer of London, described as a &quot;captain of the foot&quot;.

==Aftermath==

After the battle the heads of York, Rutland and Salisbury were displayed over Micklegate Bar, the south-western gate through the York city walls, the Duke wearing a paper crown and a sign saying &quot;Let York overlook the town of York&quot;.

The death of Richard of York did not end the wars, or the House of York&#x27;s claim to the throne. The northern Lancastrian army which had been victorious at Wakefield was reinforced by Scots and borderers eager for plunder, and marched south. They defeated Warwick&#x27;s army at the Second Battle of St Albans and recaptured the feeble-minded King Henry, who had been abandoned on the battlefield for the third time, but were refused entry to London and failed to occupy the city. Warwick and Edward of March reoccupied London, and within a few weeks, Edward of March was proclaimed King Edward IV.

At the first Battle of St Albans, York had been content with the death of his rivals for power. At Wakefield and in every battle in the Wars of the Roses thereafter, the victors would eliminate not only any opposing leaders but also their family members and supporters, making the struggle more bitter and revenge driven.

A monument erected on the spot where the Duke of York is supposed to have perished is positioned slightly south of the more likely spot where an older monument once stood, but which was destroyed during the English Civil War. A cross in memory of York&#x27;s son, Rutland, was erected at the Park Street end of Kirkgate in Wakefield. Archaeologist Rachel Askew suggests that the memorial cross to the Duke of York may be fictional as the late-16th- and early-17th-century antiquarian John Camden did not mention it in his description of the location.

==In literature and folklore==
Many people are familiar with William Shakespeare&#x27;s melodramatic version of events in &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot;, notably the murder of Edmund of Rutland, although Edmund is depicted as a small child, and following his unnecessary slaughter by Clifford, Margaret torments his father, York, before murdering him also. In fact, Rutland, at seventeen, was more than old enough to be an active participant in the fighting. Margaret was almost certainly still in Scotland at the time.

The battle is said by some to be the source for the mnemonic for remembering the traditional colours of the rainbow, Richard Of York Gave Battle in Vain, and also the mocking nursery rhyme, &quot;The Grand Old Duke of York&quot;, although this much more likely refers to the eighteenth-century Duke of York, son of George III.

&quot;Dicky&#x27;s Meadow&quot;, a well-known Northern expression, is commonly believed to refer to Sandals Meadow, where the battle of Wakefield took place and where Richard met his end. The common view held that Richard was ill-advised to fight here. The expression is usually used to warn against risky action, as in &quot;If you do that you&#x27;ll end up in Dicky&#x27;s Meadow.&quot; However, the first known usage of that phrase did not appear until the 1860s, around 400 years after the battle took place.

<text>The Battle of Towton took place on 29 March 1461 during the Wars of the Roses, near Towton in North Yorkshire, and &quot;has the dubious distinction of being probably the largest and bloodiest battle on English soil&quot;. Fought for ten hours between an estimated 50,000 soldiers in a snowstorm on Palm Sunday, the Yorkist army achieved a decisive victory over their Lancastrian opponents. As a result, Edward IV deposed the Lancastrian Henry VI and secured the English throne.

Henry VI succeeded his father Henry V when he was nine months old in 1422, but was a weak, ineffectual and mentally unsound ruler, which encouraged the nobles to scheme for control over him. The situation deteriorated in the 1450s into a civil war between his Beaufort relatives and Queen Margaret of Anjou on one side, with those of his cousin Richard, Duke of York, on the other. In October 1460, Parliament passed the Act of Accord naming York as Henry&#x27;s successor, but neither the queen nor her Lancastrian allies would accept the disinheritance of her son, Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales. They raised a large army, which defeated and killed York and his second son Edmund at Wakefield in December. Financed by the City of London, York&#x27;s son and heir, Edward, found enough backing to denounce Henry and declare himself king. The Battle of Towton was to affirm the victor&#x27;s right through force of arms to rule over England.

On reaching the battlefield, the Yorkists found themselves heavily outnumbered, since part of their force under the Duke of Norfolk had yet to arrive. The Yorkist leader Lord Fauconberg turned the tables by ordering his archers to take advantage of the strong wind to outrange their enemies. The one-sided missile exchange, with Lancastrian arrows falling short of the Yorkist ranks, provoked the Lancastrians into abandoning their defensive positions. The ensuing hand-to-hand combat lasted hours, exhausting the combatants. The arrival of Norfolk&#x27;s men reinvigorated the Yorkists and, encouraged by Edward, they routed their foes. Many Lancastrians were killed while fleeing; some trampled one another and others drowned in the rivers, which are said to have run red with blood for several days. Several high-ranking prisoners were also executed.

The strength of the House of Lancaster was severely reduced as a result of this battle. Henry fled the country and many of his most powerful followers were dead or in exile after the engagement, leaving a new king, Edward IV, to rule England. In 1929 the Towton Cross was erected on the battlefield to commemorate the event. Various archaeological remains and mass graves related to the battle have been found in the area centuries after the engagement.

== Setting ==
In 1461 England was in the sixth year of the Wars of the Roses, a series of civil wars between the houses of York and Lancaster over the English throne. The Lancastrians backed the reigning King of England, Henry VI, a weak and indecisive man who suffered from intermittent bouts of madness. The leader of the Yorkists was initially Richard, Duke of York, who resented the dominance of a small number of aristocrats favoured by the king, principally the king&#x27;s close relatives, the Beaufort family. Fuelled by rivalries between influential supporters of both factions, York&#x27;s attempts to displace Henry&#x27;s favourites from power led to war. After capturing Henry at the Battle of Northampton in 1460, the duke, who was of royal blood, issued his claim to the throne. Even York&#x27;s closest supporters among the nobility were reluctant to usurp the dynasty; the nobles passed by a majority vote the Act of Accord, which ruled that the duke and his heirs would succeed to the throne upon Henry&#x27;s death.

The Queen of England, Margaret of Anjou, refused to accept an arrangement that deprived her son, Edward of Westminster, of his birthright. She had fled to Scotland after the Yorkist victory at Northampton; there she began raising an army, promising her followers the freedom to plunder on the march south through England. Her Lancastrian supporters also mustered in the north of England, preparing for her arrival. York marched with his army to meet this threat but he was lured into a trap at the Battle of Wakefield and killed. The duke and his second son, Edmund, Earl of Rutland, were decapitated by the Lancastrians and their heads were impaled on spikes atop the Micklegate Bar, a gatehouse of the city of York. The leadership of the House of York passed to the duke&#x27;s heir, Edward.
The victors of Wakefield were joined by Margaret&#x27;s army and marched south, plundering settlements along the way. They liberated Henry after defeating the Yorkist army of Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, in the Second Battle of St Albans and continued pillaging on their way to London. The city of London refused to open its gates to Henry and Margaret for fear of being looted. The Lancastrian army was short of supplies and had no adequate means to replenish them. When Margaret learned that Richard of York&#x27;s eldest son, Edward, Earl of March, and his army had won the Battle of Mortimer&#x27;s Cross in Herefordshire and were marching towards London, she withdrew the Lancastrians to York. Warwick and the remnants of his army marched from St Albans to join Edward&#x27;s men and the Yorkists were welcomed into London. Having lost custody of Henry, the Yorkists needed a justification to continue the rebellion against the king and his Lancastrian followers. On 4 March Warwick proclaimed the young Yorkist leader as King Edward IV. The proclamation gained greater acceptance than Richard of York&#x27;s earlier claim, as several nobles opposed to letting Edward&#x27;s father ascend the throne viewed the Lancastrian actions as a betrayal of the legally established Accord.

The country now had two kings; a situation that could not be allowed to persist, especially if Edward were to be formally crowned. Edward offered an amnesty to any Lancastrian supporter who renounced Henry. The move was intended to win over the commoners; his offer did not extend to wealthy Lancastrians (mostly the nobles). The young king summoned and ordered his followers to march towards York to take back his family&#x27;s city and to depose Henry formally through force of arms. The Yorkist army moved along three routes. Warwick&#x27;s uncle, Lord Fauconberg, led a group to clear the way to York for the main body, which was led by Edward. The Duke of Norfolk was sent east to raise forces and rejoin Edward before the battle. Warwick&#x27;s group moved to the west of the main body, through the Midlands, gathering men as they went. On 28 March, the leading elements of the Yorkist army came upon the remains of the crossing in Ferrybridge crossing the River Aire. They were rebuilding the bridge when they were attacked and routed by a band of about 500 Lancastrians, led by Lord Clifford.

Learning of the encounter, Edward led the main Yorkist army to the bridge and was forced into a gruelling battle: although the Yorkists were superior in numbers, the narrow bridge was a bottleneck, forcing them to confront Clifford&#x27;s men on equal terms. Edward sent Fauconberg and his horsemen to ford the river at Castleford, which should have been guarded by Henry, Earl of Northumberland, but he arrived late, by which time the Yorkists had crossed the ford and were heading to attack the Lancastrians at Ferrybridge from the flank. The Lancastrians retreated but were chased to Dinting Dale, where they were all killed, Clifford being slain by an arrow to his throat. Having cleared the vicinity of enemy forces, the Yorkists repaired the bridge and pressed onwards to camp overnight at Sherburn-in-Elmet. The Lancastrian army marched to Tadcaster, about north of Towton, and made camp. As dawn broke the two rival armies struck camp under dark skies and strong winds. Although it was Palm Sunday, a day of holy significance to Christians, the forces prepared for battle and a few documents named the engagement the Battle of &quot;Palme Sonday Felde&quot; but the name did not gain wide acceptance. Popular opinion favoured naming the battle after the village of Towton because of its proximity and it being the most prominent feature in the area.

== Force compositions ==
The armies gathered at Towton were among the largest at the time. Contemporary sources (like &quot;Gregory&#x27;s Chronicle&quot;) claimed that the soldiers on each side numbered in the hundreds of thousands. These figures are thought to be exaggerated, and modern historians believe that a combined figure of 50,000 – 65,000 is more likely, between one and two per cent of the English population at the time. An analysis of 50 skeletons found in mass graves between 1996 and 2003 showed most were 24 to 30 years old and many were veterans of previous engagements.

Henry&#x27;s physical and mental frailty was a major weakness for the Lancastrian cause, and he remained in York with Margaret. In contrast the 18-year-old Edward was a tall and imposing sight in armour and led from the front: his preference for bold offensive tactics determined the Yorkist plan of action for this engagement. His presence and example were crucial to ensuring the Yorkists held together through the long and exhausting struggle. 

Approximately three-quarters of English peers fought in the battle; eight were with the Yorkist army, whereas the Lancastrians had at least nineteen.

Of the other Yorkist leaders, Warwick was absent from the battle, having suffered a leg wound at Ferrybridge. Norfolk was too old to participate and his contingent was commanded by Walter Blount and Robert Horne; this may have been an advantage, since he was regarded as an unpredictable ally. Edward relied heavily on Warwick&#x27;s uncle, Lord Fauconberg, a veteran of the Anglo-French wars, highly regarded by contemporaries for his military skills. He demonstrated this in a wide range of roles, having captained the Calais garrison, led naval piracy expeditions in the Channel, and commanded the Yorkist vanguard at Northampton.

The senior Lancastrian general was Henry Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, an experienced leader credited with victories at Wakefield and St Albans, although others suggest they were due to Sir Andrew Trollope. Trollope was an extremely experienced and astute commander, who served under Warwick in Calais, before defecting to the Lancastrians at Ludford Bridge in 1459. Other notable Lancastrian leaders included Henry Holland, Duke of Exeter, and northern magnates the Earl of Northumberland, Lord de Ros and Lord Dacre. Another leading Lancastrian, Lord Clifford, had been killed by an arrow in the throat at Ferrybridge.

== Deployment ==
Very few historical sources give detailed accounts of the battle and they do not describe the exact deployments of the armies. The paucity of such primary sources led early historians to adopt Hall&#x27;s chronicle as their main resource for the engagement, despite its authorship 70 years after the event and questions over the origin of his information. The Burgundian chronicler Jean de Waurin (c. 1398 – c. 1474) was a more contemporary source, but his chronicle was made available to the public only from 1891, and several mistakes in it discouraged historians at that time from using it. Later reconstructions of the battle were based on Hall&#x27;s version, supplemented by minor details from other sources.

The battle took place on a plateau between the villages of Saxton (to the south) and Towton (to the north). The region was agricultural land, with plenty of wide open areas and small roads on which to manoeuvre the armies. Two roads ran through the area: the Old London Road, which connected Towton to the English capital, and a direct road between Saxton and Towton. The steeply banked Cock Beck flowed in an S-shaped course around the plateau from the north to west. The plateau was bisected by the Towton Dale, which ran from the west and extended into the North Acres in the east. Woodlands were scattered along the beck; Renshaw Woods lined the river on the north-western side of the plateau, and south of Towton Dale, Castle Hill Wood grew on the west side of the plateau at a bend in the beck. The area to the north-east of this forest would be known as Bloody Meadow after the battle.

According to Gravett and fellow military enthusiast Trevor James Halsall, Somerset&#x27;s decision to engage the Yorkist army on this plateau was sound. Defending the ground just before Towton would block any enemy advance towards the city of York, whether they moved along the London – Towton road or an old Roman road to the west. The Lancastrians deployed on the north side of the dale, using the valley as a &quot;protective ditch&quot;; the disadvantage of this position was that they could not see beyond the southern ridge of the dale. The Lancastrian flanks were protected by marshes; their right was further secured by the steep banks of the Cock Beck. The width of their deployment area did not allow for a longer front line, depriving the Lancastrians of the opportunity to use their numerical superiority. Waurin&#x27;s account gave rise to the suggestion that Somerset ordered a force of mounted spearmen to conceal itself in Castle Hill Wood, ready to charge into the Yorkist left flank at an opportune time in battle.

The Yorkists appeared as the Lancastrians finished deployment. Line after line of soldiers crested the southern ridge of the dale and formed up in ranks opposite their enemies as snow began to fall. Edward&#x27;s army was outnumbered and Norfolk&#x27;s troops had yet to arrive to join them. The Yorkist vanguard was commanded by Lord Fauconberg. Hall names John Wenlock and John Dinham and others as commanders of the Yorkist rearguard. Sources variously mention the Duke of Somerset, Trollope, the Earl of Northumberland and the Duke of Exeter as the commanders of the Lancastrian host, but show little agreement as to which portion of the host each of them was assigned.

== Fighting ==
As Somerset was content to stand and let his foes come to him, the opening move of the battle was made by the Yorkists. Noticing the direction and strength of the wind, Fauconberg ordered all Yorkist archers to step forward and unleash a volley of their arrows from what would be the standard maximum range of their longbows. With the wind behind them, the Yorkist missiles travelled farther than usual, plunging deep into the masses of soldiers on the hill slope.

The response from the Lancastrian archers was ineffective as the heavy wind blew snow in their faces. They found it difficult to judge the range and pick out their targets and their arrows fell short of the Yorkist ranks; Fauconberg had ordered his men to retreat after loosing one volley, thus avoiding any casualties. Unable to observe their results, the Lancastrians loosed their arrows until most had been used, leaving a thick, prickly carpet in the ground in front of the Yorkists.

After the Lancastrians had ceased loosing their arrows, Fauconberg ordered his archers to step forward again to shoot. When they had exhausted their ammunition, the Yorkists plucked arrows off the ground in front of them — arrows loosed by their foes — and continued shooting. Coming under attack without any effective response of its own, the Lancastrian army moved from its position to engage the Yorkists in close combat. Seeing the advancing mass of men, the Yorkist archers shot a few more volleys before retreating behind their ranks of men-at-arms, leaving thousands of arrows in the ground to hinder the Lancastrian attack.

As the Yorkists reformed their ranks to receive the Lancastrian charge, their left flank came under attack by the horsemen from Castle Hill Wood mentioned by Waurin. The Yorkist left wing fell into disarray and several men started to flee. Edward had to take command of the left wing to save the situation. By engaging in the fight and encouraging his followers, his example inspired many to stand their ground. The armies clashed and archers shot into the mass of men at short range. The Lancastrians continuously threw fresher men into the fray and gradually the numerically inferior Yorkist army was forced to give ground and retreat up the southern ridge. Gravett thought that the Lancastrian left had less momentum than the rest of its formation, skewing the line of battle such that its western end tilted towards Saxton.

The fighting continued for three hours, according to research by English Heritage, a government body in charge of conservation of historic sites. It was indecisive until the arrival of Norfolk&#x27;s men. Marching up the Old London Road, Norfolk&#x27;s contingent was hidden from view until they crested the ridge and attacked the Lancastrian left flank. The Lancastrians continued to give fight but the advantage had shifted to the Yorkists. By the end of the day, the Lancastrian line had broken up, as small groups of men began fleeing for their lives. Polydore Vergil, chronicler for Henry VII of England, said combat lasted for a total of 10 hours.

== Rout ==
The tired Lancastrians flung off their helmets and armour to run faster. Without such protection, they were much more vulnerable to the attacks of the Yorkists. Norfolk&#x27;s troops were much fresher and faster. Fleeing across what would later become known as Bloody Meadow, many Lancastrians were cut down from behind or were slain after they had surrendered. Before the battle, both sides had issued the order to give no quarter and the Yorkists were in no mood to spare anyone after the long, gruelling fight. A number of Lancastrians, such as Trollope, also had substantial bounties on their heads. Gregory&#x27;s chronicle stated 42 knights were killed after they were taken prisoner.

Archaeological findings in the late 20th century shed light on the final moments of the battle. In 1996 workmen at a construction site in the village of Towton uncovered a mass grave, which archaeologists believed to contain the remains of men who were slain during or after the battle in 1461. The bodies showed severe injuries to their upper torsos; arms and skulls were cracked or shattered. One exhumed specimen, known as Towton 25, had the front of his skull bisected: a weapon had slashed across his face, cutting a deep wound that split the bone. The skull was also pierced by another deep wound, a horizontal cut from a blade across the back. A detailed report of the excavation of the mass grave and other battle-related archaeology was published in 2000 under the title &#x27;Blood red roses - The Archaeology of a Mass Grave from the Battle of Towton AD 1461&#x27;.(https://www.oxbowbooks.com/9781842172896/blood-red-roses/)

The Lancastrians lost more troops in their rout than from the battlefield. Men struggling across the Cock Beck were dragged down by currents and drowned. Those floundering were stepped on and pushed under water by their comrades behind them as they rushed to get away from the Yorkists. As the Lancastrians struggled across the beck Yorkist archers rode to high vantage points and shot arrows at them. The dead began to pile up and the chronicles state that the Lancastrians eventually fled across these &quot;bridges&quot; of bodies. The chase continued northwards across the River Wharfe, which was larger than Cock Beck. A bridge over the river collapsed under the flood of men and many drowned trying to cross. Those who hid in Tadcaster and York were hunted down and killed.

A newsletter dated 4 April 1461 reported a widely circulated figure of 28,000 casualties in the battle, which Charles Ross and other historians believe was exaggerated. The number was taken from the heralds&#x27; estimate of the dead and appeared in letters from Edward and the Bishop of Salisbury, Richard Beauchamp. Letters from an ambassador and a merchant from the duchy of Milan broke this number down into 8,000 dead for the Yorkists and 20,000 for the Lancastrians; in contrast, bishops Nicholas O&#x27;Flanagan (Elphin) and Francesco Coppini reported only 800 dead Yorkists. Other contemporary sources gave higher numbers, ranging from 30,000 to 38,000; Hall quoted an exact figure of 36,776. An exception was the &quot;Annales rerum anglicarum&quot;, which stated the Lancastrians had 9,000 casualties, an estimate Ross and Wolffe found to be more believable. A more recent analysis of the sources and archaeological evidence, which posits that accounts of Towton were combined with those of the actions of Ferrybridge and Dintingdale, suggests total casualty figures in the range 2,800 – 3,800.

The Lancastrian nobility sustained heavy losses. The Earl of Northumberland, lords Welles, Mauley and Dacre, and Sir Andrew Trollope fell in battle, while the earls of Devon and Wiltshire were afterwards taken and executed. Lord Dacre was said to have been killed by an archer who was perched in a &quot;bur tree&quot; (a local term for an elder). In contrast, the Yorkists lost only one notable member of the gentry, Horne, at Towton.

== Aftermath ==
On receiving news of his army&#x27;s defeat, Henry fled into exile in Scotland with his wife and son. They were later joined by Somerset, Ros, Exeter, and the few Lancastrian nobles who escaped from the battlefield. The Battle of Towton severely reduced the power of the House of Lancaster in England; the linchpins of their power at court (Northumberland, Clifford, Ros, and Dacre) had either died or fled the country, ending the house&#x27;s domination over the north of England. Edward further exploited the situation, naming 14 Lancastrian peers as traitors. Approximately 96 Lancastrians of the rank of knight and below were also attainted: 24 of them members of parliament.

The new king preferred winning over his enemies to his cause; the nobles he attainted either died in the battle or had refused to submit to him. The estates of a few of these nobles were confiscated by the crown but the rest were untouched, remaining in the care of their families. Edward also pardoned many of those he attainted after they submitted to his rule.

Although Henry was at large in Scotland with his son, the battle put an end (for the time being) to disputes over the country&#x27;s state of leadership since the Act of Accord. The English people were assured that there was now one true king; Edward. He turned his attention to consolidating his rule over the country, winning over the people and putting down the rebellions raised by the few remaining Lancastrian diehards. He knighted several of his supporters and elevated several of his gentry supporters to the peerage; Fauconberg was made the Earl of Kent. Warwick benefited from Edward&#x27;s rule after the battle. He received parts of Northumberland&#x27;s and Clifford&#x27;s holdings, and was made &quot;the king&#x27;s lieutenant in the North and admiral of England.&quot; Edward bestowed on him many offices of power and wealth, further enhancing the earl&#x27;s considerable influence and riches.

By 1464, the Yorkists had &quot;wiped out all effective Lancastrian resistance in the north of England.&quot; Edward&#x27;s reign was not interrupted until 1470; by then, his relationship with Warwick had deteriorated to such an extent that the earl defected to the Lancastrians and forced Edward to flee England, restoring Henry to the throne. The interruption of Yorkist rule was brief, as Edward regained his throne after defeating Warwick and his Lancastrian cohorts at the Battle of Barnet in 1471.

== Literature ==


In the sixteenth century William Shakespeare wrote a number of dramatisations of historic figures. The use of history as a backdrop, against which the familiar characters act out Shakespeare&#x27;s drama, lends a sense of realism to his plays. Shakespeare wrote a three-part play about Henry VI, relying heavily on Hall&#x27;s chronicle as a source. His vision of the Battle of Towton (&quot;Henry VI&quot;, Part 3, Act 2, Scene 5), touted as the &quot;bloodiest&quot; engagement in the Wars of the Roses, became a set piece about the &quot;terror of civil war, a &quot;national&quot; terror that is essentially &quot;familial&quot;&quot;. Historian Bertram Wolffe said it was thanks to Shakespeare&#x27;s dramatisation of the battle that the weak and ineffectual Henry was at least remembered by English society, albeit for his pining to have been born a shepherd rather than a king.

Shakespeare&#x27;s version of the battle presents a notable scene that comes immediately after Henry&#x27;s soliloquy. Henry witnesses the laments of two soldiers in the battle. One slays his opponent in hope of plunder, only to find the victim is his son; the other kills his enemy, who turns out to be his father. Both killers have acted out of greed and fell into a state of deep grieving after discovering their misdeeds. Shakespearian scholar Arthur Percival Rossiter names the scene as the most notable of the playwright&#x27;s written &quot;rituals&quot;. The delivery of the event follows the pattern of an opera: after a long speech, the actors alternate among one another to deliver single-line asides to the audience. In this scene of grief, in a reversal of the approach adopted in his later historical plays, Shakespeare uses anonymous fictional characters to illustrate the ills of civil war while a historical king reflects on their fates. Michael Hattaway, emeritus professor of English Literature at the University of Sheffield, comments that Shakespeare intended to show Henry&#x27;s sadness over the war, to elicit the same emotion among the audience and to expose Henry&#x27;s ineptitude as king.

The Battle of Towton was re-examined by Geoffrey Hill in his poem &quot;Funeral Music&quot; (1968). Hill presents the historical event through the voices of its combatants, looking at the turmoil of the era through their eyes. The common soldiers grouse about their physical discomforts and the sacrifices that they had made for the ideas glorified by their leaders. They share their superiors&#x27; determination to seek the destruction of their opponents, even at the cost of their lives. Hill depicts the participants&#x27; belief that the event was pre-destined and of utmost importance as a farce; the world went about its business regardless of the Battle of Towton.

An episode in C. J. Sansom’s historical novel &quot;Sovereign&quot;, set in 1541, sixty years after the battle, concerns a Towton farmer appealing to King Henry VIII to be compensated for the time and effort he has to spend on turning over to the Church the skeletons discovered nearly every day on his land.

== Legacy ==

Obtaining an accurate figure for casualties has been complicated: remains were either moved or used by farmers as fertiliser, and corpses were generally stripped of clothing and non-perishable items before burial. However some survived when later buildings were constructed over their graves; the first were uncovered in 1996 and excavations have so far uncovered more than 50 skeletons from the battle. An analysis of their injuries shows the brutality of the contest, including extensive post-mortem mutilations.

15th-century documents confirm some casualties were reburied in graveyards at Saxton and a chapel constructed for the purpose by Richard III in 1484. His death at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 meant the building was never completed and eventually collapsed. In 1929 stones allegedly from the chapel were used to create the Towton Cross, also known as Lord Dacre&#x27;s Cross, which commemorates those who died in the battle.

Lord Dacre was buried at the church of All Saints in Saxton and his tomb was reported in the late 19th century to be well maintained, although several of its panels had been weathered away. The tree from which Dacre&#x27;s killer was supposed to have shot his arrow had been cut down by the late 19th century. In 2010 fragments from what are some of the earliest known handguns found in Britain were discovered on the battlefield.

Views of the Wars of the Roses in general and of the battle as a charnel house were formed by Shakespeare and endured for centuries. However at the start of the 21st century the battle was no longer prominent in the public consciousness. Journalists lamented that people were ignorant of the Battle of Towton and of its significance. According to English Heritage the battle was of the &quot;greatest importance&quot;: it was one of the largest, if not &quot;the&quot; largest, fought in England and resulted in the replacement of one royal dynasty by another. Hill expressed a different opinion. Although impressed with the casualty figures touted by the chroniclers, he believed the battle brought no monumental changes to the lives of the English people.

The Battle of Towton was associated with a tradition previously upheld in the village of Tysoe, Warwickshire. For several centuries a local farmer had scoured a hill figure, the Red Horse of Tysoe, each year, as part of the terms of his land tenancy. Although the origins of the tradition have never been conclusively identified, it was locally said this was done to commemorate the Earl of Warwick&#x27;s inspirational deed of slaying his horse to show his resolve to stand and fight with the common soldiers. The tradition died in 1798 when the Tysoe Inclosure Act 1796 (36 Geo. 3. c. &quot;31&quot; ) was implemented redesignated the common land on which the equine figure was located as private property. The scouring was revived during the early 20th century but has since stopped.

<doc id="50237" wikidata="Q43393" url="?curid=50237" title="Robert Boyle">
<text>Robert Boyle (; 25 January 1627 – 31 December 1691) was an Anglo-Irish natural philosopher, chemist, physicist, alchemist and inventor. Boyle is largely regarded today as the first modern chemist, and therefore one of the founders of modern chemistry, and one of the pioneers of modern experimental scientific method. He is best known for Boyle&#x27;s law, which describes the inversely proportional relationship between the absolute pressure and volume of a gas, if the temperature is kept constant within a closed system. Among his works, &quot;The Sceptical Chymist&quot; is seen as a cornerstone book in the field of chemistry. He was a devout and pious Anglican and is noted for his works in theology.

==Biography==
===Early years===

Boyle was born at Lismore Castle, in County Waterford, Ireland, the seventh son and fourteenth child of The 1st Earl of Cork (&#x27;the Great Earl of Cork&#x27;) and Catherine Fenton. Lord Cork, then known simply as Richard Boyle, had arrived in Dublin from England in 1588 during the Tudor plantations of Ireland and obtained an appointment as a deputy escheator. He had amassed enormous wealth and landholdings by the time Robert was born and had been made Earl of Cork in October 1620. Catherine Fenton, Countess of Cork, was the daughter of Sir Geoffrey Fenton, the former Secretary of State for Ireland, who was born in Dublin in 1539, and Alice Weston, the daughter of Robert Weston, who was born in Lismore in 1541.

As a child, Boyle was raised by a wet nurse, as were his elder brothers. Boyle received private tutoring in Latin, Greek, and French and when he was eight years old, following the death of his mother, he, and his brother Francis, were sent to Eton College in England. His father&#x27;s friend, Sir Henry Wotton, was then the provost of the college.

During this time, his father hired a private tutor, Robert Carew, who had knowledge of Irish, to act as a private tutor to his sons in Eton. However, &quot;only Mr. Robert sometimes desires it [Irish] and is a little entered in it&quot;, but despite the &quot;many reasons&quot; given by Carew to draw their attention to it, &quot;they practise the French and Latin but they affect not the Irish&quot;. After spending over three years at Eton, Robert travelled abroad with a French tutor. They visited Italy in 1641 and remained in Florence during the winter of that year studying the &quot;paradoxes of the great star-gazer&quot;, the elderly Galileo Galilei.

===Middle years===

Robert returned to England from continental Europe in mid-1644 with a keen interest in scientific research. His father, Lord Cork, had died the previous year and had left him the manor of Stalbridge in Dorset as well as substantial estates in County Limerick in Ireland that he had acquired. Robert then made his residence at Stalbridge House, between 1644 and 1652, and settled in a laboratory where he conducted many experiments. From that time, Robert devoted his life to scientific research and soon took a prominent place in the band of enquirers, known as the &quot;Invisible College&quot;, who devoted themselves to the cultivation of the &quot;new philosophy&quot;. They met frequently in London, often at Gresham College, and some of the members also had meetings at Oxford.
Having made several visits to his Irish estates beginning in 1647, Robert moved to Ireland in 1652 but became frustrated at his inability to make progress in his chemical work. In one letter, he described Ireland as &quot;a barbarous country where chemical spirits were so misunderstood and chemical instruments so unprocurable that it was hard to have any Hermetic thoughts in it.&quot;

All Souls, Oxford University, shows the arms of Boyle&#x27;s family in the colonnade of the Great Quadrangle, opposite the arms of the Hill family of Shropshire, close by a sundial designed by Boyle&#x27;s friend Christopher Wren.

In 1654, Boyle left Ireland for Oxford to pursue his work more successfully. An inscription can be found on the wall of University College, Oxford, the High Street at Oxford (now the location of the Shelley Memorial), marking the spot where Cross Hall stood until the early 19th century. It was here that Boyle rented rooms from the wealthy apothecary who owned the Hall.

Reading in 1657 of Otto von Guericke&#x27;s air pump, he set himself, with the assistance of Robert Hooke, to devise improvements in its construction. Guericke&#x27;s air pump was large and the evacuation of the air required &quot;the continual labour of two strong men for divers hours&quot;. Hooke constructed a pump that could be operated on a desktop, and conveniently opened to insert candles, small animals, bells, pendulums, and other research objects. With the result, the &quot;machina Boyleana&quot; or &quot;Pneumatical Engine&quot;, finished in 1659, he began a series of experiments on the properties of air and coined the term factitious airs. An account of Boyle&#x27;s work with the air pump was published in 1660 under the title &quot;New Experiments Physico-Mechanical, Touching the Spring of the Air, and its Effects&quot;.

Among the critics of the views put forward in this book was a Jesuit, Francis Line (1595–1675), and it was while answering his objections that Boyle made his first mention of the law that the volume of a gas varies inversely to the pressure of the gas, which among English-speaking people is usually called &quot;Boyle&#x27;s law&quot;, after his name. The person who originally formulated the hypothesis was Henry Power in 1661. Boyle in 1662 included a reference to a paper written by Power, but mistakenly attributed it to Richard Towneley. In continental Europe, the hypothesis is sometimes attributed to Edme Mariotte, although he did not publish it until 1676 and was probably aware of Boyle&#x27;s work at the time.

In 1663 the Invisible College became The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge, and the charter of incorporation granted by Charles II of England named Boyle a member of the council. In 1680 he was elected president of the society but declined the honour from a scruple about oaths.

He made a &quot;wish list&quot; of 24 possible inventions which included &quot;the prolongation of life&quot;, the &quot;art of flying&quot;, &quot;perpetual light&quot;, &quot;making armour light and extremely hard&quot;, &quot;a ship to sail with all winds, and a ship not to be sunk&quot;, &quot;practicable and certain way of finding longitudes&quot;, &quot;potent drugs to alter or exalt imagination, waking, memory and other functions and appease pain, procure innocent sleep, harmless dreams, etc.&quot;. All but a few of the 24 have come true.

In 1668 he left Oxford for London where he resided at the house of his elder sister Katherine Jones, Lady Ranelagh, in Pall Mall. He experimented in the laboratory she had in her home and attended her salon of intellectuals interested in the sciences. The siblings maintained &quot;a lifelong intellectual partnership, where brother and sister shared medical remedies, promoted each other&#x27;s scientific ideas, and edited each other&#x27;s manuscripts.&quot; His contemporaries widely acknowledged Katherine&#x27;s influence on his work, but later historiographers dropped discussion of her accomplishments and relationship to her brother from their histories.

===Later years===

In 1669 his health, never very strong, began to fail seriously and he gradually withdrew from his public engagements, ceasing his communications to the Royal Society, and advertising his desire to be excused from receiving guests, &quot;unless upon occasions very extraordinary&quot;, on Tuesday and Friday forenoon, and Wednesday and Saturday afternoon. In the leisure thus gained he wished to &quot;recruit his spirits, range his papers&quot;, and prepare some important chemical investigations which he proposed to leave &quot;as a kind of Hermetic legacy to the studious disciples of that art&quot;, but of which he did not make known the nature. His health became still worse in 1691, and he died on 31 December that year, just a week after the death of his sister, Katherine, in whose home he had lived and with whom he had shared scientific pursuits for more than twenty years. Boyle died from paralysis. He was buried in the churchyard of St Martin-in-the-Fields, his funeral sermon being preached by his friend, Bishop Gilbert Burnet. In his will, Boyle endowed a series of lectures that came to be known as the Boyle Lectures.

==Scientific investigator==
 Boyle&#x27;s great merit as a scientific investigator is that he carried out the principles which Francis Bacon espoused in the &quot;Novum Organum&quot;. Yet he would not avow himself a follower of Bacon, or indeed of any other teacher.

=== Emphasis on experiments ===
On several occasions, he mentions that to keep his judgment as unprepossessed as might be with any of the modern theories of philosophy, until he was &quot;provided of experiments&quot; to help him judge of them. He refrained from any study of the atomical and the Cartesian systems, and even of the Novum Organum itself, though he admits to &quot;transiently consulting&quot; them about a few particulars. Nothing was more alien to his mental temperament than the spinning of hypotheses. &quot;I, ... love not to believe any thing upon Conjectures, when by a not over-difficult Experiment I can try whether it be True or no...&quot;

He regarded the acquisition of knowledge as an end in itself, and in consequence, he gained a wider outlook on the aims of scientific inquiry than had been enjoyed by his predecessors for many centuries. This, however, did not mean that he paid no attention to the practical application of science nor that he despised knowledge which tended to use.
=== Alchemy ===
Robert Boyle was an alchemist; and believing the of metals to be a possibility, he carried out experiments in the hope of achieving it; and he was instrumental in obtaining the repeal, by the Royal Mines Act 1688 (1 Will. &amp; Mar. c. 30), of the statute of Henry IV against multiplying gold and silver, the Gold and Silver Act 1403 (5 Hen. 4. c. 4). With all the important work he accomplished in physics – the enunciation of Boyle&#x27;s law, the discovery of the part taken by air in the propagation of sound, and investigations on the expansive force of freezing water, on specific gravities and refractive powers, on crystals, on electricity, on colour, on hydrostatics, etc. – chemistry was his peculiar and favourite study. His first book on the subject was &quot;The Sceptical Chymist&quot;, published in 1661, in which he criticised the &quot;experiments whereby vulgar Spagyrists are wont to endeavour to evince their Salt, Sulphur and Mercury to be the true Principles of Things&quot;. For him, chemistry was the science of the composition of substances, not merely an adjunct to the arts of the alchemist or the physician.

He endorsed the view of elements as the undecomposable constituents of material bodies; and made the distinction between mixtures and compounds. He made considerable progress in the technique of detecting their ingredients, a process which he designated by the term &quot;analysis&quot;. He further supposed that the elements were ultimately composed of particles of various sorts and sizes, into which, however, they were not to be resolved in any known way. He studied the chemistry of combustion and of respiration, and conducted experiments in physiology, where, however, he was hampered by the &quot;tenderness of his nature&quot; which kept him from anatomical dissections, especially vivisections, though he knew them to be &quot;most instructing&quot;.

==Theological interests==
In addition to philosophy, Boyle devoted much time to theology, showing a very decided leaning to the practical side and an indifference to controversial polemics. At the Restoration of Charles II of England in 1660, he was favourably received at court and in 1665 would have received the provostship of Eton College had he agreed to take holy orders, but this he refused to do on the ground that his writings on religious subjects would have greater weight coming from a layman than a paid minister of the Church.

Moreover, Boyle incorporated his scientific interests into his theology, believing that natural philosophy could provide powerful evidence for the existence of God. In works such as &quot;Disquisition about the Final Causes of Natural Things&quot; (1688), for instance, he criticised contemporary philosophers – such as René Descartes – who denied that the study of nature could reveal much about God. Instead, Boyle argued that natural philosophers could use the design apparently on display in some parts of nature to demonstrate God&#x27;s involvement with the world. He also attempted to tackle complex theological questions using methods derived from his scientific practices. In &quot;Some Physico-Theological Considerations about the Possibility of the Resurrection&quot; (1675), he used a chemical experiment known as the reduction to the pristine state as part of an attempt to demonstrate the physical possibility of the resurrection of the body. Throughout his career, Boyle tried to show that science could lend support to Christianity.

As a director of the East India Company he spent large sums in promoting the spread of Christianity in the East, contributing liberally to missionary societies and to the expenses of translating the Bible or portions of it into various languages. Boyle supported the policy that the Bible should be available in the vernacular language of the people. An Irish language version of the New Testament was published in 1602 but was rare in Boyle&#x27;s adult life. In 1680–85 Boyle personally financed the printing of the Bible, both Old and New Testaments, in Irish. In this respect, Boyle&#x27;s attitude to the Irish language differed from the Protestant Ascendancy class in Ireland at the time, which was generally hostile to the language and largely opposed the use of Irish (not only as a language of religious worship).

Boyle also had a monogenist perspective about race origin. He was a pioneer in studying races, and he believed that all human beings, no matter how diverse their physical differences, came from the same source: Adam and Eve. He studied reported stories of parents giving birth to different coloured albinos, so he concluded that Adam and Eve were originally white and that Caucasians could give birth to different coloured races. Boyle also extended the theories of Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton about colour and light via optical projection (in physics) into discourses of polygenesis, speculating that maybe these differences were due to &quot;seminal impressions&quot;. Taking this into account, it might be considered that he envisioned a good explanation for complexion at his time, due to the fact that now we know that skin colour is disposed of by genes, which are contained in the semen. Boyle&#x27;s writings mention that at his time, for &quot;European Eyes&quot;, beauty was not measured so much in colour of skin, but in &quot;stature, comely symmetry of the parts of the body, and good features in the face&quot;. Various members of the scientific community rejected his views and described them as &quot;disturbing&quot; or &quot;amusing&quot;.

In his will, Boyle provided money for a series of lectures to defend the Christian religion against those he considered &quot;notorious infidels, namely atheists, deists, pagans, Jews and Muslims&quot;, with the provision that controversies between Christians were not to be mentioned (see Boyle Lectures).

== Awards and honours ==

As a founder of the Royal Society, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1663. Boyle&#x27;s law is named in his honour. The Royal Society of Chemistry issues a Robert Boyle Prize for Analytical Science, named in his honour. The Boyle Medal for Scientific Excellence in Ireland, inaugurated in 1899, is awarded jointly by the Royal Dublin Society and The Irish Times. Launched in 2012, The Robert Boyle Summer School organized by the Waterford Institute of Technology with support from Lismore Castle, is held annually to honor the heritage of Robert Boyle.

<doc id="50239" wikidata="Q209539" url="?curid=50239" title="Led Zeppelin II">
<text>Led Zeppelin II is the second studio album by the English rock band Led Zeppelin, released on 22 October 1969 in the United States and on 31 October 1969 in the United Kingdom by Atlantic Records. Recording sessions for the album took place at several locations in both the United Kingdom and North America from January to August 1969. The album&#x27;s production was credited to the band&#x27;s lead guitarist and songwriter Jimmy Page, and it was also Led Zeppelin&#x27;s first album on which Eddie Kramer served as engineer.

The album exhibited the band&#x27;s evolving musical style of blues-derived material and their guitar riff-based sound. It has been described as the band&#x27;s heaviest album. Six of the nine songs were written by the band, while the other three were reinterpretations of Chicago blues songs by Willie Dixon and Howlin&#x27; Wolf. One single, &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot;, was released outside of the UK (the band would release no UK singles during their career), and peaked as a top-ten single in over a dozen markets around the world.

&quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot; was a commercial success, and was the band&#x27;s first album to reach number one on charts in the UK and the US. The album&#x27;s cover designer David Juniper was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Recording Package in 1970. On 15 November 1999, the album was certified 12× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales reaching 12 million copies in the US. Since its release, various writers and music critics have cited &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot; as one of the greatest and most influential albums of all time.

==Background==
&quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot; was conceived during a busy period of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s career from January through August 1969, when they completed four European and three American concert tours. Each song was separately recorded, mixed and produced at various studios in the UK and North America. The album was written on tour, during periods of a couple of hours in between concerts, a studio was booked and the recording process begun, necessarily resulting in spontaneity and urgency, which is reflected in the sound. Several songs resulted from improvisation while touring, including during the instrumental sections of &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, and were recorded mostly live in the studio.

Recording sessions for the album took place at a wide variety of studios in the UK and US, including Olympic and Morgan Studios in London, England; A&amp;M, Quantum, Sunset, Mirror Sound and Mystic Studios in Los Angeles; Ardent Studios in Memphis, Tennessee; A&amp;R, Juggy Sound, Groove and Mayfair Studios in New York City; and R&amp;D Studios. Some of these were ill-equipped, leading to one Vancouver studio, which had an 8-track set-up without even proper headphone facilities, being credited as &quot;a hut&quot;. A more favourable set-up was Mystic Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles with Chris Huston engineering. 

Lead singer Robert Plant later complained that the writing, recording, and mixing sessions were done in many different locations, and criticised the writing and recording process. &quot;Thank You&quot;, &quot;The Lemon Song&quot; and &quot;Moby Dick&quot; were overdubbed during the tour, while the mixing of &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; and &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; was also done on tour. Page later stated, &quot;In other words, some of the material came out of rehearsing for the next tour and getting new material together.&quot;

Page and Kramer spent two days mixing the album at A&amp;R Studios, and the album&#x27;s production was entirely credited to Jimmy Page, with Eddie Kramer engineering. Kramer was quoted as saying, &quot;The famous &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; mix, where everything is going bananas, is a combination of Jimmy and myself just flying around on a small console twiddling every knob known to man.&quot; Kramer later gave great credit to Page for the sound that was achieved, despite the inconsistent conditions in which it was recorded: &quot;We cut some of the tracks in some of the most bizarre studios you can imagine ... but in the end it sounded bloody marvellous ... there was one guy in charge and that was Mr. Page.&quot;

==Music and lyrics==
The finished tracks reflect the evolving sound of the band and their live performances. Plant had his first songwriting credits on &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot;; he had been unable to have his contributions to the writing process credited for the first album because of a prior contract with CBS Records.

===Side one===
&quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; was built around a five-note Page riff. Parts of the lyrics were taken directly from Willie Dixon&#x27;s &quot;You Need Love&quot;, which led to the group being sued for plagiarism, eventually settling out of court. The arrangement also resembles the Small Faces track &quot;You Need Loving&quot;. With basic tracks recorded on Page&#x27;s houseboat, the middle section of the song contained a variety of overdubbed instruments and vocals which were mixed live by Page and Kramer, making full use of stereo panning and other controls available on the desk. The song was edited down to a single in the US, where it became a top 5 hit. In the UK, a single release was cancelled; the group never issued any singles there during their active career together. It was finally issued as a single in 1997. A mainly instrumental version of the song was recorded by CCS and was used as the theme tune to the BBC TV show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, ensuring it was well known by virtually everyone in Britain.

Led Zeppelin performed &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; at every gig from June 1969 onwards. It was the closing number of their live shows between 1970 and 1973, often extended to incorporate a rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll medley towards the end of the set. A different arrangement of the song was played for the Knebworth Fayre concerts in 1979. It was the last song the group ever performed live with drummer John Bonham, on 7 July 1980. &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; has since been critically praised as one of the definitive heavy metal tracks, though the group have never considered themselves to fit that specific style.

&quot;What Is and What Should Never Be&quot; was primarily written by Plant. It features a variety of dynamics during the track, along with flanged vocals and wide-panned stereo guitars.

&quot;The Lemon Song&quot; was a re-arrangement of Howlin&#x27; Wolf&#x27;s &quot;Killing Floor&quot;, which had become a regular part of the group&#x27;s live show during 1969. It was mostly recorded live and expanded to include new lyrics, including the sexually-charged phrase &quot;squeeze my lemon&quot; which was borrowed from Robert Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Travelling Riverside Blues&quot;, which the band had played for the BBC radio show &quot;Top Gear&quot; broadcast on 29 June 1969.

&quot;Thank You&quot; was written by Plant as a love song to his wife, Maureen. Page played twelve-string guitar and Jones played Hammond organ on the track.

===Side two===
&quot;Heartbreaker&quot; was mostly written by Page as a showcase for his guitar skills, including an unaccompanied solo in the middle of the song. It quickly became a live favourite, being performed regularly from October 1969 onwards, and throughout the group&#x27;s career.

&quot;Living Loving Maid (She&#x27;s Just a Woman)&quot; was purported to be written about a groupie the band encountered while touring the US. The group disliked the track, considering it to be little more than filler, and consequently it was never played live by the group. Plant performed the track live on his 1990 solo tour.

&quot;Ramble On&quot; was written by Plant. The lyrics were inspired by J. R. R. Tolkien, and similar themes appeared on subsequent Led Zeppelin albums. The track made good use of dynamics, moving from a quiet acoustic guitar in the opening, to a variety of overdubbed electric guitars towards the end. It was never performed live by Led Zeppelin during their main career, but Plant has performed the song regularly on solo tours, and it was part of Page and Plant&#x27;s live set in the mid-1990s. It was finally performed live for the first time by Led Zeppelin at the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in 2007.

&quot;Moby Dick&quot; was designed as a showcase for Bonham&#x27;s drum solo. A previous drum showpiece featured a different arrangement called &quot;Pat&#x27;s Delight&quot; (after his wife). Moby Dick is in drop D tuning and features a variety of drums and percussive instruments played with bare hands as well as drumsticks. It was a regular part of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s live show, developing to include additional percussion and electronic drums.

&quot;Bring It On Home&quot; was a cover of a Willie Dixon song originally performed by Sonny Boy Williamson II. Led Zeppelin&#x27;s arrangement includes a faster middle section in addition to the straightforward blues structure of the original. It was played live regularly throughout late 1969 and 1970.

==Artwork==

The album sleeve design was from a poster by David Juniper, who was simply told by the band to come up with an interesting idea. Juniper was a fellow student of Page&#x27;s at Sutton Art College in Surrey.

Juniper&#x27;s design was based on a photograph of the Jagdstaffel 11 Division of the German Air Force during World War I, the Flying Circus led by the Red Baron. Juniper replaced four of the flyers&#x27; heads with photos of the band members, added facial hair and sunglasses to some of the flyers&#x27; faces or replaced some with the faces of other people. The blonde-haired woman is French actress Delphine Seyrig in her role as Marie-Madeleine in the film &quot;Mr. Freedom&quot;, a leftist anti-war satire by William Klein. The cover also pictured the outline of a Zeppelin on a brown background (similar to the cover of the band&#x27;s first album), which gave the album its nickname &quot;Brown Bomber&quot;.

==Release and reception==
The album was released on 22 October 1969 on Atlantic Records, with advance orders of 400,000 copies. The advertising campaign was built around the slogans &#x27;Led Zeppelin – The Only Way to Fly&#x27; and &#x27;Led Zeppelin II Now Flying&#x27;. In the United States, some commercially duplicated reel-to-reel copies of &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot; made by Ampex bore the title &quot;Led Zeppelin II – The Only Way to Fly&quot; on their spine. Commercially, &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot; was the band&#x27;s first album to hit No. 1 in the US, knocking The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Abbey Road&quot; (1969) twice from the top spot, where it remained for seven weeks. By April 1970 it had registered three million American sales, whilst in Britain it enjoyed a 138-week residence on the LP chart, climbing to the top spot in February 1970. Meanwhile, the album reached the top spot in other 5 national albums charts (including Canadian, Australian and Spanish albums charts). In November Ritchie Yorke reported in &quot;Billboard&quot; that while the album had achieved &quot;staggering&quot; sales, as a hard rock record it was considered unsuitable for North American Top 40 radio stations, who were &quot;dreary and detached from the mainstream of contemporary rock music&quot;.

The album also yielded Led Zeppelin&#x27;s biggest hit, &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot;. This song reached No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in January 1970, after Atlantic went against the group&#x27;s wishes by releasing a shorter version on 45. The single&#x27;s B-side, &quot;Living Loving Maid (She&#x27;s Just a Woman)&quot;, also hit the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, peaking at No. 65 in April 1970. The album helped establish Led Zeppelin as an international concert attraction, and for the next year, the group continued to tour relentlessly, initially performing in clubs and ballrooms, then in larger auditoriums and eventually stadiums as their popularity grew.

&quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot; was not well-received by contemporary music critics. John Mendelsohn wrote a negative review of the record for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, in which he mocked the group&#x27;s heavy sound and white blues, while writing that &quot;until you&#x27;ve listened to the album eight hundred times, as I have, it seems as if it&#x27;s just one especially heavy song extended over the space of two whole sides&quot;. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau jokingly referred to the band as &quot;the best of the wah-wah groups, so dirty they drool on demand&quot;, while complaining that &quot;all the songs sound alike&quot;, before assigning the album a &quot;B&quot; grade. He nonetheless conceded in 1970 that &quot;Led Zeppelin simply out-heavied everyone&quot; the previous year, &quot;pitting Jimmy Page&#x27;s repeated low-register fuzz riffs against the untiring freak intensity of Robert Plant&#x27;s vocal. This trademark has only emerged clearly on the second album, and more and more I am coming to understand it as an artistic triumph.&quot;

On 10 November 1969, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America and in 1990 it was certified 5× platinum reflecting shipping of five million copies. By 14 November 1999, &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot; had shipped twelve million copies and was certified 12× platinum by the RIAA. The 2014 reissue of the album helped itself get back into the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 10 when it got to .

==Legacy and reappraisal==

&quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot; has since been regarded as the quintessential hard rock and heavy metal album. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine said it &quot;provided the blueprint for all the heavy metal bands that followed it&quot;. While crediting the band for essentially inventing metal, Tom Hull said that, after the first album had declared their musical ambition, &quot;the second honed it down to a singular entity, a sound&quot;, with subsequent albums expanding on it in &quot;sophisticated, subtler, often quite intelligent&quot; ways, but still indebted to &quot;the basic dumbness&quot; of &quot;II&quot; – &quot;dumb not in the sense of stupid but of non-speaking. Lyrics are there of course, but as an integral part of the music, a music better appropriated tactilely, through incoherent sensation, than intellectually, literarily.&quot;

The album was described as a &quot;brilliant if heavy-handed blues-rock offensive&quot;, by popular music scholar Ronald Zalkind. According to Robert Santelli&#x27;s &quot;The Big Book of Blues: A Biographical Encyclopedia&quot; (2001), Led Zeppelin &quot;had already begun to move beyond its blues-rock influences, venturing into previously unexplored hard-rock territories&quot;. Blues-derived songs like &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot;, &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, &quot;The Lemon Song&quot;, &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, and &quot;Bring It On Home&quot; have been seen as representing standards of the metal genre, where the guitar-based riff (rather than vocal chorus or verses) defines the song and provides the key hook. Such arrangements and emphasis were at the time atypical in popular music. Page&#x27;s guitar solo in &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; was an influence on later renowned guitarists Eddie Van Halen, as inspiration for his two-handed tapping technique, and Steve Vai.

Since its initial critical reception, &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot; has earned several accolades from music publications, being ranked on critics&#x27; &quot;best album&quot; lists. In 1989, &quot;Spin&quot; magazine ranked the album No. 5 on its list of &quot;The 25 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. In 1990, &quot;CD Review&quot; ranked it sixth on their list of top 50 CDs for starting a &quot;pop/rock&quot; library; an accompanying blurb described the album as &quot;white boy blues with a hard rock edge&quot;. In 2000, &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot; at number 37 in its list of the &quot;100 Greatest British Albums Ever&quot;. In 2003, the album was ranked number 75 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, 79 in a 2012 revised list, and 123 in a 2020 revised list. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==2014 reissue==
Along with the group&#x27;s self-titled debut album and their third album, &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot;, the album was remastered and reissued on 2 June 2014. The reissue comes in six formats: a standard CD edition, a deluxe two-CD edition, a standard LP version, a deluxe two-LP version, a super deluxe two-CD plus two-LP version with a hardback book, and as high-resolution, 24-bit/96k digital downloads. The deluxe and super deluxe editions feature bonus material containing alternative takes, backing tracks and the previously unreleased instrumental, &quot;La La&quot;. The reissue was released with an altered colour version of the original album&#x27;s artwork as its bonus disc&#x27;s cover.

The reissue was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 95, based on 10 reviews. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; journalist Mark Richardson said, &quot;the reissue sounds as thrilling as ever&quot;, while Julian Marszalek of &quot;The Quietus&quot; noted the bonus disc&#x27;s &quot;intriguing insight&quot; into the original record&#x27;s creation. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, David Fricke wrote, &quot;the alternate takes highlight Robert Plant&#x27;s ripening vocal poise and, in a rough mix of &#x27;Ramble On&#x27;, the decisive, melodic force of John Paul Jones&#x27; bass and John Bonham&#x27;s drumming.&quot; &quot;As a two-disc set&quot;, &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot;″s Michael Madden wrote, &quot;this reissue is both a reminder of the original album&#x27;s wallop and a closer look at the alchemy of a band increasingly attuned to ideas of progression.&quot; Raoul Hernandez from &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; was more critical of the bonus disc, finding it to be &quot;the thinnest of extras&quot; offered by the reissue program.

<doc id="50240" wikidata="Q617" url="?curid=50240" title="Padua">
<text>Padua ( ; ; , or ) is a city and &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) in Veneto, northern Italy, and the capital of the province of Padua. The city lies on the banks of the river Bacchiglione, west of Venice and southeast of Vicenza, and has a population of 214,000 (). It is also the economic and communications hub of the area. Padua is sometimes included, with Venice and Treviso, in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area (PATREVE) which has a population of around 2,600,000.

Besides the Bacchiglione, the Brenta River, which once ran through the city, still touches the northern districts. Its agricultural setting is the Venetian Plain. To the city&#x27;s south west lies the Euganaean Hills, which feature in poems by Lucan, Martial, Petrarch, Ugo Foscolo, and Percy Bysshe Shelley.

Padua has two UNESCO World Heritage List entries: its Botanical Garden, which is the world&#x27;s oldest, and its 14th-century frescoes, situated in buildings in the city centre. An example is the Scrovegni Chapel painted by Giotto at the beginning of 1300.

Padua is home to one of the oldest universities in the world, the University of Padua, founded in 1222 and where figures such as Galileo Galilei and Nicolaus Copernicus taught or studied. In 1610, Galileo observed the moons of Jupiter through a homemade telescope in Padua, marking the second phase of the Copernican Revolution. Today, the university has around 72,000 students and has a profound impact on the city&#x27;s recreational, artistic and economic activities.

==Etymology==
The original significance of the Roman name &quot;Patavium&quot; () is uncertain. It may be connected with &quot;Padus&quot;, the ancient name of the Po River. In addition, the Indo-European root &quot;pat-&quot; may refer to a wide open plain as opposed to nearby hills. (In Latin this root is present in the word &quot;patera&quot; &#x27;plate&#x27; and the verb &quot;patere&quot; &#x27;to open&#x27;.) The suffix &quot;-av&quot; (also found in names of rivers such as &quot;Timavus&quot; and &quot;Tiliaventum&quot;) is likely of Venetic origin, precisely indicating the presence of a river, which in the case of Padua is the Brenta. The ending &quot;-ium&quot; signifies the presence of villages that have united themselves together. According to another theory, &quot;Patavium&quot; probably derives from Gaulish &quot;padi&quot; &#x27;pine&#x27;, in reference to the pine forests thereabouts.

==History==
=== Antiquity ===

Padua claims to be among the oldest cities in northern Italy. According to a tradition dated at least to the time of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; and to Livy&#x27;s &quot;Ab Urbe Condita&quot;, Padua was founded around 1183 BC by the Trojan prince Antenor.

After the Fall of Troy, Antenor led a group of Trojans and their Paphlagonian allies, the Eneti or Veneti, who lost their king Pylaemenes to settle the Euganean plain in Italy. Thus, when a large ancient stone sarcophagus was exhumed in the year 1274, officials of the medieval commune declared the remains within to be those of Antenor. An inscription by the native humanist scholar Lovato Lovati placed near the tomb reads:

However, more recent tests suggest the sepulcher dates back to between the 4th and 3rd centuries BC. Nevertheless, archeological remains confirm an early date for the foundation of the center of the town to between the 11th and 10th centuries B.C. By the 5th century BC, Padua, rose on the banks of the river Brenta, which in the Roman era was called &quot;Medoacus Maior&quot; and probably until AD 589 followed the path of the present-day Bacchiglione (&quot;Retrone&quot;). Padua was one of the principal centers of the Veneti.

The Roman historian Livy records an attempted invasion by the Spartan king Cleonimos around 302 BC. The Spartans came up the river but were defeated by the Veneti in a naval battle and gave up the idea of conquest. Still, later, the Veneti of Padua successfully repulsed invasions by the Etruscans and Gauls. According to Livy and Silius Italicus, the Veneti, including those of Padua, formed an alliance with the Romans by 226 BC against their common enemies, first the Gauls and then the Carthaginians. Men from Padua fought and died beside the Romans at Cannae.

With Rome&#x27;s northwards expansion, Padua was gradually assimilated into the Roman Republic. In 175 BC, Padua requested the aid of Rome in putting down a local civil war. In 91 BC, Padua, along with other cities of the Veneti, fought with Rome against the rebels in the Social War. Around 49 (or 45 or 43) BC, Padua was made a Roman &quot;municipium&quot; under the &quot;Lex Julia Municipalis&quot; and its citizens ascribed to the Roman tribe, &quot;Fabia&quot;. At that time the population of the city was perhaps 40,000. The city was reputed for its excellent breed of horses and the wool of its sheep. In fact, the poet Martial remarks on the thickness of the tunics made there. By the end of the first century BC, Padua seems to have been the wealthiest city in Italy outside of Rome. The city became so powerful that it was reportedly able to raise two hundred thousand fighting men. However, despite its wealth, the city was also renowned for its simple manners and strict morality. This concern with morality is reflected in Livy&#x27;s &quot;Roman History&quot; (XLIII.13.2) wherein he portrays Rome&#x27;s rise to dominance as being founded upon her moral rectitude and discipline. Still later, Pliny, referring to one of his Paduan protégés&#x27; Paduan grandmother, Sarrana Procula, lauds her as more upright and disciplined than any of her strict fellow citizens (Epist. i.xiv.6). Padua also provided the Empire with notable intellectuals. Nearby Abano was the birthplace, and after many years spent in Rome, the death place of Livy, whose Latin was said by the critic Asinius Pollio to betray his &quot;Patavinitas&quot; (q.v. Quintilian, &quot;Inst. Or.&quot; viii.i.3).

Padua was also the birthplace of Thrasea Paetus, Asconius Pedianus, and perhaps Valerius Flaccus.

Christianity was introduced in Padua and in most of the Veneto region by Saint Prosdocimus. He is venerated as the first bishop of the city. His deacon, the Jewish convert Daniel, is also a saintly patron of the city.
===Late Antiquity===
The history of Padua during Late Antiquity follows the course of events common to most cities of north-eastern Italy. Padua suffered from the invasion of the Huns and was savagely sacked by Attila in 450. A number of years afterward, it fell under the control of the Gothic kings Odoacer and Theodoric the Great. It was reconquered for a short time by the Byzantine Empire in 540 during the Gothic War. However, depopulation from plague and war ensued. The city was again seized by the Goths under Totila, but was restored to the Eastern Empire by Narses only to fall under the control of the Lombards in 568. During these years, many Paduans sought safety in the countryside and especially in the nearby lagoons of what would become Venice. In 601, the city rose in revolt against Agilulf, the Lombard king who put the city under siege. After enduring a 12-year-long bloody siege, the Lombards stormed and burned the city. Many ancient artifacts and buildings were seriously damaged. The remains of an amphitheater (the &quot;Arena&quot;) and some bridge foundations are all that remain of Roman Padua today. The townspeople fled to the hills and later returned to eke out a living among the ruins; the ruling class abandoned the city for the Venetian Lagoon, according to a chronicle. The city did not easily recover from this blow, and Padua was still weak when the Franks succeeded the Lombards as masters of northern Italy.

===Frankish and Episcopal Supremacy===
At the Diet of Aix-la-Chapelle (828), the duchy and march of Friuli, in which Padua lay, was divided into four counties, one of which took its title from the city of Padua.

The end of the early Middle Ages in Padua was marked by the sack of the city by the Magyars in 899. It was many years after Padua recovered from this ravage.

During the period of episcopal supremacy over the cities of northern Italy, Padua does not appear to have been either very important or very active. The general tendency of its policy throughout the war of investitures was Imperial (Ghibelline) and not Roman (Guelph); and its bishops were, for the most part, of Germanic extraction.

===Emergence of the Commune===
Under the surface, several important movements were taking place that were to prove formative for the later development of Padua.

At the beginning of the 11th century, the citizens established a constitution, composed of a general council or legislative assembly and a &quot;credenza&quot; or executive body.

During the next century, they were engaged in wars with Venice and Vicenza for the right of water-way on the Bacchiglione and the Brenta. The city grew in power and self-confidence and in 1138, the government was entrusted to two consuls.

The great families of Camposampiero, Este and Da Romano began to emerge and to divide the Paduan district among themselves. The citizens, in order to protect their liberties, were obliged to elect a podestà in 1178. Their choice first fell on one of the Este family.

A fire devastated Padua in 1174. This required the virtual rebuilding of the city.

The temporary success of the Lombard League helped to strengthen the towns. However, their civic jealousy soon reduced them to weakness again. In 1214–1216, Padua was involved in a conflict with Venice, which it lost. In 1236 Frederick II found little difficulty in establishing his vicar Ezzelino III da Romano in Padua and the neighbouring cities, where he practised frightful cruelties on the inhabitants. Ezzelino was unseated in June 1256 without civilian bloodshed, thanks to Pope Alexander IV.

Padua then enjoyed a period of calm and prosperity: the basilica of the saint was begun; and the Paduans became masters of Vicenza. The University of Padua (the second university in Italy, after Bologna) was founded in 1222, and as it flourished in the 13th century, Padua outpaced Bologna, where no effort had been made to expand the revival of classical precedents beyond the field of jurisprudence, to become a center of early humanist researches, with first-hand knowledge of Roman poets that was unrivalled in Italy or beyond the Alps.

However, the advances of Padua in the 13th century finally brought the commune into conflict with Can Grande della Scala, lord of Verona. In 1311 Padua had to yield to the Scaligeri of Verona.

===Emergence of the Signoria===
Jacopo da Carrara was elected lord (&quot;signore&quot;) of Padua in 1318, at that point the city was home to 40,000 people. From then till 1405, nine members of the Carraresi family, including Ubertino, Jacopo II, and Francesco il Vecchio, succeeded one another as lords of the city, with the exception of a brief period of Scaligeri overlordship between 1328 and 1337 and two years (1388–1390) when Giangaleazzo Visconti held the town. The period of the &quot;signoria&quot; is covered down to 1358 in the chronicle of Guglielmo Cortusi.

The Carraresi period was a long period of restlessness, for the Carraresi were constantly at war. Under Carraresi rule the early humanist circles in the university were effectively disbanded: Albertino Mussato, the first modern poet laureate, died in exile at Chioggia in 1329, and the eventual heir of the Paduan tradition was the Tuscan Petrarch.

In 1387 John Hawkwood won the Battle of Castagnaro for Padua, against Giovanni Ordelaffi, for Verona. The Carraresi period finally came to an end as the power of the Visconti and of Venice grew in importance.

===Venetian rule===
Padua came under the rule of the Republic of Venice in 1405, and mostly remained that way until the fall of the republic in 1797.

There was just a brief period when the city changed hands (in 1509) during the wars of the League of Cambrai. On 10 December 1508, representatives of the Papacy, France, the Holy Roman Empire, and Ferdinand V of Castile concluded the League of Cambrai against the Republic. The agreement provided for the complete dismemberment of Venice&#x27;s territory in Italy and for its partition among the signatories: Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I of the House of Habsburg was to receive Padua in addition to Verona and other territories. In 1509 Padua was held for just a few weeks by Imperial supporters. Venetian troops quickly recovered it and successfully defended Padua during its siege by Imperial troops.

The city was governed by two Venetian nobles, a podestà for civil affairs and a captain for military affairs. Both of them were elected for sixteen months. Under these governors, the great and small councils continued to discharge municipal business and to administer the Paduan law, contained in the statutes of 1276 and 1362. The treasury was managed by two chamberlains; and every five years the Paduans sent one of their nobles to reside as nuncio in Venice, and to watch the interests of his native town.

Venice fortified Padua with new walls, built between 1507 and 1544, with a series of monumental gates.

===Austrian rule===
In 1797 the Venetian Republic came to an end with the Treaty of Campo Formio, and Padua, like much of the Veneto region, was ceded to the Habsburgs. In 1806 the city passed to the French puppet Kingdom of Italy until the fall of Napoleon, in 1814, when the city became part of the newly formed Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, part of the Austrian Empire.

Austrian rule was unpopular with progressive circles in northern Italy, but the feelings of the population (from the lower to the upper classes) towards the empire were mixed. In Padua, the year of revolutions of 1848 saw a student revolt which on 8 February turned the University and the Caffè Pedrocchi into battlegrounds in which students and ordinary Paduans fought side by side. The revolt was however short-lived, and there were no other episodes of unrest under the Austrian Empire (nor previously had there been any), as in Venice or in other parts of Italy; while opponents of Austria were forced into exile.

Under Austrian rule, Padua began its industrial development; one of the first Italian rail tracks, Padua-Venice, was built in 1845.

In 1866 the Battle of Königgrätz gave Italy the opportunity, as an ally of Prussia, to take Veneto, and Padua was also annexed to the recently formed Kingdom of Italy.

===Italian rule===
Annexed to Italy during 1866, Padua was at the centre of the poorest area of Northern Italy, as Veneto was until the 1960s. Despite this, the city flourished in the following decades both economically and socially, developing its industry, being an important agricultural market and having a very important cultural and technological centre like the University. The city hosted also a major military command and many regiments.

===The 20th century===
When Italy entered World War I on 24 May 1915, Padua was chosen as the main command of the Italian Army. The king, Vittorio Emanuele III, and the commander in chief, Cadorna, went to live in Padua for the period of the war. After the defeat of Italy in the battle of Caporetto in autumn 1917, the front line was situated on the river Piave. This was just from Padua, and the city was now in range of the Austrian artillery. However, the Italian military command did not withdraw. The city was bombed several times (about 100 civilian deaths). A memorable feat was Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s flight to Vienna from the nearby San Pelagio Castle air field.

A year later, the threat to Padua was removed. In late October 1918, the Italian Army won the decisive Battle of Vittorio Veneto, and the Austrian forces collapsed. The armistice was signed at Villa Giusti, Padua, on 3 November 1918.

During the war, the industry grew rapidly, and this provided Padua with a base for further post-war development. In the years immediately following World War I, Padua developed outside the historical town, enlarging and growing in population, even if labor and social strife were rampant at the time.

As in many other areas in Italy, Padua experienced great social turmoil in the years immediately following World War I. The city was shaken by strikes and clashes, factories and fields were subject to occupation, and war veterans struggled to re-enter civilian life. Many supported a new political way, fascism. As in other parts of Italy, the National Fascist Party in Padua soon came to be seen as the defender of property and order against revolution. The city was also the site of one of the largest fascist mass rallies, with some 300,000 people reportedly attending one speech by Benito Mussolini.

New buildings, in typical fascist architecture, sprang up in the city. Examples can be found today in the buildings surrounding Piazza Spalato (today Piazza Insurrezione), the railway station, the new part of City Hall, and part of the Bo Palace hosting the University.

Following Italy&#x27;s defeat in the Second World War on 8 September 1943, Padua became part of the Italian Social Republic, a puppet state of the Nazi occupiers. The city hosted the Ministry of Public Instruction of the new state, as well as military and militia commands and a military airport. The Resistenza, the Italian partisans, was very active against both the new fascist rule and the Nazis. One of the main leaders of the Resistenza in the area was the University vice-chancellor, Concetto Marchesi.

From December 1943 to the end of the war, Padua was bombed 24 times by Allied aircraft; the heaviest raids were the ones on 16 and 30 December 1943 (each of which caused 300 victims), 7 February 1944 (300 victims), 11 March 1944 (over 300 tons of bombs dropped by 111 bombers), 22 and 23 March 1944, 20 April 1944 (180 victims), 22 February and 12 March 1945. The worst-hit areas were the railway station (the target of most raids) and the northern district of Arcella, where 96% of all buildings were destroyed; overall, 950 homes were destroyed and 1,400 damaged. During one of these bombings, the Church of the Eremitani, with frescoes by Andrea Mantegna, was destroyed, considered by some art historians to be Italy&#x27;s biggest wartime cultural loss. The Cathedral and the University also suffered damage. Some 2,000 inhabitants of Padua were killed by the raids.

On 26 April 1945, the partisans started the final insurrection against the Germans and Fascists; in the subsequent fighting, 224 partisans and 497 Germans were killed. 5,000 German troops, including three generals, surrendered to the partisans in Padua, and another 10,000 in the surrounding area; on 28 April New Zealand troops (2nd New Zealand Division) of the British Eighth Army entered the city. A small Commonwealth War Cemetery is located in the west part of the city, commemorating the sacrifice of these troops.

After the war, the city developed rapidly, reflecting Veneto&#x27;s rise from being the poorest region in northern Italy to one of the richest and most economically active regions of modern Italy.

==Geography==

===Climate===
Padua experiences a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) characteristic of northern Italy, modified by the nearby Adriatic Sea. 

==Main sights==
* The Scrovegni Chapel (Italian: &quot;Cappella degli Scrovegni&quot;) is Padua&#x27;s most notable sight. It houses a cycle of frescoes completed in 1305 by Giotto. It was commissioned by Enrico degli Scrovegni, a wealthy banker, as a private chapel once attached to his family&#x27;s palazzo. It is also called the &quot;Arena Chapel&quot; because it stands on the site of a Roman-era arena. The fresco cycle details the life of the Virgin Mary and has been acknowledged by many to be one of the most important fresco cycles in the world for its role in the development of European painting. It also includes one of the earliest representations of a kiss in the history of art (Meeting at the Golden Gate, 1305). Entrance to the chapel is an elaborate ordeal, as it involves spending 15 minutes prior to entrance in a climate-controlled, airlocked vault, used to stabilize the temperature between the outside world and the inside of the chapel. This is intended to protect the frescoes from moisture and mold.
* The Palazzo della Ragione, with its great hall on the upper floor, is reputed to have the largest roof unsupported by columns in Europe; the hall is nearly rectangular, its length , its breadth , and its height ; the walls are covered with allegorical frescoes; the building stands upon arches, and the upper storey is surrounded by an open loggia, not unlike that which surrounds the basilica of Vicenza. The Palazzo was begun in 1172 and finished in 1219. In 1306, Fra Giovanni, an Augustinian friar, covered the whole with one roof. Originally there were three roofs, spanning the three chambers into which the hall was at first divided; the internal partition walls remained till the fire of 1420, when the Venetian architects who undertook the restoration removed them, throwing all three spaces into one and forming the present great hall, the &quot;Salone&quot;. The new space was refrescoed by Nicolo&#x27; Miretto and Stefano da Ferrara, working from 1425 to 1440. Beneath the great hall, there is a centuries-old market.
* In the Piazza dei Signori is the loggia called the &quot;Gran Guardia&quot;, (1493–1526), and close by is the &quot;Palazzo del Capitanio&quot;, the residence of the Venetian governors, with its great door, the work of Giovanni Maria Falconetto, the Veronese architect-sculptor who introduced Renaissance architecture to Padua and who completed the door in 1532. Falconetto was the architect of Alvise Cornaro&#x27;s garden loggia, (&quot;Loggia Cornaro&quot;), the first fully Renaissance building in Padua. Nearby stands the Cathedral, remodelled in 1552 after a design of Michelangelo. It contains works by Nicolò Semitecolo, Francesco Bassano and Giorgio Schiavone. The nearby Baptistry, consecrated in 1281, houses the most important frescoes cycle by Giusto de&#x27; Menabuoi.
* The Teatro Verdi is host to performances of operas, musicals, plays, ballets, and concerts.
* The most celebrated of the Paduan churches is the &quot;Basilica di Sant&#x27;Antonio da Padova&quot;, locally known as &quot;Il Santo&quot;. The bones of the saint rest in a chapel richly ornamented with carved marble, the work of various artists, among them Sansovino and Falconetto. The basilica was begun around the year 1230 and completed in the following century. Tradition says that the building was designed by Nicola Pisano. It is covered by seven cupolas, two of them pyramidal. There are also four cloisters. The belltower has eight bells in C.
* Donatello&#x27;s equestrian statue of the Venetian general Gattamelata (Erasmo da Narni) can be found on the piazza in front of the &quot;Basilica di Sant&#x27;Antonio da Padova&quot;. It was cast in 1453, and was the first full-size equestrian bronze cast since antiquity. It was inspired by the Marcus Aurelius equestrian sculpture at the Capitoline Hill in Rome.
* Not far from the Gattamelata statue are the St. George Oratory (13th century), with frescoes by Altichiero, and the &quot;Scuola di S. Antonio&quot; (16th century), with frescoes by Tiziano (Titian).
* One of the best known symbols of Padua is the &quot;Prato della Valle&quot;, a elliptical square. This is one of the biggest in Europe. In the centre is a wide garden surrounded by an oval canal, lined by 78 statues portraying illustrious citizens. It was created by Andrea Memmo in the late 18th century. Memmo once resided in the monumental 15th-century &quot;Palazzo Angeli&quot;, which now houses the Museum of Precinema.
* Abbey of Santa Giustina and adjacent Basilica. In the 15th century, it became one of the most important monasteries in the area, until it was suppressed by Napoleon in 1810. In 1919 it was reopened. The tombs of several saints are housed in the interior, including those of Justine, St. Prosdocimus, St. Maximus, St. Urius, St. Felicita, St. Julianus, as well as relics of the Apostle St. Matthias and the Evangelist St. Luke. This is home to some art, including the &quot;Martyrdom of St. Justine&quot; by Paolo Veronese. The complex was founded in the 5th century on the tomb of the namesake saint, Justine of Padua. The belltower has eight bells in B.
* The Church of the Eremitani is an Augustinian church of the 13th century, containing the tombs of Jacopo (1324) and Ubertinello (1345) da Carrara, lords of Padua, and the chapel of SS James and Christopher, formerly illustrated by Mantegna&#x27;s frescoes. This was largely destroyed by the Allies in World War II, because it was next to the Nazi headquarters. The old monastery of the church now houses the Musei Civici di Padova (town archeologic and art museum).
* Santa Sofia Church is probably Padova&#x27;s most ancient church. The crypt was begun in the late 10th century by Venetian craftsmen. It has a basilica plan with Romanesque-Gothic interior and Byzantine elements. The apse was built in the 12th century. The edifice appears to be tilting slightly due to the soft terrain.

* The church of &quot;San Gaetano&quot; (1574–1586) was designed by Vincenzo Scamozzi, on an unusual octagonal plan. The interior, decorated with polychrome marbles, houses a &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; by Andrea Briosco, in Nanto stone.
* The 16th-century, Baroque Padua Synagogue
* At the centre of the historical city, the buildings of Palazzo del Bò, the centre of the University of Padua
* The City Hall, called Palazzo Moroni, the wall of which is covered by the names of the Paduan dead in the different wars of Italy and which is attached to the Palazzo della Ragione;
* The Caffé Pedrocchi, built in 1831 by architect Giuseppe Jappelli in neoclassical style with Egyptian influence. This café has been open for almost two centuries. It hosts the Risorgimento museum, and the near building of the &quot;Pedrocchino&quot; (&quot;little Pedrocchi&quot;) in neogothic style.
* The city centre is surrounded by the city walls, built during the early 16th century, by architects that include Michele Sanmicheli. There are only a few ruins left, together with two gates, of the smaller and inner 13th-century walls. There is also a castle, the Castello. Its main tower was transformed between 1767 and 1777 into an astronomical observatory known as &quot;Specola&quot;. However the other buildings were used as prisons during the 19th and 20th centuries. They are now being restored.
* The Ponte San Lorenzo, a Roman bridge largely underground, along with the ancient Ponte Molino, Ponte Altinate, Ponte Corvo and Ponte S. Matteo.

===Villas===
In the community of Padua are numerous noble villas. These include:
* &quot;Villa Molin&quot;, in the Mandria fraction, designed by Vincenzo Scamozzi in 1597.
* &quot;Villa Mandriola&quot;, (17th century), at Albignasego
* &quot;Villa Pacchierotti-Trieste &quot;(17th century), at Limena
* &quot;Villa Cittadella-Vigodarzere&quot; (19th century), at Saonara
* &quot;Villa Selvatico da Porto &quot;(15th–18th century), at Vigonza
* &quot;Villa Loredan&quot;, at Sant&#x27;Urbano
* &quot;Villa Contarini&quot;, at Piazzola sul Brenta, built in 1546 by Palladio and enlarged in the following centuries, is the most important.

===Churches===
Padua&#x27;s historic core, includes numerous churches of significant architecture and arts. These include:
* Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua. Built 1235.
* Santa Caterina d&#x27;Alessandria. Present by the 13th century.
* San Clemente. Built 1190.

==Culture==
Padua has long been acclaimed for its university, founded in 1222. Under the rule of Venice the university was governed by a board of three patricians, called the &quot;Riformatori dello Studio di Padova&quot;. The list of notable professors and alumni is long, containing, among others, the names of Bembo, Sperone Speroni, the anatomist Vesalius, Copernicus, Fallopius, Fabrizio d&#x27;Acquapendente, Galileo Galilei, William Harvey, Pietro Pomponazzi, Reginald, later Cardinal Pole, Scaliger, Tasso and Jan Zamoyski. It is also where, in 1678, Elena Lucrezia Cornaro Piscopia became the first woman in the world to graduate from university. The university hosts the oldest anatomy theatre, built in 1594.

The university also hosts the oldest botanical garden (1545) in the world. The botanical garden Orto Botanico di Padova was founded as the garden of curative herbs attached to the University&#x27;s faculty of medicine. The Senate of the Venetian republic decided that knowledge of herbal remedies would reduces errors made by pharmacists, so the garden was built. Over time, the Venetian republic funded field trips that gathered plants from all over the world, making it an important place for the introduction of many exotic plants. It still contains an important collection of rare plants.

The place of Padua in the history of art is nearly as important as its place in the history of learning. The presence of the university attracted many distinguished artists, such as Giotto, Fra Filippo Lippi and Donatello; and for native art there was the school of Francesco Squarcione, whence issued Mantegna.

Francesco Petrarca (commonly anglicized as Petrarch, 20 July 1304 – 19 July 1374), a scholar, poet of the Italian Renaissance, and one of the earliest humanists, was Canonico at the Padua Cathedral (Duomo), invited by Francesco I da Carrara, lord of Padua. Petrarca lived in the canonical house via Dietro Duomo 26/28 in 1349 which remained his property until 1374. His house in Padua was a stopover for numerous historical figures, such as the Carrara princes and Giovanni Boccaccio.

Padua is also the birthplace of the celebrated architect Andrea Palladio, whose 16th-century villas in the area of Padua, Venice, Vicenza and Treviso are among the most notable of Italy and they were often copied during the 18th and 19th centuries; and of Giovanni Battista Belzoni, adventurer, engineer and egyptologist.

The sculptor Antonio Canova produced his first work in Padua, one of which is among the statues of Prato della Valle (presently a copy is displayed in the open air, while the original is in the Musei Civici). In Prato della Valle, there is the statue of Antonio Canova (by Giovanni Ferrari), which depicts the sculptor in the act of sculpting the bust of the prosecutor Antonio Cappello.

The Antonianum is settled among Prato della Valle, the Basilica of Saint Anthony and the Botanic Garden. It was built in 1897 by the Jesuit fathers and kept alive until 2002. During World War II, under the leadership of P. Messori Roncaglia SJ, it became the center of the resistance movement against the Nazis. Indeed, it briefly survived P. Messori&#x27;s death and was sold by the Jesuits in 2004.

Padua also plays host to the majority of &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot; by William Shakespeare and in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; Benedick is named as &quot;Signior Benedick of Padua&quot;.

Paolo De Poli, painter and enamellist, author of decorative panels and design objects, 15 times invited to the Venice Biennale was born in Padua. The electronic musician Tying Tiffany was also born in Padua.

==Demographics==
In 2007, there were 210,301 people residing in Padua, located in the province of Padua, Veneto, of whom 47.1% were male and 52.9% were female. Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 14.87% of the population compared to pensioners who number 23.72%. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06% (minors) and 19.94% (pensioners). The average age of Padua residents is 45 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Padua grew by 2.21%, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.85%. The current birth rate of Padua is 8.49 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.

, 90.66% of the population was Italian. The largest immigrant group comes from other European nations (the largest being Romanians, Moldovans, and Albanians): 5.14%, sub-saharan Africa 1.08%, and East Asia: 1.04%. The city is predominantly Roman Catholic, but due to immigration now has some Orthodox Christian, Muslim and Hindu followers.

==Government==
Since local government political reorganization in 1993, Padua has been governed by the City Council of Padua. Voters elect directly 33 councilors and the mayor of Padua every five years. The current mayor of Padua is Sergio Giordani (independent, supported by the PD), elected on 26 June 2017.

This is a list of the mayors of Padua since 1946:


== Consulates ==
Padua hosts consulates for several nations, including those of Canada, Croatia, Ivory Coast, Peru, Poland, Switzerland and Uruguay. A consulate for South Korea was planned in 2014 and a consulate for Moldova was opened on 1 August 2014.

==Economy==
The industrial area of Padova was created in the eastern part of the city in 1946; it is now one of the biggest industrial zones in Europe, having an area of 11 million sqm. The main offices of 1,300 industries are based here, employing 50,000 people.

==Transport==

=== By car ===
By car, there are 2 motorways (autostrade in Italian): A4 Brescia-Padova, connecting it to Verona (then to Brenner Pass, Innsbruck and Bavaria) and Milan (then Switzerland, Turin and France); A4 Padova-Venezia, to Venice then Belluno (for Dolomites holiday resorts like Cortina) Trieste and Tarvisio (for Austria, Slovenia, Croatia and Eastern Europe); A13 Bologna-Padova, to Ferrara and Bologna (then Central and South Italy). Roads connect Padua with all the large and small centers of the region. A motorway with more than 20 exits surrounds the city, connecting districts and the small towns of the surrounding region.

===By rail===
Padua has two railway stations open to passengers. The main station &quot;Stazione di Padova&quot; has 11 platforms and is sometimes incorrectly referred to as &quot;Padova Centrale&quot;; it is one of the biggest stations in Italy. More than 450 trains per day leave Padova. The station is used by over 20 million passengers per year. Other railway stations are &quot;Padova Ponte di Brenta&quot; (soon to be closed), Padova San Lazzaro (planned), Padova Campo di Marte, with no passenger service once used as a freight station which could become one of the stations of the &quot;Servizio Ferroviario Metropolitano Regionale&quot;. From Padova, high speed trains connect to Milan, Rome, Bologna, Florence and Venice; one can reach Milan in 1hour and 59 minutes, Rome in 3hours 13minutes and Venice in 30 minutes. There are also international day trains to Zurich and Munich, and overnight sleeper services to Munich and Vienna (ÖBB).

The station was opened in 1842 when the service started on the first part of the Milan–Venice railway (the &quot;Imperial Regia Ferrovia Ferdinandea&quot;) built from Padua to Marghera through Mestre. Porta Marghera is a major port of the Venetian area.

Railways enthusiasts can visit the Signal Box A (Cabina A), preserved by the &quot;Società Veneta Ferrovie&quot; (a society named after the former public works and railway company, based in &quot;Piazza Eremitani&quot; in Padua) association.

===By aeroplane===
Padua is approximately away from Venice Marco Polo Airport which is the nearest airport with regular commercial service. Padua is also serviced by the Verona Villafranca Airport, Treviso Airport and Bologna Guglielmo Marconi Airport.

The Gino Allegri, or &quot;Aeroporto civile di Padova &quot;Gino Allegri&quot;&quot;, is no longer served by regularly scheduled flights. Padua is, however, the home of one of Italy&#x27;s four area control centres.

===Public transport===
Urban public transport includes public buses together with a new Translohr guided tramway (connecting Albignasego, in the south of Padua, with Pontevigodarzere in the north of the city, thanks to the new line built in 2009) and private taxis.

The city centre is partly closed to vehicles, except for residents and permitted vehicles. There are some car parks surrounding the district. In this area, as well, there are some streets and squares restricted to pedestrian and bicycle use only.

Padua has approximately 40 bus lines, which are served by new buses (purchased in 2008–9).

The Veneto Region is building a regional rail line (S-Bahn-like system) around the city with 15 new stations. Its name will be &quot;SFMR&quot; and it will reach the province of Venice.

===Statistics===

The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 13 min, while 30% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day.

==Sports==
Padua is the home of Calcio Padova, an association football team that currently plays in Italy&#x27;s Serie C, and who played 16 Serie A championships (last 2 in 1995 and 1996, but the previous 14 between 1929 and 1962); the Petrarca Padova rugby union team, winner of 14 national championships (all between 1970 and 2022) and 2 national cups, and now plays in the Top12 league; and the Pallavolo Padova volleyball club, once called Petrarca Padova as well, which plays in the Italian first division (Superlega) and who won a CEV cup in 1994. Basketball, cycling (Padua has been for several years home of the famous Giro del Veneto), rowing (two teams among the best ones in Italy, Canottieri Padova and Padova Canottaggio), horseback-riding, and swimming are popular sports too.

The main venues are the following: Stadio Euganeo for football, rugby (it occasionally hosts the national team during the Autumn internationals) and athletics, about 32,000 seats; Stadio Plebiscito for rugby union, about 9,000 seats; Palazzetto dello Sport San Lazzaro for volleyball and basketball, about 5,000 seats; Ippodromo Breda – Le Padovanelle for horse races. The old Stadio Appiani, which hosted up to 21,000 people, presently reduced to 10,000 for security reasons twenty years ago, and near to Prato della Valle in the city central area, was recently restored and hosts some Calcio Padova training sessions, as well as youth games. There is also a small ice stadium for skating and hockey, with about 1,000 seats.

Italy international rugby players Mauro and Mirco Bergamasco, Marco Bortolami, Andrea Marcato and Leonardo Ghiraldini were all born in Padua. All of them started their careers in Petrarca Padova.

Well known footballers from Padua are Francesco Toldo, who was born here, and Alessandro Del Piero, who started his professional career in the Calcio Padova.

<text>Led Zeppelin III is the third studio album by the English rock band Led Zeppelin, released on 5 October 1970. It was recorded in three locations. Much of the work was done at Headley Grange, a country house, using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Additional sessions were held at Island Studios and Olympic Studios in London. As with the prior album, the band eschewed the use of guest musicians, with all music performed by band members Robert Plant (vocals), Jimmy Page (guitars), John Paul Jones (bass, keyboards), and John Bonham (drums). The range of instruments played by the band was greatly enhanced on this album, with Jones especially emerging as a talented multi-instrumentalist, playing a wide range of keyboard and stringed instruments, including various synthesizers, mandolin and double bass, in addition to his usual bass guitar. As with prior albums, Page served as producer on the album, with mixing done by Andy Johns and Terry Manning.

The album showed a progression from straightforward rock towards folk and acoustic music. While hard rock influences were still present, such as on &quot;Immigrant Song&quot;, acoustic-based songs such as &quot;Gallows Pole&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s the Way&quot; showed Led Zeppelin were capable of playing different styles successfully. The band wrote most of the material themselves, but as with prior records, included two songs that were re-interpretations of earlier works: &quot;Gallows Pole&quot;, based on a traditional English folk song, by way of American singer Fred Gerlach; and &quot;Hats Off to (Roy) Harper&quot;, a reworking of a blues song by Bukka White. The acoustic material developed from a songwriting session between Plant and Page at Bron-Yr-Aur cottage in Wales, which influenced the musical direction.

The album was one of the most anticipated of 1970, and its shipping date was held up by the intricate inner sleeve design based around a volvelle, with numerous images visible through holes in the outer cover. It was an immediate commercial success upon release and topped the UK and US charts. Although many critics were initially confused over the change in musical style and gave the album a mixed response, &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot; has since been acknowledged as representing an important milestone in the band&#x27;s history and a turning point in their music.

==Background==
By 1970, Led Zeppelin had achieved commercial success in both the UK and the US with their first two albums. They were determined to have a proper break, having recorded most of &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot; in various locations while on tour, financing the sessions with the album sales and tour receipts. Following an exhausting concert tour of North America that spring, lead singer Robert Plant recommended to guitarist and producer Jimmy Page that they should retreat to Bron-Yr-Aur, an 18th-century cottage in Snowdonia, Wales, on a hilltop overlooking the Dyfi Valley, north of the market town Machynlleth. Plant had spent holidays there with his family.

This remote setting had no running water or electric power, which encouraged a slight change of musical direction for the band towards an emphasis on acoustic arrangements. Page later explained that the tranquillity of Bron-Yr-Aur stood in sharp contrast to the continual touring of 1969, affecting the overall tone of the songwriting and dominance of acoustic guitars. His playing was influenced by folk guitarists Davey Graham and Bert Jansch, who regularly used alternative guitar tunings. Plant also recalled the band were &quot;obsessed with change&quot; and enjoyed listening to John Fahey. The band specifically wanted a change in direction, to show they could play any style of music they wanted.

==Recording==
The first recording sessions for &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot; took place at Olympic Studios in November 1969. A press statement from manager Peter Grant said the group were recording a non-album track to be released as a single, but this was ultimately abandoned. Further sessions took place towards the end of the year, in between touring, before the decision was made to stop working and take a break at Bron-Yr-Aur. After preparing material for the album there, Page and Plant were joined by drummer John Bonham and bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones at Headley Grange, a mansion in East Hampshire, to rehearse the songs. The rural atmosphere gave a relaxed feel to the sessions, and the band found it to be a more enjoyable environment in which to develop songs than a studio in the city.

The album was recorded between May and June 1970 at Headley Grange (using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio) and at Olympic, with further recording at Island Records&#x27; Island Studios in Notting Hill the following month. Mixing took place at Ardent Studios, Memphis, in August 1970, partway through the group&#x27;s sixth American concert tour. The album was produced by Page and engineered by Andy Johns and Terry Manning. Page had first met Manning when the latter&#x27;s band, Lawson and Four More, had supported Page&#x27;s old band the Yardbirds in 1966. Manning had been to several Led Zeppelin shows, and this led to Page asking him to engineer the new album.

==Songs==
&quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot; marked a change in focus for the band, from late 1960s hard rock to a more acoustic-based sound. These styles had been present to a lesser degree on the band&#x27;s first two releases, such as &quot;Babe I&#x27;m Gonna Leave You&quot; and &quot;Ramble On&quot;, from the first and second albums, respectively. However, on this album, the group used more acoustic arrangements, and they would remain prominent to various degrees in the group&#x27;s later releases. With &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot;, the group&#x27;s songwriting dynamic also changed, from Page&#x27;s domination of the first two albums towards a more democratic situation in which all four group members contributed their own compositions and ideas. Plant wrote all of the lyrics, with the exception of &quot;Tangerine&quot;.

===Side one===
&quot;Immigrant Song&quot; was written about the Viking invasions of England and inspired by a short tour of Iceland in June 1970. It was released as a single in the US and became a top 20 hit. It was the opening song for the band&#x27;s appearance at the Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music and at subsequent gigs for the next two years. It was included in the 2003 movie &quot;School of Rock&quot;, after Jack Black made a short video with fans asking for permission for its use. Page clarified that the song&#x27;s opening is a combination of a voice and echo feedback.

&quot;Friends&quot; is an acoustic track that uses a C6 tuning on guitar. Page explained: &quot;I played a Harmony acoustic tuned to C–A–C–G–C–E on &#x27;Friends&#x27;... It&#x27;s a C [type] tuning, but not a [typical] C tuning. I made it up.&quot; The song includes a string section arranged by Jones, which Page had wanted to achieve an Indian style of sound. The song was re-recorded as an experimental arrangement with the Bombay Orchestra in March 1972, along with &quot;Four Sticks&quot; from the following untitled album. That arrangement appeared on the 2015 reissue of the retrospective album &quot;Coda&quot;. The song segues into &quot;Celebration Day&quot; via a Moog synthesiser drone.

&quot;Since I&#x27;ve Been Loving You&quot; was one of the first songs to be written for the album, in late 1969. It is a blues song in the key of C minor, featuring Jones on Hammond organ and bass pedals, simultaneously. The song became a live performance staple for the band throughout the rest of their career, replacing &quot;I Can&#x27;t Quit You Baby&quot; from the first album as the band&#x27;s slow blues showcase, with Page&#x27;s guitar solo featured on both the recorded version and in the band&#x27;s live show.

&quot;Out on the Tiles&quot; was mostly written by Bonham, who came up with the idea for the riffs that run through the track. The introduction was used to open live versions of &quot;Black Dog&quot; (from &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot;) and Bonham&#x27;s drum solo on the 1977 US tour.

===Side two===
&quot;Gallows Pole&quot; is an updated arrangement of a traditional folk song called &quot;The Maid Freed from the Gallows&quot;, inspired by a version recorded by Fred Gerlach. Page played a variety of acoustic and electric guitars and banjo, while Jones played mandolin as well as bass. It was reworked by Page and Plant for their 1994 album &quot;No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded&quot;.

&quot;Tangerine&quot; was written by Page in 1968, when the Yardbirds were still together. The track features pedal steel guitar as well as acoustic. It was added to the group&#x27;s live acoustic set in 1971 and performed regularly into the following year. It was then revived as a four-part harmony arrangement in 1975.

&quot;That&#x27;s the Way&quot; had the original title of &quot;The Boy Next Door&quot;. It was written in Bron-Yr-Aur about the problems two people faced in a relationship and the clashes with their families. The song became a staple of the group&#x27;s acoustic set throughout the 1970s and was played at the Bath Festival, where Led Zeppelin performed acoustically for the first time in the UK. Page thought highly of Plant&#x27;s lyrics and considered it a breakthrough in their development as a songwriting team. The pair had gone for a walk and, on their return, sat down by a ravine with a tape recorder, where Page started to play the tune, to which Plant improvised a verse.

&quot;Bron-Y-Aur Stomp&quot; was originally called &quot;Jennings Farm Blues&quot; and recorded as an electric arrangement, at the end of 1969. It was subsequently reworked as an acoustic number and featured Bonham playing spoons.

The closing track, &quot;Hats Off to (Roy) Harper&quot;, was based on the Bukka White blues song &quot;Shake &#x27;Em On Down&quot; and named as a tribute to their friend and folk singer, Roy Harper. The original LP credited the arrangement to &quot;Charles Obscure&quot;, a band in-joke. It features Plant&#x27;s voice fed through a vibrato amplifier.

===Unreleased material===
Page said that the group had 16 tracks to choose from for release on &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot;. Six other songs that were recorded during the &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot; sessions were released at a later date: &quot;Poor Tom&quot; was released on &quot;Coda&quot;; &quot;Bron-Yr-Aur&quot; was included on the 1975 double album &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot;; &quot;Hey, Hey, What Can I Do&quot; was released as the B-side to the 1970 &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; single, and on the 1972 sampler album &quot;The New Age of Atlantic&quot;, later appearing on the first box set in 1990 and then &quot;Coda&quot; (Deluxe Edition) in 2015, along with &quot;St. Tristan&#x27;s Sword&quot;; and both &quot;Jennings Farm Blues&quot; and &quot;Key to the Highway/Trouble in Mind&quot; later appeared on the 2014 deluxe edition of the album.

==Packaging and artwork==
&quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot;&#x27;s original vinyl edition was packaged in a gatefold sleeve with an innovative cover, designed by Zacron, a multi-media artist whom Page had met in 1963 whilst Zacron was a student at Kingston College of Art. Zacron subsequently graduated from the Royal Academy of Arts and became a lecturer at the University of Leeds. Page asked him if he would help design a sleeve for the album, which he helped arrange in January 1970.

The cover and interior gatefold art consisted of a surreal collection of seemingly random images on a white background, many of them connected thematically with flight or aviation. Behind the front cover was a rotatable laminated card disc, or volvelle, covered with more images, including photos of the band members, which showed through holes in the cover; moving an image into place behind one hole would usually bring one or two others into place behind other holes. The back cover was a composite shot of the best photographs from the photography sessions. Zacron chose the images because he wanted to &quot;show them as the giant force they were in music&quot;. In France, this album was released with a different album cover, simply showing a photo of the four band members.

Zacron later said that, upon his completion of the artwork, Page telephoned him while he was in New York to express his satisfaction with the results, saying, &quot;I think it is fantastic&quot;. However, he later thought the artwork was unsatisfactory because of working to a deadline.

==Release and reception==

&quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot; was one of the most anticipated albums of 1970, and advance orders in the US alone were close to the million mark. The volvelle-designed sleeve held up production and caused a two-month delay. In the run-up to release, the group bought a full-page advertisement in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; magazine at the end of September, which simply said, &quot;Thank you for making us the world&#x27;s number one band.&quot; The album was released in the US on 5 October, then in the UK on 23 October. It immediately topped the British charts.

Although the band&#x27;s expanding musical boundaries were greeted warmly by some, detractors attacked the heavier tracks as being mindless noise. In a review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, critic Lester Bangs praised &quot;That&#x27;s the Way&quot; as &quot;beautiful and genuinely moving&quot;, while characterising the band&#x27;s heavier songs as crude and little differentiated from each other. Others criticised the acoustic material for imitating the music of Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, which Page disputed, as the group had featured a similar style on both of their previous albums. Page later said that the negative press given to the third album affected him so much that he did not give press interviews for 18 months after its release, adding that the criticism was one of the reasons why the band&#x27;s untitled follow-up album contained no written information on it at all. Page later came to believe that journalists had little time to listen to the material and were simply looking for &quot;the new &#x27;Whole Lotta Love instead of appreciating the album on its own merits.

A positive review came from Robert Christgau, who originally assigned it an A-minus grade and wrote in his &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;: &quot;I have always approved theoretically of Led Zep&#x27;s concept, and now the group has finally whipped it into shape. It&#x27;s amazing to realize that Robert Plant&#x27;s vocals can convey that same overbearing power when Page plays acoustic, as he does to great effect on several cuts here. No drum solos, either. Heavy.&quot;

&quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot; was a number one hit. In the UK, it reached No. 1 on 7 November 1970 and remained on the chart for 40 weeks. In the US, it entered the chart at No. 3 on 24 October and reached No. 1 the following week. It remained on the chart for 19 weeks and was certified Gold on 8 October 1970. However, following the lukewarm, if not confused and sometimes dismissive reception from critics, sales lagged after this initial peak.

Despite mostly indifferent reviews and lower sales than Led Zeppelin&#x27;s previous two albums, &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot;&#x27;s reputation has increased over time. The RIAA certified the album 2 times platinum in 1990, and 6 times platinum in 1999. The 2014 reissue of the album helped itself get back into the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 10.

==2014 reissue==
Along with the group&#x27;s self-titled debut album and their second album, &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot;, the album was remastered and reissued on 2 June 2014. The reissue comes in six formats: a standard CD edition; a deluxe two-CD edition; a standard LP version; a deluxe two-LP version; a super deluxe two-CD plus two-LP version with a hardback book; and as high-resolution, 24-bit/96k digital downloads. The deluxe and super deluxe editions feature bonus material containing alternative takes, backing tracks and the previously unreleased songs &quot;Bathroom Sound&quot;, &quot;Jennings Farm Blues&quot; and &quot;Key to the Highway/Trouble in Mind&quot;. The LP versions replicate the original volvelle sleeve design. The reissue was released with an inverted colour version of the original album&#x27;s artwork as its bonus disc&#x27;s cover.

The reissue was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 98, based on 10 reviews. The bonus disc was hailed by &quot;Pitchfork&quot; journalist Mark Richardson as &quot;easily the best&quot; of the three reissues. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, David Fricke wrote of highlights in the bonus disc: Jennings Farm Blues&#x27;, an electric run at the folk gallop &#x27;Bron-Y-Aur Stomp&#x27;, shows Zeppelin exploring options, and the medley &#x27;Keys to the Highway/Trouble in Mind&#x27;, by Page and Plant, feels like a deep-blues breath before the next rush forward.&quot;

<text>The untitled fourth studio album by the English rock band Led Zeppelin, commonly known as Led Zeppelin IV, was released on 8 November 1971 by Atlantic Records. Produced by the band&#x27;s guitarist, Jimmy Page, it was recorded between December 1970 and February 1971, mostly in the country house Headley Grange. The album contains one of the band&#x27;s most well-known recordings, the eight-minute-long &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;.

The informal recording environment inspired the band, allowing them to try different arrangements of material and create songs in various styles. After the band&#x27;s previous album &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot; (1970) received lukewarm reviews from critics, they decided their fourth album would officially be untitled and represented instead by four symbols one chosen by each band member without featuring the name or any other details on the cover. Unlike the prior two albums, the band was joined by guest musicians: the singer Sandy Denny on &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot;, and the pianist Ian Stewart on &quot;Rock and Roll&quot;. As with prior albums, most of the material was written by the band, though there was one cover song, a hard rock re-interpretation of the Memphis Minnie blues song &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot;.

The album was a critical and commercial success and is Led Zeppelin&#x27;s best-selling album, having shipped over 37 million copies worldwide. It is one of the best-selling albums in the United States and of all time, while critics have regularly placed it high on lists of the greatest albums of all time.

==Writing and recording==
Following the release of &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot; in October 1970, the group took a break from live performances to concentrate on recording a follow-up. They turned down all touring offers, including a proposed New Year&#x27;s Eve gig that would have been broadcast on television. They returned to Bron-Yr-Aur, a country house in Snowdonia, Wales, to write new material.

Recording sessions for the album began at Island Records&#x27; new studios on Basing Street in London on 5 December 1970, with the recording of &quot;Black Dog&quot;. The group had considered Mick Jagger&#x27;s home, Stargroves as a recording location, but decided it was too expensive. They subsequently moved the following month to Headley Grange, a country house in Hampshire, England, using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio and the engineer Andy Johns, with the Stones&#x27; Ian Stewart assisting. Johns had just worked on engineering &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; and recommended the mobile studio. The guitarist and producer Jimmy Page later recalled: &quot;We needed the sort of facilities where we could have a cup of tea and wander around the garden and go in and do what we had to do.&quot; This relaxed, atmospheric environment at Headley Grange also provided other advantages for the band, as they were able to capture spontaneous performances immediately, with some tracks arising from the communal jamming. The bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones remembered there was no bar or leisure facilities, but this helped focus the group on the music without being distracted.

Once the basic tracks had been recorded, the band added overdubs at Island Studios in February. The band spent five days at Island, before Page then took the multitrack tapes to Sunset Sound in Los Angeles for mixing on 9 February, on Johns&#x27; recommendation, with a plan for an April 1971 release. Mixing would take ten days, before Page travelled back to London with the newly mixed material. The band had a playback at Olympic Studios. The band disliked the results, and so after touring through the spring and early summer, Page remixed the whole album in July. The album was delayed again over the choice of cover and whether it should be a double album, with a possible suggestion it could be issued as a set of EPs.

==Songs==
===Side one===
&quot;Black Dog&quot; was named after a dog that hung around Headley Grange during recording. The riff was written by Page and Jones, while the a cappella section was influenced by Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Oh Well&quot;. The singer Robert Plant wrote the lyrics, and later sang portions of the song during solo concerts. The guitar solos on the outro were recorded directly into the desk, without using an amplifier.

&quot;Rock and Roll&quot; was a collaboration with Stewart that came out of a jam early in the recording sessions at Headley Grange. The drummer John Bonham created the introduction, which came from jamming around the intro to Little Richard&#x27;s &quot;Keep A-Knockin&#x27;&quot;. The track became a live favourite in concert and was performed as the opening number or as an encore. It was released as a promotional single in the US, with stereo and mono mixes on either side of the disc.

&quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; was written by Page on the mandolin, borrowed from Jones. Plant added lyrics inspired by a book he was reading about the Scottish Independence Wars. The track featured a duet between Plant and Fairport Convention&#x27;s Sandy Denny, who provided the only female voice to be heard on a Led Zeppelin recording. Plant played the role of narrator in the song, describing events, while Denny sang the part of the town crier representing the people.
&quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; was mostly written by Page and most of the chord sequence was already worked out when recording started at Basing Street Studios. The lyrics were written by Plant at Headley Grange, about a woman who &quot;took everything without giving anything back&quot;. The final take of the song was recorded at Island Studios after the Headley Grange session. The basic backing track featured Bonham on drums, Jones on electric piano and Page on acoustic guitar. The whole group contributed to the arrangement, such as Jones playing recorders on the introduction and Bonham&#x27;s distinctive drum entry halfway through the piece. Page played the guitar solo using a Fender Telecaster he had received from Jeff Beck. It had been his main guitar on the group&#x27;s first album and early live shows. He put down three different takes of the solo and picked the best to put on the album.

The song was considered the standout track on the album and was played on FM radio stations frequently, but the group resisted all suggestions to release it as a single. It became the centrepiece of the group&#x27;s live set from 1971 onwards. In order to replicate the changes between acoustic, electric and twelve-string guitar on the studio recording, Page played a Gibson EDS-1275 double-neck guitar during the song.

===Side two===
&quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot; was written at Headley Grange and featured Jones playing electric piano. Plant wrote the lyrics about dealing with the clash between students and police over drug possession. The title came from J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Plant later performed the track on solo tours.

&quot;Four Sticks&quot; took its title from Bonham playing the drum pattern that runs throughout the song with four drum sticks, and Jones played analog synth. The track was more difficult to record than the other material on the album, requiring numerous takes. It was played live occasionally in early 1971. The song was also re-recorded with the Bombay Symphony Orchestra in 1972. This version appeared on the deluxe edition reissue of the group&#x27;s 1982 album &quot;Coda&quot;. The song was also reworked for Page and Plant&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded&quot;.

&quot;Going to California&quot; was a quiet acoustic number. It was written by Page and Plant about Californian earthquakes, and trying to find the perfect woman. The music was inspired by Joni Mitchell, of whom both Plant and Page were fans. The track was originally titled &quot;Guide To California&quot;; the final title came from the trip to Los Angeles to mix the album.

&quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot; came from a blues song recorded by Memphis Minnie and Kansas Joe McCoy in 1929. The track opened with Bonham&#x27;s heavy unaccompanied drumming, which was recorded in the lobby of Headley Grange using two Beyerdynamic M 160 microphones suspended above a flight of stairs; output from these were passed to a limiter. A Binson Echorec, a delay effects unit, was also used. Page recalled he had tried to record the track at early sessions but it had sounded flat. The unusual locations around the lobby gave the ideal ambience for the drum sound. This introduction was later extensively sampled in hip hop music during the 1980s. Page and Plant played the song on their 1995 tour promoting &quot;No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded&quot;.

===Other songs===
Three other songs from the sessions, &quot;Down by the Seaside&quot;, &quot;Night Flight&quot; and &quot;Boogie with Stu&quot; (featuring Stewart on piano), were included four years later on the double album &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot;. An early version of &quot;No Quarter&quot; was also recorded at the sessions.

==Title==
After the lukewarm, if not confused and sometimes dismissive, critical reaction &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot; had received in late 1970, Page decided that the next Led Zeppelin album would not have a title, but would instead feature four hand-drawn symbols on the inner sleeve and record label, each one chosen by the band member it represents. The record company were strongly against the idea, but the group stood their ground and refused to hand over the master tapes until their decision had been agreed to.

Page has also stated that the decision to release the album without any written information on the album sleeve was contrary to strong advice given to him by a press agent, who said that after a year&#x27;s absence from both records and touring, the move would be akin to &quot;professional suicide&quot;. Page thought, &quot;We just happened to have a lot of faith in what we were doing.&quot; He recalled the record company were insisting that a title had to be on the album, but held his ground, as he felt it would be an answer to critics who could not review one Led Zeppelin album without a point of reference to earlier ones.

Releasing the album without an official title has made it difficult to consistently identify. While most commonly called &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot;, Atlantic Records catalogues have used the names &quot;Four Symbols&quot; and &quot;The Fourth Album&quot;. It has also been referred to as &quot;ZoSo&quot; (which Page&#x27;s symbol appears to spell), &quot;Untitled&quot; and &quot;Runes&quot;. Page frequently refers to the album in interviews as &quot;the fourth album&quot; and &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot;, and Plant thinks of it as &quot;the fourth album, that&#x27;s it&quot;. The original LP also has no text on the front or back cover, and lacks a catalogue number on the spine.

==Cover==
In place of a title, Page decided each member could choose a personal emblem for the cover. Initially thinking of a single symbol, he then decided there could be four, with each member of the band choosing his own. He designed his own symbol and has never publicly disclosed any reasoning behind it. It has been argued that his symbol appeared as early as 1557 to represent Saturn. The symbol is sometimes referred to as &quot;ZoSo&quot;, though Page has explained that it was not in fact intended to be a word at all. Jones&#x27; symbol, which he chose from Rudolf Koch&#x27;s &quot;Book of Signs&quot;, is a single circle intersecting three &quot;vesicae piscis&quot; (a triquetra). It is intended to symbolise a person who possesses both confidence and competence. Bonham&#x27;s symbol, the three interlocking (Borromean) rings, was picked by the drummer from the same book. It represents the triad of mother, father and child, but, also happens to be the logo for the steel and armament producer Krupp and, turned upside down, Ballantine beer. Plant&#x27;s symbol of a feather within a circle was his own design, being based on the sign of the supposed Mu civilisation. A fifth, smaller symbol chosen by guest vocalist Sandy Denny represents her contribution to &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot;; the figure, composed of three equilateral triangles, appears on the inner sleeve of the LP, serving as an asterisk.
During Led Zeppelin&#x27;s tour of the United Kingdom in winter 1971 shortly after the album&#x27;s release, the symbols could be seen on the group&#x27;s stage equipment; Page&#x27;s on one of his amplifiers, Bonham&#x27;s on his bass drum head, Jones&#x27; on a covering for his Rhodes piano, and Plant&#x27;s on the side of a PA cabinet. Only Page&#x27;s and Bonham&#x27;s symbols were retained for subsequent tours.

The picture on the front of the album of an old man carrying a bundle of sticks on his back was bought in an antique shop in Reading, Berkshire by Plant. The picture was then affixed to the internal, papered wall of a partly demolished suburban house for the cover photograph to be taken. Research in 2023 suggests that the image, which had previously been described as an oil painting, is a black and white photograph dating to 1892 which had been hand-coloured. The original photograph was taken by Ernest Howard Farmer (18561944), the first head of the school of photography at Regent Street Polytechnic. The research also suggests that the stooped figure is Lot Long (or Lot Longyear, 1823–1893), a thatcher from Mere, Wiltshire.

The block of flats seen on the album is Salisbury Tower in the Ladywood district of Birmingham. Page has explained that the cover of the fourth album was intended to bring out a city/country dichotomy that had initially surfaced on &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot;, and a reminder that people should look after the Earth. He later said the cover was supposed to be for &quot;other people to savour&quot; rather than a direct statement. The album cover was among the 10 chosen by the Royal Mail for a set of &quot;Classic Album Cover&quot; postage stamps issued in January 2010.

The inside illustration, entitled &quot;The Hermit&quot;, painted by Barrington Coleby (credited to Barrington Colby MOM on the album sleeve), was influenced by the design of the card of the same name in the Rider–Waite tarot deck. This character was later portrayed by Page himself in Led Zeppelin&#x27;s concert film, &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; (1976). The inner painting is also referred to as &quot;View in Half or Varying Light&quot;. The typeface for the lyrics to &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, printed on the inside sleeve of the album, was Page&#x27;s contribution. He found it in an Arts and Crafts magazine called &quot;The Studio&quot; which dated from the late 19th century. He thought the lettering was interesting and arranged for someone to create a whole alphabet.

==Release==
The album was released by Atlantic on 8 November 1971. It was promoted via a series of teaser advertisements showing the individual symbols on the album artwork. It entered the UK chart at No. 10, rising to No.1 the following week and has spent a total of 90 weeks on the chart. In the US it was Led Zeppelin&#x27;s best-selling album, but did not top the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart, peaking at No. 2 behind &quot;There&#x27;s a Riot Goin&#x27; On&quot; by Sly and the Family Stone and &quot;Music&quot; by Carole King. &quot;Ultimately&quot;, writes Lewis, &quot;the fourth Zeppelin album would be the most durable seller in their catalogue and the most impressive critical and commercial success of their career&quot;. At one point, it was ranked as one of the top five best-selling albums of all time. The album is one of the best-selling albums of all time with more than 37 million copies sold as of 2014. As of 2021, it is tied for fifth-highest-certified album in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America at 24× Platinum.

The album was reissued several times throughout the 1970s, including a lilac vinyl pressing in 1978, and a box set package in 1988. It was first issued on CD in the 1980s. Page remastered the album in 1990 with engineer George Marino in an attempt to update the catalogue, and several tracks were used for that year&#x27;s compilation &quot;Led Zeppelin Remasters&quot; and the &quot;Led Zeppelin Boxed Set&quot;. All remastered tracks were reissued on &quot;The Complete Studio Recordings&quot;, while the album was individually reissued on CD in 1994.

A remastered version of &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; was reissued on 27 October 2014, along with &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot;. The reissue comes in six formats: a standard CD edition, a deluxe two-CD edition, a standard LP version, a deluxe two-LP version, a super deluxe two-CD plus two-LP version with a hardback book, and as high-resolution 24-bit/96k digital downloads. The deluxe and super deluxe editions feature bonus material. The reissue was released with an inverted colour version of the original album&#x27;s artwork as its bonus disc&#x27;s cover. The album&#x27;s remastered version received widespread acclaim from critics, including &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, who found Page&#x27;s remastering &quot;illuminative&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; received overwhelming praise from critics. In a contemporary review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Lenny Kaye called it the band&#x27;s &quot;most consistently good&quot; album yet and praised the diversity of the songs: &quot;out of eight cuts, there isn&#x27;t one that steps on another&#x27;s toes, that tries to do too much all at once.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine called it a &quot;powerhouse album&quot; that has the commercial potential of the band&#x27;s previous three albums. Robert Christgau originally gave &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; a lukewarm review in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, but later called it a masterpiece of &quot;heavy rock&quot;. While still finding the band&#x27;s medieval ideas limiting, he believed the album showed them at the pinnacle of their songwriting, and regarded it as &quot;the definitive Led Zeppelin and hence heavy metal album&quot;.

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine credited the album for &quot;defining not only Led Zeppelin but the sound and style of &#x27;70s hard rock&quot;, while &quot;encompassing heavy metal, folk, pure rock &amp; roll, and blues&quot;. In his album guide to heavy metal, &quot;Spin&quot; magazine&#x27;s Joe Gross cited &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; as a &quot;monolithic cornerstone&quot; of the genre. BBC Music&#x27;s Daryl Easlea said that the album made the band a global success and effectively combined their third album&#x27;s folk ideas with their second album&#x27;s hard rock style, while Katherine Flynn and Julian Ring of &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; felt it featured their debut&#x27;s blues rock, along with the other styles from their second and third albums. Led Zeppelin&#x27;s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame biography described the album as &quot;a fully realized hybrid of the folk and hard-rock directions&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot; journalist AJ Ramirez regarded it as one of the greatest heavy metal albums ever, while Chuck Eddy named it the number one metal album of all time in his 1991 book &quot;Stairway to Hell: The 500 Best Heavy Metal Albums in the Universe&quot;. According to rock scholar Mablen Jones, &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; and particularly &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; reflected heavy metal&#x27;s presence in countercultural trends of the early 1970s, as the album &quot;blended post-hippie mysticism, mythological preoccupations, and hard rock&quot;.

Steven Hyden observed in 2018 that the album&#x27;s popularity had given rise to a reflexive bias against it from both fans and critics. &quot;There are two unwritten laws&quot; about the album, he wrote. The first was that a listener must claim a track from side two, the &quot;deep cuts with credibility&quot; side, was his or her favourite, and the second was that one should never say it was their favourite among the band&#x27;s albums. He blamed this later tendency for why &quot;rock critics who try too hard always make a case for &quot;In Through the Out Door&quot; being Zeppelin&#x27;s best.&quot; The band members themselves, he noted, also seemed to prefer performing the songs from side two in their solo shows.

===Accolades===
In 2000, &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; was named the 26th-greatest British album in a list by &quot;Q&quot; magazine. In 2002, &quot;Spin&quot; magazine&#x27;s Chuck Klosterman named it the second-greatest metal album of all time and said that it was &quot;the most famous hard-rock album ever recorded&quot; as well as an album that unintentionally created metal—&quot;the origin of &quot;everything&quot; that sounds, feels, or even tastes vaguely metallic&quot;. In 2000 it was voted number 42 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In 2003, the album was ranked number 66 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, then re-ranked number 69 in a 2012 revised list, and re-ranked 58 in a 2020 revised list. It was also named the seventh-best album of the 1970s in a list by &quot;Pitchfork&quot;. In 2016, Classic Rock magazine ranked &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; as the greatest of all Zeppelin albums.

<text>Houses of the Holy is the fifth studio album by the English rock band Led Zeppelin, released on 28 March 1973 in the United States and on 30 March 1973 in the United Kingdom by Atlantic Records. The album benefited from two band members installing studios at home, which allowed them to develop more sophisticated songs and arrangements and expand their musical style. Several songs subsequently became fixtures in the group&#x27;s live set, including &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot;, &quot;The Rain Song&quot; and &quot;No Quarter&quot;. Other material recorded at the sessions, including the title track, was shelved and released on the later albums &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; (1975) and &quot;Coda&quot; (1982). All instruments and vocals were provided by the band members Robert Plant (vocals), Jimmy Page (guitar), John Paul Jones (bass, keyboards), and John Bonham (drums). The album was produced by Page and mixed by Eddie Kramer. The cover was the first for the band to be designed by Hipgnosis and was based on a photograph taken at Giant&#x27;s Causeway in Northern Ireland.

Although critical response was mixed, &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; became a commercial success, later receiving a Diamond certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1999 for at least 10 million copies sold in the US. In 2020, the album was ranked at number 278 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 2020 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Recording==
By 1972, Led Zeppelin had achieved sustained commercial and critical success from both their studio albums and live shows. They were keen to record on location using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio as it had been an enjoyable experience for their untitled fourth album, released the previous year. After touring Australia, in April 1972 the group decided to take the mobile studio to Mick Jagger&#x27;s home, Stargroves, a manor house and country estate in Hampshire. Eddie Kramer returned as recording engineer.

Some songs from the album had initially been tried out in earlier sessions, such as &quot;No Quarter&quot;, which was first attempted during a session at Headley Grange Estate, in East Hampshire. Both guitarist and producer Jimmy Page and bassist / keyboardist John Paul Jones had installed home studios, which allowed them to arrive at Stargroves with complete compositions and arrangements.

Page&#x27;s home studio used some of the equipment from Pye Mobile Studios, which had been used to record the Who&#x27;s 1970 live album &quot;Live at Leeds&quot;. Because of his home studio, he was able to present a complete arrangement of &quot;The Rain Song&quot;, including non-standard guitar tunings and a variety of dynamics, and &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot;, featuring multiple guitar parts. Meanwhile, Jones had developed a new arrangement of &quot;No Quarter&quot;. Once the group were settled in Stargroves, they composed the other songs through jam sessions together. Further recording took place at Olympic Studios in May, and during the band&#x27;s 1972 North American tour additional recording sessions were conducted at Electric Lady Studios in New York. Some songs recorded during these various sessions did not make it onto &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot;, though several were released on later albums. A series of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll covers, including songs that appeared on Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Elvis&#x27; Golden Records&quot;, were recorded at Electric Lady Studios, which remain unreleased.

==Composition==
The album was a stylistic turning point for the band. The composition and production laid foundations for subsequent releases. According to the band&#x27;s biographer Dave Lewis, &quot;while the barnstorming effect of the early era was now levelling off, and though devoid of the electricity of &quot;Zeppelin I&quot; and &quot;II&quot;, the sheer diversity of the third album, and lacking the classic status of the fourth, &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; nevertheless found its rightful niche.&quot; The album largely abandoned their previous music&#x27;s weighty, dark blues rock distortion in favor of a clean, expansive rock sound—as evinced by Page&#x27;s sharper, brighter guitar tone. It was also likely the most eclectic musically of their albums, in the opinion of &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; writer Kristofer Lenz, who observed swing rhythms on &quot;Dancing Days&quot;, and experiments with reggae and psychedelic music on &quot;D&#x27;yer Mak&#x27;er&quot; and &quot;No Quarter&quot;, respectively. Pete Prown and HP Newquist have called it &quot;a diverse collection of rockers, ballads, reggae, funk, and fifties-style rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;.

===Side one===
The album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot;, was originally a Page-composed instrumental called &quot;The Overture&quot;. Plant added lyrics that referred to the group&#x27;s experiences on tour, and it was given a working title of &quot;The Campaign&quot;. His lead vocal was sped up slightly in the final mix, while Page played an electric twelve string guitar and a six-string electric. For live performances, he used the Gibson EDS-1275 double-neck guitar that was also used for playing &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; in concert.

&quot;The Rain Song&quot; was composed at Page&#x27;s home studio, including the entire arrangement and the vocal melody. He was inspired to write the song after George Harrison complained that Led Zeppelin &quot;never did any ballads&quot;. The opening chords are the same as Harrison&#x27;s song “Something” from The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. The backing track was recorded at Olympic, with a working title of &quot;Slush&quot;. Plant added some sensitive lyrics which matched the music, Jones added a string section played on the Mellotron, while Page played acoustic and Danelectro electric guitars in various different tunings. The song was regularly performed live, with Page using the Gibson EDS-1275. Page and Plant revived the track for their 1994–95 tour.

&quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot; was written about the hippie lifestyle, including references to the &quot;open road&quot;. The song was developed in two halves, with a quiet acoustic section leading into a livelier electric one. The song was one of the first to be introduced into Led Zeppelin&#x27;s live set, being first played in mid-1972.

&quot;The Crunge&quot; was written by Bonham and developed out of a jam at Stargroves. He decided to create a funk beat that stepped on and off the beat, making it impossible to dance to. Plant improvised a set of lyrics in the manner of James Brown over the music, parodying Brown&#x27;s &quot;Take it to the Bridge&quot; vocal style towards the end of the track. To further show that the song was a tongue-in-cheek joke, the group considered putting &quot;dance steps&quot; to the song on the cover at one stage. The track was occasionally performed as an impromptu piece in concert, usually in the middle of another song such as the fast guitar solo section in &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;.

===Side two===
&quot;Dancing Days&quot; was inspired by the enjoyable sessions at Stargroves, and the lyrics show a general optimism to life. Kramer recalled the group dancing around in the garden at Stargroves, listening to the playback of the final mix. A promotional copy of the track was sent out by Atlantic for radio play in March 1973, as a preview for the album.

&quot;D&#x27;yer Mak&#x27;er&quot; originated with Bonham trying to combine reggae with 1950s doo-wop by leaving a short off-beat. Jones later disapproved of the track, saying it was treated as a joke and not thought out well, but Plant thought it could be a hit and suggested it should be released as a single. Led Zeppelin&#x27;s general policy was to not release singles in the UK, and though test and promotional pressings were produced there, the rest of the group vetoed the idea. In the United States, it became a top 20 hit.

&quot;No Quarter&quot; was composed by Jones. An early arrangement of the song was attempted for their fourth album, but abandoned. Jones reworked the track to add acoustic and electric piano, and various synthesizers. The track quickly became a live favourite, and was featured at every show from 1973 through 1979, providing Jones with an extended solo showcase in the middle, and a jam session with a variety of different styles. Plant revived the song for his 1990 tour, and it was performed by Page and Plant in 1994. Jones performed a solo instrumental performance on tour in 1999, and Plant performed it solo again in 2005. It was part of the set at the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in 2007.

&quot;The Ocean&quot; began with Bonham shouting &quot;We&#x27;ve done four already but now we&#x27;re steady and then they went, one, two, three, four,&quot; referring to the number of takes already recorded. The title and lyrics refer to the group&#x27;s fans and their devotion to the band. The middle of the track features an a cappella vocal break sung by Plant, Bonham and Jones, while the ending was another pastiche of the doo-wop style.

===Unreleased material===
The album&#x27;s title track was recorded at Olympic and mixed at Electric Lady. It was ultimately left off the album, as there were enough tracks to fill two sides of an LP, and was released on the follow-up, &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; in 1975. That album also included two songs from &quot;Houses of the Holy&#x27;s&quot; Stargroves sessions, &quot;The Rover&quot; and &quot;Black Country Woman&quot; (the latter recorded in the outdoor garden).

Another track from the Stargroves sessions, &quot;Walter&#x27;s Walk&quot;, was eventually released on &quot;Coda&quot; in 1982.

==Packaging==

&quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; was the first album by the group to have an explicit title that was not eponymous, but like the previous one, neither the band&#x27;s name nor the album title was printed on the sleeve. However, manager Peter Grant did allow Atlantic Records to add a wrap-around paper title band to US copies of the sleeve that had to be broken or slid off to access the record. The first CD release of the album in the 1980s had the title logos printed on the cover itself.

The cover art for &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; was inspired by Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s novel &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot;. The cover is a collage of several photographs which were taken at the Giant&#x27;s Causeway, Northern Ireland, by Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. This location was chosen ahead of an alternative one in Peru which had also been considered.

The photo shoot featured two naked child models, Stefan and Samantha Gates. It was a frustrating affair over the course of 10 days. Shooting was done first thing in the morning and at sunset in order to capture the light at dawn and dusk, but the desired effect was never achieved due to constant rain and clouds. The photos of the two children were taken in black and white and were multi-printed to create the effect of 11 individuals that can be seen on the album cover. The results were unsatisfactory, but some accidental tinting effects in post-production created a suitable cover. The inner gatefold photograph was taken at Dunluce Castle nearby the Causeway. In February 2010, Stefan Gates was featured on a BBC Radio 4 documentary about the cover. He said there was something sinister about the image, though his sister disagreed. He also admitted never having heard the album. The programme ended with Gates returning to Giant&#x27;s Causeway and listening to the album on a portable player, after which he said that a great weight had been lifted from him. Samantha also appeared on the back cover of the band&#x27;s 1976 album &quot;Presence&quot;.

Page has stated that the album cover was the second version submitted by Hipgnosis. The first, by artist Storm Thorgerson, featured an electric green tennis court with a tennis racket on it. Furious that Thorgerson was implying, by means of a visual pun, that their music sounded like a &quot;racket&quot;, the band fired him and hired Powell in his place.

In 1974, the album was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of Best Album Package. The cover was rated number 6 on VH1&#x27;s 50 Greatest Album Covers in 2003.

==Release and reception==

This was Led Zeppelin&#x27;s final studio release on Atlantic Records before forming their own label, Swan Song Records, in 1974, which would be distributed by Atlantic. It was also the only Led Zeppelin album that contained complete printed lyrics for each song.

Although intended for release in January 1973, delays in producing the album cover meant that it was not released until March, when the band was on its 1973 European tour. The album was promoted heavily before the commencement of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s subsequent North American Tour, ensuring that it had ascended the top of the American chart by the beginning of the tour. Because much of the album had been recorded almost a year previously, many of the songs which are featured on the album had already been played live by Led Zeppelin on their concert tours of North America, Japan, Europe and the UK in 1972–73.

&quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; originally received mixed reviews, with much criticism from the music press being directed at the off-beat nature of tracks such as &quot;The Crunge&quot; and &quot;D&#x27;yer Mak&#x27;er&quot;. Gordon Fletcher from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the album &quot;one of the dullest and most confusing albums I&#x27;ve heard this year&quot;, believing the band had digressed from &quot;the epitome of everything good about rock&quot; to a watered down heavy metal act. However, the album was a commercial success and topped the UK charts and spent 39 weeks on the Billboard 200 albums chart including two weeks at number one (their longest stint since &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot;). The album was number four on Billboard magazine&#x27;s top albums of 1973 year end chart.

In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau appraised &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; favourably. While mocking the solemnity of &quot;No Quarter&quot; and finding some tracks derivative of previous albums, he found side one &quot;solid led&quot; with &quot;sprung rhythm&quot; and a &quot;James Brown tribute/parody/ripoff&quot; in &quot;The Crunge&quot; that complements the second side&#x27;s &quot;two amazing, well, dance tracks&quot; in &quot;Dancing Dayss &quot;transmogrified shuffle&quot; and the reggae of &quot;D&#x27;yer Mak&#x27;er&quot;. &quot;Throughout the record, the band&#x27;s playing is excellent,&quot; wrote AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine, &quot;making the eclecticism of Page and Robert Plant&#x27;s songwriting sound coherent and natural.&quot;

In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it at number 149 on the magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time.&quot; It was re-ranked at number 148 in a 2012 revised list, and re-ranked at number 278 in 2020. In 1991, Chuck Eddy ranked &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; 45th in his book of the 500 best heavy metal albums, writing that as with &quot;the Byrds in the sixties and college radio in the eighties&quot;, the band &quot;forfeit hookage for janglage&quot;. He noted that despite fans of the band&#x27;s &quot;lead mode&quot; being critical of the funk and reggae excursions, &quot;fun&quot; songs like those and &quot;Dancing Days&quot; mark the album&#x27;s best material, highlighting Bonham&#x27;s great steel drum-esque sounds on &quot;D&#x27;yer Maker&quot;, as well as praising &quot;The Rain Song&quot; for being &quot;my kinda new age&quot;.

==2014 reissue==

A remastered version of &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; was reissued on 27 October 2014, along with &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot;. The reissue comes in six formats: a standard CD edition, a deluxe two-CD edition, a standard LP version, a deluxe two-LP version, a super deluxe two-CD plus two-LP version with a hardback book, and as high resolution 24-bit/96k digital downloads. The deluxe and super deluxe editions feature bonus material. The reissue was released with an altered-colour version of the original album&#x27;s artwork as its bonus disc&#x27;s cover.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the reissue received an average score of 98, based on nine reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; writer Kristofer Lenz said, &quot;The remastering of this album is a blessing to the careful compositions and mannered performances throughout the record.&quot; &quot;&quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; might be Zeppelin&#x27;s most impressive album on a purely sonic level,&quot; wrote &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Mark Richardson, &quot;and this particular remaster reinforces that notion.&quot; He was disappointed, however, by the bonus disc of alternate mixes, which merely provide &quot;a chance to hear familiar performances in familiar songs in a way that sounds slightly unfamiliar&quot;.

<text>A sugar beet is a plant whose root contains a high concentration of sucrose and that is grown commercially for sugar production. In plant breeding, it is known as the Altissima cultivar group of the common beet (&quot;Beta vulgaris&quot;). Together with other beet cultivars, such as beetroot and chard, it belongs to the subspecies &quot;Beta vulgaris&quot; subsp. &quot;vulgaris&quot; but classified as &quot;var. saccharifera&quot;. Its closest wild relative is the sea beet (&quot;Beta vulgaris&quot; subsp. &quot;maritima&quot;).

Sugar beets are grown in climates that are too cold for sugarcane. In 2020, Russia, the United States, Germany, France and Turkey were the world&#x27;s five largest sugar beet producers. In 2010–2011, Europe, and North America except Arctic territories failed to supply the overall domestic demand for sugar and were all net importers of sugar. The US harvested of sugar beets in 2008. In 2009, sugar beets accounted for 20% of the world&#x27;s sugar production and nearly 30% by 2013. Sugarcane accounts for most of the rest of sugar produced globally. In February 2015, a USDA factsheet reported that sugar beets generally account for about 55 percent of domestically produced sugar, and sugar cane for about 45 percent.

== Description ==
The sugar beet has a conical, white, fleshy root (a taproot) with a flat crown. The plant consists of the root and a rosette of leaves. Sugar is formed by photosynthesis in the leaves and is then stored in the root.

The root of the beet contains 75% water, about 20% sugar, and 5% pulp. The exact sugar content can vary between 12% and 21%, depending on the cultivar and growing conditions. Sugar is the primary value of sugar beet as a cash crop. The pulp, insoluble in water and mainly composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and pectin, is used in animal feed. The byproducts of the sugar beet crop, such as pulp and molasses, add another 10% to the value of the harvest.

Sugar beets grow exclusively in the temperate zone, in contrast to sugarcane, which grows exclusively in the tropical and subtropical zones. The average weight of a sugar beet ranges between . Sugar beet foliage has a rich, brilliant green color and grows to a height of about . The leaves are numerous and broad and grow in a tuft from the crown of the beet, which is usually level with or just above the ground surface.

== History of the sugar beet ==

=== Discovery of beet sugar ===


The species beet consists of several cultivar groups. The 16th-century French scientist Olivier de Serres discovered a process for preparing sugar syrup from (red) beetroot. He wrote: &quot;The beet-root, when being boiled, yields a juice similar to syrup of sugar, which is beautiful to look at on account of its vermilion colour&quot; (1575). Because crystallized cane sugar was already available and had a better taste, this process did not become popular.

Modern sugar beets date to the mid-18th century Silesia, where Frederick the Great, king of Prussia, subsidized experiments to develop processes for sugar extraction. In 1747, Andreas Sigismund Marggraf, professor of physics in the Academy of Science of Berlin, isolated sugar from beetroots and found them at concentrations of 1.3–1.6%. He also demonstrated that the sugar that could be extracted from beets was identical to that produced from cane. He found the best of these vegetable sources for sugar was the white beet. Despite Marggraf&#x27;s success in isolating sugar from beets, it did not lead to commercial sugar production.

=== Development of the sugar beet ===
Marggraf&#x27;s student and successor Franz Karl Achard began plant breeding sugar beet in Kaulsdorf near Berlin in 1786. Achard started his plant breeding by evaluating 23 varieties of beet for sugar content. In the end he selected a local strain from Halberstadt in modern-day Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Moritz Baron von Koppy and his son further selected white, conical tubers from this strain. The selection was named &quot;weiße schlesische Zuckerrübe&quot;, meaning white Silesian sugar beet. In about 1800, this cultivar contained about 5% to 6% sucrose by (dry) weight. It went on to become the progenitor of all modern sugar beets. The plant breeding process has continued since then, leading to a sucrose content of around 18% in modern varieties.

=== History of the beet sugar industry ===
Franz Karl Achard opened the world&#x27;s first beet sugar factory in 1801, at Kunern, Silesia (now Konary, Poland). The idea to produce sugar from beet was soon introduced to France, whence the European sugar beet industry rapidly expanded. By 1840, about 5% of the world&#x27;s sugar was derived from sugar beets, and by 1880, this number had risen more than tenfold to over 50%. In North America, the first commercial production started in 1879 at a farm in Alvarado, California. The sugar beet was introduced to Chile by German settlers around 1850.

== Culture ==


The sugar beet, like sugarcane, needs a particular soil and a proper climate for its successful cultivation. The most important requirements are that the soil must contain a large supply of nutrients, be rich in humus, and be able to contain a great deal of moisture. A certain amount of alkali is not necessarily detrimental, as sugar beets are not especially susceptible to injury by some alkali. The ground should be fairly level and well-drained, especially where irrigation is practiced.

Generous crops can be grown in both sandy soil and heavy loams, but the ideal soil is a sandy loam, i.e., a mixture of organic matter, clay and sand. A subsoil of gravel, or the presence of hardpan, is not desirable, as cultivation to a depth of from is necessary to produce the best results.

Climatic conditions, temperature, sunshine, rainfall and winds have an important bearing upon the success of sugar beet agriculture. A temperature ranging from during the growing months is most favorable. In the absence of adequate irrigation, of rainfall are necessary to raise an average crop. High winds are harmful, as they generally crust the land and prevent the young beets from coming through the ground. The best results are obtained along the coast of southern California, where warm, sunny days succeeded by cool, foggy nights seem to meet sugar beet&#x27;s favored growth conditions. Sunshine of long duration but not of great intensity is the most important factor in the successful cultivation of sugar beets. Near the equator, the shorter days and the greater heat of the sun sharply reduce the sugar content in the beet.

In high elevation regions such as those of Idaho, Colorado and Utah, where the temperature is high during the daytime, but where the nights are cool, the quality of the sugar beet is excellent. In Michigan, the long summer days from the relatively high latitude (the Lower Peninsula, where production is concentrated, lies between the 41st and 46th parallels North) and the influence of the Great Lakes result in satisfactory climatic conditions for sugar beet culture. Sebewaing, Michigan, lies in the Thumb region of Michigan; both the region and state are major sugar beet producers. Sebewaing is home to one of four Michigan Sugar Company factories. The town sponsors an annual Michigan Sugar Festival.

To cultivate beets successfully, the land must be properly prepared. Deep ploughing is the first principle of beet culture. It allows the roots to penetrate the subsoil without much obstruction, thereby preventing the beet from growing out of the ground, besides enabling it to extract considerable nourishment and moisture from the lower soil. If the latter is too hard, the roots will not penetrate it readily and, as a result, the plant will be pushed up and out of the earth during the process of growth. A hard subsoil is impervious to water and prevents proper drainage. It should not be too loose, however, as this allows the water to pass through more freely than is desirable. Ideally, the soil should be deep, fairly fine and easily penetrable by the roots. It should also be capable of retaining moisture and at the same time admit of a free circulation of air and good drainage. Sugar beet crops exhaust the soil rapidly. Crop rotation is recommended and necessary. Normally, beets are grown in the same ground every third year, peas, beans or grain being raised the other two years.

In most temperate climates, beets are planted in the spring and harvested in the autumn. At the northern end of its range, growing seasons as short as 100 days can produce commercially viable sugar beet crops. In warmer climates, such as in California&#x27;s Imperial Valley, sugar beets are a winter crop, planted in the autumn and harvested in the spring. In recent years, Syngenta has developed the so-called tropical sugar beet. It allows the plant to grow in tropical and subtropical regions. Beets are planted from a small seed; of beet seed comprises 100,000 seeds and will plant over of ground ( will plant about .

Until the latter half of the 20th century, sugar beet production was highly labor-intensive, as weed control was managed by densely planting the crop, which then had to be manually thinned two or three times with a hoe during the growing season. Harvesting also required many workers. Although the roots could be lifted by a plough-like device that could be pulled by a horse team, the rest of the preparation was by hand. One laborer grabbed the beets by their leaves, knocked them together to shake free loose soil, and then laid them in a row, root to one side, greens to the other. A second worker equipped with a beet hook (a short-handled tool between a billhook and a sickle) followed behind, and would lift the beet and swiftly chop the crown and leaves from the root with a single action. Working this way, he would leave a row of beets that could be forked into the back of a cart.

Today, mechanical sowing, herbicide application for weed control, and mechanical harvesting have displaced this reliance on manual farm work. A root beater uses a series of blades to chop the leaf and crown (which is high in nonsugar impurities) from the root. The beet harvester lifts the root, and removes excess soil from the root in a single pass over the field. A modern harvester is typically able to cover six rows at the same time. The beets are dumped into trucks as the harvester rolls down the field, and then delivered to the factory. The conveyor then removes more soil.

If the beets are to be left for later delivery, they are formed into clamps. Straw bales are used to shield the beets from the weather. Provided the clamp is well built with the right amount of ventilation, the beets do not significantly deteriorate. Beets that freeze and then defrost, produce complex carbohydrates that cause severe production problems in the factory. In the UK, loads may be hand examined at the factory gate before being accepted.

In the US, the fall harvest begins with the first hard frost, which arrests photosynthesis and the further growth of the root. Depending on the local climate, it may be carried out over the course of a few weeks or be prolonged throughout the winter months. The harvest and processing of the beet is referred to as &quot;the campaign&quot;, reflecting the organization required to deliver the crop at a steady rate to processing factories that run 24 hours a day for the duration of the harvest and processing (for the UK, the campaign lasts about five months). In the Netherlands, this period is known as , a time to be careful when driving on local roads in the area while the beets are being grown, because the naturally high clay content of the soil tends to cause slippery roads when soil falls from the trailers during transport.

==Production statistics==
The world harvested of sugar beets in 2022. The world&#x27;s largest producer was Russia, with a harvest. The average yield of sugar beet crops worldwide was 60.8 tonnes per hectare.

The most productive sugar beet farms in the world, in 2022, were in Chile, with a nationwide average yield of 106.2 tonnes per hectare.

Imperial Valley (California) farmers have achieved yields of about 160 tonnes per hectare and over 26 tonnes sugar per hectare. Imperial Valley farms benefit from high intensities of incident sunlight and intensive use of irrigation and fertilizers.

== From sugar beet to white sugar ==
Most sugar beet are used to create white sugar. This is done in a beet sugar factory, often abbreviated to sugar factory. Nowadays these usually also act as a sugar refinery, but historically the beet sugar factory produced raw sugar and the sugar refinery refined raw sugar to create white sugar. 

=== Sugar factory ===

In the 1960s, beet sugar processing was described as consisting of these steps.

* Harvesting and storage in a way that preserves the beet while they wait to be processed
* Washing and scrubbing to remove soil and debris
* Slicing the beet in small pieces called cossettes or chips
* Removing the sugar from the beet in an osmosis process, resulting in raw juice and beet pulp. 

Nowadays, most sugar factories then refine the raw juice themselves, without moving it to a sugar refinery. The beet pulp is processed on site to become cattle fodder.

=== Sugar refinery ===
The next steps to produce white sugar are not specific for producing sugar from sugar beet. They also apply to producing white sugar from sugar cane. As such, they belong to the sugar refining process, not to the beet sugar production process per se.

* Purification, the raw juice undergoes a chemical process to remove impurities and create thin juice.
* Evaporation, the thin juice is concentrated by evaporation to make a &quot;thick juice&quot;, roughly 60% sucrose by weight.
* Crystallization, by boiling under reduced pressure the sugar liquor is turned into crystals and remaining liquor. 
* Centrifugation, in a centrifuge the white sugar crystals are separated from the remaining sugar liquor.
* The remaining liquor is then boiled and centrifuged, producing a lower grade of crystallised sugar (which is redissolved to feed the white sugar pans) and molasses.
* Further sugar can be recovered from the molasses by methods such as the Steffen Process.

== Ethanol and alcohol ==

=== From molasses ===

There are two obvious methods to produce alcohol (ethanol) from sugar beet. The first method produces alcohol as a byproduct of manufacturing sugar. It is about fermenting the sugar beet molasses that are left after (the second) centrifugation. This strongly resembles the manufacture of rum from sugar cane molasses. In a number of countries, notably the Czech Republic and Slovakia, this analogy led to making a rum-like distilled spirit called &quot;Tuzemak&quot;. On the Åland Islands, a similar drink is made under the brand name &quot;Kobba Libre&quot;.

=== From sugar beet ===
The second method to produce alcohol from sugar beet is to ferment the sugar beet themselves. I.e. without attempting to produce sugar. The idea to distill sugar from the beet came up soon after the first beet sugar factory was established. Between 1852 and 1854 Champonnois devised a good system to distill alcohol from sugar beet. Within a few years a large sugar distilling industry was created in France. The current process to produce alcohol by fermenting and distilling sugar beet consists of these steps:

* Adding Starch milk
* Liquefaction and Saccharification
* Fermentation in fermentation vats
* Distillation
* Dehydration, this results in Bioethanol
* Rectification
* Refining, the result is a highly pure alcohol 

Large sugar beet distilleries remain limited to Europe. In 2023 Tereos had 8 beet sugar distilleries, located in France, Czechia and Romania. 

In many European countries rectified spirit from sugar beet is used to make Liquor, e.g. vodka, Gin etc..

== Other uses ==
=== Sugary syrup ===

An unrefined sugary syrup can be produced directly from sugar beet. This thick, dark syrup is produced by cooking shredded sugar beet for several hours, then pressing the resulting mash and concentrating the juice produced until it has a consistency similar to that of honey. No other ingredients are used. 

In Germany, particularly the Rhineland area, and in the Netherlands, this sugar beet syrup (called &quot;Zuckerrüben-Sirup&quot; or &quot;Zapp&quot; in German, or &quot;Suikerstroop&quot; in Dutch) is used as a spread for sandwiches, as well as for sweetening sauces, cakes and desserts. Dutch people generally top their pancakes with stroop.

Suikerstroop made according to the Dutch tradition is a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed under EU and UK law. Commercially, if the syrup has a dextrose equivalency (DE) above 30, the product has to be hydrolyzed and converted to a high-fructose syrup, much like high-fructose corn syrup, or isoglucose syrup in the EU.

=== Uridine ===
Uridine can be isolated from sugar beet.

=== Alternative fuel ===
BP and Associated British Foods plan to use agricultural surpluses of sugar beet to produce biobutanol in East Anglia in the United Kingdom.

The feedstock-to-yield ratio for sugarbeet is 56:9. Therefore, it takes 6.22 kg of sugar beet to produce 1 kg of ethanol (approximately 1.27 L at room temperature). In 2006 it was found that producing ethanol from sugar beet or cane became profitable when market prices for ethanol were close to $4 per gallon. According to Atlantic Biomass president Robert Kozak, a study at University of Maryland Eastern Shore indicates sugar beets appear capable of producing 860 to 900 gallons (3,256 to 3,407 liters) of ethanol per acre.

=== Cattle feed ===
In New Zealand, sugar beet is widely grown and harvested as feed for dairy cattle. It is regarded as superior to fodder beet, because it has a lower water content (resulting in better storage properties). Both the beet bulb and the leaves (with 25% protein) are fed to cattle. Although long considered toxic to cattle, harvested beet bulbs can be fed to cattle if they are appropriately transitioned to their new diet. Dairy cattle in New Zealand can thrive on just pasture and beets, without silage or other supplementary feed. The crop is also now grown in some parts of Australia as cattle feed.

=== Monosodium glutamate ===
Molasses can serve to produce monosodium glutamate (MSG).

== Agriculture ==
Sugar beets are an important part of a crop rotation cycle.

Sugar beet plants are susceptible to &quot;Rhizomania&quot; (&quot;root madness&quot;), which turns the bulbous tap root into many small roots, making the crop economically unprocessable. Strict controls are enforced in European countries to prevent the spread, but it is already present in some areas. It is also susceptible to both the beet leaf curl virus, which causes crinkling and stunting of the leaves and beet yellows virus.

Continual research looks for varieties with resistance, as well as increased sugar yield. Sugar beet breeding research in the United States is most prominently conducted at various USDA Agricultural Research Stations, including one in Fort Collins, Colorado, headed by Linda Hanson and Leonard Panella; one in Fargo, North Dakota, headed by John Wieland; and one at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan, headed by Rachel Naegele.

Other economically important members of the subfamily Chenopodioideae:
* Beetroot
* Chard
* &quot;Mangelwurzel&quot; or fodder beet

===Genetic modification===

In the United States, genetically modified sugar beets, engineered for resistance to glyphosate, a herbicide marketed as Roundup, were developed by Monsanto as a genetically modified crop. In 2005, the US Department of Agriculture-Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) deregulated glyphosate-resistant sugar beets after it conducted an environmental assessment and determined glyphosate-resistant sugar beets were highly unlikely to become a plant pest. Sugar from glyphosate-resistant sugar beets has been approved for human and animal consumption in multiple countries, but commercial production of biotech beets has been approved only in the United States and Canada. Studies have concluded the sugar from glyphosate-resistant sugar beets has the same nutritional value as sugar from conventional sugar beets. After deregulation in 2005, glyphosate-resistant sugar beets were extensively adopted in the United States. About 95% of sugar beet acres in the US were planted with glyphosate-resistant seed in 2011.

Weeds may be chemically controlled using glyphosate without harming the crop. After planting sugar beet seed, weeds emerge in fields and growers apply glyphosate to control them. Glyphosate is commonly used in field crops because it controls a broad spectrum of weed species and has a low toxicity. A study from the UK suggests yields of genetically modified beet were greater than conventional, while another from the North Dakota State University extension service found lower yields. The introduction of glyphosate-resistant sugar beets may contribute to the growing number of glyphosate-resistant weeds, so Monsanto has developed a program to encourage growers to use different herbicide modes of action to control their weeds.

In 2008, the Center for Food Safety, the Sierra Club, the Organic Seed Alliance and High Mowing Seeds filed a lawsuit against USDA-APHIS regarding their decision to deregulate glyphosate-resistant sugar beets in 2005. The organizations expressed concerns regarding glyphosate-resistant sugar beets&#x27; ability to potentially cross-pollinate with conventional sugar beets. U.S. District Judge Jeffrey S. White, US District Court for the Northern District of California, revoked the deregulation of glyphosate-resistant sugar beets and declared it unlawful for growers to plant glyphosate-resistant sugar beets in the spring of 2011. Believing a sugar shortage would occur USDA-APHIS developed three options in the environmental assessment to address the concerns of environmentalists. In 2011, a federal appeals court for the Northern district of California in San Francisco overturned the ruling. In July 2012, after completing an environmental impact assessment and a plant pest risk assessment the USDA deregulated Monsanto&#x27;s Roundup Ready sugar beets.

== Genome and genetics ==
The sugar beet genome shares a triplication event somewhere super-Caryophyllales and at or sub-Eudicots. It has been sequenced and two reference genome sequences have already been generated. The genome size of the sugar beet is approximately 731 (714–758) Megabases, and sugar beet DNA is packaged in 18 metacentric chromosomes (2n=2x=18). All sugar beet centromeres are made up of a single satellite DNA family and centromere-specific LTR retrotransposons. More than 60% of sugar beet&#x27;s DNA is repetitive, mostly distributed in a dispersed way along the chromosomes.

Crop wild beet populations (&quot;B. vulgaris&quot; ssp. &quot;maritima&quot;) have been sequenced as well, allowing for identification of the resistance gene &quot;Rz2&quot; in the wild progenitor. &quot;Rz2&quot; confers resistance to rhizomania, commonly known as the sugar beet root madness disease.

==Breeding==
Sugar beets have been bred for increased sugar content, from 8% to 18% in the 200 years , resistance to viral and fungal diseases, increased taproot size, monogermy, and less bolting. Breeding has been eased by discovery of a cytoplasmic male sterility line – this has especially been useful in yield breeding.

<text>Physical Graffiti is the sixth studio album by the English rock band Led Zeppelin. Released as a double album on 24 February 1975 in the United States and on 28 February 1975 in the United Kingdom, it was the group&#x27;s first album to be released under their new label, Swan Song Records. The band wrote and recorded eight new songs for the album in early 1974 at Headley Grange, a country house in Hampshire, which gave them ample time to improvise arrangements and experiment with recording. The total playing time covered just under three sides of an LP, so they decided to expand it into a double album by including seven previously unreleased tracks from the sessions for the band&#x27;s earlier albums &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot; (1970), &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; (1971) and &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; (1973). The album covered a range of styles including hard rock, progressive rock, rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and folk. The album was then mixed over summer 1974 and planned for an end-of-year release; however, its release was delayed because the Peter Corriston-designed die-cut album cover proved difficult to manufacture.

&quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; was commercially and critically successful upon its release and debuted at number one on album charts in the UK and number three in the United States. It was promoted by a successful U.S. tour and a five-night residency at Earl&#x27;s Court, London. The album has been reissued on CD several times, including an expansive 40th anniversary edition in 2015. &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; was later certified 16× platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2006, signifying shipments of over eight million copies in the US.

==Recording==
The first attempt by Led Zeppelin to record songs for &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; took place in November 1973 at Headley Grange in Hampshire, England, where they had previously recorded their untitled fourth album. The recording equipment consisted of Ronnie Lane&#x27;s Mobile Studio. Guitarist and producer Jimmy Page and drummer John Bonham recorded an instrumental which was later reworked as &quot;Kashmir&quot; during this visit. However, these sessions came to a halt quickly and the studio time was turned over to Bad Company, who used it to record songs for their debut album. The press reported that bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones was ill and unable to record. However, he had become disillusioned with the group and tired of touring, and told manager Peter Grant he was considering quitting. Grant asked him to reconsider and to take the rest of the year off to recuperate.

The group reconvened at Headley Grange in January and February 1974, where they recorded eight tracks engineered by Ron Nevison. Lead singer Robert Plant later referred to these eight tracks as &quot;the belters,&quot; including &quot;off-the-wall stuff that turned out really nice.&quot; As with previous sessions at Headley Grange, the informal atmosphere allowed the group to improvise and develop material while recording. Sometimes the group would rehearse or record a track several times, discuss what went wrong or what could be improved and then realized they&#x27;d worked out an alternative arrangement for it which was better. Bonham was a driving force at the sessions, regularly suggesting ideas or the best ways in which a complicated arrangement could be played successfully. This led to him getting a lead songwriting credit on several tracks.

The eight songs extended beyond the length of a conventional album, almost spanning three sides of an LP, so the group decided to create a double album, adding material they&#x27;d recorded for previous albums but never issued. This included various jam sessions such as &quot;Boogie With Stu,&quot; which Page thought would be unsuitable as a track on a single album. Additional overdubs were laid down, and the final mixing of the album was performed in July 1974 by Keith Harwood at Olympic Studios, London. The title &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; was coined by Page to illustrate the whole physical and written energy that had gone into producing the set.

==Songs==

The album spanned several years of recording and covered a range of musical styles, including hard rock (&quot;Custard Pie&quot;, &quot;The Rover&quot;, &quot;The Wanton Song&quot;, &quot;Sick Again&quot;, &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot;), eastern-influenced orchestral rock (&quot;Kashmir&quot;), progressive rock (&quot;In the Light&quot;), driving funk (&quot;Trampled Under Foot&quot;), acoustic rock and roll (&quot;Boogie with Stu&quot;, &quot;Black Country Woman&quot;), love ballad (&quot;Ten Years Gone&quot;), blues rock (&quot;In My Time of Dying&quot;), soft rock (&quot;Down by the Seaside&quot;), country rock romp (&quot;Night Flight&quot;), and acoustic guitar instrumental (&quot;Bron-Yr-Aur&quot;).

Several tracks from the album became live staples at Led Zeppelin concerts. In particular, &quot;In My Time of Dying&quot;, &quot;Trampled Under Foot&quot;, &quot;Kashmir&quot;, &quot;Ten Years Gone&quot;, &quot;Black Country Woman&quot;, and &quot;Sick Again&quot; became regular components of the band&#x27;s live concert set lists following the release of the album.

===Side one===
&quot;Custard Pie&quot; was recorded at Headley Grange in early 1974. The first take was played at a faster tempo than the finished version, with various improvised vocals. After a basic run-through, the group then discussed possibilities for rearranging it. Page played the guitar solo through an ARP synthesiser, while Jones overdubbed a Hohner Clavinet part and Plant played harmonica.

&quot;The Rover&quot; was written in 1970 at Bron-Yr-Aur, a cottage near Machynlleth, Wales. It was first recorded at Headley Grange in May 1970 as an acoustic number for &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot;. It was reworked as an electric number in 1972 for &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot;, which formed the basis for the backing track. Page subsequently added guitar overdubs in 1974 with Keith Harwood engineering.

&quot;In My Time of Dying&quot; is based on a traditional song that Bob Dylan recorded on his debut album in 1962. The track was recorded live, with Page later adding further slide guitar overdubs. The arranging and structuring was led by Bonham, who worked out where the various stop / start sections in the track should be, and how the group would know where to come back in. The very end of the song features his off-mic cough, causing the rest of the group to break down at that point. Bonham subsequently shouted &quot;That&#x27;s got to be the one, hasn&#x27;t it?&quot;, feeling it was the best take. It was left on the album to show fans that Led Zeppelin were a working band that took care in their recordings.

===Side two===
&quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; was recorded as the title track for the album of the same name in May 1972 at Olympic Studios with Eddie Kramer engineering. It was left off that album because of its similarity to other tracks such as &quot;Dancing Days&quot;, which were felt to be better. Unlike some of the other older material on &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot;, it required no further overdubbing or remixing.

&quot;Trampled Under Foot&quot; developed from a jam session driven by Jones at the Clavinet. The song went through several arrangement changes before arriving at the version heard on the album, with the group rehearsing various different ideas and arguing about the overall style. Bonham decided the track was too &quot;souly&quot; and rearranged it into a funk style, suggesting that Page should play a guitar riff throughout in place of chords. The lyrics are a series of double entendres around driving and cars. The song quickly became a popular live piece that was played at every live show from 1975 onwards, and was later revived by Plant for his solo tours. It was released as a single in the US on 2 April (with &quot;Black Country Woman&quot; as the B-side) and was a top 40 hit.

&quot;Kashmir&quot; was an idea from Page and Bonham, and was first attempted as an instrumental demo in late 1973. Plant wrote the lyrics while on holiday in Morocco. Jones played Mellotron on the track, and arranged strings and brass parts that were played by session musicians. The song was one of the most critically acclaimed on the album, and was played at every gig from 1975 onwards. Page and Plant played it on their 1994 tour, and it was reworked in 1998 by Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs for his single &quot;Come With Me&quot; which featured Page on guitar.

===Side three===
&quot;In the Light&quot; was recorded at Headley Grange in early 1974. It was initially called &quot;In the Morning&quot; and went through several rehearsals and takes to work out a basic structure. A drone/chant introduction was later added to the piece.

&quot;Bron-Yr-Aur&quot; was a solo acoustic piece by Page, named after the cottage where he had composed and arranged much of &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot; with Plant. It was recorded at Island Studios in mid-1970. The track was later used as background music in the group&#x27;s film &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot;.

&quot;Down by the Seaside&quot; was originally written as an acoustic track at Bron-Yr-Aur in 1970, and was influenced by Neil Young. It was reworked as an electric track during sessions for the fourth album the following year. Page and Bonham led the arranging, changing tempo from the slow to fast section and then back again.

&quot;Ten Years Gone&quot; was mostly composed by Plant about an old love affair, and was combined with an instrumental piece from Page, featuring overdubbed electric and acoustic guitar parts. When the track was performed live, Jones played a triple-neck guitar featuring mandolin, six- and 12-string guitars, in order to try to reproduce the various guitar overdubs on the studio recording.

===Side four===

&quot;Night Flight&quot; was recorded at Headley Grange in 1971 for the fourth album. Besides the usual bass, Jones plays Hammond organ on the track, and Page plays guitar through a Leslie speaker. Plant wrote the lyrics after reading a news headline entitled &quot;Nuclear Damage Test Threat&quot; and wondered why there seemed to be little peace and love in the world.

&quot;The Wanton Song&quot; was built around a Page guitar riff. Unlike some of the other tracks recorded at the 1974 Headley Grange sessions, it was straightforward to arrange, with the group building the song around the riffs.

&quot;Boogie with Stu&quot; was a jam session with Rolling Stones pianist Ian Stewart based around the Ritchie Valens song &quot;Ooh My Head&quot;. It was recorded in 1971 at Headley Grange during the same session that produced &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; for the group&#x27;s fourth album. It did not credit Valens or Bob Keane, instead crediting Valens&#x27; mother. Eventually a lawsuit was filed by Keane, and half of the award went to Valens&#x27; mother, although she was not part of the suit.

&quot;Black Country Woman&quot; was recorded in the garden at Stargroves in 1972 for &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot;, as part of the group&#x27;s desire to work in &quot;off the wall&quot; locations outside a traditional studio environment. The track was nearly abandoned when an aeroplane cruised overhead, but it was left on the final recording for effect.

&quot;Sick Again&quot; was written by Page and Plant about the 1973 tour and their experience with meeting groupies. The track was driven by Bonham&#x27;s drumming and Page&#x27;s guitar riffs. The arrangement had been worked out before recording, and was straightforward to put down on tape.

===Unreleased material===
As &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; collected various out-takes from earlier albums, little was left over from the recording sessions that was not eventually released. An early arrangement of &quot;Custard Pie&quot;, different from the final version, was reworked as &quot;Hots on For Nowhere&quot; on the following album, &quot;Presence&quot;. A number of other outtakes from earlier album sessions that had not been put on &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; were later included on the 1982 album &quot;Coda&quot;.

==Artwork and packaging==

The album was originally released with a die-cut sleeve design depicting a New York City tenement block, through whose windows various cultural icons could be interchangeably viewed. The album designer, Peter Corriston, was looking for a building that was symmetrical with interesting details, that was not obstructed by other objects and would fit the square album cover. He subsequently came up with the rest of the cover based on the idea of people moving in and out of the tenement, with various sleeves that could be placed under the main cover and filling the windows with various pieces of information.

The two five-storey buildings photographed for the album cover are located at 96 and 98 St. Mark&#x27;s Place in New York City. The original photograph underwent a number of tweaks to arrive at the final image. The fourth floor of the building had to be cropped out to fit the square album cover format. (The front doorway and stoop at 96 St. Mark&#x27;s Place is also the location used by the Rolling Stones for the music video promoting their single &quot;Waiting on a Friend&quot;, from their 1981 album &quot;Tattoo You&quot;).

Eschewing the usual gatefold design in favour of a special die-cut cover, the original album jacket included four covers made up of two inners (for each disc), a middle insert cover and an outer cover. The middle insert cover is white and details all the album track listings and recording information. The outer cover has die-cut windows on the building, so when the middle cover is wrapped around the inner covers and slid into the outer cover, the title of the album is shown on the front cover, spelling out the name &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot;. Images in the windows touched upon a set of American icons and a range of Hollywood ephemera. Pictures of W. C. Fields and Buzz Aldrin alternated with the snapshots of Led Zeppelin. Photographs of Lee Harvey Oswald, Marcel Duchamp and Pope Leo XIII are also featured. Per the liner notes, package concept and design was by AGI/Mike Doud (London) and Peter Corriston (New York). Photography was by Elliott Erwitt, B. P. Fallon, and Roy Harper. &quot;Tinting Extraordinaire&quot;: Maurice Tate, and window illustration by Dave Heffernan. In 1976, the album was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of best album package.

==Release and critical reception==

&quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; was Led Zeppelin&#x27;s first release on their own Swan Song Records label, which had been launched in May 1974. Until this point, all of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s albums had been released on Atlantic Records, who would distribute Swan Song. The album was first announced to the press on 6 November with a planned release date of 29 November and an accompanying US tour (the band&#x27;s tenth) starting in January. Delays in the production of the album&#x27;s sleeve design prevented its release prior to the commencement of the tour. It was finally released on 24 February 1975.

The album was a commercial and critical success, having built up a huge advance order following the delayed release date, and when eventually issued it reached No. 1 in the UK charts. In the US, it debuted at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Albums chart, rising to No. 1 the following week and staying there for six weeks. &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; has since proven to be one of the most popular releases by the group, shipping 8 million copies in the United States. It was the first album to go platinum on advance orders alone. Shortly after its release, all previous Led Zeppelin albums simultaneously re-entered the top-200 album chart.

The group debuted several songs from &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; live at a warm-up gig in Rotterdam, Netherlands, on 11 January, a week before the US tour, which lasted until 27 March. The tour was also successful, and was followed up by a series of shows at Earl&#x27;s Court, London. Tickets for the shows sold out within four hours, described by promoter Mel Bush as &quot;unprecedented demand in the history of rock music&quot;, so a further two dates were added. The shows attracted rave reviews, and critics noted the band enjoyed playing the new material on &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; more than the older songs.

&quot;NME&quot;″s Nick Kent reviewed the album three months before it was released. He speculated it could be the group&#x27;s best work to date, saying &quot;the album&#x27;s tonal density is absolutely the toughest, most downright brutal I&#x27;ve heard all year&quot;. In March 1975, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s reviewer wrote: &quot;[&quot;Physical Graffiti&quot;] is a tour de force through a number of musical styles, from straight rock to blues to folky acoustic to orchestral sounds.&quot; Similarly, Jim Miller stated in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that the double album was &quot;the band&#x27;s &quot;Tommy&quot;, &quot;Beggar&#x27;s Banquet&quot; and &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; rolled into one: &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; is Led Zeppelin&#x27;s bid for artistic respectability&quot;. &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau maintained his long-held ambivalence regarding Led Zeppelin, writing that except for side two, the material often wanders into &quot;wide tracks, misconceived opi, and so forth&quot;, and &quot;after a while Robert Plant begins to grate&quot;.

In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it at number 70 on the magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. It was re-ranked at number 73 in a 2012 revised list, and re-ranked at number 144 in 2020.

Plant later felt that &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; represented the band at its creative peak, and has since said that it is his favourite Led Zeppelin album. Page has also said the album was a &quot;high-water mark&quot; for the group, and the creative energy from jamming and gradually working out song structures together led to some strong material. Reviewing the album for BBC Music in 2007, Chris Jones described it as &quot;a towering monument to the glory of Zeppelin in their high-flying heyday&quot;.

==Reissues==

&quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; was first issued on CD as a double-disc set in 1987. However, it was done without input from the band, and the first pressing accidentally edited off the studio banter at the end of &quot;In My Time of Dying&quot; (later fixed on repressings). Page was unhappy with his lack of input over the CDs and decided he would produce new versions himself. He booked a week in May 1990 with engineer George Marino to remaster the entire back catalogue. Eight tracks from &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; appeared on the four-disc &quot;Boxed Set&quot; and three on &quot;Remasters&quot;, both in 1990; the remainder appeared on &quot;Boxed Set 2&quot; in 1993, while the album was properly reissued in 1994.

An extended remastered version of &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; was reissued on 23 February 2015, almost exactly forty years after the original album was released. The reissue comes in six formats: a standard two-CD edition, a deluxe three-CD edition, a standard two-LP version, a deluxe three-LP version, a super deluxe three-CD plus three-LP version with a hardback book, and as high resolution 24-bit/96k digital downloads. The deluxe and super deluxe editions feature bonus material containing alternative takes and arrangements of songs. The reissue was released with an altered colour version of the original album&#x27;s artwork as its bonus disc&#x27;s cover.

<text>Presence is the seventh studio album by the English rock band Led Zeppelin. It was released by the band&#x27;s own label Swan Song Records on 31 March 1976 in the United States and on 2 April 1976 in the United Kingdom. While the record was commercially successful, reaching the top of both the British and American album charts, and achieving a triple-platinum certification in the United States by the RIAA, it received mixed reviews from critics and is the lowest-selling album by the band, but received more positive reviews in years after its release.

The album was written and recorded in the last months of 1975, during a difficult time in the band&#x27;s history. Singer Robert Plant was recovering from serious injuries he had sustained earlier that year in a car accident; this led to tours being cancelled and the band booking studio time to record &quot;Presence&quot; instead. The entire album was completed in a few weeks, with guitarist Jimmy Page putting in several long shifts to complete recording and mixing. The title came from the strong presence the group felt as they worked together. The LP&#x27;s artwork from Hipgnosis featured several photographs focused on a mysterious black object, called &quot;The Object&quot;.

&quot;Presence&quot; is dominated by compositions by Page and Plant, with only one track credited to the entire group; unlike other Zeppelin albums, it features no keyboards and little acoustic guitar. Because Plant was still ill, the band could not tour to promote the release, and only two tracks, including the ten-minute opener &quot;Achilles Last Stand&quot;, were performed live. However, the album has been re-appraised in retrospective reviews for its hard rock dynamics and simplicity compared to the group&#x27;s other work.

==Background==
After touring in support of their previous album, &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot;, released in early 1975, Led Zeppelin took a brief break from touring that summer, intending to start a major US tour on 23 August. Critics had said they were at the height of their popularity at this time. However, singer Robert Plant sustained serious injuries from a car accident on the Greek island of Rhodes on 4 August, which forced the band to cancel the tour and reschedule their activities.

Because of their status as tax exiles, Plant was forced to recuperate abroad, initially in Jersey in the Channel Islands, then in Malibu, California, and wrote several sets of lyrics that reflected on his personal situation and wondering about the future. Guitarist Jimmy Page joined him in Malibu in September and the pair began to think about plans to make an album instead. The two prepared enough material to be able to present to the rest of the band. The other two members, drummer John Bonham and bassist John Paul Jones, joined them at Hollywood&#x27;s SIR Studio where they rehearsed the material throughout October 1975.

==Recording==
Once they had worked out arrangements, the group were eager to record. Page favoured going to Musicland Studios in Munich, Germany, which he felt had state-of-the-art recording facilities. Plant was still recovering from the accident during recording and sang his vocals in a wheelchair, which led to Page assuming most of the responsibilities at the sessions. The album was recorded and mixed with longtime group associate and engineer Keith Harwood, and completed in eighteen days, with the final mixes finished on 27 November. This was the fastest recording turnaround time achieved by the band since their debut album.

The rushed recording sessions were in part a result of Led Zeppelin having booked the studio immediately prior to the Rolling Stones, who were shortly to record songs for their album &quot;Black and Blue&quot; (released, like &quot;Presence&quot;, in the spring of 1976). Page negotiated with the Stones to borrow two days from their recording session time, during which he completed all the guitar overdubs in one lengthy session. Page and Harwood then worked on the mixes virtually non-stop until they fell asleep; whoever woke up first went back to the desk to carry on. Page later stated he worked around 18–20 hours every day during the sessions.

The recording sessions for &quot;Presence&quot; were also particularly challenging for Plant. The studio was in a basement of an old hotel, and the singer felt claustrophobic. He also experienced physical difficulties as a result of his car accident, and missed his family. He later said he was upset about Page and manager Peter Grant booking the &quot;Presence&quot; sessions and began to re-evaluate the priorities in his life.

Because the album was completed one day before the American holiday of Thanksgiving, Plant suggested to the record company the album should be called &quot;Thanksgiving&quot;. This idea was quickly dropped in favour of a title that was thought would represent the powerful force and presence that the band members felt surrounded the group.

==Songs==
Six of the seven songs on the album are Page and Plant compositions; the remaining song, &quot;Royal Orleans&quot;, is credited to all four band members. This is because the majority of the songs were formulated at Malibu, where Page (but not Bonham and Jones) had initially joined a recuperating Plant. With Plant at less than full fitness, Page took responsibility for the album&#x27;s completion, and his playing dominates the album&#x27;s tracks.

Both Page and Plant had planned this album&#x27;s recording session as a return to hard rock, much like their debut album, except at a new level of complexity. It marked a change in the Led Zeppelin sound towards more straightforward, guitar-based jams. Whereas their previous albums up to and including the previous year&#x27;s &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; contain electric hard rock anthems balanced with acoustic ballads and intricate arrangements, &quot;Presence&quot; was seen to include more simplified riffs, and is Led Zeppelin&#x27;s only studio album that features no keyboards, and with the exception of a rhythm track on &quot;Candy Store Rock&quot;, no acoustic guitar. The changed stylistic emphasis on this album was a direct result of the troubled circumstances experienced by the band around the time of its recording. Page later said the music came from this spontaneity. Plant later described it as &quot;a cry of survival&quot; and speculated the group would not make another album like it.

The ten-minute opening song, &quot;Achilles Last Stand&quot;, was first recorded on 12 November, when the basic backing track was laid down. Jones played an Alembic 8 string bass on the track, giving it a distinctive tone. Plant wrote the lyrics based on travelling across Africa in mid-1975 with Page. Page added six guitars in the marathon overdubbing session at the end of the recording period.

&quot;For Your Life&quot; was developed mostly in the studio. For the recording, Page used a Fender Stratocaster, provided by former Byrds guitarist Gene Parsons. &quot;Royal Orleans&quot; was written about an incident involving Jones at the Royal Orleans Hotel in New Orleans and includes a reference to soul singer Barry White. It was the only track on the album credited to the entire band.

&quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fault but Mine&quot;, was inspired by the Blind Willie Johnson song &quot;It&#x27;s Nobody&#x27;s Fault but Mine&quot;, first recorded in 1928 and later covered by Nina Simone in 1969. The influence of the old blues song are noticeable in both Page&#x27;s guitar work in the track, and also in the melody and lyrics. &quot;Candy Store Rock&quot; was inspired by 1950s rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. &quot;Hots on for Nowhere&quot; was written about Plant&#x27;s time in Malibu, while Page played the Stratocaster on the track. The closing number, &quot;Tea For One&quot;, was a slow blues written by Plant about the problems he faced being separated from his family, and was an attempt to update their earlier &quot;Since I&#x27;ve Been Loving You&quot; from &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot;.

In contrast to earlier albums that contained several tracks that the band chose to play live at Led Zeppelin concerts, only two tracks from &quot;Presence&quot; were played in full on stage while the band was active. &quot;Achilles Last Stand&quot; and &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fault but Mine&quot; were added to the setlist for the 1977 tour of the United States and stayed on it through the band&#x27;s final concerts in 1980. &quot;Tea For One&quot; was performed live on the Page and Plant tour of Japan in 1996, where the main group was backed by an orchestra. &quot;For Your Life&quot; was played in full by Led Zeppelin for the first (and only) time at the Ahmet Ertegün Tribute Concert on 10 December 2007.

==Packaging and artwork==
The cover and inside sleeve, created by Hipgnosis with George Hardie, features images of people interacting with a black obelisk-shaped object. Inside the sleeve, the item is referred to simply as &quot;The Object&quot;. It was intended to represent Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;force and presence&quot;. Hipgnosis co-founder Storm Thorgerson wrote that the obelisk represented the power of Led Zeppelin, saying they were &quot;so powerful, they didn&#x27;t need to be there&quot;. Both Page and Plant have said that the presence of the object in the photographs made people stop and think about what is real, which reflected the music.

The background in the cover photograph is an artificial marina, installed in London&#x27;s Earl&#x27;s Court arena for the annual Boat Show, in the winter of 1974–75. The band played a series of concerts at this venue in May 1975, a few months after the boat show. The inner sleeve photographs came from various archive stock pictures, and was designed to resemble a feature in &quot;National Geographic&quot;. The girl on the back cover photo was Samantha Gates, and she had also appeared (with her brother Stefan) on the cover of &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot;. Hipgnosis and Hardie were nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Album Package in 1977.

==Release and reception==
The album was released on 31 March 1976, having been delayed by the completion of the album sleeve. In Britain it attained one of the highest ever advance orders, shipping gold on the day of release. It entered at and peaked the following week at on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Albums chart. However, the album was the lowest selling of their career as it was overshadowed by the release of the band&#x27;s movie and soundtrack &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot;. &quot;Candy Store Rock&quot; was released as a single in the US, but it failed to chart.

In a contemporary review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Stephen Davis said &quot;Presence&quot; established Led Zeppelin as the premier heavy metal act and featured some exceptional rock music, highlighting the &quot;clean and purifying&quot; guitar riffs. In spite of a few dull blues rock songs, the album was &quot;another monster in what by now is a continuing tradition of battles won by this band of survivors&quot;, in Davis&#x27; opinion. Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, citing &quot;Hots on for Nowhere&quot; as a &quot;commanding cut&quot; while finding much of the rest consistent but unnecessary in comparison with earlier recordings.

Neil McCormick of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; claimed it was &quot;Zeppelin at their most blunted&quot;, awarding it two stars out of five. In a retrospective review, a &quot;Q&quot; critic who gave the album three out of five stars wrote, &quot;&quot;Presence&quot; sounds as rushed as it was.&quot;

According to Dave Lewis, &quot;The direct, hard-hitting nature of the seven recordings failed to connect with a fan base more accustomed to the diversity and experimental edge of their previous work. Page later acknowledged that, because the album conveys a sense of urgency resulting from the troubled circumstances in which it was recorded, &quot;it&#x27;s not an easy album for a lot of people to access ... [I]t&#x27;s not an easy album for a lot of people to listen to.&quot; Lewis nonetheless believed that &quot;Presence&quot; was underrated, as its music &quot;packs a considerable punch&quot;, highlighting Page&#x27;s playing and the production on the album. Fellow journalist Mick Wall said it &quot;pulled Led Zeppelin back from the brink of crisis&quot;.

===2015 reissue===

A remastered version of &quot;Presence&quot;, along with &quot;In Through the Out Door&quot; and &quot;Coda&quot; were reissued on 31 July 2015. The reissue comes in six formats, including CD, vinyl and digital download. The deluxe and super deluxe editions feature bonus material containing alternative takes and one previously unreleased instrumental, &quot;10 Ribs &amp; All/Carrot Pod Pod&quot;. The reissue was released with an altered colour version of the original album&#x27;s artwork as the bonus disc&#x27;s cover.

The reissue received generally positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 77, based on eight reviews. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote, &quot;It might be their weakest album, but &quot;Presence&quot; is among the most special; none of these songs sound like they could have come from another record.&quot; &quot;Uncut&quot; said the original album is grand &quot;in lyric form and musical scale&quot;, while &quot;the discs of &#x27;companion audio,&#x27; often short on revelation, here reveal a moment of sheer anomaly. &#x27;10 Ribs &amp; All/Carrot Pod Pod (Pod)&#x27; is whatever that title may mean, everything the LP is not: a tender piano piece.&quot; &quot;PopMatters&quot; was less impressed, saying &quot;like the rest of the re-releases, the bonus material leaves too much to be desired&quot;, but concluded, &quot;despite its weak second half, &quot;Presence&quot; is too good of an album to be dismissed.&quot;

<doc id="50250" wikidata="Q163329" url="?curid=50250" title="Canaan">
<text>Canaan was a Semitic-speaking civilization and region of the Southern Levant in the Ancient Near East during the late 2nd millennium BC. Canaan had significant geopolitical importance in the Late Bronze Age Amarna Period (14th century BC) as the area where the spheres of interest of the Egyptian, Hittite, Mitanni, and Assyrian Empires converged or overlapped. Much of present-day knowledge about Canaan stems from archaeological excavation in this area at sites such as Tel Hazor, Tel Megiddo, En Esur, and Gezer.

The name &quot;Canaan&quot; appears throughout the Bible as a geography associated with the &quot;Promised Land&quot;. The demonym &quot;Canaanites&quot; serves as an ethnic catch-all term covering various indigenous populations—both settled and nomadic-pastoral groups—throughout the regions of the southern Levant. It is by far the most frequently used ethnic term in the Bible. Biblical scholar Mark Smith, citing archaeological findings, suggests &quot;that the Israelite culture largely overlapped with and derived from Canaanite culture ... In short, Israelite culture was largely Canaanite in nature.&quot;

The name &quot;Canaanites&quot; is attested, many centuries later, as the endonym of the people later known to the Ancient Greeks from BC as Phoenicians, and after the emigration of Phoenicians and Canaanite-speakers to Carthage (founded in the 9th century BC), was also used as a self-designation by the Punics (as ) of North Africa during Late Antiquity.

==Etymology==
===Canaan===
The English term &quot;Canaan&quot; (pronounced since , due to the Great Vowel Shift) comes from the Hebrew (), via the Koine Greek and the Latin . It appears as &quot;Kinâḫna&quot; (, &quot;KURki-na-aḫ-na&quot;) in the Amarna letters (14th century BC) and several other ancient Egyptian texts. In Greek, it first occurs in the writings of Hecataeus (c. 550–476 BC) as &quot;&quot; (). It is attested in Phoenician on coins from Berytus dated to the 2nd century BC.

The etymology is uncertain. An early explanation derives the term from the Semitic root , &quot;to be low, humble, subjugated&quot;. Some scholars have suggested that this implies an original meaning of &quot;lowlands&quot;, in contrast with Aram, which would then mean &quot;highlands&quot;, whereas others have suggested it meant &quot;the subjugated&quot; as the name of Egypt&#x27;s province in the Levant, and evolved into the proper name in a similar fashion to Provincia Nostra (the first Roman colony north of the Alps, which became Provence).

An alternative suggestion, put forward by Ephraim Avigdor Speiser in 1936, derives the term from Hurrian , purportedly referring to the colour purple, so that &quot;Canaan&quot; and &quot;Phoenicia&quot; would be synonyms (&quot;Land of Purple&quot;). Tablets found in the Hurrian city of Nuzi in the early 20th century appear to use the term as a synonym for red or purple dye, laboriously produced by the Kassite rulers of Babylon from murex molluscs as early as 1600 BC, and on the Mediterranean coast by the Phoenicians from a byproduct of glassmaking. Purple cloth became a renowned Canaanite export commodity which is mentioned in Exodus. The dyes may have been named after their place of origin. The name &#x27;Phoenicia&#x27; is connected with the Greek word for &quot;purple&quot;, apparently referring to the same product, but it is difficult to state with certainty whether the Greek word came from the name, or vice versa. The purple cloth of Tyre in Phoenicia was well known far and wide and was associated by the Romans with nobility and royalty. However, according to Robert Drews, Speiser&#x27;s proposal has generally been abandoned.

===Djahy===
Retjenu (Anglicised &#x27;Retenu&#x27;) was the usual ancient Egyptian name for Canaan and Syria, covering the region from Gaza in the south, to Tartous in the north. Its borders shifted with time, but it generally consisted of three regions. The region between Ascalon and the Lebanon, stretching inland to the Sea of Galilee, was named Djahy, which was approximately synonymous with Canaan.

==Archaeology and history==
===Overview===
There are several periodization systems for Canaan. One of them is the following.
* Prior to 4500 BC (prehistory – Stone Age): hunter-gatherer societies slowly giving way to farming and herding societies
* 4500–3500 BC (Chalcolithic): early metal-working and farming
* 3500–2000 BC (Early Bronze): prior to written records in the area
* 2000–1550 BC (Middle Bronze): city-states
* 1550–1200 BC (Late Bronze): Egyptian hegemony
* 1200–various dates by region (Iron Age)

After the Iron Age the periods are named after the various empires that ruled the region: Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, Hellenistic (related to Greece) and Roman.

Canaanite culture developed &quot;in situ&quot; from multiple waves of migration merging with the earlier Circum-Arabian Nomadic Pastoral Complex, which in turn developed from a fusion of their ancestral Natufian and Harifian cultures with Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) farming cultures, practicing animal domestication, during the 6200 BC climatic crisis which led to the Neolithic Revolution/First Agricultural Revolution in the Levant. The majority of Canaan is covered by the Eastern Mediterranean conifer–sclerophyllous–broadleaf forests ecoregion.

===Chalcolithic (4500–3500 BC)===

The first wave of migration, called Ghassulian culture, entered Canaan circa 4500 BC. This is the start of the Chalcolithic in Canaan. From their unknown homeland, they brought an already complete craft tradition of metalwork. They were expert coppersmiths; in fact, their work was the most advanced metal technology in the ancient world. Their work is similar to artifacts from the later Maykop culture, leading some scholars to believe they represent two branches of an original metalworking tradition. Their main copper mine was at Wadi Feynan. The copper was mined from the Cambrian Burj Dolomite Shale Unit in the form of the mineral malachite. All of the copper was smelted at sites in Beersheba culture.

Genetic analysis has shown that the Ghassulians belonged to the West Asian haplogroup T-M184.

The end of the Chalcolithic period saw the rise of the urban settlement of &#x27;En Esur on the southern Mediterranean coast.

=== Early Bronze Age (3500–2000 BC) ===

By the Early Bronze Age other sites had developed, such as Ebla (where an East Semitic language, Eblaite, was spoken), which by BC was incorporated into the Mesopotamia-based Akkadian Empire of Sargon the Great and Naram-Sin of Akkad (biblical Accad). Sumerian references to the &quot;Mar.tu&quot; (&quot;tent dwellers&quot;, later &quot;Amurru&quot;, i.e. Amorite) country west of the Euphrates River date from even earlier than Sargon, at least to the reign of the Sumerian king, Enshakushanna of Uruk, and one tablet credits the early Sumerian king Lugal-Anne-Mundu withholding sway in the region, although this tablet is considered less credible because it was produced centuries later.

Amorites at Hazor, Kadesh (Qadesh-on-the-Orontes), and elsewhere in Amurru (Syria) bordered Canaan in the north and northeast. (Ugarit may be included among these Amoritic entities.) The collapse of the Akkadian Empire in 2154 BC saw the arrival of peoples using Khirbet Kerak ware (pottery), coming originally from the Zagros Mountains (in modern Iran) east of the Tigris. In addition, DNA analysis revealed that between 2500 and 1000 BC, populations from the Chalcolithic Zagros and Bronze Age Caucasus migrated to the Southern Levant.

The first cities in the southern Levant arose during this period. The major sites were &#x27;En Esur and Meggido. These &quot;proto-Canaanites&quot; were in regular contact with the other peoples to their south such as Egypt, and to the north Asia Minor (Hurrians, Hattians, Hittites, Luwians) and Mesopotamia (Sumer, Akkad, Assyria), a trend that continued through the Iron Age. The end of the period is marked by the abandonment of the cities and a return to lifestyles based on farming villages and semi-nomadic herding, although specialised craft production continued and trade routes remained open. Archaeologically, the Late Bronze Age state of Ugarit (at Ras Shamra in Syria) is considered quintessentially Canaanite, even though its Ugaritic language does not belong to the Canaanite language group proper.

A disputed reference to a &quot;Lord of &quot;ga-na-na&quot;&quot; in the Semitic Ebla tablets (dated 2350 BC) from the archive of Tell Mardikh has been interpreted by some scholars to mention the deity Dagon by the title &quot;Lord of Canaan&quot; If correct, this would suggest that Eblaites were conscious of Canaan as an entity by 2500 BC. Jonathan Tubb states that the term &quot;ga-na-na&quot; &quot;may provide a third-millennium reference to &quot;Canaanite&quot;&quot;, while at the same time stating that the first certain reference is in the 18th century BC. See Ebla-Biblical controversy for further details.

=== Middle Bronze Age (2000–1550 BC) ===
Urbanism returned and the region was divided among small city-states, the most important of which seems to have been Hazor. Many aspects of Canaanite material culture now reflected a Mesopotamian influence, and the entire region became more tightly integrated into a vast international trading network.

As early as Naram-Sin of Akkad&#x27;s reign ( BC), &quot;Amurru&quot; was called one of the &quot;four quarters&quot; surrounding Akkad, along with Subartu/Assyria, Sumer, and Elam. Amorite dynasties also came to dominate in much of Mesopotamia, including in Larsa, Isin and founding the state of Babylon in 1894 BC. Later on, &quot;Amurru&quot; became the Assyrian/Akkadian term for the interior of south as well as for northerly Canaan. At this time the Canaanite area seemed divided between two confederacies, one centred upon Megiddo in the Jezreel Valley, the second on the more northerly city of Kadesh on the Orontes River. An Amorite chieftain named Sumu-abum founded Babylon as an independent city-state in 1894 BC. One Amorite king of Babylonia, Hammurabi (1792–1750 BC), founded the First Babylonian Empire, which lasted only as long as his lifetime. Upon his death the Amorites were driven from Assyria but remained masters of Babylonia until 1595 BC, when they were ejected by the Hittites.

The semi-fictional &quot;Story of Sinuhe&quot; describes an Egyptian officer, Sinuhe, conducting military activities in the area of &quot;Upper Retjenu&quot; and &quot;Fenekhu&quot; during the reign of Senusret I ( BC). The earliest &quot;bona fide&quot; Egyptian report of a campaign to &quot;Mentu&quot;, &quot;Retjenu&quot; and &quot;Sekmem&quot; (Shechem) is the Sebek-khu Stele, dated to the reign of Senusret III ( BC).

A letter from Mut-bisir to Shamshi-Adad I ( BC) of the Old Assyrian Empire (2025–1750 BC) has been translated: &quot;It is in Rahisum that the brigands (habbatum) and the Canaanites (Kinahnum) are situated&quot;. It was found in 1973 in the ruins of Mari, an Assyrian outpost at that time in Syria. Additional unpublished references to Kinahnum in the Mari letters refer to the same episode. Whether the term Kinahnum refers to people from a specific region or rather people of &quot;foreign origin&quot; has been disputed, such that Robert Drews states that the &quot;first certain cuneiform reference&quot; to Canaan is found on the Alalakh statue of King Idrimi (below).

A reference to Ammiya being &quot;in the land of Canaan&quot; is found on the Statue of Idrimi (16th century BC) from Alalakh in modern Syria. After a popular uprising against his rule, Idrimi was forced into exile with his mother&#x27;s relatives to seek refuge in &quot;the land of Canaan&quot;, where he prepared for an eventual attack to recover his city. The other references in the Alalakh texts are:
* AT 154 (unpublished)
* AT 181: A list of &#x27;Apiru people with their origins. All are towns, except for Canaan
* AT 188: A list of Muskenu people with their origins. All are towns, except for three lands including Canaan
* AT 48: A contract with a Canaanite hunter.

Around 1650 BC, Canaanites invaded the eastern Nile delta, where, known as the Hyksos, they became the dominant power. In Egyptian inscriptions, &quot;Amar&quot; and &quot;Amurru&quot; (Amorites) are applied strictly to the more northerly mountain region east of Phoenicia, extending to the Orontes.
Archaeological excavations of a number of sites, later identified as Canaanite, show that prosperity of the region reached its apogee during this Middle Bronze Age period, under the leadership of the city of Hazor, at least nominally tributary to Egypt for much of the period. In the north, the cities of Yamkhad and Qatna were hegemons of important confederacies, and it would appear that biblical Hazor was the chief city of another important coalition in the south.

=== Late Bronze Age (1550–1200 BC) ===
In the early Late Bronze Age, Canaanite confederacies centered on Megiddo and Kadesh, before being fully brought into the Egyptian Empire and Hittite Empire. Later still, the Neo-Assyrian Empire assimilated the region.

According to the Bible, the migrant ancient Semitic-speaking peoples who appear to have settled in the region included (among others) the Amorites, who had earlier controlled Babylonia. The Hebrew Bible mentions the &quot;Amorites&quot; in the &quot;Table of Peoples&quot; (Book of Genesis 10:16–18a). Evidently, the Amorites played a significant role in the early history of Canaan. In Book of Genesis 14:7 &quot;f&quot;., Book of Joshua 10:5 &quot;f&quot;., Book of Deuteronomy 1:19 &quot;f&quot;., 27, 44, we find them located in the southern mountain country, while verses such as Book of Numbers 21:13, Book of Joshua 9:10, 24:8, 12, etc., tell of two great Amorite kings residing at Heshbon and Ashteroth, east of the Jordan. Other passages, including Book of Genesis 15:16, 48:22, Book of Joshua 24:15, Book of Judges 1:34, regard the name &quot;Amorite&quot; as synonymous with &quot;Canaanite&quot;. The name &quot;Amorite&quot; is, however, never used for the population on the coast.
In the centuries preceding the appearance of the biblical Hebrews, parts of Canaan and southwestern Syria became tributary to the Egyptian pharaohs, although domination by the Egyptians remained sporadic, and not strong enough to prevent frequent local rebellions and inter-city struggles. Other areas such as northern Canaan and northern Syria came to be ruled by the Assyrians during this period.

Under Thutmose III (1479–1426 BC) and Amenhotep II (1427–1400 BC), the regular presence of the strong hand of the Egyptian ruler and his armies kept the Amorites and Canaanites sufficiently loyal. Nevertheless, Thutmose III reported a new and troubling element in the population. Habiru or (in Egyptian) &#x27;Apiru, are reported for the first time. These seem to have been mercenaries, brigands, or outlaws, who may have at one time led a settled life, but with bad luck or due to the force of circumstances, contributed a rootless element to the population, prepared to hire themselves to whichever local mayor, king, or princeling would pay for their support.

Although Habiru (a Sumerian ideogram glossed as &quot;brigand&quot; in Akkadian), and sometimes (an Akkadian word) had been reported in Mesopotamia from the reign of the Sumerian king, Shulgi of Ur III, their appearance in Canaan appears to have been due to the arrival of a new state based in Asia Minor to the north of Assyria and based upon a Maryannu aristocracy of horse-drawn charioteers, associated with the Indo-Aryan rulers of the Hurrians, known as Mitanni.

The Habiru seem to have been more a social class than an ethnic group. One analysis shows that the majority were Hurrian, although there were a number of Semites and even some Kassite and Luwian adventurers amongst their number. The reign of Amenhotep III, as a result, was not quite so tranquil for the Asiatic province, as Habiru/&#x27;Apiru contributed to greater political instability. It is believed that turbulent chiefs began to seek their opportunities, although as a rule they could not find them without the help of a neighbouring king. The boldest of the disaffected nobles was Aziru, son of Abdi-Ashirta, who endeavoured to extend his power into the plain of Damascus. Akizzi, governor of Katna (Qatna?) (near Hamath), reported this to Amenhotep III, who seems to have sought to frustrate Aziru&#x27;s attempts. In the reign of the next pharaoh, Akhenaten (reigned 1352 to 1335 BC) both father and son caused infinite trouble to loyal servants of Egypt like Rib-Hadda, governor of Gubla (Gebal), by transferring their loyalty from the Egyptian crown to the Hittite Empire under Suppiluliuma I (reigned 1344–1322 BC).

Egyptian power in Canaan thus suffered a major setback when the Hittites (or Hatti) advanced into Syria in the reign of Amenhotep III, and when they became even more threatening in that of his successor, displacing the Amorites and prompting a resumption of Semitic migration. Abdi-Ashirta and his son Aziru, at first afraid of the Hittites, afterwards made a treaty with their king, and joining with the Hittites, attacked and conquered the districts remaining loyal to Egypt. In vain did Rib-Hadda send touching appeals for aid to the distant Pharaoh, who was far too engaged in his religious innovations to attend to such messages.

The Amarna letters tell of the Habiri in northern Syria. Etakkama wrote thus to the Pharaoh:

Similarly, Zimrida, king of Sidon (named &#x27;Siduna&#x27;), declared, &quot;All my cities which the king has given into my hand, have come into the hand of the Habiri.&quot; The king of Jerusalem, Abdi-Heba, reported to the Pharaoh:
Abdi-heba&#x27;s principal trouble arose from persons called Iilkili and the sons of Labaya, who are said to have entered into a treasonable league with the Habiri. Apparently this restless warrior found his death at the siege of Gina. All these princes, however, maligned each other in their letters to the Pharaoh, and protested their own innocence of traitorous intentions. Namyawaza, for instance, whom Etakkama (see above) accused of disloyalty, wrote thus to the Pharaoh,

Around the beginning of the New Kingdom period, Egypt exerted rule over much of the Levant. Rule remained strong during the Eighteenth Dynasty, but Egypt&#x27;s rule became precarious during the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties. Ramses II was able to maintain control over it in the stalemated battle against the Hittites at Kadesh in 1275 BC, but soon thereafter, the Hittites successfully took over the northern Levant (Syria and Amurru). Ramses II, obsessed with his own building projects while neglecting Asiatic contacts, allowed control over the region to continue dwindling. During the reign of his successor Merneptah, the Merneptah Stele was issued which claimed to have destroyed various sites in the southern Levant, including a people known as &quot;Israel&quot;. Egypt&#x27;s withdrawal from the southern Levant was a protracted process lasting some one hundred years beginning in the late 13th century BC and ending close to the end of the 12th century BC. The reason for the Egypt&#x27;s withdrawal was most likely political turmoil in Egypt proper rather than the invasion by the Sea Peoples, as there is little evidence that the Sea Peoples caused much destruction ca. 1200 BC. Many Egyptian garrisons or sites with an &quot;Egyptian governor&#x27;s residence&quot; in the southern Levant were abandoned without destruction including Deir al-Balah, Ascalon, Tel Mor, Tell el-Far&#x27;ah (South), Tel Gerisa, Tell Jemmeh, Tel Masos, and Qubur el-Walaydah. Not all Egyptian sites in the southern Levant were abandoned without destruction. The Egyptian garrison at Aphek was destroyed, likely in an act of warfare at the end of the 13th century. The Egyptian gate complex uncovered at Jaffa was destroyed at the end of the 12th century between 1134-1115 based on C14 dates, while Beth-Shean was partially though not completely destroyed, possibly by an earthquake, in the mid-12th century.

==== Amarna letters ====
References to Canaanites are also found throughout the Amarna letters of Pharaoh Akhenaten BC. In these letters, some of which were sent by governors and princes of Canaan to their Egyptian overlord Akhenaten (Amenhotep IV) in the 14th century BC, are found, beside &quot;Amar&quot; and &quot;Amurru&quot; (Amorites), the two forms &quot;Kinahhi&quot; and &quot;Kinahni&quot;, corresponding to &quot;Kena&quot; and &quot;Kena&#x27;an&quot; respectively, and including Syria in its widest extent, as Eduard Meyer has shown. The letters are written in the official and diplomatic East Semitic Akkadian language of Assyria and Babylonia, though &quot;Canaanitish&quot; words and idioms are also in evidence. The known references are:
* EA 8: Letter from Burna-Buriash II to Akhenaten, explaining that his merchants &quot;were detained in Canaan for business matters&quot;, robbed and killed &quot;in Hinnatuna of the land of Canaan&quot; by the rulers of Acre and Shamhuna, and asks for compensation because &quot;Canaan is your country&quot;
* EA 9: Letter from Burna-Buriash II to Tutankhamun, &quot;all the Canaanites wrote to Kurigalzu saying &#x27;come to the border of the country so we can revolt and be allied with you&#x27;&quot;
* EA 30: Letter from Tushratta: &quot;To the kings of Canaan... Provide [my messenger] with safe entry into Egypt&quot;
* EA 109: Letter of Rib-Hadda: &quot;Previously, on seeing a man from Egypt, the kings of Canaan fled before him, but now the sons of Abdi-Ashirta make men from Egypt prowl about like dogs&quot;
* EA 110: Letter of Rib-Hadda: &quot;No ship of the army is to leave Canaan&quot;
* EA 131: Letter of Rib-Hadda: &quot;If he does not send archers, they will take [Byblos] and all the other cities and the lands of Canaan will not belong to the king. May the king ask Yanhamu about these matters.&quot;
* EA 137: Letter of Rib-Hadda: &quot;If the king neglects Byblos, of all the cities of Canaan, not one will be his&quot;
* EA 367: &quot;Hani son (of) Mairēya, &quot;chief of the stable&quot; of the king in Canaan&quot;
* EA 162: Letter to Aziru: &quot;You yourself know that the king does not want to go against all of Canaan when he rages&quot;
* EA 148: Letter from Abimilku to the Pharaoh: &quot;[The king] has taken over the land of the king for the &#x27;Apiru. May the king ask his commissioner, who is familiar with Canaan&quot;
* EA 151: Letter from Abimilku to the Pharaoh: &quot;The king, my lord wrote to me: &#x27;write to me what you have heard from Canaan&#x27;.&quot; Abimilku describes in response what has happened in eastern Cilicia (Danuna), the northern coast of Syria (Ugarit), in Syria (Qadesh, Amurru, and Damascus) as well as in Sidon.

==== Other Late Bronze Age mentions ====
Text RS 20.182 from Ugarit is a copy of a letter of the king of Ugarit to Ramesses II concerning money paid by &quot;the sons of the land of Ugarit&quot; to the &quot;foreman of the sons of the land of Canaan (&quot;*kn&#x27;ny&quot;)&quot; According to Jonathan Tubb, this suggests that the people of Ugarit, contrary to much modern opinion, considered themselves to be non-Canaanite. The other Ugarit reference, KTU 4.96, shows a list of traders assigned to royal estates, one of the estates having three Ugaritans, an Ashdadite, an Egyptian and a Canaanite.

=====Ashur tablets=====
A Middle Assyrian letter during the reign of Shalmaneser I includes a reference to the &quot;travel to Canaan&quot; of an Assyrian official.

=====Hattusa letters=====
Four references are known from Hattusa:
* An evocation to the Cedar Gods: Includes reference to Canaan alongside Sidon, Tyre and possibly Amurru
* KBo XXVIII 1: Ramesses II letter to Hattusili III, in which Ramesses suggested he would meet &quot;his brother&quot; in Canaan and bring him to Egypt
* KUB III 57 (also KUB III 37 + KBo I 17): Broken text which may refer to Canaan as an Egyptian sub-district
* KBo I 15+19: Ramesses II letter to Hattusili III, describing Ramesses&#x27; visit to the &quot;land of Canaan on his way to Kinza and Harita

=== Bronze Age collapse ===
Ann Killebrew has shown that cities such as Jerusalem were large and important walled settlements in the pre-Israelite
Middle Bronze IIB and the Israelite Iron Age IIC period ( and BC), but that during the intervening Late Bronze (LB) and Iron Age I and IIA/B Ages sites like Jerusalem were small and relatively insignificant and unfortified towns.

Just after the Amarna period, a new problem arose which was to trouble the Egyptian control of southern Canaan (the rest of the region then being under Assyrian control). Pharaoh Horemhab campaigned against Shasu (Egyptian = &quot;wanderers&quot;), nomadic pastoralist tribes who had moved across the Jordan River to threaten Egyptian trade through Galilee and Jezreel. Seti I ( BC) is said to have conquered these Shasu, Semitic-speaking nomads living just south and east of the Dead Sea, from the fortress of Taru (Shtir?) to &quot;Ka-n-&#x27;-na&quot;. After the near collapse of the Battle of Kadesh, Rameses II had to campaign vigorously in Canaan to maintain Egyptian power. Egyptian forces penetrated into Moab and Ammon, where a permanent fortress garrison (called simply &quot;Rameses&quot;) was established.

Some believe the &quot;Habiru&quot; signified generally all the nomadic tribes known as &quot;Hebrews&quot;, and particularly the early Israelites of the period of the &quot;judges&quot;, who sought to appropriate the fertile region for themselves. However, the term was rarely used to describe the Shasu. Whether the term may also include other related ancient Semitic-speaking peoples such as the Moabites, Ammonites and Edomites is uncertain.

There is little evidence that any major city or settlement in the southern Levant was destroyed around 1200 BC. At Lachish, The Fosse Temple III was ritually terminated while a house in Area S appears to have burned in a house fire as the most severe evidence of burning was next to two ovens while no other part of the city had evidence of burning. After this though the city was rebuilt in a grander fashion than before. For Megiddo, most parts of the city did not have any signs of damage and it is only possible that the palace in Area AA might have been destroyed though this is not certain. While the monumental structures at Hazor were indeed destroyed, this destruction was in the mid-13th century BC long before the end of the Late Bronze Age began. However, many sites were not burned to the ground around 1200 BC including: Asqaluna, Ashdod (ancient city), Tell es-Safi, Tel Batash, Tel Burna, Tel Dor, Tel Gerisa, Tell Jemmeh, Khirbet Rabud, Tel Zeror, and Tell Abu Hawam among others.

Despite many theories which claim that trade relations broke down after 1200 BC in the southern Levant, there is ample evidence that trade with other regions continued after the end of the Late Bronze Age in the Southern Levant. Archaeologist Jesse Millek has shown that while the common assumption is that trade in Cypriot and Mycenaean pottery ended around 1200 BC, trade in Cypriot pottery actually largely came to an end at 1300, while for Mycenaean pottery, this trade ended at 1250 BC, and destruction around 1200 BC could not have affected either pattern of international trade since it ended before the end of the Late Bronze Age. He has also demonstrated that trade with Egypt continued after 1200 BC. Archaeometallurgical studies performed by various teams have also shown that trade in tin, a non-local metal necessary to make bronze, did not stop or decrease after 1200 BC, even though the closest source of the metal were modern Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, or perhaps even Cornwall, England. Lead from Sardinia was still being imported to the southern Levant after 1200 BC during the early Iron Age.

=== Iron Age ===

By the Early Iron Age, the southern Levant came to be dominated by the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, besides the Philistine city-states on the Mediterranean coast, and the kingdoms of Moab, Ammon, and Aram-Damascus east of the Jordan River, and Edom to the south. The northern Levant was divided into various petty kingdoms, the so-called Syro-Hittite states and the Phoenician city-states.

The entire region (including all Phoenician/Canaanite and Aramean states, together with Israel, Philistia, and Samaria) was conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire during the 10th and 9th centuries BC, and would remain so for three hundred years until the end of the 7th century BC. Emperor-kings such as Ashurnasirpal, Adad-nirari II, Sargon II, Tiglath-Pileser III, Esarhaddon, Sennacherib and Ashurbanipal came to dominate Canaanite affairs. During the Twenty-fifth Dynasty the Egyptians made a failed attempt to regain a foothold in the region but were vanquished by the Neo-Assyrian Empire, leading to an Assyrian conquest of Egypt.

Between 616 and 605 BC the Neo-Assyrian Empire collapsed due to a series of bitter civil wars, followed by an attack by an alliance of Babylonians, Medes, and Persians and the Scythians. The Neo-Babylonian Empire inherited the western part of the empire, including all the lands in Canaan and Syria. They successfully defeated the Egyptians and remained in the region in an attempt to regain a foothold in the Near East.

The Neo-Babylonian Empire itself collapsed in 539 BC, and the region became a part of the Achaemenid Empire. It remained so until in 332 BC it was conquered by the Greeks under Alexander the Great, later to fall to the Roman Empire in the late 2nd century BC, and then Byzantium, until the Arab conquest in the 7th century AD.

=== Egyptian hieroglyphic and hieratic (1500–1000 BC) ===

During the 2nd millennium BC, Ancient Egyptian texts use the term &quot;Canaan&quot; to refer to an Egyptian-ruled colony, whose boundaries generally corroborate the definition of Canaan found in the Hebrew Bible, bounded to the west by the Mediterranean Sea, to the north in the vicinity of Hamath in Syria, to the east by the Jordan Valley, and to the south by a line extended from the Dead Sea to around Gaza. Nevertheless, the Egyptian and Hebrew uses of the term are not identical: the Egyptian texts also identify the coastal city of Qadesh in northwest Syria near Turkey as part of the &quot;Land of Canaan&quot;, so that the Egyptian usage seems to refer to the entire Levantine coast of the Mediterranean Sea, making it a synonym of another Egyptian term for this coastland, Retjenu.

Lebanon, in northern Canaan, bordered by the Litani river to the watershed of the Orontes River, was known by the Egyptians as upper Retjenu. In Egyptian campaign accounts, the term Djahi was used to refer to the watershed of the Jordan river. Many earlier Egyptian sources also mention numerous military campaigns conducted in &quot;Ka-na-na&quot;, just inside Asia.
Archaeological attestation of the name &quot;Canaan&quot; in Ancient Near Eastern sources relates almost exclusively to the period in which the region operated as a colony of the New Kingdom of Egypt (16th–11th centuries BC), with usage of the name almost disappearing following the Late Bronze Age collapse ( BC). The references suggest that during this period the term was familiar to the region&#x27;s neighbors on all sides, although scholars have disputed to what extent such references provide a coherent description of its location and boundaries, and regarding whether the inhabitants used the term to describe themselves.

16 references are known in Egyptian sources, from the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt onwards.
* Amenhotep II inscriptions: Canaanites are included in a list of prisoners of war
* Three topographical lists
* Papyrus Anastasi I 27,1&quot; refers to the route from Sile to Gaza &quot;the [foreign countries] of the end of the land of Canaan&quot;
* Merneptah Stele
* Papyrus Anastasi IIIA 5–6 and Papyrus Anastasi IV 16,4 refer to &quot;Canaanite slaves from Hurru&quot;
* Papyrus Harris After the collapse of the Levant under the so-called &quot;Peoples of the Sea&quot; Ramesses III ( BC) is said to have built a temple to the god Amen to receive tribute from the southern Levant. This was described as being built in &quot;Pa-Canaan&quot;, a geographical reference whose meaning is disputed, with suggestions that it may refer to the city of Gaza or to the entire Egyptian-occupied territory in the southwest corner of the Near East.

=== Greco-Roman historiography ===

The Greek term &quot;Phoenicia&quot; is first attested in the first two works of Western literature, Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;. It does not occur in the Hebrew Bible, but occurs three times in the New Testament in the Book of Acts. In the 6th century BC, Hecataeus of Miletus affirms that Phoenicia was formerly called , a name that Philo of Byblos subsequently adopted into his mythology as his eponym for the Phoenicians: &quot;Khna who was afterwards called Phoinix&quot;. Quoting fragments attributed to Sanchuniathon, he relates that Byblos, Berytus and Tyre were among the first cities ever built, under the rule of the mythical Cronus, and credits the inhabitants with developing fishing, hunting, agriculture, shipbuilding and writing.

Coins of the city of Beirut / Laodicea bear the legend, &quot;Of Laodicea, a metropolis in Canaan&quot;; these coins are dated to the reign of Antiochus IV (175–164 BC) and his successors until 123 BC.

 Saint Augustine also mentions that one of the terms the seafaring Phoenicians called their homeland was &quot;Canaan&quot;. Augustine also records that the rustic people of Hippo in North Africa retained the Punic self-designation &quot;Chanani&quot;. Since &#x27;punic&#x27; in Latin also meant &#x27;non-Roman&#x27;, some scholars, however, argue that the language referred to as Punic in Augustine may have been Libyan.

The Greeks also popularized the term &quot;Palestine&quot;, named after the Philistines or the Aegean Pelasgians, for roughly the region of Canaan, excluding Phoenicia, with Herodotus&#x27; first recorded use of &quot;Palaistinê&quot;, BC. From 110 BC, the Hasmoneans extended their authority over much of the region, creating a Judean-Samaritan-Idumaean-Ituraean-Galilean alliance. The Judean (Jewish, see Ioudaioi) control over the wider area resulted in it also becoming known as Judaea, a term that had previously only referred to the smaller region of the Judean Mountains, the allotment of the Tribe of Judah and heartland of the former Kingdom of Judah. Between 73 and 63 BC, the Roman Republic extended its influence into the region in the Third Mithridatic War, conquering Judea in 63 BC, and splitting the former Hasmonean Kingdom into five districts. Around 130–135 AD, as a result of the suppression of the Bar Kochba revolt, the province of Iudaea was joined with Galilee to form a new province of Syria Palaestina. There is circumstantial evidence linking Hadrian with the name change, although the precise date is not certain, and the interpretation of some scholars that the name change may have been intended &quot;to complete the dissociation with Judaea&quot; is disputed.

=== Later sources ===
Padiiset&#x27;s Statue is the last known Egyptian reference to Canaan, a small statuette labelled &quot;Envoy of the Canaan and of Peleset, Pa-di-Eset, the son of Apy&quot;. The inscription is dated to 900–850 BC, more than 300 years after the preceding known inscription.

During the period BC, the dominant Neo-Assyrian and Achaemenid Empire make no mention of Canaan.

==Canaanites==
The Canaanites were the inhabitants of ancient Canaan, a region that roughly corresponds to present-day Israel and Palestine, western Jordan, southern and coastal Syria, Lebanon, and continued up to the southern border of Turkey. They are believed to have been one of the oldest civilizations in human history.

===History===
The Levant was inhabited by people who referred to the land as &quot;ka-na-na-um&quot; as early as the mid-third millennium BC. The Akkadian word &quot;&quot;kinahhu&quot; referred to the purple-coloured wool, dyed from the Murex molluscs of the coast—which was a key export of the region. When the ancient Greeks later traded with the Canaanites, this meaning of the word seems to have predominated, as they referred to the Canaanites as &quot;Phoenikes&quot; (Φοίνικες; Phoenicians), which may derive from the Greek-language word &quot;phoenix&quot; (φοίνιξ; ), and also described the cloth for which the Greeks traded. The word &quot;phoenix&quot; was transcribed by the Romans to &quot;poenus&quot;&quot;; the descendants of the Canaanite settlers in Carthage were likewise referred to as &quot;Punic&quot;.

Thus, while &quot;Phoenician&quot; and &quot;Canaanite&quot; refer to the same culture, archaeologists and historians commonly refer to the Bronze Age pre-1200 BC Levantine peoples as Canaanites, while their Iron Age descendants, particularly those living on the coast, are referred to as Phoenicians. More recently, the term &quot;Canaanite&quot; has been used for the secondary Iron Age states of the Levantine interior that were not ruled by Aramean peoples, that is, that were ruled by a separate and closely related ethnic group which included the Philistines and the Israelite kingdoms of Israel and Judah.

=== Culture ===
According to archaeologist Jonathan N. Tubb, &quot;Ammonites, Moabites, Israelites, and Phoenicians undoubtedly achieved their own cultural identities, and yet ethnically they were all Canaanites&quot;, &quot;the same people who settled in farming villages in the region in the 8th millennium BC.&quot;

There is uncertainty about whether the name &quot;Canaan&quot; refers to a specific Semitic-speaking ethnic group wherever they live, the homeland of this ethnic group, a region under the control of this ethnic group, or perhaps any combination of the three.

Canaanite civilization was a response to long periods of stable climate interrupted by short periods of climate change. During these periods, Canaanites profited from their intermediary position between the ancient civilizations of the Middle East—Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia (Sumer, Akkad, Assyria, Babylonia), the Hittites, and Minoan Crete—to become city-states of merchant princes along the coast, with small kingdoms specializing in agricultural products in the interior. This polarity, between coastal towns and agrarian hinterland, was illustrated in Canaanite mythology by the struggle between the storm god, variously called Teshub (Hurrian) or Ba&#x27;al Hadad (Semitic Amorite/Aramean) and Ya&#x27;a, Yaw, or Yam, god of the sea and rivers. Early Canaanite civilization was characterized by small walled market towns, surrounded by peasant farmers growing a range of local horticultural products, along with commercial growing of olives, grapes for wine, and pistachios, surrounded by extensive grain cropping, predominantly wheat and barley. Harvest in early summer was a season when transhumance nomadism was practised—shepherds staying with their flocks during the wet season and returning to graze them on the harvested stubble, closer to water supplies in the summer. Evidence of this cycle of agriculture is found in the Gezer calendar and in the biblical cycle of the year.

Periods of rapid climate change generally saw a collapse of this mixed Mediterranean farming system; commercial production was replaced with subsistence agricultural foodstuffs; and transhumance pastoralism became a year-round nomadic pastoral activity, whilst tribal groups wandered in a circular pattern north to the Euphrates, or south to the Egyptian delta with their flocks. Occasionally, tribal chieftains would emerge, raiding enemy settlements and rewarding loyal followers from the spoils or by tariffs levied on merchants. Should the cities band together and retaliate, a neighbouring state intervenes or should the chieftain suffer a reversal of fortune, allies would fall away or intertribal feuding would return. It has been suggested that the Patriarchal tales of the Bible reflect such social forms.

Since 3100 BC, most Canaanites, particularly those that lived on the land that is now Israel/Palestine, lived in walled settlements in the plains and coastal regions. These settlements were surrounded by mud-brick fortifications and agricultural hamlets, which the inhabitants relied on for food. In the 2nd millennium BC, urban Canaanite elites ruled over rural and pastoral areas. The material culture of the city-states was relatively uniform. New burial customs were implicitly influenced by a belief in the afterlife.

During the periods of the collapse of Akkadian Empire in Mesopotamia and the First Intermediate Period of Egypt, the Hyksos invasions and the end of the Middle Bronze Age in Assyria and Babylonia, and the Late Bronze Age collapse, trade through the Canaanite area would dwindle, as Egypt, Babylonia, and to a lesser degree Assyria, withdrew into their isolation. When the climates stabilized, trade would resume firstly along the coast in the area of the Philistine and Phoenician cities. As markets redeveloped, new trade routes that would avoid the heavy tariffs of the coast would develop from Kadesh Barnea, through Hebron, Lachish, Jerusalem, Bethel, Samaria, Shechem, Shiloh through Galilee to Jezreel, Hazor, and Megiddo. Secondary Canaanite cities would develop in this region. Further economic development would see the creation of a third trade route from Eilath, Timna, Edom (Seir), Moab, Ammon, and thence to the Aramean states of Damascus and Palmyra. Earlier states (for example the Philistines and Tyrians in the case of Judah and Samaria, for the second route, and Judah and Israel for the third route) tried generally unsuccessfully to control the interior trade.

Eventually, the prosperity of this trade would attract more powerful regional neighbours, such as Ancient Egypt, Assyria, the Babylonians, Persians, Ancient Greeks, and Romans, who would control the Canaanites politically, levying tribute, taxes, and tariffs. Often in such periods, thorough overgrazing would result in a climatic collapse and a repeat of the cycle (e.g., PPNB, Ghassulian, Uruk, and the Bronze Age cycles already mentioned). The fall of later Canaanite civilization occurred with the incorporation of the area into the Greco-Roman world (as Iudaea province), and after Byzantine times, into the Umayyad Caliphate. Western Aramaic, one of the two lingua francas of Canaanite civilization, is still spoken in a number of small Syrian villages, whilst Phoenician Canaanite disappeared as a spoken language in about 100 CE. A separate Akkadian-infused Eastern Aramaic is still spoken by the existing Assyrians of Iraq, Iran, northeast Syria, and southeast Turkey.

Tel Kabri contains the remains of a Canaanite city from the Middle Bronze Age (2000–1550 BC). The city, the most important of the cities in the Western Galilee during that period, had a palace at its center. Tel Kabri is the only Canaanite city that can be excavated in its entirety because after the city was abandoned, no other city was built over its remains. It is notable because the predominant extra-Canaanite cultural influence is Minoan; Minoan-style frescoes decorate the palace.

=== Genetic studies ===

A 2017 study of five Canaanite skeletons found that approximately half of the skeletons&#x27; genes originated from agricultural settlers in the Levant around 10,000 years ago. The other half was from a population tied to Iran, which researchers estimate arrived in the Levant approximately 5,000 years ago.

Hajjej (2018) revealed that when using HLA genes, Levantine Arabs, such as Palestinians, Syrians, Lebanese and Jordanians, were closely related populations with common Canaanite ancestry. They shared a common geographic territory, which was later disrupted by 19th-century British and French colonization. Their Canaanite ancestors came from North Africa or the Arabian peninsula via Egypt in 3300 BC and settled in the Levant lowlands after the Ghassulian collapse in 3800-3350 BC. The Levantine Arabs were also related to East Mediterranean populations, such as Turks, Greeks and Cretans, Egyptians and Iranians, which can be explained by the high migratory flow between Levantine sub-regions. However, Levantine Arabs were genetically distant from Arabian Peninsula populations such as Saudis, Kuwaitis and Yeminis before the 7th century Islamic conquests.

Agranat-Tamir et al. (2020) stated that Canaanites from the Intermediate Bronze Age (c. 2500–2000 BC) to late Iron Age I (c. 1000 BC) were genetically similar to each other. They lived in modern Israel, Jordan and Lebanon and could be modeled as &quot;a mixture of local earlier Neolithic populations and populations from the northeastern part of the Near East (i.e. Zagros Mountains, Caucasians/Armenians and possibly, Hurrians)&quot;. Exceptions include the 2nd millennium BC inhabitants of Sidon, Abel Beth Maacah and Ashkelon, who were relatively heterogenous due to inflow from the eastern Mediterranean basin. The inhabitants of Ba&#x27;qah in Jordan also have probable admixture from &quot;eastern desert groups&quot;. Following the Bronze Age, there was an addition of European-related and East African-related components, which were represented by Late Neolithic and Bronze Age Europeans and Somalis, from a north-south and south-north gradient respectively. The majority of modern Jewish and Levantine Arabic-speaking groups have 50% or more ancestry from peoples who were related to Bronze Age Levantines and Chalcolithic Zagros groups. This does not mean that any of these present-day groups bear direct ancestry from people who lived in the Middle to Late Bronze Age Levant or in Chalcolithic Zagros; rather, it indicates that they have ancestries from populations whose ancient proxy can be related to the Middle East.

Almarri et al. (2021) stated that Levantines and Arabians diverged from each other before the Neolithic period, with Levantines adopting a sedentary agricultural lifestyle. In the Bronze Age, immigrants with ancient Iranian-related ancestry replaced about 50% of the local Levantine ancestry. They were believed to introduce haplogroup J1, which was not found in earlier Levantines. After the Bronze Age, Eastern Hunter Gatherer (EHG) ancestry was introduced, coinciding with the arrival of peoples with southeast European and Anatolian ancestry. Modern Levantines have significantly higher EHG ancestry than Arabians.

Lazaridis et al. (2022) clarified that ancient Levantines and their descendants exhibit a decrease of ~8% local Neolithic ancestry, which is mostly Natufian, every millennium, starting from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic to the Medieval period. It was largely replaced by Caucasus-related and Anatolian-related ancestries, from the north and west respectively. However, despite the decline in the Natufian component, this key ancestry source made an important contribution to peoples of later periods, continuing until the present.
== In Jewish and Christian scriptures ==
=== Hebrew Bible ===
Canaan and the Canaanites are mentioned some 160 times in the Hebrew Bible, mostly in the Torah and the books of Joshua and Judges.

They descended from Canaan, who was the son of Ham and the grandson of Noah. Canaan was cursed with perpetual slavery because his father Ham had &quot;looked upon&quot; the drunk and naked Noah. The expression &quot;look upon&quot; at times has sexual overtones in the Bible, as in Leviticus 20:11, &quot;The man who lies with his father&#x27;s wife has uncovered his father&#x27;s nakedness...&quot; As a result, interpreters have proposed a variety of possibilities as to what kind of transgression has been committed by Ham, including the possibility of castrating or raping his father or maternal incest. However, some believe that &quot;Canaan&quot; was the perpetrator of the crime, based on the surrounding verses.

According to the Table of Nations, Canaan was also the ancestor of other nations, which were collectively considered to be Canaanite:
Other passages in the Bible offer different lists of the exact names of the Canaanite tribes. For example, lists the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaim, Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites. In contrast, only lists the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite. How those other Biblical lists of Canaanite tribes agree with the genealogical listing of Canaan&#x27;s sons has been subject to much discussion. It has further been argued that the Biblical term Canaanite is actually synecdoche, referring to both the broader Canaanite nation and to a specific Canaanite tribe within that nation.

Modern day scholarship sees the biblical ethnogenesis of Canaan as problematic, because there is archaeological and linguistic evidence that suggests that the ancient Israelites were Canaanites themselves. In particular, they were a subset of Canaanite culture. Alternatively, other scholars have suggested that the Israelites originated from the Shasu and other seminomadic peoples from the desert regions south of the Levant, only later settling in the highlands of Canaan. It has been also suggested that the Hamitic origin myth could be a reference to Canaan&#x27;s colonization by the Egyptians in the Late Bronze Age, who were Hamites according to the Hebrew Bible.

Brian R. Doak argues that &quot;Canaanite&quot; does not necessarily refer to the direct blood descendants of Canaan. Instead, it refers to all ancient peoples that settled in the geographic region of Canaan, including the Israelites. In fact, only five nations overlap in and . In the conquest and Ezra-Nehemiah narratives, &quot;Canaanite&quot; is not necessarily an ethnonym but a descriptor of non-Israelite Canaanites who embody the &quot;symbol(s) of the religious practices Israel should avoid&quot; or all idolaters in Canaan, including Israelites. A similar approach is taken by later Judeo-Christian literature.

In addition, biblical scholar David Frankel argues that a narrative in the Books of Chronicles tenuously indicates the historical reality of Israel&#x27;s ethnogenesis. In this text, a reference is made to an established Israelite presence in Canaan before Joshua&#x27;s conquest, which primarily consisted of Ephraimites.

According to the Hebrew Bible, Canaan was located to the west of the Jordan River. The Canaanites were described as living &quot;by the sea, and along by the side of the Jordan&quot; (Book of Numbers 13:29) and &quot;around Jordan&quot; (Book of Joshua 22:9). More specifically, they inhabited the Mediterranean coastlands (), including Lebanon corresponding to Phoenicia () and the Gaza Strip corresponding to Philistia () and the Jordan Valley (, , ). Numbers 34:3–12 provide even more specific boundaries, which covered territory that was considered to be &quot;small&quot; by ancient standards.

John N. Oswalt observes that &quot;Canaan consists of the land west of the Jordan and is distinguished from the area east of the Jordan.&quot; Oswalt then goes on to say that in Scripture, Canaan &quot;takes on a theological character&quot; as &quot;the land which is God&#x27;s gift&quot; and &quot;the place of abundance&quot;.

Whilst the inhabitants of Canaan are called Canaanites, they are also called Amorites, similar to the citizens of the multi-ethnic Soviet Union being called Russian, and Hethites/Hittites. Abraham, the ancestor of the Israelites, was most likely an Amorite-Aramean, according to some early theories.

====Conquest of Canaan====
Yahweh promises the land of Canaan to Abraham in the Book of Genesis and eventually delivers it to descendants of Abraham, the Israelites. The Hebrew Bible describes the Israelite conquest of Canaan in the &quot;Former Prophets&quot; (, ), viz. the books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings. These books give the narrative of the Israelites after the death of Moses and their entry into Canaan under the leadership of Joshua. The renaming of the Land of Canaan as the Land of Israel marks the Israelite conquest of the Promised Land.

The Canaanites () are said to have been one of seven &quot;nations&quot; driven out by the Israelites following the Exodus. The other nations were the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites (). One of the 613 commandments prescribes that no inhabitants of the cities of six Canaanite nations, the same as mentioned in 7:1, minus the Girgashites, were to be left alive. ().

==== Kingdom of Israel and Judah ====
After the Israelite conquest of Canaan, Canaan existed as a kritarchy and later, a monarchy. Under the Israelite monarchy, the Israelite tribes were united as one kingdom. However, it split into the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah.

In 738 BC, the Neo-Assyrian empire conquered the Kingdom of Israel. In 586 BC, the Kingdom of Judah was annexed into the Neo-Babylonian Empire. The city of Jerusalem fell after a siege which lasted either eighteen or thirty months. By 586 BC, much of Judah was devastated, and the former kingdom suffered a steep decline of both economy and population.

==== Significant figures ====
;Characters in the Hebrew Bible
=== New Testament ===
&quot;Canaan&quot; () is used only twice in the New Testament: both times in Acts of the Apostles when paraphrasing Old Testament stories. Additionally, the derivative (, &quot;Canaanite woman&quot;) is used in Matthew&#x27;s version of the exorcism of the Syrophoenician woman&#x27;s daughter, while the Gospel of Mark uses the term (). It is implied that the New Testament authors considered all non-Jewish inhabitants in the northern coastlines of Canaan to be Canaanite.

In the King James Version of the Bible one of the disciples is known as Simon the Canaanite.

===Uses of the name===
By the Second Temple period (530 BC – 70 AD), &quot;Canaanite&quot; in the Hebrew language had come to be not an ethnic designation, so much as a general synonym for &quot;merchant&quot;, as it is interpreted in, for example, Book of Job 40:30, or Book of Proverbs 31:24.

The name &quot;Canaanites&quot; is attested as the endonym of the people later known to the Ancient Greeks from BC as Phoenicians, and following the emigration of Canaanite-speakers to Carthage (founded in the 9th century BC), was also used as a self-designation by the Punics (&quot;chanani&quot;) of North Africa during Late Antiquity.

The Septuagint (3rd and 2nd century BC) mostly renders Canaan as Χαναάν (Khanaan), but on two occasions as &quot;Phoenicia&quot; (Exod 16:35 and Josh 5:12).

== Legacy ==
&quot;Canaan&quot; is used as a synonym of the Promised Land; for instance, it is used in this sense in the hymn &quot;Canaan&#x27;s Happy Shore&quot;, with the lines: &quot;Oh, brothers, will you meet me, (3x)/On Canaan&#x27;s happy shore,&quot; a hymn set to the tune later used in &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;.

In the 1930s and 1940s, some Revisionist Zionist intellectuals in Mandatory Palestine founded the ideology of Canaanism, which sought to create a unique Hebrew identity, rooted in ancient Canaanite culture, rather than a Jewish one.

Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion observed the contradictions between the secular and biblical records of Jewish indigeneity to Canaan, which was nonetheless affirmed in the Declaration of Independence. Whilst he used secular arguments to justify Jewish indigeneity, he argued that the biblical narrative of Abraham migrating to Canaan was a &quot;reunion with indigenous Hebrews who shared his theological belief&quot;. He also argued that not all Hebrews joined Jacob&#x27;s family when they migrated to Egypt and later, birthed the generation of the Hebrews that endured the Exodus. Some professors find this view tenable, based on , which preserved heterodox traditions of Jewish indigeneity.

<text>Eric Eustace Williams (25 September 1911 – 29 March 1981) was a Trinidad and Tobago politician. He has been described as the &quot;Father of the Nation&quot;, having led the then-British Colony of Trinidad and Tobago to majority rule on 28 October 1956, to independence on 31 August 1962, and republic status on 1 August 1976, leading an unbroken string of general elections victories with his political party, the People&#x27;s National Movement, until his death in 1981. He was the first Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago and also a Caribbean historian, most noted for his book entitled &quot;Capitalism and Slavery.&quot;

==Early life==
Williams was born on 25 September in 1911. His father Thomas Henry Williams was a minor civil servant and devout Roman Catholic, and his mother Eliza Frances Boissiere (13 April 1888 – 1969) was a descendant of the mixed French Creole Mulatto elite and had African and French ancestry. She was a descendant of the notable de Boissière family in Trinidad. Eliza&#x27;s paternal grandfather was John Boissiere, a married upper-middle class Frenchman who had an intimate relationship with an African slave named Ma Zu Zule. From the union, Jules Arnold Boissiere, father of Eliza, was born.

He saw his first school years at Tranquillity Boys&#x27; Intermediate Government School and he was later educated at Queen&#x27;s Royal College in Port of Spain, where he excelled at academics and football. A football injury at QRC led to a hearing problem which he wore a hearing aid to correct.

He won an island scholarship in 1932, which allowed him to attend St. Catherine&#x27;s Society, Oxford (later renamed St. Catherine&#x27;s College). In 1935, he received a first class honours degree, and ranked first among history graduates that year. He also represented the university at football. In 1938, he went on to obtain his doctorate (see section below). In &quot;Inward Hunger&quot;, his autobiography, he described his experience of studying at Oxford, including his frustrations with rampant racial discrimination at the institution, and his travels in Germany after the Nazis&#x27; seizure of power.

==Scholarly career==
In &quot;Inward Hunger&quot;, Williams recounts that in the period following his graduation, He was &quot;severely handicapped in my research by my lack of money... I was turned down everywhere I tried... and could not ignore the racial factor involved&quot;. However, in 1936, thanks to a recommendation made by Sir Alfred Claud Hollis (Governor of Trinidad and Tobago, 1930–36), the Leathersellers&#x27; Company awarded him a £50 grant to continue his advanced research in history at Oxford.

He completed the D.Phil in 1938 under the supervision of Vincent Harlow. His doctoral thesis was titled &quot;The Economic Aspects of the Abolition of the Slave Trade and West Indian Slavery&quot;, and was published as &quot;Capitalism and Slavery&quot; in 1944, although excerpts of his thesis were published in 1939 by &quot;The Keys&quot;, the journal of the League of Coloured Peoples. According to Williams, Fredric Warburg – a publisher of Marxist literature, who Williams asked to publish his thesis – refused to publish, saying that &quot;such a book... would be contrary to the British tradition&quot;. His thesis was both a direct attack on the idea that moral and humanitarian motives were the key facts in the success of the British abolitionist movement, and a covert critique of the established British historiography on the West Indies (as exemplified by, in Williams&#x27; view, the works of Oxford professor Reginald Coupland) as supportive of continued British colonial rule. Williams&#x27;s argument owed much to the influence of C. L. R. James, whose &quot;The Black Jacobins&quot;, also completed in 1938, also offered an economic and geostrategic explanation for the rise of abolitionism in the Western world.

Gad Heuman states:
:In &quot;Capitalism and Slavery,&quot; Eric Williams argued that the declining economies of the British West Indies led to the abolition of the slave trade and of slavery. More recent research has rejected this conclusion; it is now clear that the colonies of the British Caribbean profited considerably during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.

However, &quot;Capitalism and Slavery&quot; covers the economic history of sugar and slavery beyond just the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, and discusses the decline of sugar plantations from 1823 until the emancipation of the slaves in the 1830s. It also discusses the British government&#x27;s use of the equalisation of the sugar duties Acts in the 1840s to sever their responsibilities to buy sugar from the British West Indian colonies, and to buy sugar on the open market from Cuba and Brazil, where it was cheaper. In support of the Williams thesis, David Ryden presented evidence to show that by the early nineteenth century there was an emerging crisis of profitability.

Williams&#x27;s argument about abolitionism went far beyond this decline thesis. What he argued was that the new economic and social interest created in the 18th century by the slave-based Atlantic economy generated new pro-free trade and anti-slavery political interests. These interacted with the rise of evangelical antislavery and with the self-emancipation of slave rebels, from the Haitian Revolution of 1792–1804 to the Jamaica Christmas Rebellion of 1831, to bring the end of Slavery in the 1830s.

In 1939, Williams joined the Political Science department at Howard University. In 1943, Williams organized a conference about the &quot;economic future of the Caribbean.&quot; He argued that small islands of the West Indies would be vulnerable to domination by the former colonial powers in the event that these islands became independent states; Williams advocated for a West Indian Federation as a solution to post-colonial dependence.

==Shift to public life==
In 1944, Williams was appointed to the Anglo-American Caribbean Commission. In 1948 he returned to Trinidad as the Commission&#x27;s deputy chairman of the Caribbean Research Council. In Trinidad, he delivered an acclaimed series of educational lectures. In 1955, after disagreements between Williams and the Commission, the Commission elected not to renew his contract. In a speech at Woodford Square in Port of Spain, he declared that he had decided to &quot;put down his bucket&quot; in the land of his birth. He rechristened that enclosed park, which stood in front of the Trinidad courts and legislature, &quot;The University of Woodford Square&quot;, and proceeded to give a series of public lectures on world history, Greek democracy and philosophy, the history of slavery, and the history of the Caribbean to large audiences drawn from every social class.

===Entry into nationalist politics in Trinidad and Tobago===
From that public platform on 15 January 1956, Williams inaugurated his own political party, the People&#x27;s National Movement (PNM), which would take Trinidad and Tobago into independence in 1962, and dominate its post-colonial politics. Until this time his lectures had been carried out under the auspices of the Political Movement, a branch of the Teachers Education and Cultural Association, a group that had been founded in the 1940s as an alternative to the official teachers&#x27; union. The PNM&#x27;s first document was its constitution. Unlike the other political parties of the time, the PNM was a highly organized, hierarchical body. Its second document was The People&#x27;s Charter, in which the party strove to separate itself from the transitory political assemblages which had thus far been the norm in Trinidadian politics.

In elections held eight months later, on 24 September the Peoples National Movement won 13 of the 24 elected seats in the Legislative Council, defeating 6 of the 16 incumbents running for re-election. Although the PNM did not secure a majority in the 31-member Legislative Council, he was able to convince the Secretary of State for the Colonies to allow him to name the five appointed members of the council (despite the opposition of the Governor, Sir Edward Betham Beetham). This gave him a clear majority in the Legislative Council. Williams was thus elected Chief Minister and was also able to get all seven of his ministers elected.

===Federation and independence===
After the Second World War, the Colonial Office had preferred that British colonies move towards political independence in the kind of federal systems which had appeared to succeed since the Canadian confederation, which created Canada, in the 19th century. In the British West Indies, this goal coincided with the political aims of the nationalist movements which had emerged in all the colonies of the region during the 1930s. The Montego Bay conference of 1948 had declared the common aim to be the achievement by the West Indies of &quot;Dominion Status&quot; (which meant constitutional independence from the British government) as a Federation. In 1958, a West Indies Federation emerged from the British Caribbean, which with British Guiana (now Guyana) and British Honduras (now Belize) choosing to opt out of the Federation, leaving Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago as the dominant players. Most political parties in the various territories aligned themselves into one of two Federal political parties – the West Indies Federal Labour Party (led by Grantley Adams of Barbados and Norman Manley of Jamaica) and the Democratic Labour Party (DLP) led by Manley&#x27;s cousin, Sir Alexander Bustamante. The PNM affiliated with the former, while several opposition parties (the People&#x27;s Democratic Party, the Trinidad Labour Party and the Party of Political Progress Groups) aligned themselves with the DLP, and soon merged to form the Democratic Labour Party of Trinidad and Tobago.

The DLP victory in the 1958 Federal Elections and subsequent poor showing by the PNM in the 1959 County Council Elections soured Williams on the Federation. Lord Hailes (Governor-General of the Federation) also overruled two PNM nominations to the Federal Senate in order to balance a disproportionately WIFLP-dominated Senate. When Bustamante withdrew Jamaica from the Federation, this left Trinidad and Tobago in the untenable position of having to provide 75% of the Federal budget while having less than half the seats in the Federal government. In a speech, Williams declared that &quot;one from ten leaves nought&quot;. Following the adoption of a resolution to that effect by the PNM General Council on 15 January 1962, Williams withdrew Trinidad and Tobago from the West Indies Federation. This action led the British government to dissolve the Federation.

In 1961 the PNM had introduced the &quot;Representation of the People Bill&quot;. This Bill was designed to modernise the electoral system by instituting permanent registration of voters, identification cards, voting machines and revised electoral boundaries. These changes were seen by the DLP as an attempt to disenfranchise illiterate rural voters through intimidation, to rig the elections through the use of voting machines, to allow Afro-Caribbean immigrants from other islands to vote, and to gerrymander the boundaries to ensure victory by the PNM. Opponents of the PNM saw &quot;proof&quot; of these allegations when A. N. R. Robinson was declared winner of the Tobago seat in 1961 with more votes than there were registered voters, and in the fact that the PNM was able to win every subsequent election until the 1980 Tobago House of Assembly Elections.

The 1961 elections gave the PNM 57% of the votes and 20 of the 30 seats. This two-thirds majority allowed them to draft the Independence Constitution without input from the DLP. Although supported by the Colonial Office, independence was blocked by the DLP, until Williams was able to make a deal with DLP leader Rudranath Capildeo that strengthened the rights of the minority party and expanded the number of Opposition Senators. With Capildeo&#x27;s assent, Trinidad and Tobago became independent on 31 August 1962, 25 days after Jamaica. In addition to primeministership, Williams was also Minister of Finance from 1957 to 1961 and from 1966 to 1971.

==Black Power==

Between 1968 and 1970 the Black Power movement gained strength in Trinidad and Tobago. The leadership of the movement developed within the Guild of Undergraduates at the St. Augustine Campus of the University of the West Indies. Led by Geddes Granger, the National Joint Action Committee joined up with trade unionists led by George Weekes of the Oilfields Workers&#x27; Trade Union and Basdeo Panday, then a young trade-union lawyer and activist. The Black Power Revolution started during the 1970 Carnival. In response to the challenge, Williams countered with a broadcast entitled &quot;I am for Black Power&quot;. He introduced a 5% levy to fund unemployment reduction and established the first locally owned commercial bank. However, this intervention had little impact on the protests.

On 3 April 1970, a protester was killed by the police. This was followed on 13 April by the resignation of A. N. R. Robinson, Member of Parliament for Tobago East. On 18 April sugar workers went on strike, and there was the talk of a general strike. In response to this, Williams proclaimed a State of Emergency on 21 April and arrested 15 Black Power leaders. In response to this, a portion of the Trinidad and Tobago Defence Force, led by Raffique Shah and Rex Lassalle, mutinied and took hostages at the army barracks at Teteron. Through the action of the Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard the mutiny was contained and the mutineers surrendered on 25 April.

Williams made three additional speeches in which he sought to identify himself with the aims of the Black Power movement. He reshuffled his cabinet and removed three ministers (including two White members) and three senators. He also proposed a Public Order Bill which would have curtailed civil liberties in an effort to control protest marches. After public opposition, led by A. N. R. Robinson and his newly created Action Committee of Democratic Citizens (which later became the Democratic Action Congress), the Bill was withdrawn. Attorney General Karl Hudson-Phillips offered to resign over the failure of the Bill, but Williams refused his resignation.
==Death==
Prime Minister Eric Eustace Williams of Trinidad and Tobago, died on 29 March 1981 due to throat cancer at his official house in St. Ann&#x27;s, Port of Spain in Trinidad and Tobago. He was 69 years old at the time of his death.

==Personal life==
Eric Williams had married Elsie Ribeiro, a music studies student born to a mother from Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and a Portuguese Trinidadian father, on 30 January 1937, while he was a postgraduate student at Oxford University. He had known Ribeiro from Trinidad before he left for the United Kingdom and she was the sister of his roommate in England. The ceremony was private out of fear that the terms of his scholarship could have prohibited marriage and he did not want it to be terminated. After he graduated, they moved to Washington, D.C. in the United States where he obtained a position at Howard University. They had a son, Alistair Williams, in 1943 and a daughter, Elsie Pamela Williams, in 1947. However, Williams questioned the paternity of Elsie Pamela, thus leading to problems in the marriage. In May 1948, Williams left Washington, D.C. to go back to Trinidad, abandoning his wife and children. His reason for not financially supporting them after leaving was because Ribeiro refused to send their children to Oxford University in the future.

After returning to Trinidad in 1948, he met Evelyn Siulan Soy Moyou, a typist 13 years his junior of Chinese descent on her father&#x27;s side and Chinese, African, and Portuguese descent on her mother&#x27;s side, and she was a niece of Solomon Hochoy, the future Governor and Governor-General of Trinidad and Tobago during Williams&#x27;s premiership. She worked at the Caribbean Commission where Williams had taken up a position. They began a relationship and he initiated divorce proceedings from Ribeiro in January 1950 on a Caribbean Commission trip to the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Ribeiro responded with an injunction restraining him from proceeding with his petition. After dropping the proceedings, in a letter of April 1950 submitted to the jurisdiction of the District of Columbia court, he agreed to abide by its decision and be bound by an order regarding alimony. However, a few months later while on a research holiday in the United States he reinitiated divorce proceedings in Reno, Nevada, known for its quick divorces, due to the fact that Moyou was pregnant with his child. However, Ribeiro obtained an injunction preventing Williams from making any attempt at divorce, on the grounds that he had earlier subjected himself to the jurisdiction of the District of Columbia court. Williams filed formal proceedings for a divorce on 24 November 1950. On 13 December 1950, Williams was ordered to appear in court, most likely because he had filed for a divorce in Reno, even though he had earlier submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the District of Columbia. Even though a lawyer had been assigned to him, he did not appear and on 22 December 1950 he was ordered to be taken into custody by a US Marshal. His lawyer in Reno pointed out that his divorce had been granted, though a search of the court records showed no entry for a final decree. Williams eventually met the six-week residential requirement to obtain a Nevada divorce and on 2 January 1951, he married Moyou in Reno, in a ceremony performed by The Rev. Munroe Warner of First Christian Church. Their daughter, Erica Williams, was born on 12 February 1951, in Reno. After his second marriage, Ribeiro obtained a divorce from him on 20 January 1951, on grounds of desertion. It was made effective on 21 July 1951 and he was ordered to pay a monthly alimony of US$250 for the maintenance of his first wife and two children. On 26 May 1953, Mayou died from Tuberculosis.

He later married Mayleen Mook Sang, his daughter&#x27;s dentist. She was of Chinese Guyanese origin. They were married on Caledonia Island on 13 November 1957 by Rev. Andrew McKean, of Greyfriars Presbyterian Church on Frederick Street in Port of Spain. However, the couple never lived together and the marriage was kept hidden by Williams. The marriage was exposed 18 months later when Mook Sang sent a copy of their marriage certificate to the &quot;Chronicle&quot; newspaper following rumors of Williams having an affair with a local beauty queen. They remained married till his death. After his death she filed to receive Williams&#x27; benefits and pension from his premiership, however it was given to his daughter, Erica, who was named his heir in his will.

===Academic contributions===
Williams specialised in the study of slavery. Many Western academics focused on his chapter on the abolition of the slave trade, but that is just a small part of his work. In his 1944 book, &quot;Capitalism and Slavery&quot;, Williams argued that the British government&#x27;s passage of the Slave Trade Act in 1807 was motivated primarily by economic concerns rather than by humanitarian ones. Williams also argued that by extension, so was the emancipation of the slaves and the blockade of Africa, and that as industrial capitalism and wage labour began to expand, eliminating the competition from wage-free slavery became economically advantageous.

Williams&#x27; impact on that field of study has proved of lasting significance. As Barbara Solow and Stanley Engerman put it in the preface to a compilation of essays on Williams that was based on a commemorative symposium held in Italy in 1984, Williams &quot;defined the study of Caribbean history, and its writing affected the course of Caribbean history... Scholars may disagree on his ideas, but they remain the starting point of discussion... Any conference on British capitalism and Caribbean slavery is a conference on Eric Williams.&quot;

In an open letter to Solow, Yale Professor of History David Brion Davis refers to Williams&#x27; thesis of the declining economic viability of slave labor as &quot;undermined by a vast mountain of empirical evidence and has been repudiated by the world’s leading authorities on New World slavery, the transatlantic slave trade, and the British abolition movement&quot;. A major work which was written to refute Eric Williams&#x27; thesis was Seymour Drescher&#x27;s &quot;Econocide&quot;, which argued that when the slave trade was abolished in 1807, Britain&#x27;s sugar economy was thriving. However, other historians have noted that Drescher ended his study of the economic history of the British West Indies in 1822, and did not address the decline of the British sugar industry (something which was highlighted by Williams) which began in the mid-1820s, and continued until the passage of the Slavery Abolition Act in 1833. The majority of Eric William&#x27;s thesis, which addressed the decline of the sugar industry in the 1820s, the passage of the Slavery Abolition Act in 1833, and the sugar equalisation acts of the 1840s, has continued to influence the historiography of the 19th-century West Indies and it&#x27;s connection to the wider Atlantic world as a whole.

In addition to &quot;Capitalism and Slavery&quot;, Williams produced a number of other scholarly works focused on the Caribbean. Of particular significance are two published long after he had abandoned his academic career for public life: &quot;British Historians and the West Indies&quot; and &quot;From Columbus to Castro&quot;. The former, based on research done in the 1940s and initially presented at a symposium at Clark Atlanta University, sought to challenge established British historiography on the West Indies. Williams was particularly scathing in his criticism of the work of Scottish historian Thomas Carlyle. The latter work is a general history of the Caribbean from the 15th to the mid-20th centuries. The work appeared at the same time as a similarly titled book (&quot;De Cristóbal Colón a Fidel Castro&quot;) by another Caribbean scholar-statesman, Juan Bosch of the Dominican Republic.

Williams sent one of 73 Apollo 11 Goodwill Messages to NASA for the historic first lunar landing in 1969. The message still rests on the lunar surface today. He wrote, in part: &quot;It is our earnest hope for mankind that while we gain the moon, we shall not lose the world.&quot;

===The Eric Williams Memorial Collection===

The Eric Williams Memorial Collection (EWMC) at the University of the West Indies in Trinidad and Tobago was inaugurated in 1998 by former US Secretary of State Colin Powell. In 1999, it was named to UNESCO&#x27;s prestigious Memory of the World Register. Secretary Powell heralded Williams as a tireless warrior in the battle against colonialism, and for his many other achievements as a scholar, politician and international statesman.

The Collection consists of the late Dr. Williams&#x27; Library and Archives. Available for consultation by researchers, the Collection amply reflects its owner&#x27;s eclectic interests, comprising some 7,000 volumes, as well as correspondence, speeches, manuscripts, historical writings, research notes, conference documents and a miscellany of reports. The Museum contains a wealth of emotive memorabilia of the period and copies of the seven translations of Williams&#x27; major work, &quot;Capitalism and Slavery&quot; (into Russian, Chinese and Japanese [1968, 2004] among them, and a Korean translation was released in 2006). Photographs depicting various aspects of his life and contribution to the development of Trinidad and Tobago complete this extraordinarily rich archive, as does a three-dimensional re-creation of Williams&#x27; study.

Dr Colin Palmer, Dodge Professor of History at Princeton University, has said: &quot;as a model for similar archival collections in the Caribbean...I remain very impressed by its breadth... [It] is a national treasure.&quot; Palmer&#x27;s biography of Williams up to 1970, &quot;Eric Williams and the Making of the Modern Caribbean&quot; (University of North Carolina Press, 2008), is dedicated to the Collection.

===Film===
In 2011, to mark the centenary of Williams&#x27; birth, Mariel Brown directed the documentary film &quot;Inward Hunger: the Story of Eric Williams&quot;, scripted by Alake Pilgrim.

<text>The Canadian Alliance (), formally the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance (), was a centre-right to right-wing federal political party in Canada that existed under that name from 2000 to 2003. The Canadian Alliance was the new name of the Reform Party of Canada and inherited many of its populist policies, as well as its position as the Official Opposition in the House of Commons of Canada. The party supported policies that were both fiscally and socially conservative, seeking reduced government spending on social programs and reductions in taxation.

The Alliance resulted from the United Alternative initiative launched by the Reform Party of Canada and several provincial Tory parties as a vehicle to merge with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. The federal Progressive Conservative Party led by Joe Clark in the late fall of 1998 rejected the initiative to &quot;unite the right.&quot; After the Alliance led by Stockwell Day was defeated and a third consecutive Liberal majority government was won in the 2000 federal election, talks reopened and in December 2003, the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservative parties finally voted to merge into the Conservative Party of Canada.

== History ==

=== Background ===
The Canadian Alliance&#x27;s origins were in the Reform Party of Canada, which was founded in 1987 as a right-wing populist party supporting Western Canadian interests. Led by its founder Preston Manning, the Reform Party rapidly gained momentum at the expense of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada (PC); in the 1993 federal election, the PCs fell to only two seats while Reform surged to 52 seats, thus becoming Canada&#x27;s largest right-wing party. However, the party was virtually nonexistent east of Manitoba. In the 1997 election, the PCs rebounded slightly to 20 seats while Reform again struggled outside of the west. The division among the right encouraged Manning to promote a new movement, the &quot;United Alternative&quot; (UA), to create a small-c conservative alternative to the Liberals. Manning blamed &quot;conservative&quot; vote-splitting for keeping the Liberal Party in power, although some polls showed that the Liberals were the second choice of many PC voters (especially in Ontario). Manning&#x27;s efforts created a strong debate in the Reform Party, and he would even write a letter to the effect that he didn&#x27;t want to lead Reform anymore, but would only lead the new party. The opposition died down after Manning won a leadership review with 74.6 per cent support at the January 2000 UA convention.

=== Foundation ===
In 2000, following the second of the two United Alternative conventions, the party voted to form a new party, the &quot;Canadian Conservative Reform Alliance&quot;. After the convention, the Reform Party applied to change its name, short name, and logo; this application was granted by the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada, retroactive to March 27, 2000. As of that date, what used to be the Reform Party of Canada was used as a vehicle to adopt the new name, and re-registered as the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance. The newly named party&#x27;s platform was a mixture of the PC and Reform platforms. However, former Reform members dominated the new party — with few exceptions, the Reform caucus in the Commons essentially became the Alliance caucus. Brian Mulroney called the party &quot;Reform in pantyhose&quot;, and some opponents referred to the party as the &quot;Reform Alliance&quot; to enforce this perception.

Media covering the convention quickly pointed out that if one added the word &quot;Party&quot; to the end of the party&#x27;s name, the resulting initials were &quot;CCRAP&quot; (humorously pronounced &quot;see-&quot; or just &quot;crap&quot;) even though it didn&#x27;t actually have the word &quot;party&quot; in its name. One day later, the party changed its official name to the &quot;Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance&quot;. However, it was almost always called simply &quot;the Canadian Alliance&quot; (which was accepted on first reference in most media outlets) or &quot;the Alliance&quot;. However, the &quot;CCRAP&quot; nickname was still used by its opponents. Deborah Grey, the deputy leader of Reform, was chosen as the new party&#x27;s interim leader, becoming the first female leader of the Opposition in Canadian history. Subsequently, at the new party&#x27;s first leadership convention, Manning was defeated by Stockwell Day, treasurer (finance minister) of Alberta. One Progressive Conservative senator, Gerry St. Germain, joined the new party in October 2000, becoming the Alliance&#x27;s first (and, ultimately, only) member of the Senate.

=== 2000 federal election ===

In the fall of 2000, the Liberals called a snap election that caught the Alliance off-guard. Nonetheless, the party went into the election with great hopes, campaigning on tax cuts, an end to the federal gun registration program, and their vision of &quot;family values&quot;. Day was expected to have greater appeal to Ontario voters. At one point, the Alliance was at 30.5 per cent in the polls; some thought they could win the election, or at least knock the Liberals down to a minority government. However, the Liberals responded by accusing the Alliance of having a &quot;hidden agenda&quot; (e.g., to introduce two-tier health care, and threatening gay rights and abortion rights), which the party denied.

Though disappointed with the election results in Ontario, the Alliance increased its presence to 66 MPs, including two MPs from Ontario. Nationally, the party increased its popular vote to 25 per cent. The Alliance remained the Official Opposition in the House of Commons. The Liberals increased their large majority mostly at the expense of the NDP, and the Tories under Joe Clark lost many seats and remained in fifth place, but Clark was elected in Calgary Centre in the middle of Alliance country, so the overall political landscape was not significantly changed. Like Reform, the Alliance was perceived mostly as a Western protest party.

=== Election aftermath ===
However, the Alliance&#x27;s failure to win more seats east of Manitoba, along with residual resentments from the Alliance leadership contest and questions about Day&#x27;s competence, led to caucus infighting. In the spring of 2001, eleven MPs who either voluntarily resigned or were expelled from the party formed the &quot;Independent Alliance Caucus&quot;. The group was led by Chuck Strahl and included Grey. Day offered the dissidents an amnesty at the end of the summer, but seven of them, including Grey and Strahl, turned it down and formed their own parliamentary grouping, the Democratic Representative Caucus. The DRC formed a coalition with Clark&#x27;s Tories in the House, which was widely seen as an attempt by Clark to reunite the Canadian right on his terms. The split forced Day to call a new leadership convention, and, in April 2002, former Reform MP Stephen Harper defeated Day at the subsequent leadership election.

Once Harper assumed the leadership, most of the rebellious MPs rejoined the Alliance. Two MPs did not rejoin, however: Inky Mark chose to remain outside of caucus, and eventually joined the Tories, and the scandal-plagued Jim Pankiw was rejected when he applied for readmission to the Alliance caucus.

=== Creation of the Conservative Party of Canada ===
On October 15, 2003, the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservative Party (under its new leader Peter MacKay) announced that they would merge to form a new party, called the Conservative Party of Canada. The union was ratified on December 5, 2003, with 96 per cent support of the membership of the Canadian Alliance, and on December 6, 90.04 per cent support of elected delegates in the PC Party. On December 8, the party was registered with Elections Canada, and on March 20, 2004, former Alliance leader Stephen Harper was elected as leader of the party with MacKay serving as deputy leader. The new party was dubbed &quot;the Alliance Conservatives&quot; by critics who considered the new party a &quot;hostile takeover&quot; of the old Progressive Conservatives by the newer Alliance. However, some grassroots Alliance supporters who had adhered to the old populist ideas of the Reform Party feared that the merger would signal a return to what they saw as indifference to Western Canadian interests. The Alliance also subsequently shed some of its populist and socially conservative policies during the merger.

The new Conservative Party formed the Canadian government on February 6, 2006, and won two additional elections (2008 and 2011) under the leadership of Stephen Harper; of these, the 2006 and 2008 votes resulted in the party governing only as a minority; only in 2011 was a majority mandate achieved. The party was defeated in 2015, by the Liberals, and became the official opposition party in the House of Commons.

==Provincial wings==
During its short history, the Canadian Alliance never seriously entertained the prospect of forming provincial wings or forging formal links with existing provincial parties. The vast majority of Alliance supporters in most provinces supported, and continued to support, their provincial Progressive Conservative parties, while most supporters in Saskatchewan remained loyal to the Saskatchewan Party and in BC supported the conservative BC Liberals.

However, an attempt to form a provincial party with clear, if unofficial links with the Alliance was made in Alberta, where the Alberta Alliance was formed in 2002. Under the leadership of Reform/Alliance activist Randy Thorsteinson, the new party never sought a formal link with the Alliance, and if it had done so the overture would likely have been rebuffed since many Albertan Alliance members continued to support the Alberta Progressive Conservatives. However, the Alberta Alliance copied the colours of the Alliance and many of its logos bear a striking resemblance to those of the federal party. The Alberta Alliance continued to grow following the federal party&#x27;s merger, and the provincial party fielded a full slate of candidates for the 2004 provincial election, on November 22, 2004, and won one seat in the Legislature.

<text>Steal This Book is a book written by Abbie Hoffman. Written in 1970 and published the following year, it exemplifies the counterculture of the 1960s. The book sold more than a quarter of a million copies between April and November 1971. The number of copies that were stolen is unknown.

The book is, in the style of the counterculture, mainly focused on ways to fight against the government and against corporations in any way possible. The book is written in the form of a guide to the youth. Hoffman, a political and social activist himself, used many of his own activities as the inspiration for some of his advice in &quot;Steal This Book&quot;.

==Creation==
The main author of the book, Abbie Hoffman, was one of the most influential and recognizable North American activists of the late 1960s and early 1970s, gaining fame with his leadership in anti-Vietnam War protests. In the introduction, Hoffman writes that 50 people were involved in the creation of &quot;Steal This Book&quot;. Izak Haber and Bert Cohen are credited on the title page as &quot;co-conspirator&quot; and &quot;accessory after the fact&quot;, respectively. &quot;Steal This Book&quot; was written in the climate of the counterculture, in which opposition to tradition and government was rampant, and experimentation with new forms of living was encouraged. When the book was published, it took hold among the new left, especially among students on college campuses, such as Brandeis University, where Hoffman had been a student.

&quot;Steal This Book&quot; is divided into three sections, &quot;Survive!&quot;, &quot;Fight!&quot; and &quot;Liberate!&quot;. There is also an introduction and appendix that lists &quot;approved&quot; organizations and other books worth stealing.

&quot;Survive!&quot; gives information and methods for obtaining goods and services for free or at discounted rates. It covers a broad range of items, including food, clothing, furniture, transportation, land, livestock, housing, education, medical care, communication, entertainment, money, and drugs. There is further advice on slug coins, panhandling, welfare, shoplifting, growing cannabis, and establishing a commune.

&quot;Fight!&quot; includes chapters on starting an underground press, broadcasting through guerrilla radio or guerrilla television, non-violent demonstrations and how to protect oneself if they become violent, how to make an assortment of home-made bombs, first aid for street fighters, legal advice, how to seek political asylum, guerrilla warfare, gun laws, and identification papers.

The final section, &quot;Liberate!&quot;, contains information particular to four major cities: New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.

Hoffman has an idiosyncratic writing style, and incorporates slang specific to his subculture—e.g., referring to his country as &quot;.&quot; In the book, Hoffman calls America the &quot;Pig Empire&quot; and contends that it is not immoral to steal from it—in fact, Hoffman wrote, it is immoral &quot;not&quot; to do so. The term was picked up by the Yippies, and was widely used by what became known as the &quot;Woodstock Nation.&quot; Some of the information in the book has since become obsolete for technological or regulatory reasons, but the book iconically reflects the hippie zeitgeist.

==Publication and reception==
&quot;Steal This Book&quot; was rejected by at least 30 publishers before it was able to get into print, and Hoffman was eventually forced to make a publishing company of his own, Pirate Editions, to publish the book at his own expense, with Grove Press as the distributor. Some of the publishers rejected the book out of moral opposition to its content, while others were afraid of the government. Some editors feared a negative reaction from booksellers, to the title as well as the content. This fear proved to be well-founded; in the United States, many regional distributors and bookstores were unwilling to carry the book. In Canada, it was banned by the government.

Once it got into print, &quot;Steal This Book&quot; had many readers and became a bestseller mainly through word of mouth. Dotson Rader in &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as a &quot;necessary&quot; work &quot;of warning and practical knowledge&quot; that had been written with &quot;gentleness and affection.&quot; He wrote that the book had received no reviews and that only one paper had permitted an advertisement, though the book had sold 100,000 copies. Rader felt that the &quot;remarkable&quot; suppression of the book constituted a form of &quot;fearsome censorship.&quot; Hoffman was quoted saying, &quot;It&#x27;s embarrassing when you try to overthrow the government and you wind up on the Best Seller&#x27;s List.&quot;

Subsequent to publication, two contributors to the book, Tom Forcade and Izak Haber, had a dispute with Hoffman. Forcade accused him of failing to pay sufficient royalties, contravening the contract Hoffman had made. Hoffman responded that Forcade had done an &quot;inadequate job&quot; of editing the book. Haber threatened to sue Hoffman for breaking his contract; he claimed that he was due 22 percent of the royalties for having compiled and written the book, but received only $1,000.

<doc id="50263" wikidata="Q192439" url="?curid=50263" title="Domain of a function">
<text>In mathematics, the domain of a function is the set of inputs accepted by the function. It is sometimes denoted by formula_1 or formula_2, where is the function. In layman&#x27;s terms, the domain of a function can generally be thought of as &quot;what x can be&quot;.

More precisely, given a function formula_3, the domain of is . In modern mathematical language, the domain is part of the definition of a function rather than a property of it.

In the special case that and are both sets of real numbers, the function can be graphed in the Cartesian coordinate system. In this case, the domain is represented on the -axis of the graph, as the projection of the graph of the function onto the -axis.

For a function formula_3, the set is called the &quot;codomain&quot;: the set to which all outputs must belong. The set of specific outputs the function assigns to elements of is called its &quot;range&quot; or &quot;image&quot;. The image of f is a subset of , shown as the yellow oval in the accompanying diagram.

Any function can be restricted to a subset of its domain. The restriction of formula_5 to formula_6, where formula_7, is written as formula_8.

== Natural domain ==
If a real function is given by a formula, it may be not defined for some values of the variable. In this case, it is a &quot;partial function&quot;, and the set of real numbers on which the formula can be evaluated to a real number is called the &quot;natural domain&quot; or &quot;domain of definition&quot; of . In many contexts, a partial function is called simply a &quot;function&quot;, and its natural domain is called simply its &quot;domain&quot;.

=== Examples ===

* The function formula_9 defined by formula_10 cannot be evaluated at 0. Therefore, the natural domain of formula_9 is the set of real numbers excluding 0, which can be denoted by formula_12 or formula_13.
* The piecewise function formula_9 defined by formula_15 has as its natural domain the set formula_16 of real numbers.
* The square root function formula_17 has as its natural domain the set of non-negative real numbers, which can be denoted by formula_18, the interval formula_19, or formula_20.
* The tangent function, denoted formula_21, has as its natural domain the set of all real numbers which are not of the form formula_22 for some integer formula_23, which can be written as formula_24.

== Other uses ==

The term &quot;domain&quot; is also commonly used in a different sense in mathematical analysis: a &quot;domain&quot; is a non-empty connected open set in a topological space. In particular, in real and complex analysis, a &quot;domain&quot; is a non-empty connected open subset of the real coordinate space formula_25 or the complex coordinate space formula_26

Sometimes such a domain is used as the domain of a function, although functions may be defined on more general sets. The two concepts are sometimes conflated as in, for example, the study of partial differential equations: in that case, a &quot;domain&quot; is the open connected subset of formula_27 where a problem is posed, making it both an analysis-style domain and also the domain of the unknown function(s) sought.

== Set theoretical notions ==
For example, it is sometimes convenient in set theory to permit the domain of a function to be a proper class , in which case there is formally no such thing as a triple . With such a definition, functions do not have a domain, although some authors still use it informally after introducing a function in the form .

<doc id="50264" wikidata="Q199006" url="?curid=50264" title="Codomain">
<text>In mathematics, a codomain or set of destination of a function is a set into which all of the output of the function is constrained to fall. It is the set in the notation . The term range is sometimes ambiguously used to refer to either the codomain or the &quot;image&quot; of a function.

A codomain is part of a function if is defined as a triple where is called the &quot;domain&quot; of , its &quot;codomain&quot;, and its &quot;graph&quot;. The set of all elements of the form , where ranges over the elements of the domain , is called the &quot;image&quot; of . The image of a function is a subset of its codomain so it might not coincide with it. Namely, a function that is not surjective has elements in its codomain for which the equation does not have a solution.

A codomain is not part of a function if is defined as just a graph. For example in set theory it is desirable to permit the domain of a function to be a proper class , in which case there is formally no such thing as a triple . With such a definition functions do not have a codomain, although some authors still use it informally after introducing a function in the form .

== Examples ==
For a function
:formula_1
defined by
: formula_2 or equivalently formula_3
the codomain of is formula_4, but does not map to any negative number. 
Thus the image of is the set formula_5; i.e., the interval .

An alternative function is defined thus: 
: formula_6
: formula_7

While and map a given to the same number, they are not, in this view, the same function because they have different codomains. A third function can be defined to demonstrate why:
: formula_8

The domain of cannot be formula_9 but can be defined to be formula_5:
: formula_11

The compositions are denoted
: formula_12
: formula_13

On inspection, is not useful. It is true, unless defined otherwise, that the image of is not known; it is only known that it is a subset of formula_4. For this reason, it is possible that , when composed with , might receive an argument for which no output is defined – negative numbers are not elements of the domain of , which is the square root function.

Function composition therefore is a useful notion only when the &quot;codomain&quot; of the function on the right side of a composition (not its &quot;image&quot;, which is a consequence of the function and could be unknown at the level of the composition) is a subset of the domain of the function on the left side.

The codomain affects whether a function is a surjection, in that the function is surjective if and only if its codomain equals its image. In the example, is a surjection while is not. The codomain does not affect whether a function is an injection.

A second example of the difference between codomain and image is demonstrated by the linear transformations between two vector spaces – in particular, all the linear transformations from formula_15 to itself, which can be represented by the matrices with real coefficients. Each matrix represents a map with the domain formula_15 and codomain formula_15. However, the image is uncertain. Some transformations may have image equal to the whole codomain (in this case the matrices with rank ) but many do not, instead mapping into some smaller subspace (the matrices with rank or ). Take for example the matrix given by
:formula_18
which represents a linear transformation that maps the point to . The point is not in the image of , but is still in the codomain since linear transformations from formula_15 to formula_15 are of explicit relevance. Just like all matrices, represents a member of that set. Examining the differences between the image and codomain can often be useful for discovering properties of the function in question. For example, it can be concluded that does not have full rank since its image is smaller than the whole codomain.

<text>A world&#x27;s fair, also known as a universal exhibition, is a large global exhibition designed to showcase the achievements of nations. These exhibitions vary in character and are held in different parts of the world at a specific site for a period of time, typically between three and six months.

The term &quot;world&#x27;s fair&quot; is commonly used in the United States, while the French term, (&quot;universal exhibition&quot;) is used in most of Europe and Asia; other terms include World Expo or Specialised Expo, with the word expo used for various types of exhibitions since at least 1958.

Since the adoption of the 1928 Convention Relating to International Exhibitions, the Paris-based Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) has served as an international sanctioning body for international exhibitions; four types of international exhibition are organised under its auspices: World Expos, Specialised Expos, Horticultural Expos (regulated by the International Association of Horticultural Producers), and the Milan Triennial.

Astana, Kazakhstan held the most recent Specialised Expo in 2017 while Dubai, United Arab Emirates hosted World Expo 2020 (postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic) and Doha, Qatar hosted Horticultural Expo in 2023.

==History==
In 1791, Prague organized the first World&#x27;s Fair in Bohemia (modern-day Czech Republic). The first industrial exhibition was on the occasion of the coronation of Leopold II as king of Bohemia. The exhibition was held in the Clementinum, and celebrated the considerable sophistication of manufacturing methods in the Czech lands during that time period. France had a tradition of national exhibitions, which culminated with the French Industrial Exposition of 1844 held in Paris. This fair was followed by other national exhibitions in Europe. 
In 1851, the &quot;Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations&quot; was held in the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park, London, United Kingdom. The Great Exhibition, as it is often called, was an idea of Prince Albert, Queen Victoria&#x27;s husband, and is usually considered to be the first international exhibition of manufactured products. It influenced the development of several aspects of society, including art-and-design education, international trade and relations, and tourism. This expo was the precedent for the many international exhibitions, later called &quot;World Expos&quot;, that have continued to be held to the present time.

The character of world fairs, or expositions, has evolved since the first one in 1851. Three eras can be distinguished: the era of industrialization, the era of cultural exchange, and the era of nation branding.

===Industrialization (1851–1938)===
The first era, the era of &quot;industrialization&quot;, roughly covered the years from 1850 to 1938. In these years, world expositions were largely focused on trade and displayed technological advances and inventions. World expositions were platforms for state-of-the-art science and technology from around the world. The world expositions of 1851 London, 1853 New York, 1862 London, 1876 Philadelphia, Paris 1878, 1888 Barcelona, 1889 Paris, 1891 Prague, 1893 Chicago, 1897 Brussels, 1900 Paris, 1904 St. Louis, 1915 San Francisco, and 1933–1934 Chicago were notable in this respect. Inventions such as the telephone were first presented during this era. This era set the basic character of the world fair.

===Cultural exchange (1939–1987)===

The 1939–1940 New York World&#x27;s Fair, and those that followed, took a different approach, one less focused on technology and aimed more at cultural themes and social progress. For instance, the theme of the 1939 fair was &quot;Building the World of Tomorrow&quot;; at the 1964–1965 New York World&#x27;s Fair, it was &quot;Peace Through Understanding&quot;; at the 1967 International and Universal Exposition in Montreal, it was &quot;Man and His World&quot;. These fairs encouraged effective intercultural communication along with sharing of technological innovation.

The 1967 International and Universal Exposition in Montreal was promoted under the name &quot;Expo 67&quot;. Event organizers retired the term &quot;world&#x27;s fair&quot; in favor of &quot;Expo&quot; (the Montreal Expos, a former Major League Baseball team, was named for the 1967 fair).

===Nation branding (1988–present)===
From World Expo 88 in Brisbane onwards, countries started to use expositions as a platform to improve their national image through their pavilions. Finland, Japan, Canada, France, and Spain are cases in point. A major study by Tjaco Walvis called &quot;Expo 2000 Hanover in Numbers&quot; showed that improving national image was the main goal for 73% of the countries participating in Expo 2000. Pavilions became a kind of advertising campaign, and the Expo served as a vehicle for &quot;nation branding&quot;. According to branding expert Wally Olins, Spain used Expo &#x27;92 and the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona in the same year to underscore its new position as a modern and democratic country and to show itself as a prominent member of the European Union and the global community.

At Expo 2000 Hanover, countries created their own architectural pavilions, investing, on average, €12 million each. Given these costs, governments are sometimes hesitant to participate, because the benefits may not justify the costs. However, while the effects are difficult to measure, an independent study for the Dutch pavilion at Expo 2000 estimated that the pavilion (which cost around €35 million) generated around €350 million of potential revenues for the Dutch economy. It also identified several key success factors for world-exposition pavilions in general.

==Types==

At present there are two types of international exhibition: World Expos (formally known as International Registered Exhibitions) and Specialised Expos (formally known as International Recognised Exhibitions). World Expos, previously known as universal expositions, are the biggest category events. At World Expos, participants generally build their own pavilions. They are therefore the most extravagant and most expensive expos. Their duration may be between six weeks and six months. Since 1995, the interval between two World Expos has been at least five years. World Expo 2015 was held in Milan, Italy, from 1 May to 31 October 2015.

Specialised Expos are smaller in scope and investments and generally shorter in duration; between three weeks and three months. Previously, these Expos were called Special Exhibitions or International Specialized Exhibitions but these terms are no longer used officially. Their total surface area must not exceed and organizers must build pavilions for the participating states, free of rent, charges, taxes and expenses. The largest country pavilions may not exceed 1,000 m2 ( acre). Only one Specialised Expo can be held between two World Expos.

An additional two types of international exhibition may be recognized by the BIE: horticultural exhibitions, which are joint BIE and AIPH-sanctioned &#x27;garden&#x27; fairs in which participants present gardens and garden pavilions; and the semi-regular Milan Triennial (not always held every third year) art and design exhibition, held in Milan, Italy, with the BIE granting official international exhibition status to 14 editions of the Triennale between 1996 and 2016.

===World Expos===
World Expos (formally known as International Registered Exhibitions) encompass universal themes that affect the full gamut of human experience, and international and corporate participants are required to adhere to the theme in their representations. Registered expositions are held every 5 years because they are more expensive as they require total design of pavilion buildings from the ground up. As a result, nations compete for the most outstanding or memorable structure—for example Japan, France, Morocco, and Spain at Expo &#x27;92. Sometimes prefabricated structures are used to minimize costs for developing countries, or for countries from a geographical block to share space (i.e. Plaza of the Americas at Seville &#x27;92).

In the 21st century the BIE has moved to sanction World Expos every five years; following the numerous expos of the 1980s and 1990s, some see this as a means to cut down potential expenditure by participating nations. The move was also seen by some as an attempt to avoid conflicting with the Summer Olympics. World Expos are restricted to every five years, with Specialized Expos in the in-between years.

===Specialised Expos===
Specialized Expos (formally known as International Recognized Exhibitions) are usually united by a precise theme—such as &quot;Future Energy&quot; (Expo 2017 Astana), &quot;The Living Ocean and Coast&quot; (Expo 2012 Yeosu), or &quot;Leisure in the Age of Technology&quot; (Brisbane, Expo &#x27;88). Such themes are more specific than the wider scope of world expositions.

Specialized Expos are usually smaller in scale and cheaper to run for the host committee and participants because the architectural fees are lower and they only have to customize pavilion space provided free of charge from the Organiser, usually with the prefabricated structure already completed. Countries then have the option of &quot;adding&quot; their own colours, design etc. to the outside of the prefabricated structure and filling in the inside with their own content.

===Horticultural Expos===
Horticultural Expos (formally known as A1 International Horticultural Exhibitions) are co-regulated by International Association of Horticultural Producers. Like Specialised Expos are organized in a precise theme—such as &quot;Green Desert, Better Environment&quot; (International Horticultural Expo 2023 Doha Qatar), &quot;Growing Green Cities&quot; (Floriade 2022), or &quot;Building a Beautiful Home Featuring Harmonious Coexistence between Man and Nature&quot; (Expo 2019).

The purpose of these exhibitions is to foster cooperation and the sharing of knowledge and solutions between countries, horticultural producers and agricultural industries by addressing the paramount issues of healthy lifestyles, green economies, sustainable living, education and innovation.

==Legacies==

===Remaining structures===

Most of the structures are temporary and are dismantled after the fair closes, except for landmark towers. By far the most famous of these is the Eiffel Tower, built for the Exposition Universelle (1889). Although it is now the most recognized symbol of its host city Paris, there were contemporary critics opposed to its construction, and demands for it to be dismantled after the fair&#x27;s conclusion.

Other structures that remain from these fairs:
* 1851 – London: The Crystal Palace, from the first World&#x27;s Fair in London, designed so that it could be recycled to recoup losses, was such a success that it was moved and intended to be permanent, only to be destroyed by a fire in 1936.
* 1876 – Philadelphia: The Centennial Exposition&#x27;s main building, Memorial Hall, is still in Fairmount Park, Philadelphia, and serving as the new home for the Please Touch Museum. The space under the entrance to Memorial Hall houses a scale model of the entire Exposition.
* 1880 – Melbourne: The World Heritage–listed Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne, constructed for the Melbourne International Exhibition.
* 1893 – Chicago: The Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago is housed in the former Palace of Fine Arts, one of the last remaining buildings of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. In conjunction with the fair, the Art Institute of Chicago building was built to house conferences, as the World&#x27;s Congress Auxiliary Building. The Garden of the Phoenix, a remnant of the Japanese pavilion, also survives. The intent or hope was to make all Columbian structures permanent, but most of the structures burned, possibly the result of arson during the Pullman Strike. The foundation of the world&#x27;s first Ferris wheel, which operated at the Exposition, was unearthed on the Chicago Midway during a construction project by the University of Chicago, whose campus now surrounds the Midway. Relocated survivors include the Norway pavilion, a small house now at a museum in Wisconsin, and the Maine State Building, now at the Poland Springs Resort in Maine.
* 1894 – San Francisco: The Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco&#x27;s Golden Gate Park is the last major remnant of the California Midwinter International Exposition. Large ornamental wooden gates and a pagoda from the 1915 Panama–Pacific International Exposition were brought in after the latter fair closed, making the Tea Garden a rare if not unique instance of a survivor that incorporates architectural features from two completely separate fairs.
* 1897 – Nashville: A full-scale replica of the Parthenon was built for the Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition where it stands today in Nashville&#x27;s Centennial Park. It features plaster reproductions of the Elgin Marbles and, in 1990, a re-creation of the original Athena Parthenos statue was installed inside just as it was in the original Parthenon in ancient Greece.
* 1900 – Paris: the Grand Palais and Petit Palais.
* 1904 – St. Louis: The St. Louis Art Museum in Forest Park, originally the Palace of the Fine Arts, and Brookings Hall at Washington University in St. Louis, are remnants of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (held a year late, as it was originally intended to be the centennial of the Louisiana Purchase. But organizers, and President Theodore Roosevelt, wanted the fair to be held during the Olympics which were moved from Chicago.), better known as the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair. The aviary in Forest Park gave root to the St. Louis Zoo.
* 1906 – Milan: The Civic Aquarium of Milan built for the Milan Exposition is still open after 100 years and was recently renovated. The International Commission on Occupational Health (ICOH) was settled in Milan during the fair and had its first congress in the Expo pavilions. In June 2006 the ICOH celebrated the first century of its life in Milan. An elevated railway with trains running at short intervals linked the fair to the city center. It was dismantled in the 1920s.
* 1909 – Seattle: The landscaping (by the Olmsted brothers) from the Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition (AYPE) in Seattle still forms much of the University of Washington campus. The only major building left from the AYPE, Architecture Hall, is used by the university&#x27;s architecture school.
* 1915 – San Francisco: The Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco and its adjacent artificial lagoon are the only major remnants of the Panama–Pacific International Exposition still in their original locations on the former fairgrounds (now the city&#x27;s Marina District neighborhood), but the building is almost entirely a reconstruction. The plaster-surfaced original, not intended to survive after the fair, was a crumbling ruin in 1964 when all but the steel framework was demolished so that it could be reproduced in concrete. The San Francisco Civic Auditorium, now the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, is another major legacy of the fair but was built off-site in the city&#x27;s Civic Center. The independent Panama–California Exposition in San Diego left a substantial legacy of permanent buildings and other structures which today define its site, San Diego&#x27;s central Balboa Park, including the Prado walkway, the California Tower and Dome (now home to the Museum of Us), the 1,500-foot Cabrillo Bridge, the lily pond and botanical gardens, and the Spreckels Organ Pavilion.
* 1929 – Seville and Barcelona: much survives from the two simultaneous fairs Spain hosted that year. The most famous are the remnants of the Ibero-American Exposition in Seville, in which the Spanish Pavilion&#x27;s &quot;Plaza de España&quot; forms part of a large park and forecourt. Most of that fair&#x27;s pavilions have survived and been adapted for other uses, with many of them becoming consulates-general for the countries that built them. The Barcelona International Exposition featured the famous German pavilion designed by Mies van der Rohe, which was demolished but later rebuilt on the original site.
* 1936 – Johannesburg: The Empire Exhibition, South Africa was built close to the University of the Witwatersrand, and by the late 1970s the growth of the university was large enough to incorporate the permanent buildings from the exhibition. In 1985, the university purchased the South African Government Building; the two Heavy Machinery Halls, now called Empire Hall and the Dining Hall; the Hall of Transport; the Tower of Light; the Cape Dutch complex; and the Bien Donne Restaurant.
* 1939 – New York City: The New York City Building from the 1939&#x27;s World Fair, was reused for the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair and is now the Queens Museum. Parachute jump was a ride from the fair. It was moved to the Coney island boardwalk in Brooklyn.
* 1942 – Rome: A special case is the EUR quarter in Rome, built for a World&#x27;s Fair planned for 1942 but cancelled because of World War II. Today it hosts governmental and private offices, and several museums.
* 1958 – Brussels: In Brussels, the Atomium still stands at the exposition site. It is a 165-billion-times-enlarged iron-crystal-shaped building. Until June 2012, the &quot;American Theatre&quot; on the Expo grounds was frequently used as a television studio by the VRT.

* 1962 – Seattle: The Space Needle theme building of the Century 21 Exposition commonly known as the Seattle World&#x27;s Fair still stands as a Seattle icon and landmark. The Seattle Center Monorail, the other widely known futuristic feature of the fair, still operates daily. The US pavilion became the Pacific Science Center. The original exterior and roof of the Washington State Pavilion has been preserved as a landmark, and now is part of Climate Pledge Arena.

* 1964 – New York City: many structures still stand
** The Unisphere, built for the second New York World&#x27;s Fair, stands on its original site in Flushing Meadows, Queens
** New York Hall of Science, built for the fair, continues to operate as a science museum, similar to its original role
** The Port Authority Heliport and Exhibit is now the Terrace on the Park event and catering venue
** The New York State Pavilion is mostly derelict, but is still an icon, with its observation towers prominently featured in 1997&#x27;s &quot;Men in Black&quot;. The Theaterama building is the only portion still maintained, and is used by the Queens Theater. The Tent of Tomorrow building and observation towers are being restored .
** The New York City Pavilion, a holdover form the 1939 fair, continues to serve as the home of the Queens Museum
** Other artifacts remain throughout the park, and many buildings were transported for use elsewhere and continue to function.
* 1967 – Montreal: Among the structures still standing from Expo 67 in Montreal are Moshe Safdie&#x27;s Habitat 67, Buckminster Fuller&#x27;s American pavilion the &quot;Montreal Biosphere&quot;, the Jamaica Pavilion, the Tunisia Pavilion, and the French pavilion (now the Montreal Casino).
* 1968 – San Antonio: San Antonio kept the Tower of the Americas, the Institute of Texan Cultures and the Convention Center from HemisFair &#x27;68.
* 1970 – Osaka: The Tower of the Sun was left standing, but was neglected after the conclusion of the Expo &#x27;70. After restoration to the structure was completed, the museum inside the tower was re-opened on 18 March 2018.
* 1974 – Spokane: Spokane still has its Riverfront Park that was created for Expo &#x27;74—the park remains a popular and iconic part of Spokane&#x27;s downtown.

* 1982 – Knoxville: The Sunsphere from the Knoxville World&#x27;s Fair remains as a feature of Knoxville&#x27;s skyline.
* 1984 – New Orleans: The main pavilions of the 1984 New Orleans World&#x27;s Fair became the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, which is also known for its use as a shelter of last resort during Hurricane Katrina and later hosted the Miss Universe in 2022.
* 1986 – Vancouver: In Vancouver, many Expo 86 projects were designed as legacy projects. Of note are the Skytrain, Science World and Canada Place.
* 1988 – Brisbane: The Skyneedle, the symbol tower of Expo &#x27;88 in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, still stands. Other survivors are the Nepalese Peace Pagoda of the Nepalese representation, now at the transformed World Expo &#x27;88 site South Bank Parklands, and the Japan Pond and Garden from the Japanese representation, now at the Brisbane Mount Cooth-tha Botanic Gardens. In 2018 the World Expo 88 Art Trail was re-birthed and dramatically expanded as part of the 30th Anniversary of World expo 88, now forming a Major tourist attraction in its own right.
* 1992 – Seville: The pavilions of Expo &#x27;92 in Seville had been converted into a technological square and a theme park.
* 1998 – Lisbon: The main buildings of Expo &#x27;98 in Lisbon were completely integrated into the city itself and many of the art exhibition pieces still remain.
* 2005 – Nagoya: The home of Satsuki &amp; Mei Kusakabe, built for the 2005 Expo in Aichi, remains operating at its original site in Morikoro Park and is a popular tourist attraction, eventually being incorporated into Ghibli Park in 2022.

* 2010 – Shanghai: The China pavilion from Expo 2010 in Shanghai, the largest display in the history of the World Expo, is now the China Art Museum, the largest art museum in Asia.
* 2015 – Milan: The Italian Pavilion of Expo 2015 remains on the original site.

===Relocation of pavilions===
Some pavilions have been transported overseas intact:
* The Argentine Pavilion from the 1889 Paris was relocated to Buenos Aires, Argentina until its demolition in 1932.
* The Chilean Pavilion from 1889 Paris is now in Santiago, Chile and following significant refurbishment in 1992 functions as the Museo Artequin
* The Peruvian Pavilion from 1900 Paris is now in Lima, as home to the Military Academy of History.
* The Japanese Tower of the 1900 World&#x27;s Fair in Paris was relocated to Laken (Brussels) on request of King Leopold II of Belgium.
* The Belgium Pavilion from the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair was relocated to Virginia Union University in Richmond, Virginia.
* The USSR Pavilion from Expo 67 is now in Moscow.
* The Sanyo Pavilion from Expo &#x27;70 is the Asian Centre at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.
* The Portugal Pavilion from Expo 2000 is now in Coimbra, Portugal.
* The United Arab Emirates Pavilion from Expo 2010 is now in Saadiyat Island in Abu Dhabi in UAE
* The Bahrain Pavilion from Expo 2015 was relocated to Bahrain. The Azerbaijan Pavilion is in that country&#x27;s capital Baku. The Chinese Pavilion was brought back to Qingdao and is on the site of the 2014 horticultural exhibition.
* The Save the Children Italy pavilion from Expo 2015 was dismantled and re-built as school for Syrian refugee children in Lebanon.

The Brussels Expo &#x27;58 relocated many pavilions within Belgium: the pavilion of Jacques Chocolats moved to the town of Diest to house the new town swimming pool. Another pavilion was relocated to Willebroek and has been used as dance hall Carré ever since. One smaller pavilion still stands on the boulevard towards the Atomium: the restaurant &quot;Salon 58&quot; in the pavilion of Comptoir Tuilier.

===Other legacies===
Many exhibitions and rides created by Walt Disney and his WED Enterprises company for the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair (which was held over into 1965) were moved to Disneyland after the closing of the Fair. Many of the rides, including &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World&quot;, and &quot;Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln&quot;, as well as the building that housed the Carousel of Progress are still in operation. The concept of a permanent world&#x27;s fair came to fruition with the Disney Epcot theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort, near Orlando, Florida. Epcot has many characteristics of a typical universal exposition: national pavilions and exhibits concerning technology and/or the future, along with more typical amusement park rides. Meanwhile, several of the 1964 attractions that were relocated to Disneyland have been duplicated at the Walt Disney World Resort.

Occasionally other mementos of the fairs remain. In the New York City Subway system, signs directing people to Flushing Meadows–Corona Park remain from the 1964–1965 event. In the Montreal Metro subway at least one tile artwork of its theme, &quot;Man and His World&quot;, remains. Also, a seemingly endless supply of souvenir items from fair visits can be found, and in the United States, at least, often turn up at garage or estate sales. Many fairs and expos produced postage stamps and commemorative coins.

<text>The Louisiana Purchase Exposition, informally known as the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair, was an international exposition held in St. Louis, Missouri, United States, from April 30 to December 1, 1904. Local, state, and federal funds totaling $15 million (equivalent to $ in ) were used to finance the event. More than 60 countries and 43 of the then-45 American states maintained exhibition spaces at the fair, which was attended by nearly 19.7 million people.

Historians generally emphasize the prominence of the themes of race and imperialism, and the fair&#x27;s long-lasting impact on intellectuals in the fields of history, architecture, and anthropology. From the point of view of the memory of the average person who attended the fair, it primarily promoted entertainment, consumer goods, and popular culture. The monumental Greco-Roman architecture of this and other fairs of the era did much to influence permanent new buildings and master plans of major cities.

==Background==

In 1904, St. Louis hosted a world&#x27;s fair to celebrate the centennial of the 1803 Louisiana Purchase. The idea for such a commemorative event seems to have emerged early in 1898, with Kansas City and St. Louis initially presented as potential hosts for a fair based on their central location within the territory encompassed by the 1803 land annexation.

The exhibition was grand in scale and lengthy in preparation, with an initial $5 million committed by the city of St. Louis through the sale of city bonds, authorized by the Missouri state legislature in April 1899. An additional $5 million was generated through private donations by interested citizens and businesses from around Missouri, a fundraising target reached in January 1901. The final installment of $5 million of the exposition&#x27;s $15 million capitalization came in the form of earmarked funds that were part of a congressional appropriations bill passed at the end of May 1900. The fundraising mission was aided by the active support of President of the United States William McKinley, which was won by organizers in a February 1899 White House visit.

While initially conceived as a centennial celebration to be held in 1903, the actual opening of the St. Louis exposition was delayed until April 30, 1904, to allow for full-scale participation by more states and foreign countries. The exposition operated until December 1, 1904. During the year of the fair, the Louisiana Purchase Exposition supplanted the annual St. Louis Exposition of agricultural, trade, and scientific exhibitions which had been held in the city since the 1880s.

The fair&#x27;s site, designed by George Kessler, was located at the present-day grounds of Forest Park and on the campus of Washington University, and was the largest fair (in area) to date. There were over 1,500 buildings, connected by some of roads and walkways. It was said to be impossible to give even a hurried glance at everything in less than a week. The Palace of Agriculture alone covered some .

Exhibits were staged by approximately 50 foreign nations, the United States government, and 43 of the then-45 US states. These featured industries, cities, private organizations and corporations, theater troupes, and music schools. There were also over 50 concession-type amusements found on &quot;The Pike&quot;; they provided educational and scientific displays, exhibits and imaginary &#x27;travel&#x27; to distant lands, history and local boosterism (including Louis Wollbrinck&#x27;s &quot;Old St. Louis&quot;) and pure entertainment.

Over 19 million individuals were in attendance at the fair.

Aspects that attracted visitors included the buildings and architecture, new foods, popular music, and exotic people on display. American culture was showcased at the fair especially regarding innovations in communication, medicine, and transportation.

==Architects==
George Kessler, who designed many urban parks in Texas and the Midwest, created the master design for the Fair.

A popular myth says that Frederick Law Olmsted, who had died the year before the Fair, designed the park and fair grounds. There are several reasons for this confusion. First, Kessler in his twenties had worked briefly for Olmsted as a Central Park gardener. Second, Olmsted was involved with Forest Park in Queens, New York. Third, Olmsted had planned the renovations in 1897 to the Missouri Botanical Garden several blocks to the southeast of the park. Finally, Olmsted&#x27;s sons advised Washington University on integrating the campus with the park across the street.

In 1901, the Louisiana Purchase Exposition Corporation selected prominent St. Louis architect Isaac S. Taylor as the Chairman of the Architectural Commission and Director of Works for the fair, supervising the overall design and construction. Taylor quickly appointed Emmanuel Louis Masqueray to be his Chief of Design. In the position for three years, Masqueray designed the following Fair buildings: Palace of Agriculture, the Cascades and Colonnades, Palace of Forestry, Fish, and Game, Palace of Horticulture and Palace of Transportation, all of which were widely emulated in civic projects across the United States as part of the City Beautiful movement. Masqueray resigned shortly after the Fair opened in 1904, having been invited by Archbishop John Ireland of St. Paul, Minnesota to design a new cathedral for the city. The Palace of Electricity was designed by Messrs. Walker &amp; Kimball, of Omaha, Nebraska. It covered and cost over $400,000 (equivalent to more than $ in ). Crowning the great towers were heroic groups of statuary typifying the various attributes of electricity.

==Board of Commissioners==
Florence Hayward, a successful freelance writer in St. Louis in the 1900s, was determined to play a role in the World&#x27;s Fair. She negotiated a position on the otherwise all-male Board of Commissioners. Hayward learned that one of the potential contractors for the fair was not reputable and warned the Louisiana Purchase Exposition Company (LPEC). In exchange for this information, she requested an appointment as roving commissioner to Europe.

Former Mayor of St. Louis and Governor of Missouri David R. Francis, LPEC president, made the appointment and allowed Hayward to travel overseas to promote the fair, especially to women. The fair also had a Board of Lady Managers (BLM) who felt they had jurisdiction over women&#x27;s activities at the fair and objected to Hayward&#x27;s appointment without their knowledge. Despite this, Hayward set out for England in 1902. Hayward&#x27;s most notable contribution to the fair was acquiring gifts Queen Victoria received for her Golden Jubilee and other historical items, including manuscripts from the Vatican. These items were all to be shown in exhibits at the fair.

Pleased with her success in Europe, Francis put her in charge of historical exhibits in the anthropology division, which had originally been assigned to Pierre Chouteau III. Despite being the only woman on the Board of Commissioners, creating successful anthropological exhibits, publicizing the fair, and acquiring significant exhibit items, Hayward&#x27;s role in the fair was not acknowledged. When Francis published a history of the fair in 1913, he did not mention Hayward&#x27;s contributions and she never forgave the slight.

==Scientific contributions==

Many of the inventions displayed were precursors to items which have become an integral part of today&#x27;s culture. Novel applications of electricity and light waves for communication and medical use were displayed in the Palace of Electricity. According to an article he wrote for Harper&#x27;s Weekly, W. E. Goldsborough, the Chief of the Department of Electricity for the Fair, wished to educate the public and dispel the misconceptions about electricity which many common people believed. New and updated methods of transportation also showcased at the World&#x27;s Fair in the Palace of Transportation would come to revolutionize transportation for the modern day.

===Communication contributions===

Wireless telephone – The &quot;wireless telephony&quot; unit or &quot;radiophone&quot; was invented by Alexander Graham Bell and installed at the St. Louis World Fair. This radiophone comprised a sound-light transmitter and a light-sound receiver, as an apparatus in the Palace of Electricity transmitted music or speech to a receiver in the courtyard. Visitors heard the transmission when holding the cordless receiver to the ear. It developed into the radio and telephone.

Early fax machine – The telautograph was invented in 1888 by American scientist Elisha Gray, who contested Alexander Graham Bell&#x27;s invention of the telephone. A person wrote on one end of the telautograph, which electrically communicated with the receiving pen to recreate drawings on paper. In 1900, assistant Foster Ritchie improved the device to display at the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair and market for the next thirty years. This developed into the fax machine.

===Medical contributions===
Finsen light – The Finsen light, invented by Niels Ryberg Finsen, treated tuberculosis luposa. Finsen received the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 1903. This pioneered phototherapy.

X-ray machine – The X-ray machine was launched at the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair. German scientist Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen discovered X-rays studying electrification of low pressure gas. He X-rayed his wife&#x27;s hand, capturing her bones and wedding ring to show colleagues. Thomas Edison and assistant Clarence Dally recreated the machine. Dally failed to test another X-ray machine at the 1901 World&#x27;s Fair after President McKinley was assassinated. A perfected X-ray machine was successfully exhibited at the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair. X-rays are now commonplace in hospitals and airports.

Infant incubator – Although infant incubators were invented in the year 1888 by Drs. Alan M. Thomas and William Champion, adoption was not immediate. To advertise the benefits, incubators containing preterm babies were displayed at the 1897, 1898, 1901, and 1904 World Fairs. These provided immunocompromised neonates a sanitary environment. Each incubator comprised an airtight glass box with a metal frame. Hot forced air thermoregulated the container. Newspapers advertised the incubators with &quot;lives are being preserved by this wonderful method.&quot; During the 1904 World Fair, E. M. Bayliss exhibited these devices on The Pike where approximately ten nurses cared for twenty-four neonates. The entrance fee was 25 cents () while the adjoining shop and café offered souvenirs and refreshments. Proceeds totaling $181,632 (equivalent to $ in ) helped fund Bayliss&#x27;s project. Inconsistent sanitation killed some babies, so glass walls were installed between them and visitors, shielding the infants. These developed into &quot;isolettes&quot; in modern neonatal intensive care units.

===Transportation contributions===
Electric streetcar – North American street railways from the early 19th century were being introduced to electric street railcars. An electric streetcar on a track demonstrated its speed, acceleration, and braking outside the Palace of Electricity. Many downtown trams today are electric.

Personal automobile – The Palace of Transportation displayed automobiles and motor cars. The private automobile was revealed here. The automobile display contained 140 models including ones powered by gasoline, steam, and electricity. Inventor Lee de Forest demonstrated a prototype car radio. Four years later, the Ford Motor Company began producing the affordable Ford Model T.

Airplane – The 1904 World&#x27;s Fair hosted the first &quot;Airship Contest&quot;. Stationary air balloons demarcated a time trial with a minimum speed limit of . Nobody won the $100,000 grand prize (equivalent to $ in ). The contest witnessed the first public dirigible flight in America. A history of aviation in St. Louis followed, leading to the nickname Flight City.

==Legacy==
St. Louis&#x27; status as an up-and-coming city garnered interest from many reporters and photographers who attended the World&#x27;s Fair and found its citizens constantly on the &quot;go&quot; and the streets &quot;crowded with activity&quot;. One observer remarked that, at this time, St. Louis had more energy in its streets than any other northern city did.

===Buildings===
With more and more people interested in the city, St. Louis government and architects were primarily concerned with their ports and access to the city. The city originating as a trading post, transportation by water was important. It was becoming even more important that the port be open, but efficient for all visitors. It also needed to show off some of the city&#x27;s flair and excitement, which is why in many photographs one sees photos of St. Louis&#x27; skyscrapers in the background. In addition to a functioning port, the Eads Bridge was constructed, which was considered one of St. Louis&#x27; &quot;sights&quot;. At long, it connected Missouri and Illinois, and was the first large-scale application of steel as a structural material. 

As with the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, all but one of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition&#x27;s grand, neo-Classical exhibition palaces were temporary structures, designed to last but a year or two. They were built with a material called &quot;staff,&quot; a mixture of plaster of Paris and hemp fibers, on a wood frame. As at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair, buildings and statues deteriorated during the months of the Fair and had to be patched.

The Administration Building, designed by Cope &amp; Stewardson, is now Brookings Hall, the defining landmark on the campus of Washington University. A similar building was erected at Northwest Missouri State University founded in 1905 in Maryville, Missouri. The grounds&#x27; layout was also recreated in Maryville and now is designated as the official Missouri State Arboretum.

The Palace of Fine Art, designed by architect Cass Gilbert, featured a grand interior sculpture court based on the Roman Baths of Caracalla. Standing at the top of Art Hill, it now serves as the home of the St. Louis Art Museum.

The huge bird cage at the Saint Louis Zoological Park, dates to the fair. A Jain temple carved out of teak stood within the Indian Pavilion near the Ferris Wheel. It was dismantled after the exhibition and was reconstructed in Las Vegas at the Castaways hotel. It has recently been reassembled and is now on display at the Jain Center of Southern California at Los Angeles. Birmingham, Alabama&#x27;s iconic cast iron Vulcan statue was first exhibited at the Fair in the Palace of Mines and Metallurgy. Additionally, a plaster reproduction of &quot;Alma Mater&quot; at Columbia University by Daniel Chester French was displayed at the Grand Sculpture Court of the exhibition.

The Missouri State building was the largest of the state buildings, as Missouri was the host state. Though it had sections with marble floors and heating and air conditioning, it was planned to be a temporary structure. However, it burned the night of November 18–19, just eleven days before the Fair was to end. Most interior contents were destroyed, but furniture and much of the Model Library were undamaged. The fair being almost over, the building was not rebuilt. In 1909–10, the current World&#x27;s Fair Pavilion in Forest Park was built on the site of the Missouri building with profits from the fair.

Festival Hall, designed by Cass Gilbert and used for large-scale musical pageants, contained the largest organ in the world at the time, built by the Los Angeles Art Organ Company (which went bankrupt as a result). The great organ was debuted by the fair&#x27;s official organist, Charles Henry Galloway. Though the opening concert was scheduled for the first day of the fair, complications related to its construction resulted in the opening concert being postponed until June 9. After the fair, the organ was placed into storage, and eventually purchased by John Wanamaker for his new Wanamaker&#x27;s store in Philadelphia where it was tripled in size and became known as the Wanamaker Organ. The famous Bronze Eagle in the Wanamaker Store also came from the Fair. It features hundreds of hand-forged bronze feathers and was the centerpiece of one of the many German exhibits. Wanamaker&#x27;s became a Lord &amp; Taylor store and more recently, a Macy&#x27;s store.

Completed in 1913, the Jefferson Memorial building was built near the main entrance to the Exposition, at Lindell and DeBalivere. It was built with proceeds from the fair, to commemorate Thomas Jefferson, who initiated the Louisiana Purchase, as was the first memorial to the third President. It became the headquarters of the Missouri History Museum, and stored the Exposition&#x27;s records and archives when the Louisiana Purchase Exposition company completed its mission. The building is now home to the Missouri History Museum, and the museum was significantly expanded in 2002–3.

The State of Maine Building, which was a rustic cabin, was transported to Point Lookout, Missouri where it overlooked the White River by sportsmen who formed the Maine Hunting and Fishing Club. In 1915, when the main building at the College of the Ozarks in Forsyth, Missouri burned, the school relocated to Point Lookout, where the Maine building was renamed the Dobyns Building in honor of a school president. The Dobyns Building burned in 1930 and the college&#x27;s signature church was built in its place. In 2004, a replica of the Maine building was built on the campus. The Keeter Center is named for another school president.

The observation tower erected by the American DeForest Wireless Telegraph Company was brought to the Fair when it became a hazard near Niagara Falls and needed to be removed because in the wintertime, ice from the fall&#x27;s mist would form on the steel structure, and eventually fall onto the buildings below. It served as a communications platform for Lee DeForest&#x27;s work in wireless telegraphy and a platform to view the fair. As Niagara Falls was near Buffalo New York, it was also called the Buffalo Tower After the World&#x27;s Fair, it was moved to Creve Coeur Lake to be part of that park.

The Swedish Pavilion is still preserved in Lindsborg, Kansas. Designed by Swedish architect Ferdinand Boberg, it is the only one of his international exposition buildings in existence today. After the fair, the Pavilion was moved to Bethany College in Lindsborg, where it was used for classroom, library, museum and department facilities for the art department. In 1969, it was moved to the Lindsborg Old Mill &amp; Swedish Heritage Museum where it serves as a venue for community events. The Pavilion was added to the National Historic Register in 1973.

Westinghouse Electric sponsored the Westinghouse Auditorium, where they showed films of Westinghouse factories and products.

Some mansions from the Exposition&#x27;s era survive along Lindell Boulevard at the north border of Forest Park.

===Introduction of new foods===
A number of foods are claimed to have been invented at the fair. The most popular claim is that of the waffle-style ice cream cone. However, its popularization, not invention, is widely believed to have taken place here. Dubious claims include the hamburger and hot dog (both traditional American and European foods of German origin), peanut butter, iced tea, and cotton candy. Again, popularization is more likely. Dr Pepper and Puffed Wheat cereal were introduced to a national audience. Freeborn Annie Fisher received a gold medal for her beaten biscuits famous in her hometown of Columbia, Missouri. President William Howard Taft enjoyed them on his 1911 visit to Missouri.

Though not the debut of as many foods as claimed, the fair offered what was essentially America&#x27;s first food court. Visitors sampled a variety of fast foods, dined in dozens of restaurants, and strolled through the mile-long pike. As one historian said of the fair, &quot;one could breakfast in France, take a mid-morning snack in the Philippines, lunch in Italy, and dine in Japan.&quot;

===Influence on popular music and literature===
The fair inspired the song &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis, Louis&quot;, which was recorded by many artists, including Billy Murray. Both the fair and the song are focal points of the 1944 feature film &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; starring Judy Garland, which also inspired a Broadway musical version. Scott Joplin wrote the rag &quot;Cascades&quot; in honor of the elaborate waterfalls in front of Festival Hall.

A book entitled &quot;Wild Song&quot;, by Candy Gourlay, was inspired by the Louisiana Purchase.

===People on display===


Following the Spanish–American War, the peace treaty granted the United States control over Guam, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico had had a quasi-autonomous government as an &quot;overseas province&quot; of Spain, and the Philippines, having declared independence after the 1896–1899 Philippine Revolution, fought US annexation in the 1899–1902 Philippine–American War. These areas controversially became unincorporated territories of the United States in 1899, and people were brought from these territories to be on &quot;display&quot; at the 1904 fair.

The fair displayed 1,102 Filipinos, 700 of them Philippine Scouts and Philippine Constabulary, used for controlling conflict among Filipinos and between Filipinos and fair organizers. Displays included the Apache of the American Southwest and the Igorots of the Philippines, both of which peoples were noted as &quot;primitive&quot;. Within the Philippine reservation, was a school which was actively teaching Igorot students. At least two Moros were photographed while praying at the fair. The Philippine reservation at the exposition cost $1.1 million (equivalent to $ in ) to create and operate. The people had been trafficked under harsh conditions, and many did not survive. Burial plots in two St. Louis cemeteries were prepared in advance. However, traditional burial practices were not allowed. Some of the people to be exhibited died en route or at the fair and their bodies were immediately removed. Funeral rites had to be conducted without the bodies in front of an oblivious public audience of fair attendees. Organizers choreographed ethnographic displays, having customs which marked special occasions restaged day after day.

Similarly, members of the Southeast Alaskan Tlingit tribe accompanied fourteen totem poles, two Native houses, and a canoe displayed at the Alaska Exhibit. Mary Knight Benson, a noted Pomo basket weaver whose work is curated at the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum of the American Indian, attended to demonstrate her basket making skills which are described as astounding. Athletic events such as a basketball tournament were held to demonstrate the success of the Indian Boarding Schools and other assimilation programs. These efforts were confirmed with the Fort Shaw Indian School girls basketball team who were declared &quot;World Champions&quot; after beating every team who faced them in these denominational games.

It has been argued that the &quot;overriding purpose of the fair really centered on an effort to promote America&#x27;s new role as an overseas imperial power&quot;, and that &quot;While the juxtaposition of &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;primitive&quot; buttressed assumptions of racial superiority, representations of Native American and Filipino life created an impression of continuity between westward expansion across the continent and the new overseas empire.&quot; Racializing concepts and epithets used domestically were extended to the people of the overseas territories.

Ota Benga, a Congolese Pygmy, was featured at the fair. Later he was held captive at the Bronx Zoo in New York, then featured in an exhibit on evolution alongside an orangutan in 1906, but public protest ended that.

In contrast, the Japan pavilion advanced the idea of a modern yet exotic culture unfamiliar to the turn-of-the-century Western world, much as it had during the earlier Chicago World&#x27;s Fair. The Japanese government spent lavishly: $400,000, plus $50,000 from the Japanese colonial government of Formosa, with an additional $250,000 coming from Japanese commercial interests and regional governments; all told, this totaled $700,000 (equivalent to $ in ). A garden, set on the hillside south of the Machinery Hall and Engine House, featured a replica of Kyoto&#x27;s famous Kinkakuji, showing Japan&#x27;s ancient sophistication, and a Formosa Mansion and Tea House, showing her modern colonial efforts. A second exhibition, &quot;Fair Japan on the &#x27;Pike&#x27;,&quot; organized by Kushibiki and Arai, welcomed the public through a large Niōmon-style gate into a realm of geisha-staffed exotic Japanese consumerism.

===Exhibits===
After the fair was completed, many of the international exhibits were not returned to their country of origin, but were dispersed to museums in the United States. For example, the Philippine exhibits were acquired by the Museum of Natural History at the University of Iowa. The Vulcan statue is today a prominent feature of the Vulcan Park and Museum in Birmingham, Alabama, where it was originally cast.

The Smithsonian Institution coordinated the US government exhibits. It featured a blue whale, the first full-cast of a blue whale ever created.

The Fair also featured the original &quot;Floatopia&quot;. Visitors floated on rafts of all sorts in the tiny Forest Park Lake. Many Floatopias have occurred since, including the infamous San Diego Floatopia of &#x27;83 and the Santa Barbara Floatopia that has been happening for years.

One exhibit of note was Beautiful Jim Key, the &quot;educated&quot; Arabian-Hambletonian cross horse in his Silver Horseshoe Pavilion. He was owned by Dr. William Key, an African-American/Native American former slave, who became a respected self-taught veterinarian, and promoted by Albert R. Rogers, who had Jim and Dr. Key on tour for years around the US, helping to establish a humane movement that encouraged people to think of animals as having feelings and thoughts, and not just &quot;brutes.&quot; Jim and Dr. Key became national celebrities along the way. Rogers invented highly successful marketing strategies still in use today. Jim Key could add, subtract, use a cash register, spell with blocks, tell time and give opinions on the politics of the day by shaking his head yes or no. Jim thoroughly enjoyed his &quot;act&quot;—he performed more than just tricks and appeared to clearly understand what was going on. Dr. Key&#x27;s motto was that Jim &quot;was taught by kindness&quot; instead of the whip, which he was indeed.

Daisy E. Nirdlinger&#x27;s book, &quot;Althea, or, the children of Rosemont plantation&quot; (illustrated by Egbert Cadmus (1868–1939)) was adopted by the Commissioners of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition as the official souvenir for young people.

==Olympics==
The Fair hosted the 1904 Summer Olympic Games, the first Olympics to be held in the United States: the Games had originally been awarded to Chicago, but after St. Louis threatened to hold a rival international competition in the same timeframe, the Games were relocated.

Nonetheless, the sporting events, spread out over several months, were overshadowed by the Fair. Due to high travel costs and European tensions arising from the Russo-Japanese War, many European athletes did not attend the Games, nor did the founder of the modern Olympics, Baron Pierre de Coubertin.

==Bullfight riot==
On June 5, 1904, a bullfight scheduled for an arena just north of the fairgrounds, in conjunction with the fair, turned violent when Missouri governor Alexander Monroe Dockery ordered police to halt the fight in light of Missouri&#x27;s anti-bullfighting laws. Disgruntled spectators demanded refunds, and when they were turned away, they began throwing stones through the windows of the arena office. While police protected the office, they did not have sufficient numbers to protect the arena, which was burned to the ground by the mob. The exposition fire department responded to the fire, but disruption to the fair was minimal, as the riot took place on a Sunday, when the fair was closed.

==Anglo-Boer War Concession==
Frank E. Fillis produced what was supposedly &quot;the greatest and most realistic military spectacle known in the history of the world&quot;. Different portions of the concession featured a British Army encampment, several South African native villages (including Zulu, San, Swazi, and Ndebele) and a arena in which soldiers paraded, sporting events and horse races were held and major battles from the Second Boer War were re-enacted twice a day. Battle recreations took 2–3 hours and included several generals and 600 veteran soldiers from both sides of the war. At the conclusion of the show, the Boer general Christiaan de Wet would escape on horseback by leaping from a height of into a pool of water.

Admission ranged from 25 cents () for bleacher seats to one dollar () for box seats, and admission to the villages was another 25 cents. The concession cost $48,000 (equivalent to $ in ) to construct, grossed over $630,000 (equivalent to $ in ), and netted about $113,000 (equivalent to $ in ) to the fair—the highest-grossing military concession of the fair.

==Notable attendees==
The Louisiana World&#x27;s Fair was opened by President, Theodore Roosevelt, by telegraph, but he did not attend personally until after his reelection in November 1904, as he stated he did not wish to use the fair for political purposes. Attendees included John Philip Sousa, a musician, composer and conductor whose band performed on opening day and several times during the fair. Thomas Edison is claimed to have attended.

Ragtime music was popularly featured at the Fair. Scott Joplin wrote &quot;The Cascades&quot; specifically for the fair, inspired by the waterfalls at the Grand Basin, and presumably attended the fair.

Helen Keller, who was 24 and graduated from Radcliffe College, gave a lecture in the main auditorium.

J. T. Stinson, a well-regarded fruit specialist, introduced the phrase &quot;An apple a day keeps the doctor away&quot; (at a lecture during the exhibition).

The French organist Alexandre Guilmant played a series of 40 recitals from memory on the great organ in Festival Hall, then the largest pipe organ in the world, including &quot;Toccata in D minor&quot; (Op. 108, No. 1) by Albert Renaud, which Renaud had dedicated to Guilmant.

Geronimo, the former war chief of the Apache, was &quot;on display&quot; in a teepee in the Ethnology Exhibit.

Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th president, attended the opening ceremony on April 30 and &quot;overshadowed President Roosevelt in popular applause, when both stood on the same platform.&quot;

Henri Poincaré gave a keynote address on mathematical physics, including an outline for what would eventually become known as special relativity.

Jelly Roll Morton did not visit, stating in his later Library of Congress interview and recordings that he expected jazz pianist Tony Jackson would attend and win a jazz piano competition at the Exposition. Morton said he was &quot;quite disgusted&quot; to later learn that Jackson had not attended either, and that the competition had been won instead by Alfred Wilson; Morton considered himself a better pianist than Wilson.

The poet T. S. Eliot, who was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, visited the Igorot Village held in the Philippine Exposition section of the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair. Several months after the closing of the World&#x27;s Fair, he published a short story entitled &quot;The Man Who Was King&quot; in the school magazine of Smith Academy, St. Louis, Missouri, where he was a student. Inspired by the ganza dance that the Igorot people presented regularly in the Village and their reaction to &quot;civilization&quot;, the poet explored the interaction of a white man with the island culture. All this predates the poet&#x27;s delving into the anthropological studies during his Harvard graduate years.

Max Weber visited upon first coming to the United States in hopes of using some of his findings for a case study on capitalism.

Jack Daniel, the American distiller and the founder of Jack Daniel&#x27;s Tennessee whiskey distillery, entered his Tennessee whiskey into the World&#x27;s Fair whiskey competition. After four hours of deliberation, the eight judges awarded Jack Daniel&#x27;s Tennessee Whiskey the Gold Medal for the finest whiskey in the world. The award was a boon for the Jack Daniel&#x27;s distillery.

Novelist Kate Chopin lived nearby and purchased a season ticket to the fair. After her visit on the hot day of August 20, she suffered a brain hemorrhage and died two days later, on August 22, 1904.

Philadelphia mercantilist, John Wanamaker, visited the exposition in November 1904 and purchased an entire collection of German furniture which included the giant &quot;jugendstil&quot; brass sculpture of an eagle that he would display in the rotunda of his Wanamaker&#x27;s department store in Philadelphia. In 1909 Wanamaker also purchased the organ from the fair, which at the time was the biggest pipe organ in the world. It is still featured today, much enlarged, as the Wanamaker Organ in the Grand Court of his Philadelphia retail palace. Wanamaker purchased and donated an ancient Egyptian tomb, a mummy and other relics to the University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania.

Benedictine monk, artist and museum founder, Fr. Gregory Gerrer, OSB, exhibited his recent portrait of Pope Pius X at the fair. Following the fair, Gerrer brought the painting to Shawnee, Oklahoma, where it is now on display at the Mabee-Gerrer Museum of Art.

John McCormack, Irish tenor, was brought to the fair by James A. Reardon, who was in charge of the Irish exhibit.

The Sundance Kid visited the exposition, accompanied by Etta Place.

==Commemoration==
In conjunction with the Exposition the US Post Office issued a series of five commemorative stamps celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Louisiana Purchase. The 1-cent value portrays Robert Livingston, the ambassador who negotiated the purchase with France; the 2-cent value depicts Thomas Jefferson, who executed the purchase; the 3-cent honors James Monroe, who participated in negotiations with the French; the 5-cent memorializes William McKinley, who was involved with early plans for the Exposition; and the 10-cent presents a map of the Louisiana Purchase.

<doc id="50277" wikidata="Q1054478" url="?curid=50277" title="Century 21 Exposition">
<text>The Century 21 Exposition (also known as the Seattle World&#x27;s Fair) was a world&#x27;s fair held April 21, 1962, to October 21, 1962, in Seattle, Washington, United States. Nearly 10 million people attended the fair during its six-month run.

As planned, the exposition left behind a fairground and numerous public buildings and public works; some credit it with revitalizing Seattle&#x27;s economic and cultural life (&quot;see History of Seattle (1940–present)&quot;). The fair saw the construction of the Space Needle and Alweg monorail, as well as several sports venues (Washington State Coliseum, now Climate Pledge Arena) and performing arts buildings (the Playhouse, now the Cornish Playhouse), most of which have since been replaced or heavily remodeled. Unlike some other world&#x27;s fairs of its era, Century 21 made a profit.
The site, slightly expanded since the fair, is now called the Seattle Center; the United States Science Pavilion is now Pacific Science Center. Another notable Seattle Center building, the Museum of Pop Culture (earlier called EMP Museum), was built nearly 40 years later and designed to fit in with the fairground atmosphere.

==Planning and funding==
Seattle mayor Allan Pomeroy is credited with bringing the World&#x27;s Fair to the city. He recruited community and business leaders, as well as running a petition campaign, in the early 1950s to convince the city council to approve an $8.5 million bond issue to build the opera house and sports center needed to attract the fair. Eventually the council approved a $7.5 million bond issue with the state of Washington matching that amount.

==Cold War and Space Race context==
The fair was originally conceived at a Washington Athletic Club luncheon in 1955 to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1909 Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition, but it soon became clear that that date was too ambitious. With the Space Race underway and Boeing having &quot;put Seattle on the map&quot; as &quot;an aerospace city&quot;, a major theme of the fair was to show that &quot;the United States was not really &#x27;behind&#x27; the Soviet Union in the realms of science and space&quot;. As a result, the themes of space, science, and the future completely trumped the earlier conception of a &quot;Festival of the [American] West&quot;.

In June 1960, the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) certified Century 21 as a world&#x27;s fair. Project manager Ewen Dingwall went to Moscow to request Soviet participation, but was turned down. Neither the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Vietnam nor North Korea were invited.

As it happened, the Cold War had an additional effect on the fair. President John F. Kennedy was supposed to attend the closing ceremony of the fair on October 21, 1962. He bowed out, pleading a &quot;heavy cold&quot;; it later became public that he was dealing with the Cuban Missile Crisis.

The fair&#x27;s vision of the future displayed a technologically based optimism that did not anticipate any dramatic social change, one rooted in the 1950s rather than in the cultural tides that would emerge in the 1960s. Affluence, automation, consumerism, and American power would grow; social equity would simply take care of itself on a rising tide of abundance; the human race would master nature through technology rather than view it in terms of ecology. In contrast, 12 years later—even in far more conservative Spokane, Washington—Expo &#x27;74 took environmentalism as its central theme. The theme of Spokane&#x27;s Expo &#x27;74 was &quot;Celebrating Tomorrow&#x27;s Fresh New Environment.&quot;.

==Buildings and grounds==

Once the fair idea was conceived, several sites were considered. Among the sites considered within Seattle were Duwamish Head in West Seattle; Fort Lawton (now Discovery Park) in the Magnolia neighborhood; and First Hill—even closer to Downtown than the site finally selected, but far more densely developed. Two sites south of the city proper were considered—Midway, near Des Moines, and the Army Depot in Auburn—as was a site east of the city on the south shore of Lake Sammamish.

The site finally selected for the Century 21 Exposition had originally been contemplated for a civic center. The idea of using it for the world&#x27;s fair came later and brought in federal money for the United States Science Pavilion (now Pacific Science Center) and state money for the Washington State Coliseum (later Seattle Center Coliseum; renamed KeyArena in 1993 after the city sold naming rights to KeyCorp, the company doing business as KeyBank; renamed Climate Pledge Arena in 2021 after naming rights were sold to Amazon.com, Inc). Some of the land had been donated to the city by James Osborne in 1881 and by David and Louisa Denny in 1889. Two lots at Third Avenue N. and John Street were purchased from St. Demetrios Greek Orthodox Church, who had been planning to build a new church building there; the church used the proceeds to purchase land in the Montlake neighborhood. The Warren Avenue School, a public elementary school with several programs for physically handicapped students, was torn down, its programs dispersed, and provided most of the site of the Coliseum (now Climate Pledge Arena). Near the school, some of the city&#x27;s oldest houses, apartments, and commercial buildings were torn down; they had been run down to the point of being known as the &quot;Warren Avenue slum&quot;. The old Fire Station No. 4 was also sacrificed.

As early as the 1909 Bogue plan, this part of Lower Queen Anne had been considered for a civic center. The Civic Auditorium (later the Opera House, now McCaw Hall), the ice arena (later Mercer Arena), and the Civic Field (rebuilt in 1946 as the High School Memorial Stadium), all built in 1927 had been placed there based on that plan, as was an armory (the Food Circus during the fair, later Center House).

The fair planners also sought two other properties near the southwest corner of the grounds. They failed completely to make any inroads with the Seattle Archdiocese of the Roman Catholic Church, who had recently built Sacred Heart Church there; they did a bit better with the Freemasons&#x27; Nile Temple, which they were able to use for the duration of the fair and which then returned to its previous use. It served as the site of the Century 21 Club. This membership organization, formed especially for the fair, charged $250 for membership and offered lounge, dining room, and other club facilities, as well as a gate pass for the duration of the fair. The city ended up leasing the property after the fair and in 1977 bought it from the Masons. The building was eventually incorporated into a theater complex including the Seattle Children&#x27;s Theatre.

Paul Thiry was the fair&#x27;s chief architect; he also designed the Coliseum building. Among the other architects of the fair, Seattle-born Minoru Yamasaki received one of his first major commissions to build the United States Science Pavilion. Yamasaki would later design New York&#x27;s World Trade Center. Victor Steinbrueck and John Graham, Jr. designed the Space Needle. Hideki Shimizu and Kazuyuki Matsushita designed the original International Fountain. Despite the plan to build a permanent civic center, more than half the structures built for the fair were torn down more or less immediately after it ended. One attempt to conserve installations from Century 21 was the creation of a replica &quot;welcoming pole,&quot; a number of which originally stood tall over the southern entrance to the fair. This replica stood outside the Washington State Capital Museum until 1990, when it was taken down.

The grounds of the fair were divided into:
* World of Science
* World of Century 21 (also known as World of Tomorrow)
* World of Commerce and Industry
* World of Art
* World of Entertainment
* Show Street
* Gayway
* Boulevards of the World
* Exhibit Fair
* Food and Favors
* Food Circus
Besides the monorail, which survives , the fair also featured a Skyride that ran across the grounds from the Gayway to the International Mall. The bucket-like three-person cars were suspended from cables that rose as high as off the ground. The Skyride was moved to the Puyallup Fairgrounds in 1980.

=== World of Science ===

The World of Science centered on the United States Science Exhibit. It also included a NASA Exhibit that included models and mockups of various satellites, as well as the Project Mercury capsule that had carried Alan Shepard into space. These exhibits were the federal government&#x27;s major contribution to the fair.

The United States Science Exhibit began with Charles Eames&#x27; 10-minute short film &quot;The House of Science&quot;, followed by an exhibit on the development of science, ranging from mathematics and astronomy to atomic science and genetics. The Spacearium held up to 750 people at a time for a simulated voyage first through the Solar System and then through the Milky Way Galaxy and beyond. Further exhibits presented the scientific method and the &quot;horizons of science&quot;. This last looked at &quot;Science and the individual&quot;, &quot;Control of man&#x27;s physical surroundings&quot;, &quot;Science and the problem of world population&quot;, and &quot;Man&#x27;s concept of his place in an increasingly technological world&quot;.

===World of Century 21===
The Washington State Coliseum, financed by the state of Washington, was one of Thiry&#x27;s own architectural contributions to the fairgrounds. His original conception had been staging the entire fair under a single giant air-conditioned tent-like structure, &quot;a city of its own&quot;, but there were neither the budgets nor the tight agreements on concept to realize that vision. In the end, he got exactly enough of a budget to design and build a building suitable to hold a variety of exhibition spaces and equally suitable for later conversion to a sports arena and convention facility.
During the festival, the building hosted several exhibits. Nearly half of its surface area was occupied by the state&#x27;s own circular exhibit &quot;Century 21—The Threshold and the Threat&quot;, also known as the &quot;World of Tomorrow&quot; exhibit, billed as a &quot;21-minute tour of the future&quot;. The building also housed exhibits by France, Pan American World Airways (Pan Am), General Motors (GM), the American Library Association (ALA), and RCA, as well as a Washington state tourist center.

In &quot;The Threshold and the Threat&quot;, visitors rode a &quot;Bubbleator&quot; into the &quot;world of tomorrow&quot;. Music &quot;from another world&quot; and a shifting pattern of lights accompanied them on a 40-second upward journey to a starry space bathed in golden light. Then they were faced briefly with an image of a desperate family in a fallout shelter, which vanished and was replaced by a series of images reflecting the sweep of history, starting with the Acropolis and ending with an image of Marilyn Monroe.

Next, visitors were beckoned into a cluster of cubes containing a model of a &quot;city of the future&quot; (which a few landmarks clearly indicated as Seattle) and its suburban and rural surroundings, seen first by day and later by night. The next cluster of cubes zoomed in on a vision of a high-tech, future home in a sylvan setting (and a commuter gyrocopter); a series of projections contrasted this &quot;best of the future&quot; to &quot;the worst of the present&quot; (over-uniform suburbs, a dreary urban housing project).

The exhibit continued with a vision of future transportation (centered on a monorail and high-speed &quot;air cars&quot; on an electrically controlled highway). There was also an &quot;office of the future&quot;, a climate-controlled &quot;farm factory&quot;, an automated offshore kelp and plankton harvesting farm, a vision of the schools of the future with &quot;electronic storehouses of knowledge&quot;, and a vision of the many recreations that technology would free humans to pursue.

Finally, the tour ended with a symbolic sculptural tree and the reappearance of the family in the fallout shelter and the sound of a ticking clock, a brief silence, an extract from , followed by a further &quot;symphony of music and color&quot;.

Under the same roof, the ALA exhibited a &quot;library of the future&quot; (centered on a Univac computer). GM exhibited its vision for highways and vehicles of the future (the latter including the Firebird III). Pan Am exhibited a giant globe that emphasized the notion that we had come to be able to think of distances between major world cities in hours and minutes rather than in terms of chancy voyages over great distances. RCA (which produced &quot;The Threshold and the Threat&quot;) exhibited television, radio, and stereo technology, as well as its involvement in space. The French government had an exhibit with its own take on technological progress. Finally, a Washington state tourist center provided information for fair-goers wishing to tour the state.

===World of Commerce and Industry===
The World of Commerce and Industry was divided into domestic and foreign areas. The former was sited mainly south of American Way (the continuation of Thomas Street through the grounds), an area it shared with the World of Science. It included the Space Needle and what is now the Broad Street Green and Mural Amphitheater. The Hall of Industry and some smaller buildings were immediately north of American Way. The latter included 15 governmental exhibitors and surrounded the World of Tomorrow and extended to the north edge of the fair.

Among the features of Domestic Commerce and Industry, the massive Interiors, Fashion, and Commerce Building spread for —nearly the entire Broad Street side of the grounds—with exhibits ranging from 32 separate furniture companies to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. &quot;Vogue&quot; produced four fashion shows daily alongside a perfumed pool. The Ford Motor Company, in its pavilion, presented a simulated space flight and its vision for the car of the future, the Ford Seattle-ite XXI. The Electric Power Pavilion included a -high fountain made to look like a hydroelectric dam, with the entrance to the pavilion through a tunnel in said &quot;dam&quot;. The Forest Products Pavilion was surrounded by a grove of trees of various species, and included an all-wood theater and a Society of American Foresters exhibit. Standard Oil of California celebrated, among other things, the fact that the world&#x27;s first service station opened in Seattle in 1907. The fair&#x27;s Bell Telephone (now AT&amp;T Inc.) exhibit was featured in a short film called &quot;Century 21 Calling...&quot;, which was later shown on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;. There were also several religious pavilions. Near the center of all this was Seattle artist Paul Horiuchi&#x27;s massive mosaic mural, the region&#x27;s largest work of art at the time, which now forms the backdrop of Seattle Center&#x27;s Mural Amphitheater.

Foreign exhibits included a science and technology exhibit by Great Britain, while Mexico and Peru focused on handicrafts, and Japan and India attempted to show both of these sides of their national cultures. The Taiwan and South Korea pavilions showed their rapid industrialization to the world and the benefits of capitalism over communism during the time of cold war era. Other pavilions included one featuring Brazilian tea and coffee; a European Communities Pavilion from the then six countries of the European Economic Community; and a joint pavilion by those countries of Africa that had by then achieved independence. Sweden&#x27;s exhibit included the story of the salvaging of a 17th-century man-of-war from Stockholm harbor, and San Marino&#x27;s exhibit featured its postage stamps and pottery. Near the center of this was the DuPen Fountain featuring three sculptures by Seattle artist Everett DuPen.

===World of Art===

The Fine Arts Pavilion (later the Exhibition Hall) brought together an art exhibition unprecedented for the West Coast of the United States. Among the 50 contemporary American painters whose works shown were Josef Albers, Willem de Kooning, Helen Frankenthaler, Philip Guston, Jasper Johns, Joan Mitchell, Robert Motherwell, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, Jackson Pollock, Robert Rauschenberg, Ad Reinhardt, Ben Shahn, and Frank Stella, as well as Northwest painters Kenneth Callahan, Morris Graves, Paul Horiuchi, and Mark Tobey. American sculptors included Leonard Baskin, Alexander Calder, Joseph Cornell, Louise Nevelson, Isamu Noguchi, and 19 others. The 50 international contemporary artists represented included the likes of painters Fritz Hundertwasser, Joan Miró, Antoni Tàpies, and Francis Bacon, and sculptors Henry Moore and Jean Arp. In addition, there were exhibitions of Mark Tobey&#x27;s paintings and of Asian art, drawn from the collections of the Seattle Art Museum; and an additional exhibition of 72 &quot;masterpieces&quot; ranging from Titian, El Greco, Caravaggio, Rembrandt, and Rubens through Toulouse-Lautrec, Monet, and Turner to Klee, Braque, and Picasso, with no shortage of other comparably famous artists represented.
A separate gallery presented Northwest Coast Indian art, and featured a series of large paintings by Bill Holm introducing Northwest Native motifs.

===World of Entertainment===
A US$15 million performing-arts program at the fair ranged from a boxing championship to an international twirling competition but with no shortage of nationally and internationally famous performers, especially at the new Opera House and Playhouse. After the fair, the Playhouse became the Seattle Repertory Theatre; in the mid-1980s it became the Intiman Playhouse. When the Intiman Theatre became financially unstable, Cornish College of the Arts took over the lease from the city of Seattle, and now operates it as the Cornish Playhouse at Seattle Center.

====Opera House performances====
Scheduled groups performing at the Opera House included:


====Other performances====

Events and performances at the Playhouse included Sweden&#x27;s Royal Dramatic Theatre; a chamber music performance by Isaac Stern, Milton Katims, Leonard Rose, Eugene Istomin, the Claiborne Brothers gospel quartet, and the Juilliard String Quartet; two appearances by newsman Edward R. Murrow; Bunraku theater; Richard Dyer-Bennet; Hal Holbrook&#x27;s solo show as Mark Twain; the Count Basie and Benny Goodman jazz orchestras; Lawrence Welk; Nat King Cole; and Ella Fitzgerald. Also during the fair, Memorial Stadium hosted the Ringling Brothers Circus, Tommy Bartlett&#x27;s Water Ski Sky and Stage Show, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans&#x27; Western Show, and an appearance by evangelist Billy Graham.

The fair and the city were the setting of the Elvis Presley movie &quot;It Happened at the World&#x27;s Fair&quot; (1963), with a young Kurt Russell making his first screen appearance. Location shooting began on September 4 and concluded nearly two weeks later. The film would be released the following spring, long after the fair had ended.

===Show Street===
At the northeast corner of the grounds (now the KCTS-TV studios), Show Street was the &quot;adult entertainment&quot; portion of the fair. Attractions included Gracie Hansen&#x27;s Paradise International (a Vegas-style floor show (rivalled next door by LeRoy Prinz&#x27;s &quot;Backstage USA&quot;)), Sid and Marty Krofft&#x27;s adults-only puppet show, &quot;Les Poupées de Paris&quot;, and (briefly, until it was shut down) a show featuring naked &quot;Girls of the Galaxy&quot;. Tamer entertainment came in forms such as the Paris Spectacular wax museum, an elaborate Japanese Village, and the Hawaiian Pavilion.

===Other sections of the fair===

;Gayway: The Gayway was a small amusement park; after the fair it became the Fun Forest. It included such rides as the Flight to Mars, a dark amusement ride themed around space pirates on Mars, decorated with black lights and glow paint. In 2011, the Fun Forest was shut down and the Chihuly Garden and Glass opened in its place.
;Boulevards of the World: Boulevards of the World was &quot;the shopping center of the fair&quot;. It also included the Plaza of the States and the original version of the International Fountain.
;Exhibit Fair: The Exhibit Fair provided another shopping district under the north stands of Memorial Stadium.
;Food and Favors: &quot;Food and Favors&quot;, officially one of the &quot;areas&quot; of the fair, simply encompassed the various restaurants, food stands, etc., scattered throughout the grounds. These ranged from vending machines and food stands to the Eye of the Needle (atop the Space Needle) and the private Century 21 Club.
;Food Circus: The Food Circus was a food court in the former armory, later named the Center House, and renamed the Armory in 2012 as a remodel of the building continues. Unlike the current arrangement with a stage and a large open space for dancing, events, and temporary booths, many food booths were in the middle of the room as well as at the edges. There were 52 concessionaires in all, nine of them with exhibits in addition to their food for sale. Beginning in 1963, the Food Circus also housed a variety of museums, including Jones&#x27; Fantastic Show, the Jules Charbneau World of Miniatures, and the Pullen Klondike Museum.
