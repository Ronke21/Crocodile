<text>A bomb is an explosive weapon that uses the exothermic reaction of an explosive material to provide an extremely sudden and violent release of energy. Detonations inflict damage principally through ground- and atmosphere-transmitted mechanical stress, the impact and penetration of pressure-driven projectiles, pressure damage, and explosion-generated effects. Bombs have been utilized since the 11th century starting in East Asia.

The term &quot;bomb&quot; is not usually applied to explosive devices used for civilian purposes such as construction or mining, although the people using the devices may sometimes refer to them as a &quot;bomb&quot;. The military use of the term &quot;bomb&quot;, or more specifically aerial bomb action, typically refers to airdropped, unpowered explosive weapons most commonly used by air forces and naval aviation. Other military explosive weapons not classified as &quot;bombs&quot; include shells, depth charges (used in water), or land mines. In unconventional warfare, other names can refer to a range of offensive weaponry. For instance, in recent asymmetric conflicts, homemade bombs called &quot;improvised explosive devices&quot; (IEDs) have been employed by irregular forces to great effectiveness.

The word comes from the Latin , which in turn comes from the Greek romanized , an onomatopoetic term meaning &#x27;booming&#x27;, &#x27;buzzing&#x27;.
==History==


Gunpowder bombs had been mentioned since the 11th century. In 1000 AD, a soldier by the name of Tang Fu (唐福) demonstrated a design of gunpowder pots (a proto-bomb which spews fire) and gunpowder caltrops, for which he was richly rewarded. In the same year, Xu Dong wrote that trebuchets used bombs that were like &quot;flying fire&quot;, suggesting that they were incendiaries. In the military text &quot;Wujing Zongyao&quot; of 1044, bombs such as the &quot;ten-thousand fire flying sand magic bomb&quot;, &quot;burning heaven fierce fire unstoppable bomb&quot;, and &quot;thunderclap bomb&quot; (&quot;pilipao&quot;) were mentioned. However these were soft-shell bombs and did not use metal casings.

Bombs made of cast iron shells packed with explosive gunpowder date to 13th century China. Explosive bombs were used in East Asia in 1221, by a Jurchen Jin army against a Chinese Song city. The term for this explosive bomb seems to have been coined the &quot;thunder crash bomb&quot; during a Jin dynasty (1115–1234) naval battle in 1231 against the Mongols. 

The &quot;History of Jin&quot; (金史) (compiled by 1345) states that in 1232, as the Mongol general Subutai (1176–1248) descended on the Jin stronghold of Kaifeng, the defenders had a &quot;thunder crash bomb&quot; which &quot;consisted of gunpowder put into an iron container ... then when the fuse was lit (and the projectile shot off) there was a great explosion the noise whereof was like thunder, audible for more than thirty miles, and the vegetation was scorched and blasted by the heat over an area of more than half a &quot;mou&quot;. When hit, even iron armour was quite pierced through.&quot; 

The Song Dynasty (960–1279) official Li Zengbo wrote in 1257 that arsenals should have several hundred thousand iron bomb shells available and that when he was in Jingzhou, about one to two thousand were produced each month for dispatch of ten to twenty thousand at a time to Xiangyang and Yingzhou. The Ming Dynasty text &quot;Huolongjing&quot; describes the use of poisonous gunpowder bombs, including the &quot;wind-and-dust&quot; bomb.

During the Mongol invasions of Japan, the Mongols used the explosive &quot;thunder-crash bombs&quot; against the Japanese. Archaeological evidence of the &quot;thunder-crash bombs&quot; has been discovered in an underwater shipwreck off the shore of Japan by the Kyushu Okinawa Society for Underwater Archaeology. X-rays by Japanese scientists of the excavated shells confirmed that they contained gunpowder.

==Shock==
Explosive shock waves can cause situations such as body displacement (i.e., people being thrown through the air), dismemberment, internal bleeding and ruptured eardrums.

Shock waves produced by explosive events have two distinct components, the positive and negative wave. The positive wave shoves outward from the point of detonation, followed by the trailing vacuum space &quot;sucking back&quot; towards the point of origin as the shock bubble collapses. The greatest defense against shock injuries is distance from the source of shock. As a point of reference, the overpressure at the Oklahoma City bombing was estimated in the range of 

==Heat==
A thermal wave is created by the sudden release of heat caused by an explosion. Military bomb tests have documented temperatures of up to 2,480 °C (4,500 °F). While capable of inflicting severe to catastrophic burns and causing secondary fires, thermal wave effects are considered very limited in range compared to shock and fragmentation. This rule has been challenged, however, by military development of thermobaric weapons, which employ a combination of negative shock wave effects and extreme temperature to incinerate objects within the blast radius.

==Fragmentation==
Fragmentation is produced by the acceleration of shattered pieces of bomb casing and adjacent physical objects. The use of fragmentation in bombs dates to the 14th century, and appears in the Ming Dynasty text &quot;Huolongjing&quot;. The fragmentation bombs were filled with iron pellets and pieces of broken porcelain. Once the bomb explodes, the resulting fragments are capable of piercing the skin and blinding enemy soldiers.

While conventionally viewed as small metal shards moving at super-supersonic and hypersonic speeds, fragmentation can occur in epic proportions and travel for extensive distances. When the SS &quot;Grandcamp&quot; exploded in the Texas City Disaster on April 16, 1947, one fragment of that blast was a two-ton anchor which was hurled nearly two miles inland to embed itself in the parking lot of the Pan American refinery.

==Effects on living things==
To people who are close to a blast incident, such as bomb disposal technicians, soldiers wearing body armor, deminers, or individuals wearing little to no protection, there are four types of blast effects on the human body: overpressure (shock), fragmentation, impact, and heat. Overpressure refers to the sudden and drastic rise in ambient pressure that can damage the internal organs, possibly leading to permanent damage or death. Fragmentation can also include sand, debris and vegetation from the area surrounding the blast source. This is very common in anti-personnel mine blasts. The projection of materials poses a potentially lethal threat caused by cuts in soft tissues, as well as infections, and injuries to the internal organs. When the overpressure wave impacts the body it can induce violent levels of blast-induced acceleration. Resulting injuries may range from minor to unsurvivable. Immediately following this initial acceleration, deceleration injuries can occur when a person impacts directly against a rigid surface or obstacle after being set in motion by the force of the blast. Finally, injury and fatality can result from the explosive fireball as well as incendiary agents projected onto the body. Personal protective equipment, such as a bomb suit or demining ensemble, as well as helmets, visors and foot protection, can dramatically reduce the four effects, depending upon the charge, proximity and other variables.

==Types==


Experts commonly distinguish between civilian and military bombs. The latter are almost always mass-produced weapons, developed and constructed to a standard design out of standard components and intended to be deployed in a standard explosive device. IEDs are divided into three basic categories by basic size and delivery. Type 76, IEDs are hand-carried parcel or suitcase bombs, type 80, are &quot;suicide vests&quot; worn by a bomber, and type 3 devices are vehicles laden with explosives to act as large-scale stationary or self-propelled bombs, also known as VBIED (vehicle-borne IEDs).

Improvised explosive materials are typically unstable and subject to spontaneous, unintentional detonation triggered by a wide range of environmental effects, ranging from impact and friction to electrostatic shock. Even subtle motion, change in temperature, or the nearby use of cellphones or radios can trigger an unstable or remote-controlled device. Any interaction with explosive materials or devices by unqualified personnel should be considered a grave and immediate risk of death or dire injury. The safest response to finding an object believed to be an explosive device is to get as far away from it as possible.

Atomic bombs are based on the theory of nuclear fission, that when a large atom splits, it releases a massive amount of energy. Thermonuclear weapons, (colloquially known as &quot;hydrogen bombs&quot;) use the energy from an initial fission explosion to create an even more powerful fusion explosion.

The term &quot;dirty bomb&quot; refers to a specialized device that relies on a comparatively low explosive yield to scatter harmful material over a wide area. Most commonly associated with radiological or chemical materials, dirty bombs seek to kill or injure and then to deny access to a contaminated area until a thorough clean-up can be accomplished. In the case of urban settings, this clean-up may take extensive time, rendering the contaminated zone virtually uninhabitable in the interim.

The power of large bombs is typically measured in kilotons (kt) or megatons of TNT (Mt). The most powerful bombs ever used in combat were the two atomic bombs dropped by the United States to attack Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the most powerful ever tested was the Tsar Bomba. The most powerful non-nuclear bomb is Russian &quot;Father of All Bombs&quot; (officially Aviation Thermobaric Bomb of Increased Power (ATBIP)) followed by the United States Air Force&#x27;s MOAB (officially Massive Ordnance Air Blast, or more commonly known as the &quot;Mother of All Bombs&quot;).

Below is a list of five different types of bombs based on the fundamental explosive mechanism they employ.

===Compressed gas===
Relatively small explosions can be produced by pressurizing a container until catastrophic failure such as with a dry ice bomb. Technically, devices that create explosions of this type can not be classified as &quot;bombs&quot; by the definition presented at the top of this article. However, the explosions created by these devices can cause property damage, injury, or death. Flammable liquids, gasses and gas mixtures dispersed in these explosions may also ignite if exposed to a spark or flame.

===Low explosive===
The simplest and oldest bombs store energy in the form of a low explosive. Black powder is an example of a low explosive. Low explosives typically consist of a mixture of an oxidizing salt, such as potassium nitrate (saltpeter), with solid fuel, such as charcoal or aluminium powder. These compositions deflagrate upon ignition, producing hot gas. Under normal circumstances, this deflagration occurs too slowly to produce a significant pressure wave; low explosives, therefore, must generally be used in large quantities or confined in a container with a high burst pressure to be useful as a bomb.

===High explosive===
A high explosive bomb is one that employs a process called &quot;detonation&quot; to rapidly go from an initially high energy molecule to a very low energy molecule. Detonation is distinct from deflagration in that the chemical reaction propagates faster than the speed of sound (often many times faster) in an intense shock wave. Therefore, the pressure wave produced by a high explosive is not significantly increased by confinement as detonation occurs so quickly that the resulting plasma does not expand much before all the explosive material has reacted. This has led to the development of plastic explosive. A casing is still employed in some high explosive bombs, but with the purpose of fragmentation. Most high explosive bombs consist of an insensitive secondary explosive that must be detonated with a blasting cap containing a more sensitive primary explosive.

===Thermobaric===
A thermobaric bomb is a type of explosive that utilizes oxygen from the surrounding air to generate an intense, high-temperature explosion, and in practice the blast wave typically produced by such a weapon is of a significantly longer duration than that produced by a conventional condensed explosive. The fuel-air bomb is one of the best-known types of thermobaric weapons.

===Nuclear fission===
Nuclear fission type atomic bombs utilize the energy present in very heavy atomic nuclei, such as U-235 or Pu-239. In order to release this energy rapidly, a certain amount of the fissile material must be very rapidly consolidated while being exposed to a neutron source. If consolidation occurs slowly, repulsive forces drive the material apart before a significant explosion can occur. Under the right circumstances, rapid consolidation can provoke a chain reaction that can proliferate and intensify by many orders of magnitude within microseconds. The energy released by a nuclear fission bomb may be tens of thousands of times greater than a chemical bomb of the same mass.

===Nuclear fusion===
A thermonuclear weapon is a type of nuclear bomb that releases energy through the combination of fission and fusion of the light atomic nuclei of deuterium and tritium. With this type of bomb, a thermonuclear detonation is triggered by the detonation of a fission type nuclear bomb contained within a material containing high concentrations of deuterium and tritium. Weapon yield is typically increased with a tamper that increases the duration and intensity of the reaction through inertial confinement and neutron reflection. Nuclear fusion bombs can have arbitrarily high yields making them hundreds or thousands of times more powerful than nuclear fission.

A pure fusion weapon is a hypothetical nuclear weapon that does not require a primary fission stage to start a fusion reaction.

===Antimatter===

Antimatter bombs can theoretically be constructed, but antimatter is very costly to produce and hard to store safely.

===Other===
* Aerial bomb – designed to be dropped from a military aircraft (or even any aircraft) and carried on hardpoints or in bomb bays
* Delay-action bomb – explodes some time after impact, as opposed to before or on impact
* Dummy bomb – harmless bomb that has been fully disabled or has had its explosive contents removed, often used for training or display
* Glide bomb – features flight control surfaces, allowing it to glide fairly long distances to its target
* General-purpose bomb – aerial bomb dropped for multiple purposes, and thus designed to suit multiple purposes
* Incendiary bomb – designed to set targets ablaze
* Cluster bomb – releases additional submunitions, often smaller bombs, upon detonation
* Anti-runway penetration bomb – designed to destroy runways and aprons
* Bunker buster – capable of penetrating hardened or fortified surfaces before detonating
* Concrete bomb – contains dense, inert material (typically concrete) instead of explosives, using the kinetic energy of the falling bomb to destroy target
* Improvised explosive device – classification of bombs produced in unconventional ways or using unconventional materials; includes explosives such as the barrel bomb, nail bomb, pipe bomb, pressure cooker bomb, fertilizer bomb, and Molotov cocktail
==Delivery==

The first air-dropped bombs were used by the Austrians in the 1849 siege of Venice. Two hundred unmanned balloons carried small bombs, although few bombs actually hit the city.

The first bombing from a fixed-wing aircraft took place in 1911 when the Italians dropped bombs by hand on the Turkish lines in what is now Libya, during the Italo-Turkish War. The first large scale dropping of bombs took place during World War I starting in 1915 with the German Zeppelin airship raids on London, England, and the same war saw the invention of the first heavy bombers. One Zeppelin raid on 8 September 1915 dropped of high explosives and incendiary bombs, including one bomb that weighed .

During World War II bombing became a major military feature, and a number of novel delivery methods were introduced. These included Barnes Wallis&#x27;s bouncing bomb, designed to bounce across water, avoiding torpedo nets and other underwater defenses, until it reached a dam, ship, or other destination, where it would sink and explode. By the end of the war, planes such as the allied forces&#x27; Avro Lancaster were delivering with accuracy from , ten ton earthquake bombs (also invented by Barnes Wallis) named &quot;Grand Slam&quot;, which, unusually for the time, were delivered from high altitude in order to gain high speed, and would, upon impact, penetrate and explode deep underground (&quot;camouflet&quot;), causing massive caverns or craters, and affecting targets too large or difficult to be affected by other types of bomb.

Modern military bomber aircraft are designed around a large-capacity internal bomb bay, while fighter-bombers usually carry bombs externally on pylons or bomb racks or on multiple ejection racks, which enable mounting several bombs on a single pylon. Some bombs are equipped with a parachute, such as the World War II &quot;parafrag&quot; (an fragmentation bomb), the Vietnam War-era daisy cutters, and the bomblets of some modern cluster bombs. Parachutes slow the bomb&#x27;s descent, giving the dropping aircraft time to get to a safe distance from the explosion. This is especially important with air-burst nuclear weapons (especially those dropped from slower aircraft or with very high yields), and in situations where the aircraft releases a bomb at low altitude. A number of modern bombs are also precision-guided munitions, and may be guided after they leave an aircraft by remote control, or by autonomous guidance.

Aircraft may also deliver bombs in the form of warheads on guided missiles, such as long-range cruise missiles, which can also be launched from warships.

A hand grenade is delivered by being thrown. Grenades can also be projected by other means, such as being launched from the muzzle of a rifle (as in the rifle grenade), using a grenade launcher (such as the M203), or by attaching a rocket to the explosive grenade (as in a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG)).

A bomb may also be positioned in advance and concealed.

A bomb destroying a rail track just before a train arrives will usually cause the train to derail. In addition to the damage to vehicles and people, a bomb exploding in a transport network often damages, and is sometimes mainly intended to damage, the network itself. This applies to railways, bridges, runways, and ports, and, to a lesser extent (depending on circumstances), to roads.

In the case of suicide bombing, the bomb is often carried by the attacker on their body, or in a vehicle driven to the target.

The Blue Peacock nuclear mines, which were also termed &quot;bombs&quot;, were planned to be positioned during wartime and be constructed such that, if disturbed, they would explode within ten seconds.

The explosion of a bomb may be triggered by a detonator or a fuse. Detonators are triggered by clocks, remote controls like cell phones or some kind of sensor, such as pressure (altitude), radar, vibration or contact. Detonators vary in ways they work, they can be electrical, fire fuze or blast initiated detonators and others,

==Blast seat==
In forensic science, the point of detonation of a bomb is referred to as its blast seat, seat of explosion, blast hole or epicenter. Depending on the type, quantity and placement of explosives, the blast seat may be either spread out or concentrated (i.e., an explosion crater).

Other types of explosions, such as dust or vapor explosions, do not cause craters or even have definitive blast seats.

<text>Atil, also Itil, was the capital of the Khazar Khaganate from the mid-8th century to the late 10th century. It is known historically to have been situated along the Silk Road, on the northern coast of the Caspian Sea, in the Volga Delta region of modern Southern Russia. Its precise location has long been unknown.

In 2008 a Russian archaeologist claimed to have discovered the remains of Atil in Samosdelka, a village in the Volga Delta approximately 30 km southwest of the city of Astrakhan. This claim has since been disproven.

==Name==
The historical Turkic peoples living on or near the Volga region called both the river and the Khazar capital city on the river or &quot;Atil&quot;.

Modern Turkic languages have retained the historical name for the Volga. The Volga is known as &quot; İdel &quot;( Идел) in Tatar, as &quot; Atăl &quot; (Атӑл) in Chuvash, as &quot; Iźelin &quot; in Bashkir, as &quot; Edıl &quot; in Kazakh, and as &quot; İdil &quot; in Turkish. The origin and meaning of the ancient Turkic form &quot;/&quot; are uncertain.

==History and description==
Atil was located along the Volga delta at the northwestern corner of the Caspian Sea. Following the defeat of the Khazars in the Second Arab-Khazar War, Atil became the capital of Khazaria.

Ibn Khordadbeh, writing in ca. 870, names &quot;Khamlij&quot; as the capital of the Khazars. This is presumably a rendition of Turkic &quot;khaganbaligh&quot; &quot;city of the khan&quot; and refers to the city later (in the 10th century) named as &quot;Atil&quot; in Arab historiography.

At its height, the city was a major center of trade. It consisted of three parts separated by the Volga. The western part contained the administrative center of the city, with a court house and a large military garrison. The eastern part of the city was built later and acted as the commercial center of the Atil, and had many public baths and shops. Between them was an island on which stood the palaces of the Khazar Khagan and Bek. The island was connected to one of the other parts of the city by a pontoon bridge. 
According to Arab sources of the 10th century, one half of the city was referred to as Atil, while the other was named Khazaran.

Atil was a multi-ethnic and religiously diverse city, inhabited by Jews, Christians, Muslims, Shamanists, and Pagans, many of them traders from foreign countries. All of the religious groups had their own places of worship in the city, and there were seven judges appointed to settle disputes (two Christian, two Jewish, and two Muslim judges, with a single judge for all of the Shamanists and other Pagans). The numerous Christians of Atil were under the jurisdiction of their own bishop; the minaret of the Friday mosque of the Muslims of Atil is said to have been higher than the castle.

The city was a major trade center, and managed the Khazar slave trade, in which slaves bought for export were transported from the Khazar Khaganate to either the Black Sea slave trade in the West via the Black Sea port of Kerch, or East from the capital of Atil via the Caspian Sea to Central Asia and from there to slavery in the Abbasid Caliphate.

Svyatoslav I of Kiev sacked Atil in 968 or 969 CE. Ibn Hawqal and al-Muqaddasi refer to Atil after 969, indicating that it may have been rebuilt. Al-Biruni (mid-11th century) reported that Atil was again in ruins, and did not mention the later city of Saqsin which was built nearby, so it is possible that this new Atil was only destroyed in the middle of the 11th century.

==The search for archaeological remains==

As of 2024, the archaeological remains of Atil have not been positively identified. An accepted hypothesis is that they were washed away by the rising level of the Caspian Sea.

===Samosdelka site===
In September 2008, Russian archaeologists excavating in the Volga Delta fishing village of Samosdelka announced their discovery of what they claimed were the remains of Atil. A 2020 assessment by the Russian Geographic Society concluded that Atil had not been found in Samosdelka, and announced that new excavations were underway at another site.

===Semibugry site===
The archaeological remains of a settlement from the Khazar period near the village of Semibugry (Russian: Семибугры) in the central part of the Volga Delta were discovered after Samosdelka and as of 2020 were being excavated in the hopes that the settlement was Atil. According to historian Alex Feldman, &quot;it remains impossible to archaeologically prove&quot; the location of Atil.

<text>Paella (, , , , ; ) is a rice dish originally from the Valencian Community. &quot;Paella&quot; is regarded as one of the community&#x27;s identifying symbols. It is one of the best-known dishes in Spanish cuisine.

The dish takes its name from the wide, shallow traditional pan used to cook the dish on an open fire, &quot;paella&quot; being the word for a frying pan in Valencian/Catalan language. As a dish, it may have ancient roots, but in its modern form, it is traced back to the mid-19th century, in the rural area around the Albufera lagoon adjacent to the city of Valencia, on the Mediterranean coast of Spain.

Paella valenciana is the traditional paella of the Valencia region, believed to be the original recipe, and consists of Valencian rice, olive oil, rabbit, chicken, saffron or a substitute, tomato, ferradura or flat green bean, lima beans (Phaseolus lunatus), salt and water. The dish is sometimes seasoned with whole rosemary branches. Traditionally, the yellow color comes from saffron, but turmeric and &quot;Calendula&quot; can be used as substitutes. Artichoke hearts and stems may be used as seasonal ingredients. Most paella cooks use bomba rice, but a cultivar known as &quot;senia&quot; is also used in the Valencia region.

Paella de marisco (seafood &quot;paella&quot;) replaces meat with seafood and omits beans and green vegetables, while paella mixta (mixed &quot;paella&quot;) combines meat from livestock, seafood, vegetables, and sometimes beans, with the traditional rice.

Other popular local variations of &quot;paella&quot; are cooked throughout the Mediterranean area, the rest of Spain, and internationally. In Spain, &quot;paella&quot; is traditionally included in restaurant menus on Thursdays.

== History ==

=== Possible origins ===

Muslims in Al-Andalus began rice cultivation around the 10th century. Consequently, eastern Iberian Peninsula locals often made casseroles of rice, fish, and spices for family gatherings and religious feasts, thus establishing the custom of eating rice in Spain. This led to rice becoming a staple by the 15th century. Afterward, it became customary for cooks to combine rice with vegetables, beans, and dry cod, providing an acceptable meal for Lent. Along Spain&#x27;s Mediterranean coast, rice was predominantly eaten with fish.

Spanish food historian Lourdes March notes that the dish &quot;symbolizes the union and heritage of two important cultures, the Roman, which gives us the utensil and the Arab which brought us the basic food of humanity for centuries: rice.&quot;
===Naming, etymology and &quot;paellera&quot;===

&quot;Paella&quot; is a Valencian word that means frying pan, from which the dish gets its name. Valencian speakers use the word &quot;paella&quot; for all pans, including the traditional shallow pan used for cooking the homonym dish. The pan is made of polished or coated steel with two side handles.&quot;&quot;

In many regions of Spain and other Spanish-speaking countries, the term &quot;paellera&quot; may be used for the traditional pan, while &quot;paella&quot; is reserved for the rice dish prepared in it. Both &quot;paella&quot; and &quot;paellera&quot; are correct terms for the pan.

According to the etymologist Joan Coromines, the Catalan word &quot;paella&quot; derives from the Old French word &quot;paelle&quot; for frying pan, which in turn comes from the Latin word &quot;patella&quot; for pan; he thinks that otherwise the word should be &quot;padella&quot;, as inter-vowel -d- dropping is not typical of Old Catalan.

The word &quot;paella&quot; is also related to &quot;paila&quot; used in many Latin American countries. &quot;Paila&quot; in Latin American Spanish refers to a variety of cookware resembling metal and clay pans, which are also used for both cooking and serving.

The Latin root &quot;patella&quot; from which &quot;paella&quot; derives is also akin to the modern French &quot;poêle&quot;, the Italian &quot;padella&quot;, and the Old Spanish &quot;padilla&quot;.

Some claim that the word &quot;paella&quot; comes from the Arabic , pronounced &quot;baqaayya&quot;, meaning &quot;leftovers.&quot; This claim is based on the 8th-century custom in which Moorish kings&#x27; servants would take home the rice, chicken, and vegetables their employers left at the end of the meal. It has been said, however, that a problem with this etymology is that the word &quot;paella&quot; is not attested until six centuries after Moorish Valencia was conquered by James I.

===&quot;Paella valenciana&quot;===
Originally, paella made in Valencia was a lunchtime meal for farmers and farm laborers. Workers would gather what was available to them around the rice fields. This often included tomatoes, onions, and snails. Rabbit or duck was a common addition, or chicken less often.

On special occasions, 18th-century Valencians used &quot;calderos&quot; to cook the rice in the open air of their orchards near lake Albufera. Water vole meat was one of the main ingredients of early paellas, along with eel and butter beans. Novelist Vicente Blasco Ibáñez described the Valencia custom of eating water voles in &quot;Cañas y Barro&quot; (1902), a realistic novel about life among the fishermen and peasants near lake Albufera.

Living standards rose with the sociological changes of the late 19th century in Spain, giving rise to gatherings and outings in the countryside. This led to a change in paella&#x27;s ingredients, as well, using instead rabbit, chicken, duck, and sometimes snails. The dish became so popular that in 1840, a local Spanish newspaper first used the word &quot;paella&quot; to refer to the recipe rather than the pan, according to food historian Lynne Olver.

The most widely used, complete ingredient list of this era was: short-grain white rice, chicken, rabbit, snails (optional), duck (optional), butter beans, great northern beans, runner beans, artichoke (a substitute for runner beans in the winter), tomatoes, fresh rosemary, sweet paprika, saffron, garlic (optional), salt, olive oil, and water. Poorer Valencians sometimes used only snails for meat. Many Valencians insist that no more than these ingredients should go into making modern &quot;paella valenciana&quot;, and, in particular, that fish and shellfish are &quot;absolutely out of the question.&quot; Another important rule, according to Valencians, is that fresh rosemary should not be added to &quot;paella valenciana&quot; made with rosemary-eating snails.

===Seafood and mixed &quot;paella&quot;===
On the Mediterranean coast, Valencian fishermen used seafood instead of meat and beans to make paella. In this recipe, the seafood is served in the shell. Later, Spaniards living outside of Valencia combined seafood with meat from land animals, and mixed &quot;paella&quot; was born. This &quot;paella&quot; is sometimes called &quot;preparación barroca&quot; (baroque preparation) due to the variety of ingredients and its final presentation.

During the 20th century, paella&#x27;s popularity spread past Spain&#x27;s borders. As other cultures set out to make paella, the dish invariably acquired regional influences. Consequently, &quot;paella&quot; recipes went from being relatively simple to including a wide variety of seafood, meat, sausage (including chorizo), vegetables and many different seasonings.

Throughout non-Valencia Spain, some restaurants providing this mixed version refer to it as &quot;Paella valenciana&quot;. However, Valencians insist that only the original two Valencia recipes are authentic.

Other Valencian recipes with similar preparations are &quot;arròs a banda&quot; and &quot;arròs del senyoret&quot;.

== Basic cooking methods ==

According to tradition in Valencia, &quot;paella&quot; is cooked over an open fire, fueled by orange tree and pine branches and pine cones. This produces an aromatic smoke which infuses the &quot;paella&quot;. Also, dining guests traditionally eat directly out of the pan instead of serving in plates.

Some recipes call for &quot;paella&quot; to be covered and left to settle for five to ten minutes after cooking.

After cooking &quot;paella&quot;, a layer of scorched rice may be at the bottom of the pan, called &quot;socarrat&quot; in Valencià. The layer develops on its own if the &quot;paella&quot; is cooked over a burner or open fire. This is traditionally considered positive (as long as it is not burnt), and Valencia natives enjoy eating it.

== Variants ==
=== Philippines ===
&quot;Arroz a la valenciana&quot; (Spanish) or &quot;Arroz à valenciana&quot; (Portuguese) is considered as a part of Philippine cuisine. It is considered as the Philippine version of paella.

The Philippine version uses glutinous rice; otherwise, the ingredients are the same. In the Philippines, &quot;arroz a la valenciana&quot; refers to chicken, and &quot;longganisa&quot; (&quot;chorizo&quot;) versions.

== In popular culture ==
=== Competitions and records ===

It has become a custom at mass gatherings in the Valencia region (festivals, political campaigns, protests, etc.) to prepare enormous paellas, sometimes to win a place in the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; book. Chefs use gargantuan &quot;paelleras&quot; for these events.

Valencia restaurateur Juan Galbis claims to have made the world&#x27;s largest &quot;paella&quot; with help from a team of workers on 2 October 2001. This &quot;paella&quot; fed about 110,000 people, according to Galbis&#x27; former website. Galbis says this &quot;paella&quot; was even larger than his earlier world-record &quot;paella&quot; made on 8 March 1992, which fed about 100,000 people. Galbis&#x27; record-breaking 1992 &quot;paella&quot; is listed in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;.

=== Alternative ingredients ===
Some non-Spanish chefs include chorizo in their paellas and other ingredients, which Valencians believe do not belong in &quot;paella&quot; of any type. The alternative name proposed for these dishes, although pejorative, is (&#x27;rice with things&#x27;). Famous cases are Jamie Oliver&#x27;s &quot;paella&quot; recipe (which included chorizo) and Gordon Ramsay&#x27;s. The author Josep Pla once noted: &quot;The abuses committed in the name of Paella Valenciana are excessive – an absolute scandal.&quot;

However, in an article for &quot;El País&quot;, Spanish food writer Ana Vega &#x27;Biscayenne&#x27;, citing historical references, showed that traditional Valencian paella did indeed include chorizo, exclaiming, &quot;Ah Jamie, we&#x27;ll have to invite you to the Falles.&quot;

===Emoji===
In 2015, an emoji for &quot;paella&quot; was proposed to Unicode. The emoji was approved for Unicode 9.0 as in June 2016. Apple Inc.&#x27;s version of the emoji originally depicted Paella de marisco, but was later changed to a more traditional appearance with chicken after online controversy.

== Related dishes ==

<text>Khazaran was a city in the Khazar kingdom, located on the eastern bank of the lower Volga River. It was connected to Atil by a pontoon bridge.

Khazaran was later inhabited primarily by Muslims and featured numerous mosques, minarets, and madrasas. It was a bustling trade center easily reachable by ship from the Caspian Sea and Volga River, and many of its inhabitants were crafters, fishers, and traders. The leader of the city was a Muslim official known as the Khazz; in Arab sources the title given is sometimes vizier.

<text>The Fallas (; ) is a traditional celebration held annually in commemoration of Saint Joseph in the city of Valencia, Spain. The five main days celebrated are from 15 to 19 March, while the Mascletà, a pyrotechnic spectacle of firecracker detonation, takes place every day from 1 to 19 March. The term &quot;Fallas&quot; refers to both the celebration and the Falla monuments (&quot;Falla&quot;, singular; &quot;Fallas&quot;/, plural) burnt during the celebration. The Fallas (&quot;Falles&quot; in Valencian) festival was added to UNESCO&#x27;s intangible cultural heritage of humanity list on 30 November 2016. A number of towns in the Valencian Community have similar celebrations inspired by the original Fallas de Valencia festival. For example, the Bonfires of Saint John (&quot;Hogueras de San Juan&quot; or &quot;Fogueres de Sant Joan&quot;) in Alicante or the Fiestas de la Magdalena in Castellón de la Plana.

Each neighbourhood of the city has an organised group of people, the Commission, that meets at the &quot;Casal faller&quot;, and works all year long holding fundraising parties and dinners, usually featuring the noted dish paella, a specialty of the region. Each &quot;commission&quot; produces a construction known as &quot;falla&quot; which is burned the last day of the celebration. Currently there are approximately 400 registered commissions in Valencia.

==Etymology==
The name of the festival is the plural of the Valencian word &quot;falla&quot;. The word&#x27;s derivation is as follows:
:Latin &quot;&quot; (accusative &quot;facem&quot;), &quot;torch&quot; → Latin &quot;&quot; (diminutive; accusative &quot;faculam&quot;) → Vulgar Latin *&quot;faclam&quot; → Valencian &quot;falla&quot;.

==&quot;Falles&quot; and &quot;ninots&quot;==

Formerly, much time would be spent by the &quot;casal faller&quot; preparing the &quot;ninots&quot; (Valencian name for puppets or dolls). During the four days leading up to 19 March, each group takes its &quot;ninot&quot; out for a grand parade, and then mounts it, each on its own elaborate firecracker-filled cardboard and paper-mâché artistic monument, in a street of the given neighbourhood. This whole assembly is a &quot;falla&quot;.

The &quot;ninots&quot; and their &quot;falles&quot; are constructed according to an agreed-upon theme that has traditionally been a satirical jab at whatever draws the attention of the &quot;fallers&quot; (the registered participants of the &quot;casals&quot;). In modern times, the two-week-long festival has spawned a substantial local industry, to the point that an entire suburban area has been designated the &quot;Ciutat fallera&quot; (Falles City). Here, crews of artists and artisans, sculptors, painters, and other craftsmen, all spend months producing elaborate constructions of paper and wax, wood and polystyrene foam tableaux towering up to five stories, composed of fanciful figures, often caricatures, in provocative poses arranged in a gravity-defying manner. Each of them is produced under the direction of one of the many individual neighbourhood &quot;casals fallers&quot; who vie with each other to attract the best artists, and then to create the most outrageous allegorical monument to their target. There are about 750 of these neighbourhood associations in Valencia, with over 200,000 members, or a quarter of the city&#x27;s population.

During Fallas, many people wear their &quot;casal faller&quot; dress of regional and historical costumes from different eras of València&#x27;s history. The &quot;dolçaina&quot; (an oboe-like reed instrument) and &quot;tabalet&quot; (a kind of Valencian drum) are frequently heard, as most of the different casals fallers have their own traditional bands.

Although the &quot;Falles&quot; is a very traditional event and many participants dress in medieval clothing, the &quot;ninots&quot; for 2005 included such modern characters as Shrek and George W. Bush, and the 2012 &quot;Falles&quot; included characters like Barack Obama and Lady Gaga. A literary contest organised annually since 1903 by the Lo Rat Penat cultural association recognises the work of local poets who write satirical verses in Valencian that explain these characters. The faller verses are collected in booklets (&quot;llibrets&quot;) and distributed to participants.

==Events during &quot;Fallas&quot;==

The five days and nights of &quot;Fallas&quot; might be described as a continuous street party. There are a multitude of processions: historical, religious, and comedic. Crowds in the restaurants spill out into the streets. Explosions can be heard all day long and sporadically through the night. Everyone from small children to elderly people can be seen throwing fireworks and noisemakers in the streets, which are littered with pyrotechnical debris. The timing of the events is fixed, and they fall on the same date every year, though there has been discussion about holding some events on the weekend preceding the Fallas, to take greater advantage of the tourist potential of the festival or changing the end date in years where it is due to occur in midweek.

But outside the Fallas proper, the Fallas season within the Valencian Community begins on the final Sunday of February and lasts till 19 March, St. Joseph&#x27;s Day.

=== Opening Night (La Crida) === 
Held on the last Sunday of February, &quot;La Crida&quot; is held in the evening at the Torres de Serranos, the historical gateway to the city. Preceded by a fireworks display and a &quot;son et lumierie&quot; show, the city&#x27;s mayor presents the keys to the Fallera Major and her princess, and after their addresses formally declaring the commencement of the festivities, the Himne de l&#x27;Exposició and Marcha Real are played by the city band to mark the formal start of the festivity season.

===La Despertà===
Each day of Falles begins at 8:00 am with &quot;La Despertà&quot; (&quot;the wake-up call&quot;). Brass bands appear from the casals and begin to march down every street playing lively music. Close behind them are the &quot;fallers&quot;, throwing large firecrackers in the street as they go.

===La Mascletà===

The &quot;Mascletà&quot;, an explosive barrage of coordinated firecracker and fireworks displays, takes place at 2:00 pm from March 1 to 19 (including the festival proper); the main event is the municipal Mascletà in the &quot;Plaça de l&#x27;Ajuntament&quot; where the pyrotechnicians compete for the honour of providing the final Mascletà of the &quot;festes&quot; (on 19 March). At 2:00 pm the clock chimes and the Fallera Major, dressed in her &quot;fallera&quot; finery, will call from the balcony of City Hall, &quot;Senyor/a pirotècnic/a, pot començar la mascletà!&quot; (&quot;Mr./Ms. Pyrotechnic, the Mascletà may commence!&quot;), and the Mascletà begins.

The Mascletà is almost unique to the Valencian Community, and very popular with the Valencian people. Smaller neighbourhoods often hold their own mascletà for saints&#x27; days, weddings and other celebrations.

A nighttime variant runs in the evening hours by the same pyrotechnicans that were present in the afternoon. In some days, women pyrotechnicians are selected to compete. The event is televised regionwide.

===La Plantà===

On the day of the 15th, all of the &quot;falles infantils&quot; are to be finished being constructed, and later that night all of the &quot;falles majors&quot; (big Falles) are to be completed. If not, they face disqualification.

Once the City &quot;Falles Major&quot; is finally done a fireworks display -&quot;Amb de las Falles&quot; - is held at City Hall Square to pay tribute to everyone who made these works possible.

===L&#x27;Ofrena de flors===
In this event, the flower offering, each of the casals fallers takes an offering of flowers to the Virgin Mary, titled as &quot;Our Lady of the Forsaken&quot;, principal patroness of the city of Valencia and the wider Community. This occurs all day during 17–18 March, the first day attended by the Falleja Major and her court. A statue of the Virgin Mary and its large pedestal are then covered with all the flowers.

===Els Castells and La Nit del Foc===
On the nights of the 15, 16, 17, and 18th there are firework displays in the old riverbed in València. Each night is progressively grander and the last is called &quot;La Nit del Foc&quot; (the Night of Fire).

===Cavalcada del Foc===
On the final evening of Falles, at 7:00 pm on 19 March, a parade known in Valencian as the &quot;Cavalcada del Foc&quot; (the Fire Parade) takes place along Colón street and Porta de la Mar square. This spectacular celebration of fire, the symbol of the fiesta&#x27;s spirit, is the &quot;grand finale&quot; of Fallas and a colourful, noisy event featuring exhibitions of the varied rites and displays from around the world which use fire; it incorporates floats, giant mechanisms, people in costumes, rockets, gunpowder, street performances and music.

===La Cremà===
On the final night of Falles, around midnight on 19 March, these &quot;falles&quot; are burnt as huge bonfires. This is known as &quot;La Cremà&quot; (the Burning), the climax of the whole event, and the reason why the constructions are called &quot;falles&quot; (&quot;torches&quot;). Traditionally, the falla in the &quot;Plaça de l&#x27;Ajuntament&quot; is burned last.

All &quot;commissions&quot; have a &quot;falla infantil&quot; (children&#x27;s &quot;falles&quot;, smaller and without satirical themes), which are held a few meters away from the main one. This is burnt first, at 10:00 pm. The main neighbourhood &quot;falles&quot; are burnt closer to midnight; the burning of the &quot;falles&quot; in the city centre often starts later. For example, in 2005, the fire brigade delayed the burning of the Egyptian funeral &quot;falla&quot; in &quot;Carrer del Convent de Jerusalem&quot; until 1:30 am, when they were sure all safety concerns were addressed.

Each &quot;falla&quot; is laden with fireworks which are lit first. The construction itself is lit either after or during the explosion of these fireworks. &quot;Falles&quot; burn quite quickly, and the heat given off is felt by all around. The heat from the larger ones often drives the crowd back a couple of metres, even though they are already behind barriers that the fire brigade has set several meters from the construction. In narrower streets, the heat scorches the surrounding buildings, and the firemen douse their fronts, window blinds, street signs, etc. with water hoses to stop them catching fire or melting, from the beginning of the &quot;cremà&quot; until it cools down.

Away from the &quot;falles&quot;, people frolic in the streets, the whole city resembling an open-air dance party, except that instead of music there is the incessant (and occasionally deafening) sound of people throwing fireworks around randomly. There are many stalls selling trinkets and snacks such as the typical fried &quot;porres&quot;, &quot;churros&quot; and &quot;bunyols&quot;, as well as roasted chestnuts.

While the smaller fallas dotted around the streets are burned at approximately the same time, the last falla to be burned is the main one, which is saved until last so that everybody can watch it. This main falla is found outside the &quot;Ajuntament&quot; – the city hall building. People arrive a few hours before the scheduled burning time to get a front row view. This final falla is burned in public after the signal from the Fallera Major to officially commence.

===Traditional Dressing===
The traditional dress worn by &quot;fallers&quot; (males) has changed from black trousers and black jacket with white shirt and other motives, to colorful and a more traditional and historic custom with many decorations. These dresses can be very expensive but not as much as the dresses by the &quot;reines falleras&quot; (queens of the festival) and the Royal Court. Prices of female traditional dresses can vary from 2,000 Euros to more than 20,000 Euros. Some of them are astonishing in beauty. They are accompanied with traditional hair style and jewelry.

==History==
There are different conjectures regarding the origin of the Fallas festival. One suggests that the Fallas started in the Middle Ages, when artisans disposed of the broken artefacts and pieces of wood they saved during the winter by burning them to celebrate the spring equinox. Valencian carpenters used planks of wood called &quot;parots&quot; to hang their candles on during the winter, as these were needed to provide light to work by. With the coming of the spring, they were no longer necessary, so they were burned. Over time, and with the intervention of the Church, the date of the burning of these &quot;parots&quot; was made to coincide with the celebration of the festival of Saint Joseph, the patron saint of carpenters.

This tradition continued to evolve. The &quot;parot&quot; was dressed with clothing so that it looked like a person; features identifiable with some well-known person from the neighbourhood were often added as well. To collect these materials, children went from house to house asking for &quot;una estoreta velleta&quot; (an old rug) to add to the &quot;parot&quot;. This became a popular song that the children sang as they gathered all sorts of old flammable furniture and utensils to burn in the bonfire with the &quot;parot&quot;. These &quot;parots&quot; were the first &quot;ninots&quot;. Over the years, people of the neighbourhoods began to organise the building of the &quot;falles&quot;, and thus the typically intricate constructions, including their various figures, were born.

Until the beginning of the 20th century, the &quot;falles&quot; were tall boxes with three or four wax dolls dressed in fabric clothing. This changed when the creators began to use cardboard. The fabrication of the &quot;falles&quot; continues to evolve in modern times, when the largest displays are made of polystyrene and soft cork easily molded with hot saws. These techniques have allowed the creation of &quot;falles&quot; over 30 metres high.
The origin of the pagan festival is similar to that of the Bonfires of Saint John celebrated in the Alicante region, in the sense that both came from the Latin custom of lighting fires to welcome spring. In València, this ancient tradition led to the burning of accumulated waste, particularly wood, at the end of winter on the feast day of Saint Joseph. Given the reputed humorous character of Valencians, it was natural that the people began to burn figurines depicting persons and events of the past year. The burning symbolised liberation from living in servitude to the memory of these events or else represented humorous and often critical commentary on them. The festival thus evolved a more satirical and ironic character, and the wooden castoffs gradually came to be assembled into progressively more elaborate &#x27;monuments&#x27; that were designed and painted in advance.
In the early 20th century, and especially during the Spanish Civil War, the monuments became more anti-clerical in nature and were often highly critical of the local or national governments, which tried to ban the Falles many times, without success. Under the dictatorship of Francisco Franco the celebration lost much of its satirical nature because of government censorship, but the monuments were among the few fervent public expressions allowed then, and they could be made freely in València. During this period, many religious customs such as the offering of flowers to &quot;Mare de Déu dels Desamparats&quot; (Our Lady of the Forsaken) were taken up, which today are essential parts of the festival, even though they were unrelated to the original purpose of the celebration.

With the restoration of democracy and the end of government censorship, the critical &quot;falles&quot; reappeared, and obscene satirical ones with them. Despite thirty years of freedom of expression, the world view of the &quot;faller&quot; can still be socially conservative, is often sexist and may involve some of the amoralism of Valencian politics. This has sometimes led to criticism by certain cultural critics, environmentalists, and progressives. Yet there are celebrants of all ideologies and factions, and they have different interpretations of the spirit of the celebration. Although recent initiatives such as the pilota championships, literary competitions and other events have broadened its cultural expression, the city still embraces such ancient traditions to express its own singular identity.

=== Fallas suspensions ===
Throughout its history the Fallas have been suspended six times.

In 1886 the fallers refused to place the monuments in protest against the increase of the canon from 5 pesetas to 60 pesetas imposed in 1851 that penalized their placement on the street. The follow-up was not complete and there were two failures.

In 1896 a state of war was declared because of the Spanish American War, and the Fallas were annulled two days before its beginning.

In the years 1937, 1938 and 1939, the Fallas were suspended due to the Spanish Civil War. The suspension did not affect the Fallas of 1936 since they had already been held when the war started. The money destined for the Fallas was destined to the republican cause at the beginning of the war.

On 10 March 2020, the Valencian Generalitat, after a Ministry of Health report, decided to suspend and postpone the parties of Fallas and all the acts that comprise it as a result of the coronavirus epidemic as a preventive measure to stop the spread of the virus. The festival was cancelled in 2021 and returned in 2022.

== Secció Especial ==
The Secció Especial is a group of the largest and most prestigious &quot;falles&quot; commissions in the city of Valencia. In 2007, the group consisted of 14 commissions. This class of &quot;falles&quot; was first started in 1942 and originally included the &quot;falles&quot; of Barques, Reina-Pau and Plaça del Mercat. Currently, none of these are still in the group. The commission that has most often participated in this group as of 2015 was Na Jordana, with 62 times. The Secció Especial awards the prizes with the exception of the one awarded by the Valencia City Council; winning the first prize in the Secció Especial is the most prestigious prize any falla can win. All other &quot;falles&quot; fall into different classes (18 as of 2017) determined by the amount of money invested in each of these works.

<text>Samandar (also Semender) was a city in (and briefly capital of) Khazaria, on the western shore of the Caspian Sea, in what is now Daghestan. At some later date, it may have been moved inland to some areas near the present-day village of Shelkovskaya in the modern Chechen Republic.

==Location==
The exact location of the city is unknown. Medieval Arabic sources report simply that it was midway between Derbent and Atil, near the shore of the Caspian Sea. Modern scholars have variously identified Samandar with Kizlyar on the Terek River, or with Tarki further south on the Caspian coast. Tarki corresponds more closely to medieval sources, as the 10th-century &quot;Hudud al-&#x27;Alam&quot; reports that Samandar was on the coast, and archaeological finds from the Khazar period, including fortifications, have been found there. The city might possibly had been moved at some later date to the hill fort corresponding to the present day location of the village of Shelkovskaya on the Terek.

==History==
The Russian scholar Svetlana Pletnyova suggested that the name &quot;Samandar&quot; meant &quot;Farthest Gate&quot; in Middle Persian, and that the town was built by the Sassanid ruler Khosrow I in the 6th century. Other scholars have proposed that the name of the city may derive from the name of a Hunnish tribe &quot;Zabender&quot;. The Greek writer Theophylact Simocatta refers to a migration of Zabender from Asia to Europe in about 598; in addition, an Armenian book on geography attributed to Moses of Chorene mentions a town &quot;M-s-n-d-r&quot; in the land of Huns located to the north of Derbent.

Samandar became the second capital of the Khazar Khaganate in the 720s, after Balanjar was abandoned as a result of the Umayyad invasion. For the same reason, the capital was moved again further north to Atil, sometime between 730 and 750.

According to the 10th-century geographers al-Istakhri and Ibn Hawqal, Samandar was inhabited by Jews, Christians, Muslims, and members of other religious faiths, each of which had its houses of worship. According to al-Istakhri, Samandar was famous for its fertile gardens and vineyards, and a lively centre of commerce with several markets; the city was mostly built of wood. Samandar, like Atil, was destroyed by Kievan Rus&#x27; prince Sviatoslav in the 960s, leading to a decline and disappearance of Khazaria.

<text>Murphy&#x27;s law is an adage or epigram that is typically stated as: &quot;Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.&quot;.

Though similar statements and concepts have been made over the course of history, the law itself was coined by, and named after, American aerospace engineer Edward A. Murphy Jr.; its exact origins are debated, but it is generally agreed it originated from Murphy and his team following a mishap during rocket sled tests some time between 1948 and 1949, and was finalized and first popularized by testing project head John Stapp during a later press conference. Murphy&#x27;s original quote was the precautionary design advice that &quot;If there are two or more ways to do something and one of those results in a catastrophe, then someone will do it that way.&quot;

The law entered wider public knowledge in the late 1970s with the publication of Arthur Bloch&#x27;s 1977 book &quot;Murphy&#x27;s Law, and Other Reasons Why Things Go WRONG&quot;, which included other variations and corollaries of the law. Since then, Murphy&#x27;s law has remained a popular (and occasionally misused) adage, though its accuracy has been disputed by academics. 

Similar &quot;laws&quot; include Sod&#x27;s law, Finagle&#x27;s law, and Yhprum&#x27;s law, among others.

== History ==
The perceived perversity of the universe has long been a subject of comment, and precursors to the modern version of Murphy&#x27;s law are abundant. According to Robert A. J. Matthews in a 1997 article in &quot;Scientific American&quot;, the &quot;name&quot; &quot;Murphy&#x27;s law&quot; originated in 1949, but the &quot;concept&quot; itself had already long since been known. As quoted by Richard Rhodes, Matthews said, &quot;The familiar version of Murphy&#x27;s law is not quite 50 years old, but the essential idea behind it has been around for centuries. […] The modern version of Murphy&#x27;s Law has its roots in U.S. Air Force studies performed in 1949 on the effects of rapid deceleration on pilots.&quot; Matthews goes on to explain how Edward A. Murphy Jr. was the eponym, but only because his original thought was modified subsequently into the now established form that is not exactly what he himself had said. Research into the origin of Murphy&#x27;s law has been conducted by members of the American Dialect Society (ADS). 

Mathematician Augustus De Morgan wrote on June 23, 1866: &quot;The first experiment already illustrates a truth of the theory, well confirmed by practice, what-ever can happen will happen if we make trials enough.&quot; In later publications &quot;whatever can happen will happen&quot; occasionally is termed &quot;Murphy&#x27;s law&quot;, which raises the possibility that &quot;Murphy&quot; is simply &quot;De Morgan&quot; misremembered.

ADS member Stephen Goranson found a version of the law, not yet generalized or bearing that name, in a report by Alfred Holt at an 1877 meeting of an engineering society.
It is found that anything that can go wrong at sea generally does go wrong sooner or later, so it is not to be wondered that owners prefer the safe to the scientific … Sufficient stress can hardly be laid on the advantages of simplicity. The human factor cannot be safely neglected in planning machinery. If attention is to be obtained, the engine must be such that the engineer will be disposed to attend to it.
ADS member Bill Mullins found a slightly broader version of the aphorism in reference to stage magic. The British stage magician Nevil Maskelyne wrote in 1908:
It is an experience common to all men to find that, on any special occasion, such as the production of a magical effect for the first time in public, everything that &quot;can&quot; go wrong &quot;will&quot; go wrong. Whether we must attribute this to the malignity of matter or to the total depravity of inanimate things, whether the exciting cause is hurry, worry, or what not, the fact remains.
In astronomy, &quot;Spode&#x27;s Law&quot; refers to the phenomenon that the skies are always cloudy at the wrong moment; the law was popularized by amateur astronomer Patrick Moore but dates from the 1930s.

In 1948, humorist Paul Jennings coined the term &quot;resistentialism&quot;, a jocular play on &quot;resistance&quot; and &quot;existentialism&quot;, to describe &quot;seemingly spiteful behavior manifested by inanimate objects&quot;, where objects that cause problems (like lost keys or a runaway bouncy ball) are said to exhibit a high degree of malice toward humans.

In 1952, as an epigraph to the mountaineering book &quot;The Butcher: The Ascent of Yerupaja&quot;, John Sack described the same principle, &quot;Anything that can possibly go wrong, does&quot;, as an &quot;ancient mountaineering adage&quot;.

=== Association with Murphy===

Differing recollections years later by various participants make it impossible to pinpoint who first coined the saying &quot;Murphy&#x27;s law&quot;. The law&#x27;s name supposedly stems from an attempt to use new measurement devices developed by Edward A. Murphy, a United States Air Force (USAF) captain and aeronautical engineer. The phrase was coined in an adverse reaction to something Murphy said when his devices failed to perform and was eventually cast into its present form prior to a press conference some months later – the first ever (of many) given by John Stapp, a USAF colonel and flight surgeon in the 1950s.

From 1948 to 1949, Stapp headed research project MX981 at Muroc Army Air Field (later renamed Edwards Air Force Base) for the purpose of testing the human tolerance for g-forces during rapid deceleration. The tests used a rocket sled mounted on a railroad track with a series of hydraulic brakes at the end. Initial tests used a humanoid crash test dummy strapped to a seat on the sled, but subsequent tests were performed by Stapp, at that time a USAF captain. During the tests, questions were raised about the accuracy of the instrumentation used to measure the g-forces Captain Stapp was experiencing. Edward Murphy proposed using electronic strain gauges attached to the restraining clamps of Stapp&#x27;s harness to measure the force exerted on them by his rapid deceleration. Murphy was engaged in supporting similar research using high speed centrifuges to generate g-forces.

During a trial run of this method using a chimpanzee, supposedly around June 1949, Murphy&#x27;s assistant wired the harness and the rocket sled was launched. The sensors provided a zero reading; however, it became apparent that they had been installed incorrectly, with some sensors wired backwards. It was at this point a frustrated Murphy made his pronouncement, despite being offered the time and chance to calibrate and test the sensor installation prior to the test proper, which he declined somewhat irritably, getting off on the wrong foot with the MX981 team. George E. Nichols, an engineer and quality assurance manager with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory who was present at the time, recalled in an interview that Murphy blamed the failure on his assistant after the failed test, saying, &quot;If that guy has any way of making a mistake, he will.&quot; Nichols&#x27; account is that &quot;Murphy&#x27;s law&quot; came about through conversation among the other members of the team; it was condensed to &quot;If it can happen, it will happen&quot;, and named for Murphy in mockery of what Nichols perceived as arrogance on Murphy&#x27;s part. Others, including Edward Murphy&#x27;s surviving son Robert Murphy, deny Nichols&#x27; account, and claim that the phrase did originate with Edward Murphy. According to Robert Murphy&#x27;s account, his father&#x27;s statement was along the lines of &quot;If there&#x27;s more than one way to do a job, and one of those ways will result in disaster, then he will do it that way.&quot;

The phrase first received public attention during a press conference in which Stapp was asked how it was that nobody had been severely injured during the rocket sled tests. Stapp replied that it was because they always took &quot;Murphy&#x27;s law&quot; under consideration; he then summarized the law and said that in general, it meant that it was important to consider all the possibilities (possible things that could go wrong) before doing a test and act to counter them. Thus Stapp&#x27;s usage and Murphy&#x27;s alleged usage are very different in outlook and attitude. One is sour, the other an affirmation of the predictable being surmountable, usually by sufficient planning and redundancy. Nichols believes Murphy was unwilling to take the responsibility for the device&#x27;s initial failure (by itself a blip of no large significance) and is to be doubly damned for not allowing the MX981 team time to validate the sensor&#x27;s operability and for trying to blame an underling in the embarrassing aftermath.

The name &quot;Murphy&#x27;s law&quot; was not immediately secure. A story by Lee Correy in the February 1955 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; referred to &quot;Reilly&#x27;s law&quot;, which states that &quot;in any scientific or engineering endeavor, anything that can go wrong &quot;will&quot; go wrong&quot;. Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Lewis Strauss was quoted in the &quot;Chicago Daily Tribune&quot; on February 12, 1955, saying &quot;I hope it will be known as Strauss&#x27; law. It could be stated about like this: If anything bad can happen, it probably will.&quot;

Arthur Bloch, in the first volume (1977) of his &quot;Murphy&#x27;s Law, and Other Reasons Why Things Go WRONG&quot; series, prints a letter that he received from Nichols, who recalled an event that occurred in 1949 at Edwards Air Force Base that, according to him, is the origination of Murphy&#x27;s law, and first publicly recounted by Stapp. An excerpt from the letter reads:

The law&#x27;s namesake was Capt. Ed Murphy, a development engineer from Wright Field Aircraft Lab. Frustration with a strap transducer which was malfunctioning due to an error in wiring the strain gage bridges caused him to remark – &quot;If there is any way to do it wrong, he will&quot; – referring to the technician who had wired the bridges at the Lab. I assigned Murphy&#x27;s law to the statement and the associated variations.

==== Disputed origins ====
The association with the Muroc incident is by no means secure. Despite extensive research, no trace of documentation of the saying as &quot;Murphy&#x27;s law&quot; has been found before 1951. The next citations are not found until 1955, when the May–June issue of &quot;Aviation Mechanics Bulletin&quot; included the line &quot;Murphy&#x27;s law: If an aircraft part can be installed incorrectly, someone will install it that way&quot;, and Lloyd Mallan&#x27;s book &quot;Men, Rockets and Space Rats&quot;, referred to: &quot;Colonel Stapp&#x27;s favorite takeoff on sober scientific laws—Murphy&#x27;s law, Stapp calls it—&#x27;Everything that can possibly go wrong will go wrong&#x27;.&quot; In 1962, the Mercury Seven attributed Murphy&#x27;s law to United States Navy training films.

Fred R. Shapiro, the editor of the &quot;Yale Book of Quotations&quot;, has shown that in 1952 the adage was called &quot;Murphy&#x27;s law&quot; in a book by Anne Roe, quoting an unnamed physicist:

he described [it] as &quot;Murphy&#x27;s law or the fourth law of thermodynamics&quot; (actually there were only three last I heard) which states: &quot;If anything can go wrong, it will.&quot;
In May 1951, Anne Roe gave a transcript of an interview (part of a thematic apperception test, asking impressions on a drawing) with said physicist: &quot;As for himself he realized that this was the inexorable working of the second law of the thermodynamics which stated Murphy&#x27;s law &#x27;If anything can go wrong it will&#x27;. I always liked &#x27;Murphy&#x27;s law&#x27;. I was told that by an architect.&quot; ADS member Stephen Goranson, investigating this in 2008 and 2009, found that Anne Roe&#x27;s papers, held in the American Philosophical Society&#x27;s archives in Philadelphia, identified the interviewed physicist as Howard Percy &quot;Bob&quot; Robertson (1903–1961). Robertson&#x27;s papers at the Caltech archives include a letter in which Robertson offers Roe an interview within the first three months of 1949, making this apparently predate the Muroc incident said to have occurred in or after June 1949.

John Paul Stapp, Edward A. Murphy, Jr., and George Nichols were jointly awarded an Ig Nobel Prize in 2003 in engineering &quot; for (probably) giving birth to the name&quot;. Murphy&#x27;s Law was also the theme of 2024 Ig Nobel Prize ceremony.

== Academic and scientific views ==
According to Richard Dawkins, so-called laws like Murphy&#x27;s law and Sod&#x27;s law are nonsense because they require inanimate objects to have desires of their own, or else to react according to one&#x27;s own desires. Dawkins points out that a certain class of events may occur all the time, but are only noticed when they become a nuisance. He gives an example of aircraft noise pollution interfering with filming: there are always aircraft in the sky at any given time, but they are only taken note of when they cause a problem. This is a form of confirmation bias, whereby the investigator seeks out evidence to confirm their already-formed ideas, but does not look for evidence that contradicts them.

Similarly, David Hand, emeritus professor of mathematics and senior research investigator at Imperial College London, points out that the law of truly large numbers should lead one to expect the kind of events predicted by Murphy&#x27;s law to occur occasionally. Selection bias will ensure that those ones are remembered and the many times Murphy&#x27;s law was not true are forgotten.

There have been persistent references to Murphy&#x27;s law associating it with the laws of thermodynamics from early on (see the quotation from Anne Roe&#x27;s book above). In particular, Murphy&#x27;s law is often cited as a form of the second law of thermodynamics (the law of entropy) because both are predicting a tendency to a more disorganized state. Atanu Chatterjee investigated this idea by formally stating Murphy&#x27;s law in mathematical terms and found that Murphy&#x27;s law so stated could be disproved using the principle of least action.

== Variations (corollaries) of the law ==
From its initial public announcement, Murphy&#x27;s law quickly spread to various technical cultures connected to aerospace engineering. Before long, variations of the law applied to different topics and subjects had passed into the public imagination, changing over time. Arthur Bloch compiled a number of books of corollaries to Murphy&#x27;s law and variations thereof, the first being &quot;Murphy&#x27;s Law, and Other Reasons Why Things Go WRONG&quot;, which received several follow-ups and reprints.

Yhprum&#x27;s law is an optimistic reversal of Murphy&#x27;s law, stating that &quot;anything that can go right will go right&quot;. Its name directly references this, being &quot;Murphy&quot; in reverse.

Management consultant Peter Drucker formulated &quot;Drucker&#x27;s law&quot; in dealing with complexity of management: &quot;If one thing goes wrong, everything else will, and at the same time.&quot;

&quot;Mrs. Murphy&#x27;s law&quot; is a corollary of Murphy&#x27;s law, which states that &quot;Anything that can go wrong will go wrong while Mr. Murphy is out of town.&quot;

The term is sometimes used to describe concise, ironic, humorous rules of thumb that often do not share a relation to the original law or Edward Murphy himself, but still posit him as a relevant expert in the law&#x27;s subject. Examples of these &quot;Murphy&#x27;s laws&quot; include those for military tactics, technology, romance, social relations, research, and business.

<doc id="47636" wikidata="Q35754" url="?curid=47636" title="International Sign">
<text>International Sign (IS) is a pidgin sign language which is used in a variety of different contexts, particularly as an international auxiliary language at meetings such as the World Federation of the Deaf (WFD) congress, in some European Union settings, and at some UN conferences, at events such as the Deaflympics, the Miss &amp; Mister Deaf World, and Eurovision, and informally when travelling and socialising.

Linguists do not agree on what the term &quot;International Sign&quot; means precisely, and empirically derived dictionaries are lacking.

== Naming ==
While the more commonly used term is International Sign, it is sometimes referred to as Gestuno, or International Sign Pidgin and International Gesture (IG). International Sign (IS) is a term used by the World Federation of the Deaf (WFD) and other international organisations.

==History==
Deaf people in the Western and Middle Eastern world have gathered together using sign language for 2,000 years. When Deaf people from different sign language backgrounds get together, a variety of sign language arises from this contact, whether it is in an informal personal context or in a formal international context. Deaf people have therefore used a kind of auxiliary gestural system for international communication at sporting or cultural events since the early 19th century. The need to standardise an international sign system was discussed at the first World Deaf Congress in 1951, when the WFD was formed. In the following years, a pidgin developed as the delegates from different language backgrounds communicated with each other, and in 1973, a WFD committee (&quot;the Commission of Unification of Signs&quot;) published a standardized vocabulary. They selected &quot;naturally spontaneous and easy signs in common use by deaf people of different countries&quot; to make the language easy to learn. A book published by the commission in 1975, &quot;Gestuno: International Sign Language of the Deaf&quot;, contains a vocabulary list of 1,470 signs. The name &quot;Gestuno&quot; was chosen, referencing &quot;gesture&quot; and &quot;oneness&quot;.

However, when Gestuno was first used at the WFD congress in Bulgaria in 1976, it was incomprehensible to deaf participants. Subsequently, it was developed informally by deaf and hearing interpreters, and came to include more grammar, especially linguistic features that are thought to be universal among sign languages, such as role shifting, movement repetitions, the use of signing space, and classifiers. Additionally, the vocabulary was gradually replaced by more iconic signs and loan signs from various sign languages.

The first training course in Gestuno was conducted in Copenhagen in 1977 to prepare interpreters for the 5th World Conference on Deafness. Sponsored by the Danish Association of the Deaf and the University of Copenhagen, the course was designed by Robert M. Ingram and taught by Betty L. Ingram, two American interpreters of deaf parents.

The name &quot;Gestuno&quot; has fallen out of use, and the phrase &quot;International Sign&quot; is now more commonly used in English to identify this variety of sign. This may be because current IS has little in common with the signs published under the name &quot;Gestuno&quot;.

== Description ==
International Sign has been described as a highly variable type of signed communication used between two signers who lack a common sign language. Most experts do not technically consider IS to be a full language, but rather a form of communication that arises on the spot. It is characterized by a focus on iconic or pantomimic structures; IS signers may also point to nearby objects. While some degree of standardization takes place at events such WFD and the European Union of the Deaf, it is limited to vocabulary, not grammar.

There is no consensus on what International Sign is exactly. It may either refer to the way strangers sign with each other when they lack a common sign language, or it can refer to a conventionalized form used by a group of people with regular contact. The use of the term &quot;International Sign&quot; might also lead to the misconception that it is a standardized form of communication.

Deaf people typically know only one sign language. Signers from differing countries may use IS spontaneously with each other, with relative success. This communicative success is linked to various factors. First, people who sign in IS have a certain amount of shared contextual knowledge. Secondly, signers may take advantage of shared knowledge of a spoken language, such as English. Thirdly, communication is made easier by the use of iconic signs and pantomime.

==Vocabulary==
The lexicon of International Sign is made by negotiation between signers. IS signers reportedly use a set of signs from their own national sign language mixed with highly iconic signs that can be understood by a large audience. Many, not to say most, signs are taken from American Sign Language during the past 30 years. In 1973, a committee created and standardized a system of international signs. They tried to choose the most understandable signs from diverse sign languages to make the language easy to learn for not only the Deaf but for both interim management and an everyday observer. IS interpreter Bill Moody noted in a 1994 paper that the vocabulary used in conference settings is largely derived from the sign languages of the Western world and is less comprehensible to those from African or Asian sign language backgrounds. A 1999 study by Bencie Woll suggested that IS signers often use a large amount of vocabulary from their native language, choosing sign variants that would be more easily understood by a foreigner. In contrast, Rachel Rosenstock notes that the vocabulary exhibited in her study of International Sign was largely made up of highly iconic signs common to many sign languages:Over 60% of the signs occurred in the same form in more than eight SLs as well as in IS. This suggests that the majority of IS signs are not signs borrowed from a specific SL, as other studies found, but rather are common to many natural SLs. Only 2% of IS signs were found to be unique to IS. The remaining 38% were borrowed (or &quot;loan&quot;) signs that could be traced back to one SL or a group of related SLs. International Sign has a simplified lexicon. In IS for example, the English &quot;who&quot;, &quot;what&quot;, and &quot;how&quot; are all translated simply to &quot;what&quot;. Another example of this simplified lexicon is the location of the sign itself. IS will use movements on the chest to indicate feeling signs, and signs near the head will indicate cognitive activity. There have been several attempts at making dictionaries for IS. However, these lack detailed information on data collection, nor do they describe the exact meaning or how the signs should be used. This causes difficulty for training and teaching people in IS, as there is no empirical evidence.

=== Manual alphabet ===
The manual alphabet of IS belongs to the French family of manual alphabets, specifically in a subgroup around to the modern American manual alphabet. However, some letters differ in a few finger positions to the American alphabet.

IS numbers larger than five are, unlike in ASL, performed by two hands.

==Grammar==
Very little is known about the grammar of IS. It tends to use fewer mouthings and often has a larger signing space. The use of mouth gestures for adverbials is emphasized.

People communicating in IS tend to make heavy use of:
# role play,
# index and reference locations in the signing space in front of the signer, on the head and trunk, and on the non-dominant hand,
# different movement repetitions, 
# size and shape delineation techniques using handshapes and extensions of movements of the hands (&quot;size and size specifiers&quot;, or &quot;SASS&quot;), and 
# a feature common to most sign languages: an extensive formal system of classifiers used in verbs/predicates (classifiers are handshapes used to describe things, handle objects, and represent a few semantic classes that are regarded by IS signers to be widespread in sign languages, helping them to overcome linguistic barriers).
It has been noted that signers are generally better at interlingual communication than non-signers, even using a spoken lingua franca.

A paper presented in 1994 suggested that IS signers &quot;combine a relatively rich and structured grammar with a severely impoverished lexicon&quot;. Supalla and Webb (1995) describe IS as a kind of a pidgin, but conclude that it is &quot;more complex than a typical pidgin and indeed is more like that of a full sign language&quot;.

==Recent studies of International Sign==
Simplification of signs in IS can vary between interpreters (one can choose a simplification over a much longer explanation), and because of this, certain information can be lost in translation. Because sign language relies heavily on local influences, many Deaf people do not understand each other&#x27;s signs. Furthermore, cultural differences in signs can vary even within borders. In these cases, many Deaf people revert to fingerspelling and gestures or mime, which has its own variations based on similar sign language properties.

The World Federation of the Deaf (WFD) has raised concern about the issues with simplification and standardization, and that it limits a sign to a single meaning or word, thus losing all natural forms of the initial meaning.

An ethnographic study notes that there is some controversy among deaf people about how accessible IS is to deaf people from different places; it also observes that many deaf people are nevertheless highly motivated to do the work of communicating across linguistic and other differences.

<text>Kerch, also known as Keriç or Kerich (), is a city of regional significance on the Kerch Peninsula in the east of Crimea. It has a population of 

Founded 2,600 years ago as the ancient Greek colony Pantikapaion, Kerch is one of the most ancient cities in Crimea. The city experienced rapid growth starting in the 1920s and was the site of a major battle during World War II.

Today, it is one of the largest cities in Crimea and is among the area&#x27;s most important industrial, transport and tourist centres. As with the rest of Crimea, it has been occupied by Russian forces since the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014.

==History==

===Ancient times===
Archeological digs at Mayak village near the city ascertained that the area had already been inhabited in the 17th–15th centuries BC. While many finds from Kerch can be found in the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg and the local museum, a large number of antique sculptures, reliefs, bronze and glassware, ceramics and jewellery were excavated in 1855–1856 during the Crimean War by Duncan MacPherson, a surgeon from the British Army, and later donated to the British Museum in London.

Kerch as a city starts its history in the 7th century BC, when Greek colonists from Miletus founded a city-state named Panticapaeum on Mount Mithridat near the mouth of the Melek-Chesme river. Panticapaeum subdued nearby cities and by 480 BC became the capital of the Kingdom of Bosporus. Later, during the rule of Mithradates VI Eupator, Panticapaeum for a short period of time became the capital of the much more powerful and extensive Kingdom of Pontus.
The city was located at the intersection of trade routes between the steppe and Europe. This caused it to grow rapidly. The city&#x27;s main exports were grain and salted fish; wine-making was also common. Panticapaeum minted its own coins. According to extant documents the Melek-Chesme river (small and shallow nowadays) was navigable in Bosporan times, and sea galleys were able to enter the river. A large portion of the city&#x27;s population was ethnically Scythian, later Sarmatian, as the large royal barrow (Kurgan) at Kul-Oba testifies.

In the 1st century AD Panticapaeum and the Kingdom of Bosporus suffered from Ostrogoth raids; then the city was devastated by the Huns in AD 375.

Myrmekion was founded in the eastern part of the Kerch, 4 km NE of ancient Panticapaeum. The settlement was founded by Ionians in the first half of the 6th c. BC.

=== Middle Ages ===
From the 6th century the city was under the control of the Byzantine Empire. By order of Emperor Justinian I, a citadel named Bospor was built there. Bospor was the centre of a bishopric, the diocese of Bosporus and developed under the influence of Greek Christianity. In 576, it withstood a siege by the Göktürks under Bokhan, aided by Anagai, the last khan (ruler) of the Uturgurs (tribe of Huns).
In the 7th century, the Turkic Khazars took control of Bospor, and the city was named Karcha from Turkic &quot;karşı&quot; meaning &#x27;opposite, facing.&#x27; The main local government official during Khazar times was the tudun. 
During Khazar rule, Kerch was used as a major port for the Khazar slave trade, through which slaves were exported to the Black Sea slave trade.

Christianity was a major religion in Kerch during the period of Khazar rule. Kerch&#x27;s Church of St. John the Baptist was founded in 717; thus, it is the oldest church in Ukraine. The Church of the Apostles existed during the late 8th and early 9th centuries, according to the &quot;Life of the Apostle Andrew&quot; by Epiphanius of Salamis. 

Following the fall of Khazaria to Kievan Rus&#x27; in the late 10th century, Kerch became the centre of a Khazar successor-state. Its ruler, Georgius Tzul, was deposed by a Byzantine-Rus expedition in 1016.

From the 10th century, the city was a Slavic settlement named Korchev, which belonged to the Tmutarakan principality. Kerch was a center of trade between Russia&#x27;, Crimea, Caucasus and the Orient. 

In the 13th century, Crimea including Korchev was invaded by Mongols. After the Mongols, the city became the Genoese colony of Cerco (Cherkio) in 1318 and served as a sea harbour, where townspeople worked at salt works and fishery.

In 1475, the city was passed to the Ottoman Empire. During the Turkish rule Kerch fell into decay and served as a slave-market. It repeatedly suffered from raids of Zaporizhian Cossacks.

===18th–20th centuries===
In response to the strengthening of Russian military forces in Azov area, the Turks built a fortress, named Yenikale, near Kerch on the shore of Kerch Strait. The fortress was completed by 1706. In 1771 the Imperial Russian Army invaded Crimea and approached Yenikale. The Turks decided to abandon the fortress, though reinforcements from the Ottoman Empire had arrived a few days earlier. By the Peace Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji in 1774, Kerch and Yenikale were ceded to Russia. As a result, the Turkish heritage has been almost completely wiped out.

In 1790 Russian naval forces under the command of admiral Fyodor Ushakov defeated the Turkish fleet at the Battle of Kerch Strait.

Because of its location, from 1821 Kerch developed into an important trade and fishing port. The state museum of ancient times and a number of educational institutions were opened in the city. The ironwork factory was built in 1846 based on a huge iron ore deposit found on Kerch Peninsula.

During the Crimean War the city was devastated by British forces in 1855.

In the late 19th century, mechanical and cement factories were built, and tinned food and tobacco factories were established. By 1900, Kerch was connected to a railroad system, and the fairway of Kerch Strait was deepened and widened. At this time, the population had reached 33,000.

After suffering a decline during the First World War and the Russian Civil War, the city resumed its growth in the late 1920s, with the expansion of various industries, iron ore, and metallurgy in particular, and by 1939 its population had reached 104,500.

===Kerch in World War II===
On the Eastern Front of World War II from 1941 to 1945, Kerch was the site of heavy fighting between Red Army and Axis forces. After fierce fighting, the city was taken by the Germans in November 1941. On 31 December 1941, the 302nd Mountain Rifle Division recaptured the city following a naval landing operation at Kamysh Burun, to the south of the city, five days earlier. In 1942 the Germans occupied the city again. The Red Army lost over 160,000 men, either killed or taken POW at the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula. On 31 October 1943 another Soviet naval landing operation was launched. Kerch returned to Soviet control on 11 April 1944.

The German invaders killed about 15,000 citizens and deported another 14,000 during their occupation. Evidence of German atrocities in Kerch was presented in the Nuremberg trials. After the war, the city was awarded the title Hero City.

The Adzhimushkay catacombs in the city&#x27;s suburbs were the site of guerrilla warfare against the occupation. Thousands of soldiers and refugees found shelter inside and were involved in counterattacks. Many of them died underground, including those who died of numerous alleged poison gas attacks. Later, a memorial was established on the site.

<text>Liane Gabora is a professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia - Okanagan. She is known for her theory of the &quot;Origin of the modern mind through conceptual closure,&quot; which built on her earlier work on &quot;Autocatalytic closure in a cognitive system: A tentative scenario for the origin of culture.&quot;

==Career==

Gabora has contributed to the study of cultural evolution and evolution of societies, focusing on the role of personal creativity, as opposed to memetic imitation or instruction, in differentiating modern human from prior hominid or modern ape culture. In particular, she seems to follow feminist economists and green economists in making a distinction between creative &quot;enterprise&quot;, invention, art or &quot;individual capital&quot; and imitative &quot;meme&quot;, rule, social category or &quot;instructional capital&quot;.

Gabora&#x27;s views contrasts with that of memetics and of the strongest social capital theorists (e.g. Karl Marx or Paul Adler) in that she seems to see social signals or labels as markers of trust invested in individual and instructional complexes, rather than as first class actors in themselves.

Some of her more recent work is controversial in the philosophy of science and goes against the particle physics foundation ontology.

&quot;Honing Theory: A Complex Systems Framework for Creativity&quot; is her publication, which suggests that culture evolves through social interaction and exchange between minds that self-organise and modify based on their environment. Creativity arises due to the possibility of uncertainty and disorder, resulting in arousal and a process of novelty and originality until the arousal dissipates. This in turn feeds the cultural norm which in turn feeds further creativity resulting in part the evolution of culture.

<text>British Sign Language (BSL) is a sign language used in the United Kingdom and is the first or preferred language among the deaf community in the UK. While private correspondence from William Stokoe hinted at a formal name for the language in 1960, the first usage of the term &quot;British Sign Language&quot; in an academic publication was likely by Aaron Cicourel. Based on the percentage of people who reported &#x27;using British Sign Language at home&#x27; on the 2011 Scottish Census, the British Deaf Association estimates there are 151,000 BSL users in the UK, of whom 87,000 are Deaf. By contrast, in the 2011 England and Wales Census 15,000 people living in England and Wales reported themselves using BSL as their main language. People who are not deaf may also use BSL, as hearing relatives of deaf people, sign language interpreters or as a result of other contact with the British Deaf community. The language makes use of space and involves movement of the hands, body, face and head.

==History==
===Origin===
BSL is a creation of the British Deaf community. Unlike home sign, which does not pass between generations, sign languages are shared by a large community of signers.

Records show the existence of a sign language within deaf communities in England as far back as the 15th century. The &quot;History of the Syon Monastery at Lisbon and Brentford&quot;, published in 1450, contains descriptions of signs—some of which are still in use. The earliest known document describing the use of signing in a legal context mentions John de Orleton, a deaf man assigning his property to a family member in 1324. Another commonly cited event is the marriage ceremony between Thomas Tilsye and Ursula Russel in 1576.

Richard Carew&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Cornwall&quot; (1602) includes a vivid description of Edward Bone, a deaf servant, meeting his deaf friend Kempe. Bone had some knowledge of Cornish and was able to lipread, but appeared to prefer signing. Carew described the situation thus:Somewhat neerre the place of his [Bone&#x27;s] birth, there dwelt another, so affected, or rather defected, whose name was Kempe: which two, when they chaunced to meete, would use such kinde embracements, such stranfe, often, and earnest tokenings, and such heartie laughtes, and other passionate gestures, that their want of a tongue, seemed rather a hindrance to other conceiving [understanding] them, then to their conceiving one another.John Bulwer, who had an adopted deaf daughter Chirothea Johnson, authored four late-Renaissance texts related to deafness, sign language and the human body: &quot;Chirologia&quot; (1644), &quot;Philocopus&quot; (1648), &quot;Pathomyotamia&quot; (1649) and &quot;Anthropometamorphosis&quot; (1650). In particular, &quot;Chirologia&quot; focuses on the meanings of gestures, expressions and body language, and describes signs and gestures in use at the time, some of which resemble signs still in use, while &quot;Philocopus&quot; explores the use of lipreading by deaf people and the possibility of deaf education, and is dedicated to Bulwer&#x27;s two deaf brothers.

Another writer of the same time, George Dalgarno, recognised that sign language was unrelated to English. In 1661 he wrote that &quot;The deaf man has no teacher at all and through necessity may put him upon... using signs, yet those have no affinity to the language by which they that are about him do converse among themselves.&quot;

Finally, the diarist Samuel Pepys described a conversation between George Downing and a deaf boy in November 1666:But, above all, there comes in the dumb boy that I knew in Oliver&#x27;s time, who is mightily acquainted here, and with Downing; and he made strange signs of the fire, and how the King was abroad, and many things they understood, but I could not...British Sign Language has evolved, as all languages do, from these origins by modification, invention and importation.

===Early deaf education===
==== The Braidwood schools ====
Thomas Braidwood, a teacher from Edinburgh, founded &#x27;Braidwood&#x27;s Academy for the Deaf and Dumb&#x27; in 1760, which is believed to be the first school for deaf children in Britain. The school primarily taught oral communication methods, as described by Francis Green—whose son attended the Braidwood school—in the anonymous treatise &quot;Vox oculis subjecta.&quot; In this account, Green describes how his son Charles would surely develop &quot;a perfect acquaintance with language both oral and written&quot;, and how deaf pupils were given &quot;a tolerable general understanding of their own language [English] so as to read, write, and speak it, with ease&quot;. Green also describes Braidwood&#x27;s views of spoken language:Mr Braidwood hath frequently intimated to me, as an opinion founded upon his experience in this art, that articulate or spoken language hath so great and essential a tendency to confirm and enlarge ideas, above the power of written language, that it is almost impossible for deaf persons, without the use of speech, to be perfect in their ideas.Joseph Watson was trained as a teacher of the deaf under Thomas Braidwood. He eventually left in 1792 to become the headmaster of the Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb in Bermondsey. He described his teaching methods in detail in his book, &quot;On the Education of the Deaf and Dumb&quot; (1809), where he opposed the use of signed versions of spoken language such as the Signed French used in the Paris school. The book contains lists of vocabulary and plates designed to encourage a child to acquire an understanding of written and spoken language.

==== International links ====
Although the Braidwood school focused on speech, it also used an early form of sign language, &quot;the combined system&quot;, which was the first codification of British Sign Language. The Braidwood school later moved to London and was visited by Abbé Sicard and Laurent Clerc in 1815, at the same time that an American Protestant minister, Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, travelled to Europe to research teaching of deaf people.

André-Daniel Laffon de Ladebat, one of the French visitors to the Braidwood school, provided a vivid description of Laurent Clerc&#x27;s meeting with the deaf children in the bilingual English/French book, &quot;A collection of the Most Remarkable Definitions and Answers of Massieu and Clerc, Deaf and Dumb.&quot; Laurent Clerc, who was deaf, was overjoyed to find fellow sign language users:As soon as Clerc beheld this sight [of the children at dinner] his face became animated; he was as agitated as a traveller of sensibility would be on meeting all of a sudden in distant regions, a colony of his own countrymen... Clerc approached them. He made signs and they answered him by signs. The unexpected communication cause a most delicious sensation in them and for us was a scene of expression and sensibility that gave us the most heart-felt satisfaction.The Braidwood schools refused to teach Gallaudet their methods. Gallaudet then travelled to Paris and learned the educational methods of the French Royal Institution for the Deaf, a combination of Old French Sign Language and the signs developed by Abbé de l&#x27;Épée. As a consequence American Sign Language (ASL) today has a 60% similarity to modern French Sign Language and is almost unintelligible to users of British Sign Language. Gallaudet went on to establish the American School for the Deaf in 1817, which focused on manual communication and ASL, in contrast to the oral methods used in the UK.

=== Late 19th – 21st century ===
Until the 1940s, sign language skills were passed between deaf people without a unified sign language system; many deaf people lived in residential institutions. Signing was actively discouraged in schools by punishment, and deaf education emphasised teaching deaf children to learn to lip read and finger spell, due to the prevailing belief across Europe established in the 1950s that signing was bad. From the 1970s there has been an increasing tolerance and instruction in BSL in schools. The language continues to evolve as older signs such as &quot;alms&quot; and &quot;pawnbroker&quot; have fallen out of use and new signs such as &quot;internet&quot; and &quot;laser&quot; have been coined. The evolution of the language and its changing level of acceptance meant that older users tend to use more finger spelling while younger ones make use of a wider range of signs.

Paddy Ladd initiated deaf programming on British television in the 1980s and is credited with getting sign language on television and enabling deaf children to be educated in sign.

BSL users campaigned to have BSL recognised on an official level. Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 mandates the provision of interpreters. On 18 March 2003 the UK government formally recognised that BSL is a language in its own right. In 2021, Rosie Cooper introduced the British Sign Language Bill to recognise BSL as an official language, which was backed by the government. After being dormant from June 2021, the bill began moving through Parliament on 28 January 2022, but during a meeting with stakeholders on 7 February, the language of the bill was revealed to have been pared down substantially, disappointing said stakeholders. The British Deaf Association stated that it was &#x27;unhappy&#x27; with this removal of language from the bill.

== Linguistics ==
Linguistics is the study of language, including those like BSL that are not carried by sound. In all sign languages the great majority of &#x27;words&#x27; (hand gestures) cannot be understood in other sign languages. How one language signs a certain number would be different from how another language signs it. The way sentences are constructed (syntax) differs from sign language to sign language, just as with different spoken languages. British Sign Language is described as a &#x27;spatial language&#x27; as it &quot;moves signs in space&quot;.

=== Phonology ===
Like many other sign languages, BSL phonology is defined by elements such as handshape, orientation, location, movement, and non-manual features. There are phonological components to sign language that have no meaning alone but work together to create a meaning of a signed word: hand shape, movement, location, orientation and facial expression. The meanings of words differ if one of these components is changed. Signs can be identical in certain components but different in others, giving each a different meaning. Facial expression falls under the nonmanual feature component of phonology. These include &quot;eyebrow height, eye gaze, mouthing, head movement, and torso rotation.&quot;

=== Grammar ===
In common with other languages, whether spoken or signed, BSL has its own grammar which govern how phrases are signed. BSL has a particular syntax. One important component of BSL is its use of proforms. A proform is &quot;...any form that stands in the place of, or does the job of, some other form.&quot; Sentences are composed of two parts, in order: the subject and the predicate. The subject is the topic of the sentence, while the predicate is the commentary about the subject. Question words are generally at the end of a sentence.

BSL uses a topic–comment structure. Topic-comment means that the topic of the signed conversation is first established, followed by an elaboration of the topic, being the &#x27;comment&#x27; component. The canonical word order outside of the topic–comment structure is object–subject–verb (OSV), and noun phrases are head-initial.

=== Relationships with other sign languages ===

Although the United Kingdom and the United States share English as the predominant spoken language, British Sign Language is quite distinct from American Sign Language (ASL), having only 31% signs identical, or 44% cognate. BSL is also distinct from Irish Sign Language (ISL) (ISG in the ISO system), which is more closely related to French Sign Language (LSF) and ASL.

It is also distinct from Signed English, a manually coded method expressed to represent the English language.

The sign languages used in Australia and New Zealand, Auslan and New Zealand Sign Language respectively, evolved largely from 19th century BSL, and all retain the same manual alphabet and grammar and possess similar lexicons. These three languages may technically be considered dialects of a single language (BANZSL) due to their use of the same grammar and manual alphabet and the high degree of lexical sharing (overlap of signs). The term BANZSL was coined by Trevor Johnston and Adam Schembri.

In Australia deaf schools were established by educated deaf people from London, Edinburgh and Dublin. This introduced the London and Edinburgh dialects of BSL to Melbourne and Sydney respectively and Irish Sign Language to Sydney in Roman Catholic schools for the deaf. The language contact post-secondary education between Australian ISL users and &#x27;Australian BSL&#x27; users accounts for some of the dialectal differences we see between modern BSL and Auslan. Tertiary education in the US for some deaf Australian adults also accounts for some ASL borrowings found in modern Auslan.

Auslan, BSL and NZSL have 82% of signs identical (using concepts from a Swadesh list). When considering similar or related signs as well as identical, they are 98% cognate. Further information will be available after completion of the BSL corpus, allows for comparison with the Auslan corpus, and the New Zealand Sign Language project. There continues to be language contact between BSL, Auslan and NZSL through migration (deaf people and interpreters), the media (television programmes such as See Hear, Switch, Rush and SignPost are often recorded and shared informally in all three countries) and conferences (in 1999 many deaf British people travelled to Australia for the World Federation of the Deaf Conference, WFD, in Brisbane.)

Makaton, a communication system for people with cognitive impairments or other communication difficulties, was originally developed with signs borrowed from British Sign Language. The sign language used in Sri Lanka is also closely related to BSL despite the oral language not being English, demonstrating variation in distance between sign languages and spoken ones.

== Usage ==

BSL has many regional dialects. Certain signs used in Scotland, for example, may not be understood immediately, or not understood at all, by those in Southern England, or vice versa. Some signs are even more local, occurring only in certain towns or cities (such as the Manchester system of number signs). Likewise, some may go in or out of fashion, or evolve over time, just as terms in oral languages do. Families may have signs unique to them to accommodate for certain situations or to describe an object that may otherwise require fingerspelling.

Many British television channels broadcast programmes with in-vision signing, using BSL, as well as specially made programmes aimed mainly at deaf people such as the BBC&#x27;s &quot;See Hear&quot; and Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;VEE-TV&quot;.

BBC News broadcasts in-vision signing at 06:45–07:30, 07:45–08:15, and 13:00–14:00 GMT/BST each weekday. 07:00–07:30 on the weekends. BBC Two also broadcasts in-vision signed repeats of the main channel&#x27;s primetime programmes between 00:00 and 05:00 each weekday and early Saturday mornings. Also provides signing on weekday mornings between 08:00 and 09:00. All BBC channels (excluding BBC One, BBC Alba and BBC Parliament) provide in-vision signing for some of their programmes. In 2024, over 10% of Channel 4&#x27;s programming was signed, including popular shows such as Hollyoaks and Gogglebox.

BSL is used in some educational establishments, but is not always the policy for deaf children in some local authority areas. The Let&#x27;s Sign BSL and fingerspelling graphics are being developed for use in education by deaf educators and tutors and include many of the regional signs referred to above.

In Northern Ireland, there are about 4,500 users of BSL and 1,500 users of Irish Sign Language, an unrelated sign language. A hybrid version, dubbed &quot;Northern Ireland Sign Language&quot;, is also used.

In 2019, over 100 signs for scientific terms, including &#x27;deoxyribonucleotide&#x27; and &#x27;deoxyribonucleoside&#x27;, were added to BSL, after being conceived by Liam Mcmulkin, a deaf graduate of the University of Dundee, who had found finger-spelling such words tiresome, during his degree course.

In 2016 the British Deaf Association (BDA) says that, based on official statistics, it believes there are 151,000 people who use BSL in the UK, and 87,000 of these are deaf. This figure does not include professional BSL users, interpreters, translators, etc. unless they use BSL at home.

== British Sign Language Dictionary ==
The British Sign Language Dictionary was compiled for the British Deaf Association by the Deaf Studies Research Unit at the University of Durham. It depicts over 1,800 signs through pictures and diagrams, each sign accompanied by definitions, explanations and usage. The signs are ordered not alphabetically, as a dictionary of the English language, but rather according to the phonological characteristics of the language. For example, signs that are based on the &quot;fist&quot; handshape come before signs based on the &quot;open hand&quot; handshape.

The dictionary was edited by David Brien, assisted by a team composed by Mary Brennan, Clark Denmark, Frances Elton, Liz Scott Gibson, Graham Turner and Dorothy Miles, among others.

The Dictionary was published in 1992. The foreword was written by Princess Diana, who was the patron of the BDA.

== Learning British Sign Language ==
British Sign Language can be learnt from formal institutions throughout the UK and three examination systems exist. Courses are provided by community colleges, local centres for deaf people and private organisations. A teaching qualification program was started by the British Deaf Association in 1984 at the University of Durham, called BSL Tutor Training Course, which closed in 1999.

National awarding organisations run training for BSL teachers. Each of these organisations has its own curriculum, teaching materials and resources.

In June 2023, the UK Government launched a consultation for a GCSE in British Sign Language which is planned to begin teaching in schools from September 2025.

=== Becoming a BSL / English interpreter ===
There are two qualification routes: via post-graduate studies, or via National Vocational Qualifications. Deaf studies undergraduate courses with specific streams for sign language interpreting exist at several British universities; post-graduate level interpreting diplomas are also on offer from universities and one private company. Course entry requirements vary from no previous knowledge of BSL to NVQ level 6 BSL (or equivalent).

The qualification process allows interpreters to register with the National Registers of Communication Professionals with Deaf and Deafblind People (NRCPD), a voluntary regulator. Registrants are asked to self-certify that they have both cleared a DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) check and are covered by professional indemnity insurance. Completing a level 3 BSL language assessment and enrolling on an approved interpreting course allows applications to register as a TSLI (Trainee Sign Language Interpreter). After completing an approved interpreting course, trainees can then apply to achieve RSLI (Registered Sign Language Interpreter) status. RSLIs are currently required by NRCPD to log Continuous Professional Development activities. Post-qualification, specialist training is still considered necessary to work in specific critical domains.

===Communication support workers===
Communication support workers (CSWs) are professionals who support the communication of deaf students in education at all ages, and deaf people in many areas of work, using British Sign Language and other communication methods such as Sign Supported English. The qualifications and experience of CSWs vary: some are fully qualified interpreters, others are not.

===BSL apps===
There are currently two well-established BSL language learning apps and web platforms: Bright BSL and Lingvano.

==Let Sign Shine !==
Let Sign Shine is a campaign started by Norfolk teenager Jade Chapman to raise the awareness of BSL and attract signatures for a petition for BSL to be taught in schools. The campaign&#x27;s petition to the Parliament of the United Kingdom attracted support from over four thousand people.

Chapman was nominated for the Bernard Matthews Youth Award 2014 for her work and devotion to raising awareness of the importance of sign language. Chapman won the education award category and was presented with an award by Olympic swimmer Rebecca Adlington.

Chapman was also awarded an Outstanding Achievement Award from the Radio Norwich 99.9 Local Hero Awards on 7 October 2015. The award ceremony featured a performance by Alesha Dixon.

Having been donated £1,000 from the Bernard Matthews Youth Award, Let Sign Shine used this to start a British Sign Language course at Dereham Neatherd High School.

<doc id="47641" wikidata="Q18338" url="?curid=47641" title="Standard Model">
<text>The Standard Model of particle physics is the theory describing three of the four known fundamental forces (electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions – excluding gravity) in the universe and classifying all known elementary particles. It was developed in stages throughout the latter half of the 20th century, through the work of many scientists worldwide, with the current formulation being finalized in the mid-1970s upon experimental confirmation of the existence of quarks. Since then, proof of the top quark (1995), the tau neutrino (2000), and the Higgs boson (2012) have added further credence to the Standard Model. In addition, the Standard Model has predicted various properties of weak neutral currents and the W and Z bosons with great accuracy.

Although the Standard Model is believed to be theoretically self-consistent and has demonstrated some success in providing experimental predictions, it leaves some physical phenomena unexplained and so falls short of being a complete theory of fundamental interactions. For example, it does not fully explain why there is more matter than anti-matter, incorporate the full theory of gravitation as described by general relativity, or account for the universe&#x27;s accelerating expansion as possibly described by dark energy. The model does not contain any viable dark matter particle that possesses all of the required properties deduced from observational cosmology. It also does not incorporate neutrino oscillations and their non-zero masses.

The development of the Standard Model was driven by theoretical and experimental particle physicists alike. The Standard Model is a paradigm of a quantum field theory for theorists, exhibiting a wide range of phenomena, including spontaneous symmetry breaking, anomalies, and non-perturbative behavior. It is used as a basis for building more exotic models that incorporate hypothetical particles, extra dimensions, and elaborate symmetries (such as supersymmetry) to explain experimental results at variance with the Standard Model, such as the existence of dark matter and neutrino oscillations.

== Historical background ==

In 1928, Paul Dirac introduced the Dirac equation, which implied the existence of antimatter.

In 1954, Yang Chen-Ning and Robert Mills extended the concept of gauge theory for abelian groups, e.g. quantum electrodynamics, to nonabelian groups to provide an explanation for strong interactions. In 1957, Chien-Shiung Wu demonstrated parity was not conserved in the weak interaction. 

In 1961, Sheldon Glashow combined the electromagnetic and weak interactions. In 1964, Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig introduced quarks and that same year Oscar W. Greenberg implicitly introduced color charge of quarks. In 1967 Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam incorporated the Higgs mechanism into Glashow&#x27;s electroweak interaction, giving it its modern form.

In 1970, Sheldon Glashow, John Iliopoulos, and Luciano Maiani introduced the GIM mechanism, predicting the charm quark. In 1973 Gross and Wilczek and Politzer independently discovered that non-Abelian gauge theories, like the color theory of the strong force, have asymptotic freedom. In 1976, Martin Perl discovered the tau lepton at the SLAC. In 1977, a team led by Leon Lederman at Fermilab discovered the bottom quark.

The Higgs mechanism is believed to give rise to the masses of all the elementary particles in the Standard Model. This includes the masses of the W and Z bosons, and the masses of the fermions, i.e. the quarks and leptons.

After the neutral weak currents caused by Z boson exchange were discovered at CERN in 1973, the electroweak theory became widely accepted and Glashow, Salam, and Weinberg shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering it. The W± and Z0 bosons were discovered experimentally in 1983; and the ratio of their masses was found to be as the Standard Model predicted.

The theory of the strong interaction (i.e. quantum chromodynamics, QCD), to which many contributed, acquired its modern form in 1973–74 when asymptotic freedom was proposed (a development that made QCD the main focus of theoretical research) and experiments confirmed that the hadrons were composed of fractionally charged quarks.

The term &quot;Standard Model&quot; was introduced by Abraham Pais and Sam Treiman in 1975, with reference to the electroweak theory with four quarks. Steven Weinberg has since claimed priority, explaining that he chose the term Standard Model out of a sense of modesty and used it in 1973 during a talk in Aix-en-Provence in France.

== Particle content ==
The Standard Model includes members of several classes of elementary particles, which in turn can be distinguished by other characteristics, such as color charge.

All particles can be summarized as follows:
=== Fermions ===
The Standard Model includes 12 elementary particles of spin , known as fermions. Fermions respect the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning that two identical fermions cannot simultaneously occupy the same quantum state in the same atom. Each fermion has a corresponding antiparticle, which are particles that have corresponding properties with the exception of opposite charges. Fermions are classified based on how they interact, which is determined by the charges they carry, into two groups: quarks and leptons. Within each group, pairs of particles that exhibit similar physical behaviors are then grouped into generations (see the table). Each member of a generation has a greater mass than the corresponding particle of generations prior. Thus, there are three generations of quarks and leptons. As first-generation particles do not decay, they comprise all of ordinary (baryonic) matter. Specifically, all atoms consist of electrons orbiting around the atomic nucleus, ultimately constituted of up and down quarks. On the other hand, second- and third-generation charged particles decay with very short half-lives and can only be observed in high-energy environments. Neutrinos of all generations also do not decay, and pervade the universe, but rarely interact with baryonic matter.

There are six quarks: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. Quarks carry color charge, and hence interact via the strong interaction. The color confinement phenomenon results in quarks being strongly bound together such that they form color-neutral composite particles called hadrons; quarks cannot individually exist and must always bind with other quarks. Hadrons can contain either a quark-antiquark pair (mesons) or three quarks (baryons). The lightest baryons are the nucleons: the proton and neutron. Quarks also carry electric charge and weak isospin, and thus interact with other fermions through electromagnetism and weak interaction. The six leptons consist of the electron, electron neutrino, muon, muon neutrino, tau, and tau neutrino. The leptons do not carry color charge, and do not respond to strong interaction. The charged leptons carry an electric charge of −1 &quot;e&quot;, while the three neutrinos carry zero electric charge. Thus, the neutrinos&#x27; motions are influenced by only the weak interaction and gravity, making them difficult to observe.

=== Gauge bosons ===
The Standard Model includes 4 kinds of gauge bosons of spin 1, with bosons being quantum particles containing an integer spin. The gauge bosons are defined as force carriers, as they are responsible for mediating the fundamental interactions. The Standard Model explains the four fundamental forces as arising from the interactions, with fermions exchanging virtual force carrier particles, thus mediating the forces. At a macroscopic scale, this manifests as a force. As a result, they do not follow the Pauli exclusion principle that constrains fermions; bosons do not have a theoretical limit on their spatial density. The types of gauge bosons are described below.
* Electromagnetism: Photons mediate the electromagnetic force, responsible for interactions between electrically charged particles. The photon is massless and is described by the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED).
* Strong Interactions: Gluons mediate the strong interactions, which binds quarks to each other by influencing the color charge, with the interactions being described in the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). They have no mass, and there are eight distinct gluons, with each being denoted through a color-anticolor charge combination (e.g. red–antigreen). As gluons have an effective color charge, they can also interact amongst themselves.
* Weak Interactions: The , , and gauge bosons mediate the weak interactions between all fermions, being responsible for radioactivity. They contain mass, with the having more mass than the . The weak interactions involving the act only on &quot;left-handed&quot; particles and &quot;right-handed&quot; antiparticles. The carries an electric charge of +1 and −1 and couples to the electromagnetic interaction. The electrically neutral boson interacts with both left-handed particles and right-handed antiparticles. These three gauge bosons along with the photons are grouped together, as collectively mediating the electroweak interaction.
* Gravity: It is currently unexplained in the Standard Model, as the hypothetical mediating particle graviton has been proposed, but not observed. This is due to the incompatibility of quantum mechanics and Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity, regarded as being the best explanation for gravity. In general relativity, gravity is explained as being the geometric curving of spacetime.
The Feynman diagram calculations, which are a graphical representation of the perturbation theory approximation, invoke &quot;force mediating particles&quot;, and when applied to analyze high-energy scattering experiments are in reasonable agreement with the data. However, perturbation theory (and with it the concept of a &quot;force-mediating particle&quot;) fails in other situations. These include low-energy quantum chromodynamics, bound states, and solitons. The interactions between all the particles described by the Standard Model are summarized by the diagrams on the right of this section.

=== Higgs boson ===
The Higgs particle is a massive scalar elementary particle theorized by Peter Higgs (and others) in 1964, when he showed that Goldstone&#x27;s 1962 theorem (generic continuous symmetry, which is spontaneously broken) provides a third polarisation of a massive vector field. Hence, Goldstone&#x27;s original scalar doublet, the massive spin-zero particle, was proposed as the Higgs boson, and is a key building block in the Standard Model. It has no intrinsic spin, and for that reason is classified as a boson with spin-0.

The Higgs boson plays a unique role in the Standard Model, by explaining why the other elementary particles, except the photon and gluon, are massive. In particular, the Higgs boson explains why the photon has no mass, while the W and Z bosons are very heavy. Elementary-particle masses and the differences between electromagnetism (mediated by the photon) and the weak force (mediated by the W and Z bosons) are critical to many aspects of the structure of microscopic (and hence macroscopic) matter. In electroweak theory, the Higgs boson generates the masses of the leptons (electron, muon, and tau) and quarks. As the Higgs boson is massive, it must interact with itself.

Because the Higgs boson is a very massive particle and also decays almost immediately when created, only a very high-energy particle accelerator can observe and record it. Experiments to confirm and determine the nature of the Higgs boson using the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN began in early 2010 and were performed at Fermilab&#x27;s Tevatron until its closure in late 2011. Mathematical consistency of the Standard Model requires that any mechanism capable of generating the masses of elementary particles must become visible at energies above ; therefore, the LHC (designed to collide two proton beams) was built to answer the question of whether the Higgs boson actually exists.

On 4 July 2012, two of the experiments at the LHC (ATLAS and CMS) both reported independently that they had found a new particle with a mass of about (about 133 proton masses, on the order of ), which is &quot;consistent with the Higgs boson&quot;. On 13 March 2013, it was confirmed to be the searched-for Higgs boson.

== Theoretical aspects ==
=== Construction of the Standard Model Lagrangian ===
Technically, quantum field theory provides the mathematical framework for the Standard Model, in which a Lagrangian controls the dynamics and kinematics of the theory. Each kind of particle is described in terms of a dynamical field that pervades space-time.
The construction of the Standard Model proceeds following the modern method of constructing most field theories: by first postulating a set of symmetries of the system, and then by writing down the most general renormalizable Lagrangian from its particle (field) content that observes these symmetries.

The global Poincaré symmetry is postulated for all relativistic quantum field theories. It consists of the familiar translational symmetry, rotational symmetry and the inertial reference frame invariance central to the theory of special relativity. The local SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1) gauge symmetry is an internal symmetry that essentially defines the Standard Model. Roughly, the three factors of the gauge symmetry give rise to the three fundamental interactions. The fields fall into different representations of the various symmetry groups of the Standard Model (see table). Upon writing the most general Lagrangian, one finds that the dynamics depends on 19 parameters, whose numerical values are established by experiment. The parameters are summarized in the table (made visible by clicking &quot;show&quot;) above.

The quantum chromodynamics (QCD) sector defines the interactions between quarks and gluons, which is a Yang–Mills gauge theory with SU(3) symmetry, generated by formula_1. Since leptons do not interact with gluons, they are not affected by this sector. The Dirac Lagrangian of the quarks coupled to the gluon fields is given by
formula_2
where formula_3 is a three component column vector of Dirac spinors, each element of which refers to a quark field with a specific color charge (i.e. red, blue, and green) and summation over flavor (i.e. up, down, strange, etc.) is implied. 

The gauge covariant derivative of QCD is defined by formula_4, where
* are the Dirac matrices,
* is the 8-component (formula_5) SU(3) gauge field,
* are the 3 × 3 Gell-Mann matrices, generators of the SU(3) color group,
* represents the gluon field strength tensor, and
* is the strong coupling constant.

The QCD Lagrangian is invariant under local SU(3) gauge transformations; i.e., transformations of the form formula_6, where formula_7 is 3 × 3 unitary matrix with determinant 1, making it a member of the group SU(3), and formula_8 is an arbitrary function of spacetime.

==== Electroweak sector ====

The electroweak sector is a Yang–Mills gauge theory with the symmetry group ,
formula_9
where the subscript formula_10 sums over the three generations of fermions; formula_11, and formula_12 are the left-handed doublet, right-handed singlet up type, and right handed singlet down type quark fields; and formula_13 and formula_14 are the left-handed doublet and right-handed singlet lepton fields. 

The electroweak gauge covariant derivative is defined as formula_15, where 
* is the U(1) gauge field,
* is the weak hypercharge – the generator of the U(1) group,
* is the 3-component SU(2) gauge field,
* are the Pauli matrices – infinitesimal generators of the SU(2) group – with subscript L to indicate that they only act on &quot;left&quot;-chiral fermions,
* and are the U(1) and SU(2) coupling constants respectively,
* formula_16 (formula_17) and formula_18 are the field strength tensors for the weak isospin and weak hypercharge fields.

Notice that the addition of fermion mass terms into the electroweak Lagrangian is forbidden, since terms of the form formula_19 do not respect gauge invariance. Neither is it possible to add explicit mass terms for the U(1) and SU(2) gauge fields. The Higgs mechanism is responsible for the generation of the gauge boson masses, and the fermion masses result from Yukawa-type interactions with the Higgs field.

==== Higgs sector ====

In the Standard Model, the Higgs field is an SU(2) doublet of complex scalar fields with four degrees of freedom:
formula_20
where the superscripts + and 0 indicate the electric charge formula_21 of the components. The weak hypercharge formula_22 of both components is 1. Before symmetry breaking, the Higgs Lagrangian is
formula_23
where formula_24 is the electroweak gauge covariant derivative defined above and formula_25 is the potential of the Higgs field. The square of the covariant derivative leads to three and four point interactions between the electroweak gauge fields formula_26 and formula_27 and the scalar field formula_28. The scalar potential is given by
formula_29
where formula_30, so that formula_28 acquires a non-zero Vacuum expectation value, which generates masses for the Electroweak gauge fields (the Higgs mechanism), and formula_32, so that the potential is bounded from below. The quartic term describes self-interactions of the scalar field formula_28.

The minimum of the potential is degenerate with an infinite number of equivalent ground state solutions, which occurs when formula_34. It is possible to perform a gauge transformation on formula_28 such that the ground state is transformed to a basis where formula_36 and formula_37. This breaks the symmetry of the ground state. The expectation value of formula_28 now becomes 
formula_39
where formula_40 has units of mass and sets the scale of electroweak physics. This is the only dimensional parameter of the Standard Model and has a measured value of ~. 

After symmetry breaking, the masses of the W and Z are given by formula_41 and formula_42, which can be viewed as predictions of the theory. The photon remains massless. The mass of the Higgs boson is formula_43. Since formula_44 and formula_45 are free parameters, the Higgs&#x27;s mass could not be predicted beforehand and had to be determined experimentally.

==== Yukawa sector ====
The Yukawa interaction terms are:
formula_46
where formula_47, formula_48, and formula_49 are matrices of Yukawa couplings, with the term giving the coupling of the generations and , and h.c. means Hermitian conjugate of preceding terms. The fields formula_50 and formula_13 are left-handed quark and lepton doublets. Likewise, formula_52 and formula_14 are right-handed up-type quark, down-type quark, and lepton singlets. Finally formula_28 is the Higgs doublet and formula_55 is its charge conjugate state.

The Yukawa terms are invariant under the SU(2) × U(1) gauge symmetry of the Standard Model and generate masses for all fermions after spontaneous symmetry breaking.

== Fundamental interactions ==

The Standard Model describes three of the four fundamental interactions in nature; only gravity remains unexplained. In the Standard Model, such an interaction is described as an exchange of bosons between the objects affected, such as a photon for the electromagnetic force and a gluon for the strong interaction. Those particles are called force carriers or messenger particles.

=== Gravity ===


Despite being perhaps the most familiar fundamental interaction, gravity is not described by the Standard Model, due to contradictions that arise when combining general relativity, the modern theory of gravity, and quantum mechanics. However, gravity is so weak at microscopic scales, that it is essentially unmeasurable. The graviton is postulated to be the mediating particle, but has not yet been proved to exist.

=== Electromagnetism ===

Electromagnetism is the only long-range force in the Standard Model. It is mediated by photons and couples to electric charge. Electromagnetism is responsible for a wide range of phenomena including atomic electron shell structure, chemical bonds, electric circuits and electronics. Electromagnetic interactions in the Standard Model are described by quantum electrodynamics.

=== Weak nuclear force ===

The weak interaction is responsible for various forms of particle decay, such as beta decay. It is weak and short-range, due to the fact that the weak mediating particles, W and Z bosons, have mass. W bosons have electric charge and mediate interactions that change the particle type (referred to as flavor) and charge. Interactions mediated by W bosons are charged current interactions. Z bosons are neutral and mediate neutral current interactions, which do not change particle flavor. Thus Z bosons are similar to the photon, aside from them being massive and interacting with the neutrino. The weak interaction is also the only interaction to violate parity and CP. Parity violation is maximal for charged current interactions, since the W boson interacts exclusively with left-handed fermions and right-handed antifermions.

In the Standard Model, the weak force is understood in terms of the electroweak theory, which states that the weak and electromagnetic interactions become united into a single &quot;electroweak&quot; interaction at high energies.

=== Strong nuclear force ===

The strong nuclear force is responsible for hadronic and nuclear binding. It is mediated by gluons, which couple to color charge. Since gluons themselves have color charge, the strong force exhibits confinement and asymptotic freedom. Confinement means that only color-neutral particles can exist in isolation, therefore quarks can only exist in hadrons and never in isolation, at low energies. Asymptotic freedom means that the strong force becomes weaker, as the energy scale increases. The strong force overpowers the electrostatic repulsion of protons and quarks in nuclei and hadrons respectively, at their respective scales.

While quarks are bound in hadrons by the fundamental strong interaction, which is mediated by gluons, nucleons are bound by an emergent phenomenon termed the &quot;residual strong force&quot; or &quot;nuclear force&quot;. This interaction is mediated by mesons, such as the pion. The color charges inside the nucleon cancel out, meaning most of the gluon and quark fields cancel out outside of the nucleon. However, some residue is &quot;leaked&quot;, which appears as the exchange of virtual mesons, that causes the attractive force between nucleons. The (fundamental) strong interaction is described by quantum chromodynamics, which is a component of the Standard Model.

== Tests and predictions ==
The Standard Model predicted the existence of the W and Z bosons, gluon, top quark and charm quark, and predicted many of their properties before these particles were observed. The predictions were experimentally confirmed with good precision.

The Standard Model also predicted the existence of the Higgs boson, which was found in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider, the final fundamental particle predicted by the Standard Model to be experimentally confirmed.

== Challenges ==

Self-consistency of the Standard Model (currently formulated as a non-abelian gauge theory quantized through path-integrals) has not been mathematically proved. While regularized versions useful for approximate computations (for example lattice gauge theory) exist, it is not known whether they converge (in the sense of S-matrix elements) in the limit that the regulator is removed. A key question related to the consistency is the Yang–Mills existence and mass gap problem.

Experiments indicate that neutrinos have mass, which the classic Standard Model did not allow. To accommodate this finding, the classic Standard Model can be modified to include neutrino mass, although it is not obvious exactly how this should be done.

If one insists on using only Standard Model particles, this can be achieved by adding a non-renormalizable interaction of leptons with the Higgs boson. On a fundamental level, such an interaction emerges in the seesaw mechanism where heavy right-handed neutrinos are added to the theory.
This is natural in the left-right symmetric extension of the Standard Model and in certain grand unified theories. As long as new physics appears below or around 1014 GeV, the neutrino masses can be of the right order of magnitude.

Theoretical and experimental research has attempted to extend the Standard Model into a unified field theory or a theory of everything, a complete theory explaining all physical phenomena including constants. Inadequacies of the Standard Model that motivate such research include:
* The model does not explain gravitation, although physical confirmation of a theoretical particle known as a graviton would account for it to a degree. Though it addresses strong and electroweak interactions, the Standard Model does not consistently explain the canonical theory of gravitation, general relativity, in terms of quantum field theory. The reason for this is, among other things, that quantum field theories of gravity generally break down before reaching the Planck scale. As a consequence, we have no reliable theory for the very early universe.
* Some physicists consider it to be &quot;ad hoc&quot; and inelegant, requiring 19 numerical constants whose values are unrelated and arbitrary. Although the Standard Model, as it now stands, can explain why neutrinos have masses, the specifics of neutrino mass are still unclear. It is believed that explaining neutrino mass will require an additional 7 or 8 constants, which are also arbitrary parameters.
* The Higgs mechanism gives rise to the hierarchy problem if some new physics (coupled to the Higgs) is present at high energy scales. In these cases, in order for the weak scale to be much smaller than the Planck scale, severe fine tuning of the parameters is required; there are, however, other scenarios that include quantum gravity in which such fine tuning can be avoided. There are also issues of quantum triviality, which suggests that it may not be possible to create a consistent quantum field theory involving elementary scalar particles.
* The model is inconsistent with the emerging Lambda-CDM model of cosmology. Contentions include the absence of an explanation in the Standard Model of particle physics for the observed amount of cold dark matter (CDM) and its contributions to dark energy, which are many orders of magnitude too large. It is also difficult to accommodate the observed predominance of matter over antimatter (matter/antimatter asymmetry). The isotropy and homogeneity of the visible universe over large distances seems to require a mechanism like cosmic inflation, which would also constitute an extension of the Standard Model.

Currently, no proposed theory of everything has been widely accepted or verified.

<doc id="47642" wikidata="Q102877" url="?curid=47642" title="Castling">
<text>Castling is a move in chess. It consists of moving the king two squares toward a rook on the same and then moving the rook to the square that the king passed over. Castling is permitted only if neither the king nor the rook has previously moved; the squares between the king and the rook are vacant; and the king does not leave, cross over, or finish on a square attacked by an enemy piece. Castling is the only move in chess in which two pieces are moved at once.

Castling with the is called &quot;kingside castling&quot;, and castling with the is called &quot;queenside castling&quot;. In both algebraic and descriptive notations, castling kingside is written as 0-0 and castling queenside as 0-0-0.

Castling originates from the &quot;king&#x27;s leap&quot;, a two-square king move added to European chess between the 14th and 15th centuries, and took on its present form in the 17th century. Local variations in castling rules were common, however, persisting in Italy until the late 19th century. Castling does not exist in Asian games of the chess family, such as shogi, xiangqi, and janggi, but it commonly appears in variants of Western chess.
==Rules==

===Description===
During castling, the king is shifted two squares toward a rook of the same color on the same rank, and the rook is transferred to the square crossed by the king. There are two forms of castling:
* Castling (&quot;short castling&quot;) consists of moving the king to g1 and the rook to f1 for White, or moving the king to g8 and the rook to f8 for Black.
* Castling (&quot;long castling&quot;) consists of moving the king to c1 and the rook to d1 for White, or moving the king to c8 and the rook to d8 for Black.

===Requirements===




Castling is permitted provided all of the following conditions are met:
# Neither the king nor the rook has previously moved.
# There are no pieces between the king and the rook.
# The king is not currently in check.
# The king does not pass through or finish on a square that is attacked by an enemy piece.

Conditions 3 and 4 can be summarized by the mnemonic: 

Castling rules often cause confusion, even occasionally among high-level players. Alexander Beliavsky and Viktor Korchnoi both had to consult the arbiter during tournaments on whether castling was legal when the rook was on or passed over an attacked square, Yuri Averbakh once mistakenly thought that Black queenside castling was illegal when b8 was attacked, and Nigel Short once attempted to castle queenside as Black when d8 was under attack (this was not allowed). Illegal castling has also occasionally occurred in serious games between top players (including Gata Kamsky, Viktor Korchnoi, and Richard Réti) when they forgot that the king or rook had previously moved and returned to its home square, and has not always been noticed by the opponent. Yasser Seirawan once accidentally castled queenside as White with his queen&#x27;s rook on b1 (which was not allowed), and Alexander Alekhine once &quot;castled his queen&quot; (moving his queen from d1 to b1 and his rook from a1 to c1, which was also not allowed). To clarify:
* The rook can be under attack.
* The rook can pass through an attacked square. (White can castle queenside even if Black is attacking b1; Black can castle queenside even if White is attacking b8.)
* The king can have been in check earlier in the game.

Under FIDE rules and USCF rules, and enforced in most tournaments, castling is considered a king move, so the king must be touched first; if the rook is touched first, a rook move must be played instead. As usual, the player may choose another legal destination square for the king until releasing it. When the two-square king move is completed, however, the player is committed to castling if it is legal, and the rook must be moved accordingly. The entire move must be completed with one hand. A player who attempts to castle illegally must return the king and rook to their original squares and then make a legal king move if possible (which may include castling on the other side). If there is no legal king move, the touch-move rule does not apply to the rook.

These tournament rules are not commonly enforced in nor commonly known by casual players.

===Castling rights===
An unmoved king has &quot;castling rights&quot; with an unmoved rook of the same color on the same rank, even if castling is not legal in that particular position. In the context of threefold and fivefold repetition, two otherwise identical positions with different castling rights are considered to be different positions.

====Example of castling rights====

In a 1986 game between Anatoly Karpov and Tony Miles, play continued from the diagrammed position as follows:

: 22. ... Ra4
: 23. Nc3 Ra8
: 24. Nb5 Ra4
: 25. Nc3 Ra8
: 26. Nb5

With his 26th move, Karpov attempted to claim a draw by threefold repetition, thinking that the positions after his 22nd, 24th, and 26th moves were the same. It was pointed out to him, however, that the position after his 22nd move had different castling rights than the positions after his 24th and 26th moves (the rook being unmoved prior to 22. ... Ra4, meaning Black still had castling rights in that position), rendering his claim illegal. As a result, Karpov was penalized five minutes on his clock. After thinking for about ten minutes, Miles decided to agree to a draw anyway (even an incorrect claim of threefold repetition is also a draw offer).
==Notation==
Both algebraic notation and descriptive notation indicate kingside castling as 0-0 and queenside castling as 0-0-0 (using the digit zero). Portable Game Notation and some publications use O-O for kingside castling and O-O-O for queenside castling (using the letter O) instead. ICCF numeric notation indicates castling based on the starting and ending squares of the king; thus, castling kingside is written as 5171 for White and 5878 for Black, and castling queenside is written as 5131 for White and 5838 for Black.

==History==
Castling has its roots in the &quot;king&#x27;s leap&quot;. There were two forms of the leap: the king would move once like a knight, or the king would move two squares on its first move. The knight move might be used early in the game to get the king to safety or later in the game to escape a threat. This second form was played in Europe as early as the 13th century. In North Africa, the king was transferred to a safe square by a two-move procedure: the king moved to the player&#x27;s second , and the rook and king moved to each other&#x27;s original squares.

Various forms of castling were developed due to the spread of rulesets during the 15th and 16th centuries which increased the power of the queen and bishop, allowing these pieces to attack from a distance and from both sides of the board, thus increasing the importance of king safety.

The rule of castling has varied by location and time. In medieval England, Spain, and France, the white king was allowed to jump to c1, c2, d3, e3, f3, or g1 if no capture was made and the king was not in check and did not move over check; the black king might move analogously. In Lombardy, the white king might also jump to a2, b1, or h1, with corresponding squares applying to the black king. Later, in Germany and Italy, the rule was changed such that the king move was accompanied by a pawn move.

In the Göttingen manuscript (c. 1500) and a game published by Luis Ramírez de Lucena in 1498, castling consisted of moving the rook and then moving the king on separate moves.

The current version of castling was established in France in 1620 and in England in 1640. It served to combine the rook&#x27;s move and the king&#x27;s jumping move into a single move.

In Rome, from the early 17th century until the late 19th century, the rook might be placed on any square up to and including the king&#x27;s square, and the king might be moved to any square on the other side of the rook. This was called &quot;free castling&quot;.

In the 1811 edition of his chess treatise, Johann Allgaier introduced the 0-0 notation. He differentiated between 0-0r (right) and 0-0l (left). The 0-0-0 notation for queenside castling was introduced in 1837 by Aaron Alexandre. The practice was adopted in the first edition (1843) of the influential &quot;Handbuch des Schachspiels&quot; and soon became standard. In English descriptive notation, the word &quot;Castles&quot; was originally spelled out, adding &quot;K&#x27;s R&quot; or &quot;Q&#x27;s R&quot; if disambiguation was needed; eventually, the 0-0 and 0-0-0 notation was borrowed from the algebraic system.

==Strategic and tactical concepts==

===Strategy===

Castling is generally an important goal in the opening: it moves the king to safety away from the of the board, and it moves the rook to a more active position (the f-file if castling kingside; the d-file if castling queenside).

The choice regarding to which side one castles often hinges on an assessment of the trade-off between king safety and activity of the rook. Kingside castling is generally slightly safer because the king ends up closer to the edge of the board and can usually defend all of the pawns on the castled side. In queenside castling, the king is placed closer to the center and does not defend the pawn on the a-; for these reasons, the king is often subsequently moved to the b-file. In addition, queenside castling is initially obstructed by more pieces than kingside castling, thus taking longer to set up than kingside castling. On the other hand, queenside castling places the rook more efficiently on the central d-file, where it is often immediately active; meanwhile, with kingside castling, a tempo may be required to move the rook to a more effective square.

Players may forgo castling for various reasons. In positions where the opponent cannot organize an attack against a centralized king, castling may be unnecessary or even detrimental. In addition, in certain situations, a rook can be more active near the edges of the board than in the center; for example, if it is able to fight for control of an open or semi-open file.

Kingside castling occurs more frequently than queenside castling. It is common for both players to castle kingside, less common for one player to castle kingside and the other queenside, and uncommon for both players to castle queenside. If one player castles kingside and the other queenside, it is called &quot;opposite castling&quot; or &quot;opposite-side castling&quot;. Castling on opposite sides usually results in a fierce fight, as each player&#x27;s pawns are free to advance to attack the opponent&#x27;s castled position without exposing the player&#x27;s own castled king. Opposite castling is a common feature of many openings, such as the Yugoslav Attack.

===Tactics involving castling===
Tactical patterns involving castling are rare. One pattern involves castling queenside to deliver a : the king attacks a rook (on b2 for White or b7 for Black), while the rook attacks a second enemy piece (usually the king). In the example shown, from the game Mattison–Millers, Königsberg 1926, Black played 13...Rxb2 and resigned after 14.0-0-0+, which wins the rook.

Chess historian Edward Winter has proposed the name &quot;Thornton castling trap&quot; for this pattern, in reference to the earliest known example, Thornton–Boultbee, published in the &quot;Brooklyn Chess Chronicle&quot; in 1884. Other chess writers such as Gary Lane have since adopted this term.


Another example of tactical castling is illustrated in the diagrammed position from the correspondence game Gurvich–Pampin, 1976. After 1.Qxd8+ Kxd8 2.0-0-0+ Ke7 3.Nxb5, White has won a rook by castling with check and simultaneously unpinning the knight.


Such a double attack can also be made by castling kingside, although this is much rarer. In this position from the blindfold game , 2007, the move 19...0-0 threatens to win the rook on h7, as well as 20...Bxg5, when White cannot recapture due to the threat of back rank mate. Black will thus win the g5-knight next move; 20.Rh6 Bxg5 21.Rxg6+ Kh7 22.Rxg5 would not work, as it would be met by 22...Rf1.
==Examples==

===Korchnoi vs. Karpov===
Viktor Korchnoi, in his 1974 Candidates final match with Anatoly Karpov, asked the arbiter if castling was legal when the castling rook was under attack. The arbiter answered in the affirmative, Korchnoi executed the move, and Karpov resigned shortly after. 

===Heidenfeld vs. Kerins===
Castling occurred three times in the game Wolfgang Heidenfeld–Nick Kerins, Dublin 1973. The third instance of castling, the second one by White, was illegal, as the white king had already moved. The game is as follows:
===Averbakh vs. Purdy===

In the game Yuri Averbakh–Cecil Purdy, Adelaide 1960, when Purdy castled queenside, Averbakh queried the move, pointing out that the rook had passed over an attacked square. Purdy indicated e8 and c8 and said, &quot;The king&quot;, in an attempt to explain that this was forbidden only for the king. Averbakh replied, &quot;Only the king? Not the rook?&quot; Averbakh&#x27;s colleague Vladimir Bagirov then explained the castling rules to him in Russian, and the game continued.
===Edward Lasker vs. Thomas===

In the game Edward Lasker–Sir George Thomas (London 1912), White could have checkmated with 18.0-0-0, but he instead played 18.Kd2#. (See Edward Lasker&#x27;s notable games.)
===Prins vs. Day===

The diagram shows the final position of the game Lodewijk Prins–Lawrence Day (1968), where White resigned. Had the game continued, Black could have checkmated by castling:

:29. Kf6 Qf5+ 30. Kg7 Qg6+ 31. Kh8 0-0-0

(See Lawrence Day&#x27;s notable chess games.)
===Feuer vs. O&#x27;Kelly===
In the 1934 Belgian Championship, Otto Feuer caught Albéric O&#x27;Kelly in the Thornton castling trap. In the position in the diagram, the game continued 10...Rxb2 11.dxe5 dxe5?? 12.Qxd8+ Kxd8 13.0-0-0+, and O&#x27;Kelly resigned. Feuer&#x27;s last move simultaneously gave check and attacked the rook on b2.
===Fischer vs. Najdorf===

The diagram illustrates the consequences of losing castling rights. Fischer, with the white pieces, played 16.Ng7+ Ke7 17.Nf5+ Ke8. Although all the pieces were now on the same squares, the two positions were not identical because Black, having moved his king, no longer had the right to castle. White now had time to build pressure on the black king without worrying that the king might escape by castling.
==Artificial castling==
&quot;Artificial castling&quot;, also known as &quot;castling by hand&quot;, is a maneuver whereby a player achieves a castled position without the use of castling.

===Example of artificial castling===



In the first diagram (arising from the Ruy Lopez, Classical Defence):
:1. Nxe5 Bxf2+
Black sees that if he plays 1...Nxe5, White responds with 2.d4, winning back the minor piece with a fork and taking control of the center. Instead of allowing this, Black hopes to cause trouble for White by returning the piece while depriving White of the right to castle. White can easily castle artificially, however. For example:
:2. Kxf2 Nxe5 3. Rf1
White begins castling artificially.
:3... Ne7 4. Kg1 (second diagram)
White has achieved a normal castled position via several moves. With the bishop pair and a central pawn majority, White has a slight advantage.
==Castling in chess variants==
Variants of Western chess often include castling in their rulesets, sometimes in a modified form.

In variants played on a standard 8×8 board, castling is often the same as in standard chess. This includes variants that replace the king with a different royal piece, as is the case with the knight in Knightmate. Some variants, however, have different rules; for example, in Chess960, the king may move more or fewer than two squares (including none) when castling, depending on the starting position. Former world Fischer Random Chess Champion Wesley So was confused by the castling rules during the 2022 championships, and attempted to illegally castle out of check versus Ian Nepomniachtchi.

Castling can also be adapted to variants with different board sizes and shapes. Some such variants, like Capablanca chess (10×8) or chess on a really big board (16×16), preserve the castling movement of the rooks, meaning that the king moves a different distance along the . In a few variants, most notably Wildebeest chess (11×10), the player may choose to move the king any distance and move the rook accordingly.

Castling sometimes features in chess variants not played on a square grid, such as masonic chess, triangular chess, Shafran&#x27;s and Brusky&#x27;s hexagonal chess, and millennium 3D chess. In &quot;5D Chess with Multiverse Time Travel&quot;, castling is possible within the spatial dimensions but not across time or between timelines.

Some chess variants do not feature castling, such as losing chess, where the king is not , and Grand Chess, where the rooks have significantly more opening mobility.

In a handicap game with rook odds, the player giving odds may castle with the absent rook, moving only the king.

===Chess without castling===
Writing in 2019, former world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik proposed a variant of chess without castling. This variant would reduce king safety, theoretically leading to more dynamic games, as it would be considerably harder to force a draw and the pieces would be forced to engage in a mêlée. In 2021, former world champion Viswanathan Anand defeated Kramnik 2½–1½ in a no-castling exhibition match under classical time controls.

==Castling in chess problems==
Castling features in some chess problems. The earliest known study containing castling was published in 1843 by Julius Mendheim. 

===Retrograde analysis===
Castling is common in retrograde analysis problems. By chess problem convention, if a player&#x27;s king and rook are on their original squares, the player is assumed to have castling rights unless it can be proved otherwise. In some retrograde analysis problems, the solver (who usually plays White) is required to prove that the opponent has previously moved their king or rook and therefore cannot castle. This is sometimes accomplished by castling or by capturing &quot;en passant&quot;, thereby disproving other possible game histories.
The diagram shows a mate in two. 1.Rad1 0-0 does not work. The is 1.0-0-0 This demonstrates that the white king has not moved yet and that the rook on d4 must therefore be a promoted piece. Therefore, either the black king or black rook has previously moved to let the white rook off the back rank. Therefore Black cannot castle. After any move by Black, 2.Rd8 is mate.
===Novelty problems===

Some joke chess problems involve castling with a promoted rook of the opponent&#x27;s color. In orthodox chess, this would be illegal since the rook would be giving check to the king, but under fairy chess conditions, this might not actually be check.

The diagrammed problem involves castling with an opposing rook under the Koko fairy condition (each piece must end up adjacent to another piece when moving). The solution (Black&#x27;s move being given first per helpmate convention) is:
:1. Bg7 h8=R 2. Bf6 Kg6 3. 0-0 Kh7#

where, after 3.0-0, White&#x27;s rook is not checking the king; a hypothetical capture of the king would result in the rook not being adjacent to any other piece, which is illegal under the Koko condition.

The allowance of castling with a &quot;phantom rook&quot; in handicap games has also been used in joke problems. Many other joke variations on castling are possible.
====Vertical castling====
In 1907, C. Staugaard composed a two-mover in which White promotes a pawn to a rook and then castles vertically with the newly promoted rook (placing the king on e3 and the rook on e2), since the rook has not moved. In the position on the right, White plays 1.e8=R, and after the forced move 1...Kxc2 castles vertically with the promoted rook, checkmating Black.

Vertical castling, also known as &quot;Staugaard castling&quot; or &quot;Pam–Krabbé castling&quot;, has been used in a few novelty chess problems.

Tim Krabbé&#x27;s 1985 book &quot;Chess Curiosities&quot; includes a problem featuring vertical castling, along with an incorrect claim that the problem&#x27;s 1973 publication prompted FIDE to amend the castling laws in 1974 to add the requirement that the king and rook be on the same rank. In reality, the original FIDE Laws from 1930 explicitly stated that castling must be done with a king and a rook on the same rank (&quot;traverse&quot; in French). It is unclear whether any historically published sets of rules would technically allow such a move.
==Nomenclature==
In most European languages, the term for castling is derived from the Persian &quot;rukh&quot; (e.g. &quot;rochieren&quot;, &quot;rochada&quot;, &quot;enroque&quot;), while queenside and kingside castling are referred to using the adjectives meaning &quot;long&quot; and &quot;short&quot; (or &quot;big&quot; and &quot;small&quot;), respectively.

<doc id="47643" wikidata="Q44272" url="?curid=47643" title="Michel Foucault">
<text>Paul-Michel Foucault ( , ; ; 15 October 192625 June 1984) was a French historian of ideas and philosopher who was also an author, literary critic, political activist, and teacher. Foucault&#x27;s theories primarily addressed the relationships between power versus knowledge and liberty, and he analyzed how they are used as a form of social control through multiple institutions. Though often cited as a structuralist and postmodernist, Foucault rejected these labels and sought to critique authority without limits on himself. His thought has influenced academics within a large number of contrasting areas of study, with this especially including those working in anthropology, communication studies, criminology, cultural studies, feminism, literary theory, psychology, and sociology. His efforts against homophobia and racial prejudice as well as against other ideological doctrines have also shaped research into critical theory and Marxism–Leninism alongside other topics.

Born in Poitiers, France, into an upper-middle-class family, Foucault was educated at the Lycée Henri-IV, at the , where he developed an interest in philosophy and came under the influence of his tutors Jean Hyppolite and Louis Althusser, and at the University of Paris (Sorbonne), where he earned degrees in philosophy and psychology. After several years as a cultural diplomat abroad, he returned to France and published his first major book, &quot;The History of Madness&quot; (1961). After obtaining work between 1960 and 1966 at the University of Clermont-Ferrand, he produced &quot;The Birth of the Clinic&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Order of Things&quot; (1966), publications that displayed his increasing involvement with structuralism, from which he later distanced himself. These first three histories exemplified a historiographical technique Foucault was developing, which he called &quot;archaeology&quot;.

From 1966 to 1968, Foucault lectured at the University of Tunis before returning to France, where he became head of the philosophy department at the new experimental university of Paris VIII. Foucault subsequently published &quot;The Archaeology of Knowledge&quot; (1969). In 1970, Foucault was admitted to the Collège de France, a membership he retained until his death. He also became active in several left-wing groups involved in campaigns against racism and other violations of human rights, focusing on struggles such as penal reform. Foucault later published &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot; (1975) and &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot; (1976), in which he developed archaeological and genealogical methods that emphasized the role that power plays in society.

Foucault died in Paris from complications of HIV/AIDS. He became the first public figure in France to die from complications of the disease, with his charisma and career influence changing mass awareness of the pandemic. This occurrence influenced HIV/AIDS activism; his partner, Daniel Defert, founded the AIDES charity in his memory. It continues to campaign as of 2024 despite the deaths of both Defert (in 2023) and Foucault (in 1984).

==Early life==

===Early years: 1926–1938===
Paul-Michel Foucault was born on 15 October 1926 in the city of Poitiers, west-central France, as the second of three children in a prosperous, socially conservative, upper-middle-class family. Family tradition prescribed naming him after his father, Paul Foucault (1893–1959), but his mother insisted on the addition of Michel; referred to as Paul at school, he expressed a preference for &quot;Michel&quot; throughout his life.

His father, a successful local surgeon born in Fontainebleau, moved to Poitiers, where he set up his own practice. He married Anne Malapert, the daughter of prosperous surgeon Dr. Prosper Malapert, who owned a private practice and taught anatomy at the University of Poitiers&#x27; School of Medicine. Paul Foucault eventually took over his father-in-law&#x27;s medical practice, while Anne took charge of their large mid-19th-century house, Le Piroir, in the village of Vendeuvre-du-Poitou. Together the couple had three children—a girl named Francine and two boys, Paul-Michel and Denys—who all shared the same fair hair and bright blue eyes. The children were raised to be nominal Catholics, attending mass at the Church of Saint-Porchair, and while Michel briefly became an altar boy, none of the family was devout. Michel is not related to the physicist Léon Foucault.

In later life, Foucault revealed very little about his childhood. Describing himself as a &quot;juvenile delinquent&quot;, he said his father was a &quot;bully&quot; who sternly punished him. In 1930, two years early, Foucault began his schooling at the local Lycée Henry-IV. There he undertook two years of elementary education before entering the main &quot;lycée&quot;, where he stayed until 1936. Afterwards, he took his first four years of secondary education at the same establishment, excelling in French, Greek, Latin, and history, though doing poorly at mathematics, including arithmetic.

=== Teens to young adulthood: 1939–1945 ===
In 1939, the Second World War began, followed by Nazi Germany&#x27;s occupation of France in 1940. Foucault&#x27;s parents opposed the occupation and the Vichy regime, but did not join the Resistance. That year, Foucault&#x27;s mother enrolled him in the Collège Saint-Stanislas, a strict Catholic institution run by the Jesuits. Although he later described his years there as an &quot;ordeal&quot;, Foucault excelled academically, particularly in philosophy, history, and literature. In 1942 he entered his final year, the &quot;terminale&quot;, where he focused on the study of philosophy, earning his &quot;baccalauréat&quot; in 1943.

Returning to the local Lycée Henry-IV, he studied history and philosophy for a year, aided by a personal tutor, the philosopher Louis Girard. Rejecting his father&#x27;s wishes that he become a surgeon, in 1945 Foucault went to Paris, where he enrolled in one of the country&#x27;s most prestigious secondary schools, which was also known as the Lycée Henri-IV. Here he studied under the philosopher Jean Hyppolite, an existentialist and expert on the work of 19th-century German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Hyppolite had devoted himself to uniting existentialist theories with the dialectical theories of Hegel and Karl Marx. These ideas influenced Foucault, who adopted Hyppolite&#x27;s conviction that philosophy must develop through a study of history.

===University studies: 1946–1951===
In autumn 1946, attaining excellent results, Foucault was admitted to the élite (ENS), for which he undertook exams and an oral interrogation by Georges Canguilhem and Pierre-Maxime Schuhl to gain entry. Of the hundred students entering the ENS, Foucault ranked fourth based on his entry results, and encountered the highly competitive nature of the institution. Like most of his classmates, he lived in the school&#x27;s communal dormitories on the Parisian Rue d&#x27;Ulm.

He remained largely unpopular, spending much time alone, reading voraciously. His fellow students noted his love of violence and the macabre; he decorated his bedroom with images of torture and war drawn during the Napoleonic Wars by Spanish artist Francisco Goya, and on one occasion chased a classmate with a dagger. Prone to self-harm, in 1948 Foucault allegedly attempted suicide; his father sent him to see the psychiatrist Jean Delay at the Sainte-Anne Hospital Center. Obsessed with the idea of self-mutilation and suicide, Foucault attempted the latter several times in ensuing years, praising suicide in later writings. The ENS&#x27;s doctor examined Foucault&#x27;s state of mind, suggesting that his suicidal tendencies emerged from the distress surrounding his homosexuality, because same-sex sexual activity was socially taboo in France. At the time, Foucault engaged in homosexual activity with men whom he encountered in the underground Parisian gay scene, also indulging in drug use; according to biographer James Miller, he enjoyed the thrill and sense of danger that these activities offered him.

Although studying various subjects, Foucault soon gravitated towards philosophy, reading not only Hegel and Marx but also Immanuel Kant, Edmund Husserl and most significantly, Martin Heidegger. He began reading the publications of philosopher Gaston Bachelard, taking a particular interest in his work exploring the history of science. He graduated from the ENS with a B.A. (licence) in Philosophy in 1948 and a &quot;Diplôme d&#x27;études supérieures&quot; (&quot;DES&quot;), roughly equivalent to an M.A.) in Philosophy in 1949. His DES thesis under the direction of Hyppolite was titled &quot;La Constitution d&#x27;un transcendental dans La Phénoménologie de l&#x27;esprit de Hegel&quot; (&quot;The Constitution of a Historical Transcendental in Hegel&#x27;s Phenomenology of Spirit&quot;).

In 1948, the philosopher Louis Althusser became a tutor at the ENS. A Marxist, he influenced both Foucault and a number of other students, encouraging them to join the French Communist Party. Foucault did so in 1950, but never became particularly active in its activities, and never adopted an orthodox Marxist viewpoint, rejecting core Marxist tenets such as class struggle. He soon became dissatisfied with the bigotry that he experienced within the party&#x27;s ranks; he personally faced homophobia and was appalled by the anti-semitism exhibited during the 1952–53 &quot;Doctors&#x27; plot&quot; in the Soviet Union. He left the Communist Party in 1953, but remained Althusser&#x27;s friend and defender for the rest of his life. Although failing at the first attempt in 1950, he passed his &quot;agrégation&quot; in philosophy on the second try, in 1951. Excused from national service on medical grounds, he decided to start a doctorate at the Fondation Thiers in 1951, focusing on the philosophy of psychology, but he relinquished it after only one year in 1952.

Foucault was also interested in psychology and he attended Daniel Lagache&#x27;s lectures at the University of Paris, where he obtained a B.A. (licence) in psychology in 1949 and a &quot;Specialist Diploma in Psychopathology&quot; (&quot;Diplôme de psychopathologie&quot;) from the university&#x27;s institute of psychology (now called the Institut de psychologie de l&#x27;université Paris Descartes} in June 1952.

==Early career (1951–1960)==
=== France: 1951–1955 ===
Over the following few years, Foucault embarked on a variety of research and teaching jobs. From 1951 to 1955, he worked as a psychology instructor at the ENS at Althusser&#x27;s invitation. In Paris, he shared a flat with his brother, who was training to become a surgeon, but for three days in the week commuted to the northern town of Lille, teaching psychology at the Université de Lille from 1953 to 1954. Many of his students liked his lecturing style. Meanwhile, he continued working on his thesis, visiting the Bibliothèque Nationale every day to read the work of psychologists such as Ivan Pavlov, Jean Piaget and Karl Jaspers. Undertaking research at the psychiatric institute of the Sainte-Anne Hospital, he became an unofficial intern, studying the relationship between doctor and patient and aiding experiments in the electroencephalographic laboratory. Foucault adopted many of the theories of the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, undertaking psychoanalytical interpretation of his dreams and making friends undergo Rorschach tests.

Embracing the Parisian avant-garde, Foucault entered into a romantic relationship with the serialist composer Jean Barraqué. Together, they tried to produce their greatest work, heavily used recreational drugs and engaged in sado-masochistic sexual activity. In August 1953, Foucault and Barraqué holidayed in Italy, where the philosopher immersed himself in &quot;Untimely Meditations&quot; (1873–1876), a set of four essays by the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Later describing Nietzsche&#x27;s work as &quot;a revelation&quot;, he felt that reading the book deeply affected him, being a watershed moment in his life. Foucault subsequently experienced another groundbreaking self-revelation when watching a Parisian performance of Samuel Beckett&#x27;s new play, &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, in 1953.

Interested in literature, Foucault was an avid reader of the philosopher Maurice Blanchot&#x27;s book reviews published in &quot;Nouvelle Revue Française&quot;. Enamoured of Blanchot&#x27;s literary style and critical theories, in later works he adopted Blanchot&#x27;s technique of &quot;interviewing&quot; himself. Foucault also came across Hermann Broch&#x27;s 1945 novel &quot;The Death of Virgil&quot;, a work that obsessed both him and Barraqué. While the latter attempted to convert the work into an epic opera, Foucault admired Broch&#x27;s text for its portrayal of death as an affirmation of life. The couple took a mutual interest in the work of such authors as the Marquis de Sade, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Franz Kafka and Jean Genet, all of whose works explored the themes of sex and violence.

Interested in the work of Swiss psychologist Ludwig Binswanger, Foucault aided family friend Jacqueline Verdeaux in translating his works into French. Foucault was particularly interested in Binswanger&#x27;s studies of Ellen West who, like himself, had a deep obsession with suicide, eventually killing herself. In 1954, Foucault authored an introduction to Binswanger&#x27;s paper &quot;Dream and Existence&quot;, in which he argued that dreams constituted &quot;the birth of the world&quot; or &quot;the heart laid bare&quot;, expressing the mind&#x27;s deepest desires. That same year, Foucault published his first book, &quot;Maladie mentale et personalité&quot; (&quot;Mental Illness and Personality&quot;), in which he exhibited his influence from both Marxist and Heideggerian thought, covering a wide range of subject matter from the reflex psychology of Pavlov to the classic psychoanalysis of Freud. Referencing the work of sociologists and anthropologists such as Émile Durkheim and Margaret Mead, he presented his theory that illness was culturally relative. Biographer James Miller noted that while the book exhibited &quot;erudition and evident intelligence&quot;, it lacked the &quot;kind of fire and flair&quot; which Foucault exhibited in subsequent works. It was largely critically ignored, receiving only one review at the time. Foucault grew to despise it, unsuccessfully attempting to prevent its republication and translation into English.

===Sweden, Poland, and West Germany: 1955–1960===
Foucault spent the next five years abroad, first in Sweden, working as cultural diplomat at the University of Uppsala, a job obtained through his acquaintance with historian of religion Georges Dumézil. At Uppsala he was appointed a Reader in French language and literature, while simultaneously working as director of the Maison de France, thus opening the possibility of a cultural-diplomatic career. Although finding it difficult to adjust to the &quot;Nordic gloom&quot; and long winters, he developed close friendships with two Frenchmen, biochemist Jean-François Miquel and physicist Jacques Papet-Lépine, and entered into romantic and sexual relationships with various men. In Uppsala he became known for his heavy alcohol consumption and reckless driving in his new Jaguar car. In spring 1956 Barraqué broke from his relationship with Foucault, announcing that he wanted to leave the &quot;vertigo of madness&quot;. In Uppsala, Foucault spent much of his spare time in the university&#x27;s Carolina Rediviva library, making use of their Bibliotheca Walleriana collection of texts on the history of medicine for his ongoing research. Finishing his doctoral thesis, Foucault hoped that Uppsala University would accept it, but Sten Lindroth, a positivistic historian of science there, remained unimpressed, asserting that it was full of speculative generalisations and was a poor work of history; he refused to allow Foucault to be awarded a doctorate at Uppsala. In part because of this rejection, Foucault left Sweden. Later, Foucault admitted that the work was a first draft with certain lack of quality.

Again at Dumézil&#x27;s behest, in October 1958 Foucault arrived in the capital of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, Warsaw and took charge of the University of Warsaw&#x27;s Centre Français. Foucault found life in Poland difficult due to the lack of material goods and services following the destruction of the Second World War. Witnessing the aftermath of the Polish October of 1956, when students had protested against the governing communist Polish United Workers&#x27; Party, he felt that most Poles despised their government as a puppet regime of the Soviet Union, and thought that the system ran &quot;badly&quot;. Considering the university a liberal enclave, he traveled the country giving lectures; proving popular, he adopted the position of &quot;de facto&quot; cultural attaché. Like France and Sweden, Poland legally tolerated but socially frowned on homosexual activity, and Foucault undertook relationships with a number of men; one was with a Polish security agent who hoped to trap Foucault in an embarrassing situation, which therefore would reflect badly on the French embassy. Wracked in diplomatic scandal, he was ordered to leave Poland for a new destination. Various positions were available in West Germany, and so Foucault relocated to the Institut français Hamburg (where he served as director in 1958–1960), teaching the same courses he had given in Uppsala and Warsaw. Spending much time in the Reeperbahn red-light district, he entered into a relationship with a transvestite.

== Growing career (1960–1970) ==

===&quot;Madness and Civilization&quot;: 1960===
In West Germany, Foucault completed in 1960 his primary thesis (&quot;thèse principale&quot;) for his State doctorate, titled &quot;Folie et déraison: Histoire de la folie à l&#x27;âge classique&quot; (trans. &quot;Madness and Insanity: History of Madness in the Classical Age&quot;), a philosophical work based upon his studies into the history of medicine. The book discussed how West European society had dealt with madness, arguing that it was a social construct distinct from mental illness. Foucault traces the evolution of the concept of madness through three phases: the Renaissance, the later 17th and 18th centuries, and the modern experience. The work alludes to the work of French poet and playwright Antonin Artaud, who exerted a strong influence over Foucault&#x27;s thought at the time.

&quot;Histoire de la folie&quot; was an expansive work, consisting of 943 pages of text, followed by appendices and a bibliography. Foucault submitted it at the University of Paris, although the university&#x27;s regulations for awarding a State doctorate required the submission of both his main thesis and a shorter complementary thesis. Obtaining a doctorate in France at the period was a multi-step process. The first step was to obtain a &quot;rapporteur&quot;, or &quot;sponsor&quot; for the work: Foucault chose Georges Canguilhem. The second was to find a publisher, and as a result &quot;Folie et déraison&quot; was published in French in May 1961 by the company Plon, whom Foucault chose over Presses Universitaires de France after being rejected by Gallimard. In 1964, a heavily abridged version was published as a mass market paperback, then translated into English for publication the following year as &quot;Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason&quot;.

&quot;Folie et déraison&quot; received a mixed reception in France and in foreign journals focusing on French affairs. Although it was critically acclaimed by Maurice Blanchot, Michel Serres, Roland Barthes, Gaston Bachelard, and Fernand Braudel, it was largely ignored by the leftist press, much to Foucault&#x27;s disappointment. It was notably criticised for advocating metaphysics by young philosopher Jacques Derrida in a March 1963 lecture at the University of Paris. Responding with a vicious retort, Foucault criticised Derrida&#x27;s interpretation of René Descartes. The two remained bitter rivals until reconciling in 1981. In the English-speaking world, the work became a significant influence on the anti-psychiatry movement during the 1960s; Foucault took a mixed approach to this, associating with a number of anti-psychiatrists but arguing that most of them misunderstood his work.

Foucault&#x27;s secondary thesis (), written in Hamburg between 1959 and 1960, was a translation and commentary on German philosopher Immanuel Kant&#x27;s &quot;Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View&quot; (1798); the thesis was titled &quot;Introduction à l&#x27;Anthropologie&quot;. Largely consisting of Foucault&#x27;s discussion of textual dating—an &quot;archaeology of the Kantian text&quot;—he rounded off the thesis with an evocation of Nietzsche, his biggest philosophical influence. This work&#x27;s &quot;rapporteur&quot; was Foucault&#x27;s old tutor and then-director of the ENS, Hyppolite, who was well acquainted with German philosophy. After both theses were championed and reviewed, he underwent his public defense of his doctoral thesis (&quot;soutenance de thèse&quot;) on 20 May 1961. The academics responsible for reviewing his work were concerned about the unconventional nature of his major thesis; reviewer Henri Gouhier noted that it was not a conventional work of history, making sweeping generalisations without sufficient particular argument, and that Foucault clearly &quot;thinks in allegories&quot;. They all agreed however that the overall project was of merit, awarding Foucault his doctorate &quot;despite reservations&quot;.

===University of Clermont-Ferrand, &quot;The Birth of the Clinic&quot;, and &quot;The Order of Things&quot;: 1960–1966===
In October 1960, Foucault took a tenured post in philosophy at the University of Clermont-Ferrand, commuting to the city every week from Paris, where he lived in a high-rise block on the rue du Dr Finlay. Responsible for teaching psychology, which was subsumed within the philosophy department, he was considered a &quot;fascinating&quot; but &quot;rather traditional&quot; teacher at Clermont. The department was run by Jules Vuillemin, who soon developed a friendship with Foucault. Foucault then took Vuillemin&#x27;s job when the latter was elected to the Collège de France in 1962. In this position, Foucault took a dislike to another staff member whom he considered stupid: Roger Garaudy, a senior figure in the Communist Party. Foucault made life at the university difficult for Garaudy, leading the latter to transfer to Poitiers. Foucault also caused controversy by securing a university job for his lover, the philosopher Daniel Defert, with whom he retained a non-monogamous relationship for the rest of his life.

Foucault maintained a keen interest in literature, publishing reviews in literary journals, including &quot;Tel Quel&quot; and &quot;Nouvelle Revue Française&quot;, and sitting on the editorial board of &quot;Critique&quot;, In May 1963, he published a book devoted to poet, novelist, and playwright Raymond Roussel. It was written in under two months, published by Gallimard, and was described by biographer David Macey as &quot;a very personal book&quot; that resulted from a &quot;love affair&quot; with Roussel&#x27;s work. It was published in English in 1983 as &quot;Death and the Labyrinth: The World of Raymond Roussel&quot;. Receiving few reviews, it was largely ignored. That same year he published a sequel to &quot;Folie et déraison&quot;, titled &quot;Naissance de la Clinique&quot;, subsequently translated as &quot;The Birth of the Clinic: An Archaeology of Medical Perception&quot;. Shorter than its predecessor, it focused on the changes that the medical establishment underwent in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Like his preceding work, &quot;Naissance de la Clinique&quot; was largely critically ignored, but later gained a cult following. It was of interest within the field of medical ethics, as it considered the ways in which the history of medicine and hospitals, and the training that those working within them receive, bring about a particular way of looking at the body: the &#x27;medical gaze&#x27;. Foucault was also selected to be among the &quot;Eighteen Man Commission&quot; that assembled between November 1963 and March 1964 to discuss university reforms that were to be implemented by Christian Fouchet, the Gaullist Minister of National Education. Implemented in 1967, they brought staff strikes and student protests.

In April 1966, Gallimard published Foucault&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (Words and Things), later translated as &quot;The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences&quot;. Exploring how man came to be an object of knowledge, it argued that all periods of history have possessed certain underlying conditions of truth that constituted what was acceptable as scientific discourse. Foucault argues that these conditions of discourse have changed over time, from one period&#x27;s &quot;épistémè&quot; to another. Although designed for a specialist audience, the work gained media attention, becoming a surprise bestseller in France. Appearing at the height of interest in structuralism, Foucault was quickly grouped with scholars such as Jacques Lacan, Claude Lévi-Strauss, and Roland Barthes, as the latest wave of thinkers set to topple the existentialism popularized by Jean-Paul Sartre. Although initially accepting this description, Foucault soon vehemently rejected it, because he &quot;never posited a universal theory of discourse, but rather sought to describe the historical forms taken by discoursive practices&quot;. Foucault and Sartre regularly criticised one another in the press. Both Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir attacked Foucault&#x27;s ideas as &quot;bourgeois&quot;, while Foucault retaliated against their Marxist beliefs by proclaiming that &quot;Marxism exists in nineteenth-century thought as a fish exists in water; that is, it ceases to breathe anywhere else.&quot;

===University of Tunis and Vincennes: 1966–1970===
In September 1966, Foucault took a position teaching psychology at the University of Tunis in Tunisia. His decision to do so was largely because his lover, Defert, had been posted to the country as part of his national service. Foucault moved a few kilometres from Tunis, to the village of Sidi Bou Saïd, where fellow academic Gérard Deledalle lived with his wife. Soon after his arrival, Foucault announced that Tunisia was &quot;blessed by history&quot;, a nation which &quot;deserves to live forever because it was where Hannibal and St. Augustine lived&quot;. His lectures at the university proved very popular, and were well attended. Although many young students were enthusiastic about his teaching, they were critical of what they believed to be his right-wing political views, viewing him as a &quot;representative of Gaullist technocracy&quot;, even though he considered himself a leftist.

Foucault was in Tunis during the anti-government and pro-Palestinian riots that rocked the city in June 1967, and which continued for a year. Although highly critical of the violent, ultra-nationalistic and anti-semitic nature of many protesters, he used his status to try to prevent some of his militant leftist students from being arrested and tortured for their role in the agitation. He hid their printing press in his garden, and tried to testify on their behalf at their trials, but was prevented when the trials became closed-door events. While in Tunis, Foucault continued to write. Inspired by a correspondence with the surrealist artist René Magritte, Foucault started to write a book about the impressionist artist Édouard Manet, but never completed it.

In 1968, Foucault returned to Paris, moving into an apartment on the Rue de Vaugirard. After the May 1968 student protests, Minister of Education Edgar Faure responded by founding new universities with greater autonomy. Most prominent of these was the Centre Expérimental de Vincennes in Vincennes on the outskirts of Paris. A group of prominent academics were asked to select teachers to run the centre&#x27;s departments, and Canguilheim recommended Foucault as head of the Philosophy Department. Becoming a tenured professor of Vincennes, Foucault&#x27;s desire was to obtain &quot;the best in French philosophy today&quot; for his department, employing Michel Serres, Judith Miller, Alain Badiou, Jacques Rancière, François Regnault, Henri Weber, Étienne Balibar, and François Châtelet; most of them were Marxists or ultra-left activists.

Lectures began at the university in January 1969, and straight away its students and staff, including Foucault, were involved in occupations and clashes with police, resulting in arrests. In February, Foucault gave a speech denouncing police provocation to protesters at the Maison de la Mutualité. Such actions marked Foucault&#x27;s embrace of the ultra-left, undoubtedly influenced by Defert, who had gained a job at Vincennes&#x27; sociology department and who had become a Maoist. Most of the courses at Foucault&#x27;s philosophy department were Marxist–Leninist oriented, although Foucault himself gave courses on Nietzsche, &quot;The end of Metaphysics&quot;, and &quot;The Discourse of Sexuality&quot;, which were highly popular and over-subscribed. While the right-wing press was heavily critical of this new institution, new Minister of Education Olivier Guichard was angered by its ideological bent and the lack of exams, with students being awarded degrees in a haphazard manner. He refused national accreditation of the department&#x27;s degrees, resulting in a public rebuttal from Foucault.

== Later life (1970–1984) ==

===Collège de France and &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot;: 1970–1975===
Foucault desired to leave Vincennes and become a fellow of the prestigious Collège de France. He requested to join, taking up a chair in what he called the &quot;history of systems of thought&quot;, and his request was championed by members Dumézil, Hyppolite, and Vuillemin. In November 1969, when an opening became available, Foucault was elected to the Collège, though with opposition by a large minority. He gave his inaugural lecture in December 1970, which was subsequently published as &quot;L&#x27;Ordre du discours&quot; (&quot;The Discourse of Language&quot;). He was obliged to give 12 weekly lectures a year—and did so for the rest of his life—covering the topics that he was researching at the time; these became &quot;one of the events of Parisian intellectual life&quot; and were repeatedly packed out events. On Mondays, he also gave seminars to a group of students; many of them became a &quot;Foulcauldian tribe&quot; who worked with him on his research. He enjoyed this teamwork and collective research, and together they published a number of short books. Working at the Collège allowed him to travel widely, giving lectures in Brazil, Japan, Canada, and the United States over the next 14 years. In 1970 and 1972, Foucault served as a professor in the French Department of the University at Buffalo in Buffalo, New York.

In May 1971, Foucault co-founded the Groupe d&#x27;Information sur les Prisons (GIP) along with historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet and journalist Jean-Marie Domenach. The GIP aimed to investigate and expose poor conditions in prisons and give prisoners and ex-prisoners a voice in French society. It was highly critical of the penal system, believing that it converted petty criminals into hardened delinquents. The GIP gave press conferences and staged protests surrounding the events of the Toul prison riot in December 1971, alongside other prison riots that it sparked off; in doing so it faced a police crackdown and repeated arrests. The group became active across France, with 2,000 to 3,000, members, but disbanded before 1974. Also campaigning against the death penalty, Foucault co-authored a short book on the case of the convicted murderer Pierre Rivière. After his research into the penal system, Foucault published &quot;Surveiller et punir: Naissance de la prison&quot; (&quot;Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison&quot;) in 1975, offering a history of the system in western Europe. In it, Foucault examines the penal evolution away from corporal and capital punishment to the penitentiary system that began in Europe and the United States around the end of the 18th century. Biographer Didier Eribon described it as &quot;perhaps the finest&quot; of Foucault&#x27;s works, and it was well received.

Foucault was also active in anti-racist campaigns; in November 1971, he was a leading figure in protests following the perceived racist killing of Arab migrant Djellali Ben Ali. In this he worked alongside his old rival Sartre, the journalist Claude Mauriac, and one of his literary heroes, Jean Genet. This campaign was formalised as the Committee for the Defence of the Rights of Immigrants, but there was tension at their meetings as Foucault opposed the anti-Israeli sentiment of many Arab workers and Maoist activists. At a December 1972 protest against the police killing of Algerian worker Mohammad Diab, both Foucault and Genet were arrested, resulting in widespread publicity. Foucault was also involved in founding the Agence de Press-Libération (APL), a group of leftist journalists who intended to cover news stories neglected by the mainstream press. In 1973, they established the daily newspaper &quot;Libération&quot;, and Foucault suggested that they establish committees across France to collect news and distribute the paper, and advocated a column known as the &quot;Chronicle of the Workers&#x27; Memory&quot; to allow workers to express their opinions. Foucault wanted an active journalistic role in the paper, but this proved untenable, and he soon became disillusioned with &quot;Libération&quot;, believing that it distorted the facts; he did not publish in it until 1980. 

In 1975 he had an LSD experience with Simeon Wade and Michael Stoneman in Death Valley, California, and later wrote &quot;it was the greatest experience of his life, and that it profoundly changed his life and his work&quot;. In front of Zabriskie Point they took LSD while listening to a well-prepared music program: Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Four Last Songs&quot;, followed by Charles Ives&#x27;s &quot;Three Places in New England&quot;, ending with a few avant-garde pieces by Stockhausen. According to Wade, as soon as he came back to Paris, Foucault scrapped the second &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot;″s manuscript, and totally rethought the whole project.

===&quot;The History of Sexuality&quot; and Iranian Revolution: 1976–1979===
In 1976, Gallimard published Foucault&#x27;s &quot;Histoire de la sexualité: la volonté de savoir&quot; (&quot;The History of Sexuality: The Will to Knowledge&quot;), a short book exploring what Foucault called the &quot;repressive hypothesis&quot;. It revolved largely around the concept of power, rejecting both Marxist and Freudian theory. Foucault intended it as the first in a seven-volume exploration of the subject. &quot;Histoire de la sexualité&quot; was a best-seller in France and gained positive press, but lukewarm intellectual interest, something that upset Foucault, who felt that many misunderstood his hypothesis. He soon became dissatisfied with Gallimard after being offended by senior staff member Pierre Nora. Along with Paul Veyne and François Wahl, Foucault launched a new series of academic books, known as &quot;Des travaux&quot; (&quot;Some Works&quot;), through the company Seuil, which he hoped would improve the state of academic research in France. He also produced introductions for the memoirs of Herculine Barbin and &quot;My Secret Life&quot;.

Foucault&#x27;s &quot;Histoire de la sexualité&quot; concentrates on the relation between truth and sex. He defines truth as a system of ordered procedures for the production, distribution, regulation, circulation, and operation of statements. Through this system of truth, power structures are created and enforced. Though Foucault&#x27;s definition of truth may differ from other sociologists before and after him, his work with truth in relation to power structures, such as sexuality, has left a profound mark on social science theory. In his work, he examines the heightened curiosity regarding sexuality that induced a &quot;world of perversion&quot; during the elite, capitalist 18th and 19th century in the western world. According to Foucault in &quot;History of Sexuality&quot;, society of the modern age is symbolized by the conception of sexual discourses and their union with the system of truth. In the &quot;world of perversion&quot;, including extramarital affairs, homosexual behavior, and other such sexual promiscuities, Foucault concludes that sexual relations of the kind are constructed around producing the truth. Sex became not only a means of pleasure, but an issue of truth. Sex is what confines one to darkness, but also what brings one to light.

Similarly, in &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot;, society validates and approves people based on how closely they fit the discursive mold of sexual truth. As Foucault reminds us, in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Church was the epitome of power structure within society. Thus, many aligned their personal virtues with those of the Church, further internalizing their beliefs on the meaning of sex. However, those who unify their sexual relation to the truth become decreasingly obliged to share their internal views with those of the Church. They will no longer see the arrangement of societal norms as an effect of the Church&#x27;s deep-seated power structure.

Foucault remained a political activist, focusing on protesting government abuses of human rights around the world. He was a key player in the 1975 protests against the Spanish government who were set to execute 11 militants sentenced to death without fair trial. It was his idea to travel to Madrid with six others to give a press conference there; they were subsequently arrested and deported back to Paris. In 1977, he protested the extradition of Klaus Croissant to West Germany, and his rib was fractured during clashes with riot police. In July that year, he organised an assembly of Eastern Bloc dissidents to mark the visit of Soviet general secretary Leonid Brezhnev to Paris. In 1979, he campaigned for Vietnamese political dissidents to be granted asylum in France.

In 1977, Italian newspaper &quot;Corriere della sera&quot; asked Foucault to write a column for them. In doing so, in 1978 he travelled to Tehran in Iran, days after the Black Friday massacre. Documenting the developing Iranian Revolution, he met with opposition leaders such as Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari and Mehdi Bazargan, and discovered the popular support for Islamism. Returning to France, he was one of the journalists who visited the Ayatollah Khomeini, before visiting Tehran. His articles expressed awe of Khomeini&#x27;s Islamist movement, for which he was widely criticised in the French press, including by Iranian expatriates. Foucault&#x27;s response was that Islamism was to become a major political force in the region, and that the West must treat it with respect rather than hostility. In April 1978, Foucault traveled to Japan, where he studied Zen Buddhism under Omori Sogen at the Seionji temple in Uenohara.

===Final years: 1980–1984===
Although remaining critical of power relations, Foucault expressed cautious support for the Socialist Party government of François Mitterrand following its electoral victory in 1981. But his support soon deteriorated when that party refused to condemn the Polish government&#x27;s crackdown on the 1982 demonstrations in Poland orchestrated by the Solidarity trade union. He and sociologist Pierre Bourdieu authored a document condemning Mitterrand&#x27;s inaction that was published in &quot;Libération&quot;, and they also took part in large public protests on the issue. Foucault continued to support Solidarity, and with his friend Simone Signoret traveled to Poland as part of a Médecins du Monde expedition, taking time out to visit the Auschwitz concentration camp. He continued his academic research, and in June 1984 Gallimard published the second and third volumes of &quot;Histoire de la sexualité&quot;. Volume two, &quot;L&#x27;Usage des plaisirs&quot;, dealt with the &quot;techniques of self&quot; prescribed by ancient Greek pagan morality in relation to sexual ethics, while volume three, &quot;Le Souci de soi&quot;, explored the same theme in the Greek and Latin texts of the first two centuries CE. A fourth volume, &quot;Les Aveux de la chair&quot;, was to examine sexuality in early Christianity, but it was not finished.

In October 1980, Foucault became a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley, giving the Howison Lectures on &quot;Truth and Subjectivity&quot;, while in November he lectured at the Humanities Institute at New York University. His growing popularity in American intellectual circles was noted by &quot;Time&quot; magazine, while Foucault went on to lecture at University of California, Los Angeles in 1981, the University of Vermont in 1982, and Berkeley again in 1983, where his lectures drew huge crowds. Foucault spent many evenings in the San Francisco gay scene, frequenting sado-masochistic bathhouses, engaging in unprotected sex. He praised sado-masochistic activity in interviews with the gay press, describing it as &quot;the real creation of new possibilities of pleasure, which people had no idea about previously&quot;. Foucault contracted HIV and eventually developed AIDS. Little was known of the virus at the time; the first cases had only been identified in 1980. Foucault initially referred to AIDS as a &quot;dreamed-up disease&quot;. In summer 1983, he developed a persistent dry cough, which concerned friends in Paris, but Foucault insisted it was just a pulmonary infection. Only when hospitalized was Foucault correctly diagnosed as being HIV-positive; treated with antibiotics, he delivered a final set of lectures at the Collège de France. Foucault entered Paris&#x27; Hôpital de la Salpêtrière—the same institution that he had studied in &quot;Madness and Civilisation&quot;—on 10 June 1984, with neurological symptoms complicated by sepsis. He died in the hospital on 25 June.

== Death ==
On 26 June 1984, &quot;Libération&quot; announced Foucault&#x27;s death, mentioning the rumour that it had been brought on by AIDS. The following day, &quot;Le Monde&quot; issued a medical bulletin cleared by his family that made no reference to HIV/AIDS. On 29 June, Foucault&#x27;s &quot;la levée du corps&quot; ceremony was held, in which the coffin was carried from the hospital morgue. Hundreds attended, including activists and academic friends, while Gilles Deleuze gave a speech using excerpts from &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot;. His body was then buried at Vendeuvre-du-Poitou in a small ceremony. Soon after his death, Foucault&#x27;s partner Daniel Defert founded the first national HIV/AIDS organisation in France, AIDES; a play on the French word for &quot;help&quot; (&quot;aide&quot;) and the English- language acronym for the disease. On the second anniversary of Foucault&#x27;s death, Defert publicly revealed in &quot;The Advocate&quot; that Foucault&#x27;s death was AIDS-related.

==Personal life==
Foucault&#x27;s first biographer, Didier Eribon, described the philosopher as &quot;a complex, many-sided character&quot;, and that &quot;under one mask there is always another&quot;. He also noted that he exhibited an &quot;enormous capacity for work&quot;. At the ENS, Foucault&#x27;s classmates unanimously summed him up as a figure who was both &quot;disconcerting and strange&quot; and &quot;a passionate worker&quot;. As he aged, his personality changed: Eribon noted that while he was a &quot;tortured adolescent&quot;, post-1960, he had become &quot;a radiant man, relaxed and cheerful&quot;, even being described by those who worked with him as a dandy. He noted that in 1969, Foucault embodied the idea of &quot;the militant intellectual&quot;.

Foucault was an atheist. He loved classical music, particularly enjoying the work of Johann Sebastian Bach and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and became known for wearing turtleneck sweaters. After his death, Foucault&#x27;s friend Georges Dumézil described him as having possessed &quot;a profound kindness and goodness&quot;, also exhibiting an &quot;intelligence [that] literally knew no bounds&quot;. His life-partner Daniel Defert inherited his estate, whose archive was sold in 2012 to the National Library of France for €3.8 million ($4.5 million in April 2021).

===Politics===
Politically, Foucault was a leftist throughout much of his life, though his particular stance within the left often changed. In the early 1950s, while never adopting an orthodox Marxist viewpoint, Foucault had been a member of the French Communist Party, leaving the party after three years as he expressed disgust in the prejudice within its ranks against Jews and homosexuals. After spending some time working in Poland, which was a Communist state ostensibly governed by the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party but actually was an abject police-state satellite of the Soviet Union, he became further disillusioned with communist ideology. As a result, in the early 1960s, Foucault was considered to be &quot;violently anticommunist&quot; by some of his detractors, even though he was involved in leftist campaigns along with most of his students and colleagues.

==Philosophical work==

Foucault&#x27;s colleague Pierre Bourdieu summarized the philosopher&#x27;s thought as &quot;a long exploration of transgression, of going beyond social limits, always inseparably linked to knowledge and power&quot;.

Philosopher Philip Stokes of the University of Reading noted that overall, Foucault&#x27;s work was &quot;dark and pessimistic&quot;. Though it does, however, leave some room for optimism, in that it illustrates how the discipline of philosophy can be used to highlight areas of domination. In doing so, as Stokes claimed, the ways in which we are being dominated become better understood, so that we may strive to build social structures that minimise this risk of domination. In all of this development there had to be close attention to detail; it is the detail which eventually individualizes people.

Later in his life, Foucault explained that his work was less about analyzing power as a phenomenon than about trying to characterize the different ways in which contemporary society has expressed the use of power to &quot;objectivise subjects&quot;. These have taken three broad forms: one involving scientific authority to classify and &#x27;order&#x27; knowledge about human populations; the second has been to categorize and &#x27;normalise&#x27; human subjects (by identifying madness, illness, physical features, and so on); and the third relates to the manner in which the impulse to fashion sexual identities and train one&#x27;s own body to engage in routines and practices ends up reproducing certain patterns within a given society.

===Literature===
In addition to his philosophical work, Foucault also wrote on literature. &quot;Death and the Labyrinth: The World of Raymond Roussel&quot;, published in 1963 and translated in English in 1986, is Foucault&#x27;s only book-length work on literature. He described it as &quot;by far the book I wrote most easily, with the greatest pleasure, and most rapidly&quot;. Foucault explores theory, criticism, and psychology with reference to the texts of Raymond Roussel, one of the first notable experimental writers. Foucault also gave a lecture responding to Roland Barthes&#x27; famous essay &quot;The Death of the Author&quot; titled &quot;What Is an Author?&quot; in 1969, later published in full. According to literary theoretician Kornelije Kvas, for Foucault, &quot;denying the existence of a historical author on account of his/her irrelevance for interpretation is absurd, for the author is a function of the text that organizes its sense&quot;.

=== Power ===
Foucault&#x27;s analysis of power comes in two forms: empirical and theoretical. The empirical analyses concern themselves with historical (and modern) forms of power and how these emerged from previous forms of power. Foucault describes three types of power in his empirical analyses: &quot;sovereign&quot; power, &quot;disciplinary&quot; power, and &quot;biopower&quot;.

Foucault is generally critical of &quot;theories&quot; that try to give absolute answers to &quot;everything&quot;. Therefore, he considered his own &quot;theory&quot; of power to be closer to a method than a typical &quot;theory&quot;. According to Foucault, most people misunderstand power. For this reason, he makes clear that power cannot be completely described as:
* A group of institutions and/or mechanisms whose aim it is for a citizen to obey and yield to the state (a typical liberal definition of power);
* Yielding to rules (a typical psychoanalytical definition of power); or
* A general and oppressing system where one societal class or group oppresses another (a typical feminist or Orthodox Marxist definition of power).

Foucault is not critical of considering these phenomena as &quot;power&quot;, but claims that these theories of power cannot completely describe &quot;all&quot; forms of power. Foucault also claims that a liberal definition of power has effectively hidden other forms of power to the extent that people have uncritically accepted them.

Foucault&#x27;s power analysis begins on micro-level, with singular &quot;force relations&quot;. Richard A. Lynch defines Foucault&#x27;s concept of &quot;force relation&quot; as &quot;whatever in one&#x27;s social interactions that pushes, urges or compels one to do something&quot;. According to Foucault, force relations are an effect of difference, inequality or unbalance that exists in other forms of relationships (such as sexual or economic). Force, and power, is however not something that a person or group &quot;holds&quot; (such as in the sovereign definition of power), instead power is a complex group of forces that comes from &quot;everything&quot; and therefore exists everywhere. That relations of power always result from inequality, difference or unbalance also means that power always has a goal or purpose. Power comes in two forms: tactics and strategies. Tactics is power on the micro-level, which can for example be how a person chooses to express themselves through their clothes. Strategies on the other hand, is power on macro-level, which can be the state of fashion at any moment. Strategies consist of a combination of tactics. At the same time, power is non-subjective according to Foucault. This posits a paradox, according to Lynch, since &quot;someone&quot; has to exert power, while at the same time there can be no &quot;someone&quot; exerting this power. According to Lynch this paradox can be solved with two observations:
* By looking at power as something which reaches further than the influence of single people or groups. Even if individuals and groups try to influence fashion, for example, their actions will often get unexpected consequences.
* Even if individuals and groups have a free choice, they are also affected and limited by their context/situation.

According to Foucault, force relations are constantly changing, constantly interacting with other force relations which may weaken, strengthen or change one another. Foucault writes that power always includes resistance, which means there is always a possibility that power and force relations will change in some way. According to Richard A. Lynch, the purpose of Foucault&#x27;s work on power is to increase peoples&#x27; awareness of how power has shaped their way of being, thinking and acting, and by increasing this awareness making it possible for them to change their way of being, thinking and acting.

==== Sovereign power ====
With &quot;sovereign power&quot; Foucault alludes to a power structure that is similar to a pyramid, where one person or a group of people (at the top of the pyramid) holds the power, while the &quot;normal&quot; (and oppressed) people are at the bottom of the pyramid. In the middle parts of the pyramid are the people who enforce the sovereign&#x27;s orders. A typical example of sovereign power is absolute monarchy.

In historical absolute monarchies, crimes had been considered a personal offense against the sovereign and his/her power. The punishment was often public and spectacular, partly to deter others from committing crimes, but also to reinstate the sovereign&#x27;s power. This was however both expensive and ineffective—it led far too often to people sympathizing with the criminal. In modern times, when disciplinary power is dominant, criminals are instead subjected to various disciplinary techniques to &quot;remold&quot; the criminal into a &quot;law abiding citizen&quot;.

According to Chloë Taylor, a characteristic for sovereign power is that the sovereign has the right to take life, wealth, services, labor and products. The sovereign has a right to subtract—to take life, to enslave life, etc.—but not the right to control life in the way that later happens in disciplinary systems of power. According to Taylor, the form of power that the philosopher Thomas Hobbes is concerned about, is sovereign power. According to Hobbes, people are &quot;free&quot; so long they are not literally placed in chains.

==== Disciplinary power ====

What Foucault calls &quot;disciplinary power&quot; aims to use bodies&#x27; skills as effectively as possible. The more useful the body becomes, the more obedient it also has to become. The purpose of this is not only to use the bodies&#x27; skills, but also prevent these skills from being used to revolt against the power.

Disciplinary power has &quot;individuals&quot; as its object, target and instrument. According to Foucault, &quot;individual&quot; is however a construct created by disciplinary power. The disciplinary power&#x27;s techniques create a &quot;rational self-control&quot;, which in practice means that the disciplinary power is internalized and therefore doesn&#x27;t continuously need external force. Foucault says that disciplinary power is primarily not an oppressing form of power, but rather so a productive form of power. Disciplinary power doesn&#x27;t oppress interests or desires, but instead subjects bodies to reconstructed patterns of behavior to reconstruct their thoughts, desires and interests. According to Foucault this happens in factories, schools, hospitals and prisons. Disciplinary power creates a certain type of individual by producing new movements, habits and skills. It focuses on details, single movements, their timing and speed. It organizes bodies in time and space, and controls every movement for maximal effect. It uses rules, surveillance, exams and controls. The activities follow certain plans, whose purpose it is to lead the bodies to certain pre-determined goals. The bodies are also combined with each other, to reach a productivity that is greater than the sum of all bodies activities.

Disciplinary power has according to Foucault been especially successful due to its usage of three technologies: hierarchical observation, normalizing judgement and exams. By hierarchical observation, the bodies become constantly visible to the power. The observation is hierarchical since there is not a single observer, but rather so a &quot;hierarchy&quot; of observers. An example of this is mental asylums during the 19th century, when the psychiatrist was not the only observer, but also nurses and auxiliary staff. From these observations and scientific discourses, a norm is established and used to judge the observed bodies. For the disciplinary power to continue to exist, this judgement has to be normalized. Foucault mentions several characteristics of this judgement: (1) all deviations, even small ones, from correct behavior are punished, (2) repeated rule violations are punished extra, (3) exercises are used as a behavior correcting technique and punishment, (4) rewards are used together with punishment to establish a hierarchy of good and bad behavior/people, (5) rank/grades/etc. are used as punishment and reward. Examinations combine the hierarchical observation with judgement. Exams objectify and individualize the observed bodies by creating extensive documentation about every observed body. The purpose of the exams is therefore to gather further information about each individual, track their development and compare their results to the norm.

According to Foucault, the &quot;formula&quot; for disciplinary power can be seen in philosopher Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s plan for the &quot;optimal prison&quot;: the panopticon. Such a prison consists of a circle-formed building where every cell is inhabited by only one prisoner. In every cell there are two windows—one to let in light from outside and one pointing to the middle of the circle-formed building. In this middle there is a tower where a guard can be placed to observe the prisoners. Since the prisoners will never be able to know whether they are being watched or not at a given moment, they will internalize the disciplinary power and regulate their own behavior (&quot;as if&quot; they were constantly being watched). Foucault says this construction (1) creates an individuality by separating prisoners from each other in the physical room, (2) since the prisoners cannot know if they are being watched at any given moment, they internalize the disciplinary power and regulate their own behavior as if they were always watched, (3) the surveillance makes it possible to create extensive documentation about each prisoner and their behavior. According to Foucault the panopticon has been used as a model also for other disciplinary institutions, such as mental asylums in the 19th century.

==== Biopower ====

With &quot;biopower&quot; Foucault refers to power over &quot;bios&quot; (life)—power over populations. Biopower primarily rests on norms which are internalized by people, rather than external force. It encourages, strengthens, controls, observes, optimizes and organize the forces below it. Foucault has sometimes described biopower as separate from disciplinary power, but at other times he has described disciplinary power as an expression of biopower. Biopower can use disciplinary techniques, but in contrast to disciplinary power its target is populations rather than individuals.

Biopower studies populations regarding (for example) number of births, life expectancy, public health, housing, migration, crime, which social groups are over-represented in deviations from the norm (regarding health, crime, etc.) and tries to adjust, control or eliminate these norm deviations. One example is the age distribution in a population. Biopower is interested in age distribution to compensate for future (or current) lacks of labor power, retirement homes, etc. Yet another example is sex: because sex is connected to population growth, sex and sexuality have been of great interest to biopower. On a disciplinary level, people who engaged in non-reproductive sexual acts have been treated for psychiatric diagnoses such as &quot;perversion&quot;, &quot;frigidity&quot; and &quot;sexual dysfunction&quot;. On a biopower-level, the usage of contraceptives has been studied, some social groups have (by various means) been encouraged to have children, while others (such as poor, sick, unmarried women, criminals or people with disabilities) have been discouraged or prevented from having children.

In the era of biopower, death has become a scandal and a catastrophe, but despite this biopower has according to Foucault killed more people than any other form of power has ever done before it. Under sovereign power, the sovereign king could kill people to exert his power or start wars simply to extend his kingdom, but during the era of biopower wars have instead been motivated by an ambition to &quot;protect life itself&quot;. Similar motivations has also been used for genocide. For example, Nazi Germany motivated its attempt to eradicate Jews, the mentally ill and disabled with the motivation that Jews were &quot;a threat to the German health&quot;, and that the money spent on healthcare for mentally ill and disabled people would be better spent on &quot;viable Germans&quot;. Chloë Taylor also mentions the Iraq War was motivated by similar tenets. The motivation was at first that Iraq was thought to have weapons of mass destruction and connections to Al-Qaeda. However, when the Bush and Blair administrations did not find any evidence to support either of these theories, the motivation for the war was changed. In the new motivation, the cause of the war was said to be that Saddam Hussein had committed crimes against his own population. Taylor means that in modern times, war has to be &quot;concealed&quot; under a rhetoric of humanitarian aid, despite the fact that these wars often cause humanitarian crises.

During the 19th century, slums were increasing in number and size across the western world. Criminality, illness, alcoholism and prostitution was common in these areas, and the middle class considered the people who lived in these slums as &quot;unmoral&quot; and &quot;lazy&quot;. The middle class also feared that this underclass sooner or later would &quot;take over&quot; because the population growth was greater in these slums than it was in the middle class. This fear gave rise to the scientific study of eugenics, whose founder Francis Galton had been inspired by Charles Darwin and his theory of natural selection. According to Galton, society was preventing natural selection by helping &quot;the weak&quot;, thus causing a spread of the &quot;negative qualities&quot; into the rest of the population.

=== The body and sexuality ===
According to Foucault, the body is not something objective that stands outside history and culture. Instead, Foucault argues, the body has been and is continuously shaped by society and history—by work, diet, body ideals, exercise, medical interventions, etc. Foucault presents no &quot;theory&quot; of the body, but does write about it in &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot; as well as in &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot;. Foucault was critical of all purely biological explanations of phenomena such as sexuality, madness and criminality. Further, Foucault argues, that the body is not sufficient as a basis for self-understanding and understanding of others.

In &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot;, Foucault shows how power and the body are tied together, for example by the disciplinary power primarily focusing on individual bodies and their behavior. Foucault argues that power, by manipulating bodies/behavior, also manipulates people&#x27;s minds. Foucault turns the platonic saying &quot;the body is the prison of the soul&quot; (&quot;Phaedo&quot;, 66a–67d) and instead posits that &quot;the soul is the prison of the body&quot;.

According to Foucault, sexology has tried to exert itself as a &quot;science&quot; by referring to the material (the body). In contrast to this, Foucault argues that sexology is a pseudoscience, and that &quot;sex&quot; is a pseudo-scientific idea. For Foucault the idea of a natural, biologically grounded and fundamental sexuality is a normative historical construct that has also been used as an instrument of power. By describing sex as the biological and fundamental cause to peoples&#x27; gender identity, sexual identity and sexual behavior, power has effectively been able to normalize sexual and gendered behavior. This has made it possible to evaluate, pathologize and &quot;correct&quot; peoples&#x27; sexual and gendered behavior, by comparing bodies behaviors to the constructed &quot;normal&quot; behavior. For Foucault, a &quot;normal sexuality&quot; is as much of a construct as a &quot;natural sexuality&quot;. Therefore, Foucault was also critical of the popular discourse that dominated the debate over sexuality during the 1960s and 1970s. During this time, the popular discourse argued for a &quot;liberation&quot; of sexuality from a cultural, moral and capitalistic oppression. Foucault, however, argues that peoples&#x27; opinions about and experiences of sexuality are &quot;always&quot; a result of cultural and power mechanisms. To &quot;liberate&quot; sexuality from one group of norms only means that another group of norms takes its place. This, however, does not mean that Foucault considers resistance to be futile. What Foucault argues for is rather that it is impossible to become completely free from power, and that there is simply no &quot;natural&quot; sexuality. Power always involves a dimension of resistance, and therefore also a possibility for change. Although Foucault considers it impossible to step outside of power-networks, it is always possible to change these networks or navigate them differently.

According to Foucault, the body is not only an &quot;obedient and passive object&quot; that is dominated by discourses and power. The body is also the &quot;seed&quot; to resistance against dominant discourses and power techniques. The body is never fully compliant, and experiences can never fully be reduced to linguistic descriptions. There is always a possibility to experience something that is not possible to describe with words, and in this discrepancy there is also a possibility for resistance against dominant discourses.

Foucault&#x27;s view of the historical construction of the body has influenced many feminist and queer-theorists. According to Johanna Oksala, Foucault&#x27;s influence on queer theory has been so great than he can be considered one of the founders of queer theory. The fundamental idea behind queer theory is that there is no natural fundament that lies behind identities such as gay, lesbian, heterosexual, etc. Instead these identities are considered cultural constructions that have been constructed through normative discourses and relations of power. Feminists have with the help of Foucault&#x27;s ideas studied different ways that women form their bodies: through plastic surgery, diet, eating disorders, etc. Foucault&#x27;s historization of sex has also affected feminist theorists such as Judith Butler, who used Foucault&#x27;s theories about the relation between subject, power and sex to question gendered subjects. Butler follows Foucault by saying that there is no &quot;true&quot; gender behind gender identity that constitutes its biological and objective fundament. However, Butler is critical of Foucault, arguing that Foucault &quot;naively&quot; presents bodies and pleasures as a ground for resistance against power without extending his historization of sexuality to gendered subjects/bodies. Foucault has received criticism from other feminists, such as Susan Bordo and Kate Soper.

Johanna Oksala argues that Foucault, by saying that sex/sexuality are constructed, doesn&#x27;t deny the existence of sexuality. Oksala also argues that the goal of critical theories such as Foucault&#x27;s is not to liberate the body and sexuality from oppression, but rather to question and deny the identities that are posited as &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;essential&quot; by showing how these identities are historical and cultural constructions.

In May 1977, Foucault signed a petition to the French parliament, calling for the lowering of the homosexual age of consent from 21 to 15 to match with the heterosexual one. In a 1978 broadcast, Foucault argued that children could give sexual consent, saying that &quot;to assume that a child is incapable of explaining what happened and was incapable of giving his consent are two abuses that are intolerable, quite unacceptable.&quot;

=== Subjectivity ===
Foucault considered his primary project to be the investigation of how people through history have been made into &quot;subjects&quot;. Subjectivity, for Foucault, is not a state of being, but a practice—an active &quot;being&quot;. According to Foucault, &quot;the subject&quot; has, by western philosophers, usually been considered as something given; natural and objective. On the contrary, Foucault considers subjectivity to be a construction created by power. Foucault talks of &quot;assujettissement&quot;, which is a French term that for Foucault refers to a process where power creates subjects while also oppressing them using social norms. For Foucault &quot;social norms&quot; are standards that people are encouraged to follow, that are also used to compare and define people. As an example of &quot;assujettissement&quot;, Foucault mentions &quot;homosexual&quot;, a historically contingent type of subjectivity that was created by sexology. Foucault writes that sodomy was previously considered a serious sexual deviation, but a temporary one. Homosexuality, however, became a &quot;species&quot;, a past, a childhood and a type of life. &quot;Homosexuals&quot; have by the same power that created this subjectivity been discriminated against, due to homosexuality being considered as a deviation from the &quot;normal&quot; sexuality. However, Foucault argues, the creation of a subjectivity such as &quot;homosexuality&quot; does not only have negative consequences for the people who are subjectivised—subjectivity of homosexuality has also led to the creation of gay bars and the pride parade.

According to Foucault, scientific discourses have played an important role in the disciplinary power system, by classifying and categorizing people, observing their behavior and &quot;treating&quot; them when their behavior has been considered &quot;abnormal&quot;. He defines discourse as a form of oppression that does not require physical force. He identifies its production as &quot;controlled, selected, organized and redistributed by a certain number of procedures&quot;, which are driven by individuals&#x27; aspiration of knowledge to create &quot;rules&quot; and &quot;systems&quot; that translate into social codes. Moreover, discourse creates a force that extends beyond societal institutions and could be found in social and formal fields such as health care systems, education and law enforcement. The formation of these fields may seem to contribute to social development; however, Foucault warns against discourses&#x27; harmful aspects on society.

Sciences such as psychiatry, biology, medicine, economics, psychoanalysis, psychology, sociology, ethnology, pedagogy and criminology have all categorized behaviors as rational, irrational, normal, abnormal, human, inhuman, etc. By doing so, they have all created various types of subjectivity and norms, which are then internalized by people as &quot;truths&quot;. People have then adapted their behavior to get closer to what these sciences has labeled as &quot;normal&quot;. For example, Foucault claims that psychological observation/surveillance and psychological discourses have created a type of psychology-centered subjectivity, which has led to people considering unhappiness a fault in their psychology rather than in society. This has also, according to Foucault, been a way for society to resist criticism—criticism against society has been turned against the individual and their psychological health.

==== Self-constituting subjectivity ====
According to Foucault, subjectivity is not necessarily something that is forced upon people externally—it is also something that is established in a person&#x27;s relation to themselves. This can, for example, happen when a person is trying to &quot;find themselves&quot; or &quot;be themselves&quot;, something Edward McGushin describes as a typical modern activity. In this quest for the &quot;true self&quot;, the self is established in two levels: as a passive object (the &quot;true self&quot; that is searched for) and as an active &quot;searcher&quot;. The ancient Cynics and the 19th-century philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche posited that the &quot;true self&quot; can only be found by going through great hardship and/or danger. The ancient Stoics and 17th-century philosopher René Descartes, however, argued that the &quot;self&quot; can be found by quiet and solitary introspection. Yet another example is Socrates, who argued that self-awareness can only be found by having debates with others, where the debaters question each other&#x27;s foundational views and opinions. Foucault, however, argued that &quot;subjectivity&quot; is a process, rather than a state of being. As such, Foucault argued that there is no &quot;true self&quot; to be found. Rather so, the &quot;self&quot; is constituted/created in activities such as the ones employed to &quot;find&quot; the &quot;self&quot;. In other words, exposing oneself to hardships and danger does not &quot;reveal&quot; the &quot;true self&quot;, according to Foucault, but rather creates a particular type of self and subjectivity. However, according to Foucault the &quot;form&quot; for the subject is in great part already constituted by power, before these self-constituting practices are employed. Schools, workplaces, households, government institutions, entertainment media and the healthcare sector all, through disciplinary power, contribute to forming people into being particular types of subjects.

=== Freedom ===
Todd May defines Foucault&#x27;s concept of freedom as: that which we can do of ourselves within our specific historical context. A condition for this, according to Foucault, is that we are aware of our situation and how it has been created/affected (and is still being affected) by power. According to May, two of the aspects of how power has shaped peoples&#x27; way of being, thinking and acting are described in the books where Foucault deals with disciplinary power and the history of sexuality. However, May argues, there will always be aspects of peoples&#x27; formation that will be unknown to them, hence the constant necessity for the type of analyses that Foucault did.

Foucault argues that the forces that have affected people can be changed; people always have the capacity to change the factors that limit their freedom. Freedom is thus not a state of being, but a practice—a way of being in relation to oneself, to others and to the world. According to Todd May, Foucault&#x27;s concept of freedom also includes constructing histories like the ones Foucault did about the history of disciplinary power and sexuality—histories that investigate and describe the forces that have influenced people into becoming who they are. From the knowledge that is reached through such investigations, people can thereafter decide which forces they believe are acceptable and which they consider to be intolerable and has to be changed. Freedom is for Foucault a type of &quot;experimentation&quot; with different &quot;transformations&quot;. Since these experiments cannot be controlled completely, May argues they may either lead to the reconstruction of intolerable power relations or the creation of new ones. Thus, May argues, it is always necessary to continue with such experimentation and Foucauldian analyses.

==== Practice of critique ====
Foucault&#x27;s &quot;alternative&quot; to the modern subjectivity is described by Cressida Heyes as &quot;critique&quot;. For Foucault there are no &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; forms of subjectivity, since they are all a result of power relations. In the same way, Foucault argues there are no &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; norms. All norms and institutions are at the same time enabling as they are oppressing. Therefore, Foucault argues, it is always crucial to continue with the practice of &quot;critique&quot;. Critique is for Foucault a practice that searches for the processes and events that led to our way of being—a questioning of who we &quot;are&quot; and how this &quot;we&quot; came to be. Such a &quot;critical ontology of the present&quot; shows that peoples&#x27; current &quot;being&quot; is in fact a historically contingent, unstable and changeable construction. Foucault emphasizes that since the current way of being is not a necessity, it is also possible to change it. Critique also includes investigating how and when people are being enabled and when they are being oppressed by the current norms and institutions, finding ways to reduce limitations on freedom, resist normalization and develop new and different way of relating to oneself and others. Foucault argues that it is impossible to go beyond power relations, but that it is always possible to navigate power relations in a different way.

====&quot;Epimeleia heautou&quot;, &quot;care for the self&quot;====
As an alternative to the modern &quot;search&quot; for the &quot;true self&quot;, and as a part of &quot;the work of freedom&quot;, Foucault discusses the antique Greek term epimeleia heautou, &quot;care for the self&quot; (ἐπιμέλεια ἑαυτοῦ). According to Foucault, among the ancient Greek philosophers, self-awareness was not a goal in itself, but rather something that was sought after in order to &quot;care for oneself&quot;. Care for the self consists of what Foucault calls &quot;the art of living&quot; or &quot;technologies of the self&quot;. The goal of these techniques was, according to Foucault, to transform oneself into a more ethical person. As an example of this, Foucault mentions meditation, the stoic activity of contemplating past and future actions and evaluating if these actions are in line with one&#x27;s values and goals, and &quot;contemplation of nature&quot;. Contemplation of nature is another stoic activity, that consists of reflecting on how &quot;small&quot; one&#x27;s existence is when compared to the greater cosmos.

=== Knowledge ===

Foucault is described by Mary Beth Mader as an epistemological constructivist and historicist. Foucault is critical of the idea that humans can reach &quot;absolute&quot; knowledge about the world. A fundamental goal in many of Foucault&#x27;s works is to show how that which has traditionally been considered as absolute, universal and true in fact are historically contingent. To Foucault, even the idea of absolute knowledge is a historically contingent idea. This does however not lead to epistemological nihilism; rather, Foucault argues that we &quot;always begin anew&quot; when it comes to knowledge. At the same time Foucault is critical of modern western philosophy for lacking &quot;spirituality&quot;. With &quot;spirituality&quot; Foucault refers to a certain type of ethical being, and the processes that lead to this state of being. Foucault argues that such a spirituality was a natural part of the ancient Greek philosophy, where knowledge was considered as something that was only accessible to those that had an ethical character. According to Foucault this changed in the &quot;cartesian moment&quot;, the moment when René Descartes reached the &quot;insight&quot; that self-awareness was something given (Cogito, ergo sum, &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;), and from this &quot;insight&quot; Descartes drew conclusions about God, the world, and knowledge. According to Foucault, since Descartes knowledge has been something separate from ethics. In modern times, Foucault argues, anyone can reach &quot;knowledge&quot;, as long as they are rational beings, educated, willing to participate in the scientific community and use a scientific method. Foucault is critical of this &quot;modern&quot; view of knowledge.

Foucault describes two types of &quot;knowledge&quot;: &quot;savoir&quot; and &quot;connaissance&quot;, two French terms that both can be translated as &quot;knowledge&quot; but with separate meanings for Foucault. By &quot;savoir&quot; Foucault is referring to a process where subjects are created, while at the same time these subjects also become objects for knowledge. An example of this can be seen in criminology and psychiatry. In these sciences, subjects such as &quot;the rational person&quot;, &quot;the mentally ill person&quot;, &quot;the law abiding person&quot;, &quot;the criminal&quot;, etc. are created, and these sciences center their attention and knowledge on these subjects. The knowledge about these subjects is &quot;connaissance&quot;, while the process in which subjects and knowledge are created is &quot;savoir&quot;. A similar term in Foucault&#x27;s corpus is &quot;pouvoir/savoir&quot; (power/knowledge). With this term Foucault is referring to a type of knowledge that is considered &quot;common sense&quot;, but that is created and withheld in that position (as &quot;common sense&quot;) by power. The term power/knowledge comes from Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s idea that panopticons wouldn&#x27;t only be prisons, but would be used for experiments where the criminals&#x27; behaviour would be studied. Power/knowledge thus refers to forms of power where the power compares individuals, measures differences, establishes a norm and then forces this norm unto the subjects. This is especially successful when the established norm is internalized and institutionalized (by &quot;institutionalized&quot; Foucault refers to when the norm is omnipresent). Because then, when the norm is internalized and institutionalized, it has effectively become a part of peoples&#x27; &quot;common sense&quot;—the &quot;obvious&quot;, the &quot;given&quot;, the &quot;natural&quot;. When this has happened, this &quot;common sense&quot; also affects the explicit knowledge (scientific knowledge), Foucault argues. Ellen K. Feder states that the premise &quot;the world consists of women and men&quot; is an example of this. This premise, Feder argues, has been considered &quot;common sense&quot;, and has led to the creation of the psychiatric diagnosis gender identity disorder (GID). For example, during the 1970s, children with behavior that was not considered appropriate for their gender was diagnosed with GID. The treatment then consisted of trying to make the child adapt to the prevailing gender norms. Feder argues that this is an example of power/knowledge since psychiatry, from the &quot;common sense&quot; premise &quot;the world consists of women and men&quot; (a premise which is upheld in this status by power), created a new diagnosis, a new type of subject and a whole body of knowledge surrounding this new subject.

==Influence and reception==
Foucault&#x27;s works have exercised a powerful influence over numerous humanistic and social scientific disciplines as one of the most influential and controversial scholars of the post-World War II period. According to a London School of Economics&#x27; analysis in 2016, his works &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot; and &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot; were among the 25 most cited books in the social sciences of all time, at just over 100,000 citations. In 2007, Foucault was listed as the single most cited scholar in the humanities by the &quot;ISI Web of Science&quot; among a large quantity of French philosophers, the compilation&#x27;s author commenting that &quot;What this says of modern scholarship is for the reader to decide—and it is imagined that judgments will vary from admiration to despair, depending on one&#x27;s view&quot;.

According to Gary Gutting, Foucault&#x27;s &quot;detailed historical remarks on the emergence of disciplinary and regulatory biopower have been widely influential&quot;. Leo Bersani wrote that:&quot;[Foucault] is our most brilliant philosopher of power. More originally than any other contemporary thinker, he has attempted to define the historical constraints under which we live, at the same time that he has been anxious to account for—if possible, even to locate—the points at which we might resist those constraints and counter some of the moves of power. In the present climate of cynical disgust with the exercise of political power, Foucault&#x27;s importance can hardly be exaggerated.&quot; Foucault&#x27;s work on &quot;biopower&quot; has been widely influential within the disciplines of philosophy and political theory, particularly for such authors as Giorgio Agamben, Roberto Esposito, Antonio Negri, and Michael Hardt. His discussions on power and discourse have inspired many critical theorists, who believe that Foucault&#x27;s analysis of power structures could aid the struggle against inequality. They claim that through discourse analysis, hierarchies may be uncovered and questioned by way of analyzing the corresponding fields of knowledge through which they are legitimated. This is one of the ways that Foucault&#x27;s work is linked to critical theory. His work &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot; influenced his friend and contemporary Gilles Deleuze, who published the paper &quot;Postscript on the Societies of Control&quot;, praising Foucault&#x27;s work but arguing that contemporary western society has in fact developed from a &#x27;disciplinary society&#x27; into a &#x27;society of control&#x27;. Deleuze went on to publish a book dedicated to Foucault&#x27;s thought in 1988 under the title &quot;Foucault&quot;.

Foucault&#x27;s discussions of the relationship between power and knowledge has influenced postcolonial critiques in explaining the discursive formation of colonialism, particularly in Edward Said&#x27;s work &quot;Orientalism&quot;. Foucault&#x27;s work has been compared to that of Erving Goffman by the sociologist Michael Hviid Jacobsen and Soren Kristiansen, who list Goffman as an influence on Foucault. Foucault&#x27;s writings, particularly &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot;, have also been very influential in feminist philosophy and queer theory, particularly the work of the major Feminist scholar Judith Butler due to his theories regarding the genealogy of maleness and femaleness, power, sexuality, and bodies.

===Critiques and engagements===
Douglas Murray, writing in his book &quot;The War on The West&quot;, argued that &quot;Foucault&#x27;s obsessive analysis of everything through a quasi-Marxist lens of power relations diminished almost everything in society into a transactional, punitive and meaningless dystopia&quot;.

====Crypto-normativity, self-refutation, defeatism====

A prominent critique of Foucault&#x27;s thought concerns his refusal to propose positive solutions to the social and political issues that he critiques. Since no human relation is devoid of power, freedom becomes elusive—even as an ideal. This stance which critiques normativity as socially constructed and contingent, but which relies on an implicit norm to mount the critique led philosopher Jürgen Habermas to describe Foucault&#x27;s thinking as &quot;crypto-normativist&quot;, covertly reliant on the very Enlightenment principles he attempts to argue against. A similar critique has been advanced by Diana Taylor, and by Nancy Fraser who argues that &quot;Foucault&#x27;s critique encompasses traditional moral systems, he denies himself by recourse to concepts such as &#x27;freedom&#x27; and &#x27;justice&#x27;, and therefore lacks the ability to generate positive alternatives.&quot;

====Genealogy as historical method====

The philosopher Richard Rorty has argued that Foucault&#x27;s &quot;archaeology of knowledge&quot; is fundamentally negative, and thus fails to adequately establish any &quot;new&quot; theory of knowledge &quot;per se&quot;. Rather, Foucault simply provides a few valuable maxims regarding the reading of history. Rorty writes:

Genealogy emerged in Foucault&#x27;s writing in the early 1970s as a corrective to what he saw as deficiencies in the previous methodology he described as archaeology. Specifically Genealogy allowed Foucault a method to explain how &quot;the epistemological succession of discursive formations&quot; could occur within the methodology of the older Archaeology. 

Foucault has frequently been criticized by historians for what they consider to be a lack of rigor in his analyses. For example, Hans-Ulrich Wehler harshly criticized Foucault in 1998. According to Wehler, Foucault&#x27;s works are not only insufficient in their empirical historical aspects, but also often contradictory and lacking in clarity. For example, Foucault&#x27;s concept of power is &quot;desperatingly undifferentiated&quot;, and Foucault&#x27;s thesis of a &quot;disciplinary society&quot; is, according to Wehler, only possible because Foucault does not properly differentiate between authority, force, power, violence and legitimacy. 

T&#x27;Jampens and Versieren describe Foucault as having experienced a severe personal crisis at the start of his &quot;Il faut défendre la société&quot; lecture series on the basis of the account of Gilles Deleuze. They describe this crisis as the culmination of Foucault&#x27;s own doubts regarding &quot;certain key aspects of the genealogical method.&quot; They describe these lectures as the construction of a dialectic between the older archaeological method and the newer genealogical one, using the methodological tools of the first to correct Foucault&#x27;s self-identified flaws in the second. 

====Feminist critiques====
Though American feminists have built on Foucault&#x27;s critiques of the historical construction of gender roles and sexuality, some feminists note the limitations of the masculinist subjectivity and ethical orientation that he describes. A related issue raised by scholars Elizabeth Povinelli and Kathryn Yusoff is the almost complete absence of any discussion of race in his writings. Yusoff (2018, p. 211) says &quot;Povinelli draws our attention to the provinciality of Foucault&#x27;s project in its conceptualization of a Western European genealogy&quot;.

====Sexuality====
The philosopher Roger Scruton argues in &quot;Sexual Desire&quot; (1986) that Foucault was incorrect to claim, in &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot;, that sexual morality is culturally relative. He criticizes Foucault for assuming that there could be societies in which a &quot;problematisation&quot; of the sexual did not occur, concluding that, &quot;No history of thought could show the &#x27;problematisation&#x27; of sexual experience to be peculiar to certain specific social formations: it is characteristic of personal experience generally, and therefore of every genuine social order.&quot;

Foucault&#x27;s approach to sexuality, which he sees as socially constructed, has become influential in queer theory. Foucault&#x27;s resistance to identity politics, and his rejection of the psychoanalytic concept of &quot;object choice&quot;, stand at odds with some theories of queer identity.

====Social constructionism and human nature====

Foucault is sometimes criticized for his purported social constructionism, which some see as an affront to the concept of truth. In Foucault&#x27;s 1971 televised debate with Noam Chomsky, Foucault argued against the possibility of any fixed human nature, as posited by Chomsky&#x27;s concept of innate human faculties. Chomsky argued that concepts of justice were rooted in human reason, whereas Foucault rejected the universal basis for a concept of justice. Following the debate, Chomsky was stricken with Foucault&#x27;s total rejection of the possibility of a universal morality, stating &quot;He struck me as completely amoral, I&#x27;d never met anyone who was so totally amoral [...] I mean, I liked him personally, it&#x27;s just that I couldn&#x27;t make sense of him. It&#x27;s as if he was from a different species, or something.&quot;

====Defeatism in education and authority====
Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa, while acknowledging that Foucault contributed to give a right of citizenship in cultural life to certain marginal and eccentric experiences (of sexuality, of cultural repression, of madness), asserts that his radical critique of authority was detrimental to education.

====Psychology of the self====

One of Foucault&#x27;s claims regarding the subjectivity of the self has been disputed. Opposing Foucault&#x27;s view of subjectivity, Terje Sparby, Friedrich Edelhäuser, and Ulrich W. Weger argue that other factors, such as biological, environmental, and cultural are explanations for the self.

====&quot;Forget Foucault&quot;====
Jean Baudrillard&#x27;s 1977 tract &quot;Oublier Foucault&quot; (trans. &quot;Forget Foucault&quot;) made Baudrillard instantly infamous within France, as it was a devastating critical analysis of Foucault&#x27;s book the &quot;History of Sexuality&quot;—and of Foucault&#x27;s entire oeuvre. In 1976, Jean Baudrillard sent this essay to the French magazine Critique, where Michel Foucault was an editor. Foucault was asked to reply, but remained silent. In it Baudrillard also launched an attacks on those philosophers, like Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, who believed that sexual desire and sexual liberation could be a revolutionary force. Baudrillard asserted that &quot;Foucault&#x27;s discourse is a mirror of the powers it describes.&quot; Since &quot;it is possible at last to talk with such definitive understanding about power, sexuality, the body, and discipline [...] it is because at some point all this is here and now over with.&quot; Therefore, with &quot;the coincidence between this new version of power and the new version of desire proposed by Deleuze and Lyotard [...] [which was] not accidental: it&#x27;s simply that in Foucault power takes the place of desire [...] That is why there is no desire in Foucault: its place is already taken [...] When power blends into desire and desire blends into power, let&#x27;s forget them both.&quot;

&quot;Oublier Foucault&quot; was published in English in 1998 as part of the Semiotext(e) Foreign Agents series as &quot;Forget Foucault&quot;.

<doc id="47646" wikidata="Q339747" url="?curid=47646" title="Hippie">
<text>A hippie, also spelled hippy, especially in British English, is someone associated with the counterculture of the mid-1960s to early 1970s, originally a youth movement that began in the United States and spread to different countries around the world. The word &quot;hippie&quot; came from &quot;hipster&quot; and was used to describe beatniks who moved into New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village, San Francisco&#x27;s Haight-Ashbury district, and Chicago&#x27;s Old Town community. The term &quot;hippie&quot; was used in print by San Francisco writer Michael Fallon, helping popularize use of the term in the media, although the tag was seen elsewhere earlier.

The origins of the terms &quot;hip&quot; and &quot;hep&quot; are uncertain. By the 1940s, both had become part of African American jive slang and meant &quot;sophisticated; currently fashionable; fully up-to-date&quot;. The Beats adopted the term &quot;hip&quot;, and early hippies adopted the language and countercultural values of the Beat Generation. Hippies created their own communities, listened to psychedelic music, embraced the sexual revolution, and many used drugs such as marijuana and LSD to explore altered states of consciousness.

In 1967, the Human Be-In in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, and the Monterey International Pop Festival popularized hippie culture, leading to the Summer of Love on the West Coast of the United States, and the 1969 Woodstock Festival on the East Coast. Hippies in Mexico, known as &quot;jipitecas&quot;, formed &quot;La Onda&quot; (the Wave) and gathered at Avándaro, while in New Zealand, nomadic housetruckers practiced alternative lifestyles and promoted sustainable energy at Nambassa. In the United Kingdom in 1970, many gathered at the gigantic third Isle of Wight Festival with a crowd of around 400,000 people. In later years, mobile &quot;peace convoys&quot; of New Age travellers made summer pilgrimages to free music festivals at Stonehenge and elsewhere. In Australia, hippies gathered at Nimbin for the 1973 Aquarius Festival and the annual Cannabis Law Reform Rally or MardiGrass. &quot;&quot;Piedra Roja&quot; Festival&quot;, a major hippie event in Chile, was held in 1970. Hippie and psychedelic culture influenced 1960s to mid 1970s teenager and youth culture in Iron Curtain countries in Eastern Europe (see &quot;Mánička&quot;).

Hippie fashion and values had a major effect on culture, influencing popular music, television, film, literature, and the arts. Since the 1960s, mainstream society has assimilated many aspects of hippie culture. The religious and cultural diversity the hippies espoused has gained widespread acceptance, and their pop versions of Eastern philosophy and Asiatic spiritual concepts have reached a larger group. The vast majority of people who had participated in the golden age of the hippie movement were those born soon after the end of World War II, during the late 1940s and early 1950s. These include the youngest of the Silent Generation and oldest of the Baby Boomers; the former who were the actual leaders of the movement as well as the early pioneers of rock music.

==Etymology==

Lexicographer Jesse Sheidlower, the principal American editor of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, argues that the terms &quot;hipster&quot; and &quot;hippie&quot; are derived from the word &quot;hip&quot;, whose origins are unknown. The word &quot;hip&quot; in the sense of &quot;aware, in the know&quot; is first attested in a 1902 cartoon by Tad Dorgan, and first appeared in prose in a 1904 novel by George Vere Hobart (1867–1926), &quot;Jim Hickey: A Story of the One-Night Stands&quot;, where an African-American character uses the slang phrase &quot;Are you hip?&quot;

The term &quot;hipster&quot; was coined by Harry Gibson in 1944. By the 1940s, the terms &quot;hip&quot;, &quot;hep&quot; and &quot;hepcat&quot; were popular in Harlem jazz slang, although &quot;hep&quot; eventually came to denote an inferior status to &quot;hip&quot;. In Greenwich Village in the early 1960s, New York City, young counterculture advocates were named &quot;hips&quot; because they were considered &quot;in the know&quot; or &quot;cool&quot;, as opposed to being &quot;square&quot;, meaning conventional and old-fashioned. In the April 27, 1961 issue of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, &quot;An open letter to JFK &amp; Fidel Castro&quot;, Norman Mailer utilizes the term hippies, in questioning JFK&#x27;s behavior. In a 1961 essay, Kenneth Rexroth used both the terms &quot;hipster&quot; and &quot;hippies&quot; to refer to young people participating in black American or Beatnik nightlife. According to Malcolm X&#x27;s 1964 autobiography, the word &quot;hippie&quot; in 1940s Harlem had been used to describe a specific type of white man who &quot;acted more Negro than Negroes&quot;. Andrew Loog Oldham refers to &quot;all the Chicago hippies,&quot; seemingly about black blues/R&amp;B musicians, in his rear sleeve notes to the 1965 LP &quot;The Rolling Stones, Now!&quot;

Although the word &quot;hippies&quot; made other isolated appearances in print during the early 1960s, the first use of the term on the West Coast appeared in the article &quot;A New Paradise for Beatniks&quot; (in the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, issue of September 5, 1965) by San Francisco journalist Michael Fallon. In that article, Fallon wrote about the Blue Unicorn Cafe (coffeehouse) (located at 1927 Hayes Street in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco), using the term &quot;hippie&quot; to refer to the new generation of beatniks who had moved from North Beach into the Haight-Ashbury district.

==History==
=== Origins ===
A July 1967 &quot;Time&quot; magazine study on hippie philosophy credited the foundation of the hippie movement with historical precedent as far back as the sadhu of India, the spiritual seekers who had renounced the world and materialistic pursuits by taking &quot;Sannyas&quot;. Even the counterculture of the Ancient Greeks, espoused by philosophers like Diogenes of Sinope and the cynics were also early forms of hippie culture. It also named as notable influences the religious and spiritual teachings of Buddha, Hillel the Elder, Jesus, St. Francis of Assisi, Henry David Thoreau, Gandhi and J. R. R. Tolkien.

The first signs of modern &quot;proto-hippies&quot; emerged at the end of the 19th century in Europe. Late 1890s to early 1900s, a German youth movement arose as a countercultural reaction to the organized social and cultural clubs that centered on &quot;German folk music&quot;. Known as &quot;Der Wandervogel&quot; (&quot;wandering bird&quot;), this hippie movement opposed the formality of traditional German clubs, instead emphasizing folk music and singing, creative dress, and outdoor life involving hiking and camping. Inspired by the works of Goethe, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Hermann Hesse, Wandervogel attracted thousands of young Germans who rejected the rapid trend toward urbanization and yearned for the pagan, back-to-nature spiritual life of their ancestors. During the first several decades of the 20th century, Germans settled around the United States, bringing the values of this German youth culture. Some opened the first health food stores, and many moved to southern California where they introduced an alternative lifestyle. One group, called the &quot;Nature Boys&quot;, took to the California desert and raised organic food, espousing a back-to-nature lifestyle like the Wandervogel. Songwriter eden ahbez wrote a hit song called &quot;Nature Boy&quot; inspired by Robert Bootzin (Gypsy Boots), who helped popularize health-consciousness, yoga, and organic food in the United States.
The hippie movement in the United States began as a youth movement. Composed mostly of white teenagers and young adults between 15 and 25 years old, hippies inherited a tradition of cultural dissent from bohemians and beatniks of the Beat Generation in the late 1950s. Beats like Allen Ginsberg crossed over from the beat movement and became fixtures of the burgeoning hippie and anti-war movements. By 1965, hippies had become an established social group in the U.S., and the movement eventually expanded to other countries, extending as far as the United Kingdom and Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, Mexico, and Brazil. The hippie ethos influenced the Beatles and others in the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe, and they in turn influenced their American counterparts. Hippie culture spread worldwide through a fusion of rock music, folk, blues, and psychedelic rock; it also found expression in literature, the dramatic arts, fashion, and the visual arts, including film, posters advertising rock concerts, and album covers. In 1968, &quot;core visible hippies&quot; represented just under 0.2% of the U.S. population and dwindled away by mid-1970s.

Along with the New Left and the Civil Rights Movement, the hippie movement was one of three dissenting groups of the 1960s counterculture. Hippies rejected established institutions, criticized middle class values, opposed nuclear weapons and the Vietnam War, embraced aspects of Eastern philosophy, championed sexual liberation, were often vegetarian and eco-friendly, promoted the use of psychedelic drugs which they believed expanded one&#x27;s consciousness, and created intentional communities or communes. They used alternative arts, street theatre, folk music, and psychedelic rock as a part of their lifestyle and as a way of expressing their feelings, their protests, and their vision of the world and life. Hippies opposed political and social orthodoxy, choosing a gentle and nondoctrinaire ideology that favored peace, love, and personal freedom, expressed for example in the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;All You Need is Love&quot;. Hippies perceived the dominant culture as a corrupt, monolithic entity that exercised undue power over their lives, calling this culture &quot;the Establishment&quot;, &quot;Big Brother&quot;, or &quot;the Man&quot;. Noting that they were &quot;seekers of meaning and value&quot;, scholars like Timothy Miller have described hippies as a new religious movement.

===1958–1965: Early hippies===
During the late 1950s and early 1960s, novelist Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters lived communally first in Oregon and after the 1962 success of his novel &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; in his San Francisco villa. Members included Beat Generation hero Neal Cassady, Ken Babbs, Carolyn Adams (aka Mountain Girl/Carolyn Garcia), Stewart Brand, Del Close, Paul Foster, George Walker, Sandy Lehmann-Haupt and others. Their adventures were documented in Tom Wolfe&#x27;s book &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot;. With Cassady at the wheel of a school bus named Further, the Merry Pranksters traveled across the United States to celebrate the publication of Kesey&#x27;s novel &quot;Sometimes a Great Notion&quot; and to visit the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair in New York City. The Merry Pranksters were known for using cannabis, amphetamine, and LSD, and during their journey they &quot;turned on&quot; many people to these drugs. The Merry Pranksters filmed and audio-taped their bus trips, creating an immersive multimedia experience that would later be presented to the public in the form of festivals and concerts. The Grateful Dead wrote a song about the Merry Pranksters&#x27; bus trips called &quot;That&#x27;s It for the Other One&quot;.

In 1961, Vito Paulekas and his wife Szou established in Hollywood a clothing boutique which was credited with being one of the first to introduce &quot;hippie&quot; fashions.

During this period Greenwich Village in New York City and Berkeley, California anchored the American folk music circuit.

Berkeley&#x27;s two coffee houses, &quot;the Cabale Creamery&quot; and &quot;the Jabberwock&quot;, sponsored performances by folk music artists in a beat setting.

In April 1963, Chandler A. Laughlin III, co-founder of the Cabale Creamery, established a kind of tribal, family identity among approximately fifty people who attended a traditional, all-night Native American peyote ceremony in a rural setting. This ceremony combined a psychedelic experience with traditional Native American spiritual values; these people went on to sponsor a unique genre of musical expression and performance at the &quot;Red Dog Saloon&quot; in the isolated, old-time mining town of Virginia City, Nevada.

===1965–1967: Rise to prevalence===
During the summer of 1965, Laughlin recruited much of the original talent that led to a unique amalgam of traditional folk music and the developing psychedelic rock scene. He and his cohorts created at this very place what became known as &quot;The Red Dog Experience&quot;, featuring previously unknown musical acts—Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Quicksilver Messenger Service, the Charlatans, and others—who played in the completely refurbished, intimate setting of Nevada, Virginia City&#x27;s &quot;Red Dog Saloon&quot;. There was no clear delineation between &quot;performers&quot; and &quot;audience&quot; in &quot;The Red Dog Experience&quot;, during which music, psychedelic experimentation, a unique sense of personal style, and Bill Ham&#x27;s first primitive light shows combined to create a new sense of community. Laughlin and George Hunter of the Charlatans were true &quot;proto-hippies&quot;, with their long hair, boots, and outrageous clothing of 19th-century American (and Native American) heritage. LSD manufacturer Owsley Stanley lived in Berkeley during 1965 and provided much of the LSD that became a seminal part of the &quot;Red Dog Experience&quot;, the early evolution of psychedelic rock and budding hippie culture. At the &quot;Red Dog Saloon&quot;, the Charlatans were the first psychedelic rock band to play live (albeit unintentionally) loaded on LSD.

When they returned to San Francisco, &quot;Red Dog&quot; participants Luria Castell, Ellen Harman and Alton Kelley created a collective called &quot;the Family Dog.&quot; Modeled on their &quot;Red Dog experiences&quot;, on October 16, 1965, the &quot;Family Dog&quot; hosted &quot;A Tribute to Dr. Strange&quot; at Longshoreman&#x27;s Hall. Attended by approximately one thousand of the Bay Area&#x27;s original &quot;hippies&quot;, this was San Francisco&#x27;s first psychedelic rock performance, costumed dance and light show, featuring Jefferson Airplane, the Great Society and the Marbles. Two other events followed before year&#x27;s end, one at &quot;California Hall&quot; and one at &quot;the Matrix&quot;. After the first three &quot;Family Dog&quot; events, a much larger psychedelic event occurred at San Francisco&#x27;s &quot;Longshoreman&#x27;s Hall&quot;. Called the &quot;Trips Festival&quot;, it took place on January 21 – 23, 1966, and was organized by Stewart Brand, Ken Kesey, Owsley Stanley and others. Ten thousand people attended this sold-out event, with a thousand more turned away each night. On Saturday January 22, the Grateful Dead and Big Brother and the Holding Company came on stage, and six thousand people arrived to imbibe punch spiked with LSD and to witness one of the first fully developed light shows of the era.

By February 1966, the &quot;Family Dog&quot; became &quot;Family Dog Productions&quot; under organizer Chet Helms, promoting happenings at the Avalon Ballroom and the Fillmore Auditorium in initial cooperation with Bill Graham. The Avalon Ballroom, the Fillmore Auditorium, and other venues provided settings where participants could partake of the full psychedelic music experience. Bill Ham, who had pioneered the original &quot;Red Dog&quot; light shows, perfected his art of liquid light projection, which combined light shows and film projection and became with the &quot;San Francisco ballroom experience&quot;. The sense of style and costume that began at the &quot;Red Dog Saloon&quot; flourished when San Francisco&#x27;s Fox Theater went out of business and hippies bought up its costume stock, reveling in the freedom to dress up for weekly musical performances at their favorite ballrooms. As &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; music columnist Ralph J. Gleason put it, &quot;They danced all night long, orgiastic, spontaneous and completely free form.&quot;

Some of the earliest San Francisco hippies were former students at San Francisco State College who became intrigued by the developing psychedelic hippie music scene. These students joined the bands they loved, living communally in the large, inexpensive Victorian apartments in the Haight-Ashbury. Young Americans around the country began moving to San Francisco, and by June 1966, around 15,000 hippies had moved into the Haight. the Charlatans, Jefferson Airplane, Big Brother and the Holding Company, and the Grateful Dead all moved to San Francisco&#x27;s Haight-Ashbury neighborhood during this period. Activity centered on the Diggers, a guerrilla street theatre group that combined spontaneous street theatre, anarchistic action, and art happenings in their agenda to create a &quot;free city&quot;. By late 1966, the Diggers opened free stores which simply gave away their stock, provided free food, distributed free drugs, gave away money, organized free music concerts, and performed works of political art.

On October 6, 1966, the state of California declared LSD a controlled substance, which made the drug illegal. In response to the criminalization of LSD, San Francisco hippies staged a gathering in the Golden Gate Park panhandle, called the Love Pageant Rally, attracting an estimated 700–800 people. As explained by Allan Cohen, co-founder of the &quot;San Francisco Oracle&quot;, the purpose of the rally was twofold: to draw attention to the fact that LSD had just been made illegal—and to demonstrate that people who used LSD were not criminals, nor were they mentally ill. The Grateful Dead played, and some sources claim that LSD was consumed at the rally. According to Cohen, those who took LSD &quot;were not guilty of using illegal substances...We were celebrating transcendental consciousness, the beauty of the universe, the beauty of being.&quot;

In West Hollywood, California, the Sunset Strip curfew riots, also known as the &quot;hippie riots&quot;, were a series of early counterculture-era clashes that took place between police and young people in 1966 and continuing on and off through the early 1970s. In 1966, annoyed residents and business owners in the district had encouraged the passage of strict (10:00 p.m.) curfew and loitering laws to reduce the traffic congestion resulting from crowds of young club patrons. This was perceived by young, local rock music fans as an infringement on their civil rights, and on Saturday, November 12, 1966, fliers were distributed along the Strip inviting people to demonstrate later that day. Hours before the protest one of the rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll radio stations in L.A. announced there would be a rally at Pandora&#x27;s Box, a club at the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Crescent Heights, and cautioned people to tread carefully. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that as many as 1,000 youthful demonstrators, including such celebrities as Jack Nicholson and Peter Fonda (who was afterward handcuffed by police), erupted in protest against the perceived repressive enforcement of these recently invoked curfew laws. This incident provided the basis for the 1967 low-budget teen exploitation film &quot;Riot on Sunset Strip&quot;, and inspired multiple songs including the famous Buffalo Springfield song &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot;.

===1967: Human Be-In, Summer of Love, and popularity surge===

On January 14, 1967, the outdoor Human Be-In organized by Michael Bowen helped to popularize hippie culture across the United States, with 20,000 to 30,000 hippies gathering in San Francisco&#x27;s Golden Gate Park.

On March 26, 1967, Lou Reed, Edie Sedgwick and 10,000 hippies came together in Manhattan for the Central Park Be-In on Easter Sunday.

The KFRC Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival from June 10–11, and the Monterey Pop Festival from June 16–18, introduced the music of the counterculture - and the new concept of a rock festival - to a wide audience, and marked the start of the &quot;Summer of Love&quot;.

Scott McKenzie&#x27;s rendition of John Phillips&#x27; song &quot;San Francisco&quot; became a hit in the United States and Europe. The lyrics, &quot;If you&#x27;re going to San Francisco, be sure to wear some flowers in your hair&quot;, inspired thousands of young people from all over the world to travel to San Francisco, sometimes wearing flowers in their hair and distributing flowers to passersby, earning them the name &quot;Flower Children&quot;. Bands like the Grateful Dead, Big Brother and the Holding Company (with Janis Joplin), and Jefferson Airplane lived in the Haight.

In June 1967, Herb Caen was approached by &quot;a distinguished magazine&quot; to write about why hippies were attracted to San Francisco. He declined the assignment but interviewed hippies in the Haight for his own newspaper column in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. Caen determined that, &quot;Except in their music, they couldn&#x27;t care less about the approval of the straight world.&quot; Caen himself felt that the city of San Francisco was so straight that it provided a visible contrast with hippie culture.

On July 7, 1967 &quot;Time&quot; magazine featured a cover story entitled &quot;The Hippies: The Philosophy of a Subculture.&quot; The article described the guidelines of the hippie code:

It is estimated that around 100,000 people traveled to San Francisco in the summer of 1967. The media was right behind them, casting a spotlight on the Haight-Ashbury district and popularizing the &quot;hippie&quot; label. With this increased attention, hippies found support for their ideals of love and peace but were also criticized for their anti-work, pro-drug, and permissive ethos.
At this point, the Beatles had released their groundbreaking album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, which was quickly embraced by the hippie movement with its colorful psychedelic sonic imagery.

In 1967 Chet Helms brought the Haight Ashbury hippie and psychedelic scene to Denver, when he opened the Family Dog Denver, modeled on his Avalon Ballroom in San Francisco. The music venue created a nexus for the hippie movement in the western-minded Denver, which led to serious conflicts with city leaders, parents and the police, who saw the hippie movement as dangerous. The resulting legal actions and pressure caused Helms and Bob Cohen to close the venue at the end of that year.

By the end of the summer, the Haight-Ashbury scene had deteriorated. The incessant media coverage led the Diggers to declare the &quot;death&quot; of the hippie with a parade. According to poet Susan &#x27;Stormi&#x27; Chambless, the hippies buried an effigy of a hippie in the Panhandle to demonstrate the end of his/her reign. Haight-Ashbury could not accommodate the influx of crowds (mostly naive youngsters) with no place to live. Many took to living on the street, panhandling and drug-dealing. There were problems with malnourishment, disease, and drug addiction. Crime and violence skyrocketed. None of these trends reflected what the hippies had envisioned. 
By the end of 1967, many of the hippies and musicians who initiated the Summer of Love had moved on. Beatle George Harrison had once visited Haight-Ashbury and found it to be just a haven for dropouts, inspiring him to give up LSD. Misgivings about the hippie culture, particularly with regard to substance use and lenient morality, fueled the moral panics of the late 1960s.

===1967–1970: Revolution and peak of influence===

By 1968, hippie-influenced fashions were beginning to take off in the mainstream, especially for youths and younger adults of the populous baby boomer generation, many of whom may have aspired to emulate the hardcore movements now living in tribalistic communes, but had no overt connections to them. This was noticed not only in terms of clothes and longer hair for men, but also in music, film, art and literature, not just in the United States, but around the world. Eugene McCarthy&#x27;s brief presidential campaign successfully persuaded a significant minority of young adults to &quot;get clean for Gene&quot; by shaving their beards or wearing longer skirts; however the &quot;Clean Genes&quot; had little impact on the popular image in the media spotlight, of the hirsute hippy adorned in beads, feathers, flowers and bells.

A sign of this was the visibility that the hippie subculture gained in various mainstream and underground media. Hippie exploitation films are 1960s exploitation films about the hippie counterculture with stereotypical situations associated with the movement such as cannabis and LSD use, sex and wild psychedelic parties. Examples include &quot;The Love-ins&quot;, &quot;Psych-Out&quot;, &quot;The Trip&quot;, and &quot;Wild in the Streets&quot;. Other more serious and more critically acclaimed films about the hippie counterculture also appeared such as &quot;Easy Rider&quot; and &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot;. (See also: List of films related to the hippie subculture.) Documentaries and television programs have also been produced until today as well as fiction and nonfiction books. The popular Broadway musical &quot;Hair&quot; was presented in 1967.

People commonly label other cultural movements of that period as hippie, but there are differences. For example, hippies were often not directly engaged in politics, as contrasted with &quot;Yippies&quot; (Youth International Party), an activist organization. The Yippies came to national attention during their celebration of the 1968 spring equinox, when some 3,000 of them took over Grand Central Terminal in New York—eventually resulting in 61 arrests. Especially their leaders Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, the Yippies became notorious for their theatrics, such as trying to levitate the Pentagon at the October 1967 war protest, and such slogans as &quot;Rise up and abandon the creeping meatball!&quot; Their stated intention to protest the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August, including nominating their own candidate, &quot;Lyndon Pigasus Pig&quot; (an actual pig), was also widely publicized in the media at this time.

In Cambridge, Massachusetts hippies congregated each Sunday for a large &quot;be-in&quot; at Cambridge Common with swarms of drummers and those beginning the Women&#x27;s Movement. In the United States, the Hippie movement started to be seen as part of the &quot;New Left&quot;, which was associated with anti-war college-campus protest movements. The New Left was a term used mainly in the United Kingdom and United States in reference to activists, educators, agitators and others in the 1960s and 1970s who sought to implement a broad range of reforms on issues such as gay rights, abortion, gender roles and drugs in contrast to earlier leftist or Marxist movements that had taken a more vanguardist approach to social justice and focused mostly on labor unionization and questions of social class.

In April 1969, the building of People&#x27;s Park in Berkeley, California received international attention. The University of California, Berkeley had demolished all the buildings on a parcel near campus, intending to use the land to build playing fields and a parking lot. After a long delay, during which the site became a dangerous eyesore, thousands of ordinary Berkeley citizens, merchants, students, and hippies took matters into their own hands, planting trees, shrubs, flowers and grass to convert the land into a park. A major confrontation ensued on May 15, 1969, when Governor Ronald Reagan ordered the park destroyed, which led to a two-week occupation of the city of Berkeley by the California National Guard. Flower power came into its own during this occupation as hippies engaged in acts of civil disobedience to plant flowers in empty lots all over Berkeley under the slogan &quot;Let a Thousand Parks Bloom&quot;.
In August 1969, the Woodstock Music and Art Fair took place in Bethel, New York, which for many, exemplified the best of hippie counterculture. Over 500,000 people arrived to hear some of the most notable musicians and bands of the era, among them Canned Heat, Richie Havens, Joan Baez, Janis Joplin, Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, Carlos Santana, Sly and the Family Stone, the Who, Jefferson Airplane and Jimi Hendrix. Wavy Gravy&#x27;s Hog Farm provided security and attended to practical needs, and the hippie ideals of love and human fellowship seemed to have gained real-world expression. Similar rock festivals occurred in other parts of the country, which played a significant role in spreading hippie ideals throughout America.

In December 1969, a rock festival took place in Altamont, California, about 45 km (30 miles) east of San Francisco. Initially billed as &quot;Woodstock West&quot;, its official name was the Altamont Free Concert. About 300,000 people gathered to hear the Rolling Stones; Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young; Jefferson Airplane and other bands. The Hells Angels provided security that proved far less benevolent than the security provided at the Woodstock event: 18-year-old Meredith Hunter was stabbed and killed by one of the Hells Angels during the Rolling Stones&#x27; performance after he brandished a gun and waved it toward the stage.

===1970–1973: Aftershocks and decline===
By the 1970s, the 1960s zeitgeist that had spawned hippie culture seemed to be on the wane. The events at the Altamont Free Concert shocked many Americans, including those who had strongly identified with hippie culture. Another shock came in the form of the Sharon Tate and Leno and Rosemary LaBianca murders committed in August 1969 by Charles Manson and his &quot;family&quot; of followers.

Nevertheless, the turbulent political atmosphere that featured the bombing of Cambodia and shootings by National Guardsmen at Jackson State University and Kent State University still brought people together. These shootings inspired the May 1970 song by Quicksilver Messenger Service &quot;What About Me?&quot;, where they sang, &quot;You keep adding to my numbers as you shoot my people down&quot;, as well as Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Ohio&quot;, a song that protested the Kent State massacre, recorded by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. The anti-war movement reached its peak at the 1971 May Day Protests as over 12,000 protesters were arrested in Washington, D.C.; President Nixon himself actually ventured out of the White House and chatted with a group of the hippie protesters. The draft was ended soon thereafter, in January 1973.

===1973–present: Absorption into the mainstream and new developments===
Much of hippie style had been integrated into mainstream American society by the early 1970s. Large rock concerts that originated with the 1967 KFRC Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival and Monterey Pop Festival and the British Isle of Wight Festival in 1968 became the norm, evolving into stadium rock in the process. During the mid-late 1970s, with the end of the draft and the Vietnam War, a renewal of patriotic sentiment associated with the approach of the United States Bicentennial, the decline in popularity of psychedelic rock, and the emergence of new genres such as prog rock, heavy metal, disco, and punk rock, the mainstream media lost interest in the hippie counterculture. At the same time there was a revival of the Mod subculture, skinheads, teddy boys and the emergence of new youth cultures, like the punks, goths (an arty offshoot of punk), and football casuals; starting in the late 1960s and early 1970s in Britain, hippies had begun to come under attack by skinheads.

Many hippies would adapt and become members of the growing countercultural New Age movement of the 1970s. While many hippies made a long-term commitment to the lifestyle, some people argue that hippies &quot;sold out&quot; during the 1980s and became part of the materialist, self-centered consumer yuppie culture. Although not as visible as it once was, hippie culture has never died out completely: hippies and neo-hippies can still be found on college campuses, on communes, and at gatherings and festivals. Many embrace the hippie values of peace, love, and community, and hippies may still be found in bohemian enclaves around the world. Hippie communes, where members tried to live the ideals of the hippie movement, continued to flourish. On the West Coast, Oregon had quite a few, while in 1970, the hippie community of Tawapa was founded in New Mexico. It lasted until the 1990s, when the people were pushed off the land due to housing developments. Around 1994, a new term, &quot;Zippie&quot;, was being used to describe hippies that had embraced New Age beliefs, new technology, and a love for electronic music.

==Ethos and characteristics==
The bohemian predecessor of the hippie culture in San Francisco was the &quot;Beat Generation&quot; style of coffee houses and bars, whose clientele appreciated literature, a game of chess, music (in the forms of jazz and folk style), modern dance, and traditional crafts and arts like pottery and painting.&quot; The entire tone of the &quot;new&quot; subculture was different. Jon McIntire, manager of the Grateful Dead from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s, points out that the great contribution of the hippie culture was this projection of joy. &quot;The beatnik thing was black, cynical, and cold.&quot; Hippies sought to free themselves from societal restrictions, choose their own way, and find new meaning in life. One expression of hippie independence from societal norms was found in their standard of dress and grooming, which made hippies instantly recognizable to one another, and served as a visual symbol of their respect for individual rights. Through their appearance, hippies declared their willingness to question authority, and distanced themselves from the &quot;straight&quot; and &quot;square&quot; (i.e., conformist) segments of society. Personality traits and values that hippies tend to be associated with are &quot;altruism and mysticism, honesty, joy and nonviolence&quot;.

===Art and fashion===
Leading proponents of the 1960s Psychedelic Art movement were San Francisco poster artists such as Rick Griffin, Victor Moscoso, Bonnie MacLean, Stanley Mouse and Alton Kelley, and Wes Wilson. Their psychedelic-rock concert posters were inspired by Art Nouveau, Victoriana, Dada, and Pop Art. Posters for concerts in the Fillmore West, a concert auditorium in San Francisco, popular with hippie audiences, were among the most notable of the time. Richly saturated colors in glaring contrast, elaborately ornate lettering, strongly symmetrical composition, collage elements, rubber-like distortions, and bizarre iconography are all hallmarks of the San Francisco psychedelic poster art style. The style flourished from roughly the years 1966 until 1972. Their work was immediately influential to album cover art, and indeed all of the aforementioned artists also created album covers.

Psychedelic light shows were a new art form developed for rock concerts. Using oil and dye in an emulsion that was set between large convex lenses upon overhead projectors, the light-show artists created bubbling liquid visuals that pulsed in rhythm to the music. This was mixed with slide shows and film loops to create an improvisational motion picture art form, and to give visual representation to the improvisational jams of the rock bands and create a completely &quot;trippy&quot; atmosphere for the audience.
The Brotherhood of Light were responsible for many of the light shows in San Francisco psychedelic rock concerts.
Out of the psychedelic counterculture there also arose a new genre of comic books: underground comix. &quot;Zap Comix&quot; was among the original underground comics, and featured the work of Robert Crumb, S. Clay Wilson, Victor Moscoso, Rick Griffin, and Robert Williams among others. Underground comix were ribald and intensely satirical, and seemed to pursue weirdness for the sake of weirdness. Gilbert Shelton created perhaps the most enduring of underground cartoon characters, &quot;The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers&quot;, whose drugged-out exploits held a mirror up to the hippie lifestyle of the 1960s.

As in the beat movement preceding them, and the punk movement that followed soon after, hippie symbols and iconography were purposely borrowed from either &quot;low&quot; or &quot;primitive&quot; cultures, with hippie fashion reflecting a disorderly, often vagrant style. 
As with other adolescent, whitebread middle-class movements, deviant behavior of the hippies involved challenging the prevailing gender differences of their time: both men and women in the hippie movement wore jeans and maintained long hair, and both genders wore sandals, moccasins or went barefoot. Men often wore beards, while women wore little or no makeup, with many going braless. Hippies often chose brightly colored clothing and wore unusual styles, such as bell-bottom pants, vests, tie-dyed garments, dashikis, peasant blouses, and long, full skirts; non-Western inspired clothing with Native American, Latin American, African and Asiatic motifs was also popular. Much hippie clothing was self-made in defiance of corporate culture, and hippies often purchased their clothes from flea markets and second-hand shops. Favored accessories for both men and women included Native American jewelry, head scarves, headbands and long beaded necklaces. Hippie homes, vehicles and other possessions were often decorated with psychedelic art. The bold colors, hand-made clothing and loose fitting clothes opposed the tight and uniform clothing of the 1940s and 1950s. It also rejected consumerism in that the hand-production of clothing called for self-efficiency and individuality.

=== Love and sex ===

The common stereotype on the issues of love and sex had it that the hippies were &quot;promiscuous, having wild sex orgies, seducing innocent teenagers and every manner of sexual perversion.&quot; The hippie movement appeared concurrently in the midst of a rising sexual revolution, in which many views of the &quot;status quo&quot; on this subject were being challenged.

The clinical study &quot;Human Sexual Response&quot; was published by Masters and Johnson in 1966, and the topic suddenly became more commonplace in America. The 1969 book &quot;Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask)&quot; by psychiatrist David Reuben was a more popular attempt at answering the public&#x27;s curiosity regarding such matters. Then in 1972 appeared &quot;The Joy of Sex&quot; by Alex Comfort, reflecting an even more candid perception of love-making. By this time, the recreational or &#x27;fun&#x27; aspects of sexual behavior were being discussed more openly than ever before, and this more &#x27;enlightened&#x27; outlook resulted not just from the publication of such new books as these, but from a more pervasive sexual revolution that had already been well underway for some time.

The hippies inherited various countercultural views and practices regarding sex and love from the Beat Generation; &quot;their writings influenced the hippies to open up when it came to sex, and to experiment without guilt or jealousy.&quot; One popular hippie slogan that appeared was &quot;If it feels good, do it!&quot; which for many meant &quot;you are free to love whomever you please, whenever you please, however you please&quot;. This encouraged spontaneous sexual activity and experimentation. Group sex, public sex, homosexuality; under the influence of drugs, all the taboos went out the window. This doesn&#x27;t mean that straight sex or monogamy were unknown, quite the contrary. Nevertheless, the open relationship became an accepted part of the hippie lifestyle. This meant that you might have a primary relationship with one person, but if another attracted you, you could explore that relationship without rancor or jealousy.&quot;

Hippies embraced the old slogan of free love of the radical social reformers of other eras; it was accordingly observed that &quot;Free love made the whole love, marriage, sex, baby package obsolete. Love was no longer limited to one person, you could love anyone you chose. In fact love was something you shared with everyone, not just your sex partners. Love exists to be shared freely. We also discovered the more you share, the more you get! So why reserve your love for a select few? This profound truth was one of the great hippie revelations.&quot; Sexual experimentation alongside psychedelics also occurred, due to the perception of their being uninhibitors. Others explored the spiritual aspects of sex.

===Travel===
Hippies tended to travel light, and could pick up and go wherever the action was at any time. Whether at a love-in on Mount Tamalpais near San Francisco, a demonstration against the Vietnam War in Berkeley, or one of Ken Kesey&#x27;s &quot;Acid Tests&quot;, if the &quot;vibe&quot; was not right and a change of scene was desired, hippies were mobile at a moment&#x27;s notice. Planning was eschewed, as hippies were happy to put a few clothes in a backpack, stick out their thumbs and hitchhike anywhere. Hippies seldom worried whether they had money, hotel reservations or any of the other standard accoutrements of travel. Hippie households welcomed overnight guests on an impromptu basis, and the reciprocal nature of the lifestyle permitted greater freedom of movement. People generally cooperated to meet each other&#x27;s needs in ways that became less common after the early 1970s. This way of life is still seen among Rainbow Family groups, new age travellers and New Zealand&#x27;s housetruckers.

A derivative of this free-flow style of travel were the hippie trucks and buses, hand-crafted mobile houses built on a truck or bus chassis to facilitate a nomadic lifestyle, as documented in the 1974 book &quot;Roll Your Own&quot;. Some of these mobile houses were quite elaborate, with beds, toilets, showers and cooking facilities.

On the West Coast, a unique lifestyle developed around the Renaissance Faires that Phyllis and Ron Patterson first organized in 1963. During the summer and fall months, entire families traveled together in their trucks and buses, parked at Renaissance Pleasure Faire sites in Southern and Northern California, worked their crafts during the week, and donned Elizabethan costume for weekend performances, and attended booths where handmade goods were sold to the public. The sheer number of young people living at the time made for unprecedented travel opportunities to special happenings. The peak experience of this type was the Woodstock Festival near Bethel, New York, from August 15 to 18, 1969, which drew between 400,000 and 500,000 people.

====Hippie trail====

One travel experience, undertaken by hundreds of thousands of hippies between 1969 and 1971, was the Hippie trail overland route to India. Carrying little or no luggage, and with small amounts of cash, almost all followed the same route, hitch-hiking across Europe to Athens and on to Istanbul, then by train through central Turkey via Erzurum, continuing by bus into Iran, via Tabriz and Tehran to Mashhad, across the Afghan border into Herat, through southern Afghanistan via Kandahar to Kabul, over the Khyber Pass into Pakistan, via Rawalpindi and Lahore to the Indian frontier. Once in India, hippies went to many different destinations, but gathered in large numbers on the beaches of Goa and Kovalam in Trivandrum (Kerala), or crossed the border into Nepal to spend months in Kathmandu. In Kathmandu, most of the hippies hung out in the tranquil surroundings of a place called Freak Street (Nepal Bhasa: Jhoo Chhen), which still exists near Kathmandu Durbar Square.

===Spirituality and religion===

Many hippies rejected mainstream organized religion in favor of a more personal spiritual experience. Buddhism and Hinduism often resonated with hippies, as they were seen as less rule-bound, and less likely to be associated with existing baggage. Some hippies embraced neo-paganism, especially Wicca. Others were involved with the occult, with people like Timothy Leary citing Aleister Crowley as influences. By the 1960s, western interest in Hindu spirituality and yoga reached its peak, giving rise to a great number of Neo-Hindu schools specifically advocated to a western public.

In his 1991 book, &quot;Hippies and American Values&quot;, Timothy Miller described the hippie ethos as essentially a &quot;religious movement&quot; whose goal was to transcend the limitations of mainstream religious institutions. &quot;Like many dissenting religions, the hippies were enormously hostile to the religious institutions of the dominant culture, and they tried to find new and adequate ways to do the tasks the dominant religions failed to perform.&quot; In his seminal, contemporaneous work, &quot;The Hippie Trip&quot;, author Lewis Yablonsky notes that those who were most respected in hippie settings were the spiritual leaders, the so-called &quot;high priests&quot; who emerged during that era.
One such hippie &quot;high priest&quot; was San Francisco State University Professor Stephen Gaskin. Beginning in 1966, Gaskin&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Class&quot; eventually outgrew the lecture hall, and attracted 1,500 hippie followers in an open discussion of spiritual values, drawing from Christian, Buddhist, and Hindu teachings. In 1970 Gaskin founded a Tennessee community called The Farm, and even late in life he still listed his religion as &quot;Hippie.&quot;

Timothy Leary was an American psychologist and writer, known for his advocacy of psychedelic drugs. On September 19, 1966, Leary founded the League for Spiritual Discovery, a religion declaring LSD as its holy sacrament, in part as an unsuccessful attempt to maintain legal status for the use of LSD and other psychedelics for the religion&#x27;s adherents based on a &quot;freedom of religion&quot; argument. &quot;The Psychedelic Experience&quot; was the inspiration for John Lennon&#x27;s song &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; in the Beatles&#x27; album &quot;Revolver&quot;. Leary published a pamphlet in 1967 called &quot;Start Your Own Religion&quot; to encourage just that and was invited to attend the January 14, 1967 Human Be-In, a gathering of 20,000 to 30,000 hippies in San Francisco&#x27;s Golden Gate Park. In speaking to the group, he coined the famous phrase &quot;Turn on, tune in, drop out&quot;.

The English magician Aleister Crowley became an influential icon to the new alternative spiritual movements of the decade as well as for rock musicians. The Beatles included him as one of the many figures on the cover sleeve of their 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, while Jimmy Page, the guitarist of the Yardbirds and co-founder of 1970s rock band Led Zeppelin, was fascinated by Crowley, and owned some of his clothing, manuscripts and ritual objects, and during the 1970s bought Boleskine House, which appears in the band&#x27;s 1976 film &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot;. On the back cover of the Doors 1970 compilation album &quot;13&quot;, Jim Morrison and the other members of the Doors are shown posing with a bust of Aleister Crowley. Timothy Leary also openly acknowledged Crowley&#x27;s inspiration.

After the hippie era, the Dudeist philosophy and lifestyle developed. Inspired by &quot;the Dude&quot;, the neo-hippie protagonist of the Coen Brothers&#x27; 1998 film &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;, Dudeism&#x27;s stated primary objective is to promote a modern form of Chinese Taoism, outlined in &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; by Laozi (6th century BC), blended with concepts by the Ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus (341–270 BC), and presented in a style as personified by the character of Jeffrey &quot;the Dude&quot; Lebowski, a fictional hippie character portrayed by Jeff Bridges in the film. Dudeism has sometimes been regarded as a mock religion, though its founder and many adherents regard it seriously.

===Politics===

For the historian of the anarchist movement Ronald Creagh, the hippie movement could be considered as the last spectacular resurgence of utopian socialism. For Creagh, a characteristic of this is the desire for the transformation of society not through political revolution, or through reformist action pushed forward by the state, but through the creation of a counter-society of a socialist character in the midst of the current system, which will be made up of ideal communities of a more or less libertarian social form.

The peace symbol was developed in the UK as a logo for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and was embraced by U.S. anti-war protesters during the 1960s. Hippies were often pacifists, and participated in nonviolent political demonstrations, such as Civil Rights Movement, the marches on Washington, D.C., and anti–Vietnam War demonstrations, including draft-card burnings and the 1968 Democratic National Convention protests. The degree of political involvement varied widely among hippies, from those who were active in peace demonstrations, to the more anti-authority street theater and demonstrations of the Yippies, the most politically active hippie sub-group. Bobby Seale discussed the differences between Yippies and hippies with Jerry Rubin, who told him that Yippies were the political wing of the hippie movement, as hippies have not &quot;necessarily become political yet&quot;. Regarding the political activity of hippies, Rubin said, &quot;They mostly prefer to be stoned, but most of them want peace, and they want an end to this stuff.&quot;

In addition to nonviolent political demonstrations, hippie opposition to the Vietnam War included organizing political action groups to oppose the war, refusal to serve in the military and conducting &quot;teach-ins&quot; on college campuses that covered Vietnamese history and the larger political context of the war.

Scott McKenzie&#x27;s 1967 rendition of John Phillips&#x27; song &quot;San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)&quot;, which helped to inspire the hippie Summer of Love, became a homecoming song for all Vietnam veterans arriving in San Francisco from 1967 onward. McKenzie has dedicated every American performance of &quot;San Francisco&quot; to Vietnam veterans, and he sang in 2002 at the 20th anniversary of the dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Hippie political expression often took the form of &quot;dropping out&quot; of society to implement the changes they sought.
Politically motivated movements aided by hippies include the back to the land movement of the 1960s, cooperative business enterprises, alternative energy, the free press movement, and organic farming.

The San Francisco group known as the Diggers articulated an influential radical criticism of contemporary mass consumer society, and so they opened free stores which simply gave away their stock, provided free food, distributed free drugs, gave away money, organized free music concerts, and performed works of political art. The Diggers took their name from the original English Diggers (1649–50) led by Gerrard Winstanley, and they sought to create a mini-society free of money and capitalism.

Such activism was ideally carried through anti-authoritarian and non-violent means; thus it was observed that &quot;The way of the hippie is antithetical to all repressive hierarchical power structures since they are adverse to the hippie goals of peace, love and freedom... Hippies don&#x27;t impose their beliefs on others. Instead, hippies seek to change the world through reason and by living what they believe.&quot;

The political ideals of hippies influenced other movements, such as anarcho-punk, rave culture, green politics, stoner culture and the New Age movement. Arguments can be made that being &quot;woke&quot; is only the latest natural offshoot of hipness, since both seek heightened &quot;awareness&quot; of one&#x27;s surroundings (social, political, sexual etc.). For example, John Leland elaborates on the origins of coded language from African American slaves as a type of aware hipness and documents connections to downtrodden Jews and other minorities in American society in &quot;Hip: The History&quot;.
Penny Rimbaud of the English anarcho-punk band Crass said in interviews, and in an essay called &quot;The Last of the Hippies&quot;, that Crass was formed in memory of his friend Wally Hope. Crass had its roots in Dial House, which was established in 1967 as a commune. Some punks were often critical of Crass for their involvement in the hippie movement. Like Crass, Jello Biafra was influenced by the hippie movement, and cited the yippies as a key influence on his political activism and thinking, though he also wrote songs critical of hippies.

===Drugs===
Following in the footsteps of the Beats, many hippies used cannabis (marijuana), considering it pleasurable and benign. They used drugs such as marijuana, LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, or magic mushrooms, and mescaline (peyote) to gain spiritual awakening.

On the East Coast of the United States, Harvard University professors Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner and Richard Alpert (Ram Dass) advocated psychotropic drugs for psychotherapy, self-exploration, religious and spiritual use. Regarding LSD, Leary said, &quot;Expand your consciousness and find ecstasy and revelation within.&quot;

On the West Coast of the United States, Ken Kesey was an important figure in promoting the recreational use of psychotropic drugs, especially LSD, also known as &quot;acid.&quot; By holding what he called &quot;Acid Tests&quot;, and touring the country with his band of Merry Pranksters, Kesey became a magnet for media attention that drew many young people to the fledgling movement. The Grateful Dead (originally billed as the Warlocks) played some of their first shows at the Acid Tests, often as high on LSD as their audiences. Kesey and the Pranksters had a &quot;vision of turning on the world.&quot; Harder drugs, such as cocaine, amphetamines and heroin, were also sometimes used in hippie settings; however, these drugs were often disdained, even among those who used them, because they were recognized as harmful and addictive.

==Legacy==
===Culture===

The legacy of the hippie movement continues to permeate Western society. In general, unmarried couples of all ages feel free to travel and live together without societal disapproval. Frankness regarding sexual matters has become more common, and the rights of homosexual, bisexual and transgender people, as well as people who choose not to categorize themselves at all, have expanded. Religious and cultural diversity has gained greater acceptance.

Co-operative business enterprises and creative community living arrangements are more accepted than before. Some of the little hippie health food stores of the 1960s and 1970s are now large-scale, profitable businesses, due to greater interest in natural foods, herbal remedies, vitamins and other nutritional supplements.
It has been suggested that 1960s and 1970s counterculture embraced certain types of &quot;groovy&quot; science and technology. Examples include surfboard design, renewable energy, aquaculture and client-centered approaches to midwifery, childbirth, and women&#x27;s health.
Authors Stewart Brand and John Markoff argue that the development and popularization of personal computers and the Internet find one of their primary roots in the anti-authoritarian ethos promoted by hippie culture.

Distinct appearance and clothing was one of the immediate legacies of hippies worldwide. During the 1960s and 1970s, mustaches, beards and long hair became more commonplace and colorful, while multi-ethnic clothing dominated the fashion world. Since that time, a wide range of personal appearance options and clothing styles, including nudity, have become more widely acceptable, all of which was uncommon before the hippie era. Hippies also inspired the decline in popularity of the necktie and other business clothing, which had been unavoidable for men during the 1950s and early 1960s. Additionally, hippie fashion itself has been commonplace in the years since the 1960s in clothing and accessories, particularly the peace symbol. Astrology, including everything from serious study to whimsical amusement regarding personal traits, was integral to hippie culture. The generation of the 1970s became influenced by the hippie and the 1960s countercultural legacy. As such in New York City musicians and audiences from the female, homosexual, Black, and Latino communities adopted several traits from the hippies and psychedelia. They included overpowering sound, free-form dancing, multi-colored, pulsating lighting, colorful costumes, and hallucinogens. 1960s Psychedelic soul groups like the Chambers Brothers and especially Sly and the Family Stone influenced George Clinton, P-funk and the Temptations. In addition, the perceived positivity, lack of irony, and earnestness of the hippies informed proto-disco music like M.F.S.B.&#x27;s album &quot;Love Is the Message&quot;. Disco music supported the &#x27;70s LGBT movement.

The hippie legacy in literature includes the lasting popularity of books reflecting the hippie experience, such as &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot;.

===Music===
In music, the folk rock and psychedelic rock popular among hippies evolved into genres such as acid rock, world beat and heavy metal music. Psychedelic trance (also known as psytrance) is a type of electronic music influenced by 1960s psychedelic rock. The tradition of hippie music festivals began in the United States in 1965 with Ken Kesey&#x27;s Acid Tests, where the Grateful Dead played tripping on LSD and initiated psychedelic jamming. For the next several decades, many hippies and neo-hippies became part of the Deadhead community, attending music and art festivals held around the country. The Grateful Dead toured continuously, with few interruptions between 1965 and 1995. Phish and their fans (called &quot;Phish Heads&quot;) operated in the same manner, with the band touring continuously between 1983 and 2004. Many contemporary bands performing at hippie festivals and their derivatives are called jam bands, since they play songs that contain long instrumentals similar to the original hippie bands of the 1960s.

With the demise of Grateful Dead and Phish, nomadic touring hippies attend a growing series of summer festivals, the largest of which is called the Bonnaroo Music &amp; Arts Festival, which premiered in 2002. The Oregon Country Fair is a three-day festival featuring handmade crafts, educational displays and costumed entertainment. The annual Starwood Festival, founded in 1981, is a seven-day event indicative of the spiritual quest of hippies through an exploration of non-mainstream religions and world-views, and has offered performances and classes by a variety of hippie and counter-culture icons.

The Burning Man festival began in 1986 at a San Francisco beach party and is now held in the Black Rock Desert northeast of Reno, Nevada. Although few participants would accept the &quot;hippie&quot; label, Burning Man is a contemporary expression of alternative community in the same spirit as early hippie events. The gathering becomes a temporary city (36,500 occupants in 2005, 50,000+ in 2011), with elaborate encampments, displays, and many art cars. Other events that enjoy a large attendance include the Rainbow Family Gatherings, the Gathering of the Vibes, Community Peace Festivals, and the Woodstock Festivals.

===United Kingdom===

In the UK, there are many new age travellers who are known as hippies to outsiders, but prefer to call themselves the Peace Convoy. They started the Stonehenge Free Festival in 1974, but English Heritage later banned the festival in 1985, resulting in the Battle of the Beanfield. With Stonehenge banned as a festival site, new age travellers gather at the annual Glastonbury Festival. Today, hippies in the UK can be found in parts of South West England, such as Bristol (particularly the neighborhoods of Montpelier, Stokes Croft, St Werburghs, Bishopston, Easton and Totterdown), Glastonbury in Somerset, Totnes in Devon, and Stroud in Gloucestershire, as well as in Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire, and in areas of London and Cornwall. In the summer, many hippies and those of similar subcultures gather at numerous outdoor festivals in the countryside.

In New Zealand, between 1976 and 1981, tens of thousands of hippies gathered from around the world on large farms around Waihi and Waikino for music and alternatives festivals. Named &quot;Nambassa&quot;, the festivals focused on peace, love, and a balanced lifestyle. The events featured practical workshops and displays advocating alternative lifestyles, self sufficiency, clean and sustainable energy and sustainable living.

In the UK and Europe, the years 1987 until 1989 were marked by a large-scale revival of many characteristics of the hippie movement. This later movement, composed mostly of people aged 18 to 25, adopted much of the original hippie philosophy of love, peace and freedom. The summer of 1988 became known as the Second Summer of Love. Although the music favored by this movement was modern electronic music, especially house music and acid house, one could often hear songs from the original hippie era in the &quot;chill out rooms&quot; at raves. Also, there was a trend towards psychedelic indie rock in the form of shoegaze, dream pop, Madchester and neo-psychedelic bands like Jesus And Mary Chain, the Sundays, Spacemen 3, Loop, Stone Roses, Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets and Ride. This was effectively a parallel soundtrack to the rave scene that was rooted as much in 1960s psychedelic rock as it was in post-punk, though Madchester was more directly influenced by acid house, funk and northern soul. Many ravers were originally soul boys and football casuals, and football hooliganism declined after the Second Summer of Love.

In the UK, many of the well-known figures of this movement first lived communally in Stroud Green, an area of north London located in Finsbury Park. In 1995, &quot;The Sekhmet Hypothesis&quot; attempted to link both hippie and rave culture together in relation to transactional analysis, suggesting that rave culture was a social archetype based on the mood of friendly strength, compared to the gentle hippie archetype, based on friendly weakness. The later electronic dance genres known as goa trance and psychedelic trance and its related events and culture have important hippie legacies and neo hippie elements. The popular DJ of the genre Goa Gil, like other hippies from the 1960s, left the US and Western Europe to travel on the hippie trail and later developed psychedelic parties and music in the Indian state of Goa, in which the goa and psytrance genres were born and exported around the world in the 1990s and 2000s.

===Media===
Popular films depicting the hippie ethos and lifestyle include &quot;Woodstock&quot;, &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, &quot;Hair&quot;, &quot;The Doors&quot;, &quot;Across the Universe&quot;, &quot;Taking Woodstock&quot;, and &quot;Crumb&quot;.

In 2002, photojournalist John Bassett McCleary published a 650-page, 6,000-entry unabridged slang dictionary devoted to the language of the hippies titled &quot;The Hippie Dictionary: A Cultural Encyclopedia of the 1960s and 1970s&quot;. The book was revised and expanded to 700 pages in 2004. McCleary believes that the hippie counterculture added a significant number of words to the English language by borrowing from the lexicon of the Beat Generation, through the hippies&#x27; shortening of beatnik words and then popularizing their usage.

<text>Reproducibility, closely related to replicability and repeatability, is a major principle underpinning the scientific method. For the findings of a study to be reproducible means that results obtained by an experiment or an observational study or in a statistical analysis of a data set should be achieved again with a high degree of reliability when the study is replicated. There are different kinds of replication but typically replication studies involve different researchers using the same methodology. Only after one or several such successful replications should a result be recognized as scientific knowledge.

== Types of Reproducibility ==
There are different kinds of replication studies, each serving a unique role in scientific validation:

Direct Replication – The exact experiment or study is repeated under the same conditions to verify the original findings.

Conceptual Replication – A study tests the same hypothesis but uses a different methodology, materials, or population to see if the results hold in different contexts.

Computational Reproducibility – In data science and computational research, reproducibility requires making all datasets, code, and algorithms openly available so others can replicate the analysis and obtain the same results.

== Importance of Reproducibility ==
Reproducibility serves several critical purposes in science:

Verification of Results – Confirms that findings are not due to random chance or errors.

Building Trust in Research – Scientists, policymakers, and the public rely on reproducible studies to make informed decisions.
Advancing Knowledge – Establishes a strong foundation for future research by validating existing theories.

Avoiding Bias and Fraud – Helps detect false positives, publication bias, and data manipulation that could mislead the scientific community.
Challenges in Achieving Reproducibility

Despite its importance, many studies fail reproducibility tests, leading to what is known as the replication crisis in fields like psychology, medicine, and social sciences. Some key challenges include:

Insufficient Data Sharing – Many researchers do not make raw data, code, or methodology openly available, making replication difficult.
Small Sample Sizes – Studies with limited sample sizes may show results that do not generalize to larger populations.

Publication Bias – Journals tend to publish positive findings rather than null or negative results, leading to an incomplete scientific record.
Complex Experimental Conditions – In some cases, small variations in laboratory settings, equipment, or researcher expertise can affect outcomes, making exact replication difficult.

== Real-World Applications of Reproducibility ==
Medical Research – Reproducibility ensures that clinical trials and drug effectiveness studies produce reliable results before treatments reach the public.

AI and Machine Learning – Scientists emphasize reproducibility in AI by requiring open-source models and datasets to validate algorithm performance.

Climate Science – Climate models must be reproducible across different datasets and simulations to ensure accurate predictions of global warming.

Pharmaceutical Development – Drug discovery relies on reproducing experiments across multiple labs to ensure safety and efficacy.

== Improving Reproducibility in Science ==
To enhance reproducibility, researchers and institutions can adopt several best practices:

Open Data and Code – Making datasets and computational methods publicly available ensures that others can verify results.

Registered Reports – Some scientific journals now accept studies based on pre-registered research plans, reducing bias.

Standardized Methods – Using well-documented, standardized experimental protocols helps ensure consistent results.

Independent Replication Studies – Funding agencies and journals should prioritize replication studies to strengthen scientific integrity.

With a narrower scope, &quot;reproducibility&quot; has been defined in computational sciences as having the following quality: the results should be documented by making all data and code available in such a way that the computations can be executed again with identical results.

In recent decades, there has been a rising concern that many published scientific results fail the test of reproducibility, evoking a reproducibility or replication crisis.

==History==

The first to stress the importance of reproducibility in science was the Anglo-Irish chemist Robert Boyle, in England in the 17th century. Boyle&#x27;s air pump was designed to generate and study vacuum, which at the time was a very controversial concept. Indeed, distinguished philosophers such as René Descartes and Thomas Hobbes denied the very possibility of vacuum existence. Historians of science Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer, in their 1985 book &quot;Leviathan and the Air-Pump&quot;, describe the debate between Boyle and Hobbes, ostensibly over the nature of vacuum, as fundamentally an argument about how useful knowledge should be gained. Boyle, a pioneer of the experimental method, maintained that the foundations of knowledge should be constituted by experimentally produced facts, which can be made believable to a scientific community by their reproducibility. By repeating the same experiment over and over again, Boyle argued, the certainty of fact will emerge.

The air pump, which in the 17th century was a complicated and expensive apparatus to build, also led to one of the first documented disputes over the reproducibility of a particular scientific phenomenon. In the 1660s, the Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens built his own air pump in Amsterdam, the first one outside the direct management of Boyle and his assistant at the time Robert Hooke. Huygens reported an effect he termed &quot;anomalous suspension&quot;, in which water appeared to levitate in a glass jar inside his air pump (in fact suspended over an air bubble), but Boyle and Hooke could not replicate this phenomenon in their own pumps. As Shapin and Schaffer describe, &quot;it became clear that unless the phenomenon could be produced in England with one of the two pumps available, then no one in England would accept the claims Huygens had made, or his competence in working the pump&quot;. Huygens was finally invited to England in 1663, and under his personal guidance Hooke was able to replicate anomalous suspension of water. Following this Huygens was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society. However, Shapin and Schaffer also note that &quot;the accomplishment of replication was dependent on contingent acts of judgment. One cannot write down a formula saying when replication was or was not achieved&quot;.

The philosopher of science Karl Popper noted briefly in his famous 1934 book &quot;The Logic of Scientific Discovery&quot; that &quot;non-reproducible single occurrences are of no significance to science&quot;. The statistician Ronald Fisher wrote in his 1935 book &quot;The Design of Experiments&quot;, which set the foundations for the modern scientific practice of hypothesis testing and statistical significance, that &quot;we may say that a phenomenon is experimentally demonstrable when we know how to conduct an experiment which will rarely fail to give us statistically significant results&quot;. Such assertions express a common dogma in modern science that reproducibility is a necessary condition (although not necessarily sufficient) for establishing a scientific fact, and in practice for establishing scientific authority in any field of knowledge. However, as noted above by Shapin and Schaffer, this dogma is not well-formulated quantitatively, such as statistical significance for instance, and therefore it is not explicitly established how many times must a fact be replicated to be considered reproducible.

==Terminology==
&quot;Replicability&quot; and &quot;repeatability&quot; are related terms broadly or loosely synonymous with reproducibility (for example, among the general public), but they are often usefully differentiated in more precise senses, as follows.

Two major steps are naturally distinguished in connection with reproducibility of experimental or observational studies:
When new data is obtained in the attempt to achieve it, the term &quot;replicability&quot; is often used, and the new study is a &quot;replication&quot; or &quot;replicate&quot; of the original one. Obtaining the same results when analyzing the data set of the original study again with the same procedures, many authors use the term &quot;reproducibility&quot; in a narrow, technical sense coming from its use in computational research.
&quot;Repeatability&quot; is related to the &quot;repetition&quot; of the experiment within the same study by the same researchers.
Reproducibility in the original, wide sense is only acknowledged if a replication performed by an &quot;independent researcher team&quot; is successful.

The terms reproducibility and replicability sometimes appear even in the scientific literature with reversed meaning, as different research fields settled on their own definitions for the same terms.

==Measures of reproducibility and repeatability==
In chemistry, the terms reproducibility and repeatability are used with a specific quantitative meaning. In inter-laboratory experiments, a concentration or other quantity of a chemical substance is measured repeatedly in different laboratories to assess the variability of the measurements. Then, the standard deviation of the difference between two values obtained within the same laboratory is called repeatability. The standard deviation for the difference between two measurement from different laboratories is called &quot;reproducibility&quot;.
These measures are related to the more general concept of variance components in metrology.

==Reproducible research==

===Reproducible research method===
The term &quot;reproducible research&quot; refers to the idea that scientific results should be documented in such a way that their deduction is fully transparent. This requires a detailed description of the methods used to obtain the data
and making the full dataset and the code to calculate the results easily accessible.
This is the essential part of open science.

To make any research project computationally reproducible, general practice involves all data and files being clearly separated, labelled, and documented. All operations should be fully documented and automated as much as practicable, avoiding manual intervention where feasible. The workflow should be designed as a sequence of smaller steps that are combined so that the intermediate outputs from one step directly feed as inputs into the next step. Version control should be used as it lets the history of the project be easily reviewed and allows for the documenting and tracking of changes in a transparent manner.

A basic workflow for reproducible research involves data acquisition, data processing and data analysis. Data acquisition primarily consists of obtaining primary data from a primary source such as surveys, field observations, experimental research, or obtaining data from an existing source. Data processing involves the processing and review of the raw data collected in the first stage, and includes data entry, data manipulation and filtering and may be done using software. The data should be digitized and prepared for data analysis. Data may be analysed with the use of software to interpret or visualise statistics or data to produce the desired results of the research such as quantitative results including figures and tables. The use of software and automation enhances the reproducibility of research methods.

There are systems that facilitate such documentation, like the R Markdown language
or the Jupyter notebook.
The Open Science Framework provides a platform and useful tools to support reproducible research.

===Reproducible research in practice===
Psychology has seen a renewal of internal concerns about irreproducible results (see the entry on replicability crisis for empirical results on success rates of replications). Researchers showed in a 2006 study that, of 141 authors of a publication from the American Psychological Association (APA) empirical articles, 103 (73%) did not respond with their data over a six-month period. In a follow-up study published in 2015, it was found that 246 out of 394 contacted authors of papers in APA journals did not share their data upon request (62%). In a 2012 paper, it was suggested that researchers should publish data along with their works, and a dataset was released alongside as a demonstration. In 2017, an article published in &quot;Scientific Data&quot; suggested that this may not be sufficient and that the whole analysis context should be disclosed.

In economics, concerns have been raised in relation to the credibility and reliability of published research. In other sciences, reproducibility is regarded as fundamental and is often a prerequisite to research being published, however in economic sciences it is not seen as a priority of the greatest importance. Most peer-reviewed economic journals do not take any substantive measures to ensure that published results are reproducible, however, the top economics journals have been moving to adopt mandatory data and code archives. There is low or no incentives for researchers to share their data, and authors would have to bear the costs of compiling data into reusable forms. Economic research is often not reproducible as only a portion of journals have adequate disclosure policies for datasets and program code, and even if they do, authors frequently do not comply with them or they are not enforced by the publisher. A Study of 599 articles published in 37 peer-reviewed journals revealed that while some journals have achieved significant compliance rates, significant portion have only partially complied, or not complied at all. On an article level, the average compliance rate was 47.5%; and on a journal level, the average compliance rate was 38%, ranging from 13% to 99%.

A 2018 study published in the journal &quot;PLOS ONE&quot; found that 14.4% of a sample of public health statistics researchers had shared their data or code or both.

There have been initiatives to improve reporting and hence reproducibility in the medical literature for many years, beginning with the CONSORT initiative, which is now part of a wider initiative, the EQUATOR Network.
This group has recently turned its attention to how better reporting might reduce waste in research, especially biomedical research.

Reproducible research is key to new discoveries in pharmacology. A Phase I discovery will be followed by Phase II reproductions as a drug develops towards commercial production. In recent decades Phase II success has fallen from 28% to 18%. A 2011 study found that 65% of medical studies were inconsistent when re-tested, and only 6% were completely reproducible.

==Noteworthy irreproducible results==
Hideyo Noguchi became famous for correctly identifying the bacterial agent of syphilis, but also claimed that he could culture this agent in his laboratory. Nobody else has been able to produce this latter result.

In March 1989, University of Utah chemists Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann reported the production of excess heat that could only be explained by a nuclear process (&quot;cold fusion&quot;). The report was astounding given the simplicity of the equipment: it was essentially an electrolysis cell containing heavy water and a palladium cathode which rapidly absorbed the deuterium produced during electrolysis. The news media reported on the experiments widely, and it was a front-page item on many newspapers around the world (see science by press conference). Over the next several months others tried to replicate the experiment, but were unsuccessful.

Nikola Tesla claimed as early as 1899 to have used a high frequency current to light gas-filled lamps from over away without using wires. In 1904 he built Wardenclyffe Tower on Long Island to demonstrate means to send and receive power without connecting wires. The facility was never fully operational and was not completed due to economic problems, so no attempt to reproduce his first result was ever carried out.

Other examples which contrary evidence has refuted the original claim:
* N-rays, a hypothesized form of radiation subsequently found to be illusory
* Polywater, a hypothesized polymerized form of water found to be just water with common contaminations
* Stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency, revealed to be the result of fraud
* GFAJ-1, a bacterium that could purportedly incorporate arsenic into its DNA in place of phosphorus
* MMR vaccine controversy — a study in &quot;The Lancet&quot; claiming the MMR vaccine caused autism was revealed to be fraudulent
* Schön scandal — semiconductor &quot;breakthroughs&quot; revealed to be fraudulent
* Power posing — a social psychology phenomenon that went viral after being the subject of a very popular TED talk, but was unable to be replicated in dozens of studies

<text>A chess clock is a device that comprises two adjacent clocks with buttons to stop one clock while starting the other, so that the two clocks never run simultaneously. The clocks are used in games where the time is allocated between two parties. The purpose is to keep track of the total time each party takes and prevent delays. Parties may take more or less time over any individual move. 

Chess clocks were first used extensively in tournament chess, beginning with a competition at the London 1883 tournament. They are often called game clocks, as their use has since spread to tournament Scrabble, shogi, Go, and nearly every competitive two-player board game, as well as other types of games. Various designs exist for chess clocks and different methods of time control may be employed on the clocks, with &quot;sudden death&quot; being the simplest.

== Description ==
A chess clock consists of two adjacent clocks with buttons to stop one clock while starting the other, so that the two clocks never run simultaneously. The devices are used in chess and other two-player games where the players move in turn. The purpose is to keep track of the total time each player takes for their own moves, and ensure that neither player overly delays the game.

Invented by Thomas Bright Wilson of Manchester Chess Club, the clocks were first used during competition at the London 1883 tournament. Chess clocks were first used extensively in tournament chess, and are often called &quot;game clocks&quot;. Their use has since spread to tournament Scrabble, shogi, Go, and nearly every competitive two-player board game, as well as other types of games. They have also been used in some legal settings where each side or party is allotted a specific amount of time for arguments.

== Designs ==

=== Analog game clocks ===
Analog clocks are equipped with a &quot;flag&quot; that falls to indicate the exact moment the player&#x27;s time has expired. Analog clocks use mechanical buttons. Pressing the button on one player&#x27;s side physically stops the movement of that player&#x27;s clock and releases the hold on the opponent&#x27;s.

The drawbacks of the mechanical clocks include accuracy and matching of the two clocks, and matching of the indicators (flags) of time expiration. Additional time cannot easily be added for more complex time controls, especially those that call for an increment or delay on every move, such as some forms of byoyomi.

=== Early development of digital game clocks ===

In 1973, to address the issues with analog clocks, Bruce Cheney, a Cornell University electrical engineering (EE) student and chess player, created the first digital chess clock as a project for an undergraduate EE course. Typical of most inventions, it was crude compared to the products on the market many years later and was limited by the technology that existed at the time. For example, the display was implemented via red LEDs, which required significant power and, as a result, the clock had to be plugged into a wall outlet. The high cost of LEDs at the time meant that only one set of digits could be displayed: that of the player whose turn it was to move. This meant that each player&#x27;s time had to be multiplexed to the display when their time was running. In 1973, LSI chips were not readily or cheaply available, so all the multiplexing and logic was enabled using chips consisting of four two-input TTL NAND gates, resulting in excessive power consumption. Being plugged into the wall is obviously a major drawback, but had one advantage: the timebase for the clock was driven off a rectified version of the alternating current mains frequency. Each player had a separate counter and, in a parallel to the original mechanical architecture, one player&#x27;s counter was disabled while the other&#x27;s was running. The clock only had one mode: time ran forward. It could be reset, but not set. It did not count the number of moves. But it successfully addressed the original goals of the project (accurate and matched timing).

The first commercially available digital chess clock was patented in 1975 by Joseph Meshi and Jeffrey R. Ponsor. They named it the Micromate-80. There was only one made and this was tested by chess players in multiple tournaments. Three years later a much-improved Micromate-180 was produced alongside Meshi&#x27;s MBA thesis, &quot;Demand Analysis for a New Product (The Digital Chess Clock)&quot;, at San Diego State University, while Meshi and Ponsor continued to develop digital gaming.

=== Fischer clock and related designs ===

Digital clocks and Internet gaming have spurred a wave of experimentation with more varied and complex time controls than the traditional standards. Time control is commonly used in modern chess in many different methodologies. One particularly notable development, which has gained quite wide acceptance in chess, was proposed by former world champion Bobby Fischer, who in 1988 filed for US patent 4,884,255 (awarded in 1989) for a new type of digital chess clock. Fischer&#x27;s digital clock gave each player a fixed period of time at the start of the game and then added a small amount after each move. Joseph Meshi called this &quot;Accumulation&quot; as it was a main feature of his patented Micromate-180 (US Patent 4,247,925 1978). This became the linchpin of Fischer&#x27;s clock patented ten years later. In this way, the players would never be desperately short of time. This timing method is occasionally called &quot;accumulation&quot; but it is usually called &quot;increment&quot;, &quot;bonus&quot;, or &quot;Fischer&quot;.

The increment time control was first used in the privately organised 1992 Fischer–Spassky match, and quickly became popular in the wider chess world, being subsequently used in the FIDE World Chess Championship 1998. Nowadays most top level tournaments and tournaments outside the United States use Fischer&#x27;s system. An increasing number of lower level tournaments in the US are also starting to use Fischer&#x27;s system. Other aspects of Fischer&#x27;s patent, such as a synthesized voice announcing how much time the players have, thus eliminating the need for them to keep looking at the clock, have not been adopted.

On March 10, 1994, a patent application was filed by inventors Frank A. Camaratta Jr. of Huntsville, Alabama, and William Goichberg of Salisbury Mills, New York, for a game timer especially suitable for playing the game of chess, which employed a (simple) &quot;delay&quot; feature. The game timer provides, among other features, a user-definable delay between the time the activation button is pressed and the time that the activated clock actually begins to count down. United States Patent 5,420,830 was issued on May 10, 1995, and subsequently assigned to the United States Chess Federation by the inventors. As with the Fischer clock, the benefit of the delay clock is to reduce the likelihood that a player with positional or material superiority will lose a match solely because of the expiration of time on that player&#x27;s time clock. In the United States, delay is still widely used, but increment is becoming more popular.

==Timing methods==

Sudden death: The simplest time control is &quot;sudden death&quot;, in which players must make a predetermined number of moves in a certain amount of time or forfeit the game immediately. A particularly popular variant is blitz chess, in which each player is given a short time, such as five minutes, on the clock in which to play the entire game.

Increment (also known as Bonus and Fischer since former World Chess Champion Bobby Fischer patented this timing method): a specified amount of time is added to the player&#x27;s main time each move, unless the player&#x27;s main time ran out before they completed their move. For example, if the time control is 90+30 (ninety minutes of main time per player with a thirty-second increment each move), each player gets an additional thirty seconds added to their main time for each move, unless the player&#x27;s main time ran out first. Under FIDE and US Chess rules, the increment is applied to the first move as well. For example, for 3+2 each player starts with three minutes and two seconds on the first move. Not all digital clocks automatically give the increment for move one and thus for those that don&#x27;t, the increment time has to be added manually to the main time so each player gets the increment for move one. In online chess, players may make multiple premoves (such as moving a knight back and forth) to give them additional time to think and/or avoid running out of time.

Bronstein delay (named after Grandmaster David Bronstein who invented this timing method): this timing method adds time but, unlike Increment, the maximum amount of time is not always added. If a player expends more than the specified delay then the entire delay is added to the player&#x27;s clock, but if a player moves faster than the delay, only the exact amount of time expended by the player is added. For example, if the delay is ten seconds and a player uses ten or more seconds for a move, ten seconds is added after they complete their move. If the player uses five seconds for a move, five seconds is added after they complete their move. This ensures that the main time left on the clock can never increase even if a player makes fast moves. As with Increment, the delay time is applied to the first move under FIDE and US Chess rules.

Simple delay (also known as US delay): with this timing method, the clock waits for the delay period each move before the player&#x27;s main time starts counting down. For example, if the delay is ten seconds, the clock waits for ten seconds each move before the main time starts counting down.

Bronstein delay and Simple delay are very similar, but not equal. Mathematically, Bronstein delay and Simple delay are identical; the amount of time allotted to each player is equivalent at all stages of the game. For this reason, the two delays are interchangeable in the FIDE laws of chess. In practice, however, Bronstein delay and Simple delay display time differently. In Bronstein delay, the amount of time is added &quot;after&quot; the move has been made; this distinction may be crucial when a player is running out of time. 

The advantage of Bronstein delay is that a player can always quickly see exactly how much time they have for their next move without having to mentally add the main and delay time. The advantage of Simple delay is that a player can always tell whether the time that is counting down is the delay time or the main time. For example, in a game with a 5-second delay, when a player presses their clock with 1-second remaining, the clock will display with 1-second remaining, and the 5-second delay is counted separately on their next turn. In Bronstein, the 5-seconds are immediately added, and the clock will display 6-seconds. Simple delay is the form of delay most often used in the US, while Bronstein delay is the form of delay most often used in most other countries.

== Strategy ==
The players may take more or less time over any individual move. The opening moves in chess are often played quickly due to their familiarity, which leaves the players more time to consider more complex and unfamiliar positions later. It is not unusual in slow chess games for a player to leave the table, but the clock of the absent player continues to run if it is their turn, or starts to run if their opponent makes a move.

<text>JSC Kamov () is a rotorcraft manufacturing company based in Lyubertsy, Russia.

The Kamov Design Bureau (design office prefix Ka) has more recently specialised in compact helicopters with coaxial rotors, suitable for naval service and high-speed operations.

==History==
Kamov was founded by Nikolai Ilyich Kamov, who started building his first rotary-winged aircraft in 1929, together with N. K. Skrzhinskii. Up to 1940, the year of Kamov plant establishment, they created many autogyros, including the TsAGI A-7-3, the only armed autogyro to see (limited) combat action.

From 2002 AFK Sistema controlled a 51% stake in the company, with MiG controlling the remaining 49%. Kamov was sold to Oboronprom in 2005.

Kamov merged with Mil and Rostvertol to form Russian Helicopters. The Kamov brand name was retained, though the new company dropped overlapping product lines.

<doc id="47658" wikidata="Q650639" url="?curid=47658" title="Aérospatiale">
<text>Aérospatiale () was a major French state-owned aerospace and defence corporation. It was founded in 1970 as  () through the merger of three established state-owned companies: Sud Aviation, Nord Aviation and SEREB. The company was headquartered in the 16th arrondissement of Paris. 

During its existence, Aérospatiale was one of the world’s largest aerospace companies. It was Europe&#x27;s biggest general aeronautics manufacturer and its leading exporter in the industry. Its activities covered civilian and military airplanes and helicopters; launch vehicles and spacecraft; as well both strategic and tactical weapon systems, from intercontinental ballistic missiles to man-portable anti-tank guided missile systems. The company was also prominently involved in many high-profile multinational programmes such as the Concorde supersonic airliner, the Ariane series of launch vehicles, and the Airbus A300, the world&#x27;s first twin-engined widebody airliner.

As a consequence of the peace dividend following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, much of the European aerospace and defence industry began to consolidate, with Aérospatiale&#x27;s break-up accelerated by the French government&#x27;s efforts to privatize many state-owned companies. In 1992, Aérospatiale and Germany&#x27;s DASA each spun off their helicopter businesses, which merged together to form the Eurocopter Group, with the two parent companies holding 70% and 30% ownership of the new entity respectively. Eurocopter would later be renamed Airbus Helicopters. In 1999, the Aérospatiale&#x27;s satellite manufacturing division was acquired by Alcatel to form Alcatel Space, later renamed Thales Alenia Space.

Aérospatiale&#x27;s remaining assets were merged with the aerospace, defence and telecommunications division of the French conglomerate Matra (&quot;Matra Hautes Technologies&quot;) to form Aérospatiale-Matra in July 2000. One year later, in 2001, Aérospatiale-Matra merged with DASA and Spain&#x27;s Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA) to form the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), later rebranded Airbus. The majority of Aérospatiale&#x27;s assets are thus now part of Airbus or its related joint ventures.

==History==
===Formation===

In 1970, &quot;Aérospatiale&quot; was created under the name Société Nationale Industrielle Aérospatiale as a result of the merger of several French state-owned companies - Sud Aviation, Nord Aviation and Société d&#x27;étude et de réalisation d&#x27;engins balistiques (SEREB). The newly formed entity was the largest aerospace company in France. From the onset, the French government owned a controlling stake in Aérospatiale; at one stage, a 97 per cent ownership of the company was held by the government.

In 1971, Aérospatiale was managed by the French industrialist Henri Ziegler; that same year, the firm&#x27;s North American marketing and sales arm, which had previously operated under the trading name of the &quot;French Aerospace Corporation&quot;, was officially rebranded as the &quot;European Aerospace Corporation&quot;, which was intended to better reflect Aérospatiale&#x27;s increasing focus on collaborative efforts with its European partners.

===Major activities===
Many of Aérospatiale&#x27;s initial programmes were holdovers from its predecessors, particularly those of Sud Aviation. Perhaps the most high-profile of these programmes was Concorde, a joint French-British attempt to develop and market a supersonic commercial airliner. Initial work on this project had begun at Sud Aviation and the Bristol Aeroplane Company, its British counterpart. The engines for Concorde were also developed as a joint Anglo-French effort between SNECMA and Bristol Siddeley. However, the programme was highly politicised and encountered considerable cost overruns and delays. Ultimately, it was negatively affected equally by bad political decisions and an oil crisis in the 1970s; thus, only two airlines purchased Concorde.

Aérospatiale&#x27;s senior management were keen to avoid the mistakes of the Concorde program. Their next major effort would be a transnational consortium with British Aerospace and the West German&#x27;s aircraft company Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm (MBB). The British would eventually withdraw from the discussions, but the French and West Germans would proceed and form Airbus Industrie GIE. It was established with the purpose of building a twin-engined widebody airliner, known as the A300. At first, it was difficult to achieve sales and the outlook for the A300 seemed negative. However, Aérospatiale continued to manufacture the airliner without orders, as it could not reasonably cut back production as French law required that laid-off employees were to receive 90 per cent of their pay for a year as well as to retain their health benefits throughout.

Sales of the A300 picked up and the type eventually became a major commercial success, subsequently driving both the American Lockheed L-1011 and the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 from the market due to its cheaper operating model. On the back of this success, further airliners would be produced under the Airbus brand and the company would become a world leader in the field of large commercial aircraft during the 1990s.

Aérospatiale played a leading role in the development of the European space sector. During the 1960s, Sud Aviation had been involved in a multinational European programme to produce the Europa space launch vehicle, this being a three-stage rocket with the separate stages being manufactured in Britain, France, and Germany respectively. However, all of the flight tests conducted were failures; the programme&#x27;s misfortune has been attributed to there being no central authority responsible for operations. This came as a result of the issue of workshare becoming highly politicized.

When Aérospatiale stepped in, in 1973, it was determined not to repeat the mistakes of Europa. The company proposed to build a new heavy launch vehicle, which would later be called the Ariane, to take the place of Europa. While other European nations were invited to participate, it would be French officials who would hold primary responsibility, and thus, make the most important decisions. This approach was agreed upon with several other nations; during 1979.

Ariane was an immediate success, allowing the French to gain a strong advantage over the United States, which had centred its efforts on the Space Shuttle. However, the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster during 1986 showed that it was too complex for routine use as a satellite launch platform. Aérospatiale went on to develop more capable versions of the Ariane, which took much of the business of space launches away from the Americans during the 1990s.

===Privatisation and mergers===
In 1992, Aérospatiale and the German defense company DaimlerBenz Aerospace AG (DASA) combined their respective helicopter divisions together to form the Eurocopter Group; ownership of this new entity was shared (70% and 30% respectively) between the two parent companies.

During the late 1990s, French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin&#x27;s Plural Left government initiated a policy towards the privatization of Aérospatiale. In 1999, the majority of Aérospatiale, except for the satellites activities, merged with French conglomerate Matra&#x27;s defense wing, Matra Haute Technologie, to form Aérospatiale-Matra. 

On 10 July 2000, Aérospatiale-Matra merged with DASA and Spanish aviation company Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA and to form the multinational European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS). EADS would later rebrand itself as Airbus, taking the name of its commercial aircraft division, its primary business.

During 2001, Aérospatiale-Matra&#x27;s missile division underwent a further merger with Anglo-French outfit Matra BAe Dynamics and the missile division of Alenia Marconi Systems to form the multinational MBDA entity.

<doc id="47660" wikidata="Q180289" url="?curid=47660" title="Espresso">
<text>Espresso (, ) is a concentrated form of coffee produced by forcing hot water under high pressure through finely ground coffee beans. Originating in Italy, espresso has become one of the most popular coffee-brewing methods worldwide. It is characterized by its small serving size, typically 25–30 ml, and its distinctive layers: a dark body topped with a lighter-colored foam called &quot;crema&quot;.

Espresso machines use pressure to extract a highly concentrated coffee with a complex flavor profile in a short time, usually 25–30 seconds. The result is a beverage with a higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids than regular drip coffee, giving espresso its characteristic body and intensity. Despite the stronger taste profile, espresso typically contains fewer milligrams of caffeine than a standard serving of drip-brewed coffee.

Espresso serves as the base for other coffee drinks, including cappuccino, caffè latte, and americano. It can be made with various types of coffee beans and roast levels, allowing for a wide range of flavors and strengths. The quality of an espresso is influenced by factors such as the grind size, water temperature, pressure, and the barista&#x27;s skill in tamping the coffee grounds.

While espresso contains more caffeine per unit volume than most coffee beverages, its typical serving size results in less caffeine per serving compared to larger drinks such as drip coffee. The cultural significance of espresso extends beyond its consumption, playing a central role in coffee shop culture and the third-wave coffee movement, which emphasizes artisanal production and high-quality beans.

==Etymology and spelling==
Some English dictionaries translate &quot;espresso&quot; as &#x27;pressed-out&#x27;, but the word also conveys the senses of &quot;expressly for you&quot; and &quot;quickly&quot;:

Modern espresso, using hot water under pressure, as pioneered by Gaggia in the 1940s, was originally called &quot;crema caffè&quot; (), as seen on old Gaggia machines, due to the crema.

The spelling &quot;expresso&quot; is mostly considered incorrect, although some sources call it a less common variant. It is common in French and Portuguese. Italy uses the term &quot;espresso&quot;, substituting &quot;s&quot; for most &quot;x&quot; letters in Latin-root words, with the term deriving from the past participle of the Italian verb &quot;esprimere&quot;, itself derived from the Latin &quot;exprimere&quot;, which means &#x27;to express&#x27;, and refers to the process by which hot water is forced under pressure through ground coffee; &quot;x&quot; is not considered part of the standard Italian alphabet. Italians commonly refer to espresso simply as &quot;caffè&quot; (), espresso being the ordinary coffee to order. The same happens in Portugal (&quot;café&quot;), with some regional variations (&quot;bica&quot; in Lisbon and &quot;cimbalino&quot; traditionally in Porto). In Spain, while &quot;café expreso&quot; is seen as the more formal denomination, &quot;café solo&quot; (alone, without milk) is the usual way to ask for it at an espresso bar. Some sources state that &quot;expresso&quot; is an incorrect spelling, including &quot;Garner&#x27;s Modern American Usage&quot;. While the &#x27;expresso&#x27; spelling is recognized as mainstream usage in some American dictionaries, some cooking websites call the &#x27;x&#x27; variant illegitimate. Oxford Dictionaries online states: &quot;The spelling &quot;expresso&quot; is not used in the original Italian and is strictly incorrect, although it is common.&quot; The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; and &quot;Merriam-Webster&quot; call it a variant spelling. The &quot;Online Etymology Dictionary&quot; calls &quot;expresso&quot; a variant of &quot;espresso&quot;. The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of American Usage and Style&quot; (2000) describes the spelling &quot;expresso&quot; as &quot;wrong&quot;, and specifies &quot;espresso&quot; as the only correct form. The third edition of Fowler&#x27;s &quot;Modern English Usage&quot;, published by the Oxford University Press in 1996, noted that the form &quot;espresso&quot; &quot;has entirely driven out the variant &quot;expresso&quot; (which was presumably invented under the impression that it meant &#x27;fast, express&#x27;)&quot;.

==History==

===Precursors===
Angelo Moriondo, from Turin, patented a steam-driven &quot;instantaneous&quot; coffee beverage making device in 1884 (No. 33/256). The device is &quot;almost certainly the first Italian bar machine that controlled the supply of steam and water separately through the coffee&quot; and Moriondo is &quot;certainly one of the earliest discoverers of the expresso machine, if not the earliest&quot;. He was granted patent no. 33/256 dated 16 May 1884 (according to the &quot;Bollettino delle privative industriali del Regno d&#x27;Italia&quot;, 2nd Series, Volume 15, Year 1884, pp. 635 – 655). Unlike true espresso machines, it brewed in bulk, not as individual servings.

Seventeen years later, in 1901, Luigi Bezzera, from Milan, devised and patented several improvements to the espresso machine, the first of which was applied for on 19 December 1901. Titled &quot;Innovations in the machinery to prepare and immediately serve coffee beverage&quot;; Patent No. 153/94, 61707, was granted on 5 June 1902. In 1903, the patent was bought by Desiderio Pavoni, who founded the La Pavoni company and began to produce the machine industrially, manufacturing one machine daily in a small workshop in Via Parini, Milan.

===Spread===

A detailed discussion of the spread of espresso is given in . In Italy, the rise of espresso consumption was associated with industrialization and urbanization, notably in Turin, Genoa, and Milan, in northwest Italy. Italians also spread espresso culture into their East African colonies, Italian Somalia and Italian Eritrea.

The third-wave coffee movement encompasses espresso machines as a broader coffee culture that values relationships with growers and importers and the craftsmanship involved in making specific coffee-based drinks. The mention of brands such as Synesso, La Marzocco, and Slayer, known for their top-notch equipment, highlights the differences between traditional espresso machines and super-automatic machines to achieve a complete coffee preparation.

==Characteristics==
Espresso is generally thicker than coffee brewed by other methods, with a viscosity similar to that of warm honey. This is due to the higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids and the crema on top (a foam with a creamy consistency). As a result of the pressurized brewing process, the flavors and chemicals in a typical cup of espresso are very concentrated.

Espresso contains more caffeine per unit volume than most coffee beverages, but as its usual serving size of 25–30 ml (1 US oz) is much smaller than other coffee drinks, the overall caffeine content of a single &quot;serving&quot; of espresso is generally lower than that of other coffees. While the exact caffeine content of any coffee drink will vary, a typical serving of espresso contains approximately 65 milligrams of caffeine, but a typical serving of drip coffee contains 150–200 mg of caffeine.

The three dispersed phases in espresso are what make the beverage unique. The first dispersed phase is an emulsion of oil droplets. The second phase is suspended solids, while the third is the layer of gas bubbles or foam. The dispersion of very small oil droplets is perceived in the mouth as creamy. This characteristic of espresso contributes to what is known as the body of the beverage. These oil droplets preserve some of the aromatic compounds that are lost to the air in other coffee forms, enhancing the strong flavor of espresso.

The crema is a layer of dense foam that forms on top of the drink. It consists of emulsified oils in the ground coffee turned into a colloid, which does not occur in other brewing methods. Crema is produced when water placed under very high pressure dissolves more carbon dioxide, a gas present inside the coffee that is produced during the roasting process.

Espresso is served on its own, and is also used as the base for various other coffee drinks, including caffè latte, cappuccino, &quot;caffè macchiato&quot;, &quot;caffè mocha&quot;, flat white, and americano.

==Process==
Espresso is made by forcing very hot water under high pressure through finely ground compacted coffee. There is no universal standard defining the process of extracting espresso, but several published definitions attempt to constrain the amount and type of ground coffee used, the temperature and pressure of the water, and the rate of extraction. Generally, one uses an espresso machine to make espresso.

The act of producing a shot of espresso is often called &quot;pulling&quot; a shot, originating from lever espresso machines, with which a barista pulls down a handle attached to a spring-loaded piston, which forces hot water through the coffee at high pressure. However, it is more common for an electric pump to generate the pressure.

Tamping down the coffee promotes the water&#x27;s even penetration through the grounds. This process produces a thicker beverage by extracting both solid and dissolved components.

The technical parameters outlined by the Italian Espresso National Institute for making a &quot;certified Italian espresso&quot; are:

===Roasts===
Any bean or roasting level can be used to produce authentic espresso. For example, in southern Italy, a darker roast is generally preferred. Farther north, the trend moves toward slightly lighter roasts, while outside Italy a wide range is popular.

===Variables===

The main variables in a shot of espresso are the &quot;size&quot; and &quot;length&quot;. This terminology is standardized, but the precise sizes and proportions vary substantially.

Cafés may have a standardized shot (size and length), such as &quot;triple ristretto&quot;, only varying the number of shots in espresso-based drinks such as lattes, but not changing the extraction. Changing between a double and a triple requires changing the filter basket size, while changing between ristretto, &quot;normale&quot;, and lungo may require changing the grind.

The size can be a single, double, or triple, using a proportional amount of ground coffee, roughly 7, 14, and 21 grams; correspondingly sized filter baskets are used. The Italian multiplier term &quot;doppio&quot; is often used for a double, with &quot;solo&quot; and &quot;triplo&quot; being more rarely used for singles and triples. The single shot is the traditional shot size, being the maximum that could easily be pulled on a lever machine. Single baskets are sharply tapered or stepped down in diameter to provide comparable depth to the double baskets and, therefore, comparable resistance to water pressure. Most double baskets are gently tapered (the &quot;Faema model&quot;), while others, such as the La Marzocco, have straight sides. Triple baskets are normally straight-sided. Portafilters will often come with two spouts, usually closely spaced, and a double-size basket. Each spout can optionally dispense into a separate cup, yielding two &quot;solo&quot;-size (but doppio-brewed) shots, or into a single cup (hence the close spacing). True &quot;solo&quot; shots are rare, with a single shot in a café generally being half of a doppio shot. In espresso-based drinks in America, particularly larger milk-based drinks, a drink with three or four shots of espresso will be called &quot;triple&quot; or &quot;quad&quot;, respectively.

The length of the shot can be ristretto (or &quot;stretto&quot;) (reduced), &quot;normale&quot; or standard (normal), or lungo (long): these may correspond to a smaller or larger drink with the same amount of ground coffee and same level of extraction or to different length of extraction. Proportions vary, and the volume (and low density) of crema makes volume-based comparisons difficult (precise measurement uses the mass of the drink). Typically, ristretto is half the volume of &quot;normale&quot;, and lungo is double to triple the &quot;normale&quot; volume. For a double shot (14 grams of dry coffee), a &quot;normale&quot; uses about 60 ml of water. A double ristretto, a common form associated with espresso, uses half the amount of water, about 30 ml. Ristretto a shorter sweeter shot of espresso with less water, &quot;normale&quot;, and lungo may not simply be the same shot stopped at different times (which could result in an under- or over-extracted shot), but have the grind adjusted (finer for ristretto, coarser for lungo) to achieve the target volume. A significantly longer shot is the &quot;caffè crema&quot;, which is longer than a lungo, ranging in size from , and brewed in the same way, with a coarser grind. Passing too much water through the ground coffee can add other, potentially unpleasant flavors to the espresso.

===Machines===

Home espresso machines have increased in popularity with the general rise of interest in espresso. Today, a wide range of home espresso equipment can be found in kitchen and appliance stores, online vendors, and department stores. The first espresso machine for home use was the Gaggia Gilda. Soon afterwards, similar machines such as the Faema Faemina, FE-AR La Peppina, and VAM Caravel followed suit, with similar form factors and operational principles. These machines still have a small but dedicated share of fans. Until the advent of the first small electrical pump-based espresso machines, such as the Gaggia Baby and Quickmill 810, home espresso machines were not widely adopted. In recent years, the increased availability of convenient countertop fully automatic home espresso makers and pod-based espresso serving systems has increased the quantity of espresso consumed at home. The popularity of home espresso making parallels the increase of home coffee roasting. Some amateurs pursue both home roasting coffee and making espresso.

==Espresso-based drinks==

In addition to being served alone, espresso is frequently blended, notably with milk, either steamed (without significant foam), wet foamed (microfoam) and dry foamed, or with hot water.


Other variants:

<text> () is a Finnish word meaning &#x27;evil spirit&#x27; and a popular Finnish profanity, used similarly to the English phrase &quot;god damn&quot;, although it is considered much more profane. It is most likely the most internationally known Finnish curse word.

== Etymology ==
The name is of Indo-European origin; Perkwunos is the reconstructed name of the god of thunder.

Some researchers consider to be an original name of the thunder god Ukko, the chief god of the Finnish pagan pantheon, but this view is not shared by all researchers. There are related words in other Finnic languages: in Estonian, means hell, in Karelian means an evil spirit.

=== Influence of Christianity ===
As Finland was Christianized, the ancient pre-Christian deities came to be regarded as demons. This led to the use of &quot;&quot; as a translation for &quot;Devil&quot; in the Finnish translation of the Bible. Later, in other translations, the word was rendered as (the evil one).

<text>Antonov (d/b/a Antonov Company, formerly the Aeronautical Scientific-Technical Complex named after Antonov or Antonov ASTC, and earlier the Antonov Design Bureau, for its chief designer, Oleg Antonov) is a Ukrainian aircraft manufacturing and services company. Antonov&#x27;s particular expertise is in the fields of very large aeroplanes and aeroplanes using unprepared runways. Antonov (model prefix &quot;An-&quot;) has built a total of approximately 22,000 aircraft, and thousands of its planes are operating in the former Soviet Union and in developing countries.

Antonov Company is a state-owned commercial company originally established in Novosibirsk, Russia. In 1952, the company relocated to Kiev, Ukrainian SSR, then part of the Soviet Union. On 12 May 2015, it was transferred from the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade to the Ukroboronprom (Ukrainian Defense Industry).

In June 2016, Ukraine&#x27;s major state-owned arms manufacturer Ukroboronprom announced the creation of the Ukrainian Aircraft Corporation within its structure, to combine all aircraft manufacturing enterprises in Ukraine.

==History==

===Soviet era===
====Foundation and relocation====
The company was established in 1946 at the Novosibirsk Aircraft Production Association as the top-secret Soviet Research and Design Bureau No. 153 (OKB-153). It was headed by Oleg Antonov and specialised in turboprop military transport aircraft. The task was to create an agricultural aircraft CX-1 (An-2), the first flight of which occurred on 31 August 1947. The An-2 biplane was a major achievement of this period, with hundreds of these aircraft still operating as of 2013. In addition to this biplane and its modifications, a small series of gliders A-9 and A-10 were created and built in the pilot production in Novosibirsk. In 1952, the Bureau was relocated to Kiev, a city with a rich aviation history and an aircraft-manufacturing infrastructure restored after the destruction caused by World War II.

====First serial aircraft and expansion====

The 1957 introduction of the An-10/An-12 family of mid-range turboprop aeroplanes began the successful production of thousands of these aircraft. Their use for both heavy combat and civilian purposes around the globe continues to the present; the An-10/An-12 were used most notably in the Vietnam War, the Soviet–Afghan War and the Chernobyl disaster relief megaoperation.

In 1959, the bureau began construction of the separate Flight Testing and Improvement Base in suburban Hostomel (now the Antonov Airport).

In 1965, the Antonov An-22 heavy military transport entered serial production to supplement the An-12 in major military and humanitarian airlifts by the Soviet Union. The model became the first Soviet wide-body aircraft, and it remains the world&#x27;s largest turboprop-powered aircraft. Antonov designed and presented a nuclear-powered version of the An-22. It was never flight tested.

In 1966, after the major expansion in the Sviatoshyn neighbourhood of the city, the company was renamed to another disguise name: &quot;Kiev Mechanical Plant&quot;. Two independent aircraft production and repair facilities, under engineering supervision of the Antonov Bureau, also appeared in Kiev during this period.

====Prominence and Antonov&#x27;s retirement====
In the 1970s and early 1980s, the company established itself as the Soviet Union&#x27;s main designer of military transport aircraft with dozens of new modifications in development and production. After Oleg Antonov&#x27;s death in 1984, the company was officially renamed as the Research and Design Bureau named after O.K. Antonov () while continuing the use of &quot;Kiev Mechanical Plant&quot; alias for some purposes.

====Late Soviet-era: superlarge projects and first commercialisation====
In the late 1980s, the Antonov Bureau achieved global prominence after the introduction of its extra large aeroplanes. The An-124 &quot;Ruslan&quot; (1982) became the Soviet Union&#x27;s mass-produced strategic airlifter under the leadership of Chief Designer Viktor Tolmachev. The Bureau enlarged the &quot;Ruslan&quot; design even more for the Soviet spaceplane programme logistics, creating the An-225 &quot;Mriya&quot; in 1985. &quot;Mriya&quot; was the world&#x27;s largest and heaviest aeroplane.

The end of the Cold War and perestroika allowed the Antonov company&#x27;s first step to commercialisation and foreign expansion. In 1989, the Antonov Airlines subsidiary was created for its own aircraft maintenance and cargo projects.

===Independent Ukraine===

Antonov Design Bureau remained a state-owned company after Ukraine achieved its independence in 1991 and is since regarded as a strategic national asset.

====Expansion to free market====
Since independence, Antonov has certified and marketed both Soviet-era and newly developed models for sale in new markets outside of the former soviet sphere of influence. New models introduced to serial production and delivered to customers include the Antonov An-140, Antonov An-148 and Antonov An-158 regional airliners.

Among several modernisation projects, Antonov received orders for upgrading &quot;hundreds&quot; of its An-2 utility planes still in operation in Azerbaijan, Cuba and Russia to the An-2-100 upgrade version.

In 2014, following the annexation of the Crimea by Russia, Ukraine cancelled contracts with Russia, leading to a significant income reduction in Ukraine&#x27;s defense and aviation industries. However Ukraine has been slowly recovering the deficit from breaking ties with Russia by entering new markets such as the Persian Gulf region and expanding its presence in old ones such as India.

In July 2018, Antonov was able to secure a deal with Boeing in order to procure airplane parts which were no longer available due to breakdown of relations with Russia.

====Production facilities&#x27; consolidation====
During the Soviet period, not all Antonov-designed aircraft were manufactured by the company itself. This was a result of Soviet industrial strategy that split military production between different regions of the Soviet Union to minimise potential war loss risks. As a result, Antonov aeroplanes were often assembled by the specialist contract manufacturers.

In 2009, the once-independent &quot;Aviant&quot; aeroplane-assembling plant in Kyiv became part of Antonov, facilitating a full serial manufacturing cycle of the company. However, the old tradition of co-manufacturing with contractors is continued, both with Soviet-time partners and with new licensees like Iran&#x27;s Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industrial Company.

In 2014, Antonov produced and delivered only two An-158 airplanes. This trend continued into 2015, producing one An-148 and one An-158. Since 2016, no aircraft have been produced or delivered to clients.
In June 2016, Ukraine&#x27;s major state-owned arms manufacturer Ukroboronprom announced the creation of the Ukrainian Aircraft Corporation within its structure, thereby combining all aircraft manufacturing enterprises, including the assets of Antonov into a single cluster, according to Ukroboronprom&#x27;s press service.

On 19 July 2017, the Ukrainian government approved the liquidation of Antonov&#x27;s assets. The State Concern &quot;Antonov&quot; (a business group, created in 2005 from the merger of several legally independent companies into a single economic entity under unified management) will be liquidated as a residual corporate entity. Antonov State Company, Kharkiv State Aviation Manufacturing Enterprise and Plant No.410 of Civil Aviation were transferred under the management of another state-owned concern Ukroboronprom in 2015. Antonov State Company continues to function as an enterprise.

On 31 March 2017, the first prototype of a new multifunctional cargo plane An-132 – a demonstration plane An-132D – took to the air from the runway of Sviatoshyn airfield. The An-132 development program had been implemented in the framework of a contract with a customer from Saudi Arabia.

On 24 February 2022, at the beginning of Russia&#x27;s full-scale invasion in Ukraine, the first attacks were launched at Kyiv-Antonov-2 airfield, the site of Antonov&#x27;s test flights and home base of the planes of &quot;Antonov Airlines&quot;. The planes Аn-225 &quot;Mriya&quot;, An-26, An-74 and administrative premises were destroyed. The planes Аn-12, Аn-22, Аn-28, Аn-132D and Аn-124-100-150, the hangars and other infrastructure were severely damaged.

The Security Service of Ukraine established that the former director general of Antonov Company Serhiy Bychkov had not provided access to the site for the National Guard in January and February 2022 and thus obstructed preparations for defence.

The investigators consider that Bychkov&#x27;s negligence is the direct cause of the loss of &quot;Mriya&quot;, because the plane could have been sent to Germany long before February 24. In March 2023, Serhiy Bychkov was arrested, in April he faced formal suspicion in connection with the loss of An-225 &quot;Mriya&quot; and damages to Antonov amounting to ₴8.4 million.

==Aircraft==
Antonov&#x27;s primary activity has generally been in developing large military transport aircraft, including the world&#x27;s largest airplanes, chiefly for the Russian Federation and its predecessor nations.

Additionally, Antonov has produced airliners. It has also produced numerous variants of both transports and airliners, for operations ranging from air freight hauling to military reconnaissance, command and control operations.

It has also developed various general aviation light aircraft, having originated as a producer of gliders.

===Transports, airliners and derivatives===
Antonov&#x27;s aeroplanes (design office prefix &quot;An&quot;) range from the rugged An-2 biplane through the An-28 reconnaissance aircraft to the massive An-124 Ruslan and An-225 Mriya strategic airlifters (the latter being the world&#x27;s heaviest aircraft and was the only one in service).

Sometimes defunct and sometimes normal, the An-24, An-26, An-30 and An-32 family of twin turboprop, high-winged, passenger-cargo-troop transport aircraft are important for domestic/short-haul air services particularly in parts of the world once led by communist governments. The An-72/An-74 series of small jetliners is slowly replacing that fleet, and a larger An-70 freighter is under certification.

The Antonov An-148 is a new regional airliner of twin-turbofan configuration. Over 150 aircraft have been ordered since 2007. A stretched version is in development, the An-158 (from 60–70 to 90–100 passengers).

<text>British Aerospace plc (BAe) was a British aircraft, munitions and defence-systems manufacturer that was formed in 1977. Its head office was at Warwick House in the Farnborough Aerospace Centre in Farnborough, Hampshire. It purchased Marconi Electronic Systems, the defence electronics and naval shipbuilding subsidiary of the General Electric Company, in 1999 to form BAE Systems.

==History==
===Formation and privatisation===
The company has its origins in the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977, which called for the nationalisation and merger of the British Aircraft Corporation, Hawker Siddeley Aviation, Hawker Siddeley Dynamics and Scottish Aviation. On 29 April 1977, the new entity was formed in the United Kingdom as a statutory corporation.

Under the provisions of the British Aerospace Act 1980 (c. 26), on 1 January the statutory corporation was transferred to a limited company, which then re-registered as a public limited company (plc), under the name &quot;British Aerospace Public Limited Company&quot;, on 2 January 1981. BAe was privatised in two main phases, the first in February 1981, involving 51.6% shares of the company, during which the public sale was 3.5 times subscribed and at the end of the first day&#x27;s trading, share prices were 14% above the original offer price. The second phase occurred in May 1985, in which 48.4% shares were sold; this sale was 5.4 times subscribed and the first day closing price was 11% above the initial offer price. The British Government maintained a £1 golden share, which allowed it to veto foreign control of the board or company.

===Programmes===

British Aerospace inherited a number of live development programmes from its predecessors. Scottish Aviation was working on a project for a 19-seat turboprop airliner, an upgraded version of the Handley Page Jetstream. BAe placed the Jetstream 31 into production after the first flight of the prototype in March 1980. At the same time, production of Hawker Siddeley&#x27;s HS 125 business jet, Harrier VTOL jet fighter and HS 748 turboprop airliner continued under BAe, as did that of the Trident jet airliner for a short time. Similarly, low-rate production of the BAC One-Eleven jet airliner, the Strikemaster two-seat military jet trainer/attack aircraft, and the iconic Concorde supersonic airliner also continued. 

On 29 July 1976, less than a year prior to BAe&#x27;s formation, the contract for production of the first batch of the Panavia Tornado, an advanced nuclear-capable fighter bomber, was signed. It was developed and produced via a multinational company, Panavia Aircraft GmbH, of which BAe was one of several companies to be heavily involved. On 10 July 1979, the maiden flight of a production Tornado occurred. On 5 and 6 June 1979, the first aircraft were delivered to the RAF and German Air Force respectively. On 25 September 1981, the first Italian Tornado was delivered. 

The Tornado would be produced in large numbers, the 500th aircraft to be completed was delivered to West Germany on 19 December 1987. Production of the Tornado ended in 1998, the final batch being delivered to the Royal Saudi Air Force, that had ordered a total of 96 IDS Tornados. Aviation author Jon Lake noted that &quot;The Trinational Panavia Consortium produced just short of 1,000 Tornados, making it one of the most successful postwar bomber programs&quot;.

In 1978, BAe relaunched the BAe 146, a short-haul regional airliner that had been previously worked on by Hawker Siddeley. The company marketed it as a quiet and economic turbofan-powered compact airliner that could replace the previous generation of turboprop-powered feeder aircraft. In 1982, the first completed aircraft made its first flight. Upon its launch into service the following year, it was hailed as being &quot;the world&#x27;s quietest jetliner&quot;. In 1993, an upgraded model of the BAe 146, referred to as the &quot;Avro RJ&quot; series, superseded the original; changes included the replacement of the original Lycoming ALF 502 turbofan engines by higher-thrust LF 507 turbofan engines, which were housed in redesigned nacelles. The Avro RJ series also featured a modernised cockpit with EFIS replacing the analogue ADI, HSI, and engine instrumentation. Production of the Avro RJ ended with the final four aircraft being delivered in late 2003; a total of 173 Avro RJ aircraft was delivered between 1993 and 2003.
BAe developed several advanced models of the Harrier family. In 1978, the Royal Navy received the first BAe Sea Harrier of an initial order for 24. The Sea Harrier was declared operational three years later, being initially embarked on both the first &quot;Invincible&quot; class aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Invincible&quot;, and the older HMS &quot;Hermes&quot;. Following their decisive role in the 1982 Falklands War, several of the lessons learnt from the conflict shaped a new upgrade programme for the fleet authorised in 1984, resulting in the &quot;Sea Harrier FRS.2&quot; (later known as &quot;FA2&quot;). The first flight of the prototype took place in September 1988 and a contract was signed for 29 upgraded aircraft in December of that year. The Sea Harrier FA2 was fitted with the Blue Vixen radar, which was described as one of the most advanced pulse doppler radar systems in the world.

In August 1981, BAe and the American aircraft manufacturer McDonnell Douglas signed a memorandum of understanding regarding the McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II. Under this agreement, BAe was effectively a subcontractor rather than a full partner, receiving 40 per cent of the airframe&#x27;s work-share in terms of man-hours. Production took place at McDonnell Douglas&#x27; facilities in suburban St Louis, Missouri, and manufacturing by BAe at its Kingston and Dunsfold facilities in Surrey, England. The variant procured for the RAF, which was known as the BAe Harrier II, featured many differences, including avionics fit, armaments and equipment; the wing of the GR5 featured a stainless steel leading edge, giving it different flex characteristics from the AV-8B. In December 1989, the first RAF squadron to be equipped with the Harrier II was declared operational.

In 1979, BAe officially joined the multinational aircraft manufacturer Airbus and acquired a 20% share in the venture, the move effectively reversed a decision made ten years prior in which the UK government had withdrawn its support for the Airbus consortium. Airbus&#x27; first aircraft, the A300, had been received with little initial demand, but orders for the airliner had picked up in the late 1970s. By 1979, the consortium had 256 orders for A300, and Airbus had launched its second airliner, the A310, less than 12 months prior to BAe formally joining the consortium. As time went on, it was becoming clear that Airbus was no longer a temporary collaboration to produce a single design as per its original mission statement; it had become a long-term brand for the development of further aircraft. By the late 1980s, work had begun on a pair of new wide-body airliners, the biggest to be produced at this point under the Airbus name; these would be launched in the 1990s as the Airbus A330 and the Airbus A340.
During the 1983 Paris Air Show, the launch of the &quot;Experimental Aircraft Programme&quot; (EAP) to develop and fly an advanced fighter technology demonstrator was announced; at this point, the effort was intended to be a partnership between Britain and several of its European neighbours, including West Germany and Italy. The resulting aircraft, the British Aerospace EAP, ended up being primarily developed by BAe as a private venture; it formed the basis for the multinational Eurofighter Typhoon. In 1986, in conjunction Alenia Aeronautica, CASA and DASA, BAe formed Eurofighter GmbH for the development and production of the Eurofighter. The multinational organisation&#x27;s head office was established in Hallbergmoos, Bavaria, Germany. The maiden flight of the Eurofighter prototype took place in Bavaria on 27 March 1994, flown by DASA chief test pilot Peter Weger. On 30 January 1998, the first production contract for the Eurofighter was signed between Eurofighter GmbH, engine manufacturer Eurojet and the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency, the organisation set up to manage the procurement of the aircraft.

On 26 September 1985, the UK and Saudi Arabian governments signed the Al-Yamamah arms deal with BAe as prime contractor. The contracts, extended in the 1990s and never fully detailed, involved the supply of Panavia Tornado strike and air defence aircraft, BAe Hawk trainer jets, Rapier missile systems, infrastructure works and naval vessels. The Al Yamamah deals are valued at anything up to £20 billion and still continue to provide a large percentage of BAE Systems&#x27; profits.

===Acquisitions and restructuring===
BAe acquired Royal Ordnance, the British armaments manufacturer, for £190 million on 22 April 1987. The German armaments specialist Heckler &amp; Koch was folded into this division after BAe acquired it four years later.

In 1988, BAe purchased the Rover Group from the British government of Margaret Thatcher for £150 million. The sale was controversial due to opaque financial arrangements between the government and BAe; however the House of Commons Trade and Industry Committee was said to believe that &quot;in spite of a catalogue of complaints, the committee concludes that the sale to BAe may well have been the best solution for the government.&quot;

In 1991, BAe acquired a 30% interest in Hutchison Telecommunications through a stock swap deal, where Hutchison was given a controlling stake of 65% in BAe&#x27;s wholly owned subsidiary Microtel Communications Ltd. In August 1991, BAe formed a naval systems joint venture, BAeSEMA, with the Sema Group. BAe acquired Sema&#x27;s 50% share in 1998. That year also saw BAe begin to experience major difficulties. BAe saw its share price fall below 100p for the first time. On 9 September 1991, the company issued a profits warning and later that week &quot;bungled&quot; the launch of a £432 million rights issue. On 25 September 1991 BAe directors led by CEO Richard Evans ousted the Chairman Professor Sir Roland Smith in a move described by &quot;The Independent&quot; as &quot;one of the most spectacular and brutal boardroom coups witnessed in many years.&quot; Evans described the troubles as a confluence of events:
 &quot;our property company [Arlington Securities] was hit with a lousy market. Sales of the Rover Group sank by about a fifth and losses mounted. The government&#x27;s defence spending volumes underwent a major review. Losses in our commercial aerospace division increased dramatically with the recession in the airline industry.&quot;

In mid-1992, BAe wrote off £1 billion of assets, largely as part of redundancies and restructuring of its regional aircraft division. This was the largest asset write-off in UK corporate history. General Electric Company (GEC), later to sell its defence interests to BAe, came close to acquiring BAe at this time. BAe cut 47% of its workforce (60,000 out of 127,000), 40,000 of which were from the regional aircraft division.

Evans decided to sell non-core business activities, which included the Rover Group, Arlington Securities, BAe Corporate Jets, BAe Communications and Ballast Nedam. Although the rationale of diversification was sound (to shield the company from cyclical aerospace and defence markets) the struggling company could not afford to continue the position: &quot;We simply could not afford to carry two core businesses, cars and aerospace. At one point Rover was eating up about £2 billion of our banking capacity.&quot; BAe Corporate Jets and Arkansas Aerospace were sold to Raytheon in 1993. In 1994, the Rover Group was sold to BMW and British Aerospace Space Systems was sold to Matra Marconi Space. In 1998, BAe&#x27;s shareholding of Orange plc was reduced to 5%. The Orange shareholding was a legacy of the 30% stake in Hutchison Telecommunications (UK) Ltd.

In 1994, BAeSEMA, Siemens Plessey and GEC-Marconi formed UKAMS Limited as part of the Principal Anti-Air Missile System (PAAMS) consortium. UKAMS would become a wholly owned subsidiary of BAe Dynamics in 1998. In 1995, Saab Military Aircraft and BAe signed an agreement for the joint development and marketing of the export version of the JAS 39 Gripen. In 1996, BAe and Matra Defense agreed to merge their missile businesses into a joint venture called Matra BAe Dynamics. In 1997, BAe joined the Lockheed Martin X-35 Joint Strike Fighter team. The following year, BAe acquired the UK operations of Siemens Plessey Systems (SPS) from Siemens, while DASA purchased SPS&#x27; German assets.

In the 1990s, BAe was the largest exporter based in the United Kingdom; a Competition Commission report released in 2005 calculated a ten-year aggregate figure of £45 billion, with defence sales accounting for approximately 80%.

===Transition to BAE Systems===
In the late 1990s, European defence consolidation became a prevailing practice; European governments wished to see the merger of their defence manufacturers into a single entity, a European Aerospace and Defence Company. This ambition led to numerous reports linking various European defence groups – mainly with each other but also with American defence contractors. In July 1998, merger discussions began between BAe and DASA. Terms for such a merger had been reportedly agreed between British Aerospace Chairman Richard Evans and DASA CEO Jürgen Schrempp in December 1998. However, when the British General Electric Company (GEC) put its defence electronics business Marconi Electronic Systems (MES) up for sale on 22 December 1998, BAe&#x27;s management opted to abandon the DASA merger in favour of purchasing its British rival. During 2004, Evans stated that his fear was that an American defence contractor would acquire MES and challenge both British Aerospace and DASA.

Schrempp was angered by BAe&#x27;s reversal, and opted to pursue other partner companies for DASA to merge with. On 11 June 1999, the Spanish aircraft company CASA signed a memorandum of understanding for such a merger. On 14 October 1999, DASA agreed to merge with Aérospatiale-Matra to create the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS). 10 July 2000 was &quot;day one&quot; for the new company, which became the world&#x27;s second-largest aerospace company after Boeing and the second-largest European arms manufacturer after BAE Systems.

The GEC merger to create a solely British company, compared to the prospective Anglo-German company that would have resulted from merging with DASA, was promoted as having superior prospects for further penetration of the lucrative defence market of the United States. The newly combined company, which was initially referred to as &quot;New British Aerospace&quot;, was officially formed on 30 November 1999; it is named BAE Systems.

==Corruption investigation and criticisms==
There have been allegations that the Al Yamamah contracts were a result of bribes (&quot;douceurs&quot;) to members of the Saudi royal family and government officials. Some allegations suggested that the former Prime Minister&#x27;s son Mark Thatcher may have been involved; he has strongly denied receiving payments or exploiting his mother&#x27;s connections in his business dealings. The National Audit Office investigated the contracts and has so far never released its conclusions – the only NAO report ever to be withheld. The BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; observed that it is ironic that the once classified report analysing the construction of MI5&#x27;s Thames House and MI6&#x27;s Vauxhall Cross headquarters has been released, but the Al Yamamah report is still deemed too sensitive.

The 2007 documentary film &quot;Welcome Aboard Toxic Airlines&quot; contained evidence that vital data was withheld from a 1999–2000 Australian Senate Inquiry into the health and flight safety issues relating to oil fumes on the British Aerospace 146. The film also contains an Australian Senator&#x27;s speech about money being paid by BAe for silence on the fumes issue.

<text>Marconi Electronic Systems (MES), or GEC-Marconi as it was until 1998, was the defence arm of General Electric Company (GEC). It was split off from GEC and bought by British Aerospace (BAe) on 30 November 1999 to form BAE Systems. GEC then renamed itself Marconi plc.

MES exists today as BAE Systems Electronics Limited, a subsidiary of BAE Systems, but the assets were rearranged elsewhere within that company. MES-related businesses include BAE Systems Submarine Solutions, BAE Systems Surface Ships, BAE Systems Insyte and Selex ES (now a part of Leonardo).

== History ==
The Marconi Company had been formed by Guglielmo Marconi in 1897 in Britain, originally under the name of The Wireless Telegraph &amp; Signal Company. Following GEC&#x27;s acquisition of Marconi as part of English Electric in 1968, the Marconi brand was used for its defence businesses, e.g. Marconi Space &amp; Defence Systems (MSDS), Marconi Underwater Systems Ltd (MUSL). 

When it was bought by General Electric, MES represented the pinnacle of GEC&#x27;s defence businesses which had a heritage of almost 100 years. GEC&#x27;s history of military products dates back to World War I with its contribution to the war effort then including radios and bulbs. World War II consolidated this position with the company involved in many important technological advances, most notably radar.

Between 1945 and GEC&#x27;s demerger of its defence business in 1999, the company became a major defence contractor. GEC&#x27;s major defence related acquisitions included Associated Electrical Industries in 1967, English Electric Company (including Marconi as a subsidiary) in 1968, Yarrow Shipbuilders in 1985, parts of Ferranti&#x27;s defence business in 1990, Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering in 1995 and Kvaerner Govan in 1999. In June 1998, MES acquired Tracor, a major American defence contractor, for US$1.4 billion.

=== Demerger ===
The 1997 merger of American corporations Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, which followed the forming of Lockheed Martin, the world&#x27;s largest defence contractor in 1995, increased the pressure on European defence companies to consolidate. In June 1997, British Aerospace Defence managing director John Weston commented &quot;Europe... is supporting three times the number of contractors on less than half the budget of the U.S.&quot;. European governments wished to see the merger of their defence manufacturers into a single entity, a European Aerospace and Defence Company.

As early as 1995, British Aerospace and the German aerospace and defence company DaimlerChrysler Aerospace (DASA) were said to be keen to create a transnational aerospace and defence company. Merger discussions began between British Aerospace and DASA in July 1998. A merger was agreed between British Aerospace chairman Richard Evans and DASA CEO Jürgen Schrempp in December 1998.

GEC was also under pressure to participate in defence industry consolidation. Reporting the appointment of George Simpson as GEC managing director in 1996, &quot;The Independent&quot; had said &quot;some analysts believe that Mr Simpson&#x27;s inside knowledge of BAe, a long-rumoured GEC bid target, was a key to his appointment. GEC favours forging a national &quot;champion&quot; defence group with BAe to compete with the giant US organisations&quot;. When GEC put MES up for sale on 22 December 1998, BAE abandoned the DASA merger in favour of purchasing its British rival. The merger of British Aerospace and MES was announced on 19 January 1999. Evans stated that in 2004 that his fear was that an American defence contractor would acquire MES and challenge both British Aerospace and DASA. The merger created a vertically integrated company which &quot;The Scotsman&quot; described as &quot;[a combination of British Aerospace&#x27;s] contracting and platform-building skills with Marconi&#x27;s coveted electronics systems capability&quot;. for example combining the manufacturer of the Eurofighter with the company that provided many of the aircraft&#x27;s electronic systems; British Aerospace was MES&#x27; largest customer. In contrast, DASA&#x27;s response to the breakdown of the merger discussion was to merge with Aérospatiale to create the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), a horizontal integration. EADS has since considered a merger with Thales to create a &quot;fully rounded&quot; company.

While MES was responsible for the majority of GEC&#x27;s defence sales other GEC companies achieved defence related sales, principally GEC Alsthom, GEC-Plessey Telecommunications (GPT) and GEC Plessey Semiconductors.

<text>AviaBellanca Aircraft Corporation was an American aircraft design and manufacturing company. Prior to 1983, it was known as the Bellanca Aircraft Company. The company was founded in 1927 by Giuseppe Mario Bellanca, although it was preceded by previous businesses and partnerships in which aircraft with the Bellanca name were produced, including Wright-Bellanca, in which he was in partnership with Wright Aeronautical.

In 2021 the company was reformed as Bellanca Aircraft, Inc and located in Sulphur, Oklahoma. The new company supplies maintenance and aircraft parts, for the legacy Cruisemaster and Viking aircraft.


==History==
After Giuseppe Mario Bellanca, the designer and builder of Italy&#x27;s first aircraft, moved to the United States in 1911, he began to design aircraft for a number of firms, including the Maryland Pressed Steel Company, Wright Aeronautical Corporation and the Columbia Aircraft Corporation. Bellanca founded his own company, Bellanca Aircraft Corporation of America, in 1927, sited first in Richmond Hill, New York and moving in 1928 to New Castle (Wilmington), Delaware. In the 1920s and 1930s, Bellanca&#x27;s aircraft of his own design were known for their efficiency and low operating cost, gaining fame for world record endurance and distance flights. Lindbergh&#x27;s first choice for his New York to Paris flight was a Bellanca WB-2. The company&#x27;s insistence on selecting the crew drove Lindbergh to Ryan.

Bellanca remained president and chairman of the board from the corporation&#x27;s inception on the last day of 1927 until he sold the company to L. Albert and Sons in 1954. From that time on, the Bellanca line was part of a succession of companies that maintained the lineage of the original aircraft produced by Bellanca.

In 2022, the company moved from Alexandria, Minnesota to Sulphur, Oklahoma. While as of 2024 the company website states &quot;Bellanca recently opened a new aircraft factory and maintenance facility in Sulphur, Oklahoma,&quot; no new aircraft have been recently produced.

<doc id="47669" wikidata="Q1081921" url="?curid=47669" title="Santa Maria in Palmis">
<text>Santa Maria in Palmis (; ), also known as Chiesa del Domine Quo Vadis, is a small church southeast of Rome. It is located about some 800 m from Porta San Sebastiano, where the Via Ardeatina branches off the Appian Way, on the site where, according to the apocryphal &quot;Acts of Peter&quot;, Saint Peter met the risen Christ while Peter was fleeing persecution in Rome. According to the tradition, Peter asked him, &quot;Lord, where are you going?&quot; (). Christ answered, &quot;I am going to Rome to be crucified again&quot; ().

== History ==

There has been a sanctuary on the spot since the ninth century, but the current church is from 1637. The current façade was added in the 17th century.

It has been supposed that the sanctuary might have been even more ancient, perhaps a Christian adaptation of an already existing temple: the church is in fact located in front of the sacred &quot;campus&quot; dedicated to Rediculus, the Roman &quot;God of the Return&quot;. This &quot;campus&quot; hosted a sanctuary for the cult of the deity that received devotion by travellers before their departure, especially those going to face long and dangerous journeys to far-off places like Egypt, Greece or the East. Those travellers upon their safe return also stopped to thank the god for the happy outcome of their journey.

The presence of the Apostle Peter in this area, where he is supposed to have lived, appears to be confirmed in an epigraph in the Catacombs of Saint Sebastian that reads &quot;Domus Petri&quot; (). An epigram by Pope Damasus I (366–384) in honor of Peter and Paul reads: &quot;You that are looking for the names of Peter and Paul, you must know that the saints have lived here.&quot;

The two footprints on a marble slab at the center of the church — nowadays a copy of the original, which is kept in the nearby Basilica of San Sebastiano fuori le mura — are popularly believed to be a miraculous sign left by Jesus. The official name of the church alludes to these footprints: &quot;palmis&quot; refers to the soles of Jesus&#x27; feet. 

An inscription above the front door on the church&#x27;s façade used to say: &quot;Stop your walking, traveller, and enter this sacred temple in which you will find the footprint of our Lord Jesus Christ when He met with St. Peter who escaped from the prison. An alms for the wax and the oil is recommended in order to free some spirits from Purgatory.&quot; Pope Gregory XVI found the advertising tone of this inscription so inappropriate that he ordered its removal in 1845.

There is also a modern column with a bust of Henryk Sienkiewicz, the Polish author of the famous historical fiction novel &quot;Quo Vadis: A Narrative of the Time of Nero&quot; (1886). It is said that Sienkiewicz was inspired to write his novel while sitting in this church.

The church is currently administered by priests of the Congregation of Saint Michael the Archangel.

<doc id="47671" wikidata="Q19904193" url="?curid=47671" title="Toxic heavy metal">
<text>A toxic heavy metal is a common but misleading term for a metal-like element noted for its potential toxicity. Not all heavy metals are toxic and some toxic metals are not heavy. Elements often discussed as toxic include cadmium, mercury and lead, all of which appear in the World Health Organization&#x27;s list of 10 chemicals of major public concern. Other examples include chromium and nickel, thallium, bismuth, arsenic, antimony and tin.

These toxic elements are found naturally in the earth. They become concentrated as a result of human caused activities and can enter plant and animal (including human) tissues via inhalation, diet, and manual handling. Then, they can bind to and interfere with the functioning of vital cellular components. The toxic effects of arsenic, mercury, and lead were known to the ancients, but methodical studies of the toxicity of some heavy metals appear to date from only 1868. In humans, heavy metal poisoning is generally treated by the administration of chelating agents. Some elements otherwise regarded as toxic heavy metals are essential, in small quantities, for human health.

== Controversial terminology ==
The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), which standardizes nomenclature, says the term “heavy metals&quot;”&quot; is both meaningless and misleading&quot;. The IUPAC report focuses on the legal and toxicological implications of describing &quot;heavy metals&quot; as toxins when there is no scientific evidence to support a connection. The density implied by the adjective &quot;heavy&quot; has almost no biological consequences and pure metals are rarely the biologically active substance.
This characterization has been echoed by numerous reviews. The most widely used toxicology textbook, &quot;Casarett and Doull’s toxicology&quot; uses &quot;toxic metal&quot; not &quot;heavy metals&quot;. Nevertheless many scientific and science related articles continue to use &quot;heavy metal&quot; as a term for toxic substances.

== Major and minor metal toxins ==

Metals with multiple toxic effects include arsenic (As), beryllium (Be), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and nickel (Ni). 

Elements that are nutritionally essential for animal or plant life but which are considered toxic metals in high doses or other forms include cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn).
== Contamination sources ==
Toxic metals are found naturally in the earth, and become concentrated as a result of human activities, or, in some cases geochemical processes, such as accumulation in peat soils that are then released when drained for agriculture. Common sources include fertilisers; aging water supply infrastructure; and microplastics floating in the world&#x27;s oceans. Arsenic is thought to be used in connection with coloring dyes. Rat poison used in grain and mash stores may be another source of the arsenic.

The geographical extent of sources may be very large. For example, up to one-sixth of China&#x27;s arable land might be affected by heavy metal contamination. 

Lead is the most prevalent heavy metal contaminant. As a component of tetraethyl lead, , it was used extensively in gasoline during the 1930s–1970s. Lead levels in the aquatic environments of industrialised societies have been estimated to be two to three times those of pre-industrial levels. Although the use of leaded gasoline was largely phased out in North America by 1996, soils next to roads built before this time retain high lead concentrations. Lead (from lead(II) azide or lead styphnate used in firearms) gradually accumulates at firearms training grounds, contaminating the local environment and exposing range employees to a risk of lead poisoning.

== Entry routes ==

Toxic metals enter plant, animal and human tissues via air inhalation, diet, and manual handling. Welding, galvanizing, brazing, and soldering exposes workers to fumes that may be inhaled and result in metal fume fever. Motor vehicle emissions are a major source of airborne contaminants including arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, nickel, lead, antimony, vanadium, zinc, platinum, palladium and rhodium. Water sources (groundwater, lakes, streams and rivers) can be polluted by toxic metals leaching from industrial and consumer waste; acid rain can exacerbate this process by releasing toxic metals trapped in soils. Transport through soil can be facilitated by the presence of preferential flow paths (macropores) and dissolved organic compounds. Plants are exposed to toxic metals through the uptake of water; animals eat these plants; ingestion of plant- and animal-based foods are the largest sources of toxic metals in humans. Absorption through skin contact, for example from contact with soil, or metal containing toys and jewelry, is another potential source of toxic metal contamination. Toxic metals can bioaccumulate in organisms as they are hard to metabolize.

== Detrimental effects ==
Toxic metals &quot;can bind to vital cellular components, such as structural proteins, enzymes, and nucleic acids, and interfere with their functioning&quot;. Symptoms and effects can vary according to the metal or metal compound, and the dose involved. Broadly, long-term exposure to toxic heavy metals can have carcinogenic, central and peripheral nervous system, and circulatory effects. For humans, typical presentations associated with exposure to any of the &quot;classical&quot; toxic heavy metals, or chromium (another toxic heavy metal) or arsenic (a metalloid), are shown in the table.

== History ==

The toxic effects of arsenic, mercury and lead were known to the ancients but methodical studies of the overall toxicity of heavy metals appear to date from only 1868. In that year, Wanklyn and Chapman speculated on the adverse effects of the heavy metals &quot;arsenic, lead, copper, zinc, iron and manganese&quot; in drinking water. They noted an &quot;absence of investigation&quot; and were reduced to &quot;the necessity of pleading for the collection of data&quot;. In 1884, Blake described an apparent connection between toxicity and the atomic weight of an element. The following sections provide historical thumbnails for the &quot;classical&quot; toxic heavy metals (arsenic, mercury and lead) and some more recent examples (chromium and cadmium).

=== Arsenic ===


Arsenic, as realgar () and orpiment (), was known in ancient times. Strabo (64–50 BCE – c. AD 24?), a Greek geographer and historian, wrote that only slaves were employed in realgar and orpiment mines since they would inevitably die from the toxic effects of the fumes given off from the ores. Arsenic-contaminated beer poisoned over 6,000 people in the Manchester area of England in 1900, and is thought to have killed at least 70 victims. Clare Luce, American ambassador to Italy from 1953 to 1956, suffered from arsenic poisoning. Its source was traced to flaking arsenic-laden paint on the ceiling of her bedroom. She may also have eaten food contaminated by arsenic in flaking ceiling paint in the embassy dining room. Ground water contaminated by arsenic, as of 2014, &quot;is still poisoning millions of people in Asia&quot;.

=== Mercury ===

The first emperor of unified China, Qin Shi Huang, it is reported, died of ingesting mercury pills that were intended to give him eternal life. The phrase &quot;mad as a hatter&quot; is likely a reference to mercury poisoning among milliners (so-called &quot;mad hatter disease&quot;), as mercury-based compounds were once used in the manufacture of felt hats in the 18th and 19th century. Historically, gold amalgam (an alloy with mercury) was widely used in gilding, leading to numerous casualties among the workers. It is estimated that during the construction of Saint Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral alone, 60 workers died from the gilding of the main dome. Outbreaks of methylmercury poisoning occurred in several places in Japan during the 1950s due to industrial discharges of mercury into rivers and coastal waters. The best-known instances were in Minamata and Niigata. In Minamata alone, more than 600 people died due to what became known as Minamata disease. More than 21,000 people filed claims with the Japanese government, of which almost 3000 became certified as having the disease. In 22 documented cases, pregnant women who consumed contaminated fish showed mild or no symptoms but gave birth to infants with severe developmental disabilities. Since the Industrial Revolution, mercury levels have tripled in many near-surface seawaters, especially around Iceland and Antarctica.

=== Lead ===


The adverse effects of lead were known to the ancients. In the 2nd century BC the Greek botanist Nicander described the colic and paralysis seen in lead-poisoned people. Dioscorides, a Greek physician who is thought to have lived in the 1st century CE, wrote that lead &quot;makes the mind give way&quot;. Lead was used extensively in Roman aqueducts from about 500 BC to 300 AD. Julius Caesar&#x27;s engineer, Vitruvius, reported, &quot;water is much more wholesome from earthenware pipes than from lead pipes. For it seems to be made injurious by lead, because white lead is produced by it, and this is said to be harmful to the human body.&quot; During the Mongol period in China (1271−1368 AD), lead pollution due to silver smelting in the Yunnan region exceeded contamination levels from modern mining activities by nearly four times. In the 17th and 18th centuries, people in Devon were afflicted by a condition referred to as Devon colic; this was discovered to be due to the imbibing of lead-contaminated cider. In 2013, the World Health Organization estimated that lead poisoning resulted in 143,000 deaths, and &quot;contribute[d] to 600,000 new cases of children with intellectual disabilities&quot;, each year. In the U.S. city of Flint, Michigan, lead contamination in drinking water has been an issue since 2014. The source of the contamination has been attributed to &quot;corrosion in the lead and iron pipes that distribute water to city residents&quot;. In 2015, the lead concentration of drinking water in north-eastern Tasmania, Australia, reached a level over 50 times the prescribed national drinking water guidelines. The source of the contamination was attributed to &quot;a combination of dilapidated drinking water infrastructure, including lead jointed pipelines, end-of-life polyvinyl chloride pipes and household plumbing&quot;.

=== Chromium ===
Chromium(III) compounds and chromium metal are not considered a health hazard, while the toxicity and carcinogenic properties of chromium(VI) have been known since at least the late 19th century. In 1890, Newman described the elevated cancer risk of workers in a chromate dye company. Chromate-induced dermatitis was reported in aircraft workers during World War II. In 1963, an outbreak of dermatitis, ranging from erythema to exudative eczema, occurred amongst 60 automobile factory workers in England. The workers had been wet-sanding chromate-based primer paint that had been applied to car bodies. In Australia, chromium was released from the Newcastle Orica explosives plant on August 8, 2011. Up to 20 workers at the plant were exposed as were 70 nearby homes in Stockton. The town was only notified three days after the release and the accident sparked a major public controversy, with Orica criticised for playing down the extent and possible risks of the leak, and the state Government attacked for their slow response to the incident.

=== Cadmium ===


Cadmium exposure is a phenomenon of the early 20th century, and onwards. In Japan in 1910, the Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting Company began discharging cadmium into the Jinzū River, as a byproduct of mining operations. Residents in the surrounding area subsequently consumed rice grown in cadmium-contaminated irrigation water. They experienced softening of the bones and kidney failure. The origin of these symptoms was not clear; possibilities raised at the time included &quot;a regional or bacterial disease or lead poisoning&quot;. In 1955, cadmium was identified as the likely cause and in 1961 the source was directly linked to mining operations in the area. In February 2010, cadmium was found in Walmart exclusive Miley Cyrus jewelry. Wal-Mart continued to sell the jewelry until May, when covert testing organised by Associated Press confirmed the original results. In June 2010 cadmium was detected in the paint used on promotional drinking glasses for the movie &quot;Shrek Forever After&quot;, sold by McDonald&#x27;s Restaurants, triggering a recall of 12 million glasses.

== Remediation ==
===Human===


In humans, heavy metal poisoning is generally treated by the administration of chelating agents. These are chemical compounds, such as (calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate) that convert heavy metals to chemically inert forms that can be excreted without further interaction with the body. Chelates are not without side effects and can also remove beneficial metals from the body. Vitamin and mineral supplements are sometimes co-administered for this reason

===Environment===
Soils contaminated by heavy metals can be remediated by one or more of the following technologies: isolation; immobilization; toxicity reduction; physical separation; or extraction. &quot;Isolation&quot; involves the use of caps, membranes or below-ground barriers in an attempt to quarantine the contaminated soil. &quot;Immobilization&quot; aims to alter the properties of the soil so as to hinder the mobility of the heavy contaminants. &quot;Toxicity reduction&quot; attempts to oxidise or reduce the toxic heavy metal ions, via chemical or biological means into less toxic or mobile forms. &quot;Physical separation&quot; involves the removal of the contaminated soil and the separation of the metal contaminants by mechanical means. &quot;Extraction&quot; is an on or off-site process that uses chemicals, high-temperature volatization, or electrolysis to extract contaminants from soils. The process or processes used will vary according to contaminant and the characteristics of the site.

== Benefits ==

Some elements otherwise regarded as toxic heavy metals are essential, in small quantities, for human health. These elements include vanadium, manganese, iron, cobalt, copper, zinc, selenium, strontium and molybdenum. A deficiency of these essential metals may increase susceptibility to heavy metal poisoning.

Selenium is the most toxic of the heavy metals that are essential for mammals. Selenium is normally excreted and only becomes toxic when the intake exceeds the excretory capacity.

<text>The PJSC Beriev Aircraft Company (), formerly Beriev Design Bureau, is a Russian aircraft manufacturer (design office prefix Be), specializing in amphibious aircraft.

The company was founded in Taganrog in 1934 as OKB-49 by Georgy Mikhailovich Beriev, and since that time has designed and produced more than 20 different models of aircraft for civilian and military purposes, as well as customized models. Today the company employs some 3000 specialists and is developing and manufacturing amphibious aircraft.

Pilots flying Beriev seaplanes have broken 228 world aviation records, which are registered and acknowledged by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale.

==History==
Georgy Mikhailovich Beriev founded the design bureau that bears his name at Taganrog in 1932. The traditional focus of the Beriyev Design Bureau has been the development of seaplanes for military and civilian use. The Bureau was moved to Krasnoyarsk in Siberia in 1942 to avoid destruction in World War II, and returned to Taganrog in 1945. In November 1989, Beriev became the only defense industry enterprise to win the Prize for Quality awarded by the Soviet Government.

<text>Aermacchi was an Italian aircraft manufacturer. Formerly known as Aeronautica Macchi, the company was founded in 1912 by Giulio Macchi at Varese in north-western Lombardy as Nieuport-Macchi, to build Nieuport monoplanes under licence for the Italian military. With a factory located on the shores of Lake Varese, the firm originally manufactured a series of Nieuport designs, as well as seaplanes.

After World War II, the company began producing motorcycles as a way to fill the post-war need for cheap, efficient transportation.

The company later specialised in civil and military pilot training aircraft. In July 2003, Aermacchi was integrated into the Finmeccanica Group (now Leonardo) as Alenia Aermacchi, which increased its shareholding to 99%.

==Military trainers==


Since the beginning, the design and production of military trainers have been the core business of Alenia Aermacchi.

The products include: 
* SF-260, piston-engined or turboprop-powered screener/primary trainer
* MB-326, turbojet engined trainer and light attack aircraft
* M-311, basic turbofan trainer
* MB-339CD, advanced and lead-in fighter trainer
* M-346, advanced and lead-in fighter trainer of the new generation

==Military collaboration==
Alenia Aermacchi has cooperated in international military programs:

* AMX program:
Alenia Aermacchi takes part in the AMX program with Alenia Aeronautica and Embraer of Brazil with a total share of 24%. Alenia Aermacchi develops and manufactures the fuselage forward and rear sections and installs some avionic equipment in the aircraft. A Mid-Life Updating program is required by the Italian Air Force to upgrade the aircraft capabilities.

* Panavia Tornado program:
Alenia Aermacchi designs and produces wing pylons and wing tips, roots, trailing edges and flaps, which represents a 5% share in the overall program.

* Eurofighter program:
Alenia Aermacchi has a share of more than 4% in the Eurofighter program, for the design and development of wing pylons, twin missile and twin store carriers, ECM pods, carbon fiber structures and titanium engine cowlings.

* C-27J program:
After participating in the G-222 transport aircraft program, the company is involved in the new Military Transport Aircraft C-27J Spartan, for the production of outer wings.

==Civil programs==

Since the mid-1990s, Alenia Aermacchi has participated in programs for the supply of engine nacelles for civil aircraft. It produces cold parts for engine nacelles: inlets, fan cowls and EBU, the systems-to-engine interface. 
In 1999, the company established a joint venture (MHD) with Hurel-Dubois (presently Hurel-Hispano, of SNECMA group). It is a French company specializing in the development and manufacture of thrust reversers, to obtain the full responsibility for the development of nacelles installed on maximum 100-seat aircraft.

==Motorcycles==
=== 1950s ===
Aermacchi began producing motorcycles in c. 1951; the first Aermacchi to be marketed to the public was a scooter/motorcycle hybrid called the &#x27;Convertible&#x27;, with the majority of working parts semi-enclosed, an under-saddle engine and foot boards, a conventional motorcycle fuel tank position and wheels. 

It was succeeded in 1953 by the &#x27;Zeffiro&#x27; which was offered with a 125 cc or 150 cc two-stroke engine; these later models had upgraded suspension but remained similar in appearance. 

In 1955, they produced the 125 cc Monsone, followed by the 150 cc Corsaro, both of which had pivoted fork rear suspension and telescopic front forks. They were two-strokes like the early models and ran a 4-speed gearbox. 

In 1956 they produced their first over head valve four-stroke engine on the Chimera fitted horizontally, a layout which would become a standard for the marque. Similar to their first offering, the Chimera kept many enclosed working parts. 

In 1957 they released a series of sport models, powered by a single cylinder ohv engine in 175 cc or 250 cc displacements. Aermacchi continued with scooter production, but sales were poor and they were unable to compete in the market amongst the well established Vespas and Lambrettas, and concentrated solely on the production of motorcycles.

=== 1960s and beyond ===

In 1960, US business Harley-Davidson motorcycles purchased 50% of Aermacchi&#x27;s motorcycle division. The Italian branch of the brand was named &#x27;Aermacchi-Harley-Davidson&#x27; and the first bike was a variation of the &#x27;Ala Verde&#x27; suitably modified for the American market. This was also the year that the Chimera ceased production. 

The remaining motorcycle holdings were sold in 1974 to AMF-Harley-Davidson, with motorcycles continuing to be made at Varese. 

The business was sold to Cagiva in 1978.

=== Racing History ===
After the Harley Davidson investment, Aermacchi branched out into racing with a 250 cc production-volume Ala d&#x27;Oro for road racing competition. Early results varied but over years of bike development the team placed third during the 1966 350 cc World Championship with racer Renzo Pasolini and third again in 1968 with Kelvin Carruthers. The following year Carruthers competed at the Isle of Man TT. 

A new era began in 1971 with the development of twin-cylinder two-stroke racers of 250cc and 350cc capacity, designed at Aermacchi by their chief engineer, Ing. William Soncini. The first 250cc racer was very fast, with 46hp at 11,000rpm, and weighed only 250lbs. After Harley-Davidson acquired 100% of Aermacchi in 1972, they funded further racing development at the Aermacchi factory, and the racers were branded with Harley-Davidson on their fuel tanks. These two-stroke twins provided Harley-Davidson with their only Grand Prix wins, and four World Championships: 250cc World Championship in 1974, &#x27;75, and &#x27;76, and the 350cc World Championship in 1976, all under rider Walter Villa.

<text>Blackburn Aircraft Limited was a British aircraft manufacturer from 1914 to 1963 that concentrated mainly on naval and maritime aircraft.

==History==
Blackburn Aircraft was founded by Robert Blackburn and Jessy Blackburn, who built his first aircraft in Leeds in 1908 with the company&#x27;s Olympia Works at Roundhay opening in 1914.

The Blackburn Aeroplane &amp; Motor Company was created in 1914 and established in a new factory at Brough, East Riding of Yorkshire in 1916. Robert&#x27;s brother Norman Blackburn later became managing director.

Blackburn acquired the Cirrus-Hermes Engineering company in 1934, beginning its manufacture of aircraft engines. However an updated range of engines was under development and Blackburn wanted to wait until it was established before giving its name to them, so Cirrus Hermes Engineering was retained as a separate company for the time being.

The company&#x27;s name was changed to Blackburn Aircraft Limited in 1936.

In 1937, with the new Cirrus engines now well established, engine manufacturing was brought into the parent company as an operating division, giving rise to the Blackburn Cirrus name.

By 1937, pressure to re-arm was growing and the Yorkshire factory was approaching capacity. A fortuitous friendship between Maurice Denny, managing director of William Denny and Brothers, the Dumbarton ship building company, and Robert Blackburn resulted in the building of a new Blackburn factory at Barge Park, Dumbarton where production of the Blackburn Botha commenced in 1939.

Blackburn amalgamated with General Aircraft Limited in 1949 as Blackburn and General Aircraft Limited, reverting to Blackburn Aircraft Limited by 1958.

As part of the rationalisation of British aircraft manufacturers, its aircraft production and engine operations were absorbed into Hawker Siddeley and Bristol Siddeley respectively in 1960/1961. The Blackburn name was dropped completely in 1963.

An American company, Blackburn Aircraft Corp., was incorporated in Detroit on 20 May 1929 to acquire design and patent rights of the aircraft of Blackburn Airplane &amp; Motor Co., Ltd. in the USA. It was owned 90% by Detroit Aircraft Corp. and 10% by Blackburn Airplane &amp; Motor Co., Ltd. Agreements covered such rights in North and South America, excepting Brazil and certain rights in Canada and provided that all special tools and patterns were to be supplied by the UK company at cost.

===Locations===
The company had factories at Olympia in Leeds, Sherburn-in-Elmet, Brough (East Yorkshire) and Dumbarton. In the early days, Blackburn himself flew aircraft on the beaches at Marske and Filey, with the company also using the former RAF Holme-on-Spalding Moor. Before production shifted to Sherburn-in-Elmet and Brough from the Leeds site, aircraft were flown in and out of Olympia works by an adjacent airstrip in Roundhay Park.

<text>Data is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. He appears in the television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (&quot;TNG&quot;), the first and third seasons of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, and the fifth season of &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot;; and the feature films &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; (1994), &quot;First Contact&quot; (1996), &quot;Insurrection&quot; (1998), and &quot;Nemesis&quot; (2002). Data is portrayed by actor Brent Spiner.

Data is a self-aware, sapient, sentient and anatomically fully functional male android who serves as the second officer and chief operations officer aboard the Federation starship USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D and later the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E.

Data is in many ways a successor to the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s Spock, in that the character has superior mental skills and offers an &quot;outsider&#x27;s&quot; perspective on humanity.

==Development==
Gene Roddenberry told Brent Spiner that over the course of the series, Data was to become &quot;more and more like a human until the end of the show, when he would be very close, but still not quite there. That was the idea and that&#x27;s the way that the writers took it.&quot; Spiner felt that Data exhibited the Chaplinesque characteristics of a sad, tragic clown. To get into his role as Data, Spiner used the character of Robby the Robot from the film &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; as a role model.

Commenting on Data&#x27;s perpetual albino-like appearance, he said: &quot;I spent more hours of the day in make-up than out of make-up&quot;, so much so that he even called it a way of method acting. Spiner also portrayed Data&#x27;s manipulative and malevolent brother Lore (a role he found much easier to play, because the character was &quot;more like me&quot;), and Data&#x27;s creator, Dr. Noonien Soong. Additionally, he portrayed another Soong-type android, B-4, in the film &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;, and also Arik Soong, one of Soong&#x27;s ancestors in three episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;. Spiner said his favorite Data scene takes place in &quot;Descent&quot;, when Data plays poker on the holodeck with a re-creation of the famous physicist Stephen Hawking, played by Hawking himself.

Spiner reprised his role of Data in the &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; series finale &quot;These Are the Voyages...&quot; in an off-screen speaking part. Spiner felt that he had visibly aged out of the role and that Data was best presented as a youthful figure. Spiner returned to the role for 2020 &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, having been convinced by the advent of digital de-aging tools. He also accepted because the negative fan reaction to the death of Data in &quot;Nemesis&quot; took him by surprise, and the scene in &quot;Picard&quot; gave a new opportunity for a proper sendoff to the character. Initially stating that the 2020 first season of &quot;Picard&quot; would be his final time playing Data, Spiner returned to the role for the series&#x27; 2023 third and final season, portraying an aged Data, Lore, and B-4.

==Depiction==
===Biography===
Data was found by Starfleet in 2338. He was the sole survivor on Omicron Theta in the rubble of a colony left after an attack from the Crystalline Entity. He is a synthetic life form with artificial intelligence, designed and built by Doctor Noonien Soong in his own likeness (likewise portrayed by Spiner). 

His positronic brain allows him impressive computational capabilities. He experienced ongoing difficulties during the early years of his life with understanding various aspects of human behavior and was unable to feel emotion or understand certain human idiosyncrasies, inspiring him to strive for his own humanity. This goal eventually led to the addition of an &quot;emotion chip&quot;, created by Soong, to Data&#x27;s positronic net. Although Data&#x27;s endeavor to increase his humanity and desire for human emotional experience is a significant plot point (and source of humor) throughout the series, he consistently shows a nuanced sense of wisdom, sensitivity and curiosity, garnering respect from his peers and colleagues.

Dialog in &quot;Datalore&quot; establishes some of Data&#x27;s backstory. It is stated that he was deactivated in 2336 on Omicron Theta before an attack by the Crystalline Entity, a spaceborne creature which converts life forms to energy for sustenance. He was found and reactivated by Starfleet personnel two years later. Data went to Starfleet Academy from 2341 to 2345 (he describes himself as &quot;Class of &#x27;78&quot; to Commander William Riker in the series premiere &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;—with &quot;honors in probability mechanics and exobiology&quot;, although canonically may only refer to the stardate) and then served in Starfleet aboard the USS &quot;Trieste&quot;. He was assigned to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; under Captain Jean-Luc Picard in 2364. In &quot;Datalore&quot;, Data discovers his amoral brother, Lore, and learns that Dr. Noonien Soong created Data after Lore. Lore fails in an attempt to betray the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to the Crystalline Entity, and Wesley Crusher beams Data&#x27;s brother into space at the episode&#x27;s conclusion. Lore claimed that Data was &quot;less-perfect&quot;, which was a lie, as Soong later confirmed to Data in &quot;Brothers&quot;; the only real difference between the two of them &quot;was some programming&quot; (Lore&#x27;s positronic net differed from Data&#x27;s: it had a Type-&quot;L&quot; phase discriminator compared to Data&#x27;s Type-&quot;R&quot;; see episode &quot;Time&#x27;s Arrow&quot;).

===Television series and films===
It was in the Star Trek prequel &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; episode &quot;The Augments&quot; that the origin of Data can be traced back to a scientific theory created by genetic engineer Arik Soong, ancestor to Data&#x27;s &quot;father / creator&quot; Noonien Soong, who noted that his theory would take generations beyond his lifetime to develop into a practical working model. Arik Soong created the theory while serving life imprisonment for recreating the discontinued &quot;Augments&quot; program which originally started the Eugenics War of the late 20th century. This links the Data storyline to that of Khan Noonien Singh from the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;. 

In &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot;, a Starfleet judge rules that Data is not Starfleet property.

Data&#x27;s family is expanded in &quot;The Offspring&quot;, which introduces Lal, a gynoid based on Data&#x27;s neural interface and whom Data refers to as his daughter. Lal &quot;dies&quot; shortly after activation. In &quot;Brothers&quot;, Data reunites with Dr. Soong. There he meets again with Lore, who steals the emotion chip Soong meant for Data to receive. Lore then fatally wounds Soong. In &quot;Descent&quot;, Lore returns, using the emotion chip to control Data and make him help with Lore&#x27;s attempt to make the Borg entirely artificial lifeforms. Data eventually deactivates Lore, and recovers, but does not install the damaged emotion chip. In &quot;Inheritance&quot;, Soong&#x27;s former wife Juliana reunites with Data, though the crew discovers she was a gynoid duplicate built by Soong after the real Julianna&#x27;s death, programmed to die after a long life, and to believe she is the true Julianna unaware of the fact she is an android. Faced with the decision, Data chooses not to disclose this to her and allows her to continue her normal life.

In &quot;All Good Things...&quot;, the two-hour series finale of &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, Captain Picard travels among three different time periods. The Picard of 25 years into the future goes with Geordi La Forge to seek advice from now Professor Data, a luminary physicist who holds the Lucasian Chair at Cambridge University.

In the film &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot;, Data finally installs the emotion chip he retrieved from Lore, and experiences the full scope of emotions. However, those emotions proved difficult to control and Data struggled to master them. In &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;, Data has managed to gain complete control of the chip, which includes deactivating it to maintain his performance efficiency. In the film &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;, Data beams Picard off an enemy ship before destroying it, sacrificing himself and saving the captain and crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. However, Data had copied his core memories into B-4, his lost brother who is introduced in the movie. This was done with the reluctant help of La Forge, who voiced concerns about how this could cause B-4 to be nothing more than an exact duplicate of Data.

In the first season of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, Data is seen in Picard&#x27;s dreams, playing poker with him in Ten-Forward, and later painting in the middle of the vineyards of Chateau Picard. It is revealed that Dahj and Soji Asha are Data&#x27;s daughters, created through fractal neuronic cloning, a procedure developed by Dr. Bruce Maddox. These neurons were apparently salvaged from B-4, who had been dismantled and placed in storage after his positronic net was found to be too primitive to integrate Data&#x27;s memories. However, Data&#x27;s consciousness is revealed to still exist inside a quantum simulation crafted by Maddox and based upon memories retrieved from the neurons Maddox salvaged from B-4, the equipment holding the network now in the possession of Altan Soong, Noonien Soong&#x27;s biological son. After Picard dies, Altan Soong transfers Picard&#x27;s consciousness into a golem intended for his own consciousness and Picard meets with Data inside the simulation. Data requests that Picard terminate his consciousness, which would allow Data the experience of dying, believing that he could only truly &quot;live&quot; if he had a finite lifespan. Once Picard awakens, he carries out Data&#x27;s wish and Data&#x27;s consciousness rapidly ages to death, Picard giving a brief eulogy as he observes that what made Data remarkable was his ability to see humanity&#x27;s worst traits and still aspire to the best parts of the human condition.

In the third season of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, Data is revealed to have been revived by Altan within a new synthetic body, having partially merged with Lore, B-4, and the memories of Altan Soong himself. It&#x27;s believed by Riker that while Data&#x27;s memories had previously been unrecoverable, the lifting of the ban on synthetics had allowed Soong to work on it more and properly extract them from B-4. The new android was requisitioned by the Daystrom Institute, Starfleet&#x27;s foremost advanced research center. Riker, Worf, and Raffi Musiker steal the android, and bring him aboard the USS &quot;Titan&quot;, where he is reunited with Picard. The android entity holds valuable information on Daystrom&#x27;s research projects, and Data&#x27;s persona reveals that the antagonists of the season have stolen Picard&#x27;s original dead organic body. However, it takes several hours for La Forge to re-engineer the android to allow Data&#x27;s persona to truly dominate it, with Lore&#x27;s persona dominating in the meantime. Data&#x27;s persona is seemingly unable to overpower Lore who has taken over the &quot;Titan&quot;″s systems, but upon realizing that Lore envied the compassion and empathy Data developed from his memories, Data eventually surrenders them to Lore. Lore initially regards them as his battle trophies; they consume him, reintegrating Lore and reconstituting Data, allowing him to fully take over the new body and reprogram the &quot;Titan&quot; systems against the Changelings. Data&#x27;s personality is thus newly enriched, and attains its most human-like state with Data stating that he is Data, but also Lore, B-4, Lal and everything else that Soong had programmed into the android.

In the series final episodes, the Changelings are revealed to be working with the Borg who take over Starfleet. Data plays an instrumental role in the final defeat of the Borg, piloting the rebuilt USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D to the heart of a Borg cube over Jupiter on a gut feeling, a feat that La Forge had believed to be impossible for even a computer or the best pilot to accomplish. Afterwards, Data attempts to adjust to having an artificial organic body and everything that comes with it and is last seen playing poker with his &quot;Enterprise&quot; crewmates at the Ten Forward bar in Los Angeles.

In &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; season 5&#x27;s &quot;Fully Dilated,&quot; an alternate universe version of Data gets trapped in the prime universe. This version of Data, who is purple, is still active in 2382 rather than having been destroyed years earlier and serves on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D which is similarly still intact. The alternate Data is shown to share many of his prime counterpart&#x27;s traits and even some of his experiences, such as a close friendship with Geordi La Forge and getting trapped in 19th century San Francisco. After the &quot;Enterprise&quot; briefly crosses into the prime universe via a mysterious interdimensional rift &quot;while battling some evil clones of Tasha Yar, or something,&quot; Data is left behind and his shuttle crashes on Dilmer III, a pre-industrial planet experiencing time dilation. Data&#x27;s head -- the only part of his body to survive -- is recovered by Starfleet lieutenants Beckett Mariner, D&#x27;Vana Tendi, and T&#x27;Lyn, but a transporter mishap strands them on the planet for a year of relative time. During this period, Tendi finds a way to power Data&#x27;s head and reactivate him and he provides her with advice and help with her science. Data is eventually beamed to the USS &quot;Cerritos&quot; where he recommends both Tendi and T&#x27;Lyn for the open senior science officer position. The crew load Data&#x27;s head into a torpedo casing and fire it back through the rift to be recovered by the &quot;Enterprise&quot; on the other side.

===Spot===

Spot is Data&#x27;s pet cat and a recurring character in the show. Spot appears in several episodes during &quot;TNG&quot;″s last four seasons, as well as in the feature films &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;. She first appears in the episode &quot;Data&#x27;s Day&quot;. Spot originally appears as a male Somali cat, but later appears as a female orange tabby cat, eventually giving birth to kittens (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;Genesis&quot;). In &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, his memories of Spot are the last ones that Data &quot;surrenders&quot; to Lore.

==Popular culture==
Like Spock, Data became a sex symbol and Spiner&#x27;s fan mail came mostly from women. He described the letters as &quot;romantic mail&quot; that were &quot;really written to Data; he&#x27;s a really accessible personality&quot;.

Robotics engineers regard Data (along with the droids from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies) as the pre-eminent face of robots in the public&#x27;s perception of their field. On April 9, 2008, Data was inducted into Carnegie Mellon University&#x27;s Robot Hall of Fame during a ceremony at the Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Spiner himself released an album of old pop standards from the 1930s and &#x27;40s entitled &quot;Ol&#x27; Yellow Eyes Is Back&quot;, a reference to the contact lenses he wore as Data, as well as a play on the name of the Frank Sinatra album, &quot;Ol&quot;&#x27; &quot;Blue&quot; &quot;Eyes Is&quot; &quot;Back&quot;.

<text>Hawker Pacific Aerospace (HPA) is an aircraft maintenance company which offers landing gear and hydraulic maintenance, repair and overhaul services for all major aircraft types, including all current Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier and Embraer models, as well as helicopters.

Lufthansa Technik (LHT), a subsidiary of Lufthansa German Airlines, acquired Hawker Pacific in 2002. Within the LHT network, Hawker is able to provide an around the world landing gear service.

HPA&#x27;s corporate headquarters are located in Sun Valley, Los Angeles, California, near to Bob Hope Burbank International Airport.

==History==
Hawker Pacific Aerospace was formed in 1980. In 1991, Hawker Siddeley was absorbed by BTR Aerospace Group. In 1994, Hawker Pacific merged with Dunlop Aviation Inc and in 1996, Hawker Pacific Aerospace was sold by BTR and became a stand-alone company.

In 1998, Hawker Pacific completed its initial public offering of common stock and used the proceeds to acquire the landing gear, flap track and flap carriage operation from British Airways.

In 2002, Lufthansa Technik acquired 100% ownership of Hawker Pacific Aerospace including its UK location. Hawker was added to Lufthansa Technik&#x27;s Landing Gear Division to form a global network for landing gear maintenance, repair and operations services.

In January 2011, Hawker Pacific Aerospace UK was sold to Lufthansa Technik and renamed into Lufthansa Technik Landing Gear Services UK.

==Business divisions==

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Byzantine Empire ====
* Emperor Maurice refuses to pay ransom for 12,000 Byzantine soldiers taken prisoner by the Avars. Their leader Bayan I orders the execution of the prisoners, and slaughters them all. His failure to buy back the captives destroys Maurice&#x27;s popularity with the Byzantine troops in the Balkan Peninsula.
* Summer – Balkan Campaign: The Byzantine generals Priscus and Comentiolus join their forces at Singidunum (modern Belgrade), and move downstream to the fortress city of Viminacium (Serbia). The Byzantines cross the Danube River and invade Upper Moesia, where they defeat the Avars in open battle. 
* Priscus pursues the fleeing Avar tribes and invades their homeland in Pannonia. He devastates the land east of the Tisza River, deciding the war for the Byzantines and ending the Avar and Slavic incursions across the Danube. 
* Autumn – Comentiolus reopens the Gate of Trajan pass, near Ihtiman (Bulgaria). This strategic mountain pass, whose fortress &quot;Stipon&quot; defends the border between the provinces Thrace and Macedonia, is not used for decades.

==== Europe ====
* Callinicus, governor (&quot;exarch&quot;) of Ravenna, repulses attacks of the South Slavs in Istria (Croatia). The region is pillaged, but the Byzantines drive them all out. 
* Callinicus breaks the truce by kidnapping the Lombard daughter of King Agilulf, beginning a war with the Exarchate of Ravenna (approximate date).

==== Britain ====

* Rædwald becomes king (&quot;bretwalda&quot;) of East Anglia (East of England), under the overlordship of Æthelberht of Kent (according to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;).

==== Persia ====
* King Khosrau II sends a Persian expedition to South Arabia and conquers Yemen. He establishes a military base to control the sea trade with the East (approximate date).

==== Asia ====
* Tardu declares himself to be ruler (&quot;khagan&quot;) of the united Turkic Khaganate (east and west). His new status is not recognised widely in the empire.
* Beop becomes king of the Korean kingdom of Baekje.

==== Mesoamerica ====
* The Maya city of Palenque (southern Mexico) is plundered by King Scroll Serpent of Calakmul (approximate date).

=== By topic ===

==== Religion ====
* Venantius Fortunatus, Latin poet and hymnodist in the Merovingian court, is appointed bishop of Poitiers.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* January 23 – Tai Zong, emperor of the Tang dynasty (d. 649)

== Deaths ==
* Anastasius I, patriarch of Antioch
* Hye, king of Baekje (Korea)
* Taliesin, Brythonic poet (approximate date)
* Tulan Qaghan, ruler (&quot;khagan&quot;) of the Göktürks

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Byzantine Empire ====
* March 30 – Balkan Campaign: The Avars lift the siege of the fortress city of Tomis (modern Romania). A Byzantine army under Comentiolus crosses the Balkan Mountains, and marches along the Danube River to Zikidiba.
* The Avars rout the Byzantine forces of Comentiolus (south of Haemus Mons), and capture Drizipera (Thrace). A large part of their troops are killed by the plague, after many cities are devastated in the Balkan Peninsula.
* Emperor Maurice pays tribute to the Avars and concludes a treaty with their leader Bayan I, allowing Byzantine expeditions in Wallachia. He reorganises his army and strengthens the Long Walls (west of Constantinople).

==== Europe ====
* Maurice makes peace with King Agilulf, conceding northern Italy. Pope Gregory I the Great negotiates a truce, ending 30 years of Lombard terror. Agilulf expands the Lombard Kingdom by occupying Sutri and Perugia.

==== Britain ====
* Battle of Catraeth: The Gododdin under Mynyddog Mwynfawr, Brythonic king of Hen Ogledd (&quot;The Old North&quot;), defeat the Angles of Bernicia and Deira, at the stronghold of Catraeth in Northern England (approximate date).

==== Asia ====
* August 4 – Goguryeo War: Emperor Wéndi orders his youngest son, Yang Liang (assisted by the co-prime minister Gao Jiong), to conquer Goguryeo (Korea) during the rainy season, with a Chinese army (300,000 men). 
* The Chinese fleet engages in battle against the Goguryeo fleet (50,000 men) under Admiral Kang I-sik, and is destroyed in the Bohai Sea. During the invasion the Sui forces are all defeated, and Yang Liang is forced to retreat.
* King Yeongyang sends an embassy to Daxing; Wéndi accepts a peace agreement with Goguryeo. He claims a hollow victory, as the Sui dynasty lost nearly 90% of his army and navy during the disastrous campaign.
* Hye becomes king of the Korean kingdom of Baekje.

=== By topic ===

==== Religion ====
* Missionaries begin to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity throughout much of what will later be the British Isles (approximate date).
* The Guoqing Temple is built on Mount Tiantai (Zhejiang), and becomes the site for the teachings of Chinese Buddhism.

<text>Cosmic rays or astroparticles are high-energy particles or clusters of particles (primarily represented by protons or atomic nuclei) that move through space at nearly the speed of light. They originate from the Sun, from outside of the Solar System in our own galaxy, and from distant galaxies. Upon impact with Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, cosmic rays produce showers of secondary particles, some of which reach the surface, although the bulk are deflected off into space by the magnetosphere or the heliosphere.

Cosmic rays were discovered by Victor Hess in 1912 in balloon experiments, for which he was awarded the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics.

Direct measurement of cosmic rays, especially at lower energies, has been possible since the launch of the first satellites in the late 1950s. Particle detectors similar to those used in nuclear and high-energy physics are used on satellites and space probes for research into cosmic rays.
Data from the Fermi Space Telescope (2013) have been interpreted as evidence that a significant fraction of primary cosmic rays originate from the supernova explosions of stars. Based on observations of neutrinos and gamma rays from blazar TXS 0506+056 in 2018, active galactic nuclei also appear to produce cosmic rays.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;ray&quot; (as in optical ray) seems to have arisen from an initial belief, due to their penetrating power, that cosmic rays were mostly electromagnetic radiation. Nevertheless, following wider recognition of cosmic rays as being various high-energy particles with intrinsic mass, the term &quot;rays&quot; was still consistent with then known particles such as cathode rays, canal rays, alpha rays, and beta rays. Meanwhile &quot;cosmic&quot; ray photons, which are quanta of electromagnetic radiation (and so have no intrinsic mass) are known by their common names, such as &quot;gamma rays&quot; or &quot;X-rays&quot;, depending on their photon energy.

==Composition==
Of primary cosmic rays, which originate outside of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, about 99% are the bare nuclei of common atoms (stripped of their electron shells), and about 1% are solitary electrons (that is, one type of beta particle). Of the nuclei, about 90% are simple protons (i.e., hydrogen nuclei); 9% are alpha particles, identical to helium nuclei; and 1% are the nuclei of heavier elements, called HZE ions. These fractions vary highly over the energy range of cosmic rays. A very small fraction are stable particles of antimatter, such as positrons or antiprotons. The precise nature of this remaining fraction is an area of active research. An active search from Earth orbit for anti-alpha particles as of 2019 had found no unequivocal evidence.

Upon striking the atmosphere, cosmic rays violently burst atoms into other bits of matter, producing large amounts of pions and muons (produced from the decay of charged pions, which have a short half-life) as well as neutrinos. The neutron composition of the particle cascade increases at lower elevations, reaching between 40% and 80% of the radiation at aircraft altitudes.

Of secondary cosmic rays, the charged pions produced by primary cosmic rays in the atmosphere swiftly decay, emitting muons. Unlike pions, these muons do not interact strongly with matter, and can travel through the atmosphere to penetrate even below ground level. The rate of muons arriving at the surface of the Earth is such that about one per second passes through a volume the size of a person&#x27;s head. Together with natural local radioactivity, these muons are a significant cause of the ground level atmospheric ionisation that first attracted the attention of scientists, leading to the eventual discovery of the primary cosmic rays arriving from beyond our atmosphere.

==Energy==
Cosmic rays attract great interest practically, due to the damage they inflict on microelectronics and life outside the protection of an atmosphere and magnetic field, and scientifically, because the energies of the most energetic ultra-high-energy cosmic rays have been observed to approach (This is slightly greater than 21 million times the design energy of particles accelerated by the Large Hadron Collider, .) One can show that such enormous energies might be achieved by means of the centrifugal mechanism of acceleration in active galactic nuclei. At , the highest-energy ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (such as the OMG particle recorded in 1991) have energies comparable to the kinetic energy of a baseball. As a result of these discoveries, there has been interest in investigating cosmic rays of even greater energies. Most cosmic rays, however, do not have such extreme energies; the energy distribution of cosmic rays peaks at .

==History==
After the discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel in 1896, it was generally believed that atmospheric electricity, ionization of the air, was caused only by radiation from radioactive elements in the ground or the radioactive gases or isotopes of radon they produce. Measurements of increasing ionization rates at increasing heights above the ground during the decade from 1900 to 1910 could be explained as due to absorption of the ionizing radiation by the intervening air.

===Discovery===

In 1909, Theodor Wulf developed an electrometer, a device to measure the rate of ion production inside a hermetically sealed container, and used it to show higher levels of radiation at the top of the Eiffel Tower than at its base. However, his paper published in &quot;Physikalische Zeitschrift&quot; was not widely accepted. In 1911, Domenico Pacini observed simultaneous variations of the rate of ionization over a lake, over the sea, and at a depth of 3 metres from the surface. Pacini concluded from the decrease of radioactivity underwater that a certain part of the ionization must be due to sources other than the radioactivity of the Earth.

In 1912, Victor Hess carried three enhanced-accuracy Wulf electrometers to an altitude of 5,300 metres in a free balloon flight. He found the ionization rate increased to twice the rate at ground level. Hess ruled out the Sun as the radiation&#x27;s source by making a balloon ascent during a near-total eclipse. With the moon blocking much of the Sun&#x27;s visible radiation, Hess still measured rising radiation at rising altitudes. He concluded that &quot;The results of the observations seem most likely to be explained by the assumption that radiation of very high penetrating power enters from above into our atmosphere.&quot; In 1913–1914, Werner Kolhörster confirmed Victor Hess&#x27;s earlier results by measuring the increased ionization enthalpy rate at an altitude of 9 km. Hess received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1936 for his discovery.
===Identification===
Bruno Rossi wrote in 1964:
In the late 1920s and early 1930s the technique of self-recording electroscopes carried by balloons into the highest layers of the atmosphere or sunk to great depths under water was brought to an unprecedented degree of perfection by the German physicist Erich Regener and his group. To these scientists we owe some of the most accurate measurements ever made of cosmic-ray ionization as a function of altitude and depth.

Ernest Rutherford stated in 1931 that &quot;thanks to the fine experiments of Professor Millikan and the even more far-reaching experiments of Professor Regener, we have now got for the first time, a curve of absorption of these radiations in water which we may safely rely upon&quot;.

In the 1920s, the term &quot;cosmic ray&quot; was coined by Robert Millikan who made measurements of ionization due to cosmic rays from deep under water to high altitudes and around the globe. Millikan believed that his measurements proved that the primary cosmic rays were gamma rays; i.e., energetic photons. And he proposed a theory that they were produced in interstellar space as by-products of the fusion of hydrogen atoms into the heavier elements, and that secondary electrons were produced in the atmosphere by Compton scattering of gamma rays. In 1927, while sailing from Java to the Netherlands, Jacob Clay found evidence, later confirmed in many experiments, that cosmic ray intensity increases from the tropics to mid-latitudes, which indicated that the primary cosmic rays are deflected by the geomagnetic field and must therefore be charged particles, not photons. In 1929, Bothe and Kolhörster discovered charged cosmic-ray particles that could penetrate 4.1 cm of gold. Charged particles of such high energy could not possibly be produced by photons from Millikan&#x27;s proposed interstellar fusion process.

In 1930, Bruno Rossi predicted a difference between the intensities of cosmic rays arriving from the east and the west that depends upon the charge of the primary particles—the so-called &quot;east–west effect&quot;. Three independent experiments found that the intensity is, in fact, greater from the west, proving that most primaries are positive. During the years from 1930 to 1945, a wide variety of investigations confirmed that the primary cosmic rays are mostly protons, and the secondary radiation produced in the atmosphere is primarily electrons, photons and muons. In 1948, observations with nuclear emulsions carried by balloons to near the top of the atmosphere showed that approximately 10% of the primaries are helium nuclei (alpha particles) and 1% are nuclei of heavier elements such as carbon, iron, and lead.

During a test of his equipment for measuring the east–west effect, Rossi observed that the rate of near-simultaneous discharges of two widely separated Geiger counters was larger than the expected accidental rate. In his report on the experiment, Rossi wrote &quot;... it seems that once in a while the recording equipment is struck by very extensive showers of particles, which causes coincidences between the counters, even placed at large distances from one another.&quot; In 1937, Pierre Auger, unaware of Rossi&#x27;s earlier report, detected the same phenomenon and investigated it in some detail. He concluded that high-energy primary cosmic-ray particles interact with air nuclei high in the atmosphere, initiating a cascade of secondary interactions that ultimately yield a shower of electrons, and photons that reach ground level.

Soviet physicist Sergei Vernov was the first to use radiosondes to perform cosmic ray readings with an instrument carried to high altitude by a balloon. On 1 April 1935, he took measurements at heights up to 13.6 kilometres using a pair of Geiger counters in an anti-coincidence circuit to avoid counting secondary ray showers.

Homi J. Bhabha derived an expression for the probability of scattering positrons by electrons, a process now known as Bhabha scattering. His classic paper, jointly with Walter Heitler, published in 1937 described how primary cosmic rays from space interact with the upper atmosphere to produce particles observed at the ground level. Bhabha and Heitler explained the cosmic ray shower formation by the cascade production of gamma rays and positive and negative electron pairs.

===Energy distribution===
Measurements of the energy and arrival directions of the ultra-high-energy primary cosmic rays by the techniques of &quot;density sampling&quot; and &quot;fast timing&quot; of extensive air showers were first carried out in 1954 by members of the Rossi Cosmic Ray Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The experiment employed eleven scintillation detectors arranged within a circle 460 metres in diameter on the grounds of the Agassiz Station of the Harvard College Observatory. From that work, and from many other experiments carried out all over the world, the energy spectrum of the primary cosmic rays is now known to extend beyond 1020 eV. A huge air shower experiment called the Auger Project is currently operated at a site on the Pampas of Argentina by an international consortium of physicists. The project was first led by James Cronin, winner of the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics from the University of Chicago, and Alan Watson of the University of Leeds, and later by scientists of the international Pierre Auger Collaboration. Their aim is to explore the properties and arrival directions of the very highest-energy primary cosmic rays. The results are expected to have important implications for particle physics and cosmology, due to a theoretical Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit to the energies of cosmic rays from long distances (about 160 million light years) which occurs above 1020 eV because of interactions with the remnant photons from the Big Bang origin of the universe. Currently the Pierre Auger Observatory is undergoing an upgrade to improve its accuracy and find evidence for the yet unconfirmed origin of the most energetic cosmic rays.

High-energy gamma rays (&gt;50MeV photons) were finally discovered in the primary cosmic radiation by an MIT experiment carried on the OSO-3 satellite in 1967. Components of both galactic and extra-galactic origins were separately identified at intensities much less than 1% of the primary charged particles. Since then, numerous satellite gamma-ray observatories have mapped the gamma-ray sky. The most recent is the Fermi Observatory, which has produced a map showing a narrow band of gamma ray intensity produced in discrete and diffuse sources in our galaxy, and numerous point-like extra-galactic sources distributed over the celestial sphere.

==Modulation==

The solar cycle causes variations in the magnetic field of the solar wind through which cosmic rays propagate to Earth.
This results in a modulation of the arriving fluxes at lower energies, as detected indirectly by the globally distributed neutron monitor network.

==Sources==
Early speculation on the sources of cosmic rays included a 1934 proposal by Baade and Zwicky suggesting cosmic rays originated from supernovae. A 1948 proposal by Horace W. Babcock suggested that magnetic variable stars could be a source of cosmic rays. Subsequently, Sekido &quot;et al.&quot; (1951) identified the Crab Nebula as a source of cosmic rays. Since then, a wide variety of potential sources for cosmic rays began to surface, including supernovae, active galactic nuclei, quasars, and gamma-ray bursts.
Later experiments have helped to identify the sources of cosmic rays with greater certainty. In 2009, a paper presented at the International Cosmic Ray Conference by scientists at the Pierre Auger Observatory in Argentina showed ultra-high energy cosmic rays originating from a location in the sky very close to the radio galaxy Centaurus A, although the authors specifically stated that further investigation would be required to confirm Centaurus A as a source of cosmic rays. However, no correlation was found between the incidence of gamma-ray bursts and cosmic rays, causing the authors to set upper limits as low as 3.4 × 10−6× erg·cm−2 on the flux of cosmic rays from gamma-ray bursts.

In 2009, supernovae were said to have been &quot;pinned down&quot; as a source of cosmic rays, a discovery made by a group using data from the Very Large Telescope. This analysis, however, was disputed in 2011 with data from PAMELA, which revealed that &quot;spectral shapes of [hydrogen and helium nuclei] are different and cannot be described well by a single power law&quot;, suggesting a more complex process of cosmic ray formation. In February 2013, though, research analyzing data from &quot;Fermi&quot; revealed through an observation of neutral pion decay that supernovae were indeed a source of cosmic rays, with each explosion producing roughly 3 × 1042 – 3 × 1043J of cosmic rays.
Supernovae do not produce all cosmic rays, however, and the proportion of cosmic rays that they do produce is a question which cannot be answered without deeper investigation. To explain the actual process in supernovae and active galactic nuclei that accelerates the stripped atoms, physicists use shock front acceleration as a plausibility argument (see picture at right).

In 2017, the Pierre Auger Collaboration published the observation of a weak anisotropy in the arrival directions of the highest energy cosmic rays. Since the Galactic Center is in the deficit region, this anisotropy can be interpreted as evidence for the extragalactic origin of cosmic rays at the highest energies. This implies that there must be a transition energy from galactic to extragalactic sources, and there may be different types of cosmic-ray sources contributing to different energy ranges.

==Types==
Cosmic rays can be divided into two types:
* galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and extragalactic cosmic rays, i.e., high-energy particles originating outside the solar system, and
* solar energetic particles, high-energy particles (predominantly protons) emitted by the sun, primarily in solar eruptions.
However, the term &quot;cosmic ray&quot; is often used to refer to only the extrasolar flux.
Cosmic rays originate as primary cosmic rays, which are those originally produced in various astrophysical processes. Primary cosmic rays are composed mainly of protons and alpha particles (99%), with a small amount of heavier nuclei (≈1%) and an extremely minute proportion of positrons and antiprotons. Secondary cosmic rays, caused by a decay of primary cosmic rays as they impact an atmosphere, include photons, hadrons, and leptons, such as electrons, positrons, muons, and pions. The latter three of these were first detected in cosmic rays.

===Primary cosmic rays===
Primary cosmic rays mostly originate from outside the Solar System and sometimes even outside the Milky Way. When they interact with Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, they are converted to secondary particles. The mass ratio of helium to hydrogen nuclei, 28%, is similar to the primordial elemental abundance ratio of these elements, 24%. The remaining fraction is made up of the other heavier nuclei that are typical nucleosynthesis end products, primarily lithium, beryllium, and boron. These nuclei appear in cosmic rays in greater abundance (≈1%) than in the solar atmosphere, where they are only about 10 as abundant (by number) as helium. Cosmic rays composed of charged nuclei heavier than helium are called HZE ions. Due to the high charge and heavy nature of HZE ions, their contribution to an astronaut&#x27;s radiation dose in space is significant even though they are relatively scarce.

This abundance difference is a result of the way in which secondary cosmic rays are formed. Carbon and oxygen nuclei collide with interstellar matter to form lithium, beryllium, and boron, an example of cosmic ray spallation. Spallation is also responsible for the abundances of scandium, titanium, vanadium, and manganese ions in cosmic rays produced by collisions of iron and nickel nuclei with interstellar matter.

At high energies the composition changes and heavier nuclei have larger abundances in some energy ranges. Current experiments aim at more accurate measurements of the composition at high energies.

====Primary cosmic ray antimatter====

Satellite experiments have found evidence of positrons and a few antiprotons in primary cosmic rays, amounting to less than 1% of the particles in primary cosmic rays. These do not appear to be the products of large amounts of antimatter from the Big Bang, or indeed complex antimatter in the universe. Rather, they appear to consist of only these two elementary particles, newly made in energetic processes.

Preliminary results from the presently operating Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (&quot;AMS-02&quot;) on board the International Space Station show that positrons in the cosmic rays arrive with no directionality. In September 2014, new results with almost twice as much data were presented in a talk at CERN and published in Physical Review Letters. A new measurement of positron fraction up to 500 GeV was reported, showing that positron fraction peaks at a maximum of about 16% of total electron+positron events, around an energy of . At higher energies, up to 500 GeV, the ratio of positrons to electrons begins to fall again. The absolute flux of positrons also begins to fall before 500 GeV, but peaks at energies far higher than electron energies, which peak about 10 GeV. These results on interpretation have been suggested to be due to positron production in annihilation events of massive dark matter particles.

Cosmic ray antiprotons also have a much higher average energy than their normal-matter counterparts (protons). They arrive at Earth with a characteristic energy maximum of 2 GeV, indicating their production in a fundamentally different process from cosmic ray protons, which on average have only one-sixth of the energy.

There is no evidence of complex antimatter atomic nuclei, such as antihelium nuclei (i.e., anti-alpha particles), in cosmic rays. These are actively being searched for. A prototype of the &quot;AMS-02&quot; designated &quot;AMS-01&quot;, was flown into space aboard the on STS-91 in June 1998. By not detecting any antihelium at all, the &quot;AMS-01&quot; established an upper limit of for the antihelium to helium flux ratio.
===Secondary cosmic rays===
When cosmic rays enter the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, they collide with atoms and molecules, mainly oxygen and nitrogen. The interaction produces a cascade of lighter particles, a so-called air shower secondary radiation that rains down, including x-rays, protons, alpha particles, pions, muons, electrons, neutrinos, and neutrons. All of the secondary particles produced by the collision continue onward on paths within about one degree of the primary particle&#x27;s original path.

Typical particles produced in such collisions are neutrons and charged mesons such as positive or negative pions and kaons. Some of these subsequently decay into muons and neutrinos, which are able to reach the surface of the Earth. Some high-energy muons even penetrate for some distance into shallow mines, and most neutrinos traverse the Earth without further interaction. Others decay into photons, subsequently producing electromagnetic cascades. Hence, next to photons, electrons and positrons usually dominate in air showers. These particles as well as muons can be easily detected by many types of particle detectors, such as cloud chambers, bubble chambers, water-Cherenkov, or scintillation detectors. The observation of a secondary shower of particles in multiple detectors at the same time is an indication that all of the particles came from that event.

Cosmic rays impacting other planetary bodies in the Solar System are detected indirectly by observing high-energy gamma ray emissions by gamma-ray telescope. These are distinguished from radioactive decay processes by their higher energies above about 10 MeV.

===Cosmic-ray flux===

The flux of incoming cosmic rays at the upper atmosphere is dependent on the solar wind, the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, and the energy of the cosmic rays. At distances of ≈94 AU from the Sun, the solar wind undergoes a transition, called the termination shock, from supersonic to subsonic speeds. The region between the termination shock and the heliopause acts as a barrier to cosmic rays, decreasing the flux at lower energies (≤ 1 GeV) by about 90%. However, the strength of the solar wind is not constant, and hence it has been observed that cosmic ray flux is correlated with solar activity.

In addition, the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field acts to deflect cosmic rays from its surface, giving rise to the observation that the flux is apparently dependent on latitude, longitude, and azimuth angle.

The combined effects of all of the factors mentioned contribute to the flux of cosmic rays at Earth&#x27;s surface. The following table of participial frequencies reach the planet and are inferred from lower-energy radiation reaching the ground.

In the past, it was believed that the cosmic ray flux remained fairly constant over time. However, recent research suggests one-and-a-half- to two-fold millennium-timescale changes in the cosmic ray flux in the past forty thousand years.

The magnitude of the energy of cosmic ray flux in interstellar space is very comparable to that of other deep space energies: cosmic ray energy density averages about one electron-volt per cubic centimetre of interstellar space, or ≈1 eV/cm3, which is comparable to the energy density of visible starlight at 0.3 eV/cm3, the galactic magnetic field energy density (assumed 3 microgauss) which is ≈0.25 eV/cm3, or the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation energy density at ≈0.25 eV/cm3.

==Detection methods==

There are two main classes of detection methods. First, the direct detection of the primary cosmic rays in space or at high altitude by balloon-borne instruments. Second, the indirect detection of secondary particle, i.e., extensive air showers at higher energies. While there have been proposals and prototypes for space and balloon-borne detection of air showers, currently operating experiments for high-energy cosmic rays are ground based. Generally direct detection is more accurate than indirect detection. However the flux of cosmic rays decreases with energy, which hampers direct detection for the energy range above 1 PeV. Both direct and indirect detection are realized by several techniques.

===Direct detection===
Direct detection is possible by all kinds of particle detectors at the ISS, on satellites, or high-altitude balloons. However, there are constraints in weight and size limiting the choices of detectors.

An example for the direct detection technique is a method based on nuclear tracks developed by Robert Fleischer, P. Buford Price, and Robert M. Walker for use in high-altitude balloons. In this method, sheets of clear plastic, like 0.25 mm Lexan polycarbonate, are stacked together and exposed directly to cosmic rays in space or high altitude. The nuclear charge causes chemical bond breaking or ionization in the plastic. At the top of the plastic stack the ionization is less, due to the high cosmic ray speed. As the cosmic ray speed decreases due to deceleration in the stack, the ionization increases along the path. The resulting plastic sheets are &quot;etched&quot; or slowly dissolved in warm caustic sodium hydroxide solution, that removes the surface material at a slow, known rate. The caustic sodium hydroxide dissolves the plastic at a faster rate along the path of the ionized plastic. The net result is a conical etch pit in the plastic. The etch pits are measured under a high-power microscope (typically 1600× oil-immersion), and the etch rate is plotted as a function of the depth in the stacked plastic.

This technique yields a unique curve for each atomic nucleus from 1 to 92, allowing identification of both the charge and energy of the cosmic ray that traverses the plastic stack. The more extensive the ionization along the path, the higher the charge. In addition to its uses for cosmic-ray detection, the technique is also used to detect nuclei created as products of nuclear fission.

===Indirect detection===
There are several ground-based methods of detecting cosmic rays currently in use, which can be divided in two main categories: the detection of secondary particles forming extensive air showers (EAS) by various types of particle detectors, and the detection of electromagnetic radiation emitted by EAS in the atmosphere.

Extensive air shower arrays made of particle detectors measure the charged particles which pass through them. EAS arrays can observe a broad area of the sky and can be active more than 90% of the time. However, they are less able to segregate background effects from cosmic rays than can air Cherenkov telescopes. Most state-of-the-art EAS arrays employ plastic scintillators. Also water (liquid or frozen) is used as a detection medium through which particles pass and produce Cherenkov radiation to make them detectable. Therefore, several arrays use water/ice-Cherenkov detectors as alternative or in addition to scintillators.
By the combination of several detectors, some EAS arrays have the capability to distinguish muons from lighter secondary particles (photons, electrons, positrons). The fraction of muons among the secondary particles is one traditional way to estimate the mass composition of the primary cosmic rays.

An historic method of secondary particle detection still used for demonstration purposes involves the use of cloud chambers to detect the secondary muons created when a pion decays. Cloud chambers in particular can be built from widely available materials and can be constructed even in a high-school laboratory. A fifth method, involving bubble chambers, can be used to detect cosmic ray particles.

More recently, the CMOS devices in pervasive smartphone cameras have been proposed as a practical distributed network to detect air showers from ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The first app to exploit this proposition was the CRAYFIS (Cosmic RAYs Found in Smartphones) experiment. In 2017, the CREDO (Cosmic-Ray Extremely Distributed Observatory) Collaboration released the first version of its completely open source app for Android devices. Since then the collaboration has attracted the interest and support of many scientific institutions, educational institutions, and members of the public around the world. Future research has to show in what aspects this new technique can compete with dedicated EAS arrays.

The first detection method in the second category is called the air Cherenkov telescope, designed to detect low-energy (&lt;200 GeV) cosmic rays by means of analyzing their Cherenkov radiation, which for cosmic rays are gamma rays emitted as they travel faster than the speed of light in their medium, the atmosphere. While these telescopes are extremely good at distinguishing between background radiation and that of cosmic-ray origin, they can only function well on clear nights without the Moon shining, have very small fields of view, and are only active for a few percent of the time.

A second method detects the light from nitrogen fluorescence caused by the excitation of nitrogen in the atmosphere by particles moving through the atmosphere. This method is the most accurate for cosmic rays at highest energies, in particular when combined with EAS arrays of particle detectors. Similar to the detection of Cherenkov-light, this method is restricted to clear nights.

Another method detects radio waves emitted by air showers. This technique has a high duty cycle similar to that of particle detectors. The accuracy of this technique was improved in the last years as shown by various prototype experiments, and may become an alternative to the detection of atmospheric Cherenkov-light and fluorescence light, at least at high energies.

==Effects==

===Changes in atmospheric chemistry===
Cosmic rays ionize nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the atmosphere, which leads to a number of chemical reactions. Cosmic rays are also responsible for the continuous production of a number of unstable isotopes, such as carbon-14, in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere through the reaction:

Cosmic rays kept the level of carbon-14 in the atmosphere roughly constant (70 tons) for at least the past 100,000 years, until the beginning of above-ground nuclear weapons testing in the early 1950s. This fact is used in radiocarbon dating.

====Reaction products of primary cosmic rays, radioisotope half-lifetime, and production reaction====

===Role in ambient radiation===
Cosmic rays constitute a fraction of the annual radiation exposure of human beings on the Earth, averaging 0.39mSv out of a total of 3mSv per year (13% of total background) for the Earth&#x27;s population. However, the background radiation from cosmic rays increases with altitude, from 0.3mSv per year for sea-level areas to 1.0mSv per year for higher-altitude cities, raising cosmic radiation exposure to a quarter of total background radiation exposure for populations of said cities. Airline crews flying long-distance high-altitude routes can be exposed to 2.2mSv of extra radiation each year due to cosmic rays, nearly doubling their total exposure to ionizing radiation.


===Effect on electronics===
Cosmic rays have sufficient energy to alter the states of circuit components in electronic integrated circuits, causing transient errors to occur (such as corrupted data in electronic memory devices or incorrect performance of CPUs) often referred to as &quot;soft errors&quot;. This has been a problem in electronics at extremely high-altitude, such as in satellites, but with transistors becoming smaller and smaller, this is becoming an increasing concern in ground-level electronics as well. Studies by IBM in the 1990s suggest that computers typically experience about one cosmic-ray-induced error per 256 megabytes of RAM per month. To alleviate this problem, the Intel Corporation has proposed a cosmic ray detector that could be integrated into future high-density microprocessors, allowing the processor to repeat the last command following a cosmic-ray event. ECC memory is used to protect data against data corruption caused by cosmic rays.

In 2008, data corruption in a flight control system caused an Airbus A330 airliner to twice plunge hundreds of feet, resulting in injuries to multiple passengers and crew members. Cosmic rays were investigated among other possible causes of the data corruption, but were ultimately ruled out as being very unlikely.

In August 2020, scientists reported that ionizing radiation from environmental radioactive materials and cosmic rays may substantially limit the coherence times of qubits if they are not shielded adequately which may be critical for realizing fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computers in the future.

===Significance to aerospace travel===

Galactic cosmic rays are one of the most important barriers standing in the way of plans for interplanetary travel by crewed spacecraft. Cosmic rays also pose a threat to electronics placed aboard outgoing probes. In 2010, a malfunction aboard the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; space probe was credited to a single flipped bit, probably caused by a cosmic ray. Strategies such as physical or magnetic shielding for spacecraft have been considered in order to minimize the damage to electronics and human beings caused by cosmic rays.

On 31 May 2013, NASA scientists reported that a possible crewed mission to Mars may involve a greater radiation risk than previously believed, based on the amount of energetic particle radiation detected by the RAD on the Mars Science Laboratory while traveling from the Earth to Mars in 2011–2012.

Flying high, passengers and crews of jet airliners are exposed to at least 10 times the cosmic ray dose that people at sea level receive. Aircraft flying polar routes near the geomagnetic poles are at particular risk.

===Role in lightning===
Cosmic rays have been implicated in the triggering of electrical breakdown in lightning. It has been proposed that essentially all lightning is triggered through a relativistic process, or &quot;runaway breakdown&quot;, seeded by cosmic ray secondaries. Subsequent development of the lightning discharge then occurs through &quot;conventional breakdown&quot; mechanisms.

===Postulated role in climate change===
A role for cosmic rays in climate was suggested by Edward P. Ney in 1959 and by Robert E. Dickinson in 1975. It has been postulated that cosmic rays may have been responsible for major climatic change and mass extinction in the past. According to Adrian Mellott and Mikhail Medvedev, 62-million-year cycles in biological marine populations correlate with the motion of the Earth relative to the galactic plane and increases in exposure to cosmic rays. The researchers suggest that this and gamma ray bombardments deriving from local supernovae could have affected cancer and mutation rates, and might be linked to decisive alterations in the Earth&#x27;s climate, and to the mass extinctions of the Ordovician.

Danish physicist Henrik Svensmark has controversially argued that because solar variation modulates the cosmic ray flux on Earth, it would consequently affect the rate of cloud formation and hence be an indirect cause of global warming. Svensmark is one of several scientists outspokenly opposed to the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming, leading to concerns that the proposition that cosmic rays are connected to global warming could be ideologically biased rather than scientifically based. Other scientists have vigorously criticized Svensmark for sloppy and inconsistent work: one example is adjustment of cloud data that understates error in lower cloud data, but not in high cloud data; another example is &quot;incorrect handling of the physical data&quot; resulting in graphs that do not show the correlations they claim to show. Despite Svensmark&#x27;s assertions, galactic cosmic rays have shown no statistically significant influence on changes in cloud cover, and have been demonstrated in studies to have no causal relationship to changes in global temperature.

===Possible mass extinction factor===

A handful of studies conclude that a nearby supernova or series of supernovas caused the Pliocene marine megafauna extinction event by substantially increasing radiation levels to hazardous amounts for large seafaring animals.

<text>In chess, a fork is a tactic in which a piece multiple enemy pieces simultaneously. The attacker usually aims to capture one of the forked pieces. The defender often cannot counter every threat. A fork is most effective when it is , such as when the king is put in check. A fork is a type of .

== Terminology ==
A fork is an example of a . The type of fork is named after the type of forking piece. For example, a fork by a knight is a &quot;knight fork&quot;. The attacked pieces are &quot;forked&quot;. If the king is one of the attacked pieces, the term &quot;absolute fork&quot; is sometimes used, while a fork not involving the enemy king is a &quot;relative fork&quot;.

A fork of the king and queen, the highest material-gaining fork possible, is sometimes called a &quot;royal fork&quot;. A fork of the enemy king, queen, and one (or both) rooks is sometimes called a &quot;grand fork&quot;. A knight fork of the enemy king, queen, and possibly other pieces is sometimes called a &quot;family fork&quot; or &quot;family check&quot;.

==Strategy==
While any piece can deliver a fork, knights are particularly effective at creating forks because they cannot be captured by the pieces they attack, and as a minor piece they are less valuable than rooks and queens.

Compared to forks by other pieces, a queen fork requires more specific conditions to be helpful due to the queen&#x27;s higher value. However, a queen fork can often lead to material or positional gain when the forked pieces are undefended, poorly coordinated, or when one piece is the king.

==Game examples==

This example is from the first round of the FIDE World Chess Championship 2004 between Mohamed Tissir and Alexey Dreev. After 

:33... Nf2+ 34. Kg1 Nd3

White resigned. In the final position the black knight forks White&#x27;s queen and rook; after the queen moves away, Black will win the exchange.
This example is from the ninth round of the Clarin GP Final between Guillermo Soppe and Fernando Braga. After 

:40... Qh1+

White resigned. The only move is 41.Ke2 which enables a royal fork with 41...Nc3+, winning the queen.
 

In the Two Knights Defense (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6) after 4.Nc3, Black can eliminate White&#x27;s e4-pawn immediately with 
:4... Nxe4 

due to the &quot;fork trick&quot; 
:5. Nxe4 d5

regaining either the bishop or the knight.

<text>Backyard Blitz was a Logie Award winning Australian lifestyle and DIY television program that aired on the Nine Network between 2000 through to 2007 before its cancellation. It was hosted by Jamie Durie and was created by Don Burke and produced by his CTC Productions team.

==Overview==

The show featured a very similar premise to the show &quot;Ground Force&quot;, in which a team of gardeners employed by the show descend on a supposedly worthy individual&#x27;s place and improve the garden for the cameras within a specified time limit. This similarity led to legal action being taken by the rival Seven Network, which at the time was set to debut an Australian version of &quot;Ground Force&quot;. Seven ultimately lost its claim as Don Burke&#x27;s CTC was able to argue that Burke&#x27;s previous program &quot;Burke&#x27;s Backyard&quot; had featured backyard garden renovations which they claimed naturally morphed into the &quot;Backyard Blitz&quot; concept.

The four regular presenters on the show were landscaper Jamie Durie (the main host and the show&#x27;s lead landscaper), Scott Cam (builder/carpenter), Nigel Ruck (landscaper) and Jody Rigby (horticulturist). The show would launch the television careers of Durie, Rigby and Cam; Durie and Cam would later become hosts of Nine&#x27;s successful reality television show &quot;The Block&quot; during different seasons.

During its run the show was immensely popular across all demographics; it regularly won its time slot and consistently ranked in the top 20 national shows at year&#x27;s end. However, on 14 November 2006 &quot;Backyard Blitz&quot; was axed by the Nine Network after seven years on air. Don Burke, whose own show &quot;Burke&#x27;s Backyard&quot; was broadcast by Nine for nearly 18 years before it was axed in 2004, said his production company was &quot;quite shocked by this decision&quot;. In mid-2007 Nine aired the six remaining unaired episodes that were filmed before the show was cancelled.

In 2008, Nine started airing a spin-off show called &quot;Domestic Blitz&quot;, hosted by Cam and Shelley Craft. The show lasted until 2010, encompassing 4 seasons.

==Awards==
During the show&#x27;s run, &quot;Backyard Blitz&quot; has won (and been nominated) for several Logie Awards. The show won six consecutive &#x27;Most Popular Lifestyle Program&#x27; awards (2002–2006), and was nominated in the same category in 2007 but lost. Jamie Durie won the &#x27;Most Popular New Male Talent&#x27; in 2001 and was nominated for &#x27;Most Popular TV Presenter&#x27; in 2005 and 2006 for his role on the show.

<text>Jamie Paul Durie (born 3 June 1970) is an Australian horticulturalist and landscape designer, furniture designer, television host, television producer, and author of eleven books on landscape architecture, garden design and lifestyle. 

Durie was the television host of the 2008 Australian lifestyle program &quot;The Outdoor Room&quot;, broadcast on the Seven Network. He hosted the dynamic design makeover show &quot;HGTV Showdown&quot; in 2009. Durie hosted the US PBS series &quot;The Victory Garden&quot; from 2007 to 2010. The show is PBS network&#x27;s longest-running gardening TV series.

Following the end of &quot;The Outdoor Room&quot; on the Seven Network in 2010, Durie adapted the series the American HGTV network with a new team of designers, horticulturists and contractors.

In November 2024,&quot;Growing Home with Jamie Durie&quot; aired on Channel 7, a series in which Durie documented making his family home sustainable and off-grid.

==Early life==
Durie was born in Manly, New South Wales, and spent his formative years living in Tom Price, Western Australia. His maternal grandmother, Daphne de Zylva, was born in Sri Lanka and met his English grandfather in the air force during World War II. They moved to Australia in the 1950s. His parents separated when Durie was age 10, and he relocated with his mother and brother, Clyde Hep, to the Gold Coast. His paternal grandmother was a volunteer surf-lifesaver on the NSW Central Coast. 

Having left high-school in Brisbane at age 15, he tried his hand at cabinetmaking and modeled beachwear part-time. Durie got his showbiz start in his teens as an exotic dancer in the all-male revue troupe, Manpower Australia, with whom he toured for seven years. At age 26, he completed a four-year horticultural and landscape design course.

==Landscape design and television hosting==
Durie founded the landscape design company, Patio Landscape Architecture and Design, in 1998. In 2002, Durie registered the Australian business company, &quot;JPD Media &amp; Design&quot;. He then hosted the TV series &quot;Backyard Blitz&quot;
 and &quot;The Block&quot;.

In 2007, Durie participated in the 6th Australian series of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, in which he was eliminated in 7th place, on 17 April 2007.
In 2007, Durie hosted &quot;Australia&#x27;s Best Backyards&quot; on the Seven Network. The show was a lifestyle garden program, similar to &quot;Backyard Blitz&quot; on the Nine Network.

In 2007, Durie has filmed lifestyle segments with Oprah Winfrey, on the Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel), whom he credits as giving him his US TV breakthrough. Durie states that Winfrey &quot;wholly and solely&quot; is responsible for his career being launched in the US. When Oprah came calling, Durie relocated to the US. And with her ringing endorsement it meant

Durie hosted the US PBS series &quot;The Victory Garden&quot; from 2007 to 2010. Durie hosted the dynamic design makeover show &quot;HGTV Showdown&quot; on the HGTV network in 2009.

In 2008, Durie was the television host of the Australian lifestyle program &quot;The Outdoor Room&quot;, broadcast on Seven Network, with repeats broadcast on 7Two. The premise of the show was that Durie set out to &quot;bring the world to your very own backyard&quot;.

Following the end of &quot;The Outdoor Room&quot; show on the Seven Network, in 2010, Durie relocated the concept of the series to broadcast on the HGTV network as &quot;The Outdoor Room with Jamie Durie&quot;. Unable to bring his own Australian design team along, Durie put together a new team of designers, horticulturists and contractors. In his HGTV series, Durie rescues forlorn yards in Southern California with design schemes inspired by gardens and landscapes from around the world. Filmed mostly in and around Los Angeles, &quot;The Outdoor Room with Jamie Durie&quot; uses sustainable ideas, such as low-water plantings and reclaimed hardscape, to design intimate, livable environments for erstwhile non-gardeners.

Since 2015, Durie has co-presented as a visiting expert in gardening &amp; landscaping, on the Australian lifestyle program, &quot;The Living Room&quot;, a quad-triple award-winner of the Logie Award for Most Popular Lifestyle Program, that airs on Network Ten.

In 2019, Durie joined Australia&#x27;s Seven Network reality renovation series House Rules as a new judge.

In August 2022, Durie was revealed to be the Tiger on the fourth season of Network 10&#x27;s &quot;The Masked Singer Australia.&quot;

In November 2024 &quot;Growing Home with Jamie Durie&quot; is Jamie Durie&#x27;s latest television program, aired on Channel 7 and 7plus. This four-part series chronicles the three-year process of designing and building a &quot;sustainable, off-grid&quot; family home.

==Furniture design and merchandise lines==
In 2010, Durie&#x27;s company &quot;Patio Landscape Architecture and Design&quot; was renamed &quot;Durie Design&quot;, committed to not just rejuvenating the existing gardens, but offering new exciting outdoor destinations for the clients, and with an emphasis on funky furniture design.

With his furniture design success, Durie has worked for Hollywood celebrity clients, such as designing 100 pieces of furniture for American talk show host and comedian Chelsea Handler and he designed garden landscapes for actress Charlize Theron for two years.

In November 2024, Jamie Durie relaunched &quot;Patio by Jamie Durie&quot;, his signature outdoor living and lifestyle brand. With the iconic vertical garden blankets, aimed at transforming outdoor spaces into beautiful, functional, and eco-friendly sanctuaries. The relaunch reflects Durie’s enduring passion for connecting people with nature through thoughtful design, encouraging sustainable living, and enhancing the way we experience the outdoors.

==Awards and accolades==
The Australian reality television garden makeover program &quot;Backyard Blitz&quot;, on the Nine Network, was the winner of six Logie Awards of &quot;Most Popular Lifestyle Program&quot; (from 2001 until 2006). Durie won the Logie Award for the &quot;Most Popular New Talent&quot; award in 2001, and was nominated for the &quot;Most Popular Presenter&quot; award for his role in &quot;Backyard Blitz&quot; from 2003 to 2005.

Durie&#x27;s 2003 landscape design book, &quot;Patio - Garden Design and Inspiration&quot;, (Allen &amp; Unwin - ) was short-listed APA Book Design Awards, for Best Designed Illustrated Book 2003 Australia.

In 2008, Durie won a gold medal at Britain&#x27;s prestigious Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) Chelsea Flower Show in Chelsea, London. A team of 22 workers built the AU$800,000, 200sqm celebration of the Kimberley landscape, called &quot;Australian Garden and designed by Durie&quot;, in 16 days. &quot;Australian Garden&quot; won one of the eight Gold Medals given in the Show Garden category. All the materials were shipped from Australia.

In 2012, Durie was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for services to the environment, and charity work.

In 2013, Durie began collaborating with the Italian luxury furniture brand Natuzzi Group Riva 1920. Durie and Riva 1920 launched a bespoke collection of five furniture pieces, including the &quot;Tubular&quot; dining table, to widespread acclaim at Milan Furniture Fair 2013. The &quot;Tubular&quot; table and chair (the range also includes bookshelves) and Durie&#x27;s &quot;Bungalow range&quot; were both finalists in the New York Design Awards, announced in Manhattan on 20 May 2014, for Product Design Category, &quot;Furniture Indoor &amp; Outdoor&quot;.

<doc id="47694" wikidata="Q828074" url="?curid=47694" title="Pin (chess)">
<text>In chess, a pin is a tactic in which a defending piece cannot move out of an attacking piece&#x27;s line of attack without exposing a more valuable defending piece. Moving the attacking piece to effect the pin is called &quot;pinning&quot;; the defending piece restricted by the pin is described as &quot;pinned&quot;. Only a piece that can move any number of squares along a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line (i.e. a bishop, rook, or queen) can pin. Any piece can be pinned except the king. The pin is one of the most powerful chess tactics. 

The inverse of a pin is a &quot;skewer&quot;, in which a more valuable piece under direct attack may move to expose a less valuable piece to an attack.
== Types ==
=== Absolute pin ===
An &quot;absolute pin&quot; is one where the piece shielded by the pinned piece is the king. In this case it is illegal to move the pinned piece out of the line of attack, as that would place one&#x27;s king in check (see diagram). A piece pinned in this way can still give check or defend another piece from capture by the opposing king.

=== Relative pin ===
A &quot;relative pin&quot; is one where the piece shielded by the pinned piece is a piece other than the king, but typically is more valuable than the pinned piece. Moving such a pinned piece is legal but may not be prudent, as the shielded piece would then be vulnerable to capture.

=== Partial pin ===

Independently of whether it is absolute or relative, a pin might be a &quot;partial pin&quot;, in which the pinned piece can still move along the line of the pin, and it might be able to capture the piece that is pinning it, but it cannot leave that line. For example, a rook or queen can be partially pinned along a or , or a bishop or queen can be partially pinned along a . Capturing the pinning piece can still be advantageous to the pinning player, as in the example diagram (the pinning rook is defended, so capturing it with the queen would lose ).

A queen can only ever be partially pinned, as it can move in any linear direction, while a knight cannot be partially pinned due to its unique movement. The pawn is a more complex case; due to its limited and conditional movement, whether a pin on a pawn is partial depends on the line and direction of the pin and on whether there are opposing pieces available for it to capture.

It is possible for two opposing pieces to be partially pinning each other.

=== Situational pin ===

Sometimes a piece may be considered to be in a &quot;situational pin&quot;. Like a relative pin, a situational pin does not legally restrict the piece from moving, but moving the pinned piece out of the line of attack can result in some detriment to the player (e.g. checkmate, immediate loss of the game, occupation of a critical square by the opponent, etc.).

Consider the diagrammed position with White to move. The black bishop on d5 is unprotected and White can capture it with 1.Nxd5; however, White should not play the capture or otherwise move the knight, due to the skewer attack 1...Rb1+ winning White&#x27;s rook (the king is forced to move, then 2...Rxh1). It can be said that the white knight is &quot;pinned to the b1-square&quot; rather than pinned to a piece.

=== Cross-pin ===
A &quot;cross-pin&quot; consists of two or more pins, of any type, on the same piece. As there is only one king per side, only one of the pins can be absolute, but there are otherwise no restrictions on the types of pins involved.

== Pin combinations ==
Pinning can also be used in combination with other tactics. For example, a piece can be pinned to prevent it from moving to attack, or a defending piece can be pinned as part of tactic undermining an opponent&#x27;s defense. Another tactic which takes advantage of a pin can be called &quot;working the pin&quot;. In this tactic, other pieces from the pinning piece&#x27;s side attack the opposing pinned piece. Since the pinned piece cannot move out of the line of attack, the player whose piece is pinned may move other pieces to defend the pinned piece, but the pinning player may yet attack with even more pieces, etc. Using a battery of doubled rooks with a queen behind them to this end is known as Alekhine&#x27;s gun.

A pinned piece can usually no longer be counted on as a defender of another friendly piece or as an attacker of an opposing piece (unless the subject is still within the pinning line). However, a pinned piece can still give check to the opposing king, and therefore can still defend friendly pieces against captures made by the enemy king.

== Unpinning ==
The act of breaking a pin is &quot;unpinning&quot;. This can be executed in a number of ways: the piece creating the pin can be captured or chased away; another unit can be moved onto the line of the pin; the unit to which a piece is pinned can be moved; or, a relatively pinned piece can be moved despite the pin, such as in the Légal Trap and the Elephant Trap.

== Pins commonly seen in gameplay ==
A pinning move that often occurs in openings is Bb5 which, if Black has moved ...Nc6 and ...d6 or ...d5, pins the knight on c6, since moving the knight would expose the king on e8 to check. (The same may, of course, occur on the other , with a bishop on g5; or by Black on White, with a bishop on b4 or g4.)

== Examples from games ==

The diagram shows Vladimir Lenin–Maxim Gorky, Capri 1908, with White to move. Black is threatening the following rook sacrifice and : 
:27...Rh1+ 28.Kxh1 Qh2

White cannot play 27.gxh3, because the queen on g3 is pinning the pawn to the g-file. The only move that postpones the mate is 27.Nf4, which temporarily blocks Black&#x27;s bishop from protecting his queen, but to no avail as Black can simply play 27...Bxf4 renewing the mate threat. Or, Black can respond by mating a different way: 
:27.Nf4 Qh2+ 28.Kf2 Rhxf3#

In this case, White cannot capture 29.gxf3 because the queen now on h2 pins the pawn to the 2nd rank. With mate being inevitable, White resigned after move 26.
